{"text":"Customer service from both staff today was really great. So I ordered the matcha latte .... Drank it and my stomach turned it is really sweet! I don't mind sweet treats but when it comes to beverages I am only a fan of bitter and sour things.... They happily (literally with a smile) offered me another beverage. I felt pretty bad because I hate wasting but I just can not do sweet drinks.


FYI their matcha powder has sugar mixed into the packaging they get (just like Starbucks).... Which would be great ... Unless you are not looking for a sweet drink... 


Great news! Their soy latte is amazing! Deep rich coffee bitter flavor (which I love). I was very pleased by how calm and positive they both were with me as I am sure that was probably annoying to have to waste the product  More coffee shops should have this type of professional positive smiling customer first type of employees 


Location also has a fireplace which o imagine will be nice in the cold winter months. Washrooms are clean (probably because now they aren't bombarded with all the school children arroyos the area coming in and disrespectfully destroying it and leaving it messy every 30mins."}
{"text":"Le personnel y est des plus courtois et font souvent la différence sur le reste de ma journée après un épisode de traffic sur les ponts!!!! J'y vais presque tous les matins depuis presque 10 ans je dois dire que ce n'est pas faute d'avoir d'autres alternatives... Grand Diablo et muffin pomme canneberge duo de choix pour commencer ma journée!!

Bien sûr tout n'est pas parfait mais dans l'ensemble on sent une réelle volonté de faire plaisir au client... Je dois admettre que ce commentaire ne vaut que pour l'équipe du matin car pour y être allée à d'autres moments... Pas tout à fait la même atmosphère!!! Et il est vrai que parfois en fin de journée la propreté des lieux laisse à desirer.

Pour ce qui est de l'accès aux toilettes étant réservée à la clientèle payante (voir le commentaire de Matt B.)... Et bien non seulement je comprends mais j'approuve. Avec la foule bigarée qu'on peux retrouver sur le Plateau, qui sait quel objet indésirable on pourrait y retrouver ou dans quel état lamentable pourraient être ces dernières. Je prefere largement que le personnel se concentre à nous préparer notre elixir vital qu'à torcher les toilettes!!!"}
{"text":"Needed a lil pick-me-up at the end of our day and the Gingerbread latte was sooo good, too bad the guy behind the counter only made one drink for the two of us...I guess something got lost in translation. But other then that it was very yummy and pretty to look at"}
{"text":"It's a newly renovated Second cup! So everything is new, and the cafe overall has a hipster feel to it with wooden tables, walls and chairs. The cafe is also open 24 hours, so if you're looking for a place to work in the wee hours, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Not coming back. After seeing how the owner Becky treats her employees, i will not support her business"}
{"text":"Very nice and quiet place. I went there to meet an old friend. The coffee was good and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium sized caramel frappe, the barista made it really bitter and when I requested her to fix it, she asked me if I have ever had a frappe!! I replied I know how a frappe should taste like and it is far from what you have prepared. She then fixed it by adding some caramel syrup to it and stirred with a spoon, which did not help at all. I did not complain and left the place. I will never recommend this to any of my friends.."}
{"text":"Espresso is good and dark. The coffee is ok, I had to add some milk to it. The atmosphere is very inviting and plenty of seating for everyone. Outdoor seating is available and cool."}
{"text":"Coming from Vancouver this is one of the places that reminds me of home. It's pretty hard to find a place with almond milk in Ontario and were grateful that Second Cup has this milk alternative. The staff there were really friendly and made our experience a pleasant one."}
{"text":"It's really 3.5 stars, pretty much your regular Second Cup. Decent service and ample sitting room. It gets quite busy at nighttime especially on weekends. Can't really complain since it's my go to coffee store these days..."}
{"text":"Food: Love Flat White~ and thankfully the ones at Second Cup never failed~ Also at this new location in Sainte-Catherine, much more varieties of pastries and other food options~

Service: Had to remind the barista that she forgot our second Flat White, apologized++ and made it right away, did not compromise speed over quality however :) the service very quick also despite it was very busy

Price: avg for coffee

Ambiance: I love this new location, high ceiling, well illuminated, high bench and regular seats, busy but not nosy~"}
{"text":"Best Second Cup in Calgary.
For those who don't know, Second Cup offers a variety of beans, roasts and blends that actually taste different from each other, versus that other place where no matter what they call it, they all taste the same. SO if you truly appreciate coffee and variety, Second Cup should be your preferred destination.
BUT, the Shawville Boulevard location is the best of the best. Cynthia and her crew are amazingly friendly, the store is always clean, bright and cheerful, coffee is hot and fresh and they offer Light, Medium and Dark roasts as well as a Flavoured ready-to-go. And if you prefer a different blend than what's already made, they'll do a single pour for you. Plus, of course, all the specialties from Espresso to your low-this-double-that-whatever! Tea, hot chocolate and a good selection of food round out their offerings. (I'm partial to the Orange Cranberry Loaf, myself!)
Run in and grab a cup, or sit, relax and stay - you'll enjoy the best coffee experience either way!"}
{"text":"Of all the Coffee houses i've been to in my life....this location is TOPS. The staff are SUPER friendly and attract the same in their patrons. My 3yr old son even loves visiting the patio for a cookie with friends"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've seen in a coffee shop for a.long time. Perhaps I'm used to downtown where people at least try to smile even with the ridiculous long lines of morning rush.

The server is extremely quiet and I can barely hear her. When she is serving you, she seems to look into the space beyond almost as if she is devoid of this world and you are merely a piece of it that is fading away into eternity.

In all seriousness, perhaps it's just this particular skinny server. But anyone who comes here will know exactly what I'm talking about, as surreal as the description was.

Good day, folks."}
{"text":"Un bon expresso dans cette chaîne"}
{"text":"great place confortable and relax, but the music is too LOUUUUDDDD"}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times thinking that matters would improve but they never do.

This Second Cup is spacious, has a dark exterior with lots of seating by big windows which bring in lots of light. They always have a lot of baked goods and sandwiches. The staff is kind, and somewhat efficient. The drinks are usually consistent, but sometimes I don't even know what I'm drinking.

The major downfall about this place is the uncleanliness. My table has always been sticky whenever I've sat down. There have been times where it looks like a newspaper hurricane hit the place, and the bathroom is mucky.  I've also seen one of the barista pick at his flip-flops behind the counter while making drinks during the summer. So gross!

I'm not a big fan of this particular location; they're other Second Cup's in the area I can go to instead if I needed too."}
{"text":"Second Cup, oh how I miss you!

Loved coming here during the winter time during the treks to Walmart through the snow.
Very nice little place."}
{"text":"I used to come here and study whenever I get a chance in grade 11 and 12. I wished that I live in one of those condos near square one because of this second cup. Coffee is better than okay, but not amazing. I like the environment better than the coffee and food itself so there's that."}
{"text":"This is a really busy coffee shop during the school year.  Expect to wait in line when coming for coffee.  The coffee is good ... Better then Starbucks.  Half price lattes on Tuesday are nice as well."}
{"text":"I live across the street from this Second Cup. And I love SC overall, this location would have been decent if only it were cleaner and I understand its mostly the fault of the customers however on several occasions that I have gone there I was horrified to see the front door plastered with greesy fingerprint marks all over. It was a turn off... Still is...even though it's across the street from where I live, I will not visit them again."}
{"text":"Went here a bunch because the coffee was good but the waitress was extraordinarily rude when we came later on to pick up croissants"}
{"text":"Really cool place to hang out and/or to study because it's open 24hours and has comfortable seating area and good snacks! I used to spend so much time here back in the days :)"}
{"text":"Je suis un fan de starbust on m à forcer à essayer le chocolat de second cup .... Et je doit dire bravo!!!!! Je le préfère . niveau tarif c est pareil vous m avez convaincu  !!"}
{"text":"love second cup. always getting a cup when I am in Canada.
The location is large and has a indoor and outdoor seating.
Long opening hours. Lot of student customers since it is close to the University."}
{"text":"Friendly Service. Vibrant Atmosphere. Busy Location.

Like any chain coffee shop, the quality control isn't as consistent as it could be, but this is certainly one of the better Second Cup locations I frequent."}
{"text":"Even though it is a chain, i like it a lot especially for the below items: 

- White Moka
- Big Terrasse
- Free Wifi"}
{"text":"Concurrent direct de starbucks! J'ai adoré! A peu près la meme ambiance, mais j'ai bcp aimé les friandises proposées ^^
Telle une gourmande que je suis, je suis arrivée a mon stage avec du chocolat un peu sur les lèvres ;)
Seul hic, monsieur au comptoir est un peu lent, aussi bien a la détente que au service"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends. Good service. A bit crowded on peak hours so sometimes is difficult to find where to seat."}
{"text":"Service here is terrible. Staff is more interested in gossiping with each other than pouring coffee. The pastries taste like the are a few days old."}
{"text":"Mon café préféré, surtout pour sa grande terrasse où on peut lire relax le samedi ou dimanche matin. Je ne suis pas un connaisseur en café, j'en prends 1 ou 2 maximum par semaine, mais ceux que je prends là sont très bien. En boni, on peut regarder les touristes et les banlieusards se taper une heure ou deux dans la file d'attente pour aller déjeuner à L'Avenue, un voisin surévalué à mon avis (personnellement, je ne comprendrai jamais les gens qui attendent des heures pour prendre un déjeuner, mais bon, c'est une autre histoire)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and not as crowded as unionville coffee shops can be. Staff have always been great."}
{"text":"I came here with my mother for breakfast and food was great! I got the frozen hot chocolate with an apple baba and she got the vanilla bean latte with cheddar croissant. The atmosphere was nice and clean in the middle of everything so were finished eating when the shops were opening up. Drinks were good and the food was ok, nothing too special. Service was quick. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This location is closed as of March 11, 2016. Too bad! It was one of my regular coffee spots."}
{"text":"I was staying right down the street from Second Cup Café for a few days and it became my regular stop for my morning coffee. Service was friendly and prices were reasonable. I do wish that they had the beverage list available on English as well, but overall I was satisfied every visit."}
{"text":"This spot served as a safe haven for the cold. I'm not used to 7.F weather lol. In sheltering here, I was advices to try this by a few friends visiting Montreal too. This was deemed as the Canadian version of Starbucks. I ordered something simple, a café always does the job right. Medium café was smooth and this place had a milk bar which I thought was interesting."}
{"text":"To the new manager (July 2010).

 \"Releasing\" the three best staff in your first week in charge was foolish way to make your mark.  I had never been a regular at any coffee shop before, but these excellent people had my loyalty.  It was their charm and great personalities that kept me coming back.  One can only assume that you fired them in an attempt to start fresh and call the place your own.  Unfortunately that was the biggest mistake you could have made, as I have heard other customers, and even neighbouring business owners voice their unhappiness as well.

I will not be returning, and will instead opt for the Timothy's just south on Mount Pleasant, or more likely, go nowhere at all.  Good luck with your new position, and your big ego.  You'll need it."}
{"text":"Malheureusement seulement 3 étoiles pour un Second Cup .... L'endroit est est très beau, on a vraiment envie d'y travailler. En plus, C'EST GRAND alors ce serait surprenant qu'il n'y ait plus de place nulle part pour s'asseoir.

Le gros point négatif: Le Wifi !! Si tu réussis à te connecter, tu vas constater que c'est vraiment lent. Sinon, tu seras juste tout simplement jamais capable de te connecter! 

C'est vraiment dommage parce que pour le reste c'est très bien !! (À la hauteur des autres Second Cup que j'ai visité, et même plus)

Si tu veux juste jaser autour d'un café ou d'un peu de bouffe, go for it though !!"}
{"text":"Judge a restaurant by its bathroom.  It tells you everything you need to know about the food you are about to eat.   PS:  bring your own toilet paper as the bathrooms won't have any!!!"}
{"text":"Habitué à la franchise Starbucks, implanté en France et en Europe, j'ai pris un réel plaisir à prendre mes petits-déjeuners dans cette franchise qui se distingue par rapport à un Tim Hortons, un peu cheap, et au Starbucks trop souvent bondé.

Résident au cours de mon séjour dans le quartier du village, je dois dire que le personnel de la franchise localisé au 1351, rue Ste. Catherine E s'est montré arrangeant, m'autorisant même à charger mon téléphone sur leur comptoir.

Les amateurs de ristretto et d'expresso seront peut-être déçu de la teneur en café. 
Pour les moins hermétiques, je recommande les brownies et les yaourt aux céréales, le tout accompagné d'un café du jour servi dans une tasse/Mug en terre cuite (oui oui!) souvent aromatisé aux saveurs cocasses!"}
{"text":"I will never understand why coffee shops are built in clusters, in close proximity to each other.

The Mississauga City Centre has to be coffee overload for anyone looking to get their fix, as there are so many options within a one-block radius that it's staggering. I'd like to meet the designer who thought this would sit well a block away from a Starbucks and a Tim's, not to mention the dozen coffee shops inside Square One as it is.

I would have never found this place were it not for the fact that I was attending a show nearby at the LAC and wanted a quick coffee and snack. I made my way over here and found the experience to be pleasant, though the rough edges are definitely showing.

The first thing I noticed was the service. As others have said, the servers are a bit aloof but cordial. I ordered an Orange Spice tea and a slice of banana loaf, and one of them wished me goodbye and seemed to be expecting me to leave the counter while the other woman was getting my food. The right hand doesn't know what the left is doing, but the service is decent enough.

I was surprised by the amount of seating tucked away in the place (you definitely can't see it all from outside), but the padded seats I perched on were fraying and had definitely seen better days. Couple that with the existing power outlet problem (did no one bother to rewire/renovate when they opened this place? Did no one expect that?), and you can see why this place only has a middle-of-the-road rating.

That said, the tea's solid (can't really screw that up) and the loaf was fine. This Second Cup is fine for what it is, but it's not a place I'd go out of my way for again, especially with so many other options in the area."}
{"text":"I don't like their coffee much as its too dry for my liking. Their store location is great as its close to the Mississauga central library

This store size is not bad and allows them to provide good amount of seating and they also have free wifi. The plugs are available for using laptops.

The service is not too slow but not fast either so its not a hassle. The service was really good, the stadd were friendly and accommodating to the changes and request of people. 

Parking is a problem as the parking around the shop is paid street parking."}
{"text":"On parle souvent de Starbucks, mais sincèrement on pourrait dire que Second Cup l'égale! Les boissons et les gâteaux y sont délicieux, l'ambiance est conviviale et chaleureuse (voire même propice au travail) donne envie d'y retourner! 
Le service est très bon!
On peut rapidement oublier que c'est une chaîne! Au contraire, on est content de retrouver ce genre de café n'importe où dans Montréal!"}
{"text":"During the day this place is full of people camped out and working away on their laptops. In the evenings, it's full of visiting friends.

The building only has one floor but there is a raised section that somehow seems removed enough to limit the distractions of people coming in and out of the front door, the chit chat from behind the counter and whatever ordering/discussions are going on by the people who've come to socialize so if you're looking to work, make sure you choose a seat in this section.

The building itself has high cielings and two walls of big windows filling it with natural light and giving it a bright and airy feeling.

Their muffins, cakes and sandwiches are all on display and seem to go at a pretty impressive rate. I've had a taste of the lemon poppy muffin and it was delicious.

The two people working behind the counter during the day seem to be a husband and wife team. The two of them banter back and forth in a pretty comfortable way that definitely supports my theory. It's not english so I can't tell what they're saying but I'd be pretty surprised if they weren't married.

Anyway, apart from the slightly grundgy bathrooms this place seems pretty standard as far as Second Cup locations go."}
{"text":"The girl put my sandwich in the panini press sideways instead of right side up so the entire thing was a sloppy, burnt, wet mess and my hot chocolate was cold by the time I had walked 2 mins away. I called to let them know about it and the idiot on the phone responded \"uuuhhhh...uuummmm...ok? I'm not sure what you want me to do about it. I'll let them know next time to be careful, bye\" and hung up on me. lol???? I was perfectly polite with her but hanging up on me really pissed me off. Bad training and employees who completely lack social skills, and that's before I even mention the girl taking my order who I had to repeat to her 20 times what I wanted and all it was was a hot chocolate w/ a peppermint teabag in it???? I don't really care if you think a peppermint hot chocolate is weird, I'd appreciate it if you'd just take my goddamn order and make it. And all of this happened in an empty store, to me that says they were left on their own for a night shift with zero training and can't even speak to a customer without stuttering like an idiot. I manage a store and if my girls behaved that way I'd be sitting them down for a long talk about how to speak to people, and not to hang up on customers????"}
{"text":"Ordered a medium iced Americano. The cashier/barista was friendly and the Americano was up to my standards as a barista in a past life. It was strong and did not have the sour taste created by a bad roast."}
{"text":"J'aime particulièrement ce café en raison de sa superbe terrasse sur Mont-Royal. Elle est très grande et bien aérée.

Sinon pour le café... c'est la même chose que dans les autres second cup ! wifi gratuit :)"}
{"text":"Seul une grande entreprise comme Second Cup à les $$$$$ pour préserver un tel endroit. Un café 24h avec une grande terrasse au coins Parc et Milton c'est un petit trésor. Terminer une chaude soirée d'été sur la terrasse et vous serez conquis.... je gage sur ma victoire. Je préfère les petits cafés mais quelque fois les franchises ont leurs avantages...

Second Cup c'est Second Cup; café OK, sièges confortables, pâtisseries correctes WIFI, ... Mes préférences: cidre chaud, carré aux dates, gâteau au fromage et aux carottes le tous sur la terrasse si la température le permet. 
ATTENTION ne laissez pas votre ordinateur sans surveillance, les vols y sont fréquents.

Pourquoi 3/5: Pour des questions éthique je ne peu pas donner plus de 3/5 à un café de type franchise. Mais si je le compare à ses semblable c'est au minimum un 4/5. Les employés sont vraiment sympathique. Dans les circonstances c'est vraiment propre comme endroit. Le WIFI fonctionne super bien.

En période d'examen c'est très très très plein."}
{"text":"I like to support Canadian things even when my love is elsewhere (Starbucks). I always had a special place for Second Cup and I do enjoy a Skinny Vanilla Bean latte every once and awhile. 

I have to say though this location is just alright. Depending on when you go you can get either good service or bad. I went on a Thursday at 8AM and had wonderful fast service with a delicious drink but then when I went back there in the afternoon on a Sunday the service was soooo slow and we had to correct the barista 5 times on what our order actually was.... Then the espresso was burnt. 

So I'd say it's a hit or miss with this location."}
{"text":"Crappiest Americano, I was given half a cup full and was told it was room for milk.  I said I didn't need that much \"room\" and she just went and filled it up with water.  It tasted like water.   Starbucks got way better ones, or better trained baristas I guess."}
{"text":"Spacious coffeeshop with very convenient hours and comfortable seating that is perfect for getting work done or whatever it is you actually do on your laptop. The wifi is free and  fast.  I also like the location in the busy Sainte-Catherine area downtown as it's in the heart of the shopping district. Great for people watching. The staff is cordial and the coffee is decent.  If you're visiting/leaving Montreal and need a place to kill some time, this Second Cup location is a good bet!"}
{"text":"Keeping it short and sweet (which is a representation of the amazing drink concoction the staff here introduced me to)  this new location in the booming Markham area is convenient and the comfortable.

While other major coffee chains are pushing to limit the amount of squatting coffee-shop workers, this location is encouraging it by providing a cozy environment filled with armchairs and a fire place. 

Not in the mood for a coffee on my last visit the staff insisted I try the wildberry cold tea with 2 pumps of raspberry flavours over ice. A little hesitant, I was surprised - tasted amazing!

Thanks team for making this spot a potential new Markham office location!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing you can relax grab a nice coffee and a tasty sandwich with dessert. Def beats Starbucks and Tim Horton's!  Oh and of course the FAST and complimentary WiFi is always reliable."}
{"text":"Usually what you would expect from a chain of coffee franchises: burned coffee and wrong orders.
Clearly not a good place for coffee in any format.
I got mine as a iced double espresso and almond milk. The after taste was horrible, it felt like I was licking the ashes of a pit fire. Burned as hell and the almond milk here in Montreal is awful in every single place. It tastes like carton, at least the local brands and the Pacifica which is the one that they used most of the time. They should start spending a little bit more in good non-dairy milk since they charge you a lot for it as well.
They made a couple of intents in doing my coffee and my wife's so not a great service neither.
This coffee shop is definitely out of my list!"}
{"text":"good coffee while you wait on line for a certain brunch spot a few stores down.
clean. Prompt service.
prices are reasonable.free wifi."}
{"text":"Really nice place to go on campus! My top priority coffee shop since I'm studying at York! I like the decorations here, it's cozy and comfortable to kill the time with friends or sit alone. More importantly, there's some good beverage, Green Mango Boost Smoothie, Vanilla, Flat White......."}
{"text":"Very nice place to catch up on studies or to hang out with friends. One of the best hot chocolate drinks I've tasted was from there! Be sure to add whipped cream. Nice staff too"}
{"text":"Came here again and it was definitely better than the first time I was here. 

The chillate I was given was a bit too sweet.  I believe there was espresso mixed with the drink not sure but it was hella too strong... 

The service was much better this time and seems friendlier than before.

Overall , possibly be back to try other stuff"}
{"text":"I never liked second cup until I started coming to this location! 

Everyone here is super friendly and awesome! 

I still don't go to other second cup because I am a Starbucks drinker but I always get drinks from here :)"}
{"text":"Agreed ... super friendly staff. Owner is very nice as well. Think this location has been there for 20+ years."}
{"text":"Very nice and comfy place to hangout with friends while drinking coffee. They are open late if not 24 hrs. It's one of the best places in the downtown area to work/hangout late nights."}
{"text":"I'm normally not a big fan of Second Cup, but the fact that a university campus coffee shop has a barista that can make latte art and a perfect flat white completely blows my mind. The management definitely knows about this because I only ever see him on the espresso machine while someone else is manning the till. The rest of the staff know their stuff and are very polite too. I had a different barista recommend that I try the cold brew even though I generally prefer hot drinks. Absolutely no regrets. The cold brew was pretty damn tasty!

Doors stay open when it's open. Very wheelchair accessible. It's a good study place for the night owl vibe but if you crave sunlight, get your drink to go."}
{"text":"Need better staff - Sejal was absolutely awful!!! I was called a \"complicated customer\". Do not name call your customer and have attitude. She could not reverse the full charge for medium lattes and use the coupon I had on my phone ($2.95 Wednesday). We waited 20 minutes for this to be corrected (not complimentary but charged).

We have spent between $1,200 and $1,500 a year at this location ordering our usual large 1/2 sweet vanilla lattes two or three times a week. After this experience with Sejal I don't think we'll return."}
{"text":"Pretty straight forward chain cafe not named Starbucks that's open 24hrs and has plenty of seating. Most of the seating is on somewhat of a mezzanine, and if you're lucky you can get a seat overlooking the bustling Cote Des Neiges. There's also a glass covered patio in the back which gets plenty of natural light during the day. The kind staff is a plus."}
{"text":"It's new years eve and not many stores are open just to chill and not being traped home, gladly this little coffee shop was open, service was good and fast, coffee and desserts average but is a good option if you just want to chill outside home in the cold."}
{"text":"Long line up served quickly.
Comfy seat.
Heavenly hot chocolate.
Wi-Fi hot spot.

Enough said."}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly staff, interesting snacks and desserts, gluten-free options. I love their flavored coffee, makes me feel like I'm eating a dessert without the calories. 

This place is always packed with students. Nice friendly staff that will keep you coming back for more. My go-to place for coffee on campus. Don't go to the Starbucks here, not as good."}
{"text":"Does it get any better than this location?

24 hours and chock full at every single one of them.
Choice McGill ghetto location right on Park and Milton.

An odd mix of people from all around the world.

The food and beverages are good, but it's all secondary to the atmosphere both inside and out.

The terrace is gigantic and very welcome during our short summer

Winter brings people inside,  the seating gets a bit harder but the ecosystem let's students and non-students get along very well."}
{"text":"My go to place. Regular coffees are better than Starbucks.  More balanced.  Try their Speciality blends: San Augustin, La Minita... for great flavor. Friendly staff. Good ambiance!"}
{"text":"Great spot in high traffic area of Montreal w plenty of seating inside to work. The seating is more expansive than many of the Starbucks here. The place is just cooler than Sbux aesthetically, too. Oh, and the coffee's great."}
{"text":"One of the larger Second Cup around.  Always tons of fresh goods.

Can get busy on Sundays where students come to study."}
{"text":"Favorate place  to go when I feel lonely.
Last time I finish the first 24 hours homework with my group here. After that it become my favorite place to go for a rest"}
{"text":"Great second cup location on Church and Welles with a big patio with umbrellas, and a big back interior with a lot of plugs.
Always friendly people working the counter.
Always great placed for people watching, getting together with friends and just doing some work.

I'm glad that they have this cafe space especially since the lettieri that used to be across the street is now a burger place- much better than the starbucks across the street."}
{"text":"This second cup is pretty remarkable.  If you're a regular you understand.

*Short review warning: Sometimes I write excessively short reviews because this place is either 1) A consistent 5-star shut out review (meaning not even a MINORITY will give it less than 5 stars), or 2) There is something so special about this place that it's worth GOING and not mulling about on yelp to decide if it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great place to study! Lots of places to sit, decent wifi, and good coffee. 

Tip: come dressed in layers, I'm always either too hot or too cold depending on where I'm sitting. I think this place has circulation problems due to all the windows."}
{"text":"Second cup to me is like Philz coffee back in the USA.

This, my Canadian Yelpers is a compliment.

Great smooth espresso, and good service.

I even enjoyed their Maple Latte made with the famous Canadian maple syrup.

Sweet and savory all in one.

Honestly, I'll take this place over Starbucks or Java U any day."}
{"text":"Good location. It looks great inside, super sleek. Wifi is good.

Just wish the view from the upstairs window was better, it just faces a wall."}
{"text":"Good patio, decent coffee, terrible music, boring people, worst WiFi in the city."}
{"text":"I loved Second Cup!  When I leave the US I vow to stay away from Starbucks and Second Cup made this not only possible, but quite enjoyable!  Prices are high (but everything is higher in Canada!), but the coffee is rich and the carrot cake here is fluffy and rich but not too sweet or heavy!  
Also, I can't forget to mention the free wifi access if you are a tourist that does't want to rack up roaming charges :)"}
{"text":"I had a bit of time on my hands and decided to roll up to a familliar place for a coffee and something sweet.  Its been a while since i was here last but its always enjoyable to grab a seat in a comfortable chair with my laptop and read the news with a coffee and a delicious brownie from Second Cup.  The staff is very friendly and always aims to please.  This is my go-to place for hanging out when i am in the area, so i guess i just arrived here on auto pilot today.  Its always a pleasure to hang out here."}
{"text":"My first time at Second Cup and  my friend and I both ordered the white hot chocolate - it was delicious!  I was super pleased with this selection!  The downfall, I paid with US dollars and somehow my bill of $7.64 CDN turned into almost $10. with the exchange rate!?!  Huh???  I inquired and was told that it was correct and that their registers are updated each day with the exchange rate and it is correct... I knew it couldnt be, so came back to the hotel and looked up the exchange rate - buyers beware if you are paying with USD and use your credit card instead, I didnt on this one transaction because it was so small, but lesson learned....."}
{"text":"The best gluten free chocolate Souffle sprinkle with edible gold is found here. This is an orgasm in your mouth. You'll come back for more."}
{"text":"Baristas here are friendly and usually remember your favourite order after a couple visits. The place itself gets pretty busy and at times it's hard to find parking. 
Coffee is always fresh and lattes made as per your request."}
{"text":"Small Second Cup in westmount - pretty standard stuff.  It's clean and service has always been good every time I've gone.  It doesn't have a lot of seating and every time I've gone I've ended up having to get take away as there was nowhere to sit.  In the summer they have a few chairs and tables outside and it's a nice place to sit and people watch."}
{"text":"Should be 3.5 stars. 

I'm somewhat surprised with the reviews saying it is a best place in town and giving it 3 stars...

Anyway, stopped there for breakfast - I guess it was a mistake, as while I was expecting all the sandwiches to be made on the spot, they were pre-made and only heated up. English muffin was very soggy after that heating up...
Coffee was ok, but not great - I have higher expectations for coffee in French Canada.
I guess it is a good place if you need WiFi and place to work, but I can't recommend it as a food place."}
{"text":"I always order the same iced caramel coffee from a Toronto location near my work and they always customize it to the way I like, half sweetened and extra ice. So I like to enjoy that same quality on my weekends but this location always makes it inconsistent, each barista there is not consistent on how they make their half sweetened resulting in either too sweet, too bland. One other nuisance is they always charge the wrong price and I always have to explain which is very unnecessary if only their staff gets trained well. I'm disappointed that I still always go back because it's 2 minutes away from my home. I will now go to the warden hwy 7 location a bit further down but hopefully better overall."}
{"text":"Samedi 17:00, reste pratiquement rien à manger dans le comptoir! Énormément de vaisselles et de verres sales traînent un peu partout...pas très invitant! Les toilettes sont malpropres. Une chance qu'il fait gros soleil sur la terrasse!"}
{"text":"This place is fancier than the usual second cups I have been to. Surely way cleaner, better chairs, better service, and better WiFi. Same menu though. Same mediocre overpriced coffee and sweets. I think Timmy's is tastier, cheaper, and even more Canadian eh?

I'm usually dragged here by someone. Personally this franchise is not my cup of coffee (pun intended). But if its yours then you probably gonna like this location."}
{"text":"I ordered the caramel latte/cappuccino which was a little bit sweet. The latte art was beautiful, and I appreciate that very much. Will definitely come back to try other coffees"}
{"text":"The staff makes me feel welcome every time I go there. Recently, I tried their strawberry banana glow smoothie for the first time.  It was thick and delicious with a whole banana thrown in!

Seating is comfortable and plentiful.  Tons of natural light is a bonus.

I always find the parking lot crowded.  As long as you don't mind a short walk, spaces are available.  Given the calorie count of their smoothies, parking at the other end of the lot may be a good idea."}
{"text":"Second Cup is the only chain coffee store where I never have a second thought about going to (get it?), as their coffee actually has decent flavour where it tastes like coffee (*cough* Tim Hortons - I don't want water + sugar) and isn't burnt (i.e. Starbucks).  Given that I work at Church and Bloor, my closest options are these two and Second Cup is either a 5 minute walk away or 10 minute walk away.  However, since last week was cool, I was strolling down from Bloor to Union and passed this Second Cup. It's definitely one of the nicer Second Cups I have seen (better than the one at Yonge/Charles) and they have a nice patio and a cool \"elevated\" seating area.  

So it seems like a great place to get work done, read a book or just relax and surf Yelp all day (lol).  Thumbs up to this Second Cup for being the #1 coffee chain in the area."}
{"text":"Perfect way to start the day. I love the smell of coffee so the shop's aroma is a nice wake up call before I get my cup of coffee. 

The service is quick which is great because most customers are on their way to class or work. However, if you go during a busy time, like 8AM, expect a line. Sometimes I stay here to catch up on my readings because there are many seats. The shop plays music but it's not too loud or distracting."}
{"text":"They finally opened the top floor! It's beautiful, spacious, and perfect to sit and get a bit of work/reading done. Before they had the upstairs area, it sucked to come here because it wasn't comfortable. I would just get my drink to go. Now it's great! 

I like this location, it has lots of food options and the wait is never long.
The staff has never messed up my order (I do order the same thing every time though) and they always smile when I visit.

Only downside is that if you stay too long you start smelling like coffee!"}
{"text":"Given the limited options on Nun's Island, I feel lucky that there even is a Second Cup. Because the Presse Cafe is bad and the Tim Hortons is a drive through. 

This location is still small in size and it doesn't feel like the kind of coffee shop that you could study comfortably in. It's busy and it's noisy. But they do have the frozen hot chocolate drink which is my favourite, so I can just get it to go and go sit somewhere else.

The staff is nice and the location is clean."}
{"text":"The newest chain coffee shop on Church (the other two are Starbucks and Timothy's). This one offers good coffee at lower prices than Starbucks. Better selection of baked goods and plenty of outdoor seating makes this a better choice during the summer or warm days. Located at the site of the former Zelda's restaurant (it has moved to a new location on Yonge Street since 2010), the coffeeshop is next door to a burger joint that opened up on the space. Yes it does add to the commercialization of a very bohemian street, but new a spot competing for coffee and tea lovers is always welcomed."}
{"text":"Very nice coffee, great ambiance . Interesting music, employees are very polite.worth to try the pastries ."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the coffee and food here.
She really enjoyed the decaf, I enjoyed the regular. 
We also enjoyed the falafel wrap they had.
We had breakfast there four days in a row (took sandwiches from other locations in as well)."}
{"text":"I know it's just a Second Cup but I really like this location.  I don't think it's worth going to this Second Cup just for coffee but if you're in Celebration Square, it's just a short little walk.  

This Second Cup is so roomy inside and has like 10-12 tables for their outside seating.  That's what I really like about this place.  Also, pretty good seating inside and of course I think Second Cup coffee is better than Starbucks."}
{"text":"Perfect coffee shop that is a chain yet still feels like an independent good quality coffee shop.

I was pleased to see they had a matcha latte so I ordered a small and we also ordered a regular latte.

We found a table easily and were served our coffee promptly. 

The matcha was delicious. Not too sweet yet it did have a hint of sweetness so it was easy to enjoy without having to purchase a sweet pastry.

The restaurant was nice and clean and the employees were very friendly. I asked for nonfat milk for my matcha and they made it the way I requested no problem.

There are lots of locations so we will definitely stop by this chain at least one more time before our trip is over!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is fantastic !!! 

Since opening a couple months ago I've been in a few times and honestly am not a big second cup fan (don't know why), their teas and coffees are very nice. 

All in all I'm sure I will be back many times !!"}
{"text":"It's such a nice spot for doing homework or writing thesis. I've been coming here for so many years now! Baristas are ultra nice too :)

I must admit that it's a bit pricey, but I like the atmosphere so much that I can't stop coming here."}
{"text":"Coffee is just for my taste (note that this is personal since it might not be your taste). Cheesecakes with strawberry or blueberries look great. A bit loudly environment thou especially on weekend days. Btw, staff is so friendly which is a big plus to me."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I was treated so poorly by the staff here. Coffee terrible too. I'd advise finding somewhere else!"}
{"text":"You may think this is just another Second Cup. And it is. On the inside... But on the outside lies a sprawling, semi-shaded patio PERFECT for summer reading or meeting up with friends. 

Additionally, I'm impressed with the iced tea here which was a nice surprise.

Free wi-fi. Clean washrooms. surrounded by other fun stuff. Full of the McGill crowd but not overwhelmingly so.

I'm taking off a star because, let's face it, Second Cup coffee is nothing to write home about, but as far as chain coffee shop treats, I think they have the best cakes and cookies and whatnot."}
{"text":"Solid service here and always clean. Keep them Chai frappes coming - Also if it's winter time their hot chocolate will definitely surprise you with their delicious syrup and chocolate flakes on top of their whipped cream. Yum"}
{"text":"Second Cup really makes me want to go back for seconds. I am wary of chain coffee shops, namely Starbucks. Nevertheless, Second Cup is the exception. It is laid out similarly to Starbucks but it is much more creative and has more variety of food and beverages. 

I had their mochachino with skim milk and it is made with dark chocolate and espresso. It is so rich I cannot even tell it is actually skim milk. My husband also got a cup of chocolate with mint latte and it is as good as it gets. 

People are hanging out in the cafe and they have a wide selection of sandwiches, cakes, and desserts. I wish I had a chance to return!"}
{"text":"Seems like this is a fast chain coffee shop like Starbucks. Decent tasting coffee but the wifi is atrocious."}
{"text":"I like second cup more than Starbucks. Their lattes are much more flavourful and there is more variety of pastries."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop as an alternative to Starbucks offering free wifi, a variety of coffee drinks and pastries, cookies, muffins, salads and sandwiches. Many tables to sit at to enjoy a coffee and snack.  Bathrooms are located in the basement and the women's was not very clean. The staff was friendly and provided service with a smile. The pastries we tried were very good and the flat white was perfect."}
{"text":"The best Second Cup location I have ever been to.
Staff is incredibly pleasant and always friendly whenever I come in. I am now a regular at this location because of their customer service and because they are always brewing a variety of blends. Other Second Cup locations i have been to sometimes only have 2-3 options, this one always offers at least 5-6 fresh brews.
They also never give me a hard time about spending time/studying there even when i've only ordered 1 drink the entire morning. Overall this Second Cup has been a great experience, I really recommend this location. (Spacious indoor and outdoor seating)"}
{"text":"This is the quintessential coffe place at York, where day and night you can find students crammed in here in their sweats studying for some exam or taking some time off to indulge in some cake.

It's a great location because everyone here is super nice.

Oh, and they take the York U card.

:)"}
{"text":"This place is the greatest, it has a very warm atmosphere, the service is the best I've seen in the area and the quality is really good. I love their hot chocolate and their red velvet! The only thing that is annoying is that in the winter this place is packed and sometimes you can't fins a place to sit!"}
{"text":"It's a good location, quiet and laptop-worker friendly.

I don't have too much to say here, only, I came for the free wifi (take that Starbucks!??) and will return again and again for their low-fat apple cranberry muffin.

Seriously -- I'm a low-fat muffin addict and was convinced that I'd never find a replacement for the low-fat blueberry raspberry muffins from Delanys in Vancouver but these ones blow 'em outta the water.

Big hunks of apple, a handful of cranberries (no, not strategically and sporadically placed like the ones in Starbucks' version) and when you bite into it, it's light and airy and tastes like it was made with more eggwhites than yolk.

I also went to another Second Cup in Markham and they had blueberry /raspberry ones. Equally amazing."}
{"text":"Downtown location is marvelous. Sitting outside near the park area and enjoying a great cup of coffee is memorable. The Danish and crossaints weren't that fresh but the coffee was good and strong. Most importantly is the great location albeit very busy...it's an experience."}
{"text":"I was never a big fan of Second Cup, but I do like this one.  It is very friendly.   They serve coffee to stay in a mug.  They have a very good selection of desserts and snacks.  I've tried a few and never disappointed.  

There are usually seats available.  Which is nice to have in today's coffee shops.  And there is ample parking.  

A very nice place to drop in, have a good mug of coffee and relax before heading home."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of second cup. But there's something about this building that I enjoy. My four-star rating is completely based on the feel of the room."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of this location. It's a little dirty. And when you're handeling food I expect more. If you can't scrub the front of house you're probably not cleaning the kitchen and food preparation area."}
{"text":"Products offered at this location are decent, however I was quite displeased with the service. The owner, Becky, was pleasant upon initial interaction but was too pushy during our visit, not only to our table but to other customers. She rudely and loudly asked a customer to leave for having one item of non-store bought food, rather than politely asking the customer to put away her outside food. In addition, she continued to push customers to purchase additional drinks/food items and circulated the facility too often, seemingly scouting tables that did not have enough purchased items. Perhaps this is my personal preferences, but I found the service lacking friendliness and overtly forcing customers to buy items, which was just too forceful in my opinion."}
{"text":"I came here several times while visiting Montreal because it was so close to where I was staying at the McGil residence halls. The abundant seating and free WiFi made it a great place to sit and journal or write emails. Great mochas and scrumptious pastries/baked goods!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located, free wifi, friendly and helpful staff and delicious desserts! Loved the cheesecake with raspberries (not a cooked cheesecake so it was apparently lighter than their other options, but it was deliciously creamy and I can only imagine how heavy and creamy their other cheesecakes must be!) and a lovely chocolate mousse tart. Absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, well-made espresso, and fresh pastries - you can't ask much more from a coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Honest opinion this place is great for locals,  as for the service it definitely sucks! My recent visit there were 3 associates they all just looked. Didn't even bother to serve any1 not like there busy. Only 1 associate actually cared to serve me. No customer service skills whatsoever, have definitely experienced much better service at other locations. Then again it's to be expected to be the same everywhere else, no common courtesy at all! their are a small percentage of people that do have common courtesy. it's common sense either you do or you don't, affordable coffee that tastes great. Wi-Fi by far the most stable web connection it's rogers. unlike Starbucks, Mcdonalds, which are powered by bell very unstable web connections."}
{"text":"Second Cup has a special going on Wednesdays in the month of March. So, before I head home after shopping around the area, I googled for the nearest Second Cup. Little did I realize that the location I found was right on the campus of York University. 

I parked my car by the wait area in the subway station as I wasn't sure where I could park. Thankfully, I had another person in the car with me so she stayed in the car while I went to get my drink.

This campus Second Cup is much different from what I expected. It is quite spacious with many tables as well as cozy-feel with a fireplace. If I were a university student again, I would definitely love to study here!

I ordered a medium London Fog and learned two things from the barista. First, I didn't need to load money on my Second Cup card to earn points. Second, I found that Second Cup makes their tea lattes with only milk, contrary to other places that make tea lattes with half milk and half water. 

Overall, this was an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"I love this Second Cup location. The staff are very friendly and kind! I love their service attentiveness to customers. Depending on the time of day... there may be some difficulty finding a seat but seat turnover is somewhat quick so be patient. I highly recommend downloading the Second Cup app!! They offer you a free drink for being a member for a year and one for every 500 points (10 points for every $1 spent). Loyalty programs rock!"}
{"text":"Very good Second Cup, with excellent, friendly service and abundant seating, indoors and out. Good selection of pastries and sandwiches. Open 24 hours. Always full of people using the wifi, large outdoor patio in summer."}
{"text":"Very friendly employees, and very cozy seating area. Great place to get work done on a cold day"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! Try their grilled sandwiches for lunch. You get a free coffee/tea with it. woot! :)"}
{"text":"Classic Second Cup coffee with friendly service.

Of course everyone knows what to expect when going into a chain coffee shop, so I won't bore you with those details. I mainly just wanted to point out that this place has great service and is kept very clean. Definitely a good place to grab a coffee with a friend or surf the net."}
{"text":"I've come to this Second Cup many times in my life and it's one of the best locations! The coffees are constantly good to great and the service is pretty awesome. There's a lot of young adults that come here and loiter around to study and chat. Wifi is free!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this location! It is so comfy. It is spacious and comfortable, nice to come if you plan to stay at a cafe for long. It is my one my favorite coffee shops in the area. However, if you are coming to do work with a laptop, there are not many seats by the outlets."}
{"text":"Pour un petit café ou un bon chocolat chaud avec une petite gâterie, c'est parfait. L'endroit est chaleureux et le service est rapide. Il y a des petits coins confortables et relaxants permettant la discussion ou simplement lire un bon livre."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience with Second cup! The customer service is worst. I ordered three drinks and three food, they got one of my coffee wrong and forgot to give me one of my order. I didn't ask them to redo it or anything. That's fine. But from the beginning to the end, I didn't see one single smile on the employees' face. They don't know their customers and they don't know service. I won't come back again and I'm also not sure about the brand now."}
{"text":"Stay away if you are the type of person who needs to ever visit washroom facilities.... this establishment locks their washroom in the evening, so even as a customer if you need to use the washroom they will not unlock the door for you. This is the personal experience encountered by four professional women in their 50's with functioning bladders. Their management staff and in particular Emma is the rudest and most arrogant and unprofessional staff person I have ever encountered in my life. While the others tried to be at least a little sympathetic and accommodating, Emma had major attitude and one wonders why this person is actually employed in customer service. Beats me...-By far the nastiest restaurant employee I have ever came across in my 50 plus years of visiting coffee shops and restaurants. Stay away from this location (ste. Catherine and Stanley street)if you actually have a functioning bladder."}
{"text":"Good coffee and pastries, rude AF cashier who had no patience for non French speakers. Terrible experience and after such a great day in Montreal."}
{"text":"I come to this Second Cup to work due to its convenient location and ample seating. Pieces by local artists are often on sale and displayed throughout the cafe, lending an air of sophistication to the space. It's usually not too loud. 

There are several things I wish would change: more plugs, friendlier service and better couches. Only one corner of the space has plugs available. When you walk in, don't be surprised to be greeted by a silent poker face. I'm not asking for a smile and a courtesy, but a \"Hi\" or \"I'll be with you in a minute\" would be nice. You know - manners. The couches are old, soft and way too low. Hello, lower back pain! 

Still, a decent place to work if you choose a good seat. Plus the drinks are nice."}
{"text":"J'apprécie cet endroit le matin pour son café expresso bien fort et les viennoiseries, le midi et le soir pour un repas léger et le soir tard pour me détendre après une journée bien chargée. 

Le WIFI gratuit est un gros plus, permettant de se connecter à Internet. Malheureusement, le nombre de places assises où on peut poser son ordinateur portable est limité. 

L'été les deux terrasses sont des endroits rêvés pour s'y détendre."}
{"text":"The frozen hot chocolate here is awesome awesome awesome.  Something about the Canadian whipped cream....it's just delicious.  They have a ton of seating and free wifi so it's a perfect place to relax after a long day of tourist walking.  I forgot the name of the drink since it's in French but it did have the word chocolate in it and it was on the right hand side of the menu.  

This is my first review out of the NYC five boroughs so you know it has to be good!"}
{"text":"I love second cup coffee specially the flavored once. I like specially this one as it has very nice seating area with great set up for doing work. I noted may people that come here and do work as well. I will recoment this place as it is big and if you do not mind the busy environment and the noise for doing work this is a good location and I will recoment it."}
{"text":"The first place I came to after a long flight to Montreal. Has good wifi, very spacious, a bathroom (cleanliness questionable), and great place to work or chat or charge up. I sat by the window and watched people walking around downtown :)"}
{"text":"First time in Montreal, so I decided to walk around the Downtown area...then, I decided to walk in this shop.  SO glad I did!!!  Just fell in love with this shop's coffee...they'll rival many of the shops back home in Dallas, Texas where I'm from.  :)"}
{"text":"Second Cup is the \"big bad Starbucks\" in Canada and just as plentiful!  There's one in almost every corner.

After trekking all day all over Montreal and withstanding the brisk Canadian cold weather, I came here to \"warm up\".  With my remedial French, I got myself a cup of hot coffee.  The taste reminds me of Starbucks: moderate bodied coffee with a slight hint of *burnt*.  The coffee varies slightly from store to store.  However it did the job and warmed me up that day (il pleuvait des chats et des chiens)!

The store was clean and orderly.  The baristas were very friendly and patient with English-speaking customers.  Reading materials were not sprawled all over the place but kept in organized bins.  

My first choice will always be Tim Horton's but I won't think twice about returning to Second Cup for my java fix!

Long café de phase !"}
{"text":"I like second cup and this place is always busy. Very friendly staff with very good service. I love their coffee and cakes."}
{"text":"This Second Cup is....meh. It's almost ALWAYS packed (as in, can't find a single seat packed!) as there is a college and a mall nearby. There are only 2 outlets in the entire coffee shop, so make sure your gadgets are charged before heading here. The employees always seem tired and worn out, so I don't really get a smile or a hello when entering. All the college students always make this place extremely loud, so it's not exactly a place to have a coffee and get some work done. The wifi is spotty!

This is the location closest to my place in Canada, so that's why I keep coming here even though I'm apathetic towards it. The coffee is mediocre at best (Tim Hortons is way better!) and the service is drab. Try out a different coffee place if you're looking for a nice atmosphere and good coffee!"}
{"text":"By far my favourite place to study. I love the ambiance because it's super clean and calming. It's not loud and the people who work there are amazing. They really do put effort in keeping the place clean. It's a bit more packed in the weekend so go early and save your seat."}
{"text":"Can get a bit loud- however cake portion sizes are really good. They open late which is a plus (closes at 12:00 am). 

Not that many open seats during the weekday during the day- a lot of people come and go. However, weekend and night time is empty with more space.

Baristas are really cool and chill. A really big applause to them because there's always lines and a lot of flow of people."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this review is biased because this is the ONLY Second Cup that I have patronized over the last two years or so.

The coffee is no brainer good.  I once bought their ground coffee and brewed coffee at home.  The coffee was very good.  But the 5 stars are granted for everything else:

1) new, nice store
2) high speed and dependable internet
3) they line certain sofa corners with multi-outlet extension bars.  True laptop warriors heaven, if you can score a sofa, that is.
4) Rotating variety of La Rocca cakes at reasonable price.  If I recall it correctly, it is $5 for a generous slice
5) the staff are friendly, fast and effective.  And they don't bug you even if you hog a sofa for hours.
6) it is conveniently located, and there is ample parking
7) open late at night

So here is my routine.  I feel like something sweet after dinner, or much later such as close to 10pm.  I come here to have a coffee and share a slice of cake with BF.  Together we have had red velvet cake (very highly recommend), cheese cake, almond cake, tiramisu, brownie, chocolate cake, etc.  They are all good.  The portion is perfect for sharing.  Pay this Second Cup a visit when you feel like a slice of cake next time."}
{"text":"I'm adding a star because they've extended business hours by a little bit - Sun-Thurs to 11PM and Fri & Sat to Midnight. It's only an extra hour but the past couple of years have seen an epidemic of ever shortening business hours in food & hospitality,it's really hard to get better coffee or espresso at 10PM for people with later schedules so I appreciate this very much even though I'm not around here that often.  

Plus this location has at least 2 people working every time I come here, and thankfully no driv-thru (so no standing around being ignored 5 minutes while one person multitasks between prep & drive-thru...). Traffic & parking on Church is a hassle but so is the Starbucks at Yonge & College. I can see myself making a 7km detour a 2-3 times a month just to get my late coffee fix here."}
{"text":"This location has the best customer service ever!!! I enjoy grabbing my coffee on my way to work everyday.. Very sweet team!"}
{"text":"Second Cup, un autre de ces fameux cafés à l'américaine, et en compétition constante avec le plus connu de tous: Starbucks ! 
Celui-ci à l'avantage d'être ouvert 24/24h, plus tôt sympa en période d'examen. 
Concernant le décor, ça n' a rien de bien exceptionnel, c'est assez basique, de simples petites tables et chaises ou larges fauteuils plutôt confo ! Toutefois il dispose d'une belle grande véranda, j'aime beaucoup y boire un bon chocolat chaud en hiver lorsque la neige couvre la toiture! 
Concernant leur produits, honnêtement je trouve ça cher pour ce que c'est ! Leurs frappés, personnellement je préfère ceux du starbucks, en plus, la dernière fois que je m'y suis rendue, il ne m'ont même pas proposé de crème fraîche et ça c'est vraiment précieux pour moi ! Et payer plus de 5$ (le petit format) pour de l'eau glacée et de l'extrait d'expresso, bof ! 
Leurs sandwichs donnent envie mais niveau goût c'est pas top ! Puis ils font des mixtes assez bizarres! 
Ils ont également toutes sortes de sucreries évidemment, biens lourdes, bien grasses, à l'américaine quoi (mais je reconnais, de temps en temps, je craque et c'est pas dégueu) 

En gros, c'est pas mal, c'est sympa pour prendre un café ou autres entre amis mais ça reste très industriel !"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! All were very friendly and it was very clean there; no complaints."}
{"text":"Cafe opened 24/7 in Downtown Montreal.  Free Wi-Fi!! 

Great place to stop by for some coffee, espresso, lattes, whatever you may fancy. 
Free Wi-fi available so you can share your check in on Yelp and facebook. 
Lots of seating inside and a few outdoors.  

Made this a quick pit stop during the bachelor party trip.  Beats the starbucks next door which was closed at 12am."}
{"text":"Love the decor.  The service and coffee was good."}
{"text":"I love this second cup. By far one of the nicest little coffee places I've been to here. Love the Chai latte with the biscotti. Great selection. (Same as a regular second cup I agree but the ambience makes it so much nicer!)

The staff is super an there is a fireplace.... Seriously this is def one of the more cozy and nicer places to have a coffee."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Second Cup I've ever been to - consistently a winner. BUT - there is always a but - the wireless sucks pretty badly. Connection drops several times per hour.

They fix that and I'll give it even more than five stars."}
{"text":"Having only been to two other Second Cup locations I don't have very much to base this review on, but from what I experienced, and comparing it to my other experiences on campus located restaurants, this place isn't bad at all. 

The staff are all very nice and polite and are willing to answer any questions you may have about any menu offerings. Although I personally don't really like Second Cup that much their products are still very good and are definitely better than Tim Hortons; so if you're looking for a  change from the regular, this is your place."}
{"text":"Very solid espresso and baked goods with comfortable wood seating in a prime location.  Open 24 hours as well!  Great for a late night stop and/or catch-up with friends.  And maybe a good place to cram pre-exams, as well."}
{"text":"Bon ca reste une chaine donc je ne vais pas vous faire une présentation de leur café mais ce second cup est pas mal du tout intérieurement.

J'ai beaucoup apprécié l'accueil et au final leur café n'est pas si mauvais pour une chaine."}
{"text":"I am fine with second cup in general. I wouldn't study at this place because with the music and the talking around me, it can get loud and it is hard to study.

The wifi at the second floor on the back where the garden is at dont work. The tables are not cleaned and the areas are not well lit. 

Overall, I am disastisfied of this second cup. The location of this place is ideal for students. Maybe the summer month is ideal to come and study.  In cold october days, it is a dark and gloomy place to study."}
{"text":"Ok, I mean...its a chain. Kind of like Starbucks. I've had tea and iced tea here and wasn't disappointed by the product or service. 

Not really much else to say I guess."}
{"text":"This place means business, strong smell of roasted coffee in the air, people eating late night snacks, a great selection of anything java or non java to tempt your senses!"}
{"text":"Customer service was extremely rude. Jasmine, the employee, failed on several accounts to execute on the following:
- accurately fulfilling order for 1 (one) simple drink
- proper customer service and appropriate attitude, extremely rude to my wife and I

All in all, as a frequent visitor to Second Cup, I'm extremely disappointed that this establishment hires such unprofessional individuals. As long as Jasmine works here I'll be going to Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"The sweetest older couple own and operate this Second Cup. I am often there on work from home days or over the weekend. The place is always spotless and service is excellent. Nice seating area with a fireplace too."}
{"text":"Love the coffee and quick grabs. Came here yesterday and am back again. 

They have a variety of quickies to choose from. From sandwiches to pastries and of course amazing coffee. 

Definitely recommended! Come here, sit down, chat and enjoy ur evening!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place in 2007 when I was in my second year undergraduate at McGill. Specialty coffees are overpriced, no doubt, but you're paying for the atmosphere and the wi-fi and the nice smoking/terrasse area in the summertime. It was a good place to study for mid-terms and finals when the library got too boring. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Right around the corner from my building, this is an ideal location for students in the \"student ghetto\" as it is affectionately called. It is open all day and all night and is a great place to study for that exam tomorrow morning or write a paper due in a few hours. You will always see students in there with coffee, a laptop and a book. The inner ambiance is comfortable, with ideal spaces for relaxing or working."}
{"text":"I really like the coffee chain.  The staff is polite and friendly!  This location was perfect since I was doing laundry next door.  An interesting array of characters inside.  They have a nice patio area in front.  Nice crispy croissant!  Definitely popular with people in the neighborhood.  I'd come back, if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Wandering around some of the neighborhoods, I was running low on energy and needed a caffeine fix.  Second Cup appears to be the Canadian equivalent to Starbucks.  I refuse to go to a Starbucks in any other foreign country.  This location is great!  They have a large patio in front, but it was a little warm, so inside with AC was perfect.  The barista made the best foam for my cappuccino and had one of the tastiest macaroons I've ever had.

Definitely worth a visit.  I'm sure when it's busy, it's a madhouse!"}
{"text":"Great coffee!  I ordered a skinny cafe latte and it was delicious!  The bagels are fresh as well."}
{"text":"You want coffee? They sell it. You're hungry? They can make it. A bit pricey but it's worth a quite bite and coffee if you're on the run."}
{"text":"This is actually a nice Second Cup, just on the outskirts of Square One, at the bottom on one of the condos.  

There is surprisingly plenty of seating that's tucked around back of the front counter.  It was completely full on Family Day.  People on their laptops, so you know that they'll be there...for a while!

The downfall on this location is that it's either street parking - there are a few spots where you can park 30mins for free - or you hafta pull into the parking garage around the side. 

I parked just alongside the café and I accidentally drove through the parking garage, but I do not know the policy.  I'm sure there's free parking for the retail, but only limited number of spots available."}
{"text":"I'm no coffee drinker so I'll keep this short. We dropped in for dessert and to kill time before the movie. Very nice and clean place, the coffee-chocolate mousse I had was awesome, as was the hot chocolate. According to my girlfriend, the coffee is very good also. The Laptopistan jokes  Bourdain makes about coffee shops are on the money but who cares if everyone is happy."}
{"text":"Terrible company. no wonder they are having financial problems!!! They do not return calls at the head office in Mississauga, they do not answer emails either.
What way is that to run a business??

As a long term customer I am thinking of taking all my clientele and friends and family to Starbucks that has the best customer service in the world hence their world presence. Get with it Second Cup Canada.You are failing !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I liked this second cup. Lovely, cute place to sit down for a coffee and the staff is very nice!"}
{"text":"Delicious cup of freshly made coffee. Charming service. I feel at home here while visiting."}
{"text":"Conveniently located.
Recently renovated.
Very fast service, someone takes your order while you are still in line so when you get @ cashier your drink is ready!!

Love their matcha tea latte!
Wifi is free but sometimes bugs.."}
{"text":"Plenty of room, very good WiFi coverage even outside, and friendly staff. Definitely a good place for a very late night coffee or your morning cup."}
{"text":"A Second Cup much like any other.  Always good and clean.  The food selection is always full which is nice. The staff here are very good and friendly.  Wish I had more to say but ultimately,  Second Cup is Second Cup."}
{"text":"Great central location (right next to Reuben's), open 24 hours, free Wifi, huge seating area...what else could you ask for in a coffee shop?

Well, good coffee I suppose.  The bold tastes like old coffee to me.  I am not coffee aristocrat, so don't jump down my throat.  I suggest the flavor of the day for you \"I only want to look cool while getting caffeine\" drinkers."}
{"text":"had a cup of regular coffee. It was so bad, I had to throw it out. I should have returned it. I think it's due to the new barista, must be her first day, she did not seem like she knows how to brew a cup of coffee at all."}
{"text":"Café situé sur la rue Ste Catherine, près du métro Peel. Il est ouvert 24h sur 24 ce qui fort pratique pour les gens qui sortent de club ou pour les clients d'hôtels qui souhaitent prendre un petit déjeuner léger tôt (les hôtels commençant le service habituellement vers 6am). L'endroit dispose de plusieurs tables, pratique pour les groupes ou les étudiants. Je recommande de ne pas prendre les options salés comme les sandwich, ils sont dispendieux et pas si bon. Le pain n'est pas très frais. Toutefois, les desserts et viennoiseries sont de bonnes options. J'adore les tartelettes aux amandes et fruits (bleuets, framboise) ainsi que leurs tartes et cheesecake. Le service est très rapide et courtois surtout pour un endroit aussi achalandé c'est surprenant. Les employés demeurent toujours souriant."}
{"text":"Being on St. Catherine, this location is always going to be packed and noisy. They have a decent selection of sandwiches if you need more than java, but the bacon, egg and cheese muffin tasted like something you'd get out of the freezer section and microwave at home. Not exactly worth $3.75 plus tax."}
{"text":"I always think of Second Cup as a slightly Canadian Starbucks. It's just about the same, except their iced lattes have a bit more of an espresso punch to them.

Nothing special about this location. If there's even a hint of sunshine, the outdoor patio will be packed with singles doing work or reading."}
{"text":"New favorite coffee place! They rival Peets in California and Dutch Bros. in Portland, and that is saying something! Super smooth frapps and delicious honey milk tea (which I have only ever been able to find in boba shops). Highly recommend this place, its totally worth the price, and honestly its not much more than nasty old Starbucks.

However, this particular location it's pretty packed and busty."}
{"text":"This was a good experience, but the coffee experience didn't blow us away. 
The space was really pretty, airy, and open and the service was friendly and very helpful.

My boyfriend ordered a black coffee and I ordered a latte. Both were so-so. The black coffee honestly tasted like it had been brewed too long and was super bitter.

The experience was good - a great place to meet someone for a cup of coffee - but don't expect it to blow you away."}
{"text":"This second cup location is one of my favourites. While it doesn't have a ton of indoor seating I can usually still get a seat. They have a very nice terrace in the summertime as well. It is very clean, the pastries are always fresh and the coffee is always very well made. The staff is also very friendly and efficient. There are very limited coffee shop options on nuns island so I am very happy to have this second cup available to me."}
{"text":"A cozy cafe experience right in the heart of Plateau Mont Royal.

I had the Sparking Green Tea Lemonade, which hit the spot on a hot summer day. I paired it with a slice of Lemon cake, which was kind of like a lemony pound cake. It did the job.

The only thing I would say is that the Wifi was unbearably slow. Like under 1 mbps slow. It would do for minor browsing or emailing, but forget anything else."}
{"text":"Coffee is decent. You can download their app and collect points to earn a free drink (similar to starbucks). Lots of students studying here or ppl with their laptops so its hard to find a seat. The location is big but there isnt many plugs for your computer. Wifi is weak compare to Starbucks. Their peanut butter chocolate chip cookie was really good tho ($2.25)."}
{"text":"This second cup is spacious and has a variety of seating spaces and arrangements to accommodate different group scenarios. The coffee is okay, but if there is anything worth a try on the menu it is the flavoured lattes. Please do not spend money on the food, unless you really need something sweet to go with your coffee, as many of their items are over priced and bland. In the end, it is another coffee franchise."}
{"text":"Clean environment, friendly staff and yummy hot chocolate! 

I used to study here back in the day and it was the best spot to do so!"}
{"text":"Best second cup location ever! Open 24/7 and in a fun district!! Great service and run wonderfully!!!"}
{"text":"Voilà une chaine de café qui, sans être exceptionnelle, reste appréciable. Généralement leurs locaux sont confortables et chaleureux et le personnel accueillant. 
Je recommande particulièrement le latté vanille au lait d'amande. Et les tarifs sont corrects."}
{"text":"This place is super cute!!! We stopped by because we stayed close to here when we visited Montreal and we needed some caffeine. It's on Saint Catherine St. so it's in a very busy location. Even though there were a lot of customers, the line still moved really fast.

The layout of the place is super inviting and it's just a nice place to grab a drink and chill. I like that there were plenty of seating all throughout the place.

I had the vanilla bean latte and it was pretty good. Not too sweet, yet still tasted like vanilla bean. 

It's funny that French seems to be the primary language here, but the baristas can easily switch back to English to take your order! 

Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Good coffee but the friendly staff that used to work here all seem to have left.

The patio is always crowded in the summer. 

About this company:
They now have an app and rewards program, which is something, though the rewards program is not as generous as sbux'."}
{"text":"Not review for this location.

The bathroom was so gross and small. GROSSSSSS! I thought I would give local coffee a support. Too disappointed!"}
{"text":"Second stop on my first night in Montreal (but First Cup. ha ha).  I didn't realize it was a chain coffee shop, until later in my trip - but nonetheless, this is a lovely place for a cup of nice espresso and fantastic selection of pastries (and cheesecake galore).  

I figured hey.. let's go for a cappuccino, although typically I'd run for a latte.  Maybe I thought a cappuccino was more French, in my sleeplessness from the travels.  Anytime after 2pm, and it'll be decaf.  Yeah, blasphemous, but I don't like to please the insomniac in me.  I asked if the pastries are made there, and he said no.  But there were a bunch of these mini loaf cakes in a jar up front.  They looked perfect and cozy.  \"Almond shortcake\"...  sold.  

Let me tell you, it was one of the best desserts I've had.  Barely sweet, very buttery, and moist as can be.  My kind of dessert.  I almost went back on my final day to pick up a bag of just these.  

Prices are reasonable, and probably $6-7 (I forget exactly).  Great seating up front to catch the view of passers by, heading to and away from Crescent St.

Although it's a chain, I think it's limited to Canada.  Not sure.  If you want a decaf that doesn't taste decaf, and a nice selection of something sweet that isn't necessarily homemade but still quite yummy, give it a try."}
{"text":"Lots of seating near natural light and windows. Noise level low so you can study or focus on work. First time I tried their London Fog Tea Latte, it's pretty good!
Con: their second floor has no lighting, it makes it quite dark even during daytime.. invest in some lighting"}
{"text":"no plugs for the laptop, plenty of tables, loud music, not so good for studying if you get distracted easily"}
{"text":"I'm that person who camps out at the coffee shop for 4, 6 hours at a time behind my computer. So this cafe fills a few important niches: 
1) copious seating. You can sit in cozy chairs, or at a table, or at the bar. 
2) wifi - endlessly. It refreshes every 2 hours, but just keeps on coming.
3) caffeine. I only get the coffee. It's decent. Pastries are really lacking.
4) lots of power outlets. Like tons. It's great.

Some extra bonuses - interesting artwork on the walls (changes occasionally), a big outdoor patio in nicer weather, and convenient location. Good for me."}
{"text":"I had hoped to make this 'my shop' since it's a stone throw away from my place but I have to admit I don't like this location at all.

It's dark and dingy, often understaffed, the wifi connection drops a lot, and most seats don't have an outlet in sight which makes for limited seating options for laptop users. I also agree with previous reviews- this place is not clean and with school being back in (there are two within the block), this may get worse before it gets better. 

I think I'll be looking for a nicer coffee shop to call my own. Bookmarking some as we speak. Besides, they don't have 
 my favourite snacks here, but the barrista made me decent drinks so that's a plus.

I RECOMMEND- the red velvet cake with a white hot chocolate, just enough sugar to power through whatever assignment brings you in. 

EXTRA TIP- Charge your laptops. Like I said... I've spotted two outlets max in the place."}
{"text":"This Second Cup is located at Bathurst and Rutherford... in the same plaza where you can get Aroma Espresso or Starbucks!

A big note saying 1 Hour limit for seating..It is the only coffee place I been to that posted a time limit, I wondering if they would enforce it or not.. but when I was there, the place was half empty.. so should not be an issue.

Nice armchair area makes it feel like you are enjoying your coffee at someone living room.

I like how Second Cup usually have more than 1 kind of drip coffee... their espresso products I found they are just meh.

Free Wifi."}
{"text":"Welcome to the NEW Second Cup!

Craft Coffee Bar? Pour Over? Steampunk? Espresso?

Phone Charging Station?

A Barista that knows about Coffee Profile and can do a decent pourover? 

I just love the new concept."}
{"text":"Opens 24 hours

Free Wifi with tons of outlet

Plenty of seating

Even a covered patio with outlet...

Laptop heaven!

I ended up having an afternoon nap here while my friend using Yelp App to find out where we would be having dinner!"}
{"text":"Brand new Second Cup!!!

It is only opened last Wednesday and I could not even find a listing on their corporate site!

Spacious and Roomy and just love those armchairs right next to the 2 sided fireplace, kind of cozy and feel like home?

Limited outlets so make sure your laptops are charged up!

Super friendly staffs!

Now this Second Cup is the go place as my Yelp office or  if I want to chill out and meet up with friends!!"}
{"text":"Les viénoiseries sont très bonnes et assez consistantes comme la tartelette aux framboises. Sinon pour un \"petit\" matcha latte, je n'en ai jamais bu un d'aussi caféiné, sucré, gigantesque et au goût aussi cheap. Le matcha doit être de qualité la plus basse je pense = matcha pour cuisiner. En ayant pris ça à 5h pm, en soirée je me suis senti mal et ai fait une insomnie jusqu'à 4h30 am. L'endroit dispose de beaucoup de tables notamment d'une belle verranda à l'arrière donnant sur un espace dégagé dont une vue sur l'oratoire St Joseph. Idéal pour y rencontrer des amis. Beaucoup trop bondé pour une date par contre car l'endroit est envahit d'étudiants avides de Wi-Fi et de caféine et je ne comprendrai jamais comment ils arrivent à se concentrer dans un tel environnement. Je mettrais plutôt un 3.5/5 mais bon : ). En terme de boissons, je préfère largement la qualité à la quantité. Second Cup c'est vraiment le format US. Tout est dans la taille (et peut être malheureusement que dans ça)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town for a great cup of coffee and working. Internet speed is great. Although busy but not too distracting for work. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Desserts are awesome."}
{"text":"It is nice place to chill. It is located in the strip mall, with Whole Foods, Panera Bread, bank... Credit cards or cash( Canadian $) they have a lots of nice apartments and still building more so I'm sure it will get busier days goes by."}
{"text":"Cute little place to get iced coffee near my hotel. Friendly employees. 

My only complaints were no Equal (sugar or sweet n lo only) and no fresh fruit!"}
{"text":"This is one or my favourite study locations. It'd quiet , the service is great and the WiFi is strong.  I sometimes swing by to grab a tea and coffee to go. If you seek a quiet place to read a newspaper as well as  get emails sent off this is one of the nice places to do it at. 
I sometimes try out new pastries  as well since foodies must try what's new ."}
{"text":"Just enjoying my second cup. . . at Second Cup! 

Yup, the coffee here is damn good. I like how they have 4 or 5 different roasts to choose from rather than only 3 *cough* Starbucks *cough* *cough* This particular location, I must say, is very nice. The inside has probably the comfiest seating I've ever seen at a coffee shop. They even have a fire place AND a patio! As I write this review on my mobile phone, I am witnessing them cleaning the patio tables, so that's a plus. In fact this whole place is really clean (including the spacious washrooms). 

I really like the inside decor. It has low tones with a nice coffee bean brown theme going on. Actually really cozy. It's nice and quiet here as well. If I were a student near by, I would definitely come here to study or at least bring my gurl for a nice coffee date ;) 

Overall, love this place. I would definitely come back! The only downside is their not so great wifi but at least it works. 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"I used to love this second cup but they changed management last year and it seems a bit less clean and less friendly than it was a few years ago. This spot can get pretty crowded with a lot of people doing work for quite a bit of time. Outlets are by the walls in the corner."}
{"text":"I am a supporter of Canadian businesses all the time.  

Second Cup has great coffee with my favourite blend Paradiso.  Best mixed coffee is Vanilla Bean Latte with soy and half the sugar.  

The only reason why I didnt give this particular location a full score is because the service and consistency.  The baristas are not very friendly and everytime I go and get a coffee the barista is talking to another barista and than leads to me wait to order and pay.  This happened more than once.  The inconsistency is the quality of my mixed coffee is up and down.  I gotten my VBL with no froth once and asked the barista what happened and she said its suppose to be that way.  All latte drinkers know its the froth that round up a latte.  I have also gotten a burnt brew of Paradiso.  The service is mediocre and the quality of my coffees are not consistent.  I will still go, just not that often."}
{"text":"I'm a big Second Cup fan but this one is the worst location in the area (this is a legitimate thing. Ive heard this from people who work at the Second Cups nearby). They hardly have any baked goods, mess up drink orders, and the staff aren't friendly but I used to be a loyal customer since 1. it's the only cafe close by and 2. there's always a place to sit (hardly anyone comes in). 

However I will NOT be returning as I've begun to feel uncomfortable. 

Ive notice the owner will consistently stare at every female who walks in. This has even been mentioned to me numerous times by others. 

On my last visit he randomly came up to me and began questioning me. He was accusing me of sitting in the store without buying anything when I've been sitting with my drink right on my table. As if I'm just taking up their space and stealing their wifi?? There's only four people in the store and you've definitely seen me in here before.

I will not be supporting this store again."}
{"text":"Best place to chill out, to have an ice tea, listen to music and have a comfortable spot. There is always a bunch of people at this prime location. Everyone is friendly, English, French, every different nationality, such a mix of diversity. 
Love this place"}
{"text":"I love this second cup. They are very accommodating and if you would like a specific flavour of brewed coffee they will do it for you (you just have to wait). I love the Irish cream flavour, and would recommended it! They also have soya and almond milk which is a bonus! They recently have added pinkberry frozen yogurt - but I cannot review on that since I didn't try anything from them. It's a great cozy location with some comfy chairs and it's a great meet up spot with plenty tables to choose from!"}
{"text":"They got our order wrong even though we repeated it back to them twice. And after they made us the wrong drink they were so rude about changing it. They didn't apologize or make up for it in any way. We only stopped at this location because it was the closest but we would not be in a rush to visit again."}
{"text":"I mean, it's Second Cup. Can we all admit it's our 2nd or 3rd option after seeing Starbucks is packed, or all the good coffee shops are closed, or you simply need a place with WiFi to cram before exams the next morning. What more can I say?

Let us praise however whoever at SC HQ decided to bless us with the Apple Baba, that strange--are we entirely sure that's an actual dessert?--concoction of not-all-the-way-baked dough, cinnamon apple powdered sugar yumminess. 

Apple Babas are the bomb."}
{"text":"It only took me 3 years to find out that this place was walking distance from my home! Once it was found it quickly became a favourite.  The staff knows what I usually get and they are always friendly and welcome me with a smile.  

The staff is very knowledgeable of the coffees and different variations of it.  They are always able to suggest something nice to try. 

I like this place because it's close and Canadian-owned."}
{"text":"Got the caramel latte. A bit on the pricey side but very good cup. Servers are polite."}
{"text":"When I have the choice to pick between a coffee shop with a terrace or one without, I always go for the terrace. During a sunny day, this location is perfect. 

I used to go a lot to the Second cup located on Parc Avenue. They had one of the nicest and biggest terrace located in the heart of Mtl. That location closed.

Coming back to the one located on IDS, overall it is not bad.

The pastry at second cup is above average compared to the other coffee shops out there. This means that I do recommend it.
I've tried the Fudge brownie. It is sweet, soft and very chocolaty. Some say that this is how grandma used to make them.
I also tried the chocolate cake. It is fluffy from the inside with chocolate layers. This combination makes it less sweet than the brownies."}
{"text":"Decent enough coffee shop with friendly staff and plenty of room.  Fairly tidy and ok food.  Not much sets it apart from the other big chains.  No complaints either though."}
{"text":"Total Starbucks rip off!  This place feels very generic and soulless.  However, on a cold snowy night, it totally hits the spot.  After doing some shopping on this street we wandered in here for a warm up.  My latte was decent but the star menu item was the candy cane white hot chocolate!  So good!  Just a hint of peppermint...  The white hot chocolate was amazing and we bought a canister to go.  

The girl working was interesting...I'll leave it at that.  Overall, we all really enjoyed our small break from the cold here!"}
{"text":"3.5. I've been a couple of times and it's usually pretty empty which is nice, you can always find a seat!!

Location: 
Bathurst and Rutherford on the Vaughan side. It's tucked in the corner. You won't stumble upon it, y'all need to go there on purpose.

Parking :
Depending when you come it can be ok or tough to fine. That being said, a few minute walk will get you a lot of parking.

Decor:
Typical second cup. Tables, booth table hybrid, comfy arm chairs.... there's also a pretty fake fireplace to sit in front of. It's a nice location.

Food:
Typical second cup.
My last visit I tried the strawberry banana smoothly it was delicious. I also got the freezer brownie. Was also tasty but I broke the plastic knife trying to get through it.

Staff:
Nice but the times I've gone there's only been one person working and it is super slow. But second cup tends to be a place where you sit and stay a while so it's all cool.

It's a good location. Great place to sit and chat"}
{"text":"Nothing super special about this place.  Good coffee and decent sandwiches (especially after a long night of drinking. 

It's gets 4 stars for two reasons:

1. Free WiFI
2. Open 24/7."}
