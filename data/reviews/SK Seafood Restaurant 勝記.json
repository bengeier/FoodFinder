{"text":"Overpriced for average food...you can easily find better alternatives within 5 minutes drive from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, I don't know where all these 5 stars come from. Chinese visitors come here, and the worst Chinese food I ever had."}
{"text":"Food and service are really good! They're fairly new, so the place was not too packed when I came in. Food came out pretty quick, and you could tell that the ingredients were fresh. I'll probably be coming here as opposed to places like KJ Kitchen and HK Star nearby! 

Parking is kind of limited, but we didn't have a problem parking when we went. 4 stars because some of the dishes we got were on the expensive side for the amount of food we got, but like I said, I'll be coming back and trying their take on other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here at night after watching a show. The place is clean and we were seated right away by the friendly hostess. She offered us cold water as well as complimentary hot tea. There was complimentary soup for dinner, very nice touch on a cold February night. We ordered salt pepper chops, shrimp with salty yolk, seafood pan fried noodles and eggplant with garlic. They were all presented beautifully and all were very good. The pork chop was lean and tender and crispy with just the perfect amount of garlic and chilies. The shrimps were fresh and crispy. The rest of the food were delicious. The hostess and server kept checking on us if there's anything we need and recommended their specials like lobsters and other seafood which we would like to try when we go back. We finished the meal with my favorite warm red bean dessert (a plus that it's free after dinner). 
Price is very reasonable. A lot of food, about $45 for all of above. The service is prompt, personalized and attentive and staff is very friendly and efficient. And yes, this is an authentic Chinese place!
Overall highly recommended. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Very clean. Efficient waiters. There were 2 manning the front and back but they moved quickly. Our food was out in no time. 

The salted shrimp was delicious; the lamb dish was very good. We had another chicken dish which was okay- forgot the name. My family thoroughly enjoyed the food. Really tasty!! Very authentic! Highly recommend and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food and the service was fast! We had the lufa, home made fish balls, pork ribs with honey glaze, filet mignon. It was all delicious! If you go during dinner time you get free soup, free tea and free dessert"}
{"text":"Vacationing from out of town. Food is very good and authentic. I wanted try few dishes that I have never tried before. Our waiter was very nice and very attentive. Will def eat again if ever in town."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch and was very satisfied with the food. Ordered half crispy fried chicken, singaporean noodle and sauteed string beans, everything came out in generous portions and still was able to take some of it home."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese foods I ever have in Las Vegas. It has seafood and good lunch special with amazing prices. I will definitely go back there again. I like the steam Pearl clam in soy sauce with only 9.99 dollars!"}
{"text":"I rarely give Chinese restaurants five stars, because I have high expectations. To call this restaurant a pleasant surprise is a vast understatement of my family's experience here. We randomly happened across it on a Sunday night when our original dinner plans fell through. Judging from the other Yelp reviews, it just newly opened about half a year ago. Place is bright and clean, and the decor feels very appropriate and comfy. The tables were about half full and all the patrons were speaking either Mandarin or Cantonese, which is always a good indication of the authenticity. Service was excellent and they immediately brought out hot tea for us when we sat down.

Now onto the food: you get complimentary soup, which was a very earthy, rich duck broth with all sorts of lotus and root vegetables in it - very enjoyable. All of our dishes came out fresh, hot, and delicious! They even managed to meet my mother's exacting standards. Expect the menu to have a good variety of traditional Cantonese food, ranging from noodles to stir-fry, with a good array of vegetables and seafood to choose from. My favorite was the green beans, sauteed with pork and some peppers to give it a kick. Portions are very generous and refills on white rice and tea are constantly available. As an added bonus, at the end of the meal you are also automatically treated to a delicious taro sago (tapioca) dessert soup, which hit every single one of my \"childhood nostalgia\" buttons. ::happy sigh::

Definitely plan to come back to try more of their dishes. And thanks to all the staff for their attentive and gracious care!"}
{"text":"We came here after a long night, not realizing how late it was. Came in, but they were closed. I expressed how hungry I was and they actually accommodated us. I gave them 5 stars because not only the food was good, they were so nice and has good customer service. This is a place you must go, for late night grub. Rita and all the workers, including the chef was nice enough to greet us. Best Chinese restaurant on my book."}
{"text":"Nice clean, comfortable restaurant. The service was decent for a Chinese restaurant. Anyhow, the food was clean tasting and cooked to perfection. The best part of the food was that it was authentic and did not taste too salty. The pan-fried crispy noodles with gravy is a must. I also recommend any fried fish or steam fish. Overall the food is fantastic and not overly salty which is a winner in my book. So go with a large group and taste the whole menu \"family style\" because the chefs here know how to cook Cantonese Hong Kong style food proper."}
{"text":"Never encountered where my family and I were served not fully cooked lamb. It was to the point after being chewed it was still whole. My mother felt sick and the server Ocean after informing him that it wasn't cooked properly showed no remorse. He offered to stir-fry the same dish again or a new one. My mother threw up everything. Who has an appetite after that. We tried to cancel the rest of the meal but the server said it's already cooked so we can't cancel the rest of it. When I said my mother left cause she wanted to throw up and he continued to yell at me if I wanted 911. An apology for starters would've of been nice, but instead I got yelled at. It's crazy how he handled that situation. Was it our fault it wasn't cooked properly, no. Also, don't get offended just because we declined something you suggest when ordering. We didn't want a free meal, only to pay the other dish we ate. He did take off the lamb, but was unwilling to cancel the other dish which didn't even come out yet. Lesson learned, will never return due to the poor attitude from that server. All the bussers were friendly."}
{"text":"The lent meatless Fridays edition (my fourth seafood review in a row) continues...

In all honesty, we only ended up here after being put on a 45 minute wait at Boiling Crab & Hot n' Juicy. I typed in \"SEAFOOD\" into Yelp... and yet again, you have not disappointed me, Yelp Gods! This place definitely hit the [seafood] spot!

We ordered 3 different entrees (and shared family style):
- HONEY WALNUT SHRIMP ($12.88): Large shrimp in a mayo based sauce with honey walnuts. 
- SHRIMP & EGG SATAY CHOW FUN: A stir fried dish of wide rice noodles, chinese broccoli, carrots and shrimp in a sweet-savory gravy like sauce. 
- SHRIMP WONTON NOODLE SOUP: Traditional shrimp wonton dumplings in a simple broth with thin, ramen-like noodles. 

Everything was very filling and we agreed it was definitely better than we expected! Very glad we ended up here as the restaurant was nice and filled with asian people (that has to be a good sign in Chinatown, right?!), and the food was not only delicious but also large portioned! We will definitely be back for our seafood fix here! :)"}
{"text":"Food still excellent.....Seafood very fresh....Clams in black bean sauce and string beans both superb also the seafood wonton soup...
Big portions!!!

Good Service

Definitely Recommended"}
{"text":"My family and I were in a quest for Chinese food in Vegas since we got tired of American food pretty quickly. The average price for the dishes were $12. 

Food: Good
- We ordered quite a few dishes (fried fish, steam fish, green beans, salt and pepper pork chop, French style beef, and duck)
- Out of all the dishes we ordered my favorite was the salt and pepper pork chop. I liked how they were crunchy and cut into smaller pieces.
- The fried fish was delicious, like always. A combination of soft and crispy, the fried fish is always a big hit.
- The steam fish was also good, but expensive. It is approximately $40+ because the fish is live and cooked to order (talk about fresh)!
- The French style beef was also very tender and juicy.

Location/Parking: Good
- Pretty easy to find and parking was no problem at 6pm.
- We called in for a reservation earlier that morning for 9 people on Christmas day and they were able to accommodate with no problem

Overall, my family really enjoyed the food here. We marked this as a place to come back to next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Just got a food for pick up, and still i am very happy with the food taste and quality of their ingredients! Will definitely come back and recommend to family and friends!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. We are greeted and seated in just a second. The service here is good. We've ordered string bean with olive vegetable, braised seafood tofu pot, honey chicken wings and seafood fried rice. The string bean with olive vegetable is a little bit salty but it's ok to serve with white rice. The braised seafood tofu pot is so yummy, and the taste of honey chicken wings really surprised me! Its taste as same as the one I'd in Macau. Definitely will come back here!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for my grandmother's birthday on Mid Jan 2017 after who knows how many owner changes since original opening on SK Seafood. As my grandmother loves seafood, we were definitely ordering some seafood. After being sat at our table and entire party has arrived shortly, the waitress brought us the menus, hot tea, and gave us a few minutes to decide on what to order. 

Lobster was if i remember correctly, $25/lb. There was a recommendation on quail as well for $28/ea. We had ordered 1 of the quail to try as it was a recommendation and a lobster cooked with green onions and ginger, on top of a bed of E-mein. On the wall, there are a lot of specials listed (though all in chinese so I personally cant read it, but my family can). We had ordered sand ginger chicken, deep fried chicken knee (more on this later lol), cumin lamb, garlic snow pea leaves, spicy wine clams, and preserved veggie large (pig) intestine. 

We were told the table next to us had a lobster about 4.5 lbs. When she brought ours out, she said it was the next biggest at 3.5ish. Oh well. Still live at least xD 

Soup came out which was a house dried veggie soup with pork neck bone, etc. Temp was luke warm. Flavor was decent but seemed maybe a little watered down. 

First to come out was the Lobster and Quail (cut to 6 pieces, enough to share). Quail's skin was perfectly crispy with moist, juicy meat under. A side of salt to dip in for flavor. Lobster was cooked perfectly as well. Lots of meat to share. The lobster as said was on a bed of E-mein. This was more of the disappointing part of the dish. The noodles were overcooked and over soft. The width of the noodles seemed to be bigger than the E-mein we had expected. Aside from the noodles, the lobster was amazing ! 

Deep fried chicken knee... ok some history on this for me. My first time having this dish was in Vancouver in 2004 at a wonton noodle place. They had it as a special so we ordered it to try. Simply deep fried chicken knees (the cartilage part of like the drumstick). Seasoned with salt and pepper. Simple and good ! When i went to Vancouver in 2012, i had to have it again. When we saw it on the specials menu, we had to order it.... It was good overall but it was not entirely the same cartilage part. i noticed some cartilage was from the breast bone, etc etc... my grandma said the had chicken skin too... So... not too genuine on the ingredients they used but still tasted pretty good. Seasoned with salt n pepper and deep fried garlic. 

Garlic snow peas leaves is simple and fresh. Good amount. Nothing else needs to be said. 

Preserved veggie large intestine was flavored well too. Big pieces of large intestine cooked with bell pepper, preserved veggie. Almost like a sweet and sour pork ! except with bell pepper, preserved veggies, black beans, and large intestine... love large intestine. cooked well. had a good \"bite\" to it still. Large fatty pieces. YUM !

Spicy wine clams was pretty decent. Not too spicy. The glass noodles soaked up the soup pretty fast. After a while, they were super fat noodles ! The clams were pretty good. Good amount of clams as well. Had enough to need to pawn off to the \"larger eaters\" of the family (me... -__-\") by the end of the meal. 

The cumin lamb and the sand ginger chicken was the most disappointing dishes of the meal. The sand ginger chicken (tbh iunoe what it was called in the menu, this is directly translated) had a very mild sand ginger flavor and was not savory at all. We ended up using the side salt from the quail for this dish. The cumin lamb, when it originally arrived, we asked the waitress if this was the right order. It seemed to have a lot of leek, celery, etc cooked with sliced lamb. The \"cumin\" flavor was super mild even when we told the waitress we liked spicy and a lot of cumin flavor. She had brought it back to the kitchen to ask to have more cumin added but even after it returned, there was still not much flavor. 

Overall, this meal was pretty decent except the last 2 dishes. The dessert (mung bean soup) was very mildly sweet as well with minimal mung bean. So i guess the last 3 items.. Meal costed a little over $200 for 6 people, with the lobster being almost half the cost."}
{"text":"Good chinese seafood, soup and desert tapioca gratis, good prices.
No frills environment, fast service, helpful servers explaining dishes."}
{"text":"I know, it's a seafood restaurant and I didn't order seafood- what was I thinking?!  I personally dislike how \"market price\" is listed for nearly every dish in the category, but found a bunch of other tasty items to try. Dishes are made quick and served family-style.

HOUSE SOUP: Gratis with meal, on the plain side, mostly broth with hints of ginger. Much appreciated to warm us up on our 40-degree evening.
SCALLION PANCAKES: Four-piece order, delicate and light with a nicely crisp exterior. These complemented our heartier entrees nicely.
LAMB AND LEEK: So good! Plenty of leeks and green onion, generous and tender portion of lamb, definitely something I would get again! 
\"EGGPLANT WITH GROUND PORK\": I assume there was a miscommunication because my dish had eggplant but no pork, but it was still good. Soft chunks of eggplant, a rich dark sauce, bits of ginger and red pepper everywhere. 
HOUSE DESSERT: Black sticky rice, date, and red bean soup, allegedly good for circulation, balanced flavor but not to my BF's liking. 

Service was shockingly good- I'm used to receiving the bare minimum at most places on Spring Mountain, but here we were checked up on regularly by several staff members. Pricing was reasonable, the above was just over $30 with tip. I will be coming back to try the seafood items or clay pot dishes."}
{"text":"One of the better chinese restaurants in Chinatown. Clean and authetic vibe. Waiter spoke English and Chinese fluently. 
Complimentary house soup to start and free sweet soup dessert. 
The dishes we ordered were delicious.  The salt and pepper wings were fried perfectly- in a word magnificent! or (?????) 
I saw many different dishes,  live lobster was being brought out to show the freshness.
I will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"I have given them 3 stars in the past.  I have to say my recent visit has been fantastic.  Both food and services are topnotch among Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Authentic. Didn't waste time taking pictures because I wanted to eat. We ordered egg rolls, fish balls, sweet sour chicken and fukkin fried rice. Good service, no disappointments IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AUTHENTIC FOOD!  Not Americanized."}
{"text":"This place replaced 102 hotpot and my oh my is it delicious. I went here with my boyfriends family so they always order everything (being Chinese and all lol) and they ordered the usual- pan fried seabass, stir fried snow pea leaves, sticky fried rice, black peppered beef, some egg thing with seafood in it, crispy noodles with mushroom, winter melon soup, honey walnut shrimp, and more I don't know what it was called haha everything came out timely and hot. They all had good flavor. The seabass was one of my favorite. It comes out with three big pieces and they give you this soy sauce that you pour over it. So good!!! The honey walnut shrimp I really enjoyed because it wasn't too rich in mayonnaise and it wasn't too sweet- it was just right. The snow pea leaves were so garlicky and good! If you're not a fan of garlic, I would steer clear of this one. The sticky fried rice had pieces of I want to say, char siu pork in it, and vegetables. It's kind of sweet so if you don't like sweet steer clear! The waiters kept coming out and asking us if we needed anything (which is different than most Chinese restaurants I have to say). They continuously made sure we had water and tea. They also Leo clearing out plates and giving us new ones for our food. Oh! The winter melon soup was so good especially since it's cold outside! Everything was just so good I loved it. We usually go to kj kitchen but I believe we will be coming here from now on! So yum!"}
{"text":"Food was good and service was great. Price is very reasonable for the quality of food and service we get. Got free soup and dessert too. Definitely will come back for more tasty Cantonese food!"}
{"text":"I've only had one thing here which was the wonton soup with noodles.  Broth was good but a little on the salty side.  They give you a lot of wontons and they're packed with shrimp and pork.  There is also a generous amount of noodles and veggies.  I think it was about $10 and I was satisfied my meal.  Other items are on the pricier side.  The service was great!  Looking forward to trying other entrees."}
{"text":"Bad mood.
The server girl.the short one.handle the soup bowls.Thumb in side the bowl.Not under liner.It makes the whole meal feel bad.
We do not want suck your thumb."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and brother for dinner after having lunch here that day.

The ambiance of this restaurant is your typical Cantonese restaurants in Chinatown. Nothing fancy, but quite clean and tidy. Pictures of food on the wall. Wait staff is very helpful. 

First lunch, we ordered:
1. Spicy beef slices -  $3.99. Beef is slightly tough, but otherwise an excellent dish. If the beef slices were soaked in the porridge, it is softened a lot. I will rate this dish a B+. 
2. Jelly fish - $3.99. Good tasty dish for appetizers. A solid A-.
3. Onion Pancake - $3.00 . Another solid B+.
4. Meat Ball  Porridge - an excellent bowl of porridge.  A solid A. 

Then for dinner, we ordered:
1, Scallion Crab - a super dish. One of the best crabs I have had. An A, no ifs or buts.
2. Broccoli in white wine sauce - another solid A.
3. Spicy beef slices - a repeat from this morning. 
4. Steam Bleeker Fish ?? - We made an error on this. This type of fish should be pan fried and not steamed. If it were steamed, the fish meat texture will be too mushy. Not an issue with the cook. Still it is not a great dish. 
5. Princess Chicken ( ??? ) --   too tough but when we were asked how the dishes were, we indicated to the waitress and this dish was not charged. This dish would have gotten a D+.

Both lunch and dinner were served with house soup -- Cantonese soup. Rice comes with the entrees. Tea is without question, part of the meal. 

A very enjoyable dinner place. If you like Cantonese seafood, you will like this place. 

I have a rough time to give any Chinese restaurant a 5 star, but this one comes close to it. But because of the ambiance, because of the fish dish, and also because of the chicken dish, I lowered it to a 4 star. Although, I can be talked into giving it a 5 star."}
{"text":"Came here again with family for Father's day lunch. Service is good as always. The food quality has gone down from previous visits. Highlights was the beef noodle soup, wonton noodle soup, chinese brocolli with garlic and salt and pepper shrimp. The steamed fish was off with texture and taste. The string beans with XO sauce didn't taste like xo sauce but like chili sauce. Sand chicken was too cold and tough. Extra star for the service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday.  The place was packed.  My friend commented that he was the only white face in the whole joint.  The should tell you the kind of food they served.  Real deal Cantonese cooking with a little northern flavor thrown in.  They have a lunch menu with 2-3 dollars discount from their regular menu.
The meat ball porridge and the fish ball porridge were as good as any I ever had.  The sticky rice fried rice with dried sausage and dried pork belly was not stuck together, awesome. 
And then there is the service.  So un-Chinese restaurant.  Manager Bill made some great recommendations, and he is always checking on the diners.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive, they actually look at the customers when they are walking by and will stop if you wave at them, and they all speak fluent English, wow.
Will be back to check out some of the dinner specials."}
{"text":"Authentic Cantonese food.  Fresh food and quick service.  Soup and green bean dessert are free.   Busy on Friday evening"}
{"text":"The Skinny: decent authentic Cantonese style restaurant (4) service: surprisingly excellent service for a Chinese restaurant FYI: no diaper changing station but the bathrooms are clean(4) value: reasonably priced dishes that are generally well executed (4 starred review)

Ever since HK Star became another restaurant (and the quality went way down), we were looking for a suitable replacement in town. SK seafood fits the bill as the go-to casual Chinese place.

This restaurant is more of a traditional Cantonese style joint albeit with cleaner environment and surprisingly excellent service. (By excellent, I mean like no hassle for getting ice water and on the ball with refills....unheard of in a Chinese restaurant!) The wait staff is amazingly good and happy to make recommendations if you are stuck.

For now, they will always give you soup to start...even during lunchtime. Dinner includes a dessert as well.

We've tried multiple things on the menu (which is large!) and there are a few standouts and a couple of misses.

Things that great: pork neck meat with stir-fried assorted mushrooms(a great dish...a must try!), stir-fried eggplant, stir-fried pea shoots leaves with garlic (seasonal item: only good during Spring usually), green onion pancake, salt and pepper fish fillet (on the lunch menu, it is a good deal), braised tofu, salt and pepper tofu and fried tofu. The wonton noodles are also very solid (My mom is very particular about this dish and it got her seal of approval).

Their stir-fried dishes are not overly coated with large amounts of goopy sauce. A major plus in my book.

The misses were the salt and pepper pork chops and the sweet and sour pork. The reason is the pork is a little too fatty for me rather than an issue with execution.

Overall prices are very reasonable and on par with other Chinese establishments in town. Serving sizes are generous.

With a large menu to explore, great service and good prices, this place will keep you coming back for more! 4 starred review."}
{"text":"Came because of the good reviews. Got the sticky rice because the waitress recommended it to me. But it was way too salty. After the third bite, there was a ROCK in the rice that almost cracked my teeth.. Complete TRASH and NOT worth 11 BUCKS!!"}
{"text":"Just happened upon this hole in the wall gem!  Food was fantastic, service was great with friendly people!"}
{"text":"All of the orders we had were great. Nice service deserved wonderful praise. I strongly recommend this restaurant when you have an opportunity to visit Las Vegas and is of willingness to taste Chinese foods. Thank you all!"}
{"text":"This has became our go-to Chinese restaurant. We used to frequent KJ but their quality went down. 
SK has really good authentic HK style Chinese cuisine.  
Nothing is taste bad.
I highly recommend."}
{"text":"No good mood on it, seafood restaurant with no seafood. I reviewed the pictures and want to order the food I like. All none, only the green beans I can ordered. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Went there for the first time and I tried over 10 dishes... everything was so tasty. We had salted egg yolk crab, knife clams (?) with garlic, fried pigeon (my absolute FAVORITE... crispy and juicy), jelly fish, pig ears, cold app cucumbers, e noodles, strip bass chef special, sand ginger chicken and more. I don't think there was a dish I didn't like. I took photos but it doesn't do the taste justice. 

I will be back for more authentic Chinese food. And thanks Ocean, for the great service!"}
{"text":"SUPER SUPER SUPER GOOD!!! My husband ordered the lobster with ginger and garlic sauce and yumm!! It was $25 per lbs of course the smallest one they had was a 4 1/2lblobster lol just for us two but hell we were in Vegas haha..no regret except the regret that we couldn't finish about 15% of it. We also ordered salt and pepper shrimp that was also sooo good and tasty. Soup was free, rice was free and dessert was free...How could you beat that? Honestly I don't expect much service at Chinese Restaurants and that is not me being racist but those of you who go to these places know what I am talking about; however, this place every single worker did so well, worked so fast and was so efficient with their time and respect, WE WILL BE BACK WITH FAMILY!!! Thank you so much! Please continue making great food and providing great customer service."}
{"text":"Grabbed food late night. Got the eggplant hot pot and seafood hot pot, food wasn't bad. Did have a strand of metal Brillo pad in my food, luckily it was towards the end of the takeout box."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack hoping it would taste the same as the day time, but everything was bland, not sure what was going on with the chef that evening! Each of the dishes didnt have much of a taste to it. Either the chef has forgotten to add salt to them or he was half a asleep!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. We came here for the second time, still impressed. We ordered salty egg fried tofu aka golden sand tofu, the inside was smooth, fresh soft and the outside was crisp, not greasy, covered with just the right amount of tiny specks of salt egg yolk. Tasted superb. Also ordered plum sauce ribs..... the best! not like your run of the mill deep fried breaded sweet n sour ribs, SK's ribs are tasty, you know the quality is good when they don't use any heavy sauce to mask the refrigeration odor of overly frozen meat. Presentation of dishes were neat, clean, and color were perfect e.g. Golden is golden, not grease plus yellow flour. Service from waitress Amy was excellent as well. She is attentive, polite and caring, makes great recommendations too! Trust me, this place Is worth your try! I am Not related to them. I m just a Fan ! God bless."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant after reading many positive reviews. It cost $40.00 round trip to take the cab to this restaurant, but it's worth it. We came just before many more people arrived, so it was a short 15 minutes wait only. The food is \"genuine\" Cantonese cuisine with the exception of a number of Sichuan-style dishes. The price is very reasonable, noodle and rice dishes around $8.00 to $10.00 and meat/vegi dishes around $10 to $20. Live seafood is season price so I have no comment. The taste is very authentic, not too salty and not greasy. If you want to drink beer, you have to pay cash for the drink. They also serve complimentary \"daily special\" soup. We were served homestyle carrot/turnip sugar cane with pork bone soup. Delicious! We will eat here again before we leave Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food and pricing a lot of places to eat here this one is top notch! 

Prices are fair and we didn't have to wait a long time for our food either.

Great place and clean would highly recommend."}
{"text":"No meat on Friday
So we went to Chinatown
Looking for seafood.

The menu was vast
But I knew what I wanted -
Honey walnut shrimp.

Was highly impressed
With how the dish was not drenched
In the mayo sauce.

Walnuts were crispy
And the sauce was not too sweet.
This dish was just right!"}
{"text":"We were quite disappointed that SK ?? Seafood Restaurant was not up to par as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. We came as recommended by friends and ordered the followings as suggested.
The dishes we tried were: 
1. Braised Pork Belly (??? $ 13):  a failure. They probably don't know how to do it (this is a Cantonese restaurant, and the dish is typically a Hunan's)
2. Clam with black bean sauce (???? $14): a classic Cantonese style, very good.
3. SK Steam Fish Ball (????? $13): Their specialty? Ordinary in taste, flavor and presentation.

The setting and decoration were decent. Service was just OK."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after my massage in Chinatown seeing they had some good reviews. Unfortunately they were out of the Dungeness crab  so we tried the duck which was ok but not the best. I was pretty dissatisfied with the shrimp chow fun but I tried it with gravy this time which I don't usually do so that may have been my fault. The pork belly looked amazing but even that wasn't that great. Next time I come I should probably just get my normal favorites to give it the best chance

Just wanted to add though that the waiters were very nice and tried to be helpful"}
{"text":"We ordered stir fry fish with bean sauce, dumpling soup and greens with beef.I think we had 3 or 4 people waiting on us, 2 people. The fish was cooked perfect, nice flavor. Was tossed in onion and green pepper, both of which I do not like, but it was probably listed as such and I did not read the menu right. My wive loved the dumpling soup and the greens we had were yaw chow I think, for $5 you can get little slices of beef so we took that option. It was very tasty. I would probably have gone 5 stars but I thought it was slightly expensive overall."}
{"text":"We ate lunch there, and the lunch menu was affordable and lots of variety to pick from. The food we chose all were yummy and authentic Cantonese style cooking. Will definitely eat there when we visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"First off,the food is excellent.  Las Vegas has a lot of Chinese restaurants to be sure, every strip mall in the city seems to have one.  Chinese food is my favorite, and it is good  to find  a nice clean place for dinner when I don't want to cook it myself.  My sister and I had Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Mongolian Beef, and Chicken Fried Rice.  I wouldn't order the fried rice again, very bland.  But the other two dishes, they knocked it out of the park.  Very good.  The service was good, nice people.  I just wonder: with all of that food to eat, why did they give us these little plates to pile it onto?  Good food, clean bathrooms give a positive hint about the kitchen.  It's a decent place that I will go back to.  Viva good Chinese!"}
{"text":"In China town the food is better than another places . More Fresh...

But the sea foods pricey than normal.

The fish was 62$ not that good taste... too many bone feel like eat  chicken  

The lobster was 115$ went to Lake side at Wynn same weight was 86$ how do you compare the place...

Always coming back coz the girl was kind the not sea food was excellent...
Also when you come inside the restaurant you can smell like some animal died... talked to the waitress twice different day... still same

If the manager see my review hope can smell better next time when we there...

I think we eat food not just hungry  
Mouth  eat .eyes  eat. Nose  eat too..."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer here.  Never let me down.  Good taste and value for the $.  I like this place.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great, cheap Chinese food if you're in Vegas. They give you free broth/soup as a starter."}
{"text":"0 stars. Sat in the restaurant for 20+ minutes and attempted to order three times. In addition, no water, no tea given. Waiter and waitress kept telling us to wait. But took orders from other patrons. When we got up to leave, the waiter then wanted to take our order. Waste of time."}
{"text":"High quality of food and service! Best chinese restaurant in town! I personally like the deep fried squab the most, it's so juicy and tasty. It is a \"must try\" item."}
{"text":"A good place for some Chinese food and certain dishes that you normally can't find.  Came here for lunch on the last day of being in Vegas, and it was a good change from ther buffets and acye places.  The food comes out pretty fast and they have a good selection of items.  Some of the stand out dishes include their Chinese sausage with this hybrid of a cauliflower/brocolli dish,  fresh eel in black bean sauce (the group liked), steamed chicken with ginger, and Westlake soup. The winds and potstickers were also tasty, along with the preserved pork and egg congee.

A lot of their pricing ends in \".88\", which I thought was interesting.  I believe \"8\" is considered a lucky number."}
{"text":"We were visiting for a convention show and tried a few different Chinese seafood restaurants, but was really disappointed. So, we decided to give this place a last shot.

This restaurant is not too big and not too small, but very simple and clean too.  The food is served in big portions with original Chinese flavors.  Plus, they offered complimentary soup daily, and upon request, they will continue to refill your bowl for you!   The soup is very flavorable and nutritious, along with the dessert.  Traditional Cantonese style food.

And, we were still not done yet when the owner, with such a warm and genuine heart, knew that we caught a taxi over to the restaurant, she kindly offered us a free ride back to our hotel!

The chefs cooked really tasty food at a very fair price.  I would definitely eat at this restaurant every night.

I strongly recommend everyone to eat there!  You will be more than happy enjoying your meals and having a super, fantastic friendship with the owner!  She is someone very sweet, with a loving heart, that I guarantee you will keep going back for more!  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner!!!

{"text":"A very good Cantonese Chinese place in Chinatown Las Vegas. Pretty good menu selection with all the usual suspects available. Good seafood selection too. Prices not too bad."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for quite awhile now.  Finally with family in town, we decided to come here. We got here at around 7:30 pm.  It wasn't too busy with a few empty tables.  We ordered 4 dishes and they all came out from the kitchen pretty fast.  The string beans with minced meat was stir fried prefectly with lots of \"wok hay\". The deep fried salt and pepper pork chop was tasty and crispy. The bean curd lamb pot was also very good and many chunks of lamb meat in it.  Their special salty chicken was a bit on the small side but very tasty.  Our meal also came with free soup and coconut taro root dessert which were also delicious.  Our waiter was very attentive and changed our bone saucer plates without asking. He even offered us a second bowl of dessert.  I definitely will come again to try other dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"Rarely review restaurants but this one is very very good. Reasonable menu prices and we had a coupe of very innovative dishes - the home made fishball and the lotus wrapped steamed chicken. The Chow Fun with black beans was very well done. Service was good. They were attentive and polite and changed out our plates once during the meal. We have been here 3 times in the last month alone. And free soup and dessert. Hope they hang on to their chef."}
{"text":"If I could give 1/2 stars I would rate this place a 4.5. This is a pretty solid authentic Cantonese restaurant in Chinatown. 

It's great that they have the lunch menu available on the weekend. Other places would limit the lunch menu to weekdays only. 

I came here for the Braised frog legs that I saw on their menu online or so I thought. Actually my bf likes frog legs, I don't really care for it. I asked the waiter about this but they don't serve it at all. 

Our order-

Their Signature Crispy Squab ($18.88)- it was more of a roasted than fried. It had crispy skin and tasted fresh.

Shredded Duck w/Braised Noodle ($9.88)- it wasn't dry but moist with plenty of shredded duck. 

Deep Fried Shrimp w/salt & pepper ($9.88)- it was breaded and did not disappoint. 

Tsing Tao Beer $4. 
Total lunch $46.16.

All three dishes were so satisfying.

The server was attentive. 

We will def be back!"}
{"text":"From los angeles,  (which has the best chinese food in the US).  This place is legit... Good quality...  Good service.  If you're looking for reasonably priced authentic chinese (hk seafood style)  food you've come to the right place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. 
It was not a weekend but this place was packed. 90% Chinese people and they were not from Sea gull holiday crowd. (That big yellow bus affiliated with a few Chinese restaurants in town.) This means the food is good and authentic. 
There was only one waiter working. He was waiting on 10 different tables himself. The service was slow but he was very nice and helpful with the menu. I think he was the only one working here that spoke English. I asked a busboy for a water but didn't understand. The specials on the menu was in Chinese, no English. I guess that's because most of their customers are Chinese.
Everything we had was delicious. Much better taste than my regular neighborhood Chinese place. The price was very reasonable and the portion was big.
I think their air conditioner was not working properly. I was sweating when I was eating. They had one of those portable air conditioning system in the corner of the store.
I may come back here for dinner to try their frog legs dish."}
{"text":"For incredible Chinese seafood dishes SK is the place. A friend referred us here who has been going there for years, and it doesn't disappoint. The food is expertly prepared and the setting is very cozy and open. The noodle dishes are out of this world, and the seafood dishes are worth the venture. Good service and a fun experience"}
{"text":"The seafood and foods is good here.The prices is reasonable. They have free daily soup here and gd service. There was four of us and we all having gd time here."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Food was tremendous service very friendly, we saw several locals eating here."}
{"text":"Some of the best Cantonese food in town. Service is fast and friendly. Definitely a place to bring your family."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars - Pretty good - service and food were both decent. My favorite dishes was probably the egg yolk crab."}
{"text":"Close to the best Cantonese seafood restaurant in taste compared to irvine.  Had live sweet shrimp stream best tasting, exceeded my expectations in the desert."}
{"text":"Very authentic Cantonese food, you must try roast pigeon which have  so real flavor like Zhongshan City where I came from."}
{"text":"The best Chinese Restaurant in town so far!!! The place is nice and clean with good service."}
{"text":"I liked the staff, they were friendly and not snobbish like many Chinese restaurants. The food was very good and price was reasonable. I feel that most people have their favorite Chinese dishes and their own unique taste buds, so I don't normally recommend a specific dish. You would just have yo try it and experience this restaurant for yourself. Overall I really liked SF and it would be my place to go for good Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is good for kids. Food was great. Their customer service was good. We ordered steam egg so our little ones can eat, the first one was over cooked so they were nice to offer to remake another one. Do recommend this place to my friends and families!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for affordable Chinese food. This is a decent place off strip. I took my parents here on a holiday trip after Christmas. It was busy on the strip so we went to this place. So far it's the best spot I've found. Good food at an affordable place. We had the seafood tofu pot, pork chops, complimentary house soup and a few other dishes. The portion sizes could be a bit larger."}
{"text":"This place is seriously a hidden gem!  The restaurant itself was clean, the service was fast and friendly (especially for an Asian restaurant), and the prices were phenomenal for the portion sizes. I cannot recommend this place enough.  Just remember this place isn't going to be your standard Panda Express, it's authentic Chinese food.  I came here with my parents on a Sunday a little after 11 am.  My mom was definitely in one of those \"her eyes were bigger than her stomach\" type of moods and one thing led to another...and we ended up ordering six separate dishes for the three of us.  Luckily each and every single thing we ordered was delicious and all for under $45! 

We ordered:
-Cold Jelly Fish ($5.88) - refreshing, the jellyfish is mixed in with pickled radishes and carrots
-Wonton Soup ($4.88) - came out piping hot, however SK offers a free house soup for lunch and dinner so I would skip over this and just eat the house soup
-Stir Fried Squid with Black Bean Sauce ($7.88) - squid sautéed with sweet onions, green bell peppers, and a flavorful black bean sauce 
-Braised Seafood Tofu Pot ($8.88) - came in a hot clay pot full of fish, shrimp, squid, and some of the most flavorful tofu I've ever eaten
-Beef String Bean ($7.88) - standard yet solid beef and green bean dish, just the right amount of sauce
-Fried Flounder ($7.88) - crispy and flaky deliciousness, fried fish usually isn't my thing but I still found myself liking this dish 

I will definitely be back here to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"First time to here. For celebrate husband's birthday. Really classic Cantonese restaurant. We ordered lobster, black pepper beef, and vegetables. So good! Especially the lobster. So fresh. We love it. And before the meal. They supply the free soup. So classic hometown favorite. After the meal. They supply free desert. So delicious even though we already feel full . And the waitress service. They're so active and friendly. They'll give you many advices. To be honest, for me. This meal much better than the Michelin we took couple days ago in my birthday. At least I knew what I am eating. Lol. Lol."}
{"text":"This is one of the newer Chinese restaurants on Spring Mountain and I have not been disappointed at all. The service is fast and the food is excellent. 

My favorite dish of all time is salt and pepper pork chop. There have been too many restaurants who just don't make it right. Ever since the management changed at Food Express on Decatur, I've been chasing the pork dragon. Well the day has finally come where I can happily buy 5 orders and be pleased with the consistency and crunchiness throughout all the dishes.

You can't go wrong with the lobster, fish and tofu dishes here either. They have all the dishes you can easily get at any other Chinese restaurant but they don't skimp out on portions here and it tastes so much better."}
{"text":"In our short 5-day stay in Vegas, we came here 3 times. That must tell you something about how good the food is here. The service is good too. Each time the servers were very attentive and gave us something (broth and/or dessert soup) on the house. I especially recommend the last two beef dishes in the beef section on the menu, very succulent and tender."}
{"text":"We we had the bittermelon beef, snow pea leaves , salted chicken fried rice and stir fried shrimp with egg.  Portions were family style and generous and targets for bigger parties. 
Decent food in the area 

Service was attentive and food came out prompt.
There was no wait on Sunday night"}
{"text":"We tried this place while back visiting Vegas. They have excellent Cantonese food. I don't remember everything we got but most of the dishes were great. Standouts were the lobster, the duck, and the squab. Overall it was definitely pricey for off-strip Vegas. These were California prices not desert prices. I subtracted 1 star for the overpricing, but the food is 5-star."}
{"text":"Nice quaint restaurant off the beat path of the busy Vegas strip. I can't think of any cons for this establishment. Here is my breakdown of why I believe this restaurant deserves 5 stars.

- Friend and attentive service
- Fresh ingredients
- Well made food (everything we ordered was solid)
- They offered free soup and dessert

What we really enjoyed:
- Fried halibut
- Five spice pork chops
- Honey walnut shrimp

I would not hesitate to come back here."}
{"text":"Food was good.  It was not salty and tasted right.  We had some fish with mushroom, string beans and crispy chicken.  The complimentary soup was very tasty too.  Will definitely come back but not when it is too busy.  When we were here last time, we had to stand and wait for 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us till we walked out of the restaurant and one of the waiters came running out to get us back into the restaurant.  Service was bad that time as the restaurant was busy."}
{"text":"From a Cantonese person: The food here doesn't taste good. Not cooked well. I had high expectations from reading other reviews. The waiter was being nice to suggest us to order more so we over ordered.... and everything tasted so bad."}
{"text":"Thought to try this place for lunch based on the good reviews. We got the squab, Chinese broccoli/kailan, clams with black bean sauce and steamed tilapia.

The fish was very fresh (right out of the tank) and probably the best dish. The clams were fresh as well, juicy, plump and served with generous mix of green and red bell peppers which I love. The reasons for not giving 5 stars were due to the kailan not being more leafy parts and the squab wasn't more flavorful. Both were cooked well though.

The complimentary soups are only for dinner.

We plan to be back for the fresh fish!"}
{"text":"My first time, brought my family of 5, saw the pictures on Yelp convinced me this place was going to be good.  And the food was amazing!  The service is shorthanded but attentive and hardworking.  We got the steamed fish, French styled beef, streamed fresh scallops on the shell, clams with basil and beef chow foon, pan fried noodle dish.  There was a complimentary stewed soup that was delicious and refreshing.  The taro tapioca dessert soup at the end was good. Their dishes all had a great taste and cooked to perfection.  Their meats are so tender.  Prices are very fair for the quality.  Our family ate to our hearts content and wanted to eat more - it was that good.  Would come back again if we could."}
{"text":"SK is one of the newer Cantonese restaurants in Vegas. I've heard good things about this place from friends ,so I came to check it out. I was not disappointed at all. In fact, I was really surprised how good the service was compared to other Cantonese places. I don't remember the waiter's name but he's a young Chinese guy. He provided a great service which I hardly have experienced in Chinese restaurant. I enjoyed most of the stuff that we order as well.

The great thing about Cantonese restaurant is that you get free daily soup and dessert soup. I enjoyed both their daily soup and dessert soup a lot as well. Walnut shrimp, salt and pepper tofu, salt and pepper chicken wings, and jelly fish are some of my favorite from our dinner. 

I'm going to come back soon ,and try out other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"if u like authentic Cantonese food, this is the place.... they got live seafood made to order, l think they changed owner, lunch special price has been adjusted a little more .... overall food is up to par... not as many varieties as some others in town"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight: Singapore noodles were good. kung pao chicken and walnut shrimp were recommended by the waitress and very mediocre. 
Panda Express has tastier kung pao which is sad. 
We ordered the green beans, the dish came as we were just finishing our last bites. 
Did they have to go out to a market for the green beans? 
We had free soup, very bland but it's free so no complaining, just could've used a tad more seasoning."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for a Sunday night dinner. For the four of us we got 4 dishes: garlic string beans, beef chow fun, seafood tofu hotpot, and Peking Pork chop. The meal came with complimentary rice and house soup. 

The soup was good. Sweet from the carrots. The dishes we ordered were wonderful and decently portioned. The garlic string beans were fried. The garlic sauce on it added savoriness. The Peking pork chops were sweet and saucy but some of the pieces were too fatty. The tofu seafood hotpot had a good portion of fish shrimp and squid. It was really good. I loved the soft texture of the tofu. The beef chow fun was also great. The meat is not too chewy. It was tender and delicious. 

At the end of the meal they also gave us complimentary dessert. It was an egg and pumpkin tapioca soup. It was on the sweeter side but I love anything complimentary. 

Overall the prices of this place might be slightly higher but it's still reasonable. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite places in LV. Best Mongolian Beef. You should try..."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an early dinner.  I am white and she is Chinese.  We eat out a lot, and have been to China and Hong Kong.  We are spoiled and picky when it comes to Chinese food.  First, the restaurant is flexible.  I asked if they could do something that was not on the menu.  No problem.  I ordered bitter melon with black bean and fish.  Absolutely delicious.  The wonton soup was great.  A very generous serving.  Any time I am in Las Vegas, I will go back to this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese food restaurant out of all the ones I've tried. Everything we have ordered here has been good which is rare. Usually restaurants will do a few dishes well, a few dishes not so well and everything in between.

My parents and I always hit up here when they're in town visiting. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Cantonese food in Las Vegas hands down. Yea typical Chinese restaurant interior, but the food is definitely not typical. Looks like the place could need some update, but it's clean and that's what's most important. I had a fresh steamed red cod and live crab, golden egg yolk style. Super yummy and service was on point. I will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant in Vegas period. Come check it out but make sure to get a reservation cuz they are always busy. We had the lobster, clams, crabs, quails, and a few other dishes and they are all nderful. Service was fast and good too"}
{"text":"My Dad raved about this restaurant since they came here before with my other siblings for a Mother's Day celebration. I on the other hand have to disagree with his love for this place. We came here today for lunch after a graduation. We had a party of about 25 people and there were about 5 other people in the restaurant. The free soup they gave was cold. We had to send back an order of pan fried noodles because it was burnt. Food came out very slow. We had 3 tables and we ordered the same for all but they kept on messing up. Not all tables were getting their order and when we asked about it they questioned every little thing including checking plates to ensure we haven't received the amount we orders. I asked for silverware and water 5x before I was given water and the utensils I got myself at the counter. 

To top it off, it's 110 outside yet it was hot in their restaurant. Felt as if their AC was not running

It was a waste of money! I will def not be back!"}
{"text":"Solid Chinese with good flavors. Not too spicy for the American pallet. Hint, ask for extra small bowls and spoons so you can enjoy the great sauces. The ambiance is typical Chinese strip mall, nothing special. So what; the food is good and the prices reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was really good. The food was great, really well executed dishes. This restaurant was a highlight of our trip to Las Vegas. I will surely return when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent meal!  My wife had the shrimp w/ black bean sauce and I had the deep fried fish, salt & pepper. We had the green beans with garlic as a side.  And for an appetizer, fried buns.  Everything was perfect and the fish was crispy, light and perfectly seasoned.  The buns were a pure delight!

The wait staff was attentive and very helpful!  We would come back anytime!!  Thank you, SK Seafood for a delightful meal!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday afternoon. First pleasant surprise, they don't close for lunch like some other Chinese places. We got there at 2 and was afraid we weren't going to be able to eat. But they're open all day. Seated very quickly. We already knew we wanted to eat steamed crab and saw that it was $30 for a crab, which seems comparable to all the other places. Also got an appetizer pig ear. 
Once we were done ordering, they brought out a big bowl of old fire soup, or house soup, which was comprised of bones and various vegetables. It tastes like it's been on the stove all day. The pig ear was served and big portions for $3.88. Watch out for the kick of the Szechuan peppercorns on that! 

Then the main event. Crab was steamed with garlic and the picture is worth 100 words. It was fresh and flavorful, made me eat more rice than normal because I was dousing it with the crab juice. 

I like how the servers are attentive, the place seems clean, they all speak English well, and of course the food was delicious. Love and will come back on my next trip"}
{"text":"Great place off the strip. Fresh seafood and nice white table cloths to amp up their style. 

We had half of a roast duck and clams with black bean sauce. Duck was a tad dry, clams excellent.

This is worth the drive, about 10 minutes from the strip. In a long strip mall. 
Looks like you can get a Chinese massage close to here if you have time."}
{"text":"Love this Place... one of the best chinese Rest. in Las Vegas and price is Right!!! I recommend all my friends and family to stop by this place when in L.V. and craving for chinese food. Also you will have more luck after a full stomach here...ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely fast service, good food, lots of choices.
We went on a weekend and there was no wait."}
{"text":"What a great little place! Solid Cantonese food served up by some people that hustle. The service is a bit haphazard but competent. This is a typical family Chinese place.  Formica tables, linoleum floors and a bit \"sweaty\".  The food is the star of the show and is well done.  We tried the salt n pepper pork, Chinese vegetables with garlic sauce, and braised tofu.   All three were well prepared and served hot.  In typical cheese fashion, each dish was delivered as the kitchen finished making it.   

As stated earlier, it makes the service chaotic but your food is hot!   We were there two hours and I was the only non-Asian patron in the place.  Always a good sign from my experience!  Highly recommend this place if you want Cantonese fair.  Two thumbs up from us!"}
{"text":"If a picture is worth a thousand words, see my pictures.  All dishes were delicious!  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great authentic restaurant in Vegas. Nice addition to Vegas Chinatown. We missed Anna's Garden when it closed few years ago. This is great replacement!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem for Chinese seafood.  A fresh variety of dishes cooked to perfection at low prices.  Not the best looking place but service is great.  Near Saigon 8 on Lindell.  I have the abalone w/black mushrooms, the sea bass in black bean sauce and some oysters baked to die for.  Fresh Chinese vegetable accompany your lobster, crab, shrimp, etc.  Try the Chinese sausage for something new.  Family style servings and served right out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and was looking for a Chinese restaurant that served fresh Dungeness crab dishes.  Searched Yelp and came across SK Seafood, went there with my family and found it full of Chinese people which is always an excellent sign at a Chinese restaurant.  
       Ordered black bean clam, pan fried noodles, salt and pepper pork chops, fish maw and crab soup and a Dungeoness crab prepared ginger style($45).   Grand total was $100 for six of us, very tasty and I was especially impressed by the fast, polite and professional service! A number of us were saying that this was one of the best service experiences we've ever had a Chinese restaurant.  And they provide you with complimentary warm tapioca dessert-- so comforting!    Definitely would come back again.    Sorry, ate too fast to take any pics."}
{"text":"I am a chef, so this is easy for me to write. Where do I start. Let's go down the list. Location, very good. Store front, very good. Host, one of the worst. Service and servers, one of the worst. Food, 3 out of 10. Prices, very overpriced. All in all, don't waste your money. There are so many places to eat when you visit Chinatown Vegas."}
{"text":"I REALLY want to give the full 5 stars for this place but my last visit left a bad taste in my mouth. First visit to this restaurant was AMAZING. The waiters (which were all men and had a laid back attitude) gave us our menus and answered any questions we had. They brought out our food in a timely manner and fulfilled any request. During the first visit we fell in love with the food and service which made us want to come back. 

Today we came back for a second time and boyyyy I don't really know if I want to come back! This time the servers were all women and omg they were really CONTROLLING! Let's start with the first 5 mins of sitting...Can someone explain to me why they gave us 1 lunch menu for 3 people! Um wth how am I suppose to look at the menu?? So we ask for 2 more menus so we can all choose what we want. 

Second problem...Drinks. Where are they?? I asked for 3 waters and a soda. Simple enough right? Nope! Our dishes arrived before the drinks! & When the server did give our drinks she chose not to give us straws even though it was on the tray she was HOLDING! Like why you holding out?? 

Third problem...The bill. Do I look like I'm going to run away or something?? Food gets to the table and so does the bill. Ok, so I'll pay it after I eat right? NOPE! I thought wrong! The waitress informs me that I must pay NOW and I should be the FIRST to pay before the other two customers that are sitting at my table. Wtf?? So I get up and pay the bill. 

Fourth problem...The bill AGAIN! So now she tells me that she forgot to add the soda to my bill. REALLY?? So once again I have to take a pause from eating my meal to pay again! 

Fifth problem...I mean really there's a fifth problem? This can't be real smh. I ask for to go boxes. You know the regular sized to go boxes...well guess what apparently this paying customer cannot have one. I must settle for the TEENY TINY TO GO BOXES. Keep in mind that I had about 4 dishes that needed a box! The waitress insist that the food can fit, but guess what! The sauces of all the food spilled and I had a mess to clean up once I got home! 

Sixth problem..This is getting ridiculous isn't it?? So I order sweet and sour chicken to go and guess what!? IT'S FREAKIN PORK! They clearly speak english fine BUT these women don't care to listen to what the customer says or wants! These women want to do whatever it is that they want to do. 

I can see myself going back BUT I do not want to be served by these specific female waitresses. Don't get me wrong I am not against female servers. What I am against are women who are controlling what I order and when I have to pay!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is continually changing it's menu so at one stage they gave you multiple menus they offered.  Food is excellent but they need to settle on price.  Lobster is too high. Overall it's the best in town."}
{"text":"Classy Chinese restaurant located a few blocks away from Chinatown.

For a party of two with three entrees, we spent around $50 bucks, which wasn't too bad! The server was really friendly too, which was awesome.

First, they served us complementary soup, which was yummy. After that, our dishes arrived within minutes .. like literally. Solid Chinese dishes with little to no complaints. 

Overall, I'd come here again! We also got warm taro dessert soup afterwards, which was a delicious treat!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas at the moment!  It's BYOB which you can't beat.  Never had a bad dish here!"}
{"text":"The best Hong Kong/Cantonese restaurant in town! Me and my girlfriend had lunch here this afternoon. We ordered 3 dishes from the lunch special menu. The price is good with overwhelming amount of food coming out. We had a friend who comes late and ordered one more fried rice, eventually we cant finish all of the fired rice (as we were eating the steamed rice before he arrive), but we finished all others. It was delicious and really taste like those I had in Hong Kong.

Service was good too. We were seated as soon as we arrived. Food come out in a reasonable time. And throughout the meal, we had couple server come check our table. Whenever we need somethings, they just serve right away.

Good food and good service, definitely will come back again!!"}
