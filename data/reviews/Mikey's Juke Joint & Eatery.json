{"text":"Wow what a great PO BOY taco 
Nice size shrimp great flavor with a little heat... Live music can't ask for anything more"}
{"text":"Mikey's was wonderful, went with a large group to check out the open jam Saturday PM. Though there was only one server at the start of the afternoon, she was still very helpful and on top of it (thanks Debbie:)). Soon there were staff all of which were freindly. They have my fav, Wild Rose on tap, not jsut brown, but IPA, and Velvet fog and others. Also lots of other great beers. We had appies all of which were tasty. Oh and the music!! The jam was unbelievable, great music, great crowd, the tiny space in front of the band, did not stop us and lots of others from dacing like crazy. Soo much fun, will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"Went here a while back for a live show and fell in love. 

Great food, great ambience and they get AMAZING acts.

Service is SLOW, but it's good - the staff are really friendly and nice, even if it takes forever to get the food, which IS worth the wait - I really enjoyed my meal. 

It's a bit rough around the edges, but that's the way a blues bar should be - it should feel 'real' and a little 'pre-loved' vs all clean and shiny and modern with everything metal. There's a teeny tiny dance floor (just enough room for 3 couples) if the music inspires you to get up & move. 

I also loved how, towards the end of the night, you could just curl up in a booth (no getting yelled at for having my sock wearing feet up on the banquet) and listen to the music as it got increasingly mellow in there. Just the right feel for a blues bar. 

One thing to keep in mind is that if you're going there for a show (especially if it's for a popular act) it gets jam-packed HOURS in advance. Be there at least 2 hours before the show if you want to get a table (we only managed to get seats by convincing some people to let us share their table)."}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service experience I have ever encountered. The rude waitress asked us to \"get our stuff out of the way\" to put the food down, when we told her the tacos were cold she grabbed the plate and swung into the kitchen without saying a word. We had to flag her down to ask if they were being remade as she had said nothing about it, and she said she wasn't \"holding the tacos hostage\" and laughed in our faces. We asked to see manager, she said \"we are all
Managers\" but sent over her friend, the bartender. Who then explained the meat in tacos is always served cold. We told her we didnt want them any more, as we were so uncomfortable being there and another hastily grabbed plate was removed. We asked for our bill right away and she charged us for the tacos we never even touched, and we explained we weren't paying for something we never ate, she refused to take it off saying \"we only take things off of bills for
Customers who try the food first\" and finally she took it off \"explaining it was just this once\" then I asked her for her name, and she responded with \"what's your name?\" Horrifying customer service, first night in Calgary fromvancouver too so it was a sour taste of the city. Don't eat here unless you want to be patronized"}
{"text":"Patio happy hour! I was looking for a patio near my friend's place for some after work drinks in the sunshine, and Yelp suggested Mikey's. I've been here before for a late night gig but was a little hazy on the patio situation so I messaged the business through Facebook and they replied within a few hours (once they opened) to confirm that they have a great patio and happy hour deals on local beers.

The low-down on happy hour: from 4pm - 7pm domestic pints (mainly Wild Rose plus the Last Best Dirty Bird) are from $5 (usually $7). My WR IPA and LB DB were both $5.50. There's also specials on domestic bottles (from $4.75), although this range was much less exciting, and $4.80 highballs. Tuesdays currently has ribs for $6 (usually $11) in a bunch of different flavours, and their Facebook regularly mentions their $5 wings on Fridays.

The patio is east-facing, so when we arrived at 6pm the direct sunlight was just disappearing, but it'd be a great spot earlier in the day, or if there's anyone out there that doesn't want warm and magical sunshine on their skin. It's not a huge patio (maybe 8 - 10 tables each seating about 4 people?) but there was still a table or two free when we arrived and it was a pretty chilled out atmosphere, easy to chat and catch up as the live music didn't start until later. Service was also good, nothing to write home about but attentive and some good suggestions for rib flavours."}
{"text":"On average, it probably isn't a good idea to make spontaneous decisions after a fourth pint of beer. We likely all have stories about forgettable thought processes under the influence deep in our closets somewhere.

So when a friend convinced me to go see a band called Monkey Junk at a place called Mikey's Juke Joint, I was afraid it might be one of those bad decisions. And though it hurt the next day at work, I am pleased to report that Mikey's is a decent place. 

The stage and dance floor are kind of small. However, they have a good selection of beer. A draft of Wild Rose will set you back $6.50. It also helps that they have a super cool bartender named Jen who actually helped us into a cab after we were stumbling into the street. 

The gig was lots of fun even though the cover was a pricey $20. I wouldn't say MJJ is a place that would blow you away or is anything out of the ordinary, but it has a really down-to-earth atmosphere with really cool normal people. 

Normally this would be a 3.5 star place on my scale, but I think I will round up for this one because it has a lot of character ... and that should be worth something."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but the food is terrible. The cheese burger is literally a piece of meat and slice of cheese between two buns. 

$10 for something that's below even McDonald's standards? Try again."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to a place like this.  A place the locals go.  Superlaid back. We got there before the band played anda bout 15 min late a guy comes around the table and bars to collect the cover charge.
Staff is friendly and the locals a little crazy but well behaved. If you want to dance to funky beat, there is a small dance floor, but ti works.
Best part the band that was playing had written a song about coming to California.. Awesome..
Come early, not a lot of seating as it fills up fast, definitley off the beaten path."}
{"text":"It's a dive bar that plays good music.  Don't expect working toilets or fancy food and you will be fine.  It is a locals watering hole with a great cozy atmosphere!  The wings are great and come with carrots and celery.  Daily beer specials.  Amazing posters on the walls throughout.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Mikey's ain't a 5 star - but it's certainly my new local watering hole and I'm guaranteed to be entertained and well-watered with Wild Rose beer every time we go. 

Whether it's one of the many great live music acts they have (seven nights a week!) or over hearing a 55+ year old drunk woman punching her upper thighs, saying: \"What's This? ....I'm beating around the bush!\" ...Mikey's is a place that's not about class -  but all about fun. 

It's kind of a mashup of Cheers meets a honkey tonk roadside blues bar.... The regulars are older, seasoned drinkers, haggard party-ers and veteran musicians. 

Leave your ego at the door, and prepare to cozy up next to strangers and settle in for a few hours for a good time."}
{"text":"I think I'm going to start on a new adventure, in discovering Calgary's local music scene. Really, the only places I've been to were the most commonly known venues such as Broken City, Republik, McEwan Hall,and some other place that I  can't bother to remember...

We stumbled into here after the Blues Can was at capacity and a charming lady advised good music was to be found here. So on a thursday night we came and paid the $10 cover at the request of one of the nicest doormen I've met. And inside was literally a place built to be the local pub you can't help but go to every night, I think I've found the Cheers of Calgary.

The performance room is quite intimate, small, but it allows everyone to to share tables and open up to conversation with each other. Their service was also great, we had Penny-who is probably one of the sweetest gals in the joint.

Also their posters are on lend apparently from some eccentric collector, and any music buff can spend the whole night digesting all the cool pictures."}
{"text":"I love the burrito and fish tacos at Mikey's. The fish tacos are particularly amazing. Enough fish to get a good chunk in each bite. The tortilla has grill marks and taste faintly of charcoal. The fish is lightly battered, beautifully spiced and tender. Extra points for the lovely garnishes. 3 tacos for $12 makes it a good deal too.

I have yet to try the wings, but I hear they are extra big and crunchy. The crab cakes are nice and make for a light appy. Bang for your buck dish is the burrito with fries. Really well-made and flavourful burrito. The bean dip really elevates the burrito too."}
{"text":"Canadian food and music, and both have taken good swift kick of southern blues. Mikey's is a cool mix between that music bar I'd want to hang out at and that music bar my parents would want to hang out at. Any night at Mikey's,  you'll find about a 30 year age gap, but one thing's for sure - Everybody will be drunk and dancing. It's the kind of place you'll find a host of regulars. Come as you are and let loose without feeling like you need to impress anyone. The place is pretty small but that just helps give it a great local pub feel, almost like you're just hanging out at your buddy's house for jam night, but the musician is one of the best in Canada.

The food has always been worth ordering. It's pub grub made in house with a southern flare.

If you can catch a rockabilly show at Mikey's, DO IT. These are a greasin' good time with the coolest most passionate fans you'll find anywhere."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through Skip the Dishes. I had the chicken sandwich and received a visually rotten piece of lettuce on the side. The sandwich itself was flavourless and fries were soggy (really soggy, not just from sitting in a delivery container for too long). My son got the pulled pork and it was full of gristle and he was gaging as trying to eat it.

I definitely do not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had a great afternoon hear listening to the jam - a lot of very talented musicians - while eating and drinking with friends.  Music was very good, mostly blues.  Food was good - try the chili/lime ribs.  Service was also very good.  Mikey's will be a regular stop for me when I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Best Canadian effort I've seen at Cajun or Tex-Mex. Burrito, salsa and fish tacos were all great. Must try the jalapeño poppers and sweet potato fries, though I wasn't a fan of the fry sauce. I would add a little kick to that mayo. Regularly have live music, blues to rockabilly, but be prepared for the cover. Do carry decent ciders for those with gluten concerns."}
{"text":"Though I have not personally been around for the live music, I hear some pretty great things about it. Judging by the posters of many musicians surrounding the walls, I can only assume that there are a variety of genres performing at this joint. I personally enjoy the motown posters. Mikey's has a really rugged feel to it. It gives off a vibe of one of those random bars you stumble upon during a long drive.

As for food, I usually order wings because that is just my preference. I always crave wings! Can't complain, they are pretty big! As for the service, I have only had one negative experience with a young worker who decided to offer a drink of water after 15 minutes of sitting down in a practically empty bar. After receiving our drinks, long story short, it got to the point where I had to wave her down, and she saw, but failed to move from her post and continued on with her conversation as she leaned over the bar counter. Other than that one person, the staff seems great and upbeat."}
{"text":"Shittiest service in town. This is with an empty bar and an arrogantly oblivious female server. Cold eggs Benedict is disgusting. 

I recommended mikes and ultimately 50 mins later we were all disappointed. I never tipped For the first time ever!

Staff is too comfortable and picks favourites."}
{"text":"Great place for live music and good well priced food. I got there at 2:30 pm on a Saturday and the band was getting setup. When they started it was slowly building up from slow funky blues up to rock & roll and other genres that kept the audience engaged and happy. I had the chorizo potato soup and was really good."}
{"text":"I drive by Mikey's every time I take 11th Ave SW to get to Crowchild. I always though it was a bit of a random spot for a pub, and each drive by was a reminder that I wanted to check it out. So when one of my friends said she'd be playing there, I knew the Fates were telling me it was time for a visit.

Mikey's isn't very big, I think 30 people would fill up all of the tables in the front half of the bar. A few more can fill the area with the pool table in the back. The walls are a feast for your eyes with old posters and memorabilia. See if you can spot the record peeking out from behind one of the pictures above the bar.

I was more than happy to hear there was some Velvet Fog on tap from the Wild Rose Brewery. I checked out the food menu and found myself drawn to the sandwiches, burgers and po'boys section. What's a po'boy? Turns out it's a sub sandwich from down south. Fitting for the theme of the bar. I ordered myself a beer battered shrimp po'boy (battered shrimp with remoulade, sliced tomatoes and romaine hearts on toasted filone). Deep fried shrimp on toast bread. I enjoyed it, but it was a lot of bread on bread. I was pleasantly intrigued by the coleslaw that came with it though! Well done Mikey's. It had a bit of a zip, wasn't too creamy... there are so many ways to do coleslaw wrong, thank you for finding a way to do it right. My side of red curry soup was also pretty tasty. All for just shy of 12 bones.

With some kind of music happening every night of the week, I'm sure I'll find my way back this way again soon.

Note: There may be a cover charge... depending on who's playing you're probably looking at $5 or $10."}
{"text":"I usually never write Yelp reviews unless I had an incredible or a horrible experience...

I was recommended this place and decided to place a $41 order. The hot wings were horrible - no sauce, no real buffalo flavor, just heavily deep fried. The Chicken Club - felt like I bought a sandwich from 7/11. I also tried their churro's which were so undercooked I had to throw them away... Very very disappointed as I had heard good things. 

Step your game up Mikey."}
{"text":"I work by Mikey's. I was overjoyed to discover a pub within walking distance of my office. That said, this place is sort of like that ex-girlfriend you wished would have worked out. 

When you imagine it in your mind, you think of all the good things, the wonderful times and the memories. But when you actually see it and go there again, the shine is off. That's not to say Mikey's isn't a good time - it is. It's just not spectacular.

Think \"friendly community pub\", and you're on the right track. Add in the blues, and you're pretty much there. It's a good place for a pint. It's a decent place for a meal. You won't be let down if you go in expecting nothing but those two things.

I've been here for lunches and dinners. Service is usually pretty good, though the odd time your beverages disappear into the great beyond. But oddly, they only have one server working the busy lunch hour. That might've made sense before the transit construction started, but now this place can fill up with hungry construction workers and it'd be good to have another pair of hands helping out.

That said, staff is friendly and apologetic any time something goes amiss. The atmosphere is fun and casual - I've had a few great little conversations with the easy-going staff.

Live shows are a great thing to take a date to, provided your date doesn't mind being surrounded by older people and has a healthy enjoyment of the blues. Oh, and it'll be loud in there. But seriously, some strong talent in here.

I always order one of two things: the chicken sandwich or the burger. I've sampled the dry ribs - they're good, but nothing amazing. Some of their dishes like the calamari salad are excellent, so don't be afraid to be a little adventurous. 

It's no 5-star establishment by any means. It'd be a 4 star if the service was always up to snuff. But it's friendly, it's a good watering hole and if you find the beltline packed out, it's worth rolling the dice on for an uncrowded brew."}
{"text":"PROS:
The food is amazing, the atmosphere is interesting and they play live music. I love the New Orleans feel - definitely a delicious dive kind of place. Street parking is free for 2 hours and it's just on the edge of downtown

The Memphis Pulled Pork Sandwich sets the bar for the BEST I pulled pork I have every had. Nothing on the menu has ever disappointed me. 

I have been there once in the evening, where they have local talent playing live music. If you love music and don't mind a \"rugged\" crowd, check it out.

CONS:
Their service is ALWAYS slow (at least during the day when they have one person working), so just give yourself extra time. They are friendly and good there, but it's just not fast to get served or pay.  

Great little spot for lunch & well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time recently and strictly for the entertainment.  The 3 piece blues band was awesome.  Despite sitting center stage, the music wasn't so loud that I couldn't have a conversation.  

It's a cozy, old venue and well decorated for its purpose.  The crowd was diverse but respectable, so no issues there.  Good people watching and lots to look at.  It was great that they turned off some TV's when the band started.

Drinks aren't outrageously priced and that's all I had.  This isn't a place I'd be inclined to order food.  Our server was on the ball unless I wanted something free, like water.  She was nice enough, though.   

I'd totally go back for more music and beer."}
{"text":"I've only ever had Mikey's during the week at lunch.  Odd? Perhaps, but it's walking distance from my office and sometime you need a beer at lunch.  Am I right?

I want to give it 4 stars but I can't do it....yet.  It's a little too inconsistent in terms of food and service to warrant a solid 4 stars, but it does have potential.

Things they are good at:
Deep frying.  Anything I've ever had that was deep fried from this place is good.  The wings warrant special mention as they were huge and juicy.  However, the \"ranch\" that accompanies them is a watery blue cheese ranch - not my thing.  Dry ribs are also a winner.

Quesadillas.  Have had it twice and it's a solid quesadilla.

Serving drinks. 

Things they need to work on:
Speed of service.  One server for the entire lunch rush is painful.  I'm not sure if the kitchen is equally slow or if the time it takes to get my meal is because of the server.

Weird menu twists.  It seems like all sauces and dressings have some sort of unique twist.  Blue cheese ranch, I think the caesar salad dressing is made with dijon mustard or something else weird.  Not my deal.

I do enjoy the One Way board - a tally of all the drivers that go the wrong way down the street in front of the pub.  It's a solid place with no pretension and an excellent break from my office.

{"text":"Went last night - Texas Flood was playing. Band was ok but still had to pay $10 each for cover and standing room only. We left after one set disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a very unassuming looking place near the Sunalta train platform.  In a town generally devoid of live music, it was refreshing to have entertainment!  Our group really enjoyed themselves and everyone enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"My partner took me here on date night.  The live music was cosy and rockin and the food was pretty good too.  Bonus:  they serve beer from Wild Rose Brewery!  Patrons are eager to get up and dance and the beer and wine is a most reasonable price.  What a fun night out!"}
{"text":"love it! 

my new favourite Friday night hangout! the live music is awesome, the staff is awesome, the drinks are awesome! 

Super laid back and a great place to go when you want to get away from the downtown crowds. Not to say it isn't crowded in there, because it does get pretty packed, but it's a different kind of crowded...in a good way! 

I didn't try the food, but everything i saw coming out looked and smelled delicous. (*truth - i got pretty drunk by accident so i asked the bartender for some toast - and they made me some toast! and it was the best toast i've ever had!)"}
