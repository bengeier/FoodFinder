{"text":"Good food but horrible staff. We were 12 + people and the waiter put everything on one single bill for over $750, finished his shift and went home leaving all of us to sort it out. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area who also serve good food and know how to treat clients properly."}
{"text":"It's not bad, but it's very expensive for the quality you get (we paid  about 40-50$ per person). My salmon tartar had almost no taste and my grilled calamari were very salty, but at least it had some taste to it. A friend ordered the swordfish, but none of the things on the menu were there (caramelized onions, baby spinach, etc.) We haven't tried going to the \"fish market\" to have your choice prepared, so that might be better.

The waiter was friendly when he was with us, but that wasn't often... After ordering we never saw him again, it took me 15 min to see him to get more water and the drink he forgot to bring me."}
{"text":"The food and service are average but I enjoy their decor and environment. I had ordered fish of the day. The grilled trout was alright but rice and veggies were quite bland. My friend ordered grilled octopus, and she said it was good. Their fattoush salad was very flavourful and tasty."}
{"text":"I went with my family a few months ago. All their meals were good and I would give it a 4-star rating, but I ordered octopus and instead of bringing me balsamic vinegar they brought me soy sauce. It ruined the entire meal, so I told them to take it back and bring it back with vinegar...they brought it back with soy again. One mistake is acceptable, 2 is not."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, yum!


This high end restaurant is a good place to go when you want a good Mediterranean flair to your fish!  I was a guest where we mostly ate family style.

The restaurant is elegant place where the matire' d warmly greets you and brings you to you table immediately.  He spoke English gracefully,  not at all acting put upon to not speak French with you

We shared hummus, baba ghanoush a garden salad or two and an order of fattoush amongst ourselves w/ fried pita & fresh pita. I haven't

It was Wednesday when they make chicken soup.  You must order it.  It's the wholesome classic soup with perfect broth.

We almost all had striped bass, served whole on  a simple platter adorned only with fat lemon wedges; another had the salmon.  Delectable, delicate flakiness.  

If I could ever find it again, I will def come here!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it used to be good. Now for the last three times I've visited, our experience there was not pleasant. The portions are becoming smaller, less taste and the presentation is awful. For the price, you won't get quality neither taste. The service is nice and the place has a nice atmosphere. I wish they could fix the kitchen so I can come back and give it higher rating."}
{"text":"From the great staff to the amazing food, this restaurant is an amazing place to go to for a nice quiet dinner among family or friends. 
I would definitely suggest the seafood since it's their specialty, but the meat is amazing as well. The salads are fresh and tasty too. You haven't really enjoyed Lebanese cuisine and fresh seafood until you have eaten at La Sirene!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better restaurants I ate at during my visit to Montreal. They weren't kidding when they said the seafood is so fresh. I had the most amazing sea bass here. I loved the labneh. The octopus was good. The restaurant was clean, spacious. Even though the restaurant was packed, I could have a quiet conversation here without having to overhear my neighbors. They waitstaff was too busy too refill our waters at times. I would definitely recommend going here if you're having a seafood craving."}
{"text":"Wide selection of extremely fresh fish and fantastic service from the young Asian fellow. Even throws in authentic Arabic words.

I thjnk the fact the fiah market is attached to the restaurant thatbis always busy makes this place better than most fish markets because of the volumes they move. The snapper and stripped bass are a must."}
{"text":"Everything in this place is fresh. Went to the attached market and picked out our fish and just crushed it.

Quick service, fresh fish and great atmosphere. I'll be coming here again FO SHO"}
{"text":"The best seafood I have tested after lake como Italy and Rome Their Chilean sea bass is the best , grilled octopus is excellent , try their creme brûlée , yummy . 
The place is bit pricy but they serve fresh ingredients .Service could be better  , to match the food quality. I felt the servers are snob . Of course you will be proud of your quality but be professional about it not to brush off by saying these glasses are for white wine not for water as if he knows that the customers they donot know what is what !!! Come on have some respect. 
Good ambience, nice decor .  
After all that rude service still I recommended lots of my friend to go there , to try the food . Still I will come back to this location for their good good"}
{"text":"I think the previous reviews bring up some legitimate points. In my experience the service here was adequate but not warm or inviting. I debated writing anything about this restaurant because although the food was delicious I recognized that it might be the kind of aloof attitude that would turn people off and impact their experience. However, we enjoyed the food - which started with Babaganoush and Fattouch salad. There was a pleasant smokiness to the eggplant which was scooped up with crisp, toasted pita breads. It was both creamy and had chunks of eggplant, which are my favorite part. The salad was zesty and refreshing, and was a good foil to the fried Sea Bream that arrived later on. We also had the grilled octopus appetizer which was slightly charred and yet still mostly tender, with a lemon and olive oil drizzle. We managed to totally destroy the whole fish we picked out earlier and were filled to the brim by the end of the meal. Some rice came with the fish, but upon reflection we should have ordered grilled vegetables to lighten the meal. I would order every item again, and there were plenty of other tantalizing items on other tables. So brave the old-school waiters and do your thing, demolish some seafood, and then send me a shout-out."}
{"text":"I like this place so much next week will be my 3rd week in a row. I can't even begin to describe how fantastic the food is there. The hummus and fattoush salad are simply amazing. The octopus is grilled to perfection, the calamari and dipping sauce are great, the sauteed shrimp is great.... Every time we go we plan to eat a meal but we order to many appetizers that we can't eat a meal.  I also asked for a large fattoush salad to go and this is the only SMART place which puts the salad dressing and crispy pita bread separately for to go. This was a great surprise when I got to work and was expecting to eat a slightly soggy salad the next day. Everything was perfect! 

The first time we went the service was amazing. The second time we went the service was still great except for being greeted at the door by the owner. After waiting 3 minutes without being acknowledged the owner came out, proceeded to continue talking on his phone (loudly), spoke on his phone for a good minute before finally telling the person on the phone to hold, rested the phone on his shoulder while he asked how many we were. After we told him he put his phone back to his ear as he walked us to our table. I'm sorry, but that is just horrible. Put your personal call on hold, seat your customers, and then go back to the telephone."}
{"text":"My employer often takes us to La Sirène for our Christmas time office diner. He goes there often with his wife as well.

I must say, I'm very open minded food wise, so I'm willing to try many different things, and this restaurant doesn't disapoint! I've enjoyed their food immensely, especially the grilled octopus. Of course, being a large group, we get to sample many of their selection of appetizers, which they are all great.

If you're a fish fan, La Sirène is the perfect place for you! You can go in the \"poissonnerie\" and chose your fish or lobster.

Its a bit pricey for me, but I really enjoy it whenever I go with the office!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night (Saturday July16, 2016). dropped by day earlier, as was driving by. Was able to reserve for an early dinner on a Saturday night. 
Parking is easy - they have a lot.
Access is easy - no steps to climb (and issue for one member of our party)
Nice, brightly lit room, with white table cloths. Full windows overlooking Jean Talon. Have blinds which block the glare, but then they raise in the earlier evening.
Restaurant was full as we were leaving - looked like having good turnover of tables.
We were a party of four.
Split the lebanese salad and the hummus.Both were delish. Good salad, mint not overpowering the salad (which I have had some other places). Hummus was not the best I've ever had, but pretty good.
main courses:
Tuna was great.
Black cod also.
3rd main was a split of two appetizers - grilled octopus and grilled shrimp. both were very very tasty.
last main was steak - while good, not great.... but what would you expect in a fish restaurant?
Service was quick and prompt and move everything along.
Would definitely return - not inexpensive, but not crazy prices."}
{"text":"The place was so bright and perfect the kebbeh was good i had the salmon it was grilled perfectly our host was really friendly and thoughtfull. I was an amazing experience :) i highly recommand ."}
{"text":"Excellent fish and lebanese restaurant. Wheter you are in the mood for a good Shish taouk, a fattoush or the freshest fish in town you will enjoy your experience.
If you decide to go for a fish, the waiter will take you in the market area, where you will be able to select your fish from a huge variety, then you choose the cooking, (grilled, fried, broiled.)
I chose a seabass and asked to have it grilled,  i then returned to my table and my appetizer started to arrive.... (Octopus salad cheese rolls, and a tabboule salad). Everything was so fresh and tasty .
If you are in the mood for fish, its the place to go ."}
{"text":"A group of us came here and couldn't figure out the menu (no, the waiters didn't bother to introduce the menu to us). But that was fine, because we decided to just have three red snappers to share between the nine of us, instead of ordering from the menu. We selected the three of the larger red snappers from the poissonerie and asked that they be grilled, with just olive oil and a touch of salt / pepper. 

Boy it was worth the non-existent service. 

The red snappers were fresh, succulent, and grilled to tasty perfection. It was singularly the most satisfying fish dinner I've had. 

So fresh grilled fish: 5 stars. 

Service: maybe 2.5 stars (but it appears that the servers were more attentive to some tables - probably those were regular clients).

Overall: I would still give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Having checked out the reviews before going here for my staff supper, I was walking in expecting to not be a fan. 

As mentioned by others, the service itself left something to be desired. We stood at the door waiting to be seated while the staff (bartender, manager/maitre-d and waiters) all chatting among themselves even though we were clearly in their eye line. Even once seated, it was wordless service (corporate pre-selected menu, but still), and when staff dropped sauce on my chair it was only thanks to my own efforts that it was cleaned up.

Where they made up for it was the food. Everything from the salads to the fish was delicious. Fresh, balanced, light. Everything you look for in Mediterranean cuisine was without a doubt accounted for. Staff were quick to fill our wine glasses during the start of the meal however once the main dishes started to come out, they never returned their attention to our glasses.

The washrooms were nice, clean. They have a coat room that they failed to mention to the majority of our staff. There was ample parking on both sides of the building (restaurant and fish market). 

I can't personally justify their prices as their corporate menu would have been about $50-60/head + wine/tax/tip which I don't believe we received in equal value, but if you're not the type who cares about the cost so long as the food is good, you'd be pleased."}
{"text":"Worst place in town I would never recommended for anybody I can't believe I had to pay over 200$ for three people this is an outrage and a rip off don't go there if you want to go somewhere go to Moishes or Lucilles oyster Dive!!"}
{"text":"Sunday evening was my first time there. 
The food and staff were nothing short of fantastic. 
Do yourself a favour.....GO and you will thank yourself for trying it. 
Ps go for the fish soup and the grilled octopus."}
{"text":"The ambiance of the restaurant is quite nice when entering, but that was the only highlight of the evening. I went with high hopes into the restaurant hoping to treat my mother to a great meal for her birthday but that wasn't the case. Once we entered the restaurant, we waited for about 10 minutes to simply be greeted and seated at a table, and we had made reservations. Then, we were seated at a table that had not even been made when there were several more tables that were perfectly arranged and ready for customers. To put a cherry on top of it all, we had the most rude waiter I have ever encountered in my life. He constantly gave snarky and sarcastic comments whenever we would ask a question. We did not feel welcome in there. Given the largely white demographic, I'm not surprised we were treated differently. We were not even offered complimentary watermelon as everyone else (who were all white) was. Not to mention, the food was mediocre at best. Needless to say, I had a HORRENDOUS experience and will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Is it the freshest seafood around?  Yes
Is it the highest quality food?  Yes
Best tabule I ever tasted?  Yes
Octopus cooked to perfection?  Yes
Service great?  Yes
Is it a 5/5? Yes
Is it expensive?  Yes, but this is the best of the best and doesn't disappoint.  You are paying for the quality of ingredients and service

Well deserved and will be back"}
{"text":"The fish, the seafood, the hummus with meat and the salads are absolutely exquisite... very fresh and light. Some of their items are a little bland, mostly the side dishes and the meats. 

It's my go-to restaurant when I want a healthy meal, even if I end up eating way too much with the excuse that it's healthy. 

Usually service is very good and prices are very reasonable considering the high quality of the food."}
{"text":"The food was good but the poor service ruined the evening. We were a large group and it took 45 minutes to settle the bill since they grouped it all together. 30 minutes of that was past closing of the restaurant. Staff was barely apologetic and they did nothing to make us feel any better about the situation.  Since we were the only ones left in the restaurant, and commenting on the situation during our long wait, the staff was well aware of our frustration. NOTHING!!!"}
{"text":"Lebanese restaurant. Had supper here last night and everything was excellent. Started with  an appetizer of octopus which was just right, just the right amount of chewy, not rubbery. Followed up with the lamb chops and shrimp which were fresh and delicious. The seafood is probably so fresh because they also have a fish store on-site. All washed down with an excellent Syrah. Definitely an older clientele generally. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A little expensive, but excellent food in a nice ambiance.  I really enjoyed the high ceilings in the restaurant. My favorite part of the meal was the fattouche salad. It wasn't too salty or sour, just perfect. We tried the shish kebab filet mignon, the sea bass and the sole filet. The first two dishes were the best. The desserts were nice,  but not too memorable. We had gone with expectations of a very slow service, but it turned out that it was fairly fast despite the restaurant being full. I would return again. It also has a room in the back that could accommodate up to 20-25 people."}
{"text":"Mediterranean seefood, big parking, beautiful place, many windows, many tables, clean everywhere and good service, the food and price is just ok."}
