{"text":"Probably the best gas station in the world. That is all... OK, perhaps a quick mention about the incredible smell in this place and the novelty sweets!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Who would think  you can get very good southern food from a gas station in downtown Toronto?
Corn fritters are moist and delicate on the inside, crispy and golden on the outside, and served with a cilantro dip bursting with freshness. Smoked brisket sandwiches are juicy and offer complex flavours. Baked beans taste delightfully simple and bright. The Caesar salad is not remarkable, but the dressing is better than you find at most places. Did not try the chicken and waffles but certainly will on my next visit!
The interior has a charming old-fashioned convenience store vibe. Grab a glass bottle of Pepsi from the fridge while you wait for your order. Plenty of seating indoors, and outside on shaded picnic tables."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the fact this place is in a gas station. The pulled pork sandwich may have been the best pulled pork I've ever had! Everything was fresh (bun, meat, slaw).

Price range was a little high, $8.00 for a sandwich with no side is on the high side but hard to pass up such a great sandwich."}
{"text":"Surprisingly really really good! The pulled pork poutine is awesome and so is their Chicken and waffle sandwich! Definitely worth giving a try!"}
{"text":"Went in the other day after a hard days work for sandwiches for me and my compadre. For 2 sandwiches the final tab was $17! They were good but not good enough to warrant that price tag. 
They do have the cheapest gas in the area but if you pay cash make sure you get your change. Nasty habit of keeping a few cents. So what it's only a few cents but that's not a legit way to run a business."}
{"text":"For a Leslieviller this could be the place to stop by for a quick snack, Loved it at first but after trying almost everything on their menu, I feel like if everything taste the same. I will give the credit for making awesome sandwiches but I think that once month it's enough for me. The Putin it's ok but not wow great. Over all it's a cool spot to consider if you are in a rush and want a good snack, wish they could get the orders a bit quicker, last time I wated 20 min for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Go for the gas, stay for the sandwiches.

I've been here three times now.  Each time getting a different sandwich, and once getting their poutine.  The Staff are kind and talkative, the service is pretty quick, the prices are about right, and the quality is higher than one would expect.

The pulled-pork was tender, flavourful and tasty.  The beef brisket was one of the better sandwiches I've had in Toronto, and the poutine was decent, but not life changing.

I'd definitely recommend coming here for gas and a sandwich.  They've got better gas prices than Esso/Petro-can, etc, and you can put the savings towards getting a delicious sandwich to boot.

I've heard rumours that their in-house cornbread is off-the-hook.  It'll be next on my list of things to try."}
{"text":"one of the best poutines outside of Qu√©bec. 10$ though Jesus Murphy no fries and gravy should be that much. Guy had a good beard though."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

This isn't your average gas station. Leslieville Pumps is a gas station, convenience store and a BBQ joint all rolled into one. Given that its located inside the convenience store of a gas station, there isn't much in terms of atmosphere...but the food is fantastic and the prices won't break the bank. 

Although I came for lunch, Leslieville Pumps has a selection of mouth-watering breakfast sandwiches available in the AM. The kitchen is open from 6am to 8pm, Mondays to Fridays and 8am to 8pm on weekends. But if you're here for gas, they're open 24 hours.  

What went in my belly:

Southern Style Beef Brisket Sandwich - homemade BBQ sauce, crispy sweet onions and grainy mustard ($7.74). Unlike most brisket sandwiches I've had which contain slices of shaved meat, the sandwich here contained chunks. The brisket had a really nice smoky flavour to it and tasted incredible with the homemade BBQ sauce and grainy mustard. Overall, a killer brisket sandwich!

Hickory Smoked Chicken Thighs Sandwich - with grilled tomatoes, arugula and sweet-chili aioli ($7.74): Similar to the brisket, the chicken had an incredible smoky flavour to it. While I enjoyed the sandwich, I found it to be a touch on the dry side. I would have preferred more of the sweet-chili aioli on it. 

Corn Fritters ($3.99): I never would have ordered these if I hadn't heard such great things about them. One order consisted of five ridiculously delicious and addictive corn fritters. They were light and fluffy (unlike cornbread, which was what I was expecting) and came with a side of tasty creole dipping sauce. Highly recommended!

Fried Pickles ($3.99): The order came with 4 perfectly fried pickles which were some of the best I've had in a while. I just wish it came with a side of dipping sauce too. 

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by what this gas station/convenience store had to offer. The barbequed meat sandwiches were delicious as were the deep-fried sides. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had called in an order but when I got there the lady forgot to write down and send order to kitchen . At first I was pretty annoyed but she was apologetic. She gave me a free carrot muffin (have yet to eat it, but will tomorrow). I was so stuffed from the amazing food I had yet to try. Seriously, if you are in the mood for an awsome poutine I suggest their loaded poutine with bbq brisket.  It was the only thing I ate all day and it was beyond delish.  I only hope that said carrot muffin  is just as delicious, no wait.  I don't.  The poutine was great, nothing there can beat it! I will be def be back. Fries are fresh cut, gravy is homemade and awesome and the bbq brisket - out of words! Do it! Great customer service  skills. Just do it."}
{"text":"Breakfast tiime. After my first experience here i decided this morning to try the smoked salmon bagel. When I ordered they had at least 4 different types of bagels and a bunch of homemade cream cheeses. I went with the caper and dill cream cheese on an everything bagel with their house made smoked salmon, and slices red onion. This was fantastic! the smoked salmon was like nothing I ever had before, as i could taste the smoke and rum they used to cure it. So Good!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good here. Must tries are definitely the bacon corn fritters, beef brisket sandwich and pulled pork sandwich. Deep fried pickles are massive and very tasty as well.  Service is friendly and fast. Prices are all reasonable and affordable."}
{"text":"This place is so unassuming!  I've walked and driven by a million times and thought \"looks cool, but I'm not eating at a gas station\".  I feel like I've wasted precious moments of my life because of that.

When you go inside, it's like an old school (and very well maintained & clean) smokehouse/BBQ joint with cool stuff for kids too (candy, etc).  The menu was larger and more varied than I ever would have assumed.  

We had the weekend special and the brisket chili.  The special was chicken and waffles with poached pear.  It was served with an extra side of hot sauce and the waffles were made fresh to order.  Honestly, this dish made me believe in God.  It was so good!  The waffles were so puffy and sweet.  The chili was great too!  These guys do breakfast (all day), lunch, dinner, and they even have late night items.

I feel bad for ignoring this place for so long.  I will absolutely be back soon."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I waited till now, to try the recent upgraded, newly owned and re-named Leslieville Pumps gas station.  I think it's been about 3 months under the new management.  Pretty interesting combination of gas, lottery tickets and maps on one side with a food counter offering up \"low 'n slow\" pulled pork, brisket, poutine and more.  I've been twice and   am ready to attest to the most excellent brisket and pulled pork; enjoyed as much as The Stockards' offerings.  Loved the crispy fried onions topping the brisket.  The baked beans had perfect texture and richness, if a little on the sweet side.  And their \"real\" Caesar salad is pretty good, with greater depth of flavour than many, albeit a little on the small side.  The sandwiches were a healthy size.  Looking forward to eating through everything they have, as I'm just up the street and often in need of providing lunch for co-workers and clients."}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE! Mouth-watering deliciousness! It is by far the BEST Poutine in the city! And I love my poutine! I don't write this with an easy pleasing palette. I will make the mission to this place. Don't let the exterior aesthetic of the place deceive you. It's a Gem! I usually order the braised beef poutine. It's amazing. As well as their deep fried pickles. I've had the pulled pork too, also an excellent choice. A must check out. They have few tables inside, so probably best to plan for takeout."}
{"text":"Good but not great. 3.5 stars. 

Deep fried pickles are very good. Brisket chilli is watery, lacks depth of flavour and pretty lacklustre. Brisket sandwich is good but pretty sweet. Fries are great. 

It's also a bit pricey for what you get, but I go there a lot so it can't be so bad. 

Baked goods are fantastic,especially the apple turnover."}
{"text":"I've had the pulled pork, the brisket and the veg sandwiches on various occasions. I fined the pork and the brisket a tad on the sweet side. Sides are good and it's a good deal for tasty home cooking"}
{"text":"I come here at least twice a month for the Healthy Morning breakfast sandwich. It's easily the best healthy breakfast option in the area. Multigrain bread, avocado-tomatillo sauce, sprouts, egg whites and roasted peppers.
I've tried most of the lunch offerings as well and they're also excellent. Especially the pulled pork, the brisket and sides, including the fried pickles and the corn fritters.
The service is always very friendly, and if you call ahead, your food will be waiting for you."}
{"text":"The brisket and chicken sandwiches are very flavorful and do not disappoint. This is our go to sandwich shop. The coleslaw is great too. Love this place."}
{"text":"So yummy! loved the corn fritters and the beef brisket. and the decor is cosy."}
{"text":"Leslieville Pumps this morning proved to be one of the greatest culinary surprises EVER! I've lived in the area for a while now, but it was only when I was browsing on Yelp one day that I actually realised this place served food - up until then, I thought it was just a gas station/convenience store. So thanks, Yelpers, for enlightening me!

The staff were very chirpy and helpful, so much so that I gave a tip at the till despite it being essentially a fast-food diner type place (like most, I usually reserve tips for actual waiter service). There was plenty of choice on the menu, and my classic breakfast BLT-with-egg-bagel-type-thing was UNBELIEVABLE. Granted, it probably helped that I was ravenous when I arrived at the place, but the meal really was delicious.

Coffee was also really nice, and I liked how there was a Leslieville Pumps logo on the takeout cup - it's a cute touch I think when businesses have their own label on their take-out cups!

They also have the largest Hershey bars I've ever seen! Big plus!

I cannot wait to go back - and it's open 24 hours and serves curry after 9.30 pm! Major thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The gas is always cheaper than the surrounding stations. Good food and coffee and very friendly service."}
{"text":"......This review is for the food counter, not the self-serve gas station.....

Had a peameal bacon sandwich.  Holy crap was it ever good!  I think they put the whole sandwich into the smoker after they assembled it... not sure, but even the bread had a smokey taste.   Most people I know rave about the pulled pork...so I'll be back soon for one of those.

When I looked at the menu, the lady at the counter asked me what kind of meal I was looking for, and made a couple of recommendations.  One of the cooks even shouted something out of the kitchen.  Super friendly folks.  

Awesome smoked meat and BBQ at a gas station????   I thought I was in Texas!   How cool is it to be sitting at a small table eating awesome food at a gas station."}
{"text":"I love my neighborhood. You buy toiletries at THE Shoppers Drug Mart that Spike bought her pregnancy test from and then cross the road to eat a southern BBQ Style meal at a western themed gas station. The people that own this place are great and really friendly. They serve a beef, pork and chicken pulled style sandwich, poutine, fries and breakfast. 

We have been a couple of times and its good... just much too expensive for what you get. For about the same price you can get a phenomenal poutine that is twice the size at Great Burger Kitchen. Plus.. the poutine here is not good. Watery gravy and cheese that squeaks too much. 

Sandwiches are yummy (beef was much better than chicken) but for $8 a pop I'll pass. If they lowered them to $5, $6 or so, I think they would have much more business."}
{"text":"You certainly can't fault the food at Leslieville Pumps, it's very good. The prices however are too high. 

Keep in mind, this is not a typical restaurant. It's essentially a gourmet snack bar tucked in the back of gas station convenience mart. There is no table service and the ambiance despite being amazing for a gas station, doesn't compare to any of the dedicated eateries in the nearby area. 
And yet, you'll pay $11.50 (taxes in) for a turkey club without any sides like fries or chips. It's decently sized, made with chunks of turkey breast and thick-cut bacon, but basically it's just a sandwich wrapped in a foil wrapper. My expectation for a meal of this price is a lot higher. 
Other than price, I still recommend. They were friendly and it's clear they take their food seriously."}
{"text":"Terrific food, never disappoints, in  a most unique venue!"}
{"text":"A co-worker surprised me with a double decker, apple wood smoked cheddar on egg bread, grilled cheese from Leslieville Pumps. In a word - amazing. The best grilled cheese I've ever had, hands down. Can't wait to try the rest of their fare!"}
{"text":"I went in and ordered 3 sandwiches, came home to find the \"hipsters\" working only gave me 2 sandwiches.    

They really need to hire \"smarter\" staff there.  I won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars:
Stopped by for a bite around 6pm on a Friday night. It was pretty busy, but eventually got a table. There's only like 4 tables there so best to grab and go. It took 30 mins to get our food because they had forgotten to put the order in and we had to ask twice before they realized. It seemed like an uncommon mistake because the server gave us two brownies on the house and apologized for it. Great sandwiches and fries though. Would come back, but definitely get take out. I wanna try everything else."}
{"text":"I'm torn, really torn.  On one hand, the service is friendly in person, and the food is delicious. I loved my pulled pork sandwich, the cornbread was amazing, and I loved the baked beans.  

On the other, the bagels are pretty meh, but I'm kinda picky.  

What's really holding me back from four+ stars? Twice I've had an order ready for call ahead takeout, twice I've been put on hold for literally longer than 10 mins, and then given up. They don't even put you on actual hold, so you can listen longingly at people getting their sandwich on.  And then when you try to call back you get either a busy signal or a voicemail box that hasn't been set up. CAUSE THEY'VE STILL FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME.

Next time I finally get through, I'm getting a brisket sandwich. I'll report back."}
{"text":"It's like you're standing at 969 Queen Street and three alternate universes collide.  It's a western saloon, a gas station, and a southern bbq joint all in one!

Giddy up!  This place is awesome!!!  Fill up your gas tank and your stomach.
Aged wood everywhere and there's even some weird old dude leering at you from the porch!

Inside, it's a convenient store/kitchen with a small seating area (with about 4 tables that can seat 4-5 people each).  I perused the chips section while I waited for a table.  There was a steady stream of patrons, mostly for take-out.

When you are ready to order,  grab your drink and make your selection(s) from the the chalkboard.

*The corn fritters ($4) were golden crispy deep-fried nuggets with a few pieces of corn inside.  Served super hot from the deep fryer with green creole dipping sauce.  Sooo good!

*The deep fried pickles ($4) don't come with sauce.  The batter kept falling off the pickles. :(  More fritters, less pickles next time.

*Poutine was a good sized portion, lots of fries, dark gravy, and curds.  Be warned, the gravy is super salty, so you might want to grab a drink.  Poutine could have used more curds.

*The beef brisket was served on a kaiser with crispy onions (that didn't seem all that crispy).  Not as tender and saucy as the pulled pork.   I feel like it could have slow-cooked way longer.

*The pulled pork sandwich is the most popular sandwich here.  Smothered in southern BBQ sauce, soft and chewy, topped with slaw.  I preferred this sandwich over the brisket one by far.

The sandwiches aren't cheap for $8 dollars each.  But considering that gas station food is usually day-old hot dogs, those gross burrito-brick things, slushies, and mediocre coffee, I would love to stop here. 

I wish Leslieville Pumps was my neighborhood gas station.  Alright, now re-routing myself through Leslieville, so you might have to add +20 minutes to my arrival time. =D"}
{"text":"the brisket sand with the crispy onions is the best, would go for that from now on.  one star off for the rude women who works the gas bar."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. My first trip was a great 4 star experience. We showed up and chatted with the owner/chef, who was energetic and enthusiastic, and he helped me decide what to get. My meal was fantastic, and I loved the decor and atmosphere. I'd have to be pretty upset to drop my review down to one, right?

It's been over a month, maybe two, since my second visit, and I'm still upset about it. My girlfriend and I went in and ordered the same thing we did the first time. The lady at the cash had trouble with our clear and concise instruction, so we repeated and clarified our order two more times. 2 sandwiches, 2 drinks, 2 orders of fries. When our order came up, it was completely wrong. I had asked for my pulled pork without slaw, and it was covered in it. My first thought was that maybe I could just scoop it off, but there was so much of it and it was so mixed in with the pork that doing so would be impossible. 

My girlfriend, who had treated me that night, went back to get our order fixed. It took a few minutes for her to get any attention, and then she actually had to argue with the jerk behind the counter that anything about our order was wrong at all. In the end, my sandwich was replaced, but I'm always wary of sending food back, because we've all heard stories, especially when the staff starts off combative. We ended up short an order of fries. We apparently hadn't been charged for 2, despite repeating our order an infuriating number of times, and weren't about to give this place another penny.

If I had to describe this experience in one word, it'd be \"heartbreaking\". I thought we'd found a new place to eat near home, and I'd already sent friends there. None of us are going back now, and that's why I'm writing this review. If the owner is there, great. You'll have a great experience. If he's gone, just walk away. I don't think it's worth taking that chance, though. 

And to the owner, if he should read this: Tell me that jerk behind the counter got the axe and I will totally come back."}
{"text":"That place rocks. We took the street car from downtown on the way up. We were definitely going to grab a poutine. We've been told that it was one of the best in town, and it is! Their gravy is just so good. Thick and full of flavour. We walked our way back downtown after to burn the calories. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"At the risk of increasingly the lineups at this little place, I'll throw in my 2 cents about Leslieville pumps. First of all, I think it's the best pulled pork sandwich I've had in Toronto. The caesar salad is homemade. There's a wide range of things on the menu including chili and late night curry. It's all above average. Given the location and the paucity of lunch take-out places, this is all a very good thing. Service could be a little quicker. If you like baked goods, there is a also a great selection of homemade treats."}
{"text":"I had a ceasar salad $6.99 with added bacon $2 and chicken $6 for a total of $14.99.  Had a side of fries also.

A bunch of oversized chunks of tough romaine, maybe 1/2 a teaspoon of bacon, a piece of chicken drenched with a cheap bbq sauce - 1/3 the size of a hockey puck and some stale croutons that were like eating rocks.  None of the 'shaved real certified' parmesan that I could find.

The fries were half decent but it was just a tiny, tiny brown bag of them, like a literal handful.

Prices are super high and portions and quality are super low.

What an embarrassment to the area!"}
{"text":"Great! 

It's a gas station that serves great food and doesn't hesitate to experiment with unique and interesting fusions.

The price is right, you can walk in wearing sweats or whatever and the food is great.


Gas station food doesn't have to be bad.

Now if only the airlines could do the same!"}
{"text":"They have slightly redeemed themselves. I went late one night because I was hungry and expected the same limited crap they usually have only to find they now have a selection of salads available all  nicely chilled and ready to eat. Too bad they don't have a better description about the dressing etc... ... the attendant didn't have a clue about the dressings and their coffee still sucks however they nailed it in my opinion with these reasonably priced salads to go. 
This must be by accident and I can see them pulling it once they realize it is a good idea. I have no confidence in this place."}
{"text":"Bread was stale, found pieces of chunky cartilage in my chicken and the blonde chick at the counter was not pleasant in the least. Waste of time."}
{"text":"Does anyone else notice that there pastries and cinnamon buns are always harder then they should be.  Has anyone seen them stock fresh items. Disappointed so far.  Sandwiches were good during lunch hour rush but very slow service,  due to small kitchen"}
{"text":"Huge let down! For the wee bit of cheese on the supposed poutine is a joke! When I said how disappointed I was, I was told its portioned out. Please see my pic.

The server made a point of saying it's not her, I told her I know that, it's the kitchen. She asked if I wanted to lodge a complaint to the owner. I said not to bother. I'll write a review. Then some guy came over, he didn't identify himself by name or position. He gave me the speech about it being portioned out because of the costs of cheese. Like seriously?! 

Then he goes on about how such and such magazine rated them the best in the city! I said it was hard to believe after what I was served. He sarcastically asks me if I know how the restaurant and food business operate. Ya I do! 

I said: this is my first impression of this business after reading what I've read. This isn't poutine, this is a order of fries. And your charging $5 and change for it! Poutine is suppose to be oozing with cheese. There's barely any cheese. He said I could pay for extra cheese. He did offer to get me more cheese and I said not to bother as I had asked for well done fries and these aren't well done. He offered me a deep fried pickle and something else. Then says: well I tried to offer you something. 

I asked him if he's ever been excited about a meal then been let down. He just looked at me. I said there's nothing that you can do to make up for a bad first impression. And if that is their standard for poutine I know to NOT come back here. And cheddar is not listed on the menu board. Whether it's Quebec or Ontario curds, traditional poutine does not have cheddar. List that so I can make an educated choice.

He then asked about the Butter Chicken sandwich I had. It was different but alright. Well I tried he says. (Passive aggressive sarcasm much?!)

Try this: offer a $5 or $10 voucher to the customer to get them to come back. Maybe the second impression will be better. Like when you decide to add more cheese to your poutine! 

All this because a client asked me where the best poutine is! Wait until I tell him the magazine was way off!"}
{"text":"holy charming yumminess, batman!

Get everything on the menu. Like EVERYTHING.  especially the pulled pork.  But ESPECIALLY the cod fritters.  

This is possibly the most charming setup for takeout ever.  It's the perfect place to recreate a small town gas-stop diner experience and a much better gas station stop than 100% of the gas stations I've been to.

A+"}
{"text":"Bad poutine.  I read a great review about their poutine and was excited.  Just got home with it after a 3 minute drive.  Fries were barely cooked, super mushy, they use what seems to be cheddar and mozzerela, and barely any gravy.  Super disappointing.  Zero flavour."}
{"text":"Keeping it old school, I cant believe this place exists in Toronto. I saw them on the Global Morning Show and had to see what this place is all about. 

When I entered the store I saw one of the owners from the show walking out and he gave me a quick hello and thanked me for coming in. I went to the food counter and grab a menu. As I was deciding on what to order I heard some people talking about how good the brisket was on the poutine. This defiantly helps me decide on my order.

When I talked to the girl at the front cash on what she would recommend, she said the brisket, baked beans and some corn bread.  I went with her suggestion and it was bang on. 

This has to be the coolest place in the east end."}
{"text":"Did you know they cater? Well they will not deliver but having an office party? They will do individual large orders. 

But they need 48hrs notice in an email. However they graciously accepted my order only the day beofre. 

About 10 people they were really well organized and packed up individual lunches exactly to order with no mistakes. It was ready to be picked up when they said it will and everything was delicious. 

Entire office enjoyed it and so many compliments good thing I had grabbed a bunch of menus. 

Great idea if yours close by and looking for something different for your team lunch."}
{"text":"Leslieville pumps is a gas station  that also double at sandwich shop.  This was my third stop through my crawl of Lesliville/east york 

I had beef brisket sandwich which was pretty tastey, their bbq sauce was amazing I felt the sandwich could been bigger but it's what it is. I have to try more they have pretty wide menu

There are about 3 table inside and 3 outside for seating but I won't count on it"}
{"text":"I had read about the brisket sandwich and was looking forward to visiting this spot on Queen... Parking out front was a bonus and service was very courteous. The price for a single sandwich came up to over 9 dollars, and although tasty with a nice Dijon,  the overall weight of the sandwich really left me wanting more. 

This seems to happen all to often with hot spots that cater to a hipster crowd... Once a reputation is established, the accounting takes over and owners lose what got them to the top in the first place - satisfying customers.  The cloud of profits and expansion takes over....

Not enough meat on the sandwich for 9 dollars. That is my review.  I would give more stars if the sandwich had more meat or was cheaper...."}

{"text":"I really hate to take away two stars from my review, but it takes only one bad experience to sully a once enjoyed restaurant for me.

We decided to stop into the Pumps after running some errands in the area.

I started by ordering a pulled pork sandwich for my boyfriend, without the coleslaw.  After confirming that I wanted just the pulled pork on a bun (NO COLESLAW) she rang the sandwich in and gave me my total.  I kind of hate when people assume you've finished your order (especially when there are two of us standing there), but I told her I wanted more and ordered fries to go with the sandwich.  Then I ordered the BLT for myself with another order of fries.  Two drinks from a nearby cooler brought the total to about $22.

In about 5 minutes our food was served.  Alas, the pulled pork sandwich came loaded with coleslaw and we only got one set of fries.

I took the sandwich to the front and told her that it was made incorrectly, and she argued with me for a bit.  After informing her that I told her twice that we wanted it without the coleslaw she finally sent it back to be fixed.  Then I told her that I ordered two sets of fries and she said she only charged me for one.  After reprinting my receipt it confirmed that she didn't listen when I placed my order and only rang up one set of fries.  For those keeping score at home this means that two sandwiches, an order of fries and two drinks cost me $22.  Yikes.

Despite my insistence that she should have listened better when I very clearly placed the order, she wasn't going to relent on another order of fries to appease us.  Once our replacement sandwich arrived, we quickly ate and got out of there, and probably won't be back.

This is a HUGE disappointment.  The first time we went in the owner spoke passionately about his food and his business.  This time we saw him leaving as we walked in and without his guiding presence it felt like the whole place fell apart.  I don't know if having him present would have made a difference, but I'd like to think he wouldn't want to witness one of his employees imply that his customers were lying.

I'm really disappointed, because the food is legitimately good.  I just refuse to give my business to a place that can't take orders correctly, and will not go above and beyond to appease the customer when a mistake is made."}
{"text":"Sometimes things happen for a reason and you don't know why until you are in the middle of the reason why. We were supposed to have lunch elsewheres and it turned out they were closed for lunch. Craptastic what do we do now?!?!?! Well we glanced across the street and got our answer.

Yes it is part gas station, part general store, but more importantly a restaurant. Our order consisted of a pulled pork sandwhich and and order of poutine. There's not many tables to sit at so make yourself some new friends and share a table. Well thank gawd we shared a sandwhich because this was one BIG bad boy! And freaking delicious as hell. We'd never had poutine before and even if this is the worst (I doubt it) version ever it has made me a believer in all things doused in gravy. I only wished we had gotten extra curds...sigh.

I'm going to have to high tail it back asap and try more of what is on the menu!"}
{"text":"Leslieville Pumps is the Western-fronted gas station at Queen E and Carlaw Ave, BUT.....they're also now a sandwich shop/deli dishing up Southern BBQed sandwiches!!  I just enjoyed their pulled pork sandwich, which had smokey and tender pulled pork in a deliciously sweet BBQ sauce.  It was served on a nice sesame bun with some coleslaw (in the sandwich), which added a nice bit of crunch.  It was a very tasty treat.  My only gripe would be the price.  At $8, it's pretty pricey for a take-away sandwich, but I guess in-line with other options in the neighourhood.   I plan to go back to try their beef brisket sandwich, hickory chicken sandwich and corn bread.  If you're looking for Southern food or a quick takeaway meal, this should be on your list!!  Once I try the other offerings, I'll post an update. 

I should also mention that the gas in routinely 2-3 cents cheaper here than a branded (Shell, Esso, etc.) station, so I try to gas up here as much as possible.  The configuration of the pumps certainly leaves something to be desired, but I'll take it if I can save a couple bucks!"}
{"text":"Needing to gas while coming back from a business strategy meeting downtown, I had to just go to my favorite gas station.

You just have to have the curry. Made by a Sri Lankan lady who knows how to cook this up. Now I can't say the smoked beans make a great side dish but what the hay I can't resist.

The curry is a late night treat for the cabbies who gas up here often."}
{"text":"Great meat sandwiches - there is a veggie option. I go back all the time for the roasted corn salad. Super friendly staff. Tables inside and out. It can get very busy at lunch hour so ordering ahead by phone is advisable."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches for a solid price. The brisket was spot on. Great fries. I love the look and concept of the establishment as well. Next time I need to stop in for breakfast!

There's a patio for the warm times, but it would be nice if there was more seating inside. Not sure how they could do that."}
{"text":"They have the best prices gas in the city and a delicious sandwich bar to boot! I got the beef brisket sandwich and it is one of the best I've had in Toronto! This place is awesome and I will definitely be coming back here more often."}
{"text":"I can't believe the food that's can get from the gas station. Love their BBQ, corn bread and the late-night curry. Love it all."}
{"text":"Never expected this place to serve decent food! It really looks like a gas station and a convenient store. They've got about three tables (4 pp. each) inside and a couple of picnic tables outside (6ppl. each). This place can get really crowded during lunch hours! When we were there, all the tables were full and there were people constantly coming to grab food (good sign). Plenty of parking space, friendly service (not the quickest service though. We waited good 15min for two sandwiches. I guess because there were lots of customers).

Solid food (flavorful sauce, generous amount of meats, and great buns! nothing to complain). Each sandwich costs about $8 ~ $10, if I remember correctly. They have a variety of sandwiches to choose from (bbq menu and \"healthier\" sandwiches with fresh ingredients, poutine, drinks, and desserts). 

Overall, solid food! Will be back if I crave for a good sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place was around in the form of a rather plain looking gas station until they renovated it last year.

At first I thought they just slapped a new front onto this old gas station, but on closer inspection, they did much more!

The sandwiches are actually pretty good!  I like the Morning Classic  The Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket are also delicious.  If you're looking for a vegetarian option, the Healthy Morning is an excellent choice.  

The kitchen closes at around 8pm, I think.  Stay away from the options they provide after the kitchen is closed.  I had the Butter Chicken.  It tasted plain and there was barely any chicken in it.  It was also expensive for what I got.

There are a few tables to sit at inside.  There are also a few picnic tables out front.  One area for improvement would be to move the thing that they store their old grease in.  It's near the picnic tables.  I can smell it.  I'd prefer if they moved it to the back.  

The service is pleasant and the sandwiches are ready in a reasonable amount of time.  I think that on average, the prices are fair.

Some people call this place amazing.  Leslieville Pumps themselves called their Pulled Pork \"famous\".   I wouldn't go that far, but it is a solid option for anyone looking for a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"Who knew a gas station could produce some really good BBQ?!!

I decided to stop by on my way home from work one evening.  I had a tankering for poutine and had been wanting to try this place for awhile.  I decided upon the Loaded Poutine with Beef Brisket.  Man, was I ever surprised.  The box had some serious weight to it, so I knew I was in for something good.  The box was filled to the brim!  Perfect amount of fries, brisket and real cheese curds (not shredded cheese like in some other reviews).  It was all smothered in a thick delicious gravy and steaming hot.  Perfect to melt the cheese to make it nice and gooey.  I'll definitely be returning again soon.

Bonus - you can buy your lottery tickets and pick up some snacks for later, while you wait!  Winner! Gagnons!"}
{"text":"Had the sandwich there.  Meh.  Nothing spectacular, especially at that price point.  Move on.  Would rarely repeat."}
{"text":"updated Review:

so i haven't been going to The Pumps all that much since i reviewed back in 2013.  My work scheduled changed, and I didn't need to each lunch in the area that much anymore... and when i did, i chose to go to Jim's diner because i love their club sandwich.
Sadly because of Jim's holiday schedule, today i decided to go to the Pumps. Such a disappointment.

I ordered the Oak Smoked Turkey Club.  I pulled up their website to be able to tell you all the specifications, but it's not listed on there... so i'll go by memory.

On this sandwich there is the turkey and bacon which is smothered in a sauce, then there is a pesto aioli, kale, and thyme tomatoes.

It's TOO MANY flavours to combine, and it all gets lost.  Whatever the sauce is on the turkey, it over powers the entire sandwich. You cannot taste the thyme of the tomatoes or the pesto aioli at all. The sauce on the turkey does not taste that good either. It's generic blah-ness.

After eating half the sandwich i had to take the meat off and just eat the bun with the tomato and aioli, and that was actually pretty good.  They are really great flavours, but they have zero clue how to combine these flavours to make really unique mind blowing sandwiches.  There is potential! Why do they have to put sooo much sauce on everything.  Not everything has to be like a pulled pork sandwich.  This sandwich would have been amazing with just regularly turkey, the pesto aioli, thyme tomatoes and regular bacon.  Maybe i'm too simple?  However, i'm confident that sometimes a simplified menu is better.

Then there was the price.  The sandwich is 8 something.  I also got fries and gravy.  The total was almost $17.  WTF?!?!  How much do fries and gravy cost?!?!  It wasn't like it's a big order of fries.  I can't imagine what the mark up must be on those products, because that is ridiculous.  I can get a massive Turkey Club, fries and a pop from Jim's for $12.  A meal that totally fills me up (my pumps lunch did not at all), and doesn't leave me having to pull the sandwich apart to be able to enjoy it.

This place is always busy and I'm convinced it's because of the novelty and a very select few of their menu items, like the Morning Classic breakfast sandwich and the pulled pork.  All their other sandwiches are disappointing.

Stop trying to create a menu that looks impressive when you read the descriptions, and start making quality products. You've got the quality ingredients (except that one sauce), you just have to figure out how to not over power everything.  The flavours should dance together, not be smothered and beat down."}
{"text":"Great food, espeically the sandwiches.  I'm not a fan of pickles but my friends couldn't stop talking about the fried pickles.

If you go after 8pm, their main kitchen is closed but the two Indian ladies who works there brings out their curry chicken with rice so I've picked up an order or two on my way home from work sometimes.  

For those who are complaining about the prices - tried a few doors over at a new joint called \"Poulette\" - then you will truly experience over-priced rip off.

At least I could say that at the end of the meal I'm absolutely stuffed.  Definitely can't be a place I visit every day or they would have to roll me out the door!

And love the gas station/ southern bbq concept!"}
{"text":"Leslieville Pumps doesn't just set the precedent of what a gentrified gas station is like, it is literally the fuel stop where everyone knows your name--cue in the Cheers theme song here. Unless of course you're literally like that awkward guy in that Chevy Cruze 'Gas Station' telly commercial, who nobody knows. Feel free to stop the soundtrack anytime now.

Bought by a couple of young guys from my understanding, this gas station has been done up to conform to a more hipster-esque taste, with its affinity towards vintage materialist nostalgia. On the surface, Leslieville Pumps is made to look like one of those kitschy roadside small town fuel stop/general stores you come across after a long drive (Young's General Store in Wawa, Ontario, comes to mind). If anything else, it gives my 'hood more of a charming village feeling rather than it being just another annexed (and gentrifying) Toronto community. Regardless, the Pumps attracts a varied clientele of all walks of life, from well-heeled neighbourhood foodies to late-night cabbies.

In terms of it being a \"general store,\" I've been to truck stops and small town gas station/general stores stocked with way more provisions than this middle-of-Toronto business. You'll find they have the basic variety store varieties that every gas station in town has: soda, chips, and the like.

Most folks who go here however, aren't here to fuel their cars nor stock up on nonexistent fishing gear. They come for their fresh cooked foods.

Unlike most other gas stations in the GTA, Leslieville Pumps is equipped with a kitchen (it used to be a Country Style coffee kiosk). They sell baked goods, but the kitchen is really there to pump out elevated gourmet comfort fuel for human stomachs that wouldn't be that much different from the stuff you'd find served at a truck stop. There are some tables inside for those who want to eat in, as well as a recently installed patio area, spruced up with shrubs and umbrellas to disguise the view otherwise of their fueling station and Queen East.

The kitchen is known to surprise many who don't expect much of gas station food. They have a reputation for pumping out some mean sandwiches. Their pulled pork sandwich is a screaming juicy monster to die for, I'll give'r that.

By contrast, they recently started offering fried chicken and waffles. And that turned out to be a boring  disappointment, as I stared and ate away a uninspiring slab of flat chicken and flabby waffles, accompanied by a pear-infused syrup that is heavy in spicy heat and pear flavours--probably the only gastronomic fun I got out of that order.

For what is basically glorified takeout fuel stop food, i find it quite pricey; you'll find yourself spending at least $10 per entr√©e. The service... meh. Yeah, you might get a hello and a smile, but you'll find the world-famous chattiness tend to be reserved for the recognised regulars, whom apparently are very numerous. Everyone else, including myself who rarely has a reason to stop here, may feel like the awkward guy in that Chevy ad. Yeah... and I live and grew up here?

Leslieville Pumps is for what it's worth, a very novel only-in-Leslieville business concept. Enjoy the stuff they post on the pumps though. East side, yo.

{"text":"We come here sometimes.  It's interesting to have a take out place in a gas station, but I guess it adds to the charm.  My bf will often order the breakfast sandwich and the beef brisket and we share.

They're both tasty.  Runour has it their corn fritter or corn slaw is to die for!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop by Leslieville pumps for quite some time now.... and why have been waiting this long? after all... it's just a walks away, super convenient, and accepts calls for take out!

Needing some grub while watching the NBA All Star game, my friends and I decided to finally check this place out..... between the three of us, we ordered the pulled pork, hickory chicken, and veginator sandwich.... corn fritters to share and poutine as well. At around 7:30pm, I was told to only have to wait 5 - 10 minutes before picking up (sweet!).

Upon opening the tin foil wrapped sandwiches, I was very pleased to see how big each creation was.... and yes the bun did take up a lot of that! All sandwiches were cut in half, and loaded with meat and veggies. The veginator, which I had was on a ciabata bun. Everyone seemed to be satisfied with their choices... although I was told that the chicken sandwich, was okay but had a nice barbeque flavour to it. The pulled pork was extremely filling with good sauce to meat content (from what I could see). I love portebello mushrooms so the veggie sandwich was perfect for me. Other veggies were not overly soggy and still had crunch, while the raw sprouts added a different texture to each bite. I liked the avocado cream spread on the bread... although I wish the ciabata bun wasn't so thick!

I was excited about the corn fritters and they did not disappoint. They were not heavy but rather fluffy, which I was surprised about - the green sauce it came with was tasty and had a garlic kick to it - beware of garlic breath the entire night!

Overall I was very happy with my meal... here's to more late night calls to Leslieville Pumps!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast sandwich!! I haven been eating here atleast 3-4 times a week. Cheaper gas also. One stop shop"}
{"text":"I've driven past Leslieville Pumps for years, I didn't realize it was a BBQ place as well. From the outside, this looks like an old school gas station. It is a functioning Gas Station and a delicious BBQ spot. Probably one of the coolest places in the City. 

I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich and a Poutine. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was good, a little bit too sweet for my taste buds but I still really enjoyed it. The Poutine was crazy good. The gravy had loads of flavor, the cheese curds were squeaky and the fries were so crispy. 

I would 100% come back. 

Keep Eating,
Angela"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for a place that looks like a gas station. Delicious smoked food for a good price! Yum."}
{"text":"A charming no-frills stop where you can grab a quick bite beside stands of snacks and old-fashioned gas pumps. Known for their sandwiches that they make in the back kitchen.

We had the pulled pork sandwich as a late dinner during a weekday. The space was pretty empty, with only two patrons strolling in to grab their own sandwiches. The bread was perfect buffer for the sizable slab of pulled pork sandwiched inside. Well seasoned, tender, warm and filling. It was the perfect snack to share or a simple dinner for one."}
{"text":"This is a 3 star bumped up to 4 star cuz the gas is 3 cents cheaper than most other gas stations, and the prices are reasonable. I'll be coming here for gas more often, and maybe a sandwich or some fritters.

Brisket: slightly sweet and tangy, but I had trouble tasting any smoke. Plus our sandwich was a little dry. Good thing for the...

Baked beans: which comes in a sweet and spicy sauce. I just dipped the sandwich in the beans to get some sauce and added moistness to help it go down easy.

Corn fritters w/ bacon: these could've used more bacon \"infusion\", but were still tasty w/ fresh corn niblets, and an herbaceous green dipping sauce (I'm guessing cilantro pesto, but I could be wrong). 

Cole slaw: crunchy and tart and a fresh complement to the brisket and beans."}
{"text":"Excellent food. BBQ is a must try. We had the hickory smoked chicken sandwich with chipotle aioli. Delish! And the  side coleslaw was amazing.  Can't wait to try more. 
Chill atmosphere. Takeout style. Lots of benches outside. It's just so cute!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Butter Chicken Sandwich and it was merely OK - not very much chicken for $8.75 and skimpy with the condiments.  The fries were very dry (we did not finish them) but the deep fried pickles were great.  We have had food from here on 3 occasions and this will be the last time."}
{"text":"Still my favourite gas station...

I come here quite often now, and it only gets better!  LP NEVER fails to make my day awesome!  Every time I walk in, I'm always greeted by friendly hellos and smiles!  I am also always tempted to get EVERYTHING listed on the chalkboard every time I come.

Chocolate croissant: $?? (5/5 stars)
The most GINORMOUS chocolate croissant ever with the most chocolate EVER! Seriously, it's like biting into a buttery and flakey pastry with a whole chocolate bar inside! It's AWESOME!!

Brisket Sandwich: $?? (4/5 stars)
slightly inconsistent, but still DELISH every single time.  One time I've had it, it was more shredded and had a LOT more sauce (my preference), but the next time I came, it was more chunks and drier.  Guess I'll just ask for more sauce next time.

Bacon-smoked Corn Fritters: $?? (5/5 stars)
Just like their regular corn fritters, but this time they are SMOKED!.... with BACON!! Need I tell you more?!?! Probably not, but I will... so fluffy, so smokey, so bacony, so corn(y?) all fried in a protective shell of golden perfection.  Oh,and whatever that pesto saucey goodness that comes on the side is...DIVINEEEEE!!!

Deep Fried Pickles: $3.99 (5/5 stars)
Okay, so on my last review I gave this a 3/5 because there was no dipping sauce.  Every time since, I have gotten the sauce... so maybe they just forgot the first time.  Yes, it merits the full 5 stars now!

You've also probably noticed I stopped noting or caring about the prices here.  Yea, 'cause I don't care anymore. For 2 people, it usually comes to $20 give or take.

They have a wonderful patio outside now where you can get all messy with the delicious gravy and pulled pork.  By \"patio\", I mean a few picnic benches outside... I don't care... I'd be happy sitting on the curb eating the food!  Then I think this aloud every time... \"Imagine if you served BEEEERRR..\""}
{"text":"Cheapest gas in the area - cheaper than No Frills on carlaw!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but it was most enchanting!

The gas, I've realized is quite decently priced and may actually be cheaper than some other places (at least it was that night).

But REALLY people go for the food.  I went there the other night with my father-in-law and husband.  The pulled pork sandwich was really good.  The bread was soft and fresh, and the coleslaw was just vinegary enough.  The pulled pork itself was sweet and tangy.  The beef brisket though was the sandwich I liked better.  it had fried onions on it and the same delicious bread.  The brisket was tender, smokey, and sweet.  We also topped it off with sharing poutine, which was made with local cheese curds.  My favourite poutine is at Poutini's but this comes a close second for sure!  Meaty fries, nice dark gravy and fresh cheese curds make a great traditional poutine.

Inside the station, it's really cute decor in an old-style general/gas station feel, and the tables had newspapers from the 1940's-60's.

We will definitely be going back, especially if we're feeling some barbeque and southern-style comfort food."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants. I've actually only ever had the pulled pork, but I keep ordering it because it's so good. I can't go to this place and not order it. The fries are also really good.

I only go to this place in warm weather when we can sit outside, but every time I'm in the area in the summer, we have to stop by."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich and wasn't bad the meat and sauce is pretty good but the bun has too much flour on the outside and too doughy."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches! Between $8-9/each. I had the BLT with home made pesto and thick cuts of turkey. I also had a bite of my friend's pulled pork which was also yummy. 

All day breakfast sandwiches too but I didn't try them."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich is terrible. They use way to much bun for my liking and it was old and dry.( you can see it in the pictures) . The pulled pork itself was lacking flavour and have non of that great smoked flavour. The bbq sauce was flat and no zest or heat.
I like to see love placed into my bbq and not just reheated from who knows when and slapped on a dry bun
I will give them props and say the deep fried pickles are great and so is the late night curry."}
{"text":"Great, open late for those long shifts.  Everything is good here but I could do without the cornbread muffins.  
The owners are great and have lived in Leslieville area their whole life."}
{"text":"The last couple of visits I've noticed a distinct drop in quality, which is why I've also dropped two stars from my review. There seems a little less care and attention to detail, both from the counter staff and the kitchen. On my last two visits, the buns that my sandwiches were made with were slightly stale. That's kind of a make-or-break detail - the turning point between a great sandwich and a very disappointing one. I'm hoping they can turn things around since I used to like this place."}
{"text":"For a gas station/ restaurant its a great surprise. 

The  Southern Style Beef Brisket was very good. From the bread to the meat. It was a bit surprise how good it was. 

The fries and bake beans made it even better.  One of the best place in Toronto to have southern style bbq.  Nice touch !!

Will be a regular at this joint.  Thanks again for some good/great food."}
{"text":"I do love Leslieville Pumps set up. 

The deco both inside and out does have this old time small town vibe. The days where the population of a small town would have come here for all their needs: gas, daily supplies, groceries and even a snack/meal/breakfast!

Southern Style Beef Brisket Sandwich ($7.74) and Corn Fritters ($3.99) both took quite awhile to be ready.. for sure is SLOW cook... How's the taste? Not bad, the beef brisket is quite tender and the home made BBQ sauce is tangy. however, the fritters tasted really bland.... 

Leslieville Pumps is a neat concept! But I don't think it worth a special trip to eat here. But do come and check it out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place where you cant judge by its decor, I go by this place everyday for work while on the 501 streetcar but not once did i think twice in going this place because of its modern out design. I had to stop by shoppers for some quick errands and knowing that i have a bit cash left over I decided to stop by for a quick bite.

The staff were very friendly and helpful as somehow they knew it was my first visit,  I was greeted immediately when I step foot inside. Im a huge poutine fan so I had to get the poutine when I saw it on their menu.

The fries were perfect to my standards, not under/over fried like some other places and they definitely did not cheap out on the gravy and cheese curds as it covered on top of my fries.

Ill definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Amazing & quick sandwiches and comfort food.  Proper buns and bread used and lots of bacon options.  Such a great neighborhood staple."}
{"text":"The best poutine i've had in toronto. ordered hickory smoked chicken poutine. Absolutely mouthwatering. Quick service, large portions, reasonable prices."}
