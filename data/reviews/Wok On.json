{"text":"This restaurant is inside of the AZ international Market Place.  You won't be able to find a sign outside until you enter the market.  At a glance, this place seems like a standard Panda Express/food court type of restaurant, but they actually have some pretty unique dishes that are made-to-order.

Here are the stuff I tried:

Chinese Dumpling - Better than the frozen ones I can find in Asian Markets.  I would definitely order this again.

Chinese Beef Noodle - Arguably the best in Arizona (not that we have many choices in AZ when it comes to this dish).

The prices are reasonable, and there are several items on the menu that I would try on my future visits.

The only problem I found so far is the seating.  There are about 4-6 seats available and it's really not a standard sit-down restaurant, but the food I want to order here are \"sit-down\" type of food.  Conflict of interest here.

I only tried this restaurant once and I usually don't give a 5-star rating unless I visit a restaurant for at least 3 times and see consistent quality in their food."}
{"text":"Its so surprising but I love this place. Its in a grocery store. The food is so authentic and flavorful. The portions are great and the price is right. It puts mall food and panda express to shame!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried everything here yet but I was pleasantly surprised to find Chinese style bbq pork here.  Both the bbq pork and the beef noodle soup are comfort foods I look forward to. On the two occasions I have visited,  the owners have kindly given us suggestions as to what they think is the tastiest and freshest from their menu. Definitely worth a try if you're interested in some Taiwanese/Chinese traditional food, and feel free to ask them what they would suggest.  

Looking forward to the next time I have beef noodle soup cravings."}
{"text":"Wok On is a quick serve Chinese take-away found inside the AZ International Marketplace grocery store.  Go in the front doors, make a right, just past iSnow Boba Tea, you'll find Wok On.

I've tried Wok On a twice since they have opened in early May '15, and the food was fresh, hot, of decent quality and, on one occasion, flavorful.  The options offered are a dozen or so hot entrées along with soup, egg rolls, pot stickers, Bazoi and crab won tons.  Advertised on the menu is a \"Bento Box\" which includes your choice of one, two or three entrée items along with a side item.  Side items include Chow (LoMein) Noodles, Taiwanese Rice Noodles, Fired Rice or vegetables.  However, Bento Box is a bit of a misnomer, it was not at all Japanese in style or content, rather it is a Styrofoam takeout box.  Also offered are a la carte entrées in large or small sizes.  

As with most new establishments, there are the usual kinks to work out in the first few weeks and Wok On is no exception.  The first time I ate here, the mushroom chicken was greasy and practically inedible.  The spicy pork was, well, like spicy pieces of chewy pork in an oily red sauce with an off, odd spice.  

However, on my second visit, the food looked visually more appealing and each offering was distinct in both flavor and texture.  One exception to this was the Ma Do Tofu, it was a bit soft to my liking, but it had a flavorful textured vegetarian protein component and was not overly salty like many Tofu dishes can be.  The Ma Do sauce showed restraint with both the soy sauce bottle and saltshaker and was balanced in spice and flavor.  The Broccoli Beef had nicely steamed broccoli but still had a bit of crunch to each piece, the beef was not too chewy, and again, showed restraint on the saltiness of the beef.  The Honey Garlic Chicken just shows that anything that is deep fried with a sweet and savory sauce is just delicious; add some chili oil for some heat and you've got plate-licking goodness.

Not offered on the hot buffet are made to order soups, pancakes, noodle dishes and typical American/Cantonese style food offerings with a few other dish styles thrown in such as Szechuan and Mongolian American styles.  These dishes can be ordered off the a la carte menu.  As of this review, there are only canned Coca-Cola beverages sold here.  Perhaps fountain soda drinks will be offered in the future because there are no other beverage choices besides bottled drinks, either in the grocery, the adjoining Mexican food eatery or the Boba Tea stand.  The beverage options are not the worst thing, but I see it is an opportunity lost, especially given the mixture of all the different businesses, under one roof.

The good thing about Wok On, and its adjacent ready-to-eat food offerings, is that it allows you to have a one-stop food satiation.  Get a bite to eat then go shopping for groceries . . . because shopping on an empty stomach is never a good idea for the waist or the wallet.

{"text":"Much to my surprise, I liked it.  At first glance it reminded me of Panda Express with less selection.  But then I realized there was a menu of items that were not displayed in the chafing dishes up-front.  A lot of choices there.  I ended up ordering the Szechuan pork which they cooked fresh on the spot.  So after about 10 minutes I had very hot and fresh food.

The portion size was generous.  Enough for two people if you include the rice.  Flavors were good, seasoning was good, vegetables had a light crunch to them.  Very well done, especially for a lunch counter in a grocery store.  This is not the Chinese food counter at some of the Basha's stores!!  Wok On is much better than that.

We will probably return relatively soon."}
{"text":"I like their food and they deliver to me without an intermediary. We usually get great service, our food delivery was delayed and delivered cold last time but they gave us a credit for our next delivery and it was perfect. Mistakes happen and they made theirs right so they are high on my call list!"}
{"text":"Great food!  The owner does the usual Americanized fare, but the real treat is the authentic dishes like tea smoked chicken.  If you want something authentic, just ask him, he will recommend something."}
{"text":"Despite the Panda Express style store front, the restaurant exceeded my expectations. Make sure to pay attention to the expanded menu that's not shown on the display boards. Pros include not having to pay tips and adding on your own snacks/drinks from the supermarket. Cons were the atmosphere and limited seating. We ordered:
- Beef Noodle Soup: very rich broth and good sized chunks of beef. However, I didn't expect the spiciness in my dish (chili oil?)
- Pork Chop Noodle Soup: a more clear broth reminiscent of wonton noodle soup broth. Pork chops were very tasty.
Both dishes don't have any MSG in them (am very sensitive to it and didn't detect any overwhelming salty taste in my mouth afterwards)
-1 star for the longer than average wait time"}
{"text":"I had the taiwanese beef noodle soup, pork chop noodle soup and potstickers. All were very tasty and a good price. Probably the only good taiwanese beef noodle soup ive had so far in AZ."}
