{"text":"Lol I feel bad for poor ol Citizen. This is a great spot for drinking, talking and dancing on Thurs through Sat. I always bring big groups here because it is hard to appease both club-goers and bar rats. This is a nice bar with a great dance floor. Not so douchey as clubs, and you can still have conversations."}
{"text":"The good: prompt response for a reservation, great wine, good atmosphere, good service (subject to what follows), good crowd and the food was okay.    Where the Citizen went wrong was at the end of the evening when we received our bill.  Our server told us at the beginning that she wouldn't be able to split the bill, so we were aware.  Fine, this is annoying, but we're all capable of figuring out the bill at the end of the night. When the bill arrived, it was wrong.  If there was one mistake, then we could overlook it and be fine, but there were multiple additions to our bill. Actually, $165 extra dollars worth of food put onto our bill.  We pointed it out to our server and she changed it right away and apologized, but how does that kind of a mistake happen? We literally had to go around our table with everyone checking off what they had so that we could see all the extras that were put onto the bill. If it is not possible to split a bill for a table, then at the VERY least, you have to make sure that it's right so that your customers don't have to go through it in painful detail.  One of my friends explained what happened to a manager at the front desk afterwards so that he was aware. Instead of listening to what the complaint was, he interrupted and told my friend that it was the gratuity charge built into the bill.   The Citizen is new and i'm sure it is still working out all of the kinks, but it is definitely going to have to work on the details (accurate bills) and the managerial service (at least pretend like you're listening and doing something about the issue). In an area where there are a hundred different options for food and drinks, the Citizen won't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE AFTER 10 PM.  I know you're thinking hey maybe it'll be different when I go BUT ITS NOT. The bouncers are absolute assholes, you will be waiting outside for at LEAST TWO HOURS. It's not worth it. Save your time and go somewhere else.  Plus I've been inside many times and it's overpriced and the staff is very choosy.   You've been warned."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and dancing with a big group.   Bartender was good, and drinks came quick.  Only bad thing was the DJ.  He played some good old school hits but didn't sound like he knew the songs he was playing.   Blending over lyrics (anthemic verses at that), mixing off key, train wreck blends, and just poor selection.  We made the most of it though.  A bit of a douchey crowd, but since we were in a group, we paid them no mind. I'd probably only go back if suggested for group event.  Otherwise..no."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday with a few close friends. First of all, i realized they lied when I had asked for a later reservation. Told me the only time they had was 6:30 so I booked it. Arrived being the ONLY party there.. The dinner food was disappointing. Prices were skyrocketing high but presentation & quality was NOT worth the price. We all felt ripped off. Around 10-11 was when they turned up the music really loud that you couldnt even be heard in conversation. The set-up of the place itself gets you impressed with it being nice & classy, but food & service really did not match that. Yes, i would still go back there cause theres good vibes for dancing & a couple drinks late at night, but I wouldnt get any food. I can see why it's an absolute hit for just dancing; the place was packed!"}
{"text":"This place has a cool vibe. Came here during the Raptors game recently and it was busy but not crammed like most bars downtown would be when showing the game. They have lots of tv screens all around the restaurant. The hostesses made it seem like we wouldn't get a seat without a reservation but there were a lot of empty tables, which remained empty for the majority of our stay so seems they can afford to be a little more accommodating by seating tables but maybe letting them know that they have only 2.5 hours until the next reservation!  The food was okay - nothing spectacular for the price. I did enjoy the poutine.    Would recommend coming here for a few drinks to watch a game with friends, but it doesn't have a super social vibe. On a Friday night around 11pm, it wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"Been here for drinks and dinner, but not late night which is apparently pretty good and happening. It's a large place (former Brant House) so easy to sit. For a sports bar, they don't have nearly as many TVs as many of the good sports bars downtown. Good drink selection. The food is fine, not really their speciality. I would go if you're looking for a bar in the area with a TV and lots to drink."}
{"text":"Waited in line forever not worth your time unless you know someone or are willing to pay extra to get inside. Once we got inside it was pretty good. Wouldn't go back there."}
{"text":"We read this had an older crowd on Fridays so decided to check it out.  10$ cover. Drinks are ok. Crowd is 20's and young 30's.  If you're over 35 don't bother.  Music is top 40's."}
{"text":"Douchebaggery at its finest.  If you're going here for dinner, not the worst place to eat. If you want to drink or have fun or actually get treated with any semblance of respect or appreciation for your business, go elsewhere.  Now I'm not saying everyone that goes to this hole is a douchebag, but a lot of them are and it feeds into the bloated sense of self-worth that's increasingly making Toronto a city of self-absorbed, under-achieving assholes.  That being said, the vast majority of the staff are total douchebags. If you want to go to a place where the staff acts better than you and acts like they're doing you the high privilege of serving you in their overrated watering hole, than this is for you. If not, look for one of the many other options in Toronto that actually has some character and decency to it."}
{"text":"If I could give this a zero star I would. Terrible service. The manager was even worst. I've never been to a place that had worst service than this. I will never be back and will never recommend this place to anyone. Please save your money and go else where. They really need to train their staff properly... such a waste of money!"}
{"text":"We came to Citizen to watch the Raptors game and would say that we were generally satisfied. Most of us ordered the citizen burger, which was excellent. The atmosphere was not the best place to watch a game but it's a decent after work lounge. However this place is on the pricey side, even for the area with lackluster service. Since its new I hope the service is as a result of working out some kinks. I would come back solely for the burger."}
{"text":"If you are just looking for a place to unwind and have a drink, then that is the place to go... the atmosphere is amazing, people are friendly, the music was excellent! Really enjoyed the Club!  I am definitely going back next time I am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday night just after 10pm, we got in without any issue or lineup.  Cover was $10 (which is reasonable) music was mostly throwback.  Drinks were cheap $8 glasses of wine or bar rail drinks, cocktails were $12 or so.  The crowd was a mix bag.  While I drank and danced until 1am I didn't feel like the music flowed that well or that the DJ was able to get everyone up and jumping.    Overall, great for cheap drinks, gets quite busy after 11pm but not really the dance-your-heart-out place."}
{"text":"Visited here with a few work colleagues. The food was okay. Chicken was a bit dry even though the soup was not bad. I would have given it a 4 because my colleagues said their chicken was good. I'm giving a 3 because I kept having to wait on the bartender for drinks - of the three times I went up I was never served promptly, and got passed over once. 4 star caliber but a 3 for now."}
{"text":"Cousin's bday soir√©e: Not sure how and why this place exists. Mediocre cocktail/drinks menu and food.   The only positive things are that the space is kinda nice with some rustic charm and staff are fairly helpful compared to similar establishments.  Repeat: No"}
{"text":"Came for a business event. This place appears to host many events of all sizes. Had a wide array of options you may choose for your event. The bartender are great with large array of drinks from bar rail to premium drinks.   Food selection seemed a bit salty. This may be due to the food choices.   The atmosphere is posh hipster, great for drinks"}
{"text":"We paid a good amount of money and rented out a booth area for a celebration. We all we went to check in our coats around 9pm. When we were ready to leave around 1am I went to coat check and they gave me my jacket but couldn't find my fur wrap/shawl. I waited for a bit and they told me to call the next day. They didn't open until Tuesday so I left a voicemail. I got a call today and was told they couldn't find my shawl and that I was pretty much SOL and there's nothing else they can do. I had just bought it for my birthday 2 days before and I'm pretty upset about it. You know you trust someone to take your coats/scarfs and keep it safe. Especially since we were encouraged to check our coats since a waiter said \"coats and scarfs disappear very fast around here\". Expected more out of a over priced King St. club/bar.  P.S. the birthday donut \"cake\" they brought out for my bday was absolutely disgusting. It tasted artificial and super dry."}
{"text":"Still a regular to Citizen, just love it as that casual not so pretentious place to go hang out and see friends.  The last year has seen me coming more on Thursdays than on the weekend.   Only thing I would say is turn up the lights a bit, seems to be really dark at times.   Must and staff and Glenn on the door still fantastic as ever."}
{"text":"Over the weekend I learned for the first time that the Brant House was no more and about four months ago it re-branded, renovated and reopened as The Citizen. A more casual cocktail restaurant and lounge with a menu focusing more on tapas sized sharing portions.  Our party of 8 had reservations for Friday evening to celebrate a friends birthday, an evening meant to be relaxing and enjoyable but ended up being riddled with bumps and band-aids.  To begin, upon arrival, I have to give them credit, they had definitely changed this place around. The decor, vibe and staff were far more casual and friendly than the Brant house once was. The stuffy patrons, the snooty staff, the food... all different! I thought \"Self, this is the kinda place you'd like to come to... plus, hey look a that craft cocktails!\"  We were seated around 8:30 and service was to say the least, very slow. With significant gaps between drink orders, drink deliveries, food orders and food service, it was after 10 pm by the time the first trickle of food began to roll out. I say trickle out because the kitchen, while potentially busy, struggled with timing on orders. A chorizo sausage appetizer shared by 3 of us, arrived about 10 minutes before the lobster roll appetizers ordered by the same 3 people - the other 5 guests received nothing for at least another 10 minutes. After which point we asked to speak to the manager twice, and then *poof* food began to roll out. I was surprised the first items to come out then were the cucumber and watermelon salads - something that could have easily come out far earlier. All food with the exception of one guests dinner kale salad arrived, said salad didn't arrive until most of us had nearly completed out mains meaning one guest had gone nearly 2.5 hours without food. Not good.  In terms of our server, I would have to rate her 2 stars or lower. I cannot speak to what other guests at our table experienced but I found our server to be unprepared and not very helpful. When I asked what kind of steak was used in the steak frites, she \"didn't know\" and didn't offer to find out. When I asked how the lamb was cooked? She responded \"I'm not sure\" so I asked her to look into that for me when she didn't offer. I also noticed a consistent trend amongst our guests orders, whenever a guest would ask how an item was, her response was \"it's good.\" That's it, I asked for more details to which there was none. I can appreciate that someone might be new or unfamiliar with the menu fully, but to not know basics about their few main course options was not good. In addition, we went our entire meal without water being offered. It wasn't until the manager came over to speak with us that water top ups were provided - once we asked... again.  What I will say, to their credit, is that 90% of the food items (save for the lobster rolls) were fantastic. Perfectly cooked, expertly prepared, presented and a joy to eat. Now I can't say if the fact that we were starving played a factor in our relief/enjoyment of our meals... but as I said, I'll give them their due, the food was good. What was wrong with the lobster roll? Less than a table spoon of lobster could be found on an oversized brioche bun, a nice attempt/taste but  poor execution overall.   My steak frites were amazing, slathered in bourbon butter and pre-sliced into easy to eat pieces - top 5 steaks I've had no questions asked.  So, what did management do once they came over to speak to us? They totally owned up. I have to admit, their management of our situation and the perfection of their food are the main reasons this review is a 3 star and not the 1 star it could have been. The manager apologized profusely citing the busy nature of the restaurant as the root cause of our experience (save for our less than helpful server). He knocked the three steak frites dinners off of our bill (approx. $90 in value) and 2 rounds of shots for the table. A kind and generous gesture which seemed to appease the group.  Other notes, cocktails are fair, not great. The negroni was very well done while the Old Fashioned was watered down and not well done compared to other spots in the area.   I hope that the majority of the issues we came up against are merely growing pains, their food is incredible and deserves to be sampled.  Eatcrest Out."}
{"text":"The Good: Food for everyone || The Bad (and I mean BAD): The  entry system during club portion of the night (especially if you're racialized, male, and not up to the pre-determined \"look\" they want in their venue). I hate to bring race into this, but evidently when you're inside, you can clearly see the homogenous groups of people that are let into the venue and clearly isn't representative of the people trying to get in or partying in the city.   Went here for a big group birthday celebration on Saturday night. No real complaints about the dinner service which was prix fixe and portions were plentiful and good tasting. Everyone had a superb time for dinner. However, the evening portion was a bit frustrating as we had friends joining us post-dinner / during the club hours.  When they begin to transition into the club night portion of the evening they remove many of the dining tables off the floor. Apparently, if \"you're not on the guest list or have bottle service, you're not getting in\". Even though they claim to let people in by guest list, this guest list is almost impossible to find. Our 4 friends (three males and one female) were told the above at 10:45pm.   I've worked in the industry for almost 9 years and have never seen or heard of such douchey, race-based, and preferential treatment of guests in my life. The managers of the venue can be seen at the rear bar drinking with other industry people and having fun, while bouncers at the door are the biggest problem (who obviously uphold what the managers tell them).   Anyways, our friends waited two hours in line from 10:45pm. TWO HOURS for a place that wasn't even full until past midnight. I ran into two friends that happened to be female, and they mentioned that they got into the club in a few minutes and got free drinks because they knew the manager. So to Pedro the Manager, who responds to most reviews on Yelp and Facebook, you're clearly lying and deceiving ANYONE who reads these reviews by saying that the venue doesn't play favouritism and is \"fair\". It's a lie, and you and the other managers need to really think about the poor image your venue gets when people are refused at the door and blatantly lied to.  In summary, and I think I'm being fair here: go here for the food and dinner. You get awesome food and don't have to pay any cover or coat-check if you stay for the party portion. Keep in mind the slightly pricey menu, but not bad.   If you're coloured, male, or don't have enough females in your group, didn't purchase $350 min. bottle service or on their \"guest list\", then avoid at ALL costs to avoid the disappointment. Seriously. The bouncers and management basically hope that those criteria flush out anyone that isn't fitting the look they want in their club.  I'll be sure to contact the Better Business Bureau and Toronto's Municipal Licensing & Standards offices regarding The Citizen. Venues like these put a bad taste to Toronto's entertainment scene and it's a perfect example of how exclusionary clubs and venues can be."}
{"text":"Oh, the rules. The rules, rules rules rules. First, I will say, the food was very good.  And our waitress was very sweet and attentive. That said, the two waitresses that looked after us Did forget to place the order for a Caesar salad. Kind of inexplicable, considering there were 3 tables on the go at the time, and tons of staff.   So on to the rules. We arrived at 5:00, asked for a table for 6 outside in the then EMPTY patio. We were told, since there were only 4 of us there, we could only sit at a sun-filled (yes, it was a hot day) table for 4 until the others arrived. To be clear, there was no one, no one else on the patio. Just us. The waitress politely said it was the rule, and called the manager. Well, unbelievable as it sounds, in a \"world class\" city such as Toronto, she stood by the rules. No, we couldn't sit in the shady seats, unless the others from our group arrived. I get it, if there was a line up, or the place was full, totally understand. But it was completely Empty. Just us, asking for a table, in an empty restaurant.   It must be nice to have so much $, you can enforce idiotic rules such as these. We finally got the table we asked for, when we suggested we'd all sit at separate tables. She FINALLY got the point, sort of, after an eye roll you could see from a mile away. Our friends arrived 5 minutes later.   Over the next 1.5 hours we enjoyed our food, and relatively good service. Then we left because they have another rule, only allowed to be there for 2 hours. Wow.  Yikes, it's an empty restaurant, the Jays game just let out, the theatre matinees are letting out, and PanAm is in town. And it's empty. Give your head a shake, and use your head. Unforgivable, and WILL NEVER RETURN.  We're locals and you treated us like this. The world is watching, visiting.   Shame on you."}
{"text":"The Citizen is A-OK. We had dinner reservations here on a Friday evening just after the end of their happy hour at 7PM. The place had a surprisingly sparse smattering of people there at that hour. A mix of mostly groups of people there for happy hour, and a couple of tables like us who came for dinner. The space is large, and there was plenty of empty seats. Despite this, we were pointed to one of the more not ideal tables located on what I presume is the edge of the dance floor. The table was wobbly, the seats were bar stool height and uncomfortable. All the more quickly to get diners outta there before dancing starts later in the evening. I have to say this again - there were SO MANY empty booths and seats that we could have been given, that were STILL empty by the time we finished dinner. If they were reserved, it wouldn't have mattered because we would have been gone by the time more people supposedly would have came in for late night drinks. Anyway, it went a long way to giving a sense that we're second-class Citizens.   I had the maple mustard wings which were pretty good. My friend had the southern bbq wings, which unfortunately tasted more like curry. ??? Others had steak and fries, which were OK. Check-in and redeem the yelp free drink. That was at least nice and a redeeming feature."}
{"text":"Good bar/lounge/club. Came here on a Friday after a year or two long break of no 'clubbing.' The entrance is pretty confusing for many - Many people, like myself, end up going to Cibo Wine Bar instead and having to be directed to the right place. It's tucked into the street itself, rather than being smack on the corner of King and Brant.   The line-up moved quickly. There was a $10 cover which is fine. The set up is actually pretty nice. The drinks were fairly priced. Bartenders weren't pretentious. All in all, this is a good place to hang out with some friends while pounding back some drinks and dancing."}
{"text":"I never went before they renovated which most of the pics show the old style. But I went last week because some friends suggested it and it was fun. Theres a good sized dance floor and the space is decent. Music was good hip hop top 40 and rnb, crowd was good as well, i'd go back now that I know about it"}
{"text":"Packed, loud, lots of 20s and 30s dressed up if you're into that kind of thing. My conversations consisted of nodding and smiling pretending I could hear what people were saying because its that loud. Wont be back."}
{"text":"$4 Heinikin on King Street- Nothing else to say. Cheers"}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5 stars.   I came here with my bunch of my girlfriends and when we got there there were 2 lines formed (not too sure why).  So logically, we stood at the shorter line. The bouncer let the girls in front of us go in and when it came to my friends and I, he said we were in the wrong line up and need to join the longer one! We had to go alllllllllllll the way in the back. It was about a 20-30 minute wait not to mention we were in dresses and heels and it was freezing out. We noticed the bouncer would let random girls and they weren't even in line. W T F!  When we finally got in there was a $10 cover. The place was also super crowded. The ONLY good thing about this place is that the music was really good - hip hop, r&b, top 40 etc.  I would definitely go again but CITIZEN you need to improve on the entry system. That shit ain't right."}
{"text":"Another reviewer on here called this place \"douchebaggery at its finest\". But I think they are being a little harsh. I mean this is a pretty cool space to get ratchet at. They have a heated outside patio, a cool industrially rustic alleyway where you can chief cigs that you don't buy yourself but Stef is just a nice guy and is willing to share. I mean there are douchebags everywhere. That's never going to change. Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world, the disarray. I choose to see the beauty.I also chose to wear my jacket because the coat check was full so I was sweating like a mule. Don't make the same mistake friends. Also, show up absolutely trashed."}
{"text":"You could be dying of a heart attack and nobody who works here would notice. This is a perfect example of a bunch of investors with clashing ideologies making a mess of a space that should really be converted into a GoodLife. What is this place supposed to be? Bartenders seemed like they were from The Brunswick house and did a one week crash course on how to serve food. Had a bad oyster out of a dozen we ordered, the bartender looked at my regurgitated food and asked me if i wanted to finish it.  Everything else was one shed less than mediocre and not memorable. (Chicken wings, Truffle poutine are the only other things i can even recall ingesting)"}
{"text":"Went here last Thursday after hearing so much about it from friends and coworkers and was not disappointed. Thursday just happened to be steak night, my fav! The Thursday special consists of steak frites with a pint of draft beer for $25. I'm not that huge on beer so I asked the waiter if he would be able to substitute it with cider. He said that he definitely could as they have that on tap! So that's definitely something to consider if the idea of your meal coming with beer is turning you off! As for the appetizers, my friends and I shared the fried cauliflower and fries, both which were equally as tasty. However, be forewarned that if you're not the biggest fan of spicy food then the cauliflower appetizer might not be for you. As previously mentioned for my main I ordered the Thursday special and my steak was beautifully medium rare, soft, tender and juicy!!!! It's hard to nail steak like this, especially at a place that isn't necessarily a steakhouse. It came cut into strips on a bed of fries. The fries were perfect as well, with a hint of seasoning. I would definitely come here again and maybe stay a little later and see how the place turns once \"clubbing\" hours start! The decor was amazing and I loved the cognac leather couches! Definitely come here if you're looking for a nice sit down restaurant where you can hang with some friends and the vibe is right."}
{"text":"It's a great bar with a nice open space for events, and large crowds. Right in smack dab on Brant St, it's not pretentious at all, and a nice place to casually hang out.   Get there between 5-7 and take advantage of their happy hour and half price snacks, otherwise - like the rest of the menu it's really pricey.   *CHECK IN ON YELP TO GET A FREE DRINK WITH MAIN PURCHASE*  Save yourself a good $9 on wine, potentially.   We came here for drinks with a large crowd. The servers were really good at keeping everyone tabs separate even though we were one big group on the couches. Not particularly a fan of couches, keeps the group low to the ground, with limited seating - while others mingling are standing up an awkwardly talking to you.   For food, I got the fried chicken. One chicken liver, one big piece of crispy chicken skin, and two dark meat thighs. Really tasty, all on top of mustard greens and a side of watermelon. But was it worth $23?   Most things on the menu looked really good, but at the hefty price for basically glorified bar food, is a little much.   The service was excellent. In addition to keeping everyones separate tabs in line, she also took off the more expensive free drink (wine) which I appreciated."}
{"text":"Food - 6/10  Service 7/10  Atmosphere 9/10   We came here on a Saturday night at around 9pm and when we asked the hostess for a table, we were told that the eating portion of the night was over and that only bar seats were available. This was fine as we came primarily for drinks, however when we spoke with the bartender, he told us that this was false and handed us menus to order food. The bartenders were very attentive and made sure we got everything we needed, checking in periodically to make sure we were okay. This made up for the cold reception we received from the hostesses.   The food selection was unimpressive and the food itself was mediocre. I had the stuffed chicken wings and the beet risotto which sounded great in concept, but somewhere along the line something went wrong and the product in front of me was barely enjoyable and left me with a feeling of regret. The chicken wings were good, but the risotto on the other hand,  tasted like it was made from cheap quality ingredients. I felt like there was an element missing from the dish.   The drinks, however were made very well and were priced even better. It only cost $6 for a vodka cranberry with premium vodka (grey goose), which is practically unheard of on King west. I really enjoyed the club portion of the night, the atmosphere was lively and the DJ played great music. Although, at one point the music was a little geriatric, but that's expected considering the crowd."}
{"text":"I come here frequently enough, especially when it was the brant house.  it still has a similar vibe for the lounge/night club portion and to be honest its a pretty decent night out.  with that said in terms of the night life portion, I give it 4 stars. However I was extremely disappointed in terms of the stipulations and rules in order to throw a big dinner party.  I.e.; lack of split bill option for guests (really? bill can only be split 6 ways? thats so inconvenient for bigger parties to figure out money issues when its cheque-time), not allowed to bring cake and only able to purchase one from them for $50+, set menu that wasn't all that appealing and lacked selection for the price plus a additional gratuity fee of 18%.  Not to mention a late policy and paying for meals for guests that are no shows... I personally understand the paying for meals for no shows especially when you state a certain number of guests and the food is made ahead of time and I also understand having some sort of late policy.  I also understand that this works for corporate parties, where the company picks up the cheque. However, I will say that many parties are thrown that are not corporate, and guests pay for their own bill, and its still revenue.  These stipulations combined are enough for me to take my business elsewhere because it makes everything difficult when people just want to focus on their potential celebration.  A party event should be easy and one should not have to worry about gathering guests together and then having to worry about how to pay for the bill on one card or a few cards.  This shows me that they need more understanding about customer base and service but I will say, at least everything is laid out in front of you, and actually it makes the decision either you're in or you're out."}
{"text":"My review is based on the food and our own experience.  For dinner we had the truffle putine and the caprese salad. Both were really delicious but also pricey for the portion we were given. The food and beer menu is also limited.  We attend 'The Citizen' for a birthday which turned into a nightmare. One of our companions has a food allergy and asked not to have a specific garnish added to their meal. After a few bites, our companion realized the dish had been garnished and had to be escorted to the hospital. Once our companion and their family left, the restaurant presented us with the bill for our companion, their spouse and their other six family members.  We were fortunate that we could work out an arrangement and we appreciate the helpfulness of the manager that evening."}
{"text":"Pretentious and refuses to sit a $300 guaranteed tab at the table at 9:30pm....holding out for a min $750 bottle service. This is exactly what's wrong with King West...Do yourself a favour and go somewhere that treats customers properly.  Thank you for the great service whomever the manager is the night of March 19."}
{"text":"Free WiFi. Plus. If you want to be left alone by the wait staff, this is your place. It became a game to see if we could stare at someone to get their attention. Near impossible. Appears a highly engaged team, as they spend a lot of time chatting. Or drinking a shot as they just now finished. Interesting.  If only our service came so quickly. It wasn't crowded, I'm not surprised. One of the worst bar experiences I've had."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were there for dinner on a Friday evening. Service was slow as our waiter was also serving a large party. Food arrived quickly: I had the Asian kale, was not very impressed. We also had the duck Flatbread which was delicious and the fries. Overall, would recommend for a date night."}
{"text":"I think The Citizen is a great place and is one of the busiest venues in Toronto right now.   As to Sara's comment below, I fail to see truth on what you are expressing. I book ahead of time always with the very well known perfectly groomed stylish hair bouncer. Him and the staff have always made sure my entry was flawless and you are right, they do make me feel special. By the way, I am not blond and I am not white. I think you should try arriving at the busiest spot in the city around 10pm to ensure your entry.  I have always enjoyed The Citizen ever since they have opened.  Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Great place to go on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night!  The guys at the front are always wonderful and they make sure that we aren't standing in line too long especially when we don't bring jackets  I am here every Friday because I have never had a bad experience unlike at some other clubs. Also great scene and music. Don't get fooled by the \"lounge\" aspect, it is a perfect mix of bar and club"}
{"text":"I laff this place. Been coming here on a pretty regular basis for the past 2-3 months I would say. It's a fun crowd, music is good.   It's really hard to make your way to the bar or anywhere really if it's a busy night so...do like me and buy 4 beers at a time if you can get a bar tender's attention. I've had fun times here - recommended!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty awesome bartender last night at the Young Film Makers Party who was lovely and attentive and was charging me $8 a drink (the proper price). I had a second bartender who was also seemingly lovely and attentive who was charging me $9 a drink for the same drink. I guess what I'm getting at is that I didn't appreciate the fact that the 2nd bartender was tacking on his own tip hoping to be double tipped. I can only assume he had been encountering quite a few non-tippers and decided to take matters into his own hands. I guess in the future I'll ask for my bill. It's a shame it happened."}
{"text":"We loved the ambiance of the outside patio and our fantastic server. She was truly wonderful and very helpful. The nachos were HUGE - definitely enough for two to share. Could have used more toppings though. Brussel sprouts were phenom and I usually don't like them. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This establishment was recommended to me by the concierge at Trump Tower Toronto (see review). I was slightly disappointed as I expected more of a lounge atmosphere. The loud music, cover charge and difficulty ordering a drink from the bar took away from what was possibly meant to be a rustic lounge. There is not seating or cocktail tables for those who have not reserved tables for bottle service. This makes the open area surrounding the bar uncomfortable, crowded, and inefficient for those who would like to order a cocktail. I would not recommend this bar to friends or family traveling to Toronto, unless they are in a large group and intend to reserve a table for the bottle service."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. Great place to grab a drinks with friends, or a date.  Easy to nibble, shareable food. I wouldn't come here for a sit-down dinner experience."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. I had issues getting to the ATM even when offering to leave my driver's license. This place will last because there's always a crowd wanting such a joint. But there is definitely better value along King and other parts of the city (Ossington, even Yorkville - different scenes, but still a good time). Friday night DJ was good though; solid mix of old school and recent - hip hop to dancehall to house."}
{"text":"The ambience is beautiful but the food doesn't compare- it's very greasy and salty. I had the fried chicken. It had the bone and fat still attached to it and it was greasier than KFC. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Come here if you: -Want cheap drinks after work ($4 drink happy hour) -Want to sit outside on a patio -Want to get drinks with friends/colleagues in a relaxed/lounge environment (inside has cool leather couches)  This is our go-to spot for after work drinks, we are here all the time"}
{"text":"Came for a birthday dinner, we had reservations for a large group and when we arrived a petite blonde hostess lied and said we called in and canceled the reservation which was untrue, seeing as no one in our party called and canceled. She was extremely dry & rude, did not want to seat us, and kept insisting we canceled, when in fact we didn't. The entire party was there standing in front of her, waiting to be seated while the whole restaurant was empty. Finally she reluctantly grabbed the menus and took us to our table. Being Vegan there weren't many options, but luckily someone in the party knew the manager who was kind enough to accommodate us with vegan versions of the brussel sprouts, cauliflower and a coconut cheese risotto. The appetizers/small plates were fantastic, but sadly the risotto had a very sour after taste. Still, our service was great, the server was a complete doll & made up for the unpleasant seating hostess. Dinner was good overall, aside from the small hiccup when we arrived, the food was quality, and the decor/ambiance is nice. I hope to come back for a night of drinks and great music."}
{"text":"The Citizen. New restau-lounge that's opened up in the previous place of Brant House. (I'd never been to Brant House, so I won't have any comment on how the new place compares to the old.)  I came here with some friends on the 29th of March (BlogTO says the place opened on March 20th). I hadn't heard anything about it previously, other than the fact that it was where Brant House in fact was.   Reaction: Before entering, I was expecting this place to be a pretty upscale place. But, pretty much as soon as I walked through the door, that expectation disappeared and the place gave me an instant vibe of dressy casual, social, unpretentious, chill vibe.   It could probably be because of the mixed-use space that included standing room, bar seating, dinner tables; it could also probably be all of the huge tv's around the place showing NHL and NBA games. It might also be the decor, the music, the diverse crowd.  Nevertheless, I was a fan.  Coat check was complementary, which was a surprise. In hindsight, it makes sense if many of your patrons are there for dinner too.   I went for some standard bar-rail drinks - but did see that they had a good selection of higher end top-shelf whiskies, scotches, vodkas, etc. They also had a couple of bar areas in different parts of the room.  I didn't have a chance to sample the food, but look forward to coming back here and giving it a shot.  Welcome, The Citizen."}
{"text":"To start with the good: they have a good happy hour - drinks are $4.  To cover why I am giving two stars, here I start: 1. They have average or below average food that is overpriced. We order their kickoff kale and trout which had a few pieces of thinly sliced cured trout (probably less then 1oz) and kind of old kale. It was not dress at all. That was $15 2. The customer service: the girl was friendly but did not do the extra step to let us know that the happy hour is over and continued charging us full price for everything we ordered.  The space was kind of empty while all other restaurants on King are usually full. If they step up their game with the food and improve their customer service it may be a good place to visit otherwise but for now I may be coming back just for drinks."}
{"text":"Love this spot. It has changed hands a lot but I think this iteration is by far the best. I used to only come during the weekend for the club but I've been frequenting more often with work colleagues and there are so many options for seating. You can be intimate with the couches, professional with the tables, casual with the high-tops or large group-networking w the back area. And the food has gotten worlds better!!!  Kudos to the management staff!"}
{"text":"Meh, nice looking place.  The food was very plain, they didn't cook the burger very well.  I felt the service was unimpressive.  I would not go here again.  Even the drinks were not that great.  Everything was pretty average.  A place in such a location as this one, needs to put more effort in. The staff almost seemed upset we were there.  Additionally when we came in they told us they were not sure they had room for us, the place was literally EMPTY.  We were the only people there."}
{"text":"The bar space and music itself is fine. It's decorated in a nice way. I would like to mention however that the bouncers are ridiculously rude. I have not been to a crowded bar like this since my university days, and as a young professional I was shocked to have grown bouncers in suits yelling at me to move out of they way... Like it's just odd, I haven't been treated like that since I was a student and I was in genuine shock. Just had to comment on that. Also nothing was on tap on the night I was there, except $8 bottles of Blue, which is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Better than Brant House.   Citizen has some pretty amazing dishes. I love: 1. Truffle Poutine 2. BBQ Chicken Lettuce Wraps 3. Southern Fried Chicken"}
{"text":"Super excited that this place had a check in offer for a free beer or wine! Free wine please!!  This used to be the Brant House, but having only been there once several years ago, I can't attest to any similarities or differences. Drinks are expensive!! Cocktails are about $12-$14 each, so prepare to shell out your cash for drinks!  The food was good - poutine was made with goat cheese, gravy and mushrooms. An odd combo but still very tasty (and gluten free!) had the BBQ chicken wraps as well (gfree - wrapped in lettuce). Also very good - the flavors were all on point.  Portion sizes were small. With the poutine and the wraps I was still hungry. Considering the prices, I expected to at least feel somewhat full.  As it was a Friday, the place turned into a club-ish scene after about 10. The music was pretty terrible (the DJ was awful!!) and there wasn't much dancing so much as people standing and talking.  So final evaluation? GOOD food, okay prices, bad club scene. I'd return for the food, despite the cost."}
{"text":"Preface: This review is for A LARGE GROUP experience... I do believe that smaller groups might have a shot of having a better experience.   We went here this past Saturday for my cousin's 30th Birthday. There were 25 people to be served, and the menu was pre-set, family style.   Everyone was seated with adequate space. There were two servers taking care of us. Both were friendly, from what I saw of them. They came around to half of the table, and didn't ask for drink orders. I ended up going to the bar to get a drink.   The salad was served, which was lovely. Not 5 minutes afterwards the entire meal was on the table... Pasta, steak, chicken breast, roasted potato medley, and French fries. The food wasn't delivered at appropriate times... We didn't have enough time to finish our salad because of fear that all of the other food would get cold.   The steak was cooked well, but cold by because of the serving time. The chicken breast was moist, but tasted synthetic. The pasta sauce tasted like it came out of a jar, and the noodles were over cooked. The best parts of the meal were the fries and the salad... And as Homer Simpson's so smartly put in the past, you don't win friends with salad. The dessert was equally terrible, a chocolate brownie that was dry and an apple crumble that was raw and doughy. They really should have served some ice cream with that dessert... It would have masked some of the problems with the dish.   We stayed after for when it turned into a club, and ordered bottle service. The VIP area is crowded, the servers were scant and rude. The DJ sucked.  Needless to say that I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday and had the pre-set family style menu. Which means all the food came in huge portions and were to share. I didn't have much expectations coming in but surprisingly the food was pretty good. The portions were huge, my party with mostly guys couldn't even finish it. The chicken and steak were both good, very juicy. Bibimbap wasn't authentic, it was more like a fried rice. The cauliflowers were definitely my favourite! Deep fried tequila shot almost never came. We had to ask the server several times about it. But wouldn't bother next time cuz it was gross. Thank god we brought cupcakes in for the birthday party.  And obviously got too drunk to remember to let my camera eat first after the dip until the cupcake came out lol we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to have drinks and dance. Went for dinner on a Friday; food was unremarkable.  Music was great (mostly throwback r&b...but good stuff...and I usually don't gravitate towards r&b) Decent crowd. I'd go back  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I came to the Citizen on a Saturday night with a group of 8. We shared some snacks which were fantastic! Great menu choices, and executed well. The cocktails were tasty and exactly what I was looking for but the price point is outrageous.   At a certain point they told us we couldn't sit there anymore because they were moving tables to turn this restaurant into more of a bar/lounge. I was a little disappointed because no one told me this over the phone, or made me aware that we could only be sitting for a short period of time when I made the reservation.   Regardless, the DJ was playing amazing music and I was with friends so I was happy.   Overall, it's a typical King West vibe - but way overpriced!  $15 for 4 small meatballs!? C'mon"}
{"text":"The entry/door staff are essentially running their own racketeering organization by aggressively soliciting bribes to skip a line that I believe they keep long to \"make it worth it to pay to skip it\" ... I was greeted with \"ID please, it's going to be a while in this line, or if you pay us, we can let you skip it\" ... I offered 25 CAD for 2 well dressed and socially normal males and was told that wasn't enough.  No problem, so we waited in line.  I heard him continue to ask everyone for a bribe saying things like \"this is just how it works\" to other potential patrons.  Then, the line barely moved (this is around 11pm).  The line really only moved when people waiting in line verbally indicated that they were too fed up and left, or were too fed up with the line and gathered enough money for an acceptable bribe.  There are very attractive both females and males in the line, this is not for un-cool people, it's strictly about the money that likely doesn't even go to the venue.  I overheard a female indicate that the line is \"a show in order to make people want to bribe more\" ... obviously if the line is moving quickly, the market for bribes goes down.  I come from a culture where it's normal to bribe, but not normal to solicit and ask ... I really feel like the door staff has taken the bribe thing too far at this venue and are basically running a business within a business.  Once inside, it's not a bad place, but I would generally avoid as there are a lot of other bars nearby that you won't have to deal with this frustration and enter in a reasonable amount of time without being hassled or paying an exorbitant bribe."}
{"text":"Great large club with beautiful people all ages.   Good music.   Had a good time thanks! We will rerurn.  -* bars have different booze pricing.   While main floor bar has one price.  The bar in the back charges$2 more for exact same drinks.   Not a biggie.  Just strange."}
{"text":"Citizen has many faces. You can go for food, for happy hour, or for the bar/club at night. Overall I would give 3/5, definitely go for happy hour but skip here for dinner.   FOOD/COCKTAILS: as a restaurant, I would give this place 2/5. I tried their watermelon mojito, which was tasty but didn't have much alcohol to it. I ordered a detox salad, described as seasonal vegetables with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The salad was actually an arugula/lettuce salad mix with PICKLED strawberries, radishes, and onions? How are any of these seasonal, especially in March?  HAPPY HOUR: as a place to hang out after work, Citizen is 5/5. They have $5 apps and wine, beer, rail etc Tues-Fri from 5-7pm! Apps menu includes classic fries, chips and guacamole, popcorn chicken, etc.   CLUB: 3/5 - they play throwback and top 40, which is always fun! My experience on Thursdays have been good, but the lines on the weekend are 30-60 min after 10:45PM, even if the place is actually empty inside."}
{"text":"Came from out of town, extremely crowded but everybody was extremely friendly. It's like a dancing bar-no techno."}
{"text":"Fun times on Friday nights - slightly older crowd and the music is reasonable. Generally a much more relaxed crowd then the younger crew on Saturday nights. Definitely going again on a Friday. The drinks are 'happy hour' priced during the week.  Unfortunately they charged $10 cover at 10pm on Friday...why? Not too sure as the bar was still empty. Maybe around midnight it would make sense to do that, but beforehand it was annoying."}
