{"text":"Only good thing about this place is that they sell beer.  Otherwise the service was poor, food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great and the food is mediocre at best. The beer selection isn't great. The glasses our beer was served in was dirty and we had to ask for a new glass. When she brought back a new glass it was still dirty (had crusted food on the rim of the glass). Prices were decent. I wouldn't recommend it as there are many other places to better spend your money better."}
{"text":"Prime Rib special on Friday nite is outstanding, best kept secret in Oakville, very reasonable food prices, some great bar staff, excellent chef And great live music Sundays 330 -7pm."}
{"text":"Great pub atmosphere and location however that is kind of where it ends. Draft selection is typical of any other pub with no local or even semi local micro brews (seems to by the case in Oakville). This fact could be overlooked if the food made it worthwhile. Sadly, after three attempts we hung our heads in defeat. Sub par food coming out of the kitchen that included rotten veggies in the veggie plate. I think there are better places to spend my $$ unfortunately."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way from Niagara to Toronto for some corned beef. All they had were cb in a Reuben.  It was perfect. Wait staff friendly. Learned not to call waitress \"mam\" and was jokingly corrected to call her \"miss\". I would return if I lived here."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings in Oakville, Ontario.  They are not breaded, just deep-fried goodness.  They have Guinness, Kilkenny, and assorted Alexander Keiths on tap...plus a few others.  My wife and I have had several items off the menu.   All were good.  Service was good.  It is a bit hard to find, so use mapquest."}
{"text":"A busy place on a Wed night wth several tables marked as reserved.  Server managed to find us a table.  Lots of large groups dine here it seems and it was trivia night too.

We ordered the veggie curry and the fish and chips.  The food was good and the service was friendly and attentive.

Worth a repeat trip!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Go somewhere else. I ordered the ultimate abbey burger. It looked like somebody sat on it. The meat was burnt and so salty I was only able to take one bite out of it. I tried to eat the fries but I am sure they had been fried more than once so it was a waste of $14.99 dollars plus tax and tip."}
