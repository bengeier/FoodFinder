{"text":"Really authentic food! WE enjoy their haleem and pakistani style burgers a lot. The haleem is seriously one of the best I've ever had outside pakistan.   It would be great if they could clean up the place a bit and make it more suitable for sitting instead of doing takeaway all the time. Great halal option in Calgary!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star is because of its gol gappay, but other than that the other food was horrible!!!! The burger was falling apart and filled with nothing but mayonnaise. Furthermore, the buns were old and Moldy! I DO NOT recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. This is my 'adda' for nehari. Best nehari closest to what you find in Karachi. I have been there so many times that the moment we walk in they start preparing our order:) me and my wife both love it. Nehari is not the only item that is good, I tried biryani, Haleem, and Karachi style burger all was delicious. Fried chicken is not that great comparing quality of other items on menu."}
{"text":"Home of the famous Karachi bun kebab!  Papri chaat, bun kebab, Haleem are the main orders for us along with falooda for dessert!  All are a great bang for the buck but service is totally lacking...I know you don't go to a desi restaurant for service but here you have to overly be on top of the person you ordered with to ensure they don't forget about you."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place does not have a lot of reviews as it deserves a lot of good reviews and ratings. I'd give 5/5 and wish could give more...why? Cause..  1) Food is cheaper comparatively to downtown restaurant  2) Does not taste like Canadian desi food, it tastes like pure Karachi food  3) Friendly staff and and great ambiance  I'd say the best haleem, nihari and briyani you can find in Calgary. Recently, I tried their beef burger loaded and I'd say after 3 years my craving for real Karachi beef burger was satisfied. Lasagna was also good with lots of chicken in it. The only thing I do not like is they do not offer delivery in my area and I have to drive all the way there but honestly, it is totally worth it. :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars... so many issues at this restaurant where do I start, even if no one is this takes for ever for food to come out, then there was a hair in my burger they didn't do anything about it never going back again...don't waste your time here...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.... Chat papri, biryani, fried chicken, beef burgers and faloda are all amazing here.... It's a must try place really loved it..."}
{"text":"Wow its always nice to find a halal fast food style restaurant! The zinger and lollipop chicken was excellent. The chicken wrap and strips were pretty good. The haleem, papri chaat, gol gappas and biryani were mediocre. Their strength lies in Western food, you can get much better desi food elsewhere.  You MUST try the kulfi platter. OH MY GOD. It include khoya, mango, pistachio & vanilla. Best part is its homemade!"}
{"text":"Their Haleem is the best-est....... big portion size enough for 2 ppl easily!!!owner is very friendly and great service!"}
