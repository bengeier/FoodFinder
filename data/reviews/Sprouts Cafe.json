{"text":"Located in the basement of Organic Marketplace on New Hope Road, the staff makes fresh soups and hummus daily. Also homemade salad dressings on thier raw food and salad bar. They make healthy wraps and pizzas and have a great selection of smoothies."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was egregious. A cashier responded angrily towards me, when I politely asked her about specific ingredients on the menu; after speaking with a manager concerning the aforementioned, she defended the employee and explicated that she probably acted like that because a kitchen employee quit, which gave them an overwhelming amount of additional work: thus, justification to act unprofessionally to a regular customer, who spent thousands there. My family and I used to spend hundreds of dollars a month there but since have spent thousands at Whole Foods Market and decided to never shop there again."}
{"text":"Cool little organic cafe with an organic market upstairs. The food was fresh and tasty at lunch; salad bar was lame, but it's probably seasonal."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!!!! ALERT ALERT!!!  New owners!!!!!  This place has completely fallen off and is nothing like it was before. They should not even be allowed to use the name. No house made anything except soup. Everything is prepackaged reheated nonsense with ONLY one vegan option outside of a salad. Go elsewhere if you want quality food.  Also if the new owner is at all interested it salvaging this business they should revert back ASAP. Otherwise you lost a decent size group of your loyal customers if not now soon!"}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise. Delicious homemade pimento cheese, lots of veggies, yummy muffins and craft beer. Really, everything you need for a perfect lunch."}
{"text":"The good: I had the quinoa veggie burger (minus cheese to veganize) and farro salad. The food was great, but too expensive for what's on the plate.   The bad: The customer service was terrible. It was our first (and only) time here, so we weren't quite sure if we should seat ourselves. When we asked we were abruptly told to \"just wait at the counter\".  We were also treated like idiots for asking questions about the menu. We ate on the patio since it was a beautiful day. When our food was brought to us outside, we were told that we had to get up and go inside to get our own silverware. No one ever checked to see if we needed anything or were satisfied with the food....not even a \"have a nice day\" as we were leaving."}
{"text":"If you want a healthy place to eat in Gastonia then I recommend Sprouts.  I eat here on average 2 to 3 times a week.  I have never had anything bad and everything is fresh and organic.  You know it is fresh when the garden is right outside the door.  Lunch will cost you from $7 to $10."}
{"text":"Excellent recipes & fresh ideas for completely organic, non-GMO, & vegetarian dishes. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem with fabulous food. I always stop here when traveling I-85 to SC. Sprouts has an impressive menu that accommodates both vegans and omnivores. The owner is exceptionally kind and very happy to accommodate any requests. I've only eaten lunch here (due to my travel time), but wouldn't hesitate to try it for dinner. So far, I haven't been disappointed with anything I have had. *not pictured: a gf/df peanut butter chocolate bar that was scrumptious. I bought 2!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Love their veggie burger on gluten free toasted bread.  Wish they were open later for dinner & brunch too.  hard to find \"clean\" eating options in the area."}
{"text":"Good, clean, healthy food. Friendly service and a relaxed atmosphere. Unique experience and worth checking out."}
{"text":"First time stopping in to this cozy cafe! My co-workers and I ordered for take out however it was so cozy we wished we would have ordered in. I had the mushrooms and peppers personal pizza with the kale salad. Yum! One of my co-workers had the goddess green pizza which she said was outstanding! The mushroom Au Jus was to die for according to the other co-worker. Now I'm looking forward to going back just to try the Mushroom Au Jus and perhaps a smoothie as well. I think I'm turning into a health food fanatic! Yesss!"}
{"text":"Natural Food below an Organic/Natural store is a double WIN. The added bonus is the fact that the people are so earthy and friendly from the staff to the patrons of this yummy establishment. There is a garden out front that I believe they grow a lot of the veggies used inside which reminds me a lot of my Fav in Durham, NC (Refectory Cafe). The daily board is always updated with a main dish the chef decided to make in addition to the normal menu for the day. It also list the special sides for the day.  I almost ALWAYS get the chef special just because that's something that you may not see again.  My FAVS include but are not limited to: Turkey BLT Veggie Burger Curry Tuna  Red Eye Juice Fruit Smoothie  Did I mention all the FAB waters, juices, organize snacks and treats that you can think of.   The only two reasons I didn't supply 5stars are: 1) The check-in offer isn't valid 2) After several visits dealing with many of the same people, there is no personable connection with the consumer. I'm very memorable and after several visits you'd think they would have a report with a frequent customer however instead they approach as if it's my first visit each time LoL"}
{"text":"Favorite juice bar and smoothies in Gastonia and so close to Belmont!  Only the freshest and highest quality fresh ingredients are used!  Try the Clean Gut or Funky Monkey- don't forget you can create your own too."}
{"text":"I love Sprouts and visit it for lunch every time I am in the Gastonia area. The fresh juice is amazing and the daily specials are unique and always good!"}
{"text":"I almost feel like I need to do two reviews. One for food and one for timely service. Food was spectacular. However, it took me 45 minutes from walking in the door to walk out with my to go order which was a turkey wrap with a side of raw veggies. Today was my first time at Sprouts and it was entirely too long of a wait--seemed under staffed."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh healthy soups and salads plus great pizzas for the kids.  Not the cheapest lunch around but the quality of the food was worth the price!"}
{"text":"Quality, thoughtful, delicious food consistently. An innovator in a town diseased with franchise restaurants and fast food"}
{"text":"I had the tastiest southwest turk sandwich I've ever had. Theresa's beef and cheddar was straight from heaven. Even the sides amazing. Grilled baked potato and vegan pasta salad.  Keep this place running and eat healthy!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! A little hard to find (tucked behind the organic market) such a hidden gem! Kale salad was super fresh & dressing was light but full of flavor!"}
{"text":"Delicious Fresh Food! Stopped for lunch on trip from Alabama to Raleigh. Great selection. The side with our grass fed burger, veggie wrap and mushroom Au jus sandwich was a heaping bunch of grapes. Yum"}
{"text":"I like Sprouts because it is the only restraunt in Gastonia I could really put in the vegan/ vegetarian category.  I got a veggie burger or some type.  The actual burger was not bad, but there was sooo much spicy mustard!  It was pretty much uneatable.  I also got a side of vegetable soup that was flavorless.  I really expected more from this restraunt based on what other people had told me.  Vegetarian food can taste better than this!    I went to McDonald's afterwards.    However, I really liked the marketplace that is above the restraunt.  You can find healthy foods here that you otherwise would not be able to find in a regular grocery store.  The staff were friendly in both the marketplace and the cafe area.    I would go again, but I will be sure to ask more questions about the menu items before hand!"}
{"text":"The burger was delicious and the atmosphere downstairs was serene. My buddy can't stop talking about the turkey sandwich/melt. If you have a chance order the ranch salad side, it's unique (included broccoli\" and not too ranchy.  I wish they didn't run out of Sriracha."}
{"text":"Classically, French-trained Chef/Owner creates housemade, fresh dishes daily. Chef Carla is accustomed to accommodating those with food allergies, like Celiac. If having the options to eat Gluten-Free, Vegan, Organic, Grass-Fed and Non-GMO are important to you then Sprouts Cafe will become a favorite. Sprouts has a selection of wines and beers, gluten-free and organic, along with a selection of bottled Kombuchas, sparkling waters and Cold Brew coffee.The Shroom Cap sandwich is full of flavor, filling and light at the same time. I add the plant-based Beyond Meat Patty, (which looks like real meat, but is Vegan), and my tastebuds say, \"Shazam!\" It is incredibly delicious. More options include Grass-Fed Beef Burgers like the Black & Blue, Organic Chicken and Sustainably-Fished Salmon to please all tastebuds. There is homemade Curried Tuna, Chicken Salad, Hummus, and the most awesome, homemade, authentic Caesar Dressing...so good I order it in tubs to bring home to toss in my slaw, slather on sandwiches and make salads. \"It's Our Mission\", \"Garden of Eden\" and the \"Caprese\" Flatbread's are perfection and also come with a Gluten-Free Flatbread-Crust option. Baked goodies are equally impressive with a delectable Gluten-Free Hummingbird Cake being my favorite. The pièce de résistance, however, is Carla's \"Shrimp and Grits\"!  After living in the Bayou City for many years, spending time in New Orleans, and eating Shrimp & Grits at every restaurant in Gaston County, I feel confident in backing Carla against any chef in a S&G throwdown, because she prepares the very BEST I've ever eaten!!! The only downside is the Shrimp & Grits are only available after 3:00pm Thursdays on the Sprouts Cafe Tapas Menu, but you can get them on Friday, Saturday and Sunday since she offers a Brunch Menu in addition to the daily menu and specials. Once a month she carefully constructs a Wine Dinner that will knock your socks off! Situated in the basement of Organic Marketplace, and the location of a former Fire Dept, the place is full of life, great tunes, laughter and a vibe that invites you to come in and eat family-style at the table or just sit off to the side to catch up on social media while you eat. The outdoor seating is pleasant with an untouched pasture of trees beyond the parking lot bordered by the Sprouts Cafe garden. Carla uses the fresh, seasonal vegetables and herbs the garden produces to make dishes even better. You can go upstairs to shop for everything from supplements to food to beauty products. At Sprouts Cafe you're always going to be greeted with a smile. These folks know your name, your face and sometimes what you want to order if you are a creature of habit. Look, I practically live here for healthy, flavorful, satisfying dishes that are made fresh. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Tribute to Sprouts Cafe: A haphazardly written poem.  In the search for food Famished, I was Happened across a storefront Hadn't heard much buzz Organic Marketplace on top Sprouts just below I was certain this is where I'd be spending my dough Organic eats Smoothies and sweet treats A veggie burger for me For my sis, turkey pastrami A Reuben, I'm sure -  but I do not recall She ate so quickly I didn't see much of it at all Mine? It was delicious Nutritious too It made me feel good From my frontal lobe to my shoes Fresh veggies and a recycling theme They said 'Make yourself at home' Within this calming color scheme I'd eaten so good, but didn't suffer from the itis This is what happens -  (sorry, couldn't figure out what to put here, but y'all get the point)"}
{"text":"First time here. I was craving a veggie burger. I got a burger and fruit cup. The place is in the basement of a health food store. The flavor is the food is fresh tasting. That's the only good part. I thought the atmosphere was TOO plain and boring looking. The lunch portion sandwich was the size of a kids sandwich no kidding. After eating I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Best food ever ... also try the vegan banana pecan loaf with chocolate ganache ... hands down to Alex... it was yummy"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I have eaten from Sprouts multiple times, but no more. Yesterday my co-worker found 2 hairs in her sandwich. She took it back and yes they gave her a new sandwich but not her side item. No apology nothing. Really. What's happened with customer service? Yes, Sprouts is very popular and maybe they don't care about 1 person's hairy sandwich. They just lost 10 customers from our office."}
{"text":"Had the BLT, potato salad and Apple Carrot juice to go while traveling through. This little gem is right off the Freeway and in the basement of a health food grocery store! Food was amazing and nicely presented even in a to-go box."}
{"text":"We have been eating here about every two weeks for about a year and have brought our vegetarian and meat eating friends and relatives!!! we all love it ...because the food is so fresh (they have a garden in the area by the outdoor seating) and the taste is wonderful. They have specials every day-get there early...they go fast!!!Too bad they are one of the best kept secrets in Gastonia!!! No advertising....they need a sign big enough for the drivers coming around that curve in the road to see it!!!"}
{"text":"Gastonia, sometimes you surprise me. Sometimes I feel like a jerk for making fun of you. This afternoon was one of those times.  Sprouts is downstairs the absolutely adorable organic grocery in a beautiful mid century building. It is in the basement- which is weird to see in this area of NC.  There is a little outdoor area. It is decorated exactly how you want a place like this to be decorated. They have a good thing going  I ordered there hummus wrap. I think they stuffed it with too many sprouts, but I can't really complain because the restaurant is named sprouts.   I definitely want to come back for juice and to try out the menu a little more.  The salad bar did look sad :("}
{"text":"Came here when they were closed ((by mistake) and the nice lady still made us smoothies that were amazing! We ordered 2 funky monkeys one with almond butter and chocolate, one vanilla and nut butter, and one pB&j they were all fantastic! We got a glimpse at the salad bar and will be back to try food!"}
{"text":"Looking for something different while we were in the area and thought this would make for an interesting choice. On that count, we were certainly correct.  Good thing that I had read up on the place beforehand, or I'm not sure that we would have found it - make sure you realize that they are located on the basement/ground floor of the food store, but not just on the ground floor, but around back. I believe you can get there by going through the food store, but it's simpler to drive around back and go in that way. There is also a sign out front, but it's not obvious.  Once inside, the adventure continues. You are (apparently) supposed to order at the register, at which point you will get a number and the food will be ready when it's ready. Unfortunately there is nothing outlining this anywhere. Perhaps it's waiting for when the sign out front is ready. Note that I don't think there is a sign out front on order. I just suspect this whole thing is indicative of why it is the way it is.  The problem actually gets worse, not because that is an issue, but because they are short staffed, and not only is there no sign explaining the process, but because no one mentions a thing, and if you've never been there, and the menus next to the register are not apparent, but you end up standing there like a moron (it is also possible that I do this regularly), expecting something to happen. And then it does not. For several minutes on end.  Eventually an employee may or may not tell you to have a seat where you like (one of those \"have a seat\" signs that can be flipped around to \"please wait to be seated\" would be nice here). Unfortunately they didn't actually provide the menus either, so when she checked back a while later to ask if we were going to order, she seemed shocked that we were just sitting there doing nothing. Now at this point, you would think that they would provide the menus. Nope. Just seemed shocked that we didn't have them yet.  When we went to get them, at that point, she offered to provide them, and then things started moving, albeit a bit slowly.  Once we decided what we wanted, we needed to get up, place the order at the register (this isn't a bad thing, just outlining how it works here), and sat back down. You will notice we did not get a number. I asked if we were supposed to, because I noticed some sitting there, and I thought it was mentioned along the way. I also got up and got it, since I didn't pick it up and it wasn't offered to be brought over.  Some time later - rather longer than you might expect - the food was delivered, and we ate it. Seriously, that's about all there was to the experience. The actual payment was accepted upon ordering, which isn't bad exactly, but it does mean that you'll tip when you order, rather than upon leaving, so you may want to keep that in mind - perhaps don't leave a tip then but leave it on the table. Or just leave something as you pay and don't worry about it. For us, leaving a tip and then getting next to no service the whole way through was a little odd, because you have to wonder why there was a tip, right?  While they could do with something outlining their process for ordering, and at least a bit of service, the food itself was reasonable. There are lots of options along the vegetarian line, but ultimately, I don't know if it's worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Small cafe on ground floor of health food store. Order at counter and food brought by server. Very limited menu  good food small portions. Very casual.  Have wifi so you can hang out"}
{"text":"Very unique and healthy alternative to the norm here. Kale salad is superb! Portabella mushroom sandwich was on point the first time I orde reread it, but was severely let down the next time. It's a bit pricey but there's no price on eating healthy!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is always on point and I know I'm only putting good nourishment in with their organic selection.  Would highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Small shop. Very hard to find because it was located behind another business and it had no signs out on the road. I got a raspberry smoothie (I forgot the name). It was decent. I could see in the back while the lady was making my smoothie. They could use new blenders because hers wasn't blending very well. So the wait was longer than usual compared to smoothie king."}
{"text":"Great local organic lunch spot. My kids and I enjoyed our lunch. Wish more places used good ingredients like this place. Sure wish this was in Hickory!"}
{"text":"What a gem here in Gastonia. I come here on Saturdays for lunch and have never left disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome organic, vegetarian, and vegan selections! Nice atmosphere, good prices! Love that they're open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Food wise, this place is spectacular. Their food is what I call \"feel good food\". I never leave over stuffed and always leave happy. The only thing I'm bummed about is I went to their Facebook page this morning to check their hours- and went in only to find out they have a whole hour of not serving food but only doing smoothies and juice. It wasn't stated anywhere about that (not that I saw at least) and was super bummed because I wanted to bring a sandwich with me to work. Also, the woman working seemed kind of rude to me, and was acting like she didn't really want to be there. Normally she's really nice, so I didn't take this personally.. I really just wish they advertised that they're pretty much closed from 10-11 o clock unless you only want a smoothie. Otherwise this place is fantastic and a great atmosphere..."}
