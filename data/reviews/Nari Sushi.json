{"text":"Although it's not much to look at (inside or out), the food at Nari Sushi is actually quite good. I've been twice now and will definitely go back in the future. 

The couple working the bar were very friendly and prompt in preparing the food. There are a couple tables to sit at while you wait. Both times I ordered chirashi and my girlfriend got a veggie maki set, so I can't speak to much else on the menu. I was surprised to find the portions quite large and extremely tasty though, which was definitely a plus. Oh - and for those looking to grab n' go, they have prepared sushi sets at discount at the end of the business day. 

Definitely give Nari Sushi a shot."}
{"text":"The best and cheapest sushi I've ever tried. Those 8 rolls for $5 will make you full for hours.
Made freshly everyday as well. You can even watch the process."}
{"text":"I'll put it simply: the sushi here rivals some of the best sushi restaurants I've ever visited around Ontario.

Its a minute's walk from my college so I pass here when class is over to get some dinner to take home. I usually get two of their salmon/avocado roll sets (a total of 16 rolls with brown rice for $13). 

The sushi quality is fantastic. You can tell the ingredients are very fresh, especially the salmon. The rolls are HUGE in comparison to other rolls from other sushi places. They don't skimp out on the fish they put in your rolls too. The meat and vegetable pieces are very big. One complaint I have about the rolls is that they also tend to use quite a bit of rice (not excessively, but more than usual) and the rolls often fall apart. 

The older couple that works there (I assume they are the owners) are very nice and they remember their usuals. 

All in all, if you're thinking about eating here, go for it. Its a great little restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh sushi and good value. Perfect for picking up (they have a counter of pre-packed-sets-ready-to-go or you can call and order in advance). The restaurant isn't much to look at on the outside and the hours seem touch and go though - last time I went on a Friday evening and they were closed. Regardless, definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Fast, delicious and convenient location.

Not much else to say about it."}
{"text":"I am giving it a 4 star based on its price, quality and location. Honestly, if you are trying to spend less than $10 and expect high-class sushi, you are asking too much. I had a few sushi places here in Toronto and they were definitely pricier than this place but the quality was not as great. 

I work on Berkeley Street so this location was perfect for me. I had a friend who wanted to grab lunch near my work today and she was craving sushi so we just chose a place that was decently priced and close to my work. We came across Nari Sushi. At first, I was skeptical about this place since it's called Nari Sushi Take-Out. I got the Salmon & Avocado roll (8 pieces) for $5.60 including taxes. It was a great deal. 

The sushi was decent sized and at times the salmon pieces were huge, which I'm not complaining. The fish didn't smell bad like some cheap places. Considering its price and how much it filled me up, this place is totally worth it. I can see myself coming here for lunch when I don't mind walking to go eat."}
{"text":"This is amazing, I went in here on a whim when I had to eat something quick, and being deadset against Subway, this was the closest option.  I'm skeptical about sushi places, especially grab and go - but this was great!  I've had the salmon rolls twice now and both times they've been excellent.  Big pieces of very fresh salmon, big chunks of avocado, and not an excess of rice.  I wish this was closer to where I lived, since I've tried 5 sushi places in the vicinity there and couldn't find one that was as good as Nari's take away counter.  

All in all, I'd heartily recommend this tasty sushi at great prices."}
{"text":"2.5 quality 
sushi is esthetically average kind of sloppy and sushi is nevery intact.  also bulky.

taste wise id say a 3.  definately a good.place due to proximity from where i work.  and to be honest i am a frequent customer only based on convience only.  its nothing to rant and rave about except its sheer grab and go quality."}
{"text":"Look, I'm a fan of cheap sushi joints, but the reviews for Nari make it seem like a godsend. It's poorly made sushi that's been sitting at the counter for a while, at relatively normal maki roll prices.

Come here if you need a _very_ fast lunch at a decent price. The only caveat is that they go overboard on the rice, the rice itself doesn't seem sticky enough to hold its shape, and the fish quality seems just barely passable.

You're probably a 5-10 minute walk away from better sushi options, for very similar, if not equal, prices."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

It's a good on-the-go cheap eat if you're in a rush and if you work (or happen to be) in the area. It's not the best sushi, but the prices are affordable and you also get freshly made sushi for decent prices as well!"}
{"text":"I've always been hesitant to try these small sushi places and avoid getting take-out sushi, but I finally tried it today and it's not bad at all for a quick lunch. Definitely better than chain take-out sushi places at the mall. 

Salmon and Avocado Roll - $4.95 for 8 large pieces. Rolls were large not because of too much rice, but because the fatty salmon pieces are huge! 

I also got a miso soup, only has some seaweed in it but not bad."}
{"text":"#sushi #lunch #toronto #yelp

Great little take out joint near King and Sherbourne. It you work around this area, Nari Sushi is a must try; and I can almost guarantee that it will become your go-to spot for lunch.

For those worried that a sushi lunch may not be filling, let me inform you that their maki rolls are massive - 8 pieces of salmon avocado fills me up. 

For those who think sushi can be expensive, sure it can. Not this place though. Salmon Avocado is my regular and it's priced at only $4.95 (compared to $6.95 at most places).

I can't say the quality is bad either - I am going by taste and freshness. It's pretty top notch. 

Verdict? See the 5 stars? I'm about to become a regular!"}
{"text":"Great and affordable sushi place near George Brown College. They offer larger than normal sushi rolls at an awesome price. I really like the spicy salmon roll which is priced at 5.95 for 8 pieces. It's usually more than enough to fill me up in between lectures. Later on during the day they also have 30% (sometimes 50%!!) off which makes the already affordable sushi even more tempting!

There's not a lot of room to sit down but thankfully they primarily deal in grab & go sushi."}
{"text":"This is sushi for when you're in a lunch rush because it's economical and also because it falls apart. Aka Takeout sushi.

It's my last resort sushi.
 
It would be actually not that bad if it wasn't because the rolls all fall apart, abd turn my maki lunch into a poke bowl.

The sushi rolls are also rather small, I'd rather pay a dollar more and go to Ueno."}
{"text":"This is not \"great\" sushi. It's not even \"really good\" sushi. But it is definitely \"good\" sushi and for the price and convenience, we are big fans!

My boyfriend and I get takeout here probably once a week and our order usually has a spicy salmon and a salmon avocado roll. They're big rolls with lots of rice, and you're pretty lucky if each piece doesn't fall apart on you. Doesn't bother us - it's all part of the Nari sushi fun. But the price can't be beat and the salmon quality seems to be pretty good. They give you big pieces with each roll too. One roll (8 pieces) is usually enough for lunch/dinner, with maybe an extra order if we're pretty hungry. Ordered the sashimi once and it was great. The spicy salmon is really tasty too but has a ton of rice... But that doesn't bother me. I just pick some of it off.

Overall, a decent sushi place if you are looking for a quick bite for cheap!"}
{"text":"So I actually did end up returning for a second try, and I am really glad I did, because now I kind of get it. I knew the good people of Yelp wouldn't lead me astray/couldn't possibly have such bad taste, and now all my faith is restored. This time, I got the salmon & avocado sushi that so many people love, and I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised. It was only $4.50 for a box containing 8 very large pieces of sushi - good deal! Also, the salmon... unfff. The texture was perfect, kind of fatty but so fresh and buttery smooth. Delicious. And the sushi didn't fall apart at the slightest touch, unlike the first set I got here. In the end, I can say that Nari Sushi kind of managed to redeem itself with this particular offering. Basically, if you don't get the salmon & avocado sushi when you come here then you're definitely doing something wrong, because it really is very good while everything else is just mediocre."}
