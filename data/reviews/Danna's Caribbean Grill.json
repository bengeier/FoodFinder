{"text":"I thought I had good Caribbean food before. I was wrong. This place is the truth. If you want okay Caribbean food go to Danna's Caribbean Grill. authentic flavor, \"Tostones\" Authentic \"Cuban Sandwich\" \"Empanadas\" this is the only place to be.."}
{"text":"Best lunch value in Downtown! $8 for pulled pork sandwich, fries AND a drink. Food delicious and servings generous. Only downside is eating in a shared space with 2 music systems blaring-not much ambience. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've now been here twice, and it keeps getting better. Both times, I ordered the stuffed tostones, once with beef (ropa vieja) and once with pork (lechon). Not sure which was better, but they were both great. For $8, you get five big pieces of plantains topped with meat and cheese. More than enough for a meal! And on my second visit, they added a tasty side of garlic aioli, which gave the pork an extra kick.  I can't wait to try other items on the menu, especially the garlic-achiote marinated chicken breast and the Cuban sandwich (although the latter has salami on it as well as the traditional pork and ham; not sure how that's gonna taste!)  Not the greatest ambiance, because it shares its dining area with another counter-service joint, but the food is fast and fresh and overall delicious! Glad to see Caribbean food represented so well in downtown Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great salsa music in the background. Definitely a place to visit and eat if in the downtown Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have a Cuban sandwich that is awesome! It is super yummy and HUGE! The meal comes with seasoned fries and a drink. The fries are a treat by themselves, but the sauce that comes with them is frighten awesome!"}
{"text":"Really tasty Cuban food at a very reasonable price. Love the beef empanadas and the Cuban sandwich.    Definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"What use to be Danas Carribean grill is now Mr. Wok.  With an added Chinese menu, it does bring some variety.  For myself, I love Asian food.  And for it to be conveniently nearby is a plus.  They do still have a small menu of the Caribbean grill.  Their Maduros is one of my favs when I'm in the mood for sweet bananas.  This place is hit or miss.  I tend to come here when I'm in the mood for chicken.  I've ordered the grilled chicken wings a few times and chicken tenders which I think is alright.  I've had their Asian Chicken Salad which I wasn't impressed with the way it was prepared and the price of it.   Today, I tried the Sweet n' Sour Pork.  So I pictured that my meal would be full of pork with rice and noodles as of I were placing an order at Panda Express.  It had a similar concept, but I didn't care for how the salad was in the same container.  For the price of $7.99 which is close to a two item combo at Panda, you'd get the same deal, except the salad here is your second item which I don't think anyone would really want to pay that much for a small side of salad which they don't put enough salad dressing.  Which is one of the reasons why I didn't enjoy the Asian Chicken Salad I ordered in the past for $12.99.    With my meal, I asked if they could do half rice and half chow mein and they said they could.  I took a fork twirled with noodles and OMG, it tasted like the noodles had been soaking in soy sauce or something salty.  The rice was salty too but tolerable and edible enough.  I did enjoy the sweet and sour pork though.  I wish it came with more for the price.  A few of the menu item prices, I think should be reevaluated.   So with all that being said, happy eatings!"}
{"text":"This place has the best food you will ever try. If you think you've tried the best your wrong. This place will leave you wanting to come back the next day guaranteed."}
{"text":"Best cuban food in Vegas!!!!! Everything it's made from scratch.... love this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like it from the outside but this place is AMAZING!!!!! I had the carribean BBQ pulled prom sandwich. It was fantastic. The fries were good too. And the prices are really low. I am very pleased."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef empanadas and beans/rice to be delivered. The beef empanadas were great, but I was really upset at the fact that the beans/rice had pork in it. I don't eat pork and on the menu it didn't say that it was made with pork so it was very upsetting because I didn't realize until I ate some of the beans/rice. They need to really list all the ingredients because I just wasted my money because I can't eat it."}
