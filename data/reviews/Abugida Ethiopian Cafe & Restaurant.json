{"text":"Great new Ethiopian restaurant on Central!  Beautifully decorated with interesting art inside.  Very warm and inviting.  An old house that was converted to a restaurant.
We had the Vegetarian Delight, a very reasonably priced sampler (the red lentils are awesome).  Our friends got the beef tibs and said it was excellent.  Service was attentive.  Very clean and the unisex bathroom (HB2 be gone!!) smelled wonderful.  Check it out y'all!"}
{"text":"It was my first time and I had an awesome experience!  The food was amazing I highly recommend the feast but you can not eat it by yourself bring some friends with you."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch ; had the Abugida feast - good for 2 - we loved it !!
Great service - The hostess was warm and welcoming.
Tip: try the Ethiopian tea - it had all sorts of goodness in it ."}
{"text":"I forever heart the vegetarian feast!  My crew fully loves Ethiopian food, and this may be my favorite Ethiopian restaurant of all time.  I just went to a top rated restaurant in D.C., and this was sooo much better.  Wonderful flavors, the right amount of spice, and so fresh! My seven year old asked if we could eat here every day! We will be back. Please bring your friends and share the word--we want this new restaurant to thrive!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu!! The lentils are my favorite but again everything is so very good!! And it's really inexpensive compared to the amount of food you get. A great gastronomic experience!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the vegetarian feast and added the beef stew. Everything was so delicious and the service was amazing. They explained everything and made sure to check on us. The Ethiopian coffee at the end was a great finish. Love this addition to plaza midwood, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience eating Ethiopian. Had the lunch buffet and tried everything I had room for and some. Couldn't really tell you exactly what any of it was called but there was a beef dish with berebere that I will be back for. The spicy lentils were especially delicious as well. If there are vegetarians or those gluten free'ers in your crew, they won't be disappointed with this place. There are options for everyone.

The staff was awesome and very helpful to us first timers. I think they got a good laugh watching me try to eat with my hands. I think I wore as much as I ate. Both service and food were excellent. Looking forward to trying the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Okay so I Love when I can give a great review and this is one of those times. We drove 2.5 hours from Georgia to Charlotte to try the food at this place. Note we were not disappointed. The staff was super friendly and checked on us just the right amount of times. The location does not look like much on the outside but it is homey, neat and clean on the inside. The food. Where do I start? So, the only recommendation I have is to cook the cabbage and potatoes a little longer but that is truly a preference on my part. I like them both pretty soft. All of the flavors blended wonderfully and the lamb (see pic) was super yummy. I fell in Love with their Doro Alecha- the chicken was so tender and all of the flavors blended wonderfully! I more than recommend this spot if your are in the Charlotte area and looking for some genuinely delicious Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"Abugida is definitely my favorite Ethiopian.....granted, it is the only Ethiopian food I have tried! My husband and I finally decided to check out Abugida Sunday around lunch.

Prior to coming here, I had done my research and read the reviews. I knew what to expect in terms of ambiance, lack of utensils, etc. While walking in, there were two things I noticed. 1. The restaurant felt like a home. Like settling in to dinner at Grandma's kind of feel. 2. The aroma while walking in hit you so hard that you knew you were in for a good meal! 

I did notice that they have added beer and wine to the menu, which is a nice touch. It also looked like there was Ethiopian beer on the menu. We settled on the Abugida feast with chicken.

The feast came out after about 25-30 minutes (I noticed this wait time was consistent but the place is small so it makes sense) and I immediately figured out this was too much food for my husband and I....we definitely gave it our best effort though and almost finished! Everything was soooooo delicious. Yes, it was messy but it was so good. Candidly, I have no idea what I was eating but it was all fantastic and we just went for it. 

Additionally, my husband got the Ethiopian coffee which was super tasty. They brew the coffee in a big ceramic pitcher when you order it.

Overall, delish food. I left crazy full. Absolutely unique experience."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Friendly service and delicious food. We got two vegetarian samplers (came on one plate) and it was soooo good. Loved the simple vibe inside. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food had some really great flavors and the service was phenomenal. The staff was super sweet and accommodating.

Here's what I ordered:

Ethiopian Hot Tea-super delicious. You can tell that the tea consisted of real ingredients such as cinnamon sticks and cloves. 

Abugida Feast w/ Doro Wet(chicken)-the flavors were really great. My gripe was with the potatoes and chickpeas which were undercooked. That was a texture that I didn't enjoy, however, the seasoning was on point. The Doro Wet sauce had a little kick of spice that was nice and a ric thick consistency. The chicken itself didn't have much chicken flavor nor much flavor from the sauce. It was as though it was boiled (without seasoning) and then added to the sauce right before serving.

Kitfo-It didn't click in my mind that this was mid- rare MINCED meat and not steak cubes. I was expecting something completely different, but had to check myself once I re-read the item description. It tasted like mid-rare..minced...meat..like the menu says lol. I wasn't ready. There were no strong flavors. In fact I brought it home with the intention of cooking it until it's well done and seasoning it to my liking. I wasn't too fond of this item, but it may be good if cooked until well done.

Rice- I ordered my dishes with rice because I am not a fan of the injera bread, which is the traditional accompaniment. The rice was slamming. It was extra long grain white rice with some nice aromatic action going on. I got some to go.

Ethiopian Coffee-I'm not a coffee person, but wanted to have the experience. The coffee had notes of cocoa and had a bit of a bitter after taste which was, surprisingly, quite nice.

I'll be back again to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and it was delicious!  We got the vegetarian feast, Kitfo, and Shiro Wat.  Everything was spot on, we've had Ethiopian food before and this was easily some of the best.   All the veggies were fresh and the quality was outstanding.  Our server was great, we really wanted to try the Shiro Wat so she suggested we just order 1 vegetarian feast, the Kitfo, and Shiro Wat instead of two vegetarion feasts.  That was a good idea, we already couldn't finish all the food and ordering two feasts would have been entirely too much!    Don't hesitate, go here, and if you've never had Ethiopian food, this place would be an excellent introduction.  Looking forward to are next visit!"}
{"text":"First time eating Ethiopian. Very nice building. Hostess was friendly and made sure you had what you needed. Love hand sanitizer at every table since there are no utensils to eat with. Food was ok. It would have been nice to have thicker, stronger napkins then the thin cocktail ones to clean your hands off with."}
{"text":"Amazing food! And very filling! First place I looked up when I arrived in town for vegan food. They had reasonable prices and very friendly service. Will be back."}
{"text":"I visited Abugida with my dining club, QC Vibes Dining Club. Abugida does not accept reservations. However, when we arrived with our party of 8 they were quite accommodating. 

Everyone but myself was new to Ethiopian cuisine. The staff kindly explained the menu. In order to try various flavors, we ordered 3 of the feast options to share. The staff provided guidance on how to dine properly with injera.

The food was amazing. The service was excellent. The restaurant is cozy and feels like dining in someone's home. I will certainly return soon!"}
{"text":"I love Abugida's cafe'Ethopian foods. The Vegetarian is the best in Charlotte. Each morsel is tender, tasty and delicious. You must try the lamb, cabbage and Njeri is fresh."}
{"text":"Had the buffet. Everything was fresh and tasty. Even hubby who was reluctant to try the food enjoyed all he ate."}
{"text":"This was such an amazing dinner I had with two friends. We split the vegetarian feast, shiro and lamb tins and I can't stop thinking about how delicious it was! The service was great too - friendly and prompt. The atmosphere was homey and inviting. We stayed there for a while enjoying our meal and conversation. We ate more than our fill and left extremely satisfied! I 100% would recommend this cute restaurant if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Not surprising that they have all five stars reviews, terrific food, service, everything you would want from an Ethiopian meal. Had the vegetarian feast and added on the only veggie option that wasn't included and it was much more than enough for two people. Make sure to get an Ethiopian coffee if you like super strong java, which I definitely do. Oh, and super cheap, not surprisingly. Our whole meal was $22! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Charlotte is so lucky, we have a lot of great Ethiopian restaurants, I truly like every one of them, but Abugida has to be tops on the list.  It covers all the bases. Great service, delicious food at a reasonable price. Parking can be a little dicey, so you might have to park across the street or next door.

If you haven't tried Ethiopian before, fear not, they will help you decipher the menu. Don't miss out on the coffee service if you are a coffee lover."}
{"text":"I went to dinner here with some friends recently and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. None of us are very familiar with Ethiopian food, but our waitress walked us through every step of the meal which was great!

My friend and I split the vegetarian feast with a side of homemade cottage cheese and our two other friends had meat platters. Everything was incredibly flavorful and the portions were very generous. 

The ambiance was relatively minimal but still comfortable and as tables filled up around us it began to feel more cozy. Every staff person was very warm and friendly as well."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty. We had the beef and the veggie feast--both very good. It appears to be a family-run restaurant and has good service. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Finally some authentic flavors and another cuisine to try.  I had a good experience getting some to go but I would recommend eating there.  Keep an open mind and try stuff and enjoy. I went straight for the most authentic dish but this place is great for vegetarians and vegan's. I love eating with my hands , this is how I grew up eating South Indian food. Familiar flavor and vibes."}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant. All the family was there when I came in for lunch, and the service was excellent!

This is my first time eating Ethiopian food, so please bear with me.

I ordered the vegetarian feast, which came with 6 different diches. The all tasted good, but they were a little too \"mushy\". The red lentils were my favorite. Honestly, the food tasted really good. It was spicy, but good spicy.
The dishes all come with a side of what looks like a very thin sour pancake, I have mixed feelings about the taste and texture of this \"bread\". 
They did not bring any silverware with my food, so I tried going \"local\" and eating with my hands. All you do is cut a piece of the bread and use it to grab the other food, but after two bites, I decided to order a fork (they have plastic forks in the back).

Now, the place. It looks kind of sketchy from the outside, but the inside is very clean. It is just and old house that was transformed into a restaurant. I think they still have some rooms there..."}
{"text":"The food and super friendly service earn this a five star rating. The wonderful smells hot you right as you walk in. 

Not fancy, but. Lean, well lite, and great food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! The first thing that hit me when I walked in was the smell of freshly roasted coffee from their coffee ceremony. The food is amazing, and overall it was just a great experience."}
{"text":"Some of the best Ethiopian food I've had. I ordered the doro wat. The chicken was tender, the stew was spicy and richly flavored, and there were generous portions of cottage cheese and chickpeas on the side. The presentation was attractive too. I also ordered the Ethiopian coffee, which was delicious and made me realize how awful most other coffee tastes. The service was extremely polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Best food ever. Great service and great price. Felt very much at home in the place. The bread was soft and plentiful. I can't wait to go eat again! So wonderful. We will be regulars for sure! It is also vegan and healthy so dont feel bad eating too much"}
{"text":"My husband, friend and I finally made it in to Abugida for lunch this past Saturday. It's a great lunch spot! Warm, helpful and friendly staff welcome you into thier \"home\". The converted home is the restaurant. It sort of reminded me of the layout of Copper but there is a small kitchen area in the corner where coffee is made/served. There is an area where the coffee service is performed as well. 
It was warm out so we all got water and two if us got the veggie combo and my husband got the meat one. The meat combo is the veggie combo but then they come out with a hard-boiled egg and braised chicken and a spicy chili sauce that they add to the veggie platter. 
The veggies are not spicy as in hot but they certainly taste delicious and they bring you all the injera to scoop it up with that your heart could desire!
The cook/owner came out after our meal was done and asked how everything was and she had said she hadn't done any marketing yet and this was all word-of-mouth and yelp. Go visit!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Basic decor but there is some cool artwork and items from Ethiopia. This was my first real experience eating Ethiopian and I liked it. Seems like getting one of the feast platters is the way to go, and share with a friend. The staff is friendly and I also learned a lot about Ethiopian culture. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"This was a really interesting place to eat. We were looking for something new and different and came across here. We didn't really know what to expect, but they recommended different options and explained what was good. We really liked it, but it was definitely different from anything we were used to. I had the vegetarian platter and I think I enjoyed my plate most out of all of us. I'd recommend this place though!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Used to live in Los Angeles, adjacent to little Ethiopia - Abugida is easily on par with the best of the restaurants. I have to admit, I almost always get the same thing - Beef Tibs, wet, medium spicy - but I literally have cravings for it. Like, stop what I am doing, get up and go to the Cafe cravings. Best part, generous servings :)  The family that owns this restaurant is wonderful - genuinely friendly and understandably proud of their great food!"}
{"text":"This is the highest rated of the many Ethiopian foods in Charlotte and I can see why.  Wifey and I took the Mother out to finally try This delicious cuisine and we weren't disappointed.  They shared the vegetarian feast full of various vegetable and lentil items on a bed of injeera with extra on the side.  I did the doro wat with some fresh Ethiopian cheese on the side, which was just fantastic. If you know what paneer is, it's basically a crumbled version.  I had to drop one star as they ran out of Ethiopian coffee but we would go back to re-try any time.  The service was great and they really wanted to make sure we enjoyed everything. You can tell they really care about what the put out in front of their customers. That's why it was packed even at 8:30 at night. The Mother was very impressed"}
{"text":"Abugida is the very definition of a hidden gem: still rough around the edges, ambiance-wise, but who cares? Their food is amazing and the owners and staff are really friendly.

I feel like this is the type of place that will make its reputation on great food, then follow that up by perhaps renovating or moving to improve the \"experience\" factor. I'm rooting for them 100% and have referred several friends and family there. 

A close friend of the family is from Eritrea and has owned and operated a very successful Ethiopian/Eritean restaurant in the northeast. So, we know good Ethiopian food when we see it, and this is very good!"}
{"text":"Came to Charlotte for a class and ended up for dinner at Abugida. I love Ethiopian food and we have one back in my area. The food here is fresh, flavorful and they give decent portions. My husband and kids loved the food. I do like the food but I think I like Awaze in Cary a tad better over this. But nevertheless if it's your first time trying Ethiopian you will surely love it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Ethiopian in Charlotte! I've been to several Ethiopian restaurants in town, and this one is without a doubt the best! The restaurant is light, open, warm, and inviting! The service is friendly and attentive! You cannot eat here and not feel welcomed and happy. The injera is the freshest I've ever had. The kitfo is my favorite and was seasoned perfectly with just the right level of spiciness. The portions are very generous for the price and you will not leave hungry. If you've never had Ethiopian, step out of your comfort zone and head to Abugida Cafe."}
{"text":"Ethiopian food is my favorite and this place does not disappoint!  The staff are so friendly and the dishes are tasty!  I recommend the feast options."}
{"text":"Absolutely a wonderful find.  It was my girlfriend and my first Ethiopian experience.  The food was very flavorful and fun to sample the vegetable platter and eat with our hands.  The waiter and waitress we so attentive and were genuinely vested in our enjoyment of the experience.  Very kind and wonderful people.  

The dining area was pretty busy including couples, locals, Ethiopians and even families (we were impressed seeing the younger kids be so adventurous and genuinely loving it).

This is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot! My husband and I went here for an early Sunday supper on a whim and we were not disappointed. We knew we were going to have a great experience the second we walked in because (1) the smell of the food was intoxicating and (2) nearly all of the patrons were Ethiopian (always a great sign of an authentic place). 

My husband and I were both very hungry and tend to be big eaters, so we figured we'd start with the house platter with steak. Oh my gosh, so good and so filling! We thought we'd be ordering more food for a second course, but we were stuffed to the gills after splitting this one $18 platter. What a deal!

The service was friendly and the ambiance is very casual, like most places in the area. We will definitely be back. Next time we'd love to try some Ethiopian wine or beer too, and we'll definitely be bringing friends!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and very reasonably priced. 
The service was excellent.

I order the vegetarian feast and a hot tea.

Everything was delicious and exceeded my expectations. Surprisingly It was very filling, to the point i could finish it and had to take it home."}
{"text":"Great spot for Ethiopian cuisine!  We tried the combination plate."}
{"text":"Once you step in and take a deep breath, you can smell that you've made the right decision. I'm not sure of al the spices used in the food, but it comes together beautifully. 

The decor is simple but cool, beautiful African portraits hang on the dark peach colored walls. The small dining area is very clean, very very clean which I appreciate. 

I really enjoyed the vegetarian platter and don't let the fact that it's a plate of vegetables fool you, you WILL get full. This Ethiopian cuisine reminds me of soul food, just seasoned the way Ethiopians prefer if that makes sense. So it's potatoes, collared greens , lentils, etc . You can eat with your hands or ask for a fork. If you choose hands, you use the Injera to scoop your food. I chose fork this time because I had a manicure with sheer lacquer and the food will temporarily stain your nails if you use your fingers. 

When you've tried an entree , try the warm herbal tea they have as well. Amazing spice!"}
{"text":"Wow!   This dining experience transported me to a different land.  I left Charlotte and went straight to Ethiopia!  After reading the glowing YELP Reviews, this place became a priority for me.  So much to review.  First the menu and food - extremely different than American fare, based on presentation and FLAVORS.  I had the vegetable plate which was a sampling of many kinds of vegetables.  It was served with a basket of rolled up spongy bread.  Because there are no utensils, the bread is unrolled and used to scoop up the food.  This takes practice and getting used to.  The experience was fascinating, but probably not good for someone trying to avoid bread. I feel confident that utensils would have been available upon request, however my recommendation is to experience Ethiopian food the way that the natives eat it!   The iced tea had strong hints of Cinnamon and ginger and was simply delicious.  The entire meal woke up every taste bud in my mouth.  Atmosphere - very warm colors and artwork that added to the feeling of being in Ethiopia.  There was only one other table of people dining for lunch today and when they left, we had the entire restaurant to ourselves.  It was a pleasant and comfortable space.   Service - impeccable.  The waiter was as hospitable as it gets.  Explained all the menu options and helped us understand the technique for eating the food. His native accent also added to the feeling of being outside of Charlotte.  So, in summation, I loved the experience and so glad that Charlotte has another dining option that is not a boring chain restaurant.  For those reading this review, GO CHECK OUT THIS PLACE!  Three thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic, hole in the wall Ethiopian joint!!!

Went with some Yelp friends and had the Abugida feast (with Beef and Chicken)! A great way to sample a little bit of everything. The flavor of the beef was amazing but those spicy lentils were out of this world.

Very helpful and friendly staff and very reasonable prices.

Great place for a food adventure to get you out of your comfort zone and try something new! I didn't know the names of anything I was eating but it was all good!!!!

Hear they have an awesome coffee ceremony!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing !!! We had the veggie combo and it was to die for and the service is awesome too"}
{"text":"Want an 'outside the box' experience?  You'll find one here.  Wife and I always like to try new things and even though she'd eaten Ethiopian style food before I had not and therefore we ventured to this new place for a change from the norm.

While you will not find any trendy seating or decor, what I can confirm is that you will find some of the best and freshest ingredients and food I've eaten in a while.  The service, like others have mentioned, was super pleasant and very eager to explain and answer questions we might have had.

Don't come here expecting some sexy, romantic or upscale atmosphere.  Come here to eat clean, fresh and incredible cultural cuisine.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has a family restaurant feel. It's definitely not your typical American style restaurant. We had the shiro, vegi combo and timatit Fitfit (tomato salad soaked with their flat bread And lemon and sauce) As a vegan I get a trill from discovering new restaurants and Ethiopian food is a vegans best friend."}
{"text":"Authentic and scrumptious Ethiopian. Fabulous lunch buffet with most of the menu on it. Amazing food run by a kind family. If you've never tried Ethiopian it's worth the experience (no silver ware and all)!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place .. Served authentic food Nd the service was very good. .. I recommend this place for people seeking different cuisines."}
{"text":"First time here, and first time having Ethiopian food. I loved it. Service was very helpful and friendly. I cannot wait to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The food is delicious and the service is super friendly. 

During my most recent visit, I took my sister in for her birthday. It was her first time having Ethiopian. The people who work here we so friendly. They seemed just as excited as my sister, explaining the dishes and cooking styles; they seemed to really take pride in what they were doing. 

And they SHOULD take pride, because did I mention that the food is delicious!? The vegetarian feast is my favorite. I've also tried the zelzel wat (I think that's what it's called -- it's the beef) and homemade cottage cheese. All of it very yummy. 

The vibe is very cozy, almost like going to a friend's for lunch. I can imagine parking being a hassle if they had a rush of customers but I've never had a problem. That said, delivery from here is just as tasty as dine-in so don't let a little laziness get in the way of enjoying a good meal -- go ahead and have someone deliver it to you ;)

I hope this place does well. Seems like some really great people running it and I so love Ethiopian food! Definitely check it out, whether you are a long time fan of Ethiopian or a first timer, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"One of the best Ethiopian food places I've ever been. Their injera is pretty delicious. Their veg platter has got 6 different gravies and they are all very good."}
{"text":"Just walking in, the place smells fantastic. Great food. Warm, welcoming atmosphere. First timers try the feast. Great to bring a date."}
{"text":"Nothing short of 5 stars. Food was excellent, service was very friendly. Went there for my wife's birthday lunch it  was well worth it. We were the first ones for their first ever lunch buffet , food was awesome, good variety. To top it off, they gave cake at the end of the lunch for her birthday - the cake was wonderful! We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Ethiopian food seasoning is similar to Indian food. You can have if mild up to spicy. The vegetable plates are very similar to southern veggi plate. Only difference is the spongy flat bread, call injera. It has a slight sour taste to it. Tibs are meat dishes sautéed with vegetables. Their beef Tibs are very flavorful, it's a combination of spice with a touch of lemon and cinnamon taste. The zilzil wat, is a stew. It was okay. Too much fat for my taste. Ethiopian coffee takes time to make. Be aware it is very strong coffee, but smooth. They have a cappuccino machine if you want the typical coffee. 
The owners are very nice and helpful. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great price, amazing food and a very fun and friendly vibe. I also love the authentic Ethiopian jazz. Needless to say I'll be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place so much.  Authentic food that's incredibly delicious plus very kind and sweet spirited service.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"This is one of Central Avenue's hidden gems! Authentic Ethiopian dishes that are fantastic! I can't emphasize enough how flavorful the food is here!

My recommendation is to go with 2-4 people and order family style for the table.  Get the \"Vegetarian Feast\" with an order of \"Kitfo\".  The \"beef tips\" are good and you should definitely try them at some point but the Kitfo is better in my opinion.  It's minced beef with butter and spices and it's delicious.  

Plenty of food for 4 people to share at a great price.

For beer drinkers they have a solid Ethiopian Lager that goes well with the spices."}
{"text":"SUCH a hidden gem. I had never had Ethiopian before and now can't get enough. Amazing spices and unique variations of familiar vegetables. Come with an appetite and get the vegetarian or Abugida feast. The owner and staff are are so welcoming and accommodating."}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful meal here last night. Everyone in our group of eight was a beginner so we went 100% with the recommendations. It was amazing; delicious and fun. Eating from a shared plate is a really powerful way to enjoy a meal with people. It's the kind of connection too frequently missing from our fast paced world. I look forward to going back and becoming more familiar with the menu items, everything was delicious and in new ways."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot.  This is one of those restaurants that will be a staple, if it isn't already.  
I travel a lot and America has become a stamp over and over.  Same, same, same.  
This is different.
My experience was that it brings several different cultural experiences together and makes you break social barriers.  Go here with people you don't know well and watch what happens.
Flavors are familiar yet new."}
{"text":"Outstandingly tasty and friendly service too. We had the Abugida Feast and the Vegetarian Feast at our table which gives you some of about everything. These two dishes were more than enough to make 4 people really full and satisfied. I hope this new restaurant makes it because it is excellent and provides something different than the usual Charlotte fare."}
{"text":"Wow! Never had Ethiopian food before but I can't imagine it being any better than this. We ordered the vegetarian feast and the beef tips to share between my husband and me and it was flavorful, spicy, and overall delicious. This place really exceeded our expectations. Besides the food, the staff was so friendly and charming. They spent time at our table talking to us and explaining the menu. We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing! It is in an old house, but is so clean on the inside. I've had Ethiopian in a few different states (and DC) here, and in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and their injera rivals them all! My husband and I split the vegetarian feast and beef tibs and ate until we couldn't anymore. Very authentic and the owner/chef was so nice! We spoke with her and they still get all of their spices from back home. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best Ethiopian FOOD in NC!!!!!!! 

My God I truly am addicted to this place thank God the price is very reasonable. I recommend everything but my #1 is Derek Tips (Dry beef Tibs) with Gomen and Aybe (cabbage and home made cottage cheese). Warning  this is super addictive but like I said the price complements my budget."}
{"text":"First Yelp review because the food was amazing!!! Can't wait to come back! Had the feast and let me tell you, DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Wish I could give it 10 stars!!! Thanks Abugida!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and about as authentic as it gets. Best coffee we've ever had. The family that runs the place is super nice."}
{"text":"The kitfo made here is the best on the east coast!!!  The vegetables are all very greasy and seasoned to perfection!"}
{"text":"Love the vegetarian feast and their hot tea! Their njeera isn't too dry which is.. a basic requirement."}
{"text":"A generous three stars here. We're usually totally on the same page with Yelp on ratings. Not really sure what Yelpers were thinking rating this five stars though. It's almost like we didn't go to the same restaurant. The food was OK, but nothing to write home about. (BUT, this is our first try at Ethiopian, so maybe to us Ethiopian food in general is just OK). That was the good part. Now for the bad: they offer NO ALCOHOL at this restaurant. What's worse, they charge a $5 corkage fee for bringing your own bottle! This was a Saturday night out! Mama needs her wine. There are also no appetizer or dessert options. Which leads me to my next con: the service was horrible. They were nice, but sooooo slooooow. With nothing to munch on, we were starved by the time they brought out our food (about 30 minutes after ordering). In the end, it was an interesting exotic experience, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent Ethiopian food in a cozy, home-like atmosphere. The waitstaff/owners are really charming and genuinely want you to have an amazing experience at their restaurant. 

Interior is spotlessly clean and the only thing Abugida is lacking at present is desserts and a liquor license. They're working on the liquor license so soon you'll be able to enjoy a cool glass of honey wine with your food.

Don't miss out on their sampler platter which is a good value and the best way to sample a variety of dishes. They serve a delicious collard greens + house made Ethiopian fresh cheese dish which is very unique; we have never encountered this dish before and we eat Ethiopian food frequently. 

All in all Abugida is a great place for people who are addicted to Ethiopian food or people who are trying it for the first time...and everyone in between. It's a gem and a great addition to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Abugida Feast was fantastic, also got the one vegetable dish that doesn't come with the feast (forgot what it was called). Did NOT forget how it tasted. Whatever that dish is, don't think - order it, it's awesome."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of mom and pop shops and I absolutely loved this place. The hostess was very personable and made us feel at home. If it's your first time here, you should try the Abugida feast(two can share) it has all the essentials and it's a good value. I had the Doro wet myself which I thought was perfect and do not get me started on the injera, they were so soft I could sleep on them(apparently the mom makes it from scratch).  We were there for a casual Friday lunch and the rest of the group, who were trying Ethiopian cuisine for the first time, loved the food. I'm definitely going back again with my family!"}
{"text":"As we were seated, I overheard a woman behind us say she'd driven past this place in the morning and could smell what was cooking, and knew all day this was what she wanted to eat, and that's when I knew we'd made the right choice. Abugida is a family operation through and through and like all the best Ethiopian restaurants, has the feeling of being a guest at the family table. From the warm, friendly service to the familiar foods prepared with the personal touch of the chef, it might not be fancy but every bite is comfort and delight! The menu is broad, offering choices for omnivores, vegetarians and vegans alike, and options to please people new to the cuisine as well as those experienced with it. The spouse and I each ordered a vegetarian sampler as well as some shiro wat, which proved to be a smart move because the shiro wat at Abugida is some of the most enjoyable I've tried. All the food was delicious, making the long drive back to Raleigh seem even longer since we'd locked the leftovers in the trunk in order to have some cold for breakfast - definitely an underrated part of the Ethiopian food experience! If you want food that will please the spirit and the palate alike, treat yourself to a seat at the table of Abugida."}

{"text":"The food is wonderful. Great taste and nice atmosphere. We had the  Doro wet, Beef tibs, and the vegetarian feast. All of it was great!"}
{"text":"After hearing about Abugida Cafe- I had to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. Not only was our waitress extremely friendly, she was also patient and willing to help walk us through our experience and make recommendations. 

We ordered the kitfo, beef tips, and Abugida feast with chicken and it was plenty of food for the four of us. 

The Ethiopian bread made for the perfect utensil and I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with friends! All of our first times having Ethiopian, and oh my goodness it did not disappoint! We split the Abugida Feast (veggie platter with choice of meat), the Veggie platter, Shiro Wat (lentil dish), and another lentil dish that I'm afraid I can't remember the name of. (Tons of vegan options for my fellow veggies!) 

Everything was explained so well, the service was great! And the food was incredible-- fresh and flavorful. Absolutely everything we had was delicious, especially the curry chicken, and shiro wat. 

Already can't wait to come back again with more people!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to try this restuarant and we went tonight the service and food was really good. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic variety of flavors & textures. This place is a gem! We felt like family, as the staff welcomed us and told us about the history and culture of this delicious food. Coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Hooray- a terrific Ethiopian restaurant close to my home.  The friendliest owner.  Get either veg or non-veg \"feast\" for a sampling of food.  The chicken that comes with the non-veg platter is delicious, so is the beef (you can choose one).  The beef has a bit of heat, the chicken dish is child-friendly.   Get the Shiro- a creamy red lentil stew.  It is luxurious.  The non-veg feast plus the shiro is enough for 3-4 people.
Good Ethiopian food takes a little time.  Don't wait until you're starving to get there, it will take 15-20 minutes for your food to come out."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Ethiopian restaurant I've been in town. Food was home made and delicious! Service was second to none-making you feel like home! The Ethiopian hot tea and Ethiopian coffee are both wonderful. Entree wise, I like ZelZel Wet the most, but almost everything on the menu is good! Explore and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in North Carolina. I'd recommend the shiro,  but make sure to ask about the lamb tibs."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here last night. My first time experiencing Ethiopian food and it was fantastic! Server was special as she was the daughter of the chef and most informative. Highly recommend this cafe."}
