{"text":"Decent food. Had the bibimbap , fried shrimp and beef bulgogi. Pretty good except for the rice that was more under cooked than I like.
No liquor license."}
{"text":"This was a great Korean spot!! We tried the bim bim bap and the spicy fried chicken. Both were amazing!! Hardly any wait at all."}
{"text":"Recently started to work around the area and went there to eat lunch a few times. Every time, I ordered something different and they were all very good. The best is the dolsot bibimbap so far. Service is very good."}
{"text":"The food really was amazing - definitely 5 stars. We had the dumplings as an appetizer. I enjoyed the crispy fried chicken. It was cooked perfectly, was a great balance of spicy and sweet, and a huge portion! My husband had the bulgogi which was also a nice sized portion and served with rice and salad.

The issue was that we waited FOREVER for our food - I think it took an hour from when we sat down to when we received our appetizer. After that, things sped up, and we were offered a complimentary miso soup in recognition of the delay. For whatever reason, the restaurant was having trouble keeping up with the customers, to the point that they closed their doors earlier than normal. 

Given the very high quality of the food, I will definitely give them another try and hope that the slow service was a fluke!"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at a Korean restaurant in Montreal. I am used to having many side dishes (banchan) in NYC so was surprised with just a side of fresh kimchee. However, I was pleased with the main dish. I ordered the fish cake soup and my friend the stone bowl bibimbap, it came with a small side of miso soup. Everything was made well. 

This place is built suitable with the French Canadian in mind in my opinion. Not too much food but just the right amount. Water was served in wine glasses. Big spoons that are usually not used in a Korean household. 
The interior of this corner restaurant showed some traditional paintings coupled with the modern glass artwork, with cute figurines from Korea. 
They also have an appetizer menu and dessert menu. It is dimly lit. Casual but not too casual."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Our table ordered five different dishes and they were all really good - Dolsot Bibimbap, ailes de poulet, sundubu, kimchijjigae and the mango tart.  Prices were also more than reasonable and the inside well decorated and clean.  Very much recommended if you are looking for good authentic Korean food at a reasonable price and in a good setting."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. I have been ordering food from here since it opened up and I crave it every few days!! My favourite thing to eat from here is Dakgangjung; Korean sweet chilli sauce flavoured crispy fried chicken with Rice!! Definitely one of the better Korean places in Montreal."}
{"text":"It's one of the rare korean place in the Plateau so we were really happy to try it. It just opened so it is pretty quiet (we were the only two customers in the place the whole time on a tuesday night from 8 to 9 pm). Unlike the other korean restaurants, they don't blast kpop on tvs, so if you're looking for that, it is not the right place. The food was pretty good (we had tobokki and bibimbap). I don't think it would be part of my top korean restaurants but as the only one around the plateau, it is a pretty good spot."}
{"text":"Not a huge selection but all the necessary items are on the menu.

Didn't seat in to eat so can't judge the service. Took 3 dishes to go and all 3 were pretty good. 

The seafood tofu stew wasn't that spicy and flavour was good. Had 2 giant shrimps in and a few pieces of calamari. 

Japchae was also good...not too salty.

The chicken wings were very crispy and juicy.

Price is fair."}
{"text":"A new Korean place in my hood? Excellent. Now I was a bit worried with the history of average restaurants in this building but we had to try. We tried the Sundubu sea food stew and the Jeyuk Deopbab (spicy pork) which came with rice and salad. The service was nice, prompt and attentive. I enjoyed the pork dish very much, it was spicy as promised and the Stew was very good too. I am very happy to have this option so close, since our favorite Korean is in Westmount. I think it might be 4 stars but it will have to wait until I come back and try the Korean BBQ and the........... Korean fried chicken. Yes, sweet...so excited to have Korean fried chicken in the hood. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Had 3 dishes here and all were really good. The spicy pork stew was thin slices of fairly lean pork served in a rich sweet spicy gravy. Spice factor was like 4 chilies out of 10, it was very flavorful but not very spicy. The spicy fried chicken was served in a tangy sticky tomatoey sauce, was delicious but also not too spicy, maybe like 5 chilies out of 10. Lastly the seafood pancake. It was perfectly cooked (tender inside not raw, hot and crispy outside) and served on a wooden board to keep it from getting soggy. Perfect balance of seafood and veggies to batter. Service was pretty attentive throughout even though most tables were full. Though it did take a while to get our first dish, the food was piping hot and fresh.
5 stars to reflect satisfaction with food quality, friendly efficient service, variety of dishes on the menu, ambience and value. Everything was delicious and I'll come back here."}
{"text":"YOU WILL ENJOY YOUR MEAL HERE. Trust me. 

WHY? Because the food is amazing, duh. ALSO, the service is exceptional. AND DID I MENTION that the food is incredible? OH, I DID... well there's no harm in saying it again. 

THE FOOD IS REALLY TASTY GUYS. 

The most important thing though, is that everything about the experience feels like it was made with love. The meals, the music, the chairs, the cutlery... it was all made to make you feel good about yourself and encourage you to be your best. 

NO, SERIOUSLY. You will leave this restaurant a better person. And at the end of the day, isn't self-improvement what life is all about?"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Korean food and I was over the moon when this restaurant opened up. They are still in process of setting up, getting their alcohol licence, but their food is great. No, I'm serious, the food is delicious. I recommend their Sundubu - soft tofu and seafood spicy stew/soup, it's one of my many favorites. The service was good, although they only offer 1 small kimchi dish as banchan, unlike other places where you get at least 3 small dishes to try while you wait for your food to be prepared. That being said, I like the place and will definitely be back there again."}
{"text":"I am Korean and let me tell you. This resto is the BEST KOREAN RESTO experience I've had in Montreal. I've tried all famous Korean restos in the city \"Omma to gandara to kantapia to all NDG places\" 

The food here is just lovely and tasty. I've ordered some stews, fried stuff and bulgogi (beef). They were all great. You can tell that they use very fresh ingredient. Staffs are so friendly.  
The price is super for the food (I am actually doubting how they would maintain their business since the food is really cheap for plateau area). 

I wish them the best! (because...I will be regular here! ) highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally a decent Korean place on Mont Royal! Sure it was not crowded but it was a Tuesday night and it's newly open. The deco is chic which I didn't expect. Service was very good too. Tteobokki were ok, dolsot bibimbap was really good. I would come back again even though the ambiance was a bit stiff. I guess it just needs more time to get known."}
