{"text":"Great service and food. The Hibachi dishes were delicious. Chicken fried rice was good not great. The shrimp tempura was horrible but the dragon roll was great.  The chicken egg rolls were delicious. Our family will definitely will return. Additionally, besides the horrible roll not having vegetable egg roll or spring roll is disappointing."}
{"text":"I took a chance on this place because it had good reviews . I must say it could had been better . It's not terrible but the rice isn't good has no taste to it at all . I got the hibachi steak with the first rice and veggies . My mother had gotten the chicken and honestly just reminds me of mall food"}
{"text":"Eight dollars for a Styrofoam container full of dog food!  by far the worst \"hibachi\" I've ever had in my life, hibachi at Heinen's grocery stores is better than this and I never went back to buy that again ether. The steak is thin and overcooked the teriyaki is thin and sour! I don't know why, the vegetables yet Crisp we're not plentiful more burnt onions than anything. I did not get the fried rice wanted to judge the hibachi with white rice."}
{"text":"Great food! I ordered out and my food was amazing. I got teriyaki chicken and a California roll and they were both very delicious. I will definitely be ordering from here again. The prices are a little high, but my food was great and the portions were very large! Definitely recommend what I got."}
{"text":"New business and I was feeling the rumblings of hunger so I set foot inside. Brand spanking new inside not like some of the other places we've all been to where they most certainly show their age!  Weird thing?  No Asians to be found, NORMALLY a spot akin to this has the whole Asian family employed to which I find weirdly comforting, I really do like when the Matriarch is at the counter barking out instructions in Cantonese and everyone else is in a flurry of activity.. Not here... Weird... But still... Food came out in a timely fashion and pricepoint spot on! Got to my car and couldn't wait so I tore in, ginormous helping I tell you!!!  Only thing was the lack of flavour, I got spicy chicken over noodles but got rice. But the rice was very good! Just that the chicken didn't have any flavour so when I got home and dug into my zesty spice arsenal and most certainly kicked it up a bit! So in a nut, if your on Denison and getting the grumbellys give Teriyaki Express a shot!"}
{"text":"Place is very clean and the food is delicious. The owner really cares about this place and makes sure every order is to perfection. I would highly recommend this place it's not your average hibachi to go. #Quality"}
{"text":"I got the Teriyaki Chicken with half noodles and half white rice and it was delicious. Very big portion for $7. Will be returning again."}
