{"text":"This store is absolutely amazing. I loved all the jewelry and hone decor. We ate at the restaurant and the pizza was so delicious. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Le magasin général du Vieux-Montréal a de quoi charmer avec la fière allure vieillotte que lui prodigue une architecture pierreuse et briquetée, datant de 1873. L'endroit idéal pour y vendre des produits contemporains, je suppose... On y trouve un peu de tout. Ce sont pour la plupart des objets modernes qui sont supposés venir agrémenter le chez-soi, des objets du quotidien que tout le monde connaît, tantôt excentriques, tantôt classiques, à la limite du chic stéréotypé. Meubles, verrerie, jetées, accessoires de cuisine, vaisselle, ustensiles, réveille-matin, horloges, chandeliers, poufs, vases, sculptures, etc... La mode féminine se joint également à la partie : un grand comptoir à bijoux dispendieux mais quand même originaux et des sacoches, dont certaines émaillent un peu trop de fioritures tape-à-l'il.  Parmi ce tout, il est bien à noter que quelques objets se démarquent. Un appareil photo rétro en carton assemblable? Ou encore des paquets de cartes neufs, mais à l'allure surannée? En tout cas, je ne m'attendais surtout pas à y trouver là des diabolos, ou encore une machine à coudre merveilleusement ornementée, brillante de par sa survivance.  Le deuxième compartiment de la boutique est essentiellement réservé à l'exposition d'uvres picturales. Les toiles varient hebdomadairement."}
{"text":"This shop is on the waterfront in Old Montreal and I stopped in to get something for my hubby since it was his birthday. Whimsically decorated mugs and teapots,  clocks,  jewelry, scarfs, dishes, sundry items, bags, very large selections. He wasn't interested in anything in the store, but I bought a lovely pashmina for myself.  He, being the great guy that he is, told me to get one in all the colors.  I restrained my self and only got one. I would have taken a teapot set, it was so colorful, but realized that our one bedroom apartment in New York City was already chock full. C'est la vie!"}
{"text":"It's pretty adorable. The gift shop/cafe are connected, so though we didn't go into the cafe, we could still hear the piano (which was terrific). They sell adorable little gifts and jewelry, if I'm not mistaken. Definitely worth a look if you're nearby!"}
{"text":"Cute place with live music (piano) and good food. The restaurant is attached to a gift shop. The decorations and the vibe of the restaurant were amazing! We took our time eating brunch there and enjoyed the live music. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast restaurant in the area, but the one we were thinking of only opened on weekends.  So, we wandered into this store/ cafe.  This is a delightful little place where I thought at first was an antique/ gift shop, but it also had a cafe that served us omelette, yogurt parfait and lattes.  Ambience is pleasant and relaxing with light classical music playing in the background with people drinking lattes and eating croissant reading newspapers. There's a lot of gift items to browse in the store after eating or while waiting for your food.  The omelette was not an American style omelette, but more like a souffle that's baked in a ramekin, but it tasted good.  I enjoyed their ambience more than the food it self.  It felt like being in old Montreal.  With antique and knickknacks around I enjoyed the experience of being in this place."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite spot in Vieux-Montreal. Definitely worth a visit!   We stumbled upon this place as we explored the old city for the first time. I was won over instantly. On one side there is a boutique store with home decor and accessories. On the other side, a very inviting cafe. Amazing ambience, incredibly skilled pianist (apparently lunches only), cozy and rustic decor, and an excellent selection of drinks and food. We had the brie fondant with peppers and nuts, which was really good! And the mulled wine and a kir. Both very good but ended up being a bit pricey (2 drinks and an app for 40$) - I guess for the location you have to expect the mark up.   I love this place. Going to make it a regular stop whenever I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"A little bit of everything French for the tourist who doesn't want a moose sweatshirt to remember their trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the shop and 4 stars for the cafe - but since it's listed under shops I gave it 5.  This is the cutest shop I've seen in a while. They had a wide variety of cool jewelry at very attractive prices - mostly around $20 and the 'high end' stuff was in the $50-$100 range. Also a good supply of kitschy housewares and scarf/shawl kinds of things.  The cafe is a mixed bag - bad-ish service with OK food (a sausage/rabe pizza) and tasty drinks would normally add up to 3 stars. But the location on the waterfront, the live piano music, and the free wi-fi bring give it that extra star. One pleasant touch was that the piano player segued lightly from song to song so there was never that awkward silence when the cafe patrons don't know if they are supposed to clap."}
{"text":"The feel of Old Montréal, unique items in the store, and the you pass to the eating area. A menu of different ideas for lunches, or a little snack while sight seeing. The decor brings the resto to life. Loved the experience, always a stop when I am in town."}
{"text":"A couple of days ago we were wandering around the Vieux Port and went into this store.  The first objects to attract my eye were a couple of stunning art glass pieces, curved rectangular forms on stands.  They were different from one another and both were beautiful.  The store has a range of merchandise, from colorful and functional ceramic pieces to art glass to interesting clocks to junky jewelry to assorted candies in large glass jars.  Truly a general store.  We saw a clock that interested us and yesterday, when we moved to the ship Alan walked over to the store and bought it.  When we reach the US we'll find a UPS store and ship it home.  The clock was sent in a great fabric handle bag and a piece of chocolate was thrown in for good mean.  Trés cool."}
{"text":"The review is for the gift shop not the cafe.  It's cute & has a few fun dresser knobs,kitschy jewellery,signs & such. Staff was friendly & not pushy. Just did a quick walk through. Cafe attached to it seemed ok."}
{"text":"What a great little place! The store is filled with cute unique things that are one of a kind and the cafe is very nice with great food. Me and my friend had butternut squash soup which was amazing and Mac and cheese which was great. It was the perfect snow day lunch! A must go"}
