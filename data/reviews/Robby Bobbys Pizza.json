{"text":"Totally worth the price. Better tgan Little Cesar s and cheaper! !"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend go here when we are lazy and don't want to cook! They have great wings and pizza...I think the restuarant is pretty nifty looking and they just opened a bar which I want to totally check out! I read the other reviews and I think the staff is nice but that is my opinion! But u aren't there for them but for their great food delicious! Plus its a good price!"}
{"text":"Been looking for an inexpensive sit down pizza restaurant. Happened upon Robby Bobby's. Pizza was very, very good! Ordered the margerita and the meathead. Prices are reasonable and service was outstanding! The place was clean and quiet. They offer a $3.99 large pizza when picked up. Definitely will stop by again."}
{"text":"They definitely need to work on their customer service. We came here Friday night & awkwardly stood there for about 3min before someone said can I help you. (Note there was about 5 employees present) We proceeded to place our order w/ a hispanic chubby girl who obviously had a stick up her ass. Then we got our Pizza & wings & she had the nerve to say \"have a good night.\" Uhhh...we were eating in. We had to ask for our own plates. No one ever asked if we were doing okay, even though we needed forks for our boneless wings. We ate a bit & were super annoyed so we left. The pizza was nothing to rave about. I'd compare it to Little Cesars but more greasy & thinner. Their boneless wings were blah. I will not be coming back or  recommending this place to anyone.  FYI: I'd recommended Big Boys Pizza for awesome pizza & great customer service."}
{"text":"Don't know whats up with Robby Bobby's. Tried to place an order on line and it said we would have to order in advance because the restaurant was closed.. Tried calling them 3 times and no answer. Not even a voice mail explaining why they were closed. Was very disappointed. Was going to try their pizza this time. I like the cheese steaks, best I have found since moving from the east coast to the valley. They just need to cook the onions and green peppers more. Wings are good. Can't say I have enjoyed their frys at all. Even the special order ones(carne asada  ect.) too dry and they get real nasty once they get cold. and to little toppings, way to little hardly any at all I wonder if they have closed shop for awhile because of the light rail construction. Would be nice if they left a message explaining this."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Mesa, however, because of work, I'm there often. I was racing back toward Phoenix/Scottsdale where I could get some late lunch when I saw a young girl holding a sign which read \"Large Pizza $3.99. I stopped in, thinking \"what do I have to lose\", expecting the worst, and hoping for something just edible. I really was blown away by the pizza, the place is super clean and nice (not what I expected for those prices).  I consider myself a pizza snob, having traveled as much as I have, lived in Southern Italy where the pizza is REALLY good.  I now find myself eating at Robby Bobby's 4 or 5 times per week, so far I've had their burgers, subs, and lasagna, no complaints here.  These guys keep surprising me. Yesterday I saw something there that I NEVER expected, Greek fries. Are you kidding me? They had Greek fries, I was in Greece 2 months ago. I ordered some, they were awesome!!  I understand this place just recently opened, and I sincerely wish you guys at Robby Bobby's the best. You guys have a good thing going, good food, nice people, and a really nice looking establishment, probably the nicest, and cleanest restaurant in the area.  Keep up the good work, and i wish you all the best.  Good Luck!!!"}
{"text":"Not wanting to go out, but wanting something new I decided to give this place a chance and ordered a meal delivery. The food arrived on the short side of the delivery envelope they gave, and the delivery guy was friendly.   But.. The food was mediocre. I ordered the Colossal burger (Medium Rare), some Greek Fries, and some boneless chicken wings. The burger was well done, and the wings were a bit dried. I wasn't a fan of greek fries, but I wouldn't hold that against them because I'd never tried them before and I suspect it's more of a \"me\" thing than them.   I probably wont be ordering again from them, but I would wave someone off if they were headed that way."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to checking them out. We went to their website, looked at their menu, decided what we wanted to order......  Then we got told not a single one of the 3 items we tried to order were on the menu anymore.  We were then told that their menu online was old and outdated.    Sadly they lost my business tonight."}
{"text":"Another trip down to the valley and another taste of Robby Bobby's! But wait, something's changed...OH YEAH! They now have a FULL BAR and Monday/Thursday karaoke. Great drink specials too! Pretty sure we closed the place down!"}
{"text":"Hate to give a bad review but I also hate to spend money on food that immediately goes into the garbage can. I ordered the food for delivery. When I asked the man on the other line taking my order what the difference between the regular fries and the Greek fries was he replied \"The Greek fries have greek stuff on them\".   I wasn't sure if he meant gyro meat or cucumber yogurt. It was neither. When the food arrived it was an hour and a half later ( I was told 45 min max ).   The chicken on the sandwich was fried although the menu said it was grilled and the bun was burned so badly! The fries were cold and soggy and topped with what looked like a white cheese and oregano. I honestly have to say that it was the worst. There is not one good thing I could say about my experience with any of it."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  We split a Greek Salad and ordered a pizza.  It was half pesto, half Alfredo sauce with feta & gyro meet.  Great crust - light and just Delicious and affordable.  Total bill was &16.00.  Glad to have visited & going to lunch there today!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review and \"Chuck A.\" (who is infatuated with aliens) and also claims to not work there yet all his photos are of Robby slobby bobby pizza has been harrasing me since. The place is low class and obviously all 5 star reviews are from relatives. I bet if they took ebt they would make it but I have a feeling they will go under this year. pm me if you want a screen shot of his harrasment emailed to you.  :o)  oh, here's chucky!  http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=b70f80QHL4KJNOeg8s0Q2g"}
{"text":"I never got as far as placing an order from them. I felt as though I was in that Monty Python cheese shop sketch, after the first three things I order the guy on the phone tells me they don't make anymore. He proceeds to tell me that I was ordering from the \"old old\" menu, which is funny because it's the menu on their website I went to 5 minutes before calling. I let him go do whatever else he had to do after that before I started to ask:  Stilton? Emmenthal? Gruyere? Any Norwegian Jarlsberg, per chance?  Advice: please update your website!"}
{"text":"This joint's pizza tastes EXACTLY like Pizza Hut pan pizzas.    I ordered it and gave my wife the leftovers.  When I asked her where she thought it was from she said Pizza Hut and didn't believe me when I told her it wasn't.  Greasy as hell, but a decent cheap pie.  The suicide wings are a joke, not hot at all.  Maybe they mixed up my order and gave me the mild.  Wings tasted ok, not great."}
{"text":"Colassal burger, zorba's pizza, and the gyro.... All AMAZING!!! I want to try other stuff but I know these are Amazing!"}
{"text":"Had this pizza again and it was only so-so this time. The consistency of the food's quality may be an issue here, but the delivery was timely and the service was still excellent, so I'd rate this place as average."}
{"text":"I moved to phoenix from southern cali in 94 and since have been looking for a good pastrami burger! I'm glad I have finally found it in Robby Bobby's \"Colossal\" burger. This is what mesa has always been missing. A pizza / burger / sandwich / chili dog place that delivers!!! Thank you Robby Bobby's I'll continue to be a weekly customer!!"}
