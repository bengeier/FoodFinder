{"text":"Just discovered this little place tucked away in Liberty Village, and it's become my favorite coffee shop in Liberty Village amongst the myriad of coffee spots.

It's organic, super cute and they have cool different lattes that aren't overly sweet like Toasted Marshmellow and Toasted Almond Mocha.  They also have an apple cider latte that allegedly tastes like apple pie, although I haven't tried it yet.

Service is super friendly and cheerful.  Me likey!"}
{"text":"UMA Cafe is tucked away on Fraser. Without signage on Liberty St, you wouldn't know it was there. I wanted to try UMA (after having tried School, The Roastery, and Druxy's). 

Service: Pleasant though a touch scatterbrained. Had to ask for a coffee card instead of being offered. Gave me the wrong muffin.

Coffee: Ordered the latte. It was good. Smooth and frothy. Well-balanced.

Food: Baked goods are supplied by a local bakery. There were 2 regular muffins on offer - Apple Crumble and Lemon Cranberry. UMA also offers gluten-free muffins but they were ridiculously tiny. Ordered the apple crumble muffin which I was quite excited for. But when I sat at my office and opened up the bag, it wasn't apple crumble in it but lemon cranberry. SIGH. Hence the 2 star review. Muffin was okay (but I don't like lemon-flavoured baked goods). It was dense but the size was generous.

Overall: Spent over $7 on this breakfast. Coffee's good. Service nice but flighty. Food's okay. Will I come back? Doubtful."}
{"text":"This is a coffeeshop that you can definitely miss.  It's on fraser and the whole size of the place is about the size of a 1 car garage.  I believe there's parking in the back as well as parking on the street, but walking is definitely the key here.

UMA has a neat thing where they brew a different coffee every day.  While I can't really say which coffees they have I thought this was pretty cool.  They're also stocked with your basic espresso bar to make all your espresso creations.

They have a small selection of treats like cookies, bars and scones, but by the time I went they were on the end of their daily life.  They're probably better fresh in the morning.  They don't bake any of their goods on site, they're ordered from a different place.

Lunch is an option here, as they have heated sandwiches that they offer.  I'm not sure about heating here as there are probably about 4-5 tables, so bring it back with you wherever you are.  Or eat outside, there's a tiny little patio table that you enjoy."}
