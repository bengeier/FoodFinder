{"text":"I have to start by saying that I love their goldieritas. And I love that they are across the street from me... Which is why I want to love their food. The first 10 or so times I went, the food was great. But the last 3-5 times, the food left much to be desired. The quesadilla had no cheese, only chicken. The chili is not even similar to a real chili. And the focaccias are not as tasty as they used to be... Where's the filling in the focaccia?! I used to love bringing friends there, but now I am too embarrassed about the food. My last friend date just pushed her food around and said that it was \"interesting.\" This is a great spot, but stop dropping the ball, Goldie's!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday for a mid-afternoon meal. It happened to be during the beginning of football season. This is a sports bar so I expect TV noise/cheering/etc. But, the TV sound was turned up incredibly loud on all the speakers in the place. It was uncomfortable and irritating. I took out my smartphone and downloaded an app that told me the sound level was over 100 decibels. I checked a reference and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health recommends that the exposure to sound levels of 100 decibels or over be limited to less than 15 min/day to prevent noise induced hearing loss. We spoke to the manager on duty who showed little interest in this. There were families with small children in the place and I can't help thinking their hearing was at risk. Food and service pretty good and I guess I could have just left and not expose myself to the sound level. Anyway, heads up if you're thinking of going there on a Sunday...."}
{"text":"We came here to watch the NCAA game and the food was complete crap. The veggie focaccia was supposed to have marinated cucumber which I think was marinated in water... Completely tasteless and the whole thing was tasteless...


If you guys wanna come, stick to the beer cause the kitchen is a joke ..."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. The calzone was great and the fries are delicious. I would definitely recommend this place for a casual dining spot."}
{"text":"One of the best neighborhood sports bars I have ever been to...great food and wonderful happy hour prices......plenty of TV's and a family environment .....friendly service too...."}
{"text":"Yoo this place is fire let me tell you the food is amazing the Monaco focaccia is the best thing there and the service is ok but the food man it's so good it's so jolly makes me in a better mood after and the fries are good and on an nfl Sunday the food is better and stuff. Just eat there it's good shit"}
{"text":"Excellent place to get a bite, drink or watch the game. Friendly folks. Tons of TVs, very relaxing."}
{"text":"Open and spacious. Service was good. I had an artichoke and chicken noodle soup. It was tasty. The prices are rather high for the small
Portions."}
{"text":"Not long ago I gave this bar 5 stars. I always enjoyed the staff, food and atmosphere  After meeting the new assistant manager yesterday afternoon, who is Rude to customers,this neighbor gem is a one star.  In addition to the asinine assistant manager., Two weeks ago, we waited over one hour for our food.  Bye bye Goldie's. Left your place and went to the much more hospitable lying & Louie's. You're not the only bar on town!"}
{"text":"Always good.  Staff is great.  Very fast when you are just having a quick lunch.  Staff goes out of there way to make sure you are comfortable.   Great for business meetings to overly loud for a bar"}
{"text":"What a great sports bar. Lots of TVs, great atmosphere, and great food. Try the telluride burger, wings, or foccocia. For dessert the cookie platter is the best."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Goldies (and Zipps) for their cheap beers, low-key atmospheres, and decent food.  We always go upstairs as we don't have to wait for a table and that's where the pool tables, shuffleboard, darts and buck-hunter are.  I go there a lot with a group of friends that just enjoys hanging out without feeling like we have to get crazy...although sometimes we do anyway.  

One word of caution:  The last two times I've been there my wings (medium buffalo) have come out with pink in the middle.  Both times the server immediately took them back and brought me a new plate of wings on-the-house.  The second plate was always cooked all the way through."}
{"text":"I'm adding this \"average\" review to the bevy of average reviews on this establishment. Basically it boils down to this:  if we are really hungry and in the area, we stop in. It's satisfactory, but nothing more, and sometimes less than that.

When my father was in town visiting, we happened to be in the neighborhood around dinner time so we stopped in. He had some sort of thing that looked like a wrap but was called a \"foccaccia\" that he said was \"decent,\" and it had chicken and veggies in it. Not very exciting I guess. My husband had the ribs; he says that they were less than \"ok,\" cooked to death with sauce slapped on them at the end.

I had a bleu cheese burger that was pretty good; it was thick and juicy and I liked the homemade chips that came along with it.

We had a cute waitress that was pretty attentive, refilling our drinks in a timely fashion and checking in on us in a friendly manner on and off throughout our visit. 

The rating of 3 stars, \"A-Ok\" fits this place perfectly."}
{"text":"Worst 15 minutes in this spot. I understand not taking reservations and showing up with a party of 8 would be a little hassle but the manager made it hell! I am of Hispanic decent and he did he not allow two tables too be placed together when I clearly noticed two white/American parties be able to have their parties accommodated. I am also diabetic and with it being my birthday a friend went out her way to bake me a few diabetic friendly cupcakes, which the manager explain do to them not being store bought they wouldn't be able to place in fridge. I understand of that is a rule and respect that but then he said if we left them in sight he would have to toss them. One after another I felt unwelcomed, racially discriminated as I and my Asian boyfriend tried to celebrate a simple birthday. I recommend people to take themselves to Zipps as they were beyond the accommodating with zero issues! Never will I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Goldies has always been a staple for sand volleyball players from Scottsdale Ranch Park to go to after games.  I am not sure what has happened but for the last few month, the service and attitudes of the servers and managers has been flat out awful.  After rude and incompetent service in back to back nights, I think we are heading to Versus Sports Grill from here on out"}
{"text":"Goldie's is a fantastic sports bar with delicious food & friendly wait staff. The crispy Golden Medium Wings & Hot Sicilian Focaccia are both absolutely phenomenal. This place is a must-try.

The only reason it's not a 5 star review is they recently raised their prices by a larger margin than most restaurants ($1.50~ for most items on the menu). It's understandable with raising food prices, but it makes it a tough choice to go as often as before. Make sure you at least try this place once though, it's great!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. SUPER disappointed they RAISED PRICES. 

That is a HUGE increase in this market. Sorry guys, we live in the neighborhood but now you are too expensive to visit as often as we were."}
{"text":"Great service and the Toasted Blue Cheese Chips are a great appetizer. Lots of salads, pastas and burgers to choose from. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good burger,  good portions, good price. Shared burger for $1.50 and got an extra side. Telluride was good-- can't wait to try others. Both chips and fries were good."}
{"text":"Sarah was awesome! I asked her for some recommendations and went with the buffalo chicken pizza and she suggested trying their pan cookie for dessert.

Great atmosphere with a plethora of televisions and all the sports!"}
{"text":"Been going to Goldie's since I was In high school and still love it many years later.  The  Focaccia's are better here than anywhere else. Also the the cookie desert and have been getting it for years."}
{"text":"Now I know why the place was dead!

After leaving Scottsdale 3-years ago, one of my favorite bars has fallen apart.  Here with my wife for the weekend, I said \"let's go to Goldie's.\"  My bad. I'd comment on the food but we didn't bother to stay that long thanks to Derek; the manager.  What a HORRIBLE attitude!  Again...  THAT'S why you were dead!!!

To begin, we were told by the hostess, the table we wanted (to watch the game we came for) was meant for a bigger crowd and we may have to share. We figured the more the merrier!  Derek....   comes over to let us know we are going to have to relocate if a party of more than 2 shows up.  Next, my wife wanted to try their very hottest sauce (since I told her how good I remember them to be)....   Here comes Derek!   \"We custom make it so I can't, otherwise I am going to charge you.  That's our policy!\"  Hmmmm, interesting.  All the while my wife is sipping on her drink made incorrectly. My wife begrudgingly agreed and we began to order. \"Flappers only please.\"  Sorry, we don't do that here.   So, let's chat with Derek...  I tell him I'd like to give him our feedback.   All I hear is blah blah blah, that's our policy. We tell Derek we're disappointed and are going to leave. He proceeded to still bring me the check. Really???

Funny thing is, we would've been fine with everything had his delivery been different. In a city with so much competition, you may want to treat your paying customers better. Not to beat a dead horse but THAT'S WHY YOU'RE DEAD! Long story short if you don't want to read everything... Go to Zipps!"}
{"text":"I almost feel guilty writing this review while using their wifi...almost.

One star on this one. And that star is just for the food. 

The food is good, but when the brought out the wings and I had asked for blue cheese dressing, the gave me ranch with blue cheese sprinkles on top. This felt like a cheap parlor trick, and as I am not a fan of ranch, I was utterly disappointed. I asked the waitress of they had real blue cheese, and she said yes and offered to bring some out. When she did, it was the same kindergarden magic trick they had tired to pull before. I don't like being lied to, even on the smallest level.

Secondly, they don't accept Visa gift cards??? VISA gift cards are supposed to be accepted wherever Visa cards are accepted. Except this place evidently. The manager advised it was \"corporate policy\"

If you are looking for ok food, whilst getting screwed in the ass by small corporate greed, look no further than this place.

Or Buffalo Wild Wings is right down the street, and they won't cheat you out of your blue cheese."}
{"text":"My work placed a large to go order tonight and Goldie's did an amazing job making sure we all got everything we needed. Special thank you to Ellie for making everything and putting it together for us. You are a rockstar. The great food and attentive customer service (even for to go orders) is why my co-workers and I come back!"}
{"text":"A favorite for lingering lunches. They have a nice selection of wraps -- mostly chicken-based-- and regular sandwiches. Their fries and home-made chips are excellent. The staff is always pleasant and hard-working. Goldie's can be pretty busy lunch time, so you might want to avoid it if you are working a tight schedule."}
{"text":"Really nice sports bar. Went there when I was in Scottsdale to watch my Texans play. The food overall was outstanding! The wings were delicious, the pizza was wonderful, and the brownie skillet was rich and flavoring! And the overall atmosphere of the place was so great, it makes me want to make a sports bar like that! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Drinks are decent if ordered at the bar, otherwise prepare to have bad mix drinks at the tables. Food is \"so-so\". I wish they would come up with more new menu items. I mean seriously, I've been going here for over ten years and not much has changed. I'm sure your wondering then why do I keep going back??? WELL, first of all if you have kids and want a family friendly place this is a good spot. They have an arcade game room in the back which keeps the kids busy while mom and dad can talk and relax a bit. NOW, they could also improve there happy hour menu desperately! No good deals and the HH food is, well I'm sure you can guess what I think. For that I give it 4 stars but because the menu is outdated and is just \"so-so\" in general and the drinks are hit or miss (boo!) I give it a 2  stars :( Sorry Goldie's but you have to update the menu and poor some better drinks! And it would t hurt to do some remodel if the place too. I mean seriously, you make a ton of money and it never looks like it goes into the business to update the place in any way. Looking old and rundown. And last but not least, please tell your bar tenders that if they break a beer glass over the ice chest please let them know that they can NOT continue to serve ice in people's drink for obvious reasons. It needs to be completely emptied and made sure there is no traces of glass shards left in it! I witnessed this and I was appalled!"}
{"text":"Where to begin.. oh I know, at the part where we ask our server why it's taking so long for quac and chips to come out? It had only been what, 30 minutes?? It's pre-made! Comes out finally and the chips are so stale you can't even chew them, and the quac was warm and nasty in a little tiny salsa bowl, this is your quac? We let a different waitress know that our chips were bad and ask to speak to a manager (at this point it's clear our food was never put in) now around 40 minutes or so I flat out tell the manager there is no way things should be taking this long (dinner salad, a couple of kids meals that were supposed to come out first) that clearly our order must have been forgotten. He says they got hit with a huge crowd at once and it was just taking time....but not to worry he would bring free desert (which came out burned by the way and took 20 minutes to get- we shouldn't have even bothered but the kids heard so we were forced to stay). Two minutes after new chips arrive (still stale by the way) our entrees and salads come out together and the kids burger is a burger cut in half- it was burnt and had cheese on it so it had to be redone. No one came around to fill drinks- our server was horrible, no one cleaned the table before desert- not even after making huge piles of the plates stacked together...7 people's plates worth! Three kids and 4 adults. It wasn't even crowded! And then we had to wait for the crappy desert! The skillet brownie that couldn't even be eaten because you couldn't scrape it off- thanks for that one, made my already upset kids who were overtired from the almost 2 hour dinner even more pleasant (insert eye roll here) so of course I have to promise them real dessert tomorrow. Never going back! And that's really just half of it because I can't give this place anymore of my time."}
{"text":"I have good and bad experiences with this place. Anytime I dine in the food is fresh and great but the past 3 times I've had take out the fries specifically taste old! I specifically tell them to make it fresh because I've had a bad experience where the fries tasted old and they still didn't bother to make it fresh. But I do admit that the food that I have tried is very good I've had there jalapeño burger and Monaco foccascia. The jalapeño burger was delicious, descent size and the sweet jalapeño sauce is very tasty I believe it's the same sauce used as a dipping sauce for the Monaco foccascia but with more heat. The service was great and they had really friendly staff.  This place is good but I wouldn't recommend getting fries or the chips when ordering takeout."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Terrible management. Terrible time. I'd rather get food from AJ's next door, and cook that at home versus ever coming back here."}
{"text":"Once again i have to say Goldies hit a homer with their giant perfectly charbroiled hambergers. And Monday through Friday Kendra will take fabulous care of you and your appetite making this totally cool sports bar and restaurant the perfect place to have a great time, great food, and great personalized service. BTW the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch with a friend. Nice variety in their large menu. I had the chicken fochachia and a side salad. Friend had a huge Caesar Salad. We both enjoyed the meal. Need to come back and check out dinner. Service was great by Kendra"}
{"text":"Terrible food and terrible service! Every time I've been to Goldie's (I only go because others in my party want to go), the service has been awful and tonight was the absolute worst! The server never delivered one of our meals and when asked where it was, he gave attitude and said he told us it would be out in a minute. Needless to say...20 minutes later, still no meal. And to top that off, once the server delivered our meals to begin with, he never came back to check on us and we were in need of drinks and salad dressing and he avoided us the entire time. The manager then came out and delivered the chicken fingers meal 20 minutes later and we told him we wanted it in a to go box since everyone was done eating at the point. He then disappeared for another 10-15 minutes then finally brought out the to go box. The management is an absolute joke and could care less and did absolutely nothing about it. I will never go back to Goldie's again and I will be sure to share my experience with everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Dirty Smelly Nasty! I've been served moldy bread here twice when I ordered a Chicken focaccia, I informed our server and she didn't ask if I wanted something else or anything. The wings are good however so if you do end having to eat here, order the wings and nothing else. The place is old and has not been kept up. I can tell the owners don't give a hoot.  The last time I had to go there because it's the only place in my neighborhood that's open late and my friend was starving, I had the wings and they were good. 
Now to the beer, we each ordered a beer, I have been drinking beer for a very long time. After one sip I said to my friend, she happens to be a bartender, this does not taste good. I can tell the tap lines have not been cleaned in a very very long time. Sure enough we both woke up with a soar throat the next day from the bacteria in the dirty tap lines. Order bottled beer only if you go here! 
 My recommendation is to find a place that is clean where the owners treat the employees like they matter so they might actually care."}
{"text":"Goldie's is a great place. we have been going to Goldie's since they opened. we love Jimmy. The cooks could be more consistent. Discovered a bartender named Ellie! Wow she is awesome. Not really sure why there was another bartender working; because Ellie was doing all the work. anyway we will be back back to see Ellie. Ellie is our new favorite. She is a real asset!! 

 ."}
{"text":"Been going here for 23 years... Never clean... Last night was the worst filth I've ever experienced and may never return. If the bathrooms and eating area is that bad... What's going on in the kitchen?"}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon cheeseburger with egg and crispy fries.  My meal arrived almost 10 mins after the meals of my companions (one of which had actually just gotten up to go check on my meal).  First bite was a French Fry which was clearly old, soft, and dry.  Next was egg which was was over hard then bit into the burger was well done.  These strikes so I just couldn't move on.  

Called over the server and advised her of the issues.  I reordered a cold sandwich with chips.  

Took almost 12 minutes to arrive but while waiting the Assistant Manager Joe came over to inform my about their eggs.  He did this by crouching down next to me to tell me all our eggs are cooked hard, just in case you order it again.  My response was \"I won't\".

No apology for the bad food, inconvenience, or my experience just an PSA on egg cookery!"}
{"text":"Great food great customer services.  Pancetta Salad is delish!
But if you want to creat a new addiction you've got to try the GOLDEN WINGS. I always get the mild. They are the BOMB!"}
{"text":"Goldie's has been a part of my life since as far back as I can remember! It is a central Scottsdale institution that is great for families, teams, teenagers, college students, and even the most sophisticated food lover. They have other locations under the name \"Zipps,\" but nothing compares to the friendly, local atmosphere at Goldie's. 

Their golden wings will make you forget anything you ever learned about manners. They're sweet, spicy, and unlike any honey-hot wings you'll ever try. The chicken focaccias (pronounced \"fa-cosh-yas,\" as stated on the menu) are without question their most popular and delicious menu item. It is impossible to describe them- trust me, I've tried! Just try one for yourself, okay?!

The only reason I give Goldie's a 4/5 stars is the inconsistent service. My server last night was awesome- as is most of the current staff- but I've had some sub-par experiences in the past. The food more than makes up for it, though. It is absolutely worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I like Goldies and we take out often because the food is usually good but, honestly, they cannot get orders correct. Every single take out order is wrong. either they forget something or they undercook something, like wings that are called in to be well done. And when they make a mistake, they do not take responsibilty for it. They charge for everything including ranch dressing which I feel is insulting. Again the food is good but, under these circumstances, we will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"For bar food, this place has some of the best in town.  You cannnnot beat their fajitas!  Fabulous!  (We always get some buffalo sauce on the side for extra kick!).  Their wings are also awesome!  Great food, friendly atmosphere...we've been coming for 9 years and counting..."}
{"text":"I love Goldies! Its like the \"Cheers\" of Scottsdale, but everybody doesn't know my name there yet.  Gotta try the Goldaritas. Great place for happy hour, and to watch a game. Can get crowded, hard to find a seat at the bar. 

Tip- pretty decent buffalo wings"}
{"text":"Ashley P is such a great waitress! She always is on top of things! The wings, one drink and 2 salads cost  $14!!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Recently started dropping in at Goldie's once or twice a week. It's Cheers, but in Scottsdale, which is great. They have drink specials every night and the bartenders there are always extra attentive -- I really like Ellie, she's fantastic. 

Haven't eaten much there yet, but all the food I've had so far has been great. The root beer float is delish, I'm looking forward to trying their shrimp -- you get half a pound for $9.

If you live in Scottsdale, but don't want a cozy place that isn't overly formal or extra pricey, this is it!"}
{"text":"Great focccia and golden wings. Been coming here for years and can't wait to move back to AZ and this be my regular spot for Sunday football again"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the staff is always friendly and the location is great! For a great neighborhood bar I recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Just moved to Scottsdale and found this place for happy hour. Great find with lots of happy hour specials. It was really busy Wednesday night filled with super friendly 30,40,50-somethings having a great time. Happy hour menu is awesome."}
{"text":"We started coming here in June this year even though we have lived here for 5-years.  We should have made this our go-to-place for Happy Hour.  If you have a group of quiet friends or you just want to move a bit away from the gang downstairs - go upstairs!  It's for adults only, has high tables, and a few games if you need them.  The wait staff - both downstairs and upstairs - doesn't get any better than here!  They are very fun to interact with and attentive.

The Happy Hour food and drinks are great.  We found Goldie's to be most friendly and wanting of our business.  It's nice to be treated that way as customers.  Good friends, good food, and a great time.  Did I mention the food?  Very tasty and served how you ask for it the first time!"}
{"text":"Normally I don't go to places like Goldies for lunch.  But I met friends there and didn't have much of vote on where to eat.   I requested a Honey Balsamic salad with chicken which came to $10.80.  I got a big bowl of fresh spinach and basically a pinch of a few items with a very small piece of sliced grilled chicken.  Spinach is very inexpensive so they were pretty generous with that but that's where it ended.  The spinach covered up what I wouldn't be getting much of.   The other items were so sparse it was easy to count what was missing.  (5 ) candied pecans, a few small globs of goat cheese and I swear maybe a dozen dried cranberries if even that.  On the side was (1) tiny corn muffin.  The chicken was bland and the salad was so disappointing.  I normally love this type of salad elsewhere but boy did they cheap out on this one.  Sorry guys but $10.80 is just too much for a big bowl of spinach.  I could have built myself a more filling salad at AJ's and probably paid less."}
{"text":"Love Goldie's we always have a wonderful time and great service. They have great weekday deals and their Goldieritas can't be beat! Wouldn't go anywhere else to get my sports fix and great food."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop in for a weekday lunch, which I often do.  I'd say their food is a few steps above that of Zipps', their sister restaurant.  Their menu has many more options as well.  Good beer selection, friendly service, nice sports bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went there mid week Tuesday or a Wednesday last week.  Over 10 min to get greeted by our server. I noticed others sitting around waiting for checks, some with empty drinks. Slowest service I've ever had here and been coming here for over 15 years. Kids baseball teams inside with mobs of kids continually running by our table   Used restroom, full of screaming kids. Mention this to two servers and nothing is done or said to parents. Food comes out before too long but seems to have gone downhill. Everything had an old grease taste to it like maybe it hadn't been changed in a long time. Be awhile before the family comes back again. Voting with our dollar. Need to train these servers in service not just be a body on a schedule or your going to be calling bar rescue soon!"}
{"text":"Here from Oregon looking for a place to watch Peyton Manning surpass Brett in throwing TDs and decided on Goldie's. The service was amazing. Ashley was the best, but I noticed great team work from everyone. The food surpassed the average bar food. The wings were fabulous. The drinks were in 12 oz glasses and delicious. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best sports bars in the valley. Ton's of screens (although some of the big screen projectors could be updated). Nice big drafts and the food is always tasty. Try the teriyaki chicken sandwich with fries it's awesome. Upstairs they have shuffleboard and pool tables. Golden tee 2009 downstairs with another pool table. If you like loud sports bars where the patrons get into the game this is the spot to go. Plenty of fun to be had. People say too many kids but I guess I go later on at night and never have seen a problem with little kids.?. The service is on and off here, sometimes it's been great sometimes it's been useless."}
{"text":"Goldie's is A-Ok! 

If you like sports, beer, tasty bar but unhealthy bar food, you must pay a visit to this location. The ownership and menu is the same of Zipp's, so if you frequent those locations then you know what you are getting here.

I recommend grabbing one of the Foccacia's. They are all amazing and come with an amazing dipping sauce. Also, the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad is fantastic. Get it with some jalapenos on the side, and you will have one hell of a meal.

For a side, grab the sweet potato chips. Holy shiznit, these are amazing. 

There are TONS of TV's here, so you are all set for Football season.

I was here for a work event once, and the service was a bit spotty. Beware when it gets busy.

Otherwise, if you happen to be up in this random stretch of Scottsdale, Goldie's is worth the visit. If you live near a Zipps....go there instead. It's not worth driving here."}
{"text":"Don't bother~!! The wings are Grade 3, tiny and no carrots.. Way over priced Dive Bar~!!! Go to Taverne Grill down the street~!! Or anywhere else. . ."}
{"text":"Came here one Saturday evening for some food and drink. So this is like the more well-endowed, prettier sister of Zipp's. A lot of the same menu items as at regular Zipp's locations but they also have a lot more stuff like Filet Mignon, Baby Back Ribs, Fajitas, Meatloaf, Salmon, Broasted Chicken Dinner, Calzones, Pasta, Specialty Pizzas. Also, on tap they have more offerings - one of them being Summer Shandy which I'm partial to. There's even an upstairs although on the night I was there it was closed off for a private party. There's a game room in back. One thing that I didn't see here that most Zipp's have was the TouchTunes jukebox. Really nice quality TV screens all over the place. I'd probably be here much more often if I lived in this area but I will probably be here again someday. The service was pretty good the night we were there even though the place was packed. I indulged in Summer Shandys and also had the artichoke appetizer as the main meal as I wasn't very hungry. Good - sure - but you can't really mess something like this up, can you? Lotsa parking as it's in a big mall. Check it out especially if you're a big Zipp's fan."}
{"text":"Saratoga chips are good! Little slow on service... It was prime lunch time, but there were a lot of empty tables. Large selection on the menu, almost overwhelming."}
{"text":"The Good:  

-It is better than Zipps (owner of the chain- Goldie's is the original)
-The wings! 
-And the golden sauce
-The atmospere- very sporty, sports bar
-The patrons (usually very nice in that Cheers kind of way)
-Pool tables and shuffle board (upstairs)
-Upstairs (great view of the bigTVs on the wall)

The Bad: 

-9 times out of 10 the service is awful if you sit upstairs (and I prefer the set-up for watching games upstairs)
-Quite a few people bring their kids to this bar and I think it is even encouraged due to the arcade games in the back room (not a fan of bars with kids personally)
-I have ordered a variety of sandwiches quite a few times, sometimes very good, other times VERY dry and NOT good
-And I don't recall them having the greatest beer selection either


If you are in this neighborhood it is worth checking out if you want to catch a game."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food!Happy hour prices can't be beat. 

The focaccias are a must try item and will keep me coming back. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"I lived here 10 years ago and loved this place. Just came back and it's still the same. I would move back just for the Monaco Focaccia. I would buy this restaurant if it was going under. I would franchise this in all other 49 states. I love Goldie's. Do not ever change. Never please. 10 thousand stars for this place."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Goldie's merely because it was the only thing open in the strip mall.  It's a fairly standard sports bar, with tons of memorabilia on the walls.  It did strike me as odd that despite the fact there were several large TVs hanging around, none of them were on and showing a game.  The waitress even remarked that the place seemed dark because none of the TVs were on.  The second floor functions as sort of an adult play room with pool tables and darts and the like, which is nice because the waitress said there were usually a lot of kids there.

When we walked in the smell of garlic bread hit my nose and it was lovely.  For an appetizer we ordered the chicken roll, which came with a great sweet jalapeno sauce.  The chicken in the roll, however, tasted as if it had been boiled.  I decided to go with the angel hair pasta and shrimp.  The pasta is homemade and had a little icon next to it designating it as healthy.  It arrived in a soup bowl of oil.  This is not healthy.  Its actually really gross.  (Just close your eyes and imagine a bowl of oil.  Ick.)  The pasta was very very overcooked, to the point where it just congealed together in a mass. Homemade pasta is great but you have to know that you can't cook it as long as regular pasta.   It was nice that they peeled the shrimp for you, I enjoyed that part.  My husband had the ribs and thought they were good.  

I'm not sure we'll be back.  Perhaps for some drink specials during happy hour but the food didn't cut it."}
{"text":"Let me give you some bullets of tonight's visit:

*We asked for lemons twice in our water, but ultimately had to get them ourselves from the bar.

*We waited 1 hour for our food. The waitress told us that the kitchen got slammed, but a large table that came in after us got served before us. Clearly, she forgot to input our order and then lied.

*I ordered a burger medium-well, and it came out pretty much raw. When we showed it to the manager, his jaw nearly hit the floor. He could not believe that it was that pink in the middle.

*We were never offered drink refills

*Our table was never checked once we had food

Sorry, Goldies, but you have failed. 

I would say that if you are going here, just stick to beer."}
{"text":"Normally the food and portions are very generous. Love the pizza, pepper jack wrap, bbq burger, pretzels, wing salad but I do not recommend the kids burger. It was literally charcoal and only half a burger. They cut it in half. So strange. Its pricey for a kid but go with the regular burger. Fries are included and they are really tasty.

If you sit at the bar, Leslie will take great care of you."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for years. IMO The food is super low quality. Myself and others have ordered The chicken and it has come out under cooked at times, low quality and pink. Dangerous. My company, on more than one occasion, got under cooked, raw red burgers as well. We spotted IMO health violations on several visits. No gloves handling food etc...The place is DIRTY. Big time. 

The management staff, at best, is ignorant to client needs & demands. IMO They don't know a thing about customer service. I saw one manager trying to handle other customers that were upset and I couldn't watch. It was brutal. 2 complaints In a very short time. (1 hour visit) He brushed our food complaint off with nonsense. No offers for a solution. Just excuses. Instead of offering to make it right and recook the raw burgers. He blamed us for the order. 

My review is based solely on SERVICE,FOOD QUALITY & CLEANLINESS ALONE. These are my OPINIONS so dont yank this review like the last one. I own a private Personal Training facility in the Scottsdale Airpark and if we treated our clients this Bad we would have none. 

These are my factual observations. These are my opinions based on those observations. Please do not remove them this time. Ive given this facility many opportunities to make it right. They never come through for me or any of my associates."}
{"text":"I love you Goldie's! My long time trusted local sport bar. Love the happy hour menu, even the normal menu is great priced! Great burgers, fantastic focaccias and delicious wings, love the magaritas!!! If only they didn't limit 3 per customer during happy hour. :D The restaurant is very spacious and always busy but the service always is from decent to good! Big tv with a variety of sport channels. 

Cannot be happier to live near such a great place. Might be going there tonight ;)"}
{"text":"Great place been coming here for years.  Great, cozy location right in the middle of where I grew up.  Everything is good here!!!"}
{"text":"Only popped in for a few beers on a Sunday afternoon. Caught in-between the two Happy Hours, ended up with two $4.50 Blue Moons. Bartender was Leslie and she was very nice and upon wandering around the place was pretty impressed with the size and other nooks and crannies like the small upstairs patio and sneaky small first floor patio. Upstairs also had pool and lots of seating and no kiddies allowed up there. Had a bar seat and was watching some of the action in the kitchen during my hour visit. Food and menu appears similiar to another bar, so this must be part  of a chain. I remember the \"Foccaccia\" here is really a wrap made with pizza dough and has nothing to do with the real bread. French fries are said to be fresh cut, but there were fryers full of fries ready to dipped upon ordering - so not sure about that claim. Very big bar and a great place to watch sports as well."}
{"text":"I order from here almost 3 times a week for lunch. Always delicious, prepared correctly & super friendly."}
{"text":"Been going for 7 years now and have not found a comparable neighborhood sports bar.  Sure it may not have the best projector's and may have slow service sometimes but it has been the place to watch THE game for us since having moved out here.  Sure we lived close by for two years so I may be biased, but we have since moved to Fountain Hills and we still make the weekly trip down to get our fix.  Must haves:  Monaco Focaccia, Homemade chips (cooked \"soft\" pls, but NOT greasy) and a tall beverage of your choice.  Telluride Ranch salad for light grazers.  Dessert:  The one and only Cookie Skillet  Warning:  Zipps is nice and all but not the same and they don't do the homemade chips!  Downside:  Must get there early for a good seat, and sometimes they won't seat you until your whole party is present.  Also, they charge a buck for extra sides!  Seems petty, but it's annoying.  :(  

Other than that the CAFE is where it is at!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for nearly 20 years and tonight will most likely bey last. I stood in line and simply watched other people just cut us off in line and get seated before us. The hostess was kind enough to just look at slid and smile and just let them go. All I have to say is WOW. Same thing happened at sister restaurant- Zipps - lesson learned. I have to say the power of social media is a wonderful thing spreading the word. Thanks for the memories, going to make them else where now.

T gets better so I ask for no avocado and (bc I'm allergic) and the put it on my foccascia. Good going. Talk about sweetening the pot so to speak. 

Seriously thanks for a night of hives, almighty with a possible trip to the hospital.

Can't believe of all the places. It was my favorite place and I never had any issues until tonight. 

Seriously can it get any worse. I bet they make me pay for the meal I didn't even complete eat (I particularly isn't like going to the emergency room) but I am sure they will.

Believe it or not they charged me for the meal I couldn't even eat (unless I wanted a trip to the ER).

They did offer to comp me a desert though

WOW"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!  MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CARE!!  Went in for the first time and the service was a nightmare. Waited over 10 minutes at the bar for someone to approach me. When my beer was brought I was asked would you like a glass and I said yes and never got one. Then a couple who were clearly regulars, came in and within 30 seconds were greeted by name had their drinks in under a minute and had menus. Meanwhile, nobody asked me anything.  I had to request a menu. I asked for a glass of wine with my dinner which was never brought so I had to flag somebody down to get it for me.  Everybody else was given condiments I was given nothing. I felt like I was an outsider at some high school clque.

Afterwards I asked to speak to the manager , Kevin who clearly had no interest in what I was saying , was looking right through me, and couldn't have cared less. I told him about the slow service not getting what I asked for and all he had to say was the food does take a while and I said I didn't mention anything about that.  He said the next time you come in ask for me and your drink is on me.  No apologies at all!  Clearly, this guy is related to an owner or something. I think they had to wake him up from a nap or something.

The best part was as he walked to the end of the bar my server followed right along with him as she was clearly signaled and they sat there and talked and talked while I waited to request my check. I left a 25% gratuity told the server please throw my leftovers in the trash walked out and will never return.

The food here is  no different than TGI Fridays and if you are not someone whose been going there for years and years forget about any decent service. Very evident this place only stays in business because it's a sports bar in an area that doesn't really have any.  Speaking with the Manager, Kevin, was a lost cause. Food wasn't that great and from what I saw From didn't look that great.  Avoid any frustration and stay away from this Dump that doesn't know how to Provide decent service and is clearly relying on their TV sets. Can't say how awful this experience was.  Go elsewhere to watch games If you are not a regular. The game will be over before you get your first drink. Awful awful place."}
{"text":"It's definitely my hood's \"sports cafe\" (family members of all ages are welcome).  I come here on a weekly basis -- mostly to sit at the bar and mainly to satisfy my cravings for their wings. Yep - I ain't afraid of no fried chickin'. As a matter of fact, I'm no stranger to all things fried. \"Eat'em up YUM!\"  Their bleu cheese chips, buffalo chicken foccacia and tenderloin sandwich are also good. I don't venture too far from my main staples. I did try their ribs and chicken combo once and it was pretty good but I'm not fond of their pizzas. Stick to the bar food and you'll be just dandy. If you're a smoker, there's the back patio area with picnic tables and a TV screen or step out doors if you're upstairs. You'll find families with kids and grandparents hanging out around meal time, which is comforting, but also of which is why I mainly sit at the bar (hehehe - no offense please). My all time reason for coming here for the weekly wings? It's like taking my lil scooter around the block and tahdah, I'm there!"}
{"text":"Have been going to Goldie's for years.  Their wings are delicious and their pizza/calzone are worth trying. Plus, they have a few pinball machines which add to the overall visit 

Will continuing visiting Goldie's for as long as they're around."}
{"text":"Great food; great service; every time !  It is especially a fun place for Super Bowl.  Have been going there for years and even for Super Bowl - the service is top notch!"}
{"text":"Goldie's is a real American Institution... you can also find the same great food at Zipps Sports Grill. The Monaco Focaccia is the best thing on the menu, you will be sorry if you don't order it. It's compiled of Chicken Breast, melted mozzarella cheese & ranch dressing served with a side of Sweet Jalapeno for dipping. The best thing about this place is the Sweet Jalapeno dressing that comes on the side... my friend Eric Henning will drink the stuff if it's in front of him (it's that good). 
Another must have is the Golden Wings - I like them Medium. I will just come out and say they are the best wings in town, nay, the best wings I've ever had. They are just delectable. If you go during Happy Hour you can get a cheap 32 oz. beer (or 2) to wash it all down."}
{"text":"Favorite neighborhood spot!! This place has the best foccaccias.  They are legendary in Scottsdale. Great place to watch games as they are covered wall to wall with televisions.  Great happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"I'm fed up with this place. I have been coming with my parents for more than 15 years or so. The service is hit and miss. Tonight was no exception. It was not busy at all and we didn't get menus for almost 10 minutes after we sat down. Two workers were talking at the hostess station for the longest time. Then they both walked away before we finally got menus. My dad and I nearly walked out and we should of. The food was fine. But the attitudes of the workers can go. Two servers waited on my dad and I. Really. I felt like the first one didn't want to wait on us because of the shirts on a non Arizona sports team we were wearing. The manager (I think it was) was a total prick. He brought something to our table that we didn't order and he goes \"I guess I can't count.\" They tried to take our plates before we were done and could not wait to give us our tab. They were lucky they got a tip."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for awhile. Decided to watch a game on big screen. Didn't enjoy the game but screen available wherever we looked. Nachos were good. Cheap wine good. Server attentive."}
{"text":"Big fan of their HH beer and the Telluride burger. The staff are (mostly) courteous and attentive - there have been one or two kids that could use a little help, but, hey, we all start somewhere right?

Overall, this is a good sports bar to come relax and watch your favorite teams play."}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere for a local sports bar and grill. Service is polite and friendly. Food is decent."}
{"text":"I grew up going to Goldie's and it truly is the neighborhood bar. My boyfriend loves the wings and I love the blue cheese chips. 
If you are a vegetarian DO NOT GET THE PASTA! It is made and then thrown into a bowl with chicken broth. It doesn't tell you that on the menu.
Other than that, overall it is a great place to watch the game."}
{"text":"I went to Goldie's and I said, \"Let there be Hot Sicilian Focaccia\" and there was Hot Sicilian Focaccia. I saw that the Hot Sicilian Focaccia was good, and ate it."}
{"text":"Eh ... 

I'm struggling to find something I liked about this place and the only reason I'm not ripping it to shreds is bc I love their sister restaurant, Zipps. I'm trying to give them a chance. 

I frequented Goldies on a Thurs during lunch and had terrible service. Our server was very nice but was clearly lying out her teeth every time she spoke. That was evident from the get-go. It was embarrassing. She didnt like the way my lemon looked in my water, and while I appreciate that and I appreciate her getting me a new one, I do not appreciate her doing it while at the table with her bare hands. She did tell me that she had just washed her hands, which she hadn't. I saw her in the bus station and I saw her roaming around the restaurant while waiting for our drinks. Ugh.

They don't have any lunch specials. Who doesnt have lunch specials? Food was SUPER late. It took more than 30 min to get our lunch and we had to ask about it. We were told by the server that they had to make sure our order was correct & that took some time. Really? We ordered a standard burger but wanted beef rather than turkey. Not too complicated. And if that is, you shouldnt be in business. 

Manager never visited until after we got our food. He did offer up some coupons for next time to my friend. My order really wasn't that good but I dared not say anything bc I didnt have time to wait for a replacement. I would be dead by the time the new entree got to my table. 

Very disappointed. I know I won't be back ... I'll stick with Zipp's."}
{"text":"Great specials, lots of TV's and fantastic atmosphere. Definitely recommend. Sunday's are fantastic to watch the game. Have great game day specials and even better food!!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times with friends and have always had a nice time!

The food is good and the beer is cold!  They have enough HDTVs that you could even catch a game on Mars.  

They have all your favorites: Pizza, Chili, Buffalo Wings, Loaded Nachos, Spicy Chicken Quesadilla, Pasta, BBQ Baby Back ribs, all in the $8-9.00 range. My favorite is the Loaded Nachos which are delicious!  They also have hot and cold sandwiches, salads, burgers and a bunch of the usual sides.

Goldie's is just a great neighborhood sports bar, without all the distractions and so-so food found at a Tilted Kilt or Twin Peaks.  It's a place where you can bring the family and not feel embarrassed by the servers or your fellow customers.  

It's Three Stars \"A-OK\", bordering on Four Stars.  As fellow Yelper Nydia A said: \" Its like the \"Cheers\" of Scottsdale\".  I would agree!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love coming in on the nights Ellie works.  She gives the best services,  talks to you and remembers everything about you and always has a smile on her face.  The food is great,  I haven't had anything I don't like yet."}
{"text":"Great Service and good with a warm family welcome and family friendly. Great selection of beer and mixed drinks. My fav is the goldierita's. But the corona is Great as well. The golden wings are great. Especially the cookie skillet which is cooked in the wooden oven!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting this Goldie's for the past 15 years and I always love the food. I'm a fan of the chicken tenders, or the burgers, and definitely the pizza cookie. But service is usually pretty slow. If you aren't in a rush, This is a great place to hang out, order appetizers, and watch the game(s). I say games because there are a plethora of tvs  no Matthew which direction you look. There's also a patio which is definitely quieter if you are interested in the food but not so interested in the noise. I'd say Goldie's is a classic that's always worth a visit."}
{"text":"So, Goldie's is the \"sister bar\" to Zipps.  Personally, I prefer Zipps over Goldie's, but it is nice to go somewhere a little different sometimes.  We usually head straight upstairs where they have 2 pool tables, Big Buck Hunter, Golden Tee and a dart board.  We went here last night for our Buddy's birthday celebration.  He and his wife live right down the road, so it's super convenient for them.  The big difference to me between Goldie's and Zipps is the quality of food and sometimes the service.  We had an order of wings and they were still pink inside and I ordered a Monaco Foccacia, which was really dry.  However, the Goldie-rita was really good.  It was strawberry.  Super delicious.  Another issue is that there is only one server upstairs and there must have been at least 75 people at one time up there.  It's not really her fault for that, but at the same time, she wasn't that nice or personable to us when we got there.  After everything died down and there were just about 20 or so people, she was showing the guys how to do push-ups (the guys were betting eachother earlier on how many pushups each of them could do).  That was kinda cool."}
{"text":"Always Friendly and food is always on pizzoint.. great dinner place for families.. ill be back soon"}
{"text":"The focaccias are great and Kendra is great. Our go place for after kid's games or to watch U of A."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Service is kind of spotty and you'll probably have to wait/flag down your waiter/tress. The chicken strips are amazing and so are the deserts."}
{"text":"Such a great place to go as a family! The food is delish and the kids love going because of the food and the game room. We love to go because of the food and the game room :-). We can actually have a nice dinner and the kids are entertained. The staff is great and you'll likely run into a friend at this neighborhood family favorite."}
{"text":"Spent the entire day there for Sunday Funday football games. There was good and bad. First the service we had was exceptional. Our server was attentive, gave refills, kept up with our many orders, and kept all the checks separate for about 5 different sets of people. We stayed so long because of her service. There were some hits and misses as for the food. Beer cheese pretzel appetizer was terrific and we ended up having 4 or 5 of them between our large group. The soup was alright-nothing special and the grilled cheese was a triple decker (way too big with the mozzarella and cheddar on the sandwich. Fries were good.  Great beer choices and the television screens were perfect for watching with a large group. The bathroom floor (upstairs) was so sticky that it was gross.  We all had a great time, and the server really made a difference. She wasn't flirty at all-she just paid close attention to us all.  Based on the service, I would return and our group said the same"}
{"text":"Food took an hour and half to get our food and it wasn't correct. Took alone 30 minutes just to put our order in, finally a manger got involved and assisted us but it was disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Great family spot or for hanging out with buds.   Shoot pool.  Watch sports etc.  nice staff and good atmosphere.   It's your basic neighborhood pub that you know for years."}
{"text":"Best sports bar anywhere. Friendly staff good food reasonable prices. It's like the Cheers bar of TV fame! Go there often! And never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Goldie's for the last 10 years since little league baseball. They are a big supporter of the community. You have to try the Monaco focaccia, the blue cheese chips, the buffalo wings, and the burgers! Oh and of course the cookie skillet!"}
{"text":"We only came because everything else was closed and we needed dinner. Last year it was PACKED, this year it was not at all. The food was not very good. The pizza tasted like Red Baron or something of that sort. The server was not very good. She only came to get our order and our check. Someone else brought everything else to us and was much more helpful and kind. The drinks were good. I would come back and try something else because it seems like it could be a cool place. I can see how it would be a fun place for sports games or big groups."}
{"text":"The food wasn't very good. Had the meatloaf. Suppose to be homemade. It was cold and had a funny taste. Unlike any meatloaf I've ever had I my 65 years. Broasted chicken was breaded. It. Was ok but it shouldn't be breaded. Our waitress was young and in a hurry. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Goldie's is a typical sports bar, great atmosphere, decent T.V. placement and good food. Their burgers are amazing! ( I personally have the 1000 Island Burger with Avocado/Bacon/Mushrooms), The burgers are big and juicy and filling. 

I  completely agree with Brian, the first few times that i went during peak hours the place was riddled with children, it reminded me of the Wal-Mart's that you find in south phoenix. Too many kids for a sports bar, but i just couldn't stay away from the burgers. I recommend going there for a late evening meal or  during off peak times to avoid getting kicked/punched in the head by the children."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times but only because of proximity. This place is always packed but think its more due to the fact that there really isn't any competition in the area.  It's related to the Zipps chain so the menu is similar.  Wings and burgers are decent but the prices are a little high for a sports bar.

Don't really like the setup or the screens as watching a game is a little awkward and can leave you with a neck sprain.  Despite a number of different screens the quality of the screens are surprisingly bad.  They need to send someone up on the roof to adjust the antenna or update the technology.

This place always gets high marks from the local paper but I just don't see it."}
{"text":"I guess there no real polite way around this review:

I will never go to Goldie's again.

The night started off normal. My mother, sister, and I sat at a table and within five minutes or drink and appetizer orders were taken. The drinks were brought first and our dinner order was taken.

The server argued with me over what I ordered because the menu didn't really appeal to me. Nothing seemed appetizing. I didn't really mind her giving me guff because that's what servers do in a sports bar: bust the chops of the dudes. Honestly, I was fine with it.

After that: crickets. We didn't see our server for 45 minutes. We didn't even get our food. I got up to find a manager. After talking to him, apparently a party of 40 showed up, and it required the attention of every server in the house. There was zero communication from any server to their tables as we weren't the only ones who were left without a server.

She finally showed up to our table. Didn't apologize. Didn't acknowledge the party. I mentioned the wait, and she immediately copped an attitude about how the 40 people showed up. I was stunned and didn't retort.

The manager came back to our table, and I told him about the attitude and how she never communicated the party to us. I told him that she kept telling us that she's been working there for two years. I figure if you're working at an establishment or in the same line of work for more than a year, you should have some basic communication skills down.

After the bill came, nothing was comped. Again, restaurant 101: comp at least a round of drinks or an appetizer to try and subdue the already irate customer. He did give us $10 in \"GoldieBucks,\" but it was already too late for me. I'll never go back to that place. To make up for it, I didn't leave a tip.

My sister lives in the apartments right behind there so I'm sure she'll be back, but she said she learned that you need to sit at the bar if you want any service..

Food: 1/5 Service: 0/5"}
{"text":"\"Shit food\" is not a swear Mr. Manager
menu said item was marinated and sautéed but it was just raw veggies wrapped in a pita...the manager disagreed and said it was sautéed and marinated...
The food is tasteless..."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a cold beer and to watch a little college football on a Saturday.  This place did not disappoint.  Beer was super cold and multiple games were showing.  The chicken wings were fantastic and would definitely order again.  Probably will not get the ribs again, a little dry and not very meaty.  Homemade chips were a nice bonus!  Will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Golden wings are amazing! Also try the black n blue burger. The Asian salad was a good healthier option. Really you can't go wrong and proportions are really big, enough for the next day's lunch. Lots of TVs, excellent for sports games!"}
{"text":"I went to Goldie's today to grab a quick lunch with my friend. Goldie's is a place I've been coming to for years with friends and family alike, and is sort of my neighborhood sports bar. 

As usual I ordered the old time favorite \"Monaco Foccacia\" with the homemade chips. Goldie's provides an abundance of wonderful condiments, including the Sweet Jalapeno sauce that goes perfectly with the Monaco. I am also usually a fan of their ranch sauce which is never watered down, and was a winner once again today. All of this only cost me under $15 for a satisfying meal which is always delicious.

While Goldie's does have an extensive menu, I would recommend sticking to the classics such as the Monaco Foccacia, Golden Wings, Bleu Cheese Chips, and Chicken Tenders. 

Great bar food, and a good place to watch a game with all of the televisions. Service can be slow at times which would be one of my only complaints, but today it was great."}
{"text":"Maybe this place would be better if we ate there however based on our Togo food it's hard to want to give that a try. We ordered wings Togo and asked for extra sauce, we had ordered them before and they were so dry so we figured we should plan ahead. Imagine our surprise when we opened the box and they were bone dry yet again. They are wings!! We didn't order them naked we ordered med wings. Maybe that's how they do things here. So if you want bone dry wings this is the place for that!! So sad because it's so convenient for us to order from here. But I like sauce on my wings so will make the drive elsewhere. Decided to give it 2 stars instead of one only because the dry wings were still meaty. Pics don't do it justice!!"}
{"text":"I'm really not a fan of this place. The food is so-so, the fries are god awful and the happy hour prices are barely even discounted. Best thing about this joint is that 32oz beer when it's on happy hour"}
{"text":"For a sports bar, Goldies by far has the best food in town!  The faccocia sandwiches are to die for.  I've tried them all and love them!  I had read the reviews prior to going and mentioned to the server about some of the negative items such as not enough dips, etc.  She was so friendly and our sandwiches were covered in sauce and she brought us different flavored dipping sauces to try.  The prices for what you get, especially in Scottsdale are great!  There are TV's in every direction and they even changed the channel for the tv nearest us.  I would recommend this place and would like to eat there at least once a week!!  There are a lot of children or families, but they are only allowed in certain areas."}
{"text":"I have been going to Goldies for years. Best wings in town.  I have pretty much had everything on their menu and its all good! I dont know where they find their waitresses or who hires them but they are all so cute and friendly. Lots of TVs with sports going all the time. So good food, friendly, good looking staff and sports...what more could you want?  Can be a bit long sometimes getting food from the kitchen so a lunch hour isnt enough."}
{"text":"We had a party of 9 tonight and 2 of our meals never even showed up to our table and we waited for over an hour for them. I was lied to by at least 3 servers that my food was on it's way but only when another person in our party went and found the manager did anyone start to try to do something but at this point everyone was already done eating so we refused the food.  

Then 1 person in our party ordered food to go and we have been sitting here waiting for it for almost 45 minutes since it was ordered.  

Now the waiter says it's not coming out for at least 15 minutes so we cancelled it.  Unbelievable.  

We asked to speak to the manager again and when I asked who his boss was he claimed to be the general manager and he was a complete asshole and only offered to give us a 1 round of drinks for free.  

What a joke.  We are never coming back to this place.  

The 1st time I came here was in 1997 and we were regulars but guess that's done."}
{"text":"Restaurant was dead, we waited over an hour for cold food. Overall a bad experience and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"2 bad experiences 1st was terrible service. I was served and I was almost done by the time my wife had asked for the sauce was brought over.  2nd most recent was kids running all over the benches and the table tops outside with and without shoes.  Do you think the employees wiped those tables down before customers sat there. Too  many different servers comming to the table to bring your order also the quality of the food in my opinion has gone down. Use to go there a lot and have noticed the staff change. No more patronizing Goldie's for us"}
{"text":"At first walk in, it's a cool looking bar/ restaurant. Very open, with high ceilings yet an older feel to it. So I liked it already. 

So I'm surprised by the reviews about servers. Ours was absolutely delightful. She was super helpful with offerings in the menu and was timely. She was also easily accessible if we did need anything. 

First, we ordered the nachos with all the fixings. Included cheese, black beans, chicken, shredded beef, and ground beef. They were ok. Probably wouldn't order again. 
For main dishes, we ordered the golden wings,  a cheesy burger, and half rack of ribs. All were good, no complaints. We left happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"Apparently the same people who own Zipps, own Goldie's as well. I went here with a date and we had burgers and beer (how can you go wrong?!) I liked the layout and was impressed it had 3 huge screens on one side and an upstairs with shuffle board and pool tables.  The food was good and portions were huge."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for a drink and bite to eat! The food is great and the beer is cheap!"}
{"text":"Yummy buffalo Bleu cheese chips. And the pizza cookie is yummilicious!!! 2 floors of fun atomosphere!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely crap food and the Manager was not helpful at all ... failing to exchange the uncooked food saying you already had part of your meal after we tasted it."}
{"text":"For a sports bar it was good. Expect good service and average high calorie bar food. Go with the intention of watching TV because it's unavoidable. Beer list isn't extraordinary, would recommend the blue cheese and buffalo chips."}
{"text":"Love the food and most of the severs and the bartenders are great! However, today we ordered a focaccia and asked for extra plate so we could share a meal, but according to their lame manager this afternoon, Goldies has a policy that prevents two people from sharing a meal, and If you do, they apply a split charge and bring out your split meal on separate plates, with another whole serving of fries which we don't want or need! WTF? My wife and I go everywhere and split a meal, why does Goldies have a policy to penalize people who don't want to overeat, and why do they want to promote obesity by charging people who only want to eat a reasonable amount of food? Horrible policy, horrible practice of penalizing people for trying to be healthy, and horrible management!  Eat elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I've had a love/hate with Goldies over the years. . . there have had a few issues that kept us away- for years at a time LOL- but I'm happy to say we're back in LOVE with Goldies and consider it our 'go to' spot for cold draft beer, good nightly specials and consistently friendly service!! Management is attentive, servers are AWESOME and we're happy to see that they're investing back into the restaurant, making improvements to keep it looking good.  Rumor has it they're even upgrading their TVs!! We're lucky to have an iconic place like this in our 'hood."}
{"text":"How about just plain yuck & gross. Unless u like burgers that are yes huge , but have ZERO taste. I'll take in & out any day. Seriously , this had to be one of the most disgusting dinners of my life. Everything was gross . Have no clue why anyone likes this place ??"}
{"text":"Best Foccacias!  I'm craving a Sicillian or Monaco Foccacia right know with their sweet jalapeno sauce...2 bad I'm on a 5 day no carb diet!"}
{"text":"Pool tables upstairs are great! And they have a bar upstairs too! The staff is great! Always happy and ready to serve! My fave!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Goldies since it opened. I basically grew up at this place as my family would eat there several times a week. To this day we still meet many times a year and are always treated to a delicious meal and great service. Their new menu is mazing and the beer cheese pretzels, wings, foccocias, and blue cheese chips are to die for. Keep rocking Goldies!"}
{"text":"This is a popular family dining spot.  Good drinks and video games to keep the kids busy. The food is good and the menu is pretty broad."}
{"text":"Chicken foccaccia is amazing. Best sports bar food anywhere. Never miss when I am in AZ."}
{"text":"Consistently good food...best wings...buffalo chips and then the oven fired Pizzas...always welcome and friendly service....just want to go back and back for more...."}
{"text":"Hmm, let's see.....a bar with walls full of large TV's, Beer, and good food....yes, I'll take it!  Goldie's is a fun neighborhood bar where you can enjoy watching a game with your friends or family.  During football season, this place can get packed....especially after work on Monday or Thursday nights.

Some food items we've had:

Babyback Ribs w/Fries, $18

Their Burgers are huge and delish.  My all time favorite is the Thousand Island Burger.  The Beef is fresh and full of flavor.

Overall, this place is a lot of fun.  It's one of our regular hang outs.

{"text":"This place used to be my go-to when I was in my 20s. Loved, LOVED this bar!! 

So here's a few things, when you're a sports bar in Scottsdale, make sure you're staffed for the Masters. I mean, cmon!! This place was packed on a Thursday afternoon with one waitress and one bartender. Bad scheduling for reals.

Their happy hour menu was okay. I ordered their wings, yummmers, and the spicy chicken focaccia. The real blue cheese in the dressing was awesome and the sweet jalapeño dipping sauce for the focaccia was AMAZING per usual. 

We went upstairs to play some bar games and didn't see a waitress for over an hour. Boo. Their Golden Tee game was not hooked up to the internet so we couldn't load our accounts. Boooooo. 

But other than that, the food was amazing and when we finally did get a waitress, she was amazing as well. Yay Goldie's!!"}
{"text":"The food is consistent and it's always fun to have a good neighborhood pick. I am grateful to have a family friendly sports bar down the street from us. It feels like a Scottsdale version of Cheers. :)"}
{"text":"If you are in Phoenix even for just 24 Hrs you have to try this place. The food is amazing - and by food I mean the Buffalo chips - they are outstanding."}
{"text":"By far the best sports bar in town. This neighborhood gem is what started the popular Zipps chain, so if you're a fan of Zipps you'll love goldies. The cheeseburgers, pizza (wood-fired unlike Zipps), focaccia, wings, and chicken skewers are all amazing. Sometimes you'll spot some AZ Cardinals and AZ Suns players in there, too!"}
{"text":"This place is huge and has a really good set up. Bar and tables downstairs. More tables, a small bar, pool, and shuffleboard upstairs. Decent service.

Their food however is awful. Their chicken fingers look like cheap fish and chips the way theyre battered, the turkey they use for their sandwiches is SUPER dry, and their pizza looks and tastes like a Tony's frozen pizza rip off. Just to give you some examples.

I totally recommend this place for drinking while watching whatever game fits your fancy, just decline the menu."}
{"text":"Goldie's has very good food. Can't say I ever had a bad meal. However, if you are looking for a beer and munchies, hands down they have the best nachos and wings. Great prices on beers during HH. Margaritas, wines are just okay."}
{"text":"Feeling welcomed is an understatement...as soon as we walked in, Ashely was a breath of fresh air!!! Love the arcade and having an upstairs that 21 and over to play pool, darts, and shuffle board...just an all around great experience amongst all the tv's with any type of sports you're into. Great sports bar and the food is fabulous. Thank you Ashley and Kevin for making this our new place!"}
{"text":"Just a great neighborhood sports bar with great food and better service. The bartenders know everybody. Great people."}
{"text":"I would like to tell everyone Goldie's is the best sports bar ,they have specials every night food and drink . Jim and Leslie and Elie are great they give great service  and make you laugh and feel right at home . Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"-Minus a star because they wouldn't accept my \"vertical\" ID because of state law (in the process of getting the replacement since other one is lost) even though I'll be 27 this month, they said they didn't doubt it was my ID or that it was me but still refused to serve me a beer, okay fine whatever. -Minus a star because our order took forrrrrrrever to get, it wasn't even busy/full of people so that was really annoying. We had two orders of wings & one of fajitas . -Minus a star because our waitress wasn't friendly seemed like she was in a bad mood, not great service at all, you get treated better at a McDonald's drive thru. My family & I have been in here a few times before & it seemed alright, however I highly doubt we'll be going back."}
{"text":"I had an issue with the split charge just as others have mentioned. I just requested an extra plate, I didn't want the meal split but she split the sandwich, gave us each a full portion of fries, and charged us a split fee. This establishment is promoting waste knowing ahead of time the food is going in the garbage. They would rather promote obesity and have you eat more food than you're hungry for or want to eat just to make more money. How ridiculous!! 

It doesn't cost them any more money to bring over an extra plate but they won't allow it, they instead bring extra unordered food and then charge you for it. Oh by the way they don't tell you there is a split fee that starts at $2.00, so check your bill when you get it. 

Read the lame response from management below and I suggest you eat elsewhere or order and when they deliver the extra unordered food, decline the order and refuse to eat or pay for it and walk out!


Dear Linda,

I wanted to get back to you regarding your complaint.
Splitting is a service that we provide for the minimum fee of $2 which provides each guest with a separate dish and a separate side dish. We do have our service staff and management enforce this if a couple is ordering just one item and plan on sharing it. We do not enforce it if more than one food item is ordered. We would be remiss if we didn't support our staff in this instance and that is what we are going to do. Split charges are very standard in this industry for many reasons.
 
There are certain items like our appetizers, desserts or pizza which are designed to share and we do not require the split charge. You mentioned that this came up when you ordered pizza, this was incorrect and we are sorry that this was handled improperly. We will be sure to re-address this policy with our staff.
 
We understand and appreciate that you and your husband have been dining at Goldie's for many years. We hope that you can understand and respect our policies and procedures when visiting us.

{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place. Never going back. They need to be more cautious of food safety and understand the importance of it. People can become very sick and sometimes die due to the mishandling and neglect to food safety."}
{"text":"Sorry, can't find anything good to say except cheap beer at happy hour. Went during happy hour so wings were cheap. Service was slow at the bar. My troupe and I tried a few different things. Nothing redeeming, Pizza was just plain bad. Wings were just not cooked well and the sauce was sub par Burger, eh.. I won't go back, unless I adopt fifteen children and want a place where they can go play while I get tanked and count my money. Cuz they have lots of TVs and some games for kids. Not my thing. I like Zipps better, sorry...."}
{"text":"It was the night of my best friend's birthday and her boyfriend had rented out the top room of Goldie's to get everyone together to celebrate.  When I got upstairs I was really impressed with the room!  It was HUGE!!  Lots of tables and chairs, there were pool tables, shuffleboard, arcade games, not to mention bathrooms and a bar just for the room as well.

Once my initial awe of the place wore off I realized that I was hungry so I started perusing the menu.  I decided that the Pepper Jack Focaccia looked yummy so once the waitress came around I put in my order.  Due to how delicious the description made it sound my level of hunger escalated quickly.  Unfortunately the speed of delivery of said meal was not what I had hoped for.  I realize that our waitress had a large group of people to serve but I also showed up a couple hours after everyone else so there may have been one or two other orders in, if that.  It's not like everyone was ordering something at the same time.

Once my food did arrive I was happy with it.  The focaccia dough was soft and not so thick that I felt like I was just eating bread.  The ingredients inside were good and had a decent flavor but there wasn't really anything that gave it that extra POW to excite me and make me crave it the next day.  Even the side of sweet jalapeno dressing that came with it was pretty average.  I know it starts with the word \"sweet\" but jalapeno is the second word and there was no heat!  I want to come back another time and just get a regular table, order something else, and get a true experience of the place but for now I just had an average experience here."}
{"text":"I am excited aobut the larger menu choices now.  I asked two employees when that happened and neither of them knew.  I am guessing very recent. My burger was very good.  Next time I will order it medium rare.  It was too well done for my taste.  I asked for hot fries and I got them.  My daughter was disappointed with the pretzels and beer cheese.  We told the waitperson that there was something wrong with the cheese.  Beer cheese is usually orange and very creamy.  It cost $7 too.  It was pretzel bites.  The cheese was whitish and watery and tasted like salad dressing.  Looked like ranch to me, without the garlic.  My daughter said it was awful.  When I tasted it, I knew something was wrong with it.  It was REALLY bad...tasteless and watery...no taste of cheese or beer whatsoever.  The waitress did not appear to believe me or offer to replace it...that was surprising.  She should have insisted on bringing another bowl or comping it.  I felt bad because my daughter ordered appetizers instead of a meal.  Happy to see appetizers and other sandwiches now on the menu.  Always associated Goldies with burgers, wings, and pizzas.  I will come back and try a sandwich."}
{"text":"We went here for the Notre DAme/Alabama game. Obviously it was packed to the rims. However the service was extremely attentive and courteous, which in super packed circumstances like that can often go by the wayside.  It's a sports bar, and it serves it's purpose."}
{"text":"My girlfriend lives just a few blocks away from this place.  We eat here maybe 3-5 times a month.  Always great service and the food is a top notch.  If you've been to Zipps, well it's the same thing because Goldie's was the first!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like Goldie's ! They have a lot of vegetarian options , not many vegan ones tho. And they expanded their menu recently adding tons more goodies on there. I love getting their blue cheese chips with ranch instead of blue cheese dressing. Also I'm into their focaccia , the black bean one with fries is amazing !"}
{"text":"Misconception 1: if my great grandmother were still alive and liked to throw back 32oz draughts, this would be her hangout. Misconception 2: a margarita the size of an iPhone won't do anything to me, even if the \"limit 3\" is some sort of warning. Holy crap! Yes, based upon original scanning of the bar demographics I thought I stumbled upon Shady Pines happy hour, but eventually the crowd evened out and hey - those seniors were slamming the drinks. Me, on the other hand, was struggling with the Goldie-ritas. I deemed them small, but mighty. Not even the buffalo chicken foccacia could soak up enough alcohol to keep me from feeling tipsy. As I headed to my next event I pondered \"how can I hang with the Golden Girls and be FUBARd by 5:30\"?!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food.!!! I'm so glad i live so close to this place. It's definitely a nice place to go out with friends and family, enjoy good food, good company, & watch the games on the big screens that they have. I would definitely recommend this place to try their food, it is so fresh and delicious. :) I can't wait to go back to this place asap.!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Goldie's for about 7-8 years now.
You won't really find a better sports bar in the Scottsdale area. 
For a sports bar, they make some quality food.  All is handmade and you can really tell.  They also have the best wings in the valley.
It's a great place to watch a game....but if you go on Sunday to watch a NFL game, get there early cause the place gets packed!
The service is fantastic as well"}
{"text":"Same owner as Zipps I'm pretty sure. Best. Wings. Ever. Beware, their hot sauce is really hot. I usually get them medium with a side of hot. And don't sleep on their cookie skillet! Great local hang out. Great to watch the games at too."}
{"text":"Still same horrible service but she has reddish black hair. I would have hoped management of this establishment would have made her attitude better or had to fire someone so morally incompetent. I will not even describe my experience but I will to a manager that responds, I expect to hear back."}
{"text":"Came during happy hour with some colleagues and ordered the buffalo and blue cheese chips, they were soooo good, kind of salty but I love salt, so didn't bother me too much.  Also ordered the wings they were really good, it came with celery and ranch, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I frequent here often...EXCELLENT service and good food! A must visit...especially if youre a sports fan!"}
{"text":"Ok here is the run down with Goldie's. I've been to this place a bunch of times, as I used to live right next door.

First with the good. The wings are probably the best wings I've ever had, and easily the best around. They have good happy hour and reverse happy hour. The place is filled with TV's for games, and shuffle board on the second level. 

Now the devastatingly bad. The management here is absolutely horrible. They must take lessons on how not to please the customer, because it's ridiculous. And it's not just a onetime experience, it's every time. They are basically ruthless towards customers. They have all these customer rules that they follow by the T. For instance, if you would like a bit extra dressing for your salad, they charge you. If you accidentally got ranch with your wings, and really wanted blue-cheese, they charge you. If you have a simple request, they deny you. It's 100% by the books here, and if you don't meet their criteria, then good luck. Some waitresses are friendly enough to help you out and swap things, such as ranch for the wings, but they don't last. If you've been there a few times you have probably noticed, that they ALWAYS have new waitresses and waiters, spare a few of their drones. You know why? Because they constantly fire employees that help customers out and disregard their little rule book. 

This bar actually has a drinking limit in effect, and trust me, they enforce it to the max. I think it's something along the lines of no more than three margaritas per person for the entire visit, and no more than two 32oz beers in an hour. They also won't serve a pitcher to a single drinker. 

All the food besides the wings is crap. At least the Burgers at Zipp's are good, but they're junk here. (Goldie's is owned by Zipp's)

I'd just like to reiterate how bad the service and management is here. If you are in the area and you want some wings and a few drinks, then give Goldie's a shot. However, other than that, stay clear."}
{"text":"If your visiting Scottsdale wanting to know where the locals go, this is the place!  Goldie's is that one place in town where everyone knows where it is and everyone has their favorite item (mines the Monaco Focaccia sub ranch)!  

When you walk in it does definitely have the sports bar atmosphere with tons and tons of TVs with every game on that you could think of!  However, if your not a sports guy don't let that scare you away, it's a very welcoming place for anybody.  

As I mentioned earlier, the foods awesome.  Everything is always tasty, even when I try something that sounds a little iffy, it's always great!

Service is what you would expect from a sports bar, the busier it is the slower it's going to be, but you should expect five star service here anyways.  

If your visiting Scottsdale or live here and have never been, I urge you to give it a try!

Return factor- 100%"}
{"text":"I love Goldie's! Great casual sports bar. Must haves are the Monaco Focaccia, the Grilled Artichoke, and Spinach and Mushroom pizza. 

Staff is always nice. They love there regulars here. Even if your not a regular you will get awesome service. Sunday mornings are always crazy in football season."}
{"text":"One thing I inherited from my mom is a love for bar food done well. Not frozen and fried Cisco stuff but actual food in a fun, sports-centered atmosphere. Throw in good service and a place like Goldie's is a heck of a winner.

We had just spent the morning and early afternoon discovering the natural bridge in Payson (natural hiker, I am not) and had worked up an appetite in a reaching-hangry-levels way. Boyfriend wanted a burger and we both wanted some place we could go in our workout gear. On a whim, we decided upon Goldie's. I'd been there once with old coworkers and remembered being impressed by my tasty veggie quesadilla. It's pretty close to home, so we were off.

We decided on guac and salsa to start with. Respectable offerings from a non-Mexican place. The guac home homemade and chunky, and was tasty enough, although some spice and lime juice would have helped. The salsa was refreshing and cilantro-y.

Boyfriend ordered his burger medium, and it actually came out slightly pink in the middle and still juicy--win! He said it was an amazing burger. His fries were definitely homemade. Skin-on potatoes seasoned and piled on. I, of course, stole many. 

I had to return to the quesadilla...it's random that it's so good here! The tortilla is flaky and almost buttery, the combination of unique filling (roasted peppers, onions, mushrooms, artichoke hearts) and not too gloppy cheese is fantastic. You also get personal ramekins of guac and salsa. Perfect!

The atmosphere is fun, with tons of TVs showing every possible game. Apparently there are arcade games in the back and the huge upstairs portion is adult-only. We are definitely adding this to our casual eatery list!"}
{"text":"We went to Goldie's to watch Monday Night Football.
I was impressed.  Great bar food.  Chicken Skewers w Goldie's sauce were fabulous.  Not heavily breaded and good chicken not the lower quality you find w most sports bars. 
Spencer was our waiter and he was so friendly and nice.  Very efficient & stayed on top of our drinks!  Which I like. 
We will go back."}
{"text":"A great meal at an unbelievable price --- here is a 'don't miss' restaurant spot in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"All food on the menu is great! Monaco Focaccia and Black & Blue Burger are yummy! Definitely the place to go to hang out with friends and watch sports. I highly recommend this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"If I could leave a negative star I would. 


I'm beyond disappointed this is my first time trying Goldies. My friend & I usually  go to zips (the sister restaurant) once a week but my friend recently moved so this was supposed to be our new designated meet up spot. 

After I sat down My first impression was on my goodness our server must be stoned because it it's taking her forever to do anything. I kid you not all the courses she served us came late. She was friendly enough aside from the horrible service. However She was very unprofessional she was talking badly about other customers to us. I finally get her to take our order then she Literally  runs away dramatically  from our table comes back with a big explanation as to why she had to disappear and evidently someone had gotten kicked out for abusing one of her regulars & then returned. TMI. Now I'm starting to think this place is really rough and really slow. 

After chasing our server around for another hour we finally get the check. My friend hands her a gift card.  The server says I am not able to take this and We ask to \"please speak to your manager because your sister restaurant takes gift cards all the time.\" She sends over Joseph Quintanar the assistant manager and he has a major attitude. He kept on repeating \"it's corporate policy.\" Finally we learned with that they have the ability to process gift cards on their computer system however they choose not to. So My friend said \"this is the only card I have on me.\" Then he says it well then someone at this table will have to pay for your bill. Imagine how uncomfortable that made me !!!!!!! 

We close out the tab & as professional as he is he goes around the corner and starts talking crap about us with the bartender. The second he sets the tab on our table he tells us we need to leave or he's going to call the cops. 

I see all the poor reviews on yelp about this assistant manager Joseph and I don't know how he still has a job. 

It's this shame he treated us this way because I would be willing to look past the slow & unprofessional service since I really enjoyed their food however I could not forgive his attitude."}
{"text":"Great $2.75 gin tonic happy hour.   If you like to get crunked this is  the place to go.   The bomb Golden chicken wings $5.   plus a great game room upstairs and huge big screen TVs to watch your fav team."}
{"text":"Until the non-smoking law goes into effect, Goldie's will remain chokingly smoke-filled.

I like Goldie's, minus the smoke, and it definitely lives up to its name.  It's a neighborhood bar to the T and it has two levels filled with TV's, games and of course, fully-stocked bars.

The drinks are fairly cheap, but if you come during happy hour, they're much more affordable.  The food is pretty good too- try the focaccia sandwich!

The service isn't that great unless you sit at the bar, so if there are open spots by the bartender, grab them!"}
{"text":"Really good food! Haven't found a place that offers broasted chicken in years! And there's is awesome! They must cook their homemade potato chips that way as well, because they are fabulous! I have found that I crave them a lot. This was our 3rd time there and the service we received was outstanding 2 out of 3 times. while they don't offer kilt lifter, our waitress recommended a beer that was comparable and we enjoyed it. Definitely recommend if you like loud sports bars and good food."}
{"text":"Goldie's used to be one of my favorites but today, despite what appeared to be a slow business day, our service was slow and with errors. Food was still great mind you, And maybe they just had an off day."}
{"text":"There was four in our party. We ordered burgers. Ashley was my server, had a major attitude. Someone in our party had an issue with their food and the manager Kevin came to the table. We were prepared for him to handle the little issue and move on with our already crappy meal and experience. He was a major asshole. I'm sorry I ever came to this place and wasted my time and money."}
{"text":"If I could give Goldie's less than zero stars I would.  We have eaten here many times - it's our local sports bar.  We've never had worse service - table of 8 and it took over an hour to get our meals.  Our waitress didn't check in for more drinks or come by to explain what was taking so long.  And \"manager\" Joe was useless - one person at our table ordered a hamburger and 30 minutes after we all finished our meals, he still hadn't gotten his meal.   The waitress argued with us about the food taking so long, actually trying to defend the kitchen because they were slammed.  It was Saturday night and a football game was one so why wouldn't they be prepared for a crowd"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the largest and coolest sports bars in town. The waitress said this is the \"mothership\" of the local Zipp's empire. There are a few differences - mainly the much larger menu and that they offer homemade potato chips with bbq dip that is out of this world. Don't miss the pool tables upstairs or the arcade in back. Happy hour is an event from what I hear."}
{"text":"One of the worst service experiences I've encountered. Do not sit upstairs if you want to get a drink within 30 min. Do not go downstairs to the bar and hope to get a drink any faster. Beer lists from upstairs and from the bar were not identical, causing confusion between patron and bartender, and waitress and bartender. I got a lot of attitude from the bartender when I asked for a beer on the outdated menu. To top it all off, the wings were incredibly dry. The waitress was very nice, but there needs to be at least 2 servers upstairs during happy hour."}
{"text":"Love this place. My son absolutely loves the golden wings. Best Margaritas in town.  Huge TV screens for watching sports. The food is typical bar food. It's the staff and friendly atmosphere that makes this place great. Truly a wonderful neighborhood bar and grill."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Scottsdale and my boyfriend, who has lived in the area before, recommended we go to Goldie's for a casual Friday night \"dinner and drinks\" date. For 7:30pm on a Friday night the place was kind of dead. The crowd was a weird mix of older groups and families with young kids. I guess I was expecting a younger crowd crowd, ie young business professionals enjoying a fun Friday extended happy hour. 

The service was good. Our server was pleasant, no complaints there. The food was surprisingly really great! I had the Tenderloin Focaccia with fries and my boyfriend had a calzone. The portions were HUGE so we both only ate half and boxed the rest. My focaccia was absolutely delicious. The calzone was also very good. 

After dinner we hung out at the bar for one more drink and again it was just...dead. Maybe it's good for a Sunday football game? Or maybe it's better on a Saturday night? The atmosphere was super disappointing and I'm not sure if we'll return. 

Food: 4.5 Stars
Atmosphere: 2 Stars
Overall: 3 Stars"}
{"text":"Great spot to just hang with the crew. Not the normal uppity Scottsdale bar. Games are upstairs and lots of room. Food was okay. I got the nachos and the chips were very stale but my friend got the burger and it looked really good. Good atmosphere. It's or after work hangout, if we can get everyone together more often.  :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Every time we come in we sit at the bar and get greeted instantly. I don't remember the guy's name (he gives it every time) but he is on point. 

Food is pretty good and quickly brought out! I would recommend anything on the menu in which I've never had a bad meal. Give this place a go and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tried Goldie's for the first time since they support our daughters high school.  They suck!  Sorry, but that was my first impression.  The place is outdated and in need of a remodel.  They had the air conditioning so cold we almost left.  The floor manager should catch that.  The pretzels were ok.  The wings were fatty and had very little sauce on them.  The pizza was ok.  Dominos is better.  The arcade stole $2 of our kids money.  At best, this place is a drinking hole.  I wouldn't eat there.  Established in 1993 and in need of a new owner that will bring it up to date, rework the menu, and for gods sake...  Put some good beer on draft.  The only \"one\" good beer on draft \" Alaskan Amber\" was not on happy hour.  Oh, and the happy hour pricing didn't make sense with respect to brand and sizes....  Weird!  With all of the great restaurants in Scottsdale, we won't be going back to Goldie's..."}
{"text":"I have always loved the food and drinks here! However, sometimes I find myself a little disappointed because some of the waitresses have not always been kind. When my younger siblings come here to eat they often do not get treated with respect because the waitresses assume they will not give good tips simply because they look like they are in high school. This is a terrible attitude to have. Why would being rude make them want to tip better? Goldie's is in a very nice area surrounded by a bunch of rich kids. It is ignorant to assume you won't get a nice tip right off the bat and ignore your customers. What would you expect after that?

On the bright side, if you look over the age of 21, the service is great, and with that, the overall experience is much better. There are a TON of tv's, so there is no way you will miss the game you're looking for! If you have never been there, I have 2 words for you: Monaco Focaccia. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One star experience. Only come here because it's close to my house and why I chose to is the 8th wonder of the world. Service is good, food takes way too long and is poor quality."}
{"text":"I have only been here a couple of times but I am definitely a fan.  We came up here to meet a friend that was in from out of town.  I love the honey wings and they had some great beers on tap.  We would come up more often if we lived closer.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend stopping in and grabbing some wings."}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers for a going away party. Casual, clean place. Happy hour prices are awesome. $5/6 for La Crema Pinot Noir? Yes please! The food is okay. Our server was fast and accurate. Don't know her name though. Oh, and just found out...if you charge the bill to your credit card, they will come up as GOLDMAN GROUP LLC. I had to look them up and was ready to call my bank for a fraudulent charge. Shrug."}
{"text":"I had forgotten how much I loved this place. 

Used to hang out here for happy hour a lot in the day, but moved offices and almost forgot it existed.  But how could I? Great, cheap drink specials. Yummy eats. And there's nothing better than taking over the top floor with friends to play pool or shuffle-board. And service is top-notch; there's always a member of the staff waiting patiently behind the upstairs bar, just watching for anyone who needs a refill.

Admittedly, I had to dock a star because the food isn't as high-quality as it used to be, but it still beats the typical bar food any day."}
{"text":"We had a great after-golf session if nachos and fajitas.  Shout out to Alexis, who was great."}
{"text":"Beware if you are a Trump supporter; don't wear a Trump hat or shirt  The staff here will single you out, give you bad service, and attack you.  Never returning this this place for sure."}
{"text":"Arrived at prime lunch time 11:54. First time here, not very busy. But it's Wednesday, and it looks more like a night life place anyway. Walked in and it's seat yourself, so I found a spot to sit down at and snap a couple pictures of the menu... I got awesome fast service right away. I have been to a couple zipps sports bars and i like burgers, so that's what I got here. Looks like its a sister to zipps or the same owners. They have 2 levels to the place, and it's very nice. Lots of games to play upstairs like darts, pool, shuffle board. Tv's everywhere. Place is a little loud though. Music blasting. Lots of room, and lots of seating. Looks like the from the reviews that you shouldn't come at night time, to busy and slammed that the food and service begins to turn to crap. Go at lunch! its really accommodating and way better. Food came out 10-15 minutes and hot. Burger was a little dry and lacked seasoning, but after I poured blue cheese and BBQ sauce all over it, it was good. Chips are excellent. I will come back for lunch, very chill place at lunch time. Friendly fast service."}
{"text":"I frequently get to go orders from this location because it is near my work.  The last time I went in my order was not right.  I called to let them know, and was told that they know who I am since I go in all the time, and not to worry, the next time I go in it would be free.  I went in to dine in today, and told the waitress what I was told, so she sent the General Manager over.  The GM told me that I have no way to prove what I am saying.  People lie all the time to get free food and he can't take the word of everyone. Basically called me a liar.  The cost of my item was LESS than $4.00, and he refused to honor what I was told.  WOW !  This is an example of how not to treat your customers."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and the wings are simply amazing :) I love how tender they are and someone told me when I was there that Zips owned Goldies and they both use the same wings and the wiings are really really tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Big fan of all the food on the  menu, and specials throughout the week.  Things that stick out in recent memory are the cookie skillet and the jalepeno burger, and fresh foccocia sandwiches. (they make their own foccocia bread, and it is delicious.)"}
{"text":"Usually very crowded but the bar staff is excellent and always friendly!  Good wings!"}
{"text":"Love Goldie's!  The food is yummy, great wings, and the home made chips are awesome.  It's kind of loud in there, so don't bring grandma, but other than that Goldie's is great."}
{"text":"Great food all around. The foccacia sandwiches are amazing and so are the golden wings. Lots of big salad choices and real entrees. They do nickel and dime you for anything extra but their ranch is so good, it's worth the extra nickels!"}
{"text":"I love Goldie's!  The Monaco focaccia and cheesy green chili chicken egg rolls are my favorite!  The chicken is cooked well, never dry or gristly. (I am super picky about chicken and get grossed out easily).  My husband talks about the golden medium wings constantly and we live in San Diego.  These are his ALL-TIME favorite wings.  I wish we lived closer!  We look forward to coming here every time we are in Scottsdale. 
The only reason I gave four stars is because the service can be pretty slow. But the wait staff is friendly and the food is worth the slower service."}
{"text":"Great great customer service. Attentive waitresses, busboys and management. Incredible margaritas. Food is positively terrible and mixed drinks taste like watery booze. If you're going for happy hour margs then go for it. Avoid dinner and anything besides margaritas."}
{"text":"I love Goldies! I wish there was more than one but I can get by with their sister restaurant Zips in a pinch. Great wings but their chicken focaccia sandwich is amazing. Make sure to get the chips instead of the fries..."}
{"text":"Reminiscent of sport bars east of the Rockies.   Happy we discovered this place. The food was really good bar food with a nicer selection than most. Nice selection of some craft and other beers too. Great place to spend an afternoon/evening when it is Phoenix cold or hot outside. The wait staff is great, on their toes and ready to please. Great tangy turkey chili that sounds boring but isn't and it's a meals worth with shredded turkey. A lot of televisions if you like sports. I am not a chicken tender connoisseur, but theirs are pretty light and amazing. Great place for a Superbowl game or to watch your favorite team. I enjoyed the warm every of the place."}
