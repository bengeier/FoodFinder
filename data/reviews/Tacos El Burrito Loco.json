{"text":"El Burrito Loco is your run of the mill on every other corner type burrito places typical in Los Angeles, but it is very good for that type of restaurant.    My food is always piping hot and fresher than I would expect for this type of joint.  Their green chile pork and carnitas (plate, burrito, taco, whatever) are the best items here.  The carne asada is okay, and the pozole is passable.  All in all I wouldn't make a special trip but if you live in the neighborhood and want some good, fast, drive thru Mexican food there is NO reason to go to Roberto's."}
{"text":"Great Mexican \"fast food\" joint. The food is better than some of the pricier restaurants in town....  I would recommend take out though, it's small and warm inside. Chile verde and camarones empanizados are the best menu items for lunch and breakfast is all great. It's really good fast food!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The staff is really friendly and the chile verde burrito is fantastic.  You know a mexican restaurant is good when most of the customers are hispanic.  I eat here for lunch three or four times a week.  Best cheap mexican food in Vegas."}
{"text":"if you want a neighborhood place that is simple and delicious, Tacos El Burrito Loco is that place. LV natives know the difference between authentic and 'americanized' Mexican food. Every time I eat here I thank the good lord that our neighbors to the south have brought there awesome cuisine to our region. I like to get nachos with chile verde or pastor. The carne asada is muy bueno. The service is great if you yourself are friendly.  Brink your own beer if you like. If you don't have a sophisticated pallet or think Mexican food is only about tacos, there are other places. For those who live in Central Las Vegas, we know the best kept secret for Mexican food.Tacos El Burrito Loco  Sadly new owners at Tacos El Burrito Loco have not been able to sustain the quality of service. They charge to use a credit card. They have attempted to keep the food quality the same but have not been able to hold the line."}
{"text":"I love this place I was brought here by my coworkers at first I thought omg were did they brinn me? But after eating their food I can say I have become a faithful customer,  if u want good mexican food and a good price well this is the place to go!!! Try the Menudo my favorite. ."}
{"text":"Went today and had some Camarones Rancheros. The plate was delicious and filling. The prices are great and so is the staff. I haven't had any problems dining in or taking out so far."}
{"text":"This is solid Mexican food for the money. I get take-out from them a few times a month as they are just around the corner from my house.  The burritos are reasonably priced and incredibly filling and the combination plates are fine. DO make sure you ask for sauces or salsa on take-out orders as they don't have a salsa bar.  The TV is always turned to a Mexican station (understandable) and the clientele is mostly Mexican (something good to see in a Mexican restaurant)."}
{"text":"Omg, to be honest i dont even want to share this place because its so good. i like that its not busy and sooo good.  If your looking for delicious , inexpensive, authentic mexican food. GO HERE."}
{"text":"Miss the OLD management :( This place is expensive, food is bland and has the WORST customer service!!! I was treated disrespectfully when I requested my food to please be re-made because it came with guacomole. I have a severe allergy. The girl at the drive thru window caught an attitude with me, SNATCHED the bag back through the window INJURING my finger!! I was shocked and livid!! NO LONGER A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot .the best was the shrimp tostadas. Prices were great !, food WAS great. Just couple of months ago the business was sold, I just went yesterday to give it a try again  ( January 2017)The prices when up very much and new food was added to the menu. I still wanted to give it a try. I  bought Chile relleno burritos. One for my husband and one for myself.. till right now I have stomachache and diarrhea. My husband it's worst. Will never be back . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT. the cashier helps make the food.. I will be calling the health department if by tomorrow we don't feel better."}
{"text":"Small place I always pass but always forget to try.   I ordered the Al Pastor burrito. No one in front of me and time of service was fast. I love when places wrap a burrito in aluminum foil because that keeps it warm while you are bringing it home. Couple of good things off the bat.   But...I couldn't wait to try.   It was a good sized burrito. Not too big and not too small. Full of meat. It was just a tad bit on the bland side but they automatically give two salsas so not really a big deal. I used to run a taco shop in La Jolla and I know that recipes can often times change the need of spices and seasoning. Although, I do like a more rich flavor than most which might be more than other people's taste. But, like I said, there's salsas automatically added so it's not like you have to feel cheap for asking for more. And, it's always better to have a dish that you can add the amount of flavor you want rather than having too much. So, not exactly a bad thing that it was a little bland. I actually like that better thinking about it. Price was justified. It was 6 bucks so pretty good actually.   Overall was really impressed. Tasty. Fast. Fair Value. And a couple little things that make me definitely want to try other items on the menu. I will be back."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now tried the chicken, carne, and pastor tacos all very good complimentary chips and salsa (I dined in) also very good."}
{"text":"For lunch or a anytime, good take out. Very tasty food, and five star worthy for what it is (although almost four since the chips could have been fresh). Still great food for great price, very friendly staff. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I expected the breakfast burritos to have more potential, although they were only $4. Will be back to try tacos for lunch though."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place is under new ownership, but it feels like a completely different restaurant from the place I had been going to for over 8 years.  The changes all of a sudden included raised prices on all their items, no more chips and salsa, no more free refills on soda, smaller portions, lower quality and a entirely new staff.  You used to have to fight to get a table at this tiny place for lunch, and on this day, my friend and I were the only people in the entire place from 12-1pm on a Friday. Not a good sign.  I hope things turn around, as I've really enjoyed this establishment for many years, but  don't think they're going to make it at this rate."}
{"text":"This is a great little hole-in-the-wall  Mexican restaurant.  Family owned.  Husband, Wife & brother run the place.  They have great $2.99 breakfast burritos as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat that has the best food for being hungover... Mariscos we're good and the Menudo was great and they had some in a Thursday I will definitely be coming back every time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have tried this place.   The menu was full of options and everything looks great.   I ordered the wet burrito with rice and it was delicious.   I only gave it a 3 star because it was missing the salsa bar and without it the food is not authentic to me.  However, after I finished. I noticed that you can ordered that at the window, which would be helpful if it was offered when I ordered."}
{"text":"This place occupies an old FARM BASKET so it looks like a barn. It is always dead. Really old & worn looking. Kinda smells moldy. I made the mistake of ordering lunch one day. 2 tacos combo(with Rice & Beans) It was ALL cold & flavorless & Pricey. Family works next door for 3 years and has eaten there just the 1 occasion. Service was ??-How can you tell when they just NOD!! Way better Mexican food in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy my experience at all. I just left and I feel disgusted. I'm still hungry and I feel sick to my stomach. For the record, the food was less than average and the atmosphere was uninviting. I was so excited to try this place, but now I'm regretting it 1000%.  I ordered 2 Large Shrimp Tacos, 2 Small Chicken Tacos, 2 Small Steak Tacos, 1 WET Steak Burrito, 1 Chicken Nacho and 1 Chimichangas, which came with rice and beans.  Let me mention, I had a voucher that took $15 off my total. I asked the cashier if we would get chips and salsa while waiting for our food. The lady told me, \"Chips and Salsa are only for customers who eat there.\" I told her that we were eating there. She then said, \"No, customers who order, maybe a Cnchiladas Combo and they're waiting for their food.\" She then said, \"you're already getting a good deal.\" I told her that I had to pay for the voucher, so it's not like i'm getting over. She said, \"oh, I know, but it's still a good deal.\" I have to admit, I was upset, she wasn't treating us like an equal, just because I was getting a discount.  Either way, it took like 15 minutes for us to get our food. They bagged it all To-Go as if we couldn't eat there. We politely, picked a seat and sat down. We un-bagged all of our food and started taking pictures and eating. Let me mention, no one ever came over and asked if we needed anything or offered water or anything.  I started on the chicken nachos. I noticed that the chicken meat was in a food warmer, and I guess the warmer wasn't doing its job, because the chicken wasn't warm, at all. The chicken was really cold and the nachos were dry. They didn't have enough cheese or anything. I ate a lot of them, simply because I didn't want to waste food or money.  The Shrimp Tacos were average. Nothing special there. The Chicken and Steak Tacos were all below average. The chicken, again, was cold. The steak was warmer but it just did't taste like Steak. The shells were also disgusting.  The WET Steak burrito was probably the best thing we ordered. I ate half of it before I got sick. I believe the sauce massed the flavor of the actually burrito. I really just tasted sauce, but the sauce tasted better than everything else.  I didn't get a chance to taste the Chimichanga Combo, because I was already sick to my stomach. I'm not sure if the cold food that caused it or the fact that nothing tasted like real food. It may have been when I thought about the fact that the cook doesn't wear gloves and he also has full conversations over food. Either way, I was sick and we left.  My friend and I both agreed that we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I had high expectations coming into this restaurant because I love Guy, however the food portions were rather small and it was nothing out of the ordinary. I had the carnitas taco. The guacamole was good. The churros were good and big the tres leches was not good.   There is something that it amazing and that is the service. Everyone has an amazing positive attitude. They all work in team.... I might have order the wrong item so I will give them a second try.   For now my rating is 3 just because of my plate"}
{"text":"I wish I could review this place on the Mexican food. I had the hotdogs there for national hotdog day and I was surprised at how good they were. I will go back just for the hotdogs."}
{"text":"It was more a 3.5 but since someone gave them a 1 star they get a 4.   This place is decent, the carne asada  is good but a little salty but i dont like much salt on anything I eat.   the Al Pastor was not good, it was not from a rotating spit, it tatsed pre-cooked, definately dont order that.   It's a nice mom and pop shop, prices are cheap. 1.07 for a taco and 4.99 for a burrito, that is a steal!.   Overall I would return and try some of the other stuff."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast burrito and salsa. I have been stopping by this restaurant for years and the food has always been great. I ordered a breakfast burrito and it was made to order and brought to my table with chips and salsa within just a few minutes. The exterior of the building is aged and run down a bit, but I am not there to eat the building."}
{"text":"I don't know what the chick giving this place one star was talking about. This place has always been good to me and my family. The food is good and fairly priced.  Akeeela sounds like she had a chip on her shoulder and went in there with an attitude. The service has always been good."}
