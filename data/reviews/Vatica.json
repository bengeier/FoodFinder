{"text":"This is a delivery only food service. No dine-in.  I've been traveling from Boston to Toronto over the past several months. I missed eating home cooked veggie Indian food. I didn't have a car so this was perfect for me. Just call Vatica and freshly prepared food is delivered to your door-step.  I ordered dinner from Vatica 2-3 times a week. Mostly got the veggie thali (combo platter) which has chapati's (indian bread), 2 vegetable dishes, 2 soups (1 lentil, 1 kadi or rajma), 1 dessert, rice and pickle. The flavors are a combination of West (Gujrati) and North Indian. Although they have South Indian as well. The Veggie Thali menu items change daily. Call them to ask whats good today.  The price is quite affordable.  Don't forget to tip for delivery!"}
{"text":"Had diarrhea the morning after eating this food. The veggies (okra) tasted a bit funky, so I didn't eat it, but the damage was done."}
{"text":"All dishes taste same. Owner is a bit rude. We went from Etobicoke to this place which is quite far just for Undhiyu but he reacted a bit rude. I know it was my mistake I should have called him before going there as he said we have to inform him first and place the order over the phone but since last few days I was having cravings for Undhiyu. He could have been replied in a better way rather than being rude.  Plus these people are really really slow!!"}
{"text":"Excellent samosas. :)  They serve only vegetarian food and its inexpensive, and tasty. It's a take out, but dine in space is available for 2-4 people in total."}
{"text":"Quite a humble restaurant. The food is amazing in general - especially their Thali, Curries, and Dal. Their Puri Bhaji (Aloo) is something perfect on a chilly day. We aren't a fan of some of the other items like Spring Roll (too less filling inside), Chats (not so flavorful) and Pani Puri (not so good masala). However, overall, they are pretty great when it comes to homely food.  Their major focus seems to be on takeaway since we felt students and young professionals are their major customer segment. Inside the restaurant, there is hardly a capacity of 5-6 people.  The service is very slow, so even if you are eating in, you may just want to call them and order ahead, so that it is ready by the time you reach (in about 15-20 mins). Having said that, the quality of food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good Indian food, really liked their quantity of every serving. Great for short office lunch. I took a light meal which was pretty sufficient for one person. Would definitely visit again."}
