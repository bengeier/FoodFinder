{"text":"Easy wasn't easy. I considered getting a smoothie and word on the street is their coffee is stellar.   But it was busy, and after about 10-15 minutes, with no coffee, we left before ordering."}
{"text":"This place is Our FAVE.. we are regulars to this roncies location, and my husband and I adore the staff, and the food, Coffee is amazing, food is always hot and deeelish..and they will always accommodate you when it comes to changing or adding anything to your order, not too many places with do that especially when it's so busy, during breakfast or brunch time.. the line cook's are freeking amazing they can knock out your order in record time, and I don't think I've ever had them make a mistake with an order..I recommend the shakes, they are a serious meal be prepared to take them with you, there HUGE.. I'm a big fan of the Huevos they are so yummy.. you won't be disappointed..I recommend this place 100% .."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch, amazing coffee, amazing service. Every single staff member was great and helpful.  Food was excellent! The place is ALWAYS busy so that must say something!"}
{"text":"Based on the recommendation from Yelp... I decided to go to Easy for my Birthday... which was on Friday...  SOOOO YUMMMMYYYYYYY!  I had the Huevos Divorciados... I was definitely NOT disappointed!  The only reason why they didn't get full marks was not because of the back-in-the-day décor, but because the back-in-the-day décor needs a bit of varnish. :) Had to give the heads up...  Who cares... I love this place and will definitely be back!  Cheers!  P.S. When you leave you don't feel overfull, but you do feel satisfied. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot with history and a theme. Is it worth the hype? yes and no.  The place is small and has plenty of character (something most new places lack), although they seem to take the crowd for granted. Prices are slightly above what the food delivers and the decor is really bad.   One thing I have to say I love is their use of avocado. I wish more places used it as much in their menu. Also a plus, their red potato home fries. Really good.  Even though they only get 3.5 stars, I'll add them to my got-a-craving breakfast list. Will visit again."}
{"text":"I am always very happy with brunch at Easy. The service is fast, the servers are friendly. The Huevros Divorciados are excellent, a breakfast for those who often experience food envy (great for those envious of their neighbours dishes, as there are so many flavours on the same plate, you won't get bored and have time to look over at the table next to you). Their home fries are very well seasoned. The Queen Western omelette is flavourful and well balanced."}
{"text":"I ended up at this place by accident after I sat in a place down the road a little ways for about 20 minutes waiting for my order to be taken, so I left and walked down to this place.  We were actually reading the menu in the window and a girl eating inside caught us and gave us a huge thumbs up, which was really all the convincing we needed.  I had the Huevos Divorciados with homefries, and it was delicious.  I also loved the homefries.  (contrary to a couple other reviews I've just read)  The server actually recommended it, and I'm glad he did.  My friend had the Tortilla Chicken soup, and she liked it quite a bit as well.  All in all, great experience, and I'll definitely go back if I'm down in the area."}
{"text":"My order: I ordered the BLT and oh my god was it a let down. The bun was mediocre at best, there was barely any avocado. There were exactly two sun-dried tomatoes on my sandwich. The bacon was overdone. The actual BLT was probably the worst BLT I've ever had.  The side. Was potatoes. Which were overdone.  My gfs order: eggs were done right. Everything else was again overdone. Sausage - overdone, potatoes - overdone.  The place gas a cool ambiance, very good service, but I would never go there to eat. Maybe to have a cold water.   Also had their peanut milkshake. Which destroyed my stomach and made me really gassy...  WOULD HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"solid food.  decent service.  reasonable price.  there is nothing wrong with this place.  it's just that there is a lot of brunch places in the neighborhood and there is nothing really special about this one.  I had an eggs benny and it was very good."}
{"text":"First time here, eating at many breakfast spots. This one is a great place. Had the banana shake with espresso(way better than Starbucks) had the west coast toast breakfast. Perfect portion very good home fries, eggs cooked perfectly,good sauce a must try spot"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto to visit some friends and had some time to spare during the day while she was at work and he was at school. After rummaging through their fridge, I found out there was nothing to eat in the apartment so I decided to find a nice place to sit down for a late breakfast. The Easy Restaurant was recommended from another friend, so I headed out the door and made my way to Queen west for some good eats. When I got to the restaurant there were a few people enjoying their food, and I found a nice little table and sat down to check out the menu. The selection was just what I had in mind, but I couldn't decide between the eggs benedict or the French toast. After getting some advice from the nice looking waitress, I decided on the benedict which was promised to be more filling than the French toast. While waiting for the food I pulled out a copy of NOW magazine and started reading an article about the shitty new Toronto mayor. Before I had time to read the whole article, my meal was sitting on the table waiting to be eaten. A few bites in, I knew I had made the right choice and started to worry that I wouldn't be able to finish. But I didn't want the waitress to think I couldn't handle a large breakfast, so I filled my mouth with bite after bite of eggs benedict, homefries, and house salad, and washed it down with freshly squeezed orange juice. I could tell she was impressed with my manly appetite so I left a nice tip and ventured outside to walk it off."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want a plate of grease. I had a standard egg breakfast. My boyfriend ordered huevos ranchos (sp?). Both came in a plate of grease with a side of grease with grease to put on it. It was FREEZING in the restaurant and dirty. I won't go back"}
{"text":"I've gone to the Parkdale location a few times before and happen to stumble on the College St. recently. Thinking of tex mex and starving I had a late breakfast. I remember the Huevos Divorciados being yummy - but it was $14!! Don't remember paying that much for it before. With the gluten-free bread on top of that, I thought a $16 breakfast was a bit too much and settled for the breakfast tacos. Nothing fancy and something I feel I could have made myself. I'd have to agree with others that this place is overpriced for a diner. The service was just ok (she was by herself) and the coffee was also $3 for drip coffee! My food wasn't very warm as well.   Points for gluten-free options (bread and the gf tortilla) - though the mark-up is higher than other gf breakfast options.   If the food was amazing - I could understand, but relative to what you can get in the area, just doesn't seem worth it."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch after a recommendation that the food was to die for but we were not able to find out.  The waitress was very rude and told us that we would have to wait outside before they could seat us - even though there were many open tables.  We obliged for about 10 minutes until we saw that the tables were not being cleaned so we went back in to remind her as well as warm up - it was a very cold and windy day and we were told we had to get back outside - we were absolutely not allowed to wait inside. Even though the wind was unbearable and there were many places to sit.  The waitress then started walking towards us basically pushing us out the door. I can honestly say I've never received such bad customer services in my life."}
{"text":"One of the only reasons why I'm writing this review is because I am an avid buyer of Huevos Rancheros (or any derivative in and around it - like Divorciados at EASY).  The front area is a pain to have to wait in - so we step outside if it's a good day and wait for a table to free.  The seating is firm and straight, cramped usually, yet offers an intimacy.  Don't go here on a first breakfast date, you'll be rubbing knees and getting coffee breath whiffs - although not likely any worse than the Lakeview seating.  The Divorciados is their 'house specialty', and they nail it every time. The beans and salsa, avocado and ancho-jam is delicious - pair it with green salsa, runny eggs, and the thick but bubbly bread and you've got a meal that will last until 3 or 4pm, depending on how much you drank the night before.  Fantastic coffee, although I didn't give them a 5-Star rating because of one issue: one of their waitresses is so nonchalant and blase it's a bit annoying.  I don't like waitresses that are in your face - but I am annoyed at the ones who take their jobs too lightly - with or without a hangover themselves.  THE FIRST REFILL OF COFFEE SHOULD COME PROMPTLY, although the 2nd could come at the end of the meal - agreed? Also no 5-Star rating: I once ordered Steak and Eggs and unfortunately had to trade my grey piece of leather in for what I ordered - fresh and red, and grass-fed. Damn!  I love this place - for its energy, its brunch, and its great tasting coffee."}
{"text":"Contrary to my pal david my experience was better there was no hair in my food. I like the smoothies they helped me heal from wisdom tooth extraction and conveniently i could get them downstairs when i lived in that building 2 years ago. so for that i am greatfull. I think it is overpriced for eggs and toast however i don\"t eat eggs as i am allergic so i can't comment on if they are great or bad. i guess the prices reflect the other hipster joints in the area your other option is greasy spoon Stavros. So if hipsters and high prices are not your thing then avoid this place."}
{"text":"Consistently great!  I frequent the Easy about once per month for breakfast or brunch and I am never disappointed.  The portions aren't huge, but they are filling none the less.  I usually have the huevos divorcados (sp?) or the breakfast burrito with chorizo and both are very filling and delicious.  The eggs are always cooked exactly how you ask, and the poached eggs have always been nice and soft and runny when I have ordered them.  The grapefruit juice tastes like they have just squeezed the fruit directly into your glass, so good that I don't usually eat the fruit that is served on the side of most of their breakfasts.  This is not a huge restaurant but is usually able to accommodate large groups, so it is ideal if you are looking for a place to spend some time catching up with a group of friends.  If you are looking for a delicious and laid back breakfast go here.  Not pretentious at all, and service is always friendly.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A go-to in the 'hood and though the service can sometimes be on the slow side, the food is tasty, big portions and if you can't decide between home fries and salad, they'll give you half and half!  Things I've had:  Smoothies: almost more than I can drink  Steak and fries: cooked a bit more than I had asked but  they don't skimp on the veggies  Ham and cheese omelette: carmelized onions in an omelette?  Amazing!  Chipotle chicken on spelt toast:  avocado makes most things good.  Nice alternative to a classic club.  Super chill atmosphere, movie poster decor is amusing.  Yes, it gets crowded on weekends and I have had to wait upwards of 45mins to get a table.  But what good brunch/brekky joint doesn't have a line?"}
{"text":"Very expensive, uncooked home fries, slow service, long wait.... Will never go back.  Bad service, dirty tables. Stay away."}
{"text":"Very expensive, potatoes uncooked. Long wait to get a table. Milk shakes are okay... Will never go back or recommended to anyone. $80 for 2 breakfasts one with Shake, other one with orange juice? BS!"}
{"text":"We had \"huevos divorciados\" and \"vegetarian tostada\", both were expensive and underwhelming. Huevos was drenched in like 3 salsas and guac, turning into essentially a tortilla black bean soup. Tried the tostada also, which was virtually the same as the huevos except with mushrooms and some herbs. Also nothing special. There are far better brunches in the city. At least we had good service (for eating at 1:30pm on a Saturday)."}
{"text":"Easy Restaurant is somewhere i would like to return to.  Great food, pretty cool people, great location.  Personally I love the \"endless\" Illy Coffee for 3$.  Not good for people who can't handle their caffeine :)  When i was there, i had the \"huevos Divorciados\" and it was good.  I didn't like it - but it wasn't anything the cook could control.  The food was high-quality and i was super impressed by the thickness of the scrambled egg.  The guacamole was amazing.  As were the black beans.  The home-made sweet jelly stuff - the \"ancho-jam\" was good, but was something i didn't like too much (i also hate marmalade, so this is probably something to do with it).  And then the corn tortilla at the very bottom of everything ended up being soggy and kinda unappetizing by the time i ate my way towards it.  Also, as much as i think the servers are totally cool and nice people, it is hit or miss, depending on how busy the restaurant is.  When i went on a friday morning, the service was fast and attentive.  When i went on a Monday morning when busy, the service was extremely slow and we had to go and ask to order our food.  In their defense though, we had multiple people coming at different times, so it might have been hard to keep track.  I would like to come to the restaurant again and check out some of their other dishes.  My friend's weekly special of pancakes looked phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I am sad but it seems like things are changing at what used to be my favourite brunch spot, and I wanted to hopefully warn the other celiacs/gluten-free people. I have been coming here for years, since this location opened, and as a celiac I've always been assured that there's a separate grill/toaster, and that the cooking staff are very conscientious about cross-contamination because the owner is gluten-free. However, today at brunch, the woman at the table next to me ordered, told the server she was celiac, and was reassured that it was a very safe place to eat.   I had a different server, and when it came time to give my order, mine told me that the bread was toasted in the same toaster as the gf bread, that there was only one shared grill, and that cross contamination was very likely. WTF.  The woman next to me was told none of these things. I have always been assured that the Easy is safe and allergen conscious, but now I don't know what to think. I'm very worried and confused, and I don't feel that anyone who's celiac/gf should go to the Easy, absent a coherent explanation of how they prepare food items. On top of that, my brunch item was burnt. So disappointing."}
{"text":"We showed up half an hour before close and the service was quick and polite.  Great all-day breakfast.  I had what I think was called the Easy Rider Breakfast, which was a healthy mix of spinach, potato fries, eggs, bacon and grapefruit.  My girlfriend got some waffles off the kids' menu, which they were cool about.  Both meals were exceptional.  The orange juice is also fresh squeezed, which is nice since we were expecting to get something from concentrate.  Also like the funky old-Hollywood theme."}
{"text":"Food is yummy and the service meets my high standards. My fav Sunday brunch. I love the homemade beans, guacamole and ancho ketchup. Only complaint is that it's always too noisy. But a full happy dining room isn't so bad."}
{"text":"This place has cute booths and offers a really solid brunch. They're quite popular, but the turnover is quick and the staff is very professional.   The Huevos Divorciados and Toast Soldiers are perfect dishes for people (like me) who like to dunk and dip, and play with their food. The peanut power smoothie is thick and delicious and could easily replace a meal, but that's never going to happen because I refuse to miss out on their fresh baguettes and tasty, tasty homefries."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Easy restaurant the first weekend opened, and to tell you the truth we were unimpressed. The portions were really stingy, and home fries tasted  like burnt olive oil.  I live across the street from the restaurant and there are only a few options for a good greasy breakfast spot, so a few months later I decided to give them another shot.   The interior is very cool. An old Firebird hood dawns the wall, and there are posters of all the classic race movies. On interior and design I would give them 5 stars   the presentation of the food also 5 stars.   But when it comes to the important things like taste and value 3 stars. The portions were so small, out of disbelief I literally counted the home fries and there were 9 tiny pieces of potato on my plate. I don't mind spending money if I get good value - and when it comes to breakfast value is so 'easy' to give, most of the materials like eggs and potatoes are super cheap, all I ask is to feed me. After dropping 16 dollars on huevos divorciados I iterally went to subway sandwiches next door and got a 6 inch sandwich because I was still hungry."}
{"text":"I gave this place a good go, you know what I mean?   I've been twice. The first time the service was bad and slow.  Second time, the service hadn't changed and the food was as mediocre as I remembered.   I'm not saying it's terrible; the food isn't bad but it doesn't exactly surpass a place like Golden Griddle, and for the price, I expected it to. The last time I went my homefries tasted like they had been sitting out for a while.   The only good things I can really say about this place is their menu is nice looking, the place is nice looking, and the coffee is good."}
{"text":"I'm seriously in love with this place. It only gets 4 stars since the service is a bit dodgy, a bit inexplicably pretentious. The chocolate peanut butter smoothie is a must. It's 4 star food meets diner--how could you not love that?"}
{"text":"We were there on a Sunday, late morning for brunch.  The restaurant is crowded, but service is quick and efficient. They turn around tables in about 30 minutes or less. It's great for a quick brunch (in a crowded place). It's nearby, parking across the street was free, and the huevos divorciados and ceasars were the best!"}
{"text":"Thanks to these reviews, I knew exactly what to go for: Toast Soldiers.  Not only did it satisfy my hunger and stave off any potential hangover (along with a diner-standard mug of coffee), but I got a plastic army soldier out of the deal!  More attractive and stylish than your typical diner and food comes out in a flash - perfect for instant gratification. Even has relatively healthy options like opting for salad with vinagrette instead of fries. Not your typical greasy spoon.  Now I just need someone to teach me how to eat a soft-boiled egg properly."}
{"text":"It's good, quick option if not a little over priced. I've never left hungry and the service has always been attentive but not over bearing.   Summed up, if you're in a hurry and in the area give it a try."}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant! This place is usually packed and while that might be a set back for some, it usually means a place is delicious. I love the atmosphere of this restaurant and their food is amazing. I definitely suggest ordering the Eggs Benedict because this is one of the best in the GTA."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Easy for months now and have to say, it wasn't spectacular. I don't particularly enjoy the attitude given by the \"too cool for school\" west end style of service, I believe in the classic friendly, go-out-of-your-way style of table service.   All of that being said no one was rude to me and my food was decent. I especially loved the banana latte smoothie I had, but I have definitely had better breakfast in Toronto. I had the herb omelette and I'm pretty sure the herbs were old because they tasted off, maybe it was the combination of flavours, or maybe it just needs to be simplified. When I asked for beans on the side my server reluctantly said \"i guess so\", it turned out that it wasn't even worth asking for.  It maybe sound like a mediocre review but I will definitely return and try something new to give it another shot. First impressions were alright."}
{"text":"This is always the first place I bring out of towners for breakfast because it's always a safe bet.  Great food, fast/friendly service, decent price, what more do you want? :)  People say it's crowded, but that depends on the time of day, really. I find even when it is a bit crowded the food still comes out fast and you don't mind at all.  Great breakfasts for those who don't eat meat, as well. Bonus for me!"}
{"text":"We've been about 5 times now, always for brunch, and are definite fans.  I've tried both the Breakfast Burrito and the Huevos Divorciados, and enjoyed both.  The Huevos Divorciados left me so full it hurt.  My husband has tried both of those, and also the Steak & Eggs, and had positive reviews of each.    Here's where I'm at a loss:  I LOVE French Toast.  I try it at least once at every brunch place I ever go to.  And so far, the only one I've really been dissatisfied with, is Easy's.  They do everything else very well.  But the \"French Toast Croissant\" is priced at $12.95, and that's really all it is.... a croissant cooked like French Toast.... no sides except a tiny bit of fruit.  If you want to add bacon, it's an extra $2.95.  The price seems extremely disproportionate to the Huevos Divorciados, which is made with far more ingredients, and is only $12.75, and the Breakfast Burrito which is only $10.95.  Both of those even come with guacamole (which is notoriously expensive at most eateries), and homefries!  So I say, skip the French Toast.  It will leave you hungry and empty-pocketed.  But other than that, we've loved the meals.  Line-ups haven't been too bad, although it's a pain waiting outside.  Atmosphere is that of a quick-service restaurant.  You won't want to stay all day, but you'll enjoy the time you're there."}
{"text":"I am re - reviewing the places I have returned to after a year away from the country.  This time I will keep things simple.  No hairs in my food this time... however I have now visited the place 3 times in the last 2 weeks as I live next door.  Each time the brekkie potatoes were cold.  It's really really expensive and I don't ever intend going again."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant at about 4:45 PM for last minute take-out (called ahead of time to see if that would be alright). I ordered an item from the menu (eggs florentine) and received the wrong order (quantity of 2 instead of 3). My boyfriend went back in to ask if we were over-charged as we weren't told that the order was changed in accordance to what was in stock. Luckily, that wasn't the case so I asked the owner why the meal itself wasn't done right as most of the food looked charred (not a clean grill) and the eggs were basically boiled (very over-cooked) and ripping down the middle. The owner tried to justify himself by saying it was poached and when I just pointed out the qualities of the food to show it had been over done (no runny middle) the owner got angry and decided to throw a $20 dollar  bill on the table while grabbing the food from my hands and said, \"OK, you want a refund? Here's a refund\". When I looked confused due to his over-reaction, he decided to slap the money on the food and left it on the table saying, \"or you know what? Just take both!\" and decided to walk away. I was very upset with the way he reacted over a simple question where the order could have been fixed or he could have kindly addressed the issue. I decided to pass the bill back towards the waitresses who were also upset with me (I can't figure out why as I never was contemptuous in my manners nor did I throw around any slurs?) I was very upset and walked out. I hope the owner himself or his staff can read this for the sake of simple acknowledgement and a promise to deliver service with a bit more dignity for their customers, especially when their clients are travelling from other cities and would like to support you."}
{"text":"Fun place , great decor and good service. Two quick notes their is not air conditioning so inside on a hot day it can be very uncomfortable and the home fries are really bland choose the salad."}
{"text":"Easy restaurant - nothing distinguishable from other restaurants and brunch places around. The place is often busy so service leaves room for improvement. As for the food, it was tasty but somewhat expensive for me. They have some creative items on the menu but even the simple ones - eggs and toast - will set you back $10.  I got a toy soldier with my army themed breakfast dish which made all of us laugh. If you live in this upcoming hipster-ish area, maybe this is a place for you, but otherwise, I won't bother..."}
{"text":"I like this place - it's casual and has a nice vibe. The food has always been good when I've gone - I've had the chicken soup, half chicken, BLT, fries and paninis - never breakfast food  - usually more lunch type food and it's always been quite good.   The service is always friendly - my main complaint would be that it can take awhile - go when you're not in a rush.  This is near my work and I would love to go on my lunch break more often but it takes too long even though it's usually not that crowded on a weekday at lunch.  The other complaint is that it's freezing in the winter with all the cold air blowing in every time the door opens.  But on a spring day when I've got an extra long lunch, I am there!"}
{"text":"I have searched the city for the best huevos rancheros. Easy Restaurant gets the prize for its huevos divorciados (a slight variation of huevos rancheros). Died and gone to heaven delicious."}
{"text":"Yummy brunch, friendly and funny staff, interesting decor, interesting crowd and vibe.  Would definitely return.  Service was a teeny bit slow."}
{"text":"I don't give one star very often. But this place has terrible service. The staff is clearly there to hang out and socialize amongst themselves and not too concerned with their clientele.  We work hard for our money, if you are treating yourself (and a friend) to brunch you deserve a place where they appreciate your business. Boom is right up the street. Superior service, good food and better prices. Go there."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a Monday - it was really busy though the single server was very efficient and friendly, cleaning a booth for us after a child had thrown food everywhere. The space is cosy and bright - a lot of people seemed so comfortable I suspect they were spending all afternoon there.   My quesadilla was pretty big and tasty - I liked being able to go for the half-half on sides. Definitely planning to go back to try waffles and the smoothies which I saw other tables order."}
{"text":"Overpriced. I've been here twice now and both times disappointed. Disappointed enough to write a review. First time was H. Rancheros. Whatever it was fine but nothing special or super delicious. Today I got the Taco Salad. Big mistake. A few flakes of spinach, maybe 7 chips, handful of canned corn, plain black beans, quarter wedge of a lime, a small scoop of guacamole, a few halved cherry tomatoes, and a sprinkle of some sort of cheese for $13. No dressing. Take it off the menu or call it Basic Salad.   The only reason it got two stars instead of one is that the service is great. Except for the long wait times."}
{"text":"The food here is very good, I have the egg benedict and the huevos divorciados.  Both times I loved my breakfast.    Noise in this place is pretty horrible though.  The bar has a blender setup right in the middle of the restaurant that is probably the loudest I've ever heard.  Why it's not setup in the kitchen instead is a bit of a mystery or atleast a quieter model...  The other frustration is that it's cash or debit only.  There is a single debit machine by the bar so expect to line up their when you want to pay."}
{"text":"Easy is a great place for breakfast if you are craving a slow and frustrating meal.   The single waitress will initially appear overwhelmed and relatively competent but you'll quickly discover she has no clue that you want to order food or what you want after you order it...  If you'er lucky enough to get your order in, you'll soon see the cooks and kitchen staff clearing tables or delivering food and you'll wonder why they aren't cooking your food.  You might get more frustrated when you see the only 3 employees in the restaurant having a 5 min confab in the back, while approximately 50 customers wait...  When the food does arrive it will probably be cold, if not its usually quite tasty and really the only reason this restaurant is still around.  Avoid at all costs on the weekend or any time when you see the customers out number staff at greater than 10 to 1..."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend, based on reviews. Anyways, we both ordered the eggs Benedict. I got fries and salad with mine and he ordered just fries. Our server gave him salad instead. She apologized and brought him a side of fries which was fine. The salad was just spinach with no dressing on it, I don't know how plain spinach counts as a \"salad\" but ok.  The fries although seasoned were tasteless. We ended up adding a lot of salt to give it some taste. The hollandaise sauce was nothing special. Not a horrible place to eat but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Il nous a fallu du temps pour y aller. Pourquoi ? Je n'en sais trop rien. On y mange bien, tacos ou fajita au petit déjeuner, cuisine de \"Diner\" avec une petite touche originale."}
{"text":"Just came here for breakfast after my bachelorette party with my cousins and my sister. We were told by the bald server at the door that there would be a wait and there were a couple groups in front of us. He said that as soon as he served the next group he'd let us know how long it would be. 45 minutes passed and several groups of people were served, so my cousin asked  how much longer it would be. He said he wasn't sure but there was one more group in front of us. Obviously we were all starving and hungover, but at this point we'd already spent enough time waiting so we decided to wait a bit longer. The next group was served, and then another. Then a group that had clearly come after us was served! I told the guy (the same bald guy that that took our names and told us we were next) that we came before that group and we were basically told too bad. As we were leaving he even shouted after us \"well that works out for (the next group)!\" This was after we had already waited over an hour!!!  This place is actually the worst.  **UPDATE**  I was contacted recently by the owner, Peter Morrison, who apologized for the lack of service and offered to buy us breakfast. Unfortunately, we couldn't make it the following weekend due to busy schedules and a holiday in Jamaica. I can't seem to find the original message now, but I wanted to update my review and add +1 stars for actually contacting me to apologize!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places in Toronto. Granted, I've only tried the huevos diverociodo, it is the perfect combination of flavors. If I was a rich man I would eat here every day. But alas, I usually only save it for special occasions. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. Service is great and everyone's very friendly and accommodating. As I was writing this review,a friend called me to ask what they should order at this restaurant, just a little coincidence that speaks to the popularity of this place."}
{"text":"Solid brunch! First, this is a haven for those with gluten free company - the corn tortillas make everything edible, but they even have gluten free waffles! These were genuinely tasty (not just \"tasty for a gluten free waffle\")  The Huevos Divorciados were another pleasant surprise. Corn tortillas make all the difference, and the chorizo was excellent. I'd go back in an instant."}
{"text":"Taking its name from the flick Easy Rider, this bright and airy Parkdale breakfast spot has recently expanded to serve even more of the hipster musician crowd that flocks to their tables for weekend brunch.  Try the Huevos Divorciados or the Toast Soldiers; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend of mine lives directly across the street from Easy. While some people may not think this is super cool, it actually is and I'll tell you why. I can spy on the front door of it and see when it's filling up (and it regularly does)...and if it is, I like to make a sprint for the door and plop myself into the nearest free booth. Immediately a server will come by with a menu and the offering of a coffee. Not just any coffee, but delicious illy coffee...and the refills don't stop until you put at least one hand up.   I've only ever eaten from the breakfast menu, but it is more than delightful. I especially love and often crave (when taking a Toronto hiatus) the huevos divorciados. That's a mouthful to say and I assure you, it is to eat too. This order comes with two eggs on a corn tortilla, re-fried black beans, guacamole (omnomnom), green and red salsa, and another lil treat called ancho jam. Pile all this yumminess on a piece of toasted baguette and you have officially started off a stellar morning.  If you end up at Easy, you should also be so inclined to try their smoothies. The peanut power smoothie is a meal in itself. I was full for 24 hours after consuming one and did not even consider taking another bite of food during this time. If that's not a great money saver, I don't know what is.   I can't wait to once again spy on Easy and return to kill the items on their menu that I haven't tried yet. I just need to remember not to order a meal AND a smoothie. Lesson learned and duly noted...I think."}
{"text":"Ok, look, Yelp. We've had some good times, you know, you've recommended some great places, I've helped you out with some first reviews, its been good, its been, you know, a relationship that approaches equilibrium at times. I won't lie, there have been betrayals, there have been some letdowns, but you know, I was willing to forgive, I was always willing to move on.  And then I heard about the Easy reviews.   I wasn't willing to believe at first, you know how it is: your friends are jealous, inventing stories, malicious bitches....  but...but then I looked, and I knew.   You had betrayed me Yelp, your aggregate review of Easy was so idiotically skewed by people who had clearly wandered in off the street with no concept of that restaurant's internal logic, the beauty of its mechanisms, the harmony of its spheres: and then, with no concern, with not even a thought for the infinity of possibility that lay outside their shallow, one-off, ill informed experience, they callously tossed off a three, two, or, god forbid, one star review, most likely forgetting the experience as soon as it was done...like some sort of  horrid date rapist moving on to their next victim (yes, that's right, I totally just compared otherwise awesome Yelpists to date rapists because I disagree with their review....What?)  Let me attempt to remedy the situation:  One: do not fucking order Mexican breakfast from Easy.  This should be basic people. Do you see Mexicans in the kitchen? Does a single fucking thing about the establishment even fucking suggest a possibility of being able to deliver Mexican food in a reasonable manner? No. No such fucking thing exists. Jesus. Get ANY OTHER GODDAMN THING on the menu and it will be awesome. Children could have figured this out if you showed them a picture of the place...what is wrong with you?  Second: DO NOT GET THE MEXICAN ENTREES. Seriously. Stay the fuck away.  Third: Almost everything else is awesome, the steak and eggs is wicked ( I recommend just fucking biting the bullet and going for a rare steak with poached eggs: you KNOW you want to see those yolks soak into the blood like some sort of Yellow/Red abstract expressionist piece)  Fourth: seriously, like, everything else is awesome: the toast is brilliant (if you aren't starving toast soldiers is awesome), the roasted tomatoes are perfect, the west coast toast is the best seafood oriented benny in the city BY FAR (caviar and smoked salmon), the sausages are brilliant...fuck...its all so good. Seriously Yelp, realize you made a deeply idiotic menu choice, return to the scene of the crime, and make some apologies...      OK, last time but, fucking Mexican entrees at a diner themed around 60's Hollywood film...WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!!!?????"}
{"text":"To start off, I am so very embarrassed that I took my family from out of town here for brunch. We were a party of 7 and right from the get go the server was rude and basically annoyed that she had to serve us. My brother ordered a medium rare steak with eggs.  The steak was so over cooked he couldn't eat it.  Considering it cost $17 and was inedible, he sent it back. The server looked at him with disgust and finally said \"well OK, I will get you another\".  She walked away and didn't offer a whole new plate (instead she left him to eat around the charcoal steak). Then 15 minutes later the steak shows up!  So much for enjoying \"Steak and Eggs.\"  The rest of us had finished our meal and he got to finally eat his steak while we all waited.  We then sat for far too long for the bill with dirty plates in front of us and money on the table.  I don't need to tell you that all we wanted was to get out of there and never go back! The best part is that the server didn't mention that she put a gratuity on the bill for the crappy, rude service - which meant that we double-tipped them and had to go back after leaving to get our money back. I have worked as a server for many years, as has my brother, and I couldn't give this kind of terrible service to a table if I tried. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most underwhelming and overpriced ($65) brunch our family has ever had.  Food looks good, but is severely lacking in flavour, quantity, salt, and fat -- basically everything that makes breakfast fun.  The 16 dollar eggs and mediocre sides should cost 6.50, and the 6 dollar kids items should be taken off the menu -- two 2 inch diameter waffles with low fat whipped cream, or two eggs with a slice of bacon, do not deserve that price tag.  The steak looks like stewing beef chunks.  The 'salad' is just arugula with some oil drizzled on top.  The Mexican eggs are OK, but any Mexican place will do better.  The Caesar lacked alcohol, while the cranberry was watered down.  On top of this, three waitresses were completely overwhelmed with a dozen tables.  Truly a sight to behold watching them.  Ours forgot to both ask for and then bring drinks, didn't refill waters, and didn't even seem to comprehend that the (leathery) steak and eggs might require a steak knife.  We then had the pleasure of watching this clownery repeated with the table next to us.  Whoever runs this place needs to have a meal there once in a while."}
{"text":"I had the basic breakfast - 2 eggs over easy, home fries, toast (baguette slices) and coffee.  8.95 plus 2.95 for coffee. I think the baguette may have been from yesterday...it was a tad chewy.  2 of my friends had the Huevos Divorciados and enjoyed them very much.  I think my other two friends were happy with their meals.  The quality of my basic meal was very similar to those of the many \"greasy spoon/diners\" I've tried, (and I've tried a lot - see link to my breakfast list below), but was pricey in comparison.  Perhaps I should have tried one of their specialties, as described by others.  They were also having trouble with their heat (on a very cold day), so I'm still thawing out and my judgment might be affected.  Lastly, as a group of 5, they added a 15% gratuity to our checks.  (15% of the food including the tax.)  As one of my friends said, \"if it's on the bill, it's not a gratuity\"."}
{"text":"Having awoken New Years Day a little too late for Dim Sum I decided on a more local haunt for breakfast, that being Easy. I've eaten here a few times before and have been generally pleased enough with the food to make a return visit. Unfortunately my most recent visit was a rather expensive (for breakfast) excursion into blandness.  On weekends and holidays this place will be packed and you'll most likely end up in a small line up to get a table. Today, despite being New Year morning, I luckily (or perhaps not) had a minimal wait for a table. Having already tried the Easy Breakfast of standard eggs 'n bacon as well as the Huevos Divorcados I decided to entertain other parts of the menu. I chose the Breakfast Burrito with a side of chorizo sausage, expensive but I was hoping it would be well worth it. Along with with the meal I ordered a coffee, expensive again but can't complain much for bottomless illy coffee.  Long story short, virtually everything short of the guacamole was overcooked and lacking in flavor. The burrito had no kick, the home-fried potatoes were near burnt and the sausage tasted like chorizo flavored rubber. When you have to constantly reach for the salt and pepper shakers as well as the hot sauce to make a meal more edible it's a bad sign.  As for the service, in the past I've found it friendly and quick (kinda like my last relationship, har-har, but I digress...) Today I was served by what best could be described as a T-X model Terminator who was reprogrammed to be waitress. Incredibly fast and efficient (refilling my coffee whether I needed it or not), she did all the things a server should do in a timely manner except talk and smile.  The meal came out to about $20 before tip and you know I can think of a hundred places for breakfast I'd rather spend that kind of money at than for what I ate at Easy."}
{"text":"really really tasty. promptly seated just after 11 on a Saturday and food came out FAST. menu options are a plenty so I'm glad I took a peek on yelp in advance and went with the HUEVOS DIVORCIADOS - a soft corn tortilla topped with two runny eggs, two salsas (red & green), black beans, and served with a side of guacamole, ancho jam (YUM), three slices of baguette toast, and your choice of home fries or salad (for indecisive people like me, they offer 1/2 and 1/2 too).   the combination of flavours & textures = winning! spicy, buttery, salty, sour, creamy, crunchy, sweet...luckily there was toast to mop up all dat sawce so I could polish the plate clean -- like a lady ;)   space is small but it's clear that they use it wisely to deliver prompt service, and we never felt like we were bumping elbows nor needed to talk over our neighbours. prices are a tad more expensive than you'd find at a regular diner but I was satiated 'til evening so i'm a happy camper. can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Easy is pretty great. The food is really well done. \"West coast toast\" is an instant favorite. Last time I was there I had the steak and eggs. Their baguette toast can't be beat! My boyfriend had \"heuvos divorciados\" and hummed with delight throughout his entire meal. All their food is top notch and the coffee is magnificent. My only complaint off the menu are the smoothies. They're overly thick and not in the least refreshing.   The place is decked out in old movie posters (including \"Easy Rider\", where there place gets its name). Cool antiques dot the place, which no doubt come from the near by antique shops that line west Queen west.  That being said, I do have my issues with the place. Maybe because the restaurant is located in hipster central, the staff isn't hugely friendly. The first time I was there, the bald waiter hardly said a word to my boyfriend and I, and the second time we visited the waitress hardly came around. Multiple other people were serving us. I haven't ever tipped above the standard 15%. The place is pretty small, and if you go on a weekend, there is usually a line. Tables are closely packed, so this isn't the place to go so a nice relaxed brunch. They will serve you within 15 minutes and expect you to eat and leave.   Regardless, during the week in the early afternoon? This is the place to be! Easy is my favorite joint for breakfast food. Despite the odd unfriendly staff member, this place is pretty cool. If you don't mind the young and trendy vibe, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Guys- Milkshakes, mini waffles and Mexican breakfast. Honestly what more could you ask for?  I should just end my review there because that says it all.   My go to is always and forever will be the divorciados and the espresso milkshake. But I did try the banana power milkshake and I think that one might be slightly better. Just try both and see, I won't judge you.   But honestly Go here if you haven't. It's a bit on the expensive side but it is worth every nickel. I'd say every penny but they don't exist anymore."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch recently. It's been a while since I was last there and I had forgotten how good the food and atmosphere is. Yeah, it's busy and it can get a bit loud but I like that in a brunch place. I had the breakfast burrito with a side sour cream + green salsa and I pretty much licked my plate clean."}
{"text":"Well shit, maybe I should have read Yelp (Martin S.) before coming here, as we ordered TWO Mexican themed dishes: the breakfast burrito and the quesadilla. The burrito was straight up bad (0/5). The eggs were under-seasoned and the beans were straight out of the can. If you advertise re-fried beans, at least mash them up to make them look like somebody hasn't just popped open a can and poured the cold beans into the burrito with no care.   The quesadilla was a bit redeeming but still quite bad. The chorizo was okay, and there was some salt in the eggs.   On the plus side, the potatoes are actually very good here. And I had I read the reviews before coming here, maybe the other offerings would have been as good as the potatoes.  The $3 coffee is also pretty steep and kind of annoying.   With Parts and Labour open on Sundays, and a couple of other brunch places up the road on Roncevalles, don't think I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"Easy Restaurant is a very cool counterculture themed restaurant located on Queen Street West which pays homage to the 1969 classic film Easy Rider.  This is one of my favourite films and I was delighted when my friend surprised me with this brunch spot.  The décor is really fun to look at.  They have a lot of movie art posters, a large chalk board menu and cool kitsch items.  The menu is fairly diverse and I enjoyed my breakfast selection.  I have very high expectations for breakfast and Easy fell a little short of the mark in terms of taste and execution of the meal.  However, I was so distracted by all of the posters that it made up for it.  It is a nice joint for sure.  No, I mean it.  You've got a nice place.  You do your own thing in your own time. You should be proud Easy."}
{"text":"Can't speak for everyone else's experience, but I had a great experience here.  We came around 3pm on Sunday, so it wasn't too busy. Had the Huevos divorciados and mexican rider - the food was all delicious, and the accompanying baguette bread was fantastic!  Definitely am coming back."}
{"text":"Favourite breakfast place.... The huevos divorciados is amazing -we hardly ever get anything else!."}
{"text":"I pass by Easy Restaurant every single day, and always thought it was some tacky-diner-chain place that I really didn't pay much attention too. After getting a bit tired of my usual brunch spots, I looked to BlogTO and found they had recommended this place for brunch. I was so confused that I had to go right away. I almost don't want to write a review because it is SUCH a hidden gem and one of the better spots I've gone too in Toronto! They do have that classic diner vibe, but in a more hipster, retro, shabby-chic way. The menu is diner inspired with a Mexican twist, think breakfast burritos, quesadillas and their take on huevos (divorciados). My go-to brunch meal is eggs benedict, and did they ever deliver! Smoked salmon, hollandaise, dill, topped with black caviar, which I paired with a mimosa. I requested half salad, half hash-browns and they had no problem accommodating that. How could you go wrong? It was amazing, and perfectly decedent. The hot sauce they offer on the table is equally amazing and compliments the food perfectly given the appropriate amount of spice. The service was fast, and the restaurant wasn't too busy perhaps because of the given exterior. Honestly, don't even take my word for it- just go!"}
{"text":"Went here today. Very retro old school feel when you walk in.  You seat yourself and we had service instantly. The server was quick and  kind. The amount of food was very generous. I felt it lacked a little on flavour. I hear on weekends it's packed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live right down the street from this place & people were always like, \"Oh you should go to Easy Restaurant... it's really over priced but good food.\" The only true part of that statement was that it was wayyyy overpriced. $15 for a pretty terrible breakfast quesadilla. There was virtually no flavor & I bit into a lot of chicken fat, which I'm personally not a fan of & the thought of it left me gagging all day. The upside of that meal was the side salad, the only thing I enjoyed of both our meals. My boyfriend got the west coast toast, which was better than mine but still not that flavorful. Lastly, the home fries had absolutely NO flavor. Perhaps we chose the wrong items, but when leaving, we wished we had opted for the eggsmart next door. Oh yeah, and a cup of coffee will set you back THREE DOLLARS!!! Sorry if I sound bitter, but after spending so much, this place left us REALLY unsatisfied and really unimpressed. We definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast yesterday. The Huevos diverco (sic) were very nice. Lots of guacamole, beans and salsa along with the eggs and home fries. My girlfriend had the Eggs Benny which she said were also quite good. The service was a bit scattered and we waited awhile for our refills of coffee. Other then that it was quite good!"}
{"text":"Things I loved: the big open, breezy window; my mushroom omelette was so packed with mushrooms they were falling out; coffee was good, Screwdriver was good.  Lots of choice on the menu, especially for vegetarians which is rare.  The less than great:  only one poor server (who was doing a fantastic job given that she was the only person serving a TON of people - she still had a smile and did her best) which meant we felt bad about asking for more coffee or another drink - you should want to be spending more money, not feel like you're troubling someone; really weird sweetener choice (a Stevia product) for my coffee; overpriced slightly for area/quantity/quality."}
{"text":"This is one of my fave breakfast places. I have usually gone on new year's day (they are open!), and the wait has either been non-existent, or minimal. The food is great, the coffee is delicious, and the service is good. I like how you can split your sides (potato AND salad), because I am one of those people who is always like \"ugh, what do I do? I want both!\" The bread here is very yummy, and really stands out for me. They also have almond milk (what a rarity). Oh, and the gluten free waffles. Yum. I want them right now just thinking about them."}
{"text":"I decided to try Easy Restaurant for breakfast while I was visiting Toronto for OVO Fest in 2015 and I was blown away. The food, diner like atmosphere, and theme made this eatery quite enjoyable. I ordered the Huevos Divorciados and some coffee and was very pleased. Venturing to Easy Restaurant should one find themselves in Little Italy in TDot is a decision worth making. I look forward to returning next time I am in the city."}
{"text":"Easy Restaurant, in addition to having one of the best and most world famously original names in restaurateur history, also has a pretty damned good brunch. The servers are quite fast and friendly and are promptly ready to proffer an helpful suggestion or two. The eggs Benedict Florentine is just awesome! This is some of the most wonderfully made (probably - wishful thinking - on the spot to order) Hollandaise sauce you'll ever taste. They've also got a nicely filling yoghourt, fruit and granola selection. Excellent granola and such substantial Greek yoghourt. Order an alcoholic morning beverage if the mood strikes as well. Fancy a bourbon in your coffee; they've got that. Some bourbon in a milkshake; coming right up. Just don't ask for a mimosa because that sparkling liquid probably won't be champagne. This place does not suffer fools. Whilst you eat (or wait in line) you can look at interesting old vinyl records on display as well as old film posters from various different epochs in cinema. They've got the hood of what appears to be an old Grand AM perhaps mounted onto the wall so that's cool! Enjoy your brunch!"}
{"text":"I really wished that it had lived up to the review on BlogTO.  We visited yesterday for brunch and I ordered the Quesadilla while fiance had the Steak& Eggs.  Quesadilla was soggy and tasted like it had been cooked before it was left to cool in a steam room. The fries that came on the side was bearable but only with the help from Heinz (2/10).  The Steak&Egg was deplorable. Fiance took a bite and commented that the beef was as far out there from \"fresh\". The eggs were done right and the buttered baguette was decent without complaints (3/10).   Overall taste of both dishes were bland and definitely could use some kick to liven things up. We also recommend them adding in a fan or getting the AC to work.  Overall rating and this is for food alone (2.5/10)."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast and had their Huevos Divorciados  and Breakfast Burrito. There's things that really stood out and things that didn't live upto the hype.  The ambience was unique with its 1960s-1980s action movie pictures on the walls and the location is right near the lake at roncy and queen intersection. The waitress provided good service and the quality of food was 9/10.   However, the taste ? It was a downright 2 out of 10. I wanted to know what the taste of a Mexican breakfast place is like and it wasn't good. I had a hard time finishing my breakfast.  The mix of the two or atleast the way easy restaurant does it was not living upto its hype. The price was on the high end for really just some eggs and bread with some mexican dips.  If you want a unique experience and good quality food this is the place to come to but if you care about the taste and price sensitive think twice."}
{"text":"We sought out this place after reading that it was one of the best breakfast places in the city.  It was busy on the weekday afternoon that we went - the poor server was run off her feet by serving all alone.  Initial reaction of the place was that it was cute with a fun retro-trendy decor.  There were quite a few options on the menu for brunch (lots of south of the border items) but ultimately we both decided on the typical all-day breakfast.  Food came out in a reasonable amount of time and tasted good.  The home fries weren't my favorite but the eggs portion was plentiful and the bacon was pretty yummy.  The baguette bread was a nice substitute for typical toast.  Overall, I'm glad we checked out this place although truthfully I wouldn't rush back.  I feel the breakfast was fairly typical to most brunch places in Toronto.  What was not typical, although quite surprising, was the $4 charged to add cheese to the scrambled eggs - a hefty amount especially when we both couldn't really tell if it had actually been added.  As the rating says - 'A-OK'."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, amazing hot sauce, great service. Obsessed with the hot sauce. Had the breakfast quesadillas with brekkie potatoes. Delicious. The wait staff are adorable and friendly. Hope to visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"What an amazing find. This little kitchen certainly packs a punch. Vegan, veggie and meat lovers alike! We had the Huevos Diuorciados with shrooms and Easy Rider - both full of flavour! Smoothies look great too. Make this your Sunday destination."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Easy for brunch this past weekend.  I've lived 10 minutes away for over a year, and passed it countless times thinking \"oh right, I should go there sometime\".  And finally I did.  It's very vintage movie-fan inside, which makes sense since the restaurant is themed for Easy Rider.  We arrived after 10 and, surprisingly, were seated right away.  Lucky us!  We each ordered a smoothie, me the classic strawberry-banana, he the banana latte.  Both came out in huge, milkshake-sized glasses, which was much more than we were expecting.  Neither was amazing, but both were tasty enough.    I ordered the French toast croissant, he had the eggs benedict, and we ordered a side of chorizo (my favourite!).  The croissant was in thin slices, served with fresh berries and a fruit compote that was similar to a berry-applesauce, as well as real maple syrup on the side.  It had been cooked in a press and was delightfully crispy with great cinnamon flavour.  I really enjoyed it.  The bennie was quite good also, as were the potatoes that came with it.  The chorizo was a little disappointing though - I've had it many times, in many ways, and I've never had gristle in it before nor such big chunks of fat.  The fat was so big and obvious that I almost wanted to take my knife and take it out before I ate it.  The flavour was there, but those things took away from my enjoyment.  All in all, a solid choice for brunch, but I'd stay away from the chorizo here (it hurts to say it!)"}
{"text":"All day breakfast? Sign me up! Had brunch here a several weekends ago and I got the Eggs Florentine and a Mexican hot chocolate. The eggs were delicious and and the home fries were the thick cut square kind that I enjoy. My hot chocolate was nice until all the spice settled to the bottom. My friends had the Heuvos Divorciados and the West Coast Toast (which is a Benedict with smoked salmon and black caviar!!). It was really packed, but we never felt rushed. We had a lovely meal, and we enjoyed the retro and eclectic (to us) decor. Honestly, I won't be coming back simply because it is out of the way for me and I found the food to be typical, but I definitely think this is a great spot in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My favorite meal of the day has been and will always be breakfast.  My favorite food is Mexican .. combine the two and I'm a happy girl. I love that the menu at Easy is extensive, there's something for everyone. I ordered the chèvre/roasted pepper omelette and a side of beans. The portions are plentiful so be mindful when you order. The food was tasty and the coffee was good too (you would be surprised how many places can't even get coffee right !) I'm looking forward to going back to this dinner .. the food and decor are a winning combination"}
{"text":"Will never come up short. Fair prices, generous portions(mom's granola filled me up through lunch time) friendly service and a quick meal. Casual setting, easiest to bring cash."}
{"text":"Great hangover food, decently priced.   I got the eggs Benedict which was pretty effin good, and my friend got the breakfast burrito which was alright. There was a little bit of a line, but we were only two so we got seated fairly quickly.  Don't really have much else to say about this place, it is in Parkdale, so I wouldn't venture too far out of my way to eat here, and would probably only do so again if I were already in the area."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good, but also surprisingly expensive. I had the Mexican Rider, and while I'm not sure how down I am with paying $13 +tax and tip for a breakfast, it was quite good. Throw that in with a $6 Orange Juice, my wifes accompanying breakfast and coffee, and then tax and tip... Next thing we knew we were staring at a $50 bill which is more than I typically like for breakfast that didn't involve alcoholic drinks.  Something that seems really weird is how you can only order Breakfast Tacos during weekdays. I'd understand if they weren't a special price on a weekend, but to not offer them at all seems weird.  Aside from that, the service was perfectly adequate, so despite a bit of sticker shock on the bill, it was all in all \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"Four of us dined here last Saturday at J's suggestion. Great pick! We were in the mood for breakfast.  We were a bit confused about the menu. The Easy Rider Breakfast had an upgrade to Peameal bacon (which I'm not crazy about). As C put it, we wanted \"real bacon.\" Turned out that regular bacon comes with the Easy Rider Breakfast and it was ideal.   The only downside was that my eggs over medium were burned. :(  Service: 4 stars Ambiance: 4 stars Cuisine: 3 stars"}
{"text":"The decor is obviously something they've put a lot into. A lot of what is open to interpretation.  Orange juice was very pulpy, just the way I like it.  I ordered their house special, which has a name I can't pronounce. Two sunny eggs on a tortilla were unseasoned and underwhelming. The bagguette slices were nice and very useful to eat up all the wonderful guac and ancho jam. Black beans seemed like an afterthought and cluttered the plate. The \"homefries\" were baked quartered reds and undercooked to the point of almost being unedible. The green and red salsas were nothing to write home about.  It all came rather fast with the resto half full at the top of Thursday lunch hour.  I'd come back to try a dffierent dish."}
{"text":"One of the best cups of coffee I've had. Unique Mexican spin on breakfast items included in their regular fare. Great fresh squeezed OJ. Great service unique decor."}
{"text":"Why are so many restaurants in Parkdale closed for the summer? Our intention was to go to Mata but then found out it was closed (neither my friend nor I had the forethought to check their website and only checked yelp). So, with nowhere to go we looked up brunch spots in the area and Easy came up.   Walking in, we were delighted to see the retro décor and the diner like seating. Luckily there were a few tables available despite being prime brunch time and the place being nearly full.   We both got the bottomless coffee and ordered the breakfast quesadilla and burger to share. You can get both home-fries and salad on the side! Hooray! It's also notable that you can get either milk or almond milk with your coffee, free of charge! What a great place!   The breakfast quesadilla was delicious! We were able to get it with both chorizo and mushrooms/caramelized onions (even though the menu said chorizo OR mushrooms etc.) along with a salad (mixed greens) and home fries on the side. The burger was a lot smaller than I was expecting and tasted okay. The fries were crispy and excellent. Portion sizes were just right for our hungry bellies.     There's a small downsloping ramp leading to the washrooms. I nearly tripped on this as I wasn't anticipating the sudden drop (I'm also very clumsy). There might have been a sign but I didn't see one. Just a head's up!   Parking is easily found either on the street or at the green p lot just down the street (it's small, only 33 spots). They only accept cash and debit!"}
{"text":"Service, food, decor -- all pretty good.  The decor tries to evoke the year 1980, so far as I can tell, which is a nice break from the classic 1950s diner trope.  Unfortunately, I can't give this place more than three stars because the prices are ridiculous for what you get.  You can spend fully $4 less at any number of other places and eat just as well."}
{"text":"Crowded, claustrophobic, not enough staff, subsequent crap service. Food came surprisingly fast, but was saturated with grease. Overpriced for what it was. Not coming back. Don't recommend that you try it unless you enjoy waiting outside for a table for 15 minutes and paying more than you should."}
{"text":"Decent.  Too busy at peak times, over priced.  Seek out another diner if you want all day breakfast, etc...  The annoying 20 something females that say \"LIKE\" every four seconds and hipsters own this place.  It's yours."}
{"text":"Really good, fresh brunch items, nice service, and a very fast kitchen. Really interesting smoothie options and nice Illy coffee. Overall, a top notch weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! Slow service.  I hesitated to give this four stars because the service was so slow. We had read in advance that you might be left waiting for a coffee refill here, and as we watched our server play on her phone and eat her own lunch shortly after we had been delivered ours, we realized these rumours are indeed true. My boyfriend ended up going up to the bar to order more coffee, which eventually did come, but still, that makes everyone feel awkward.  That said, I had the breakfast burrito with a side salad and it was actually so, so good. Probably one of my fave tex-mex brunches I've had in the city. The burrito came baked in a whole wheat wrap with fried black beans (which didn't taste fried at all, a good thing as they weren't the mushy beans I was expecting), scrambled free-run eggs from mennonite farms, some cheese, cilantro and salsa packed inside, and an incredibly scrumptious side of guacamole. The portion was generous, but it wasn't ridiculous like other places. AKA I didn't leave feeling disgusting.  My boyfriend got the mexicanrider and he loved it, said it was almost like scrambled egg nachos. His bread came brushed with olive oil and was nice and crunchy.   The other reason this gets 4 stars is because hello, Easy Rider themed diner?! The old movie posters are amazing in here and it's such a cool kitschy place it's worth checking out for this reason alone.   I know I'll be back at Easy. It was a hard to decide what to order with so many delicious sounding options, but now that I've had the breakfast burrito, it will be hard to stray."}
{"text":"average . unfortunately thats all i can say about easy . its too bad, i wanted to love it .  maybe ive just been really lucky in the past, but this was the longest ive had to wait for brunch, even longer than hoofs or lady marmalade . so maybe expectations that were too high . and why dont they tell you that you need to put your name down ? we waited outside, since theres no space to do so inside, in the cold for a while then realized we needed to put our names down . boo !  i got the huevos divorciados because my friend was raving about it . it was my first time having mexican for breakfast . is this an actual authentic mexican breakfast dish ? i dont even know . but i do know it was .. good . only because there were some things i absolutely loved and some things i didnt so much and they, i guess, kinda offset each other . they have AMAZING guacamole . i wish there were more on the plate . their jelly jam stuff beside the guac was delicious as well . the salsas & the eggs were pretty average but what i really didnt like, however, was how soggy the torilla got . :( and re-fried beans, arent they suppose to be mashed ? how come i just had whole black beans ? :(   maybe mexican breakfast just isnt my thing . but i will be back to try their egg benny !"}
{"text":"Love it! Was hard to decide but I was happy with everything. This place is great if you can't have (or won't have) milk since when able, they substitute soy milk (such as their latte) and many of their smoothies are only made with ice and fruit anyway (on that note, I had the mango - made with banada, ice and mango nectar - and it only tasted like banana, so not for me). They even offered me a to-go cup when they say I was leaving half of my (generously proportioned) smoothie behind. I had the eggs benedict and everything was cooked to perfection. Eggs not too soggy, bacon crispy but not hard, potatoes were amazing. Note that many of the meals don't automatically come with toast unless it says so. Also split the mini waffles which was the PERFECT way to polish off the meal. Made with almond flour. So moist and rich, I was almost sad I didn't just get waffles as the main. Almost. We went at 11am on a Saturday and no wait, but there was a line when we left after 12. Huge menu, not loud at all and even the side-by-side seating isn't awkward. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Easy restaurant is great. I have been here a few times and the food never fails to impress. Big portions. Very good coffee! It's a little more expensive than other brunch places in the area but you get what you pay for. My favourite is heuvo divorciado ( their version of heuvo Rancheros). The ancho jam and toast are great together. The smoothies are very big too. It's best to share with someone.  This place is always packed on weekends but they recently opened a new location on King street, right around the corner. I came in today with a big group and got seated in the new location. The service is very fast especially we came with a group of 8.  It was nice to have a big table for us and there was only one server. It was less noisy than their main location so we could enjoy our food and have a chitchat.   If you're into the retro old school decor, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Steak and eggs? Really good here!  The toast is excellent, cross-cut baguette or something. Very buttery! Good butter!  Steak: Grass fed. Well cooked. Could have used a tad more salt but that's just me.  I ordered extra tomatoes and they gave me a LOT of extra grilled tomatoes, which was awesome!  They even have Xylitol as sweetener for the coffee!  I smelled someone's delicious chicken taco's on a table near me. I'll have to try those next time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The food is always fresh and yummy. The service is friendly and really great. The restaurant itself has decor that gets a conversation started. One of those places that you'd suggested to others and it's a \"go to\" brunch place. The only thing is we always have to get cash before and parking can sometimes be troublesome."}
{"text":"Amazingly , I found myself in this restaurant at 9:45 on a Sunday morning. It was already very busy (hence my companions with small baby insisting that we dine here early). It is a very cute space, and the liveliness (+ coffee) perked me up immediately.  We ordered two of the huevos divorciados  and an eggs benny with smoked salmon and black caviar. The food arrived quickly and seemed very fresh!   I know everyone does on about these huevos...but honestly? It just looks like a bit of a mess of beans, salsa. eggs and guacamole- the tortilla completely hidden- with three or four  pieces of toasted baguette thrown on top haphazardly.  Granted, I love all of these componants, but it kind of seemed like more of a mish-mash than a cohesive dish. That said, I enjoyed my smorgasbord.    Oh, and the ancho jam?? Amazing flavour. My new mission is to recreate it at home.   Brunch for three came to $60 (not including tip). Keep this in mind if you wander in expecting greasy-spoon prices!"}
{"text":"Its too expensive for what it is.. Actually everything was pretty tasty except I noted that the eggs were cooked with oil, not butter which for me is a bit of a turn off.."}
{"text":"Moved out of the neighbourhood 5 years ago and really missed this place! Was shopping on Roncie recently and decided on this old faithful for brunch. Was happy things hadn't changed and the Easy breakfast was as amazing as I'd remembered it. Everything was super fresh, cooked perfectly and serving size is very adequate - left me feeling full til dinner. I like that they will let you order half fries and half salad without charging extra. They also make a really good Caesar! Won't wait so long to go back."}
{"text":"I liked the diner feel with the large movie posters all over the walls.   I had the West Coast Toast (2 poached eggs, smoked salmon, red onions on English muffins, with hollandaise sauce, fresh dill and black caviar - with salad or home fries). Everything was delicious, but the home fries left something to be desired. I found them pretty bland for my taste.   Overall, it just wasn't memorable to me. It's a typical diner breakfast; but at $15, I wouldn't choose to come back-- too many other great options."}
{"text":"I love a good-sized breakfast.  Apparently, it is the American way, which is true.  Sometimes I do leave a restaurant in Canada still not quite satiated.  I am sure it is the right portion size but it's my American way.    Here, the sizes are just right for me.  And unlike some places that believe portion size is above taste, this place does well in both categories.  I believe I had the Huevos Rancheros and they were perfect.  They are not like the huevos I have had in hometown of Houston, but they were perfect.  Everything was there from the guacamole, beans to lime and cilantro.    And the coffee is good here.  Maybe it is not such a rarity to find good coffee at a breakfast spot.  This is definitely a stop when I make it out to Queen West."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast in Parkdale.    We had the restaurant specialty, the heuvos divorciados (or something).  Eggs on beans and tortillas with ancho salsa and guacamole.  These were even better than they sound.  And very filling.   We also had their West Coast Toast.  Wow!  Easy Restaurant 's take on eggs benedict.  Poached eggs on an english muffin topped with smoked salmon and caviar, as well as a healthy dose of hollandaise.  Unforgettable as French Montana would say.   To end the affair we had their mini waffles which cone with real maple syrup, whipped cream, and a berry compote.   Yessssss!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive, but the food is fantastic and worth it. Fresh OJ and the best Mexican inspired breakfast dishes. Try the Huevos Rancheros."}
{"text":"I visited Easy restaurant because it's one of the few brunch spots in Toronto with gluten free bread. After going g-free for medical reasons, I've missed being able to without much go to a greasy spoon and have almost anything I wanted on the menu. Although even Hero Burger & South Street Burger Company now offer g-free buns, most greasy spoons don't have gluten free bread or at the least buckwheat pancakes. I found the space in Easy restaurant small but tastefully decorated. My ham and cheese omelette came quickly and did not disappoint. The caramelized onions in the omelette enhance the flavour. I don't know what brand of gluten free sourdough bread was used, but it was soft and delicious and most likely a high end brand. My brunch partner was equally impressed with her vegetarian omelette and toast. I found service to be good but not great, only because the server didn't ask if the food was ok. However, it was understandable given how busy it was on a Sunday afternoon. Overall I would definitely return to Easy restaurant and maybe next time try to gluten free waffles."}
{"text":"I spent several days in the area and tried several breakfast spots. Easy was easily the best in the area (see what I did there..?).  Had the Huevos Divorciados and was not disappointed. The potatoes were to die for. So much better than another restaurant's frites that everyone was on about here. I don't want deep fried potatoes with my breaky. AND they offer you salad or potatoes or 50/50. I took the split in an effort to appear health conscious, but would go full potato next time.   Tasty and fresh. I didn't find it overpriced for the quality. I don't mind paying a more for great food."}
{"text":"I really want to like this location - it's much closer to home than the one on Queen.  However, after having been here a few times for breakfast (maybe 5 times) we've had less than stellar service on more than one occasion and the food has sometimes been off.  The last time we were here, the potatoes were over-seasoned.  It felt like someone had dropped the bottle of salt onto our potatoes.  This morning my side salad was mostly wilted - definitely past its best before date.  In fact I'm not sure you can call a handful of spring mix \"salad\" - it really felt like whoever put it on the plate just took an old box of spring mix from the back of the fridge, grabbed a handful of it and put it on my plate.  No dressing, nothing else.  It was actually pretty gross, I picked out what was edible and left the rest.  Freshness aside my biggest gripe about this location is that the staff seems more interested in talking to each other than actually serving their customers.  I would've complained about the wilted spring mix this morning if the server had come by to check up on us... but no one actually seemed interested in seeing how our meal was, let alone caring to check if we wanted coffee refills.  This is the second time we've been here and been pretty much ignored by staff once we've gotten our food.  They just stand around the bar area chatting with each other.  The first time we noticed this happening was when we were here a few months back.  I'd asked the waitress for jam and she said she'd be right back with it... then she went to the bar area and started talking to her co-workers.  I asked again 5 minutes later (maybe she'd forgotten?), got the same response... and still no jam... After asking a 3rd time I just gave up on the idea that I might get jam to go with my toast.  Today our waiter was more interested in reading his newspaper than checking to see if our coffees needed refilling.  I eventually got one of the waiters attention by waving at them to get a refill of coffee (they were again all huddled around the bar talking to each other.)  Overall it's a big meh for me.  I'd rather just go back to the one on Queen.  It seems like when this place opened up there were a lot more people coming here - ie line-ups out the door - and last few times we've been there are empty tables.  Now I can understand why - 13$ for your breakfast main should include some kind of service and definitely a better side salad than a well-past-its-prime-ready-for-the-green-bin wilted spring mix with nothing on it."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs florentine with grapefruit juice. The eggs were done well and the side of potatoes was delicious. However, I was disappointed with the juice since it was very bitter. The service was very friendly and welcoming which is why I would love to come back here again. The portions were decent as well."}
{"text":"This place can get busy on the weekends, so expect a bit of wait - but it's totally worth it..  I ordered the STEAK DIVORCIADOS and it was delicious! I will be returning to EASY to try their other dishes, but I may be tempted to order the same thing again...  Note: They only accept debit and cash payments"}
{"text":"What I would describe as a 'hipster' type place, relaxed casual atmosphere, steady flow of people and great brunch! I had the tacos w chorizo as recommended by our awesome waiter. Delicious and we'll be coming back 100%!"}
{"text":"The last time I came here for brunch, it was a Sunday afternoon around 3pm. The place was relatively empty but despite this, the service was slow.   I ordered an eggs benny and was surprised when the egg came out seriously under-cooked. The white was still runny as hell--EWW. Definitely not what you'd expect from a simple eggs benny.   I asked for a new egg and the waitress was nice about it, but it then took a while for the new poached egg to come out.  It's a shame because I like the decor of this place and they have interesting menu offerings; the food just didn't stack up."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed.  I suggest going in small groups and as early as you can stomach getting up, or make reservations; otherwise prepare to bring your patience and a granola bar.    The Huevos Divorcados is a dish that is a take one Huevos Rancheros but more refined; you will walk away feeling satisfied and no need of a nap.  The salad that accompanies it really keeps it light and filling but not gutt busting full.    The West Coast Toast is a dish is just as delicious as the one mentioned above however, I did the mistake of ordering their Peanut Butter Power Smoothie; which is a meal within itself.  All dishes I have tired has yet to dissapoint me so am a definite fan and will be coming back during the weekday to try their breakfast tacos.  I urge you to go and check them out, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Easy is one of those restaurants that when you walk in you expect to find  a table of two ladies chatting about the restaurant's energy and the ways in which it is affecting their moon cycles and, inevitably, you do.  But all that lunar magic and inner bliss aside, Easy is also a divey kind of spot whose strange fascination with 70's Car Flicks makes an odd mix for a joint that serves Eggs Benny and Breakfast Burritos.  Anyway, I know the place is good because I can keep my food down even while hearing the neighbouring ladies chat about their vulvae.  If you prefer cleanliness to sucking down an amazing smoothie then chasing it with a burrito, Easy is not your restaurant of choice.  The menus suffer from fossilized ketchup and the tables could use a pressurized cleaning (or two)."}
{"text":"Probably the best little joint for brunch! Too bad they don't take reservations, otherwise it would have been 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love this place - I've reviewed it on the Queen St location page before. I'm only giving it a 3 star review however because i just had my first negative experience here. I ordered my favourite breakfast - the Toast Soldiers - complete with a toy soldier on your plate!!! It's simple but meets my every breakfast need - 2 soft boiled eggs, salad, homefries and a decent serving of fruit along with beautiful buttery french loaf for dipping in the eggs. I've replicated it at home more than once! This last time unfortunately my soft boiled eggs were not boiled long enough - I sent them back and they replaced them with 2 even less cooked eggs. At which point I was no longer in the mood for eggs and I'd already eaten the rest of my breakfast. They didn't charge me for my meal and promised to do better next time. I'll be back, I do really love the decor and the vibe of Easy. The menu has a ton of options for a vegetarian with all the delicious Mexican fare and lots of options for those wanting more lunch than brunch. I look forward to my next visit where they may be able to bump back up to four stars."}
{"text":"Now THIS is brunch!!! This review applies to both locations - the Queen and Roncy original and the new location on College at Crawford. Same menu, same decor, same experience.  Easy is always packed, I've frequented it for years and that's always been the case. But it's brunch so if you wait 5-10 minutes you're bound to get a seat. The new location is still getting its groove in terms of logistics, the tables are too close together and it's a small space on College that they are trying to make the best use of - they're not quite there. There is a small patio as well.   The food is delicious - I'm partial to the Toast Soldiers - reminds me of being a kid but they serve it with tasty salad and fruit to make me feel grown up too - but not too grown up, a plastic toy soldier comes on the plate to watch over my soft boiled eggs.  My bf prefers lox and hollandaise in his breakfast and he was very happy with his choice. Everything tastes fresh and they also buy locally and eco-friendly. Always wins points with me!  The caesars are tasty if you're looking for a morning after beverage with your breakfast. The coffee is good - from a quality coffee machine. The smoothies are creamy and sweet and they have take away containers if you're on the run with your coffee or smoothie.  Price is right - average $20 brunch and totally worth it. I wish this place was a secret but alas, the secrets out - so see you there!"}
{"text":"I would definitely come back to this place. My boyfriend and I came here a couple weekends ago. He ordered the Eggs Benediction,  with back bacon on English muffins,  with garden salad, home fries and a grapefruit slice. The home fries were subpar.   I ordered the huevos divorciados, two sunny side up eggs, with salsa Verde and regular red salsa, with a small scoop of guacamole, Ancho chili jelly, slices of baguette.... delicious.  we also ordered OJ. Pretty good.  Would like to come back for other menu items."}
{"text":"I had an early lunch today at Easy Restaurant.  Easy is know for their breakfast and I was torn between having breakfast or lunch ... and went with lunch.  I ordered the grass fed burger (but without the cheese, onions or peppers).  There were no condiments for the burger so I used what I'm assuming was chipotle mayo on it.  It was a good burger.  The fries were good too.  Jason was the server and he was friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"Menu is creative, food is good, coffee is great. The service isn't overly fantastic but the food + menu combo make up for it."}
{"text":"We go there for our team breakfast almost a month. We really love their food and services! We keep going for once a month!"}
{"text":"So maybe, before she gets down to devouring her food she at least communicate to whomever is taking over that there are patrons, that have been standing, and now sitting at a dirty table with absolutely no service. So then the waitress disappears into the kitchen, and the waitress number one tosses her napkin on her plate, comes to our tables, doesn't say anything and slams the cutlery and menus in the center of the table and walks away. I am not sure if this is regular service at this tacky place, but I've never experienced that before. I wanted to walk out, but for the sake of all the effort we got to just get some service, I thought the food better be worth it and we've come too far by this point. So we order, I ordered the Breakfast Quesadilla, my friends order the Belgian Mini Waffles and the West Coast Toast, and coffees and water. My friends are splitting the West Coast Toast and the Belgian Waffles, so they ask if they can bringout the West Coast Toast first, and then the Belgian Waffles, the waitress says sure, all seems okay. We end up getting the West Coast Toast and Belgian Waffles together, as in at the same time. The waitress says, she put in the order after, but \"I guess they cook fast\". Okay, smart ass waitress, that why you put in the order AFTER the person is done eating the meal or almost done or at least let the cook know, if you don't feel like doing that. My quesadilla was unimpressive, too much and kind of dry, I ended up ordering a side of guacamole to go with it, the home fries are terrible, but I decide to not complicate my life and just don't eat them, and the \"salad\" that comes with all this is wilted and looks old. At this point I am just thinking about being somewhere else. We all tried making conversation but it all came back to the terrible and hostile service. I tried to enjoy my food, after all of that, this became an impossible task. My friend dug into her Belgian Waffles which she told me were amazing and she always gets them, she spoke too soon, they were half raw dough inside (they cook fast huh?). So we feel bad complaining but, we can't eat it since the dough is raw inside. We call over the waitress, who never asked us how the food was or never asked to refill coffees or water. My friend tells her how she gets the Belgian Waffles every week, and normally they are fully baked inside, the dough is raw and doesn't seem right, and open the Belgian Waffle for the waitress to see, our clever waitress responds with \"well they used the same dough as last time\". I have no words. Telling me that is the equivalent of me telling you my steak is not cooked properly and you responding, well \"we used the same recipe\".  So she asks us if we want to send them back? Of course, I didn't tell you about the raw dough so you could watch me as I eat it. Duhh. So she comes back with the difference, there were 5, two were cut in half, one was eaten, and she brings us back 3 waffles, we decide to just have the damn waffles and pay and leave. We open it, the waffles are hot, cut into it, and the dough is still raw, surprise! Microwaving the waffle wont automatically cook it. So they didn't make another one, they just reheated the other ones. Such a joke. We left zero tip. I have never left Zero tip. In conclusion, in case you are too lazy to read my review. The service is way too poor to even excuse coming here for the food. It's \"meh\" quality at best. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. I think a monkey might give you better service than the servers here."}
{"text":"Easy is a fairly average brunch spot, good but I didn't find it to be anything special. If I lived in the area I could see myself eating here on occasion, but I don't think it's worth going out of your way.  At 10:30 on a Saturday morning there was no line for Brunch. The decor is plain; neither sterile nor homey. Service was good. Prices are reasonable. This is a kid friendly restaurant. Believe it or not, I actually enjoy kids in a place like this -- reminds me of home -- but I can see how some might not.  The Mango Smoothie was an awesome deal at $4.50 for a HUGE glass. It was mango and banana, which meant it tasted entirely like banana since banana has a tendency of overpowering anything it's served with. I dig banana so no big deal, but worth mentioning for those that aren't banana fans.  The Eggs Florentine ($10.50) was good. The Hollandaise sauce was good and the eggs were decently cooked, though they could have been a little more runny. The Chevre & Pepper Egg-White Omelette ($11.50) was excellent. Nice, creamy goat cheese, roasted red peppers, and basil; a perfect combination. I also prefer my omelettes with egg whites since it's a little lighter and the egg doesn't overpower the filling.  Both mains came with either homefries or salad. Neither impressed me all that much. The homefries were seasoned well and could have been excellent, but were slightly undercooked. The salad was mixed greens with a vinegrette dressing. Unfortunately, some of the greens had gone a little bad and had that gross slimy texture. I'm usually not squeamish about food, but I just can't stand slimy greens!"}
{"text":"VIBE  I always end up at Easy for two reasons:  1. After a race.  2. After a hangover.   Guess which one happens more often? I love that this old standby has the old movie theme from the old classic, Easy Rider. There are tons of old movie posters along the wall. This place is bustling but at a relaxed pace, if that makes sense. So it's crowded but you're not rushed. Tables are a bit too close together so you feel a wee fenced in. Service is excellent.   I ATE  The West Coast Toast - 2 poached eggs, smoked salmon, red onions on English muffins, with hollandaise sauce, fresh dill and black caviar - with salad or homefries. The dill and caviar really give the eggs benny that kick that you need but it's balanced with the salmon.  You can get the salad AND the homefries split on the side but I would go with the homefries. There are perfectly spiced. The \"salad\" is a bunch of lettuce from a box. Come on! There is NOTHING on the lettuce either. Not even dressing!  Orange juice is fresh and delish.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I easily find myself here after a hangover. That is not a bad thing."}
{"text":"This is the newly-opened sister-restaurant to \"Easy\" in Parkdale.  I had heard good things about the original location, so I was excited to learn they brought the popular brunch spot to my 'hood in Little Italy. Went on a Sunday morning, and promptly seated ourselves at a table.  Place wasn't overly busy which was a nice surprise considering I've witnessed some long lineups outside this spot in the past couple weeks.  I ordered the French Toast Croissant.  Presentation was nice, and it was an interesting & unique take on the common breakfast option, BUT.....in taste and portion size, it fell flat.  Nothing about it really jumped out at me.  The Peanut Power Smoothie was delicious though, and filling, which made up for the hunger left behind by the french toast. My partner-in-crime ordered herself the Breakfast Quesadilla.  She found it overly salty and couldn't bring herself to finish it.  I'm unsure if the hype surrounding Easy raised my expectations too high, but I was a little let down.   I really wanted to be \"Wowed\"!  Instead, I was \"meh'd\"  Left having paid $47 after tax/tip for our two dishes, a smoothie, and coffees (CASH AND DEBIT ONLY!).  Given the other options close by (saving grace), I'm not too certain I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"i've tried a few mexican places by mexicans, but i'm not an expert on mexican food.  however, the huevos divorciados tasted good to me - nice strong flavors that hit the spot.  the coffee, which i drank a lot of, was also good.  i suppose the cost is high, but i can understand why.  the place was packed even on a weekday."}
{"text":"It's always a risk trying a new breakfast place - especially one that has gluten free items on the regular menu (not as substitutions). I ordered the mini Belgium waffles and a side of fruit (the fruit was literally a few berries and 2 slices of grapefruit + 3 slices of honeydew and cost $5.95). The waffles tasted great and were most definitely made with gluten free flour. Unfortunately I was violently ill about 20 minutes after eating (sounds fast but it's my standard \"getting glutened\" alarm). I know when I've been glutened - the results are always the same. So I don't know whether it was accidental, cross contamination, or just having \"sort of\" gluten free items assuming most people are just doing it by choice, but it happened. For the celiacs and those with gluten intolerance, avoid this place and go somewhere else. The rest of the table enjoyed their food - eggs Benedict and some Mexican-themed breakfast dish. The portions are fairly small and the prices are high."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I went there a while back but forgot to post a review. If you are looking for a very tasty breakfast spot, this is it! Be prepared to wait in line on the weekend (maybe up to 30 mins!) but it is worth the wait. The huevos divorciados (The house speciality: 2 sunny eggs on a corn tortilla with spicy green & red salsa, re-fried black beans with side guacamole, ancho jam, toasted baguette - with salad or homefries) is definitely what I would recommend. What makes this dish so delicious is the ancho jam (peppery and sweet) along with the toasted baguette (very fresh). If you are in the neighbourhood, pop into Easy Restaurant: you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Toast. Soldiers.  Carmen, the greatest server ever to walk the face of my breakfast, was a major hilight of eating here after a disappointing attempt to brunch at Saving Grace.  Kat and I were on one of our patented \"I work at home\" weekday brunch adventures and we ended up at Easy after 2 hours worth of non errand related stops on the west side. I was legitimately fading into hangry (hungry + angry, tm Beth L 2001) status and after grabbing a red mocha at Ella's Uncle (which took forever but was worth the wait) we ended up at here.  The best: - Carmen.  Carman?  However it's spelled... she turned my hangry into happy within 2 minutes of arrival with her surly hipster attitude towards the other patrons.  I want to be friends with her and hew new lighthouse tattoo.  She said that I couldn't have freshly squeezed grapefruit juice because the bastards at the other table took it all but brought me OJ instead.   The second best: - Toast soldiers came with a SOLDIER that had camouflaged  himself with my hashbrowns.  Amazing.  I have to say, Carmen must be my favorite server ever to top a toy soldier coming with my food.  That's practically un-toppable,  The good; - Everything was good.  I had an amazing time at Easy and I enjoyed my food a lot. - I had toast soldiers. Yes, TOAST SOLDIERS. It is my dream breakfast.  It comes with soft boiled eggs (which I of course substituted for soft poached), hashbrowns, fruit and toast cut up into strips for dipping.  - We brought our coffees in from another place (I wouldn't normally do this but it was just bad timing that I still had half a coffee left when we arrived here) and they were totally cool about it - no questions, no problems. - The people across the aisle from me and I got to chatting about the smoothies and they were heartily recommended  The bad: - This place is in parkdale.  That's really far from my house. - Toast Soldiers does not come with bacon.  You can add it, but I wish it came with it. - I bet there is a line on the weekend and I bet it's a long line.  Would I ever go here again? Yes I would.  But not if there was a line.  Maybe if the line was short line and I saw Carmen.  I'm going to strive for weekdays only."}
{"text":"Had the Huevos Divorciados this morning, which made for a delicious brunch. I enjoy saucy dishes and this one delivered - green salsa, red salsa, ancho jam, guacamole, and egg yolks plus a healthy dose of Valentina hot sauce on top! The baguette bread that came with the dish was also great - perfect for sopping up all that sauce :-) My only complaint was the homefries - too potato-y for my taste, not crispy enough.   Apart from the food and the good coffee, I found the service to be ok. We were seated right away and got our coffees quickly. The service was attentive and our food arrived within 15 minutes of ordering. It took a while to clear our table and get the bill, but it wasn't a big deal.  TLDR; yummy food, good service, will go back"}
{"text":"Pretty standard, no-nonsense breakfast. The \"Easy Breakfast\" is, well, easy; eggs, homefries, bacon, and a piece of grapefruit.  I was not a big fan of my bacon being served in a tangled clump, but my breakfast mate liked it that crispy as many restaurants serve bacon a little less so.  Can't really give a bad review as it's called the Easy Restaurant. It's pretty much a straight up pseudo-greasy spoon place with old posters of people on motorcycles from the 1950s. I've been in 101 places just like this, but the other places usually try a little harder to be unique with a whimsical menu. For example Floyd's Diner in Victoria BC has the \"Mahoney\" which consists of a dish dreamed up by the kitchen. Most of the time it's gross but when the bill comes you get to flip a coin for it, double or nothing. A win means you don't pay the bill, a loss means you pay double. That kept me coming back to Floyd's for years in my college days.  Oh, wait, this is a review about the Easy Restaurant. Eh, right... well they have breakfast. So, y'know, that's good."}
{"text":"I love this place!  One of my fav brunch spots.  I love to make my breakfast at home but when I do head out this is where I love to go.  The Breakfast Burrito is delicious.  I find the Huevos to be a bit too greasy...but the Burrito is delicious.  The portions are huge so I'd recommend to go with salad instead of homefries or you will feel like you need a taxi ride home."}
{"text":"Easy like Sunday morning (brunch)! Not as easy on the wallet though!   So many options, it was hard to choose what to order: I settled on the vegetarian tostadas and  as Yelp puts it, it was A-OK, but I've had better at other establishments. - good sized portion of mushroom/cheese/tomato  and beans over tortillas, topped with guac and a side of baguette and home fries. I found the tortillas to be a bit stale and the home fries bland, but everything else was good. I have to say, the guac was superb.   Would I come here again? Probably, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"We've lived in the West end for way too many years to not have tried Easy for brunch!  Arrived on a soggy Sunday morning around 10:30am and there were a few available tables left.  We lucked out with a booth for 3.  Ordered brunch dishes - Huevos Divorciados ($14.95), Mexican Rider ($13.95) and some coffees ($2.95).  I had planned to share my entrée with our daughter until I realized that the scrambled eggs included spicy chorizo and jalapeno peppers.  Decided to order her own mini-waffles ($5.95).  Service was pretty great...our food came up super fast after ordering.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Mexican Rider as it was pretty spicy and I'm a wimp when it comes to that.  I found the hash browns too large and undercooked.  Mini-waffles were good though - very dense but fresh and hot.  Probably won't be one of our regular brunch spots but at least I can take my bookmark off this West side joint."}
{"text":"Met up with friends for an 11am brunch on a Sunday; there were 5 of us, so we expected a wait.  After all, it is Sunday brunch in Toronto!    The hostess indicated that it would be a 15-20 minute wait, and invited us to have a seat at the bar and get caffeine.  Despite being a tea drinker, I love lattes with brunch; they have almond milk for us lactose-intollerant folks - win!  The drinks came quick! They were all out of honey (humph!) but there was some brown sugar, so all was not lost.  I took one sip of my latte and recoiled in disgust.  A properly pulled espresso tastes almost sweet, and one of my pet peeves is an espresso-based drink that tastes bitter.   I've learnt not to complain (except for at Starbucks) because a badly trained barista will not be able to redo the drink properly.  Docked one star for that.  Our table was ready in less than 10 minutes and the server came by quickly.   I was intrigued by the huevos divorciados and the anchovy sauce it came with, and decided to make it that day's brunch.  Great idea!  Everyone's food came out a reasonable time later (I always appreciate it when restaurants bring an entire group's meal at the same time!) and I was delighted by my plate.  The baguette was fresh, toasted to perfection and really tasty.  Guac was great and the mix of tortilla, eggs and refried beans was just divine!  I got a side of salad (instead of potatoes) and got the usual mix of spring greens with a bias towards arugula.  As for the much anticipated anchovy sauce - it was a tad too sweet for me.    I enjoyed my meal immensely, as did the rest of the group (two Easy Streets, one West Side Toast and one Toast Soldiers), although I do wish they had brought out water for the table when we first sat down.  I had to ask for it, and it was promptly provided (but the server didn't think to ask the rest of the table if they wanted any) and did not automatically.  Still, I enjoyed the meal so much that I didn't dock a second star.  Overall, good food and nice enough ambiance; I'll go back, but I'll get tea instead of a latte!  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"A pretty typical brunch spot; crowded, busy, a bit dingy (but in a good way). I came here with 5 guys and we had to cram ourselves around a small table by the window, which was probably only meant to fit like, 4 people at most.   Whenever I go out for brunch, I always end up getting some variation of Huevos Rancheros, so obviously I opted for the much-lauded Huevos Divorciados with homefries at Easy. The food was good, and servings were generous; I enjoyed the combination of salsas and the ancho jam. Unfortunately the homefries were pretty tasteless and came swimming in a pool of oil, so I pawned them off on the guys who happily gobbled them down (no homefry left behind!). With an Illy coffee, my cut of the bill came to $20 even.   Prices here seem a bit high to me for the quality of the food -- a Vegetarian Tostada costs $15.95. Really? Also, service is pretty efficient, but doesn't seem to be the friendliest; then again I don't usually expect too much from servers who are probably turning tables all morning long. A decent spot for brunch, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Went there since my wife wanted breakfast. Her mushroom omelet was okay but got a bland salad on the side. I ordered the basic breakfast, cannot complain about the eggs but the fries were disgusting, oily and almost uncooked in the middle.  I give it a two star since the service was good until I saw a boorish patron come to pay his check. He walked over blow his nose and left his tissue on the table next to the cash register. The waitress picked up his tissue with her bare hand and proceed to serve. I told her that she should wash her hands. She just smiled and ignored the hand wash. I wonder how hygienic the kitchen is????  Never go there again. Bad training and lack of common sense."}
{"text":"Visited Easy for the first time this morning with Kat F. Though it was pretty busy we got a table for two in no time. My white-omelette with chevre gets a solid thumbs up. They serve Illy cappucinos as well which is a plus. Apparently there is extra seating on the King street side.  Obligatory Title Pun: EASY to love this West End brunch joint.  Menu Readability: Clean, well-spaced, laminated ledger.  Big but not road-map big.  I approve.  Need to mention: the tables are way too close together.  Also, we had a hell of a time freeing the salt shaker from it's carriage. (We couldn't and didn't.)  What this place teaches me about myself: Maybe Hollandaise sauce is worth trying."}
{"text":"It's a small diner- throwback to the 60's. If you get there at the wrong time be prepared to wait. The food is solid. Got the Huevoes Divorciado (spelling?- sorry), good but nothing special, a little soupy. They make a solid Caesar .  The waitress was ok, but not very attentive, didn't bring water or check on us after we got our food and when I put the credit card down, she looked at me like I was lost, as apparently you pay up at the register- never been here I don't know, she could of mentioned it when she put the bill down.  Good food, mild service. 'Meh' kind of place. Lots of other places in the city to try before I come back here."}
{"text":"The staff here are nice and I sort of like the Huevos Divorciados (basically Huevos Rancheros, and I have no idea what this play on words is referencing).  HOWEVER: prices at this place are at high end for a greasy spoon: Huevos are $12,95, and coffee adds another $3.00.  So we're talking the better part of $20 with tax & tip.   Now, at that price you expect exceptional coffee; here they apparently use Illy (a premium brand) but the coffee often has that dirty taste you get from not cleaning the pot/machine properly.  Inexcusable when you can get a made to order Americano at Cherry Bomb for the same price.   On my most recent visit the hash browns had that dessicated quality of something that had been resting at the side of a grill for an hour or more; tasted of dirty cooking oil.  The side salad was a limp handful of field greens, seemingly not dressed.  Worst of all, there was a long strand of hair entwined in my eggs.  Revolting.  They replaced the meal, offering a sheepish, 'Sh*t happens' by way of explanation, and knocked a % of the bill.  (Note to Easy: hair nets for the cooking staff would mitigate the risk of sh*t happening) Not the worst food in Toronto, but I left today, as I have in the past, thinking there was a mismatch between price and quality here.  A tastier, healthier, and more carefully prepared brunch can be had at say Fresh or Calico Cafe for less money."}
{"text":"Easy does it again! (ha...I didn't mean to make a pun)  I decided to branch out and try the Eggs Benedict at Easy this morning and I am happy to say the dish makes my list of best eggs benny in the city. I ordered the Eggs Florentine (as I always do for brunch) and the spinach was perfectly blanched and not at all soggy as it often can be in an Eggs Florentine. The eggs were perfectly poached and there was just enough hollandaise - not so much that it gives you a case of the sh*ts the next day, but not so little that you can't taste it at all.  My absolute favourite part of today's brunch was the homefries. I'm going to start a homefries list solely based on Easy's homefries - they are SO GOOD. Roasted potatoes that are drenched in a tangy, seasoned spice rub that have a bit of a curry twist and the subtlest flecks of coriander on them. Mighty tasty."}
{"text":"Easy Restaurant is a great place with a very cool atmosphere, the food is really good and the coke comes in glass bottles! :)"}
{"text":"I'm upset, and for all the wrong reasons.  being a weekly rider of the 501 queen, and often times being short turned at roncy, I've found myself looking at all the nifty stores in the area. I always looked at this restaurant and said to myself \"man, I really gotta try this place, sooner then later\" I finally went, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I was the first customer of the day, literally the first customer waiting outside for the doors to open. upon coming into this restaurant it felt like going into a time warp, like being displaced into the late 80's early 90's, not a bad feeling, very nostalgic and for all the right reasons, it felt cliché at times, but very comfortable. I was told right away to pick a seat, which I did and I was brought a menu, I couldn't help but notice the pricing...and for breakfast it just seemed really really expensive. $15 or so for a decent sized meal, 7 bucks for a milkshake, and 2-5 bucks for extra sides. I looked over the menu, and I was torn between a couple of different items but I decided on an omelette(du fromage!...and other toppings), with two sides(peameal bacon and sausage). I sat and drank my water with ice, and I felt like I was being a bit of a pain, but I forgot to tell the server that I wanted no cilantro on my omelette(just incase) the server gave me a facial expression after words that I was being a pain, which made me feel worse. when my food came I was brought three plates one was my omelette with hash browns and bread, about six pieces of peameal bacon, and one sausage split in half. the reason why I'm bringing this up, the menu doesn't tell you it's one sausage split in half for $4.50 and six pieces of peameal bacon for $3.50. I felt burned...really badly. I consumed my sides without so much as a complaint. I worked on the hashbrowns, which I have had better, but given the circumstance, it was good. I moved onto my final piece of food which was the omelette, I took the first magical(or so I thought) bite and all I could taste was oil...I even went so far as to lift up the omelette and under it was just a big sloppy mess of oil. it tasted ok, once you got past the oil, I seriously wondered at the time of eating my food, as I am wondering right now, if the reason there was that much oil was because I was the first person in? or what? my plates were taken quickly as I continued on my third glass of water. I was in the zone with my music blasting in my ears and my food settling in my stomach. without any warning what so ever I was given the receipt...now I take this from the standpoint a huge negative, my opinion wasn't asked how the food was, nor was I asked if I wanted anything further...which to be honest I found to be pretty disrespectful. to paint the scene a little bit further, there were other customers that were treated in about the same fashion as I was, BUT, when three ladies came in, the server actually sat down with them, had a conversation with them, etc etc etc. I paid my bill and I left.   I really wish I could rate this \"easy restaurant\" higher, but I feel after being repeatedly punched in the face with some of the worst customer service, my hopes for an amazing breakfast were absolutely crushed. I've vowed after this experience never to come back...and to take it a step further, eggsmart is right next door, where I have had OUTSTANDING service, at every location, and appreciates me as a customer.   easy restaurant...easy on the customer service, easy on the food portions, not so easy on the wallet.   WILL NEVER COME BACK."}
{"text":"There are a lot of breakfast places in the area, but we decided to try out Easy.  Easy Rider decor.  A massive Firebird hood hangs on the wall.  A young crowd packed the place.  My wife had the quesadillas - tasty, but more than she could eat.  Our daughter wanted the waffles, but they were not available.  She settled for a regular bacon and eggs breakfast, which was just a regular bacon and eggs breakfast.  I had the three mushroom omelette which was too greasy for my tastes.  Good coffee and great OJ.  A bit pricey for breakfast at $53 for the three of us."}
