{"text":"One of the better breakfast options in Oak Ridges. Not like your typical greasy spoon and the portion is bang on. A great burger too! If it the atmosphere and service was a bit more inviting it could easily be propelled to an easy 4-star rating."}
{"text":"This place is JUST what you want when you're looking for a breakfast spot, some comfort food, or even a spot to have some drinks and apps with friends while watching a game. Its extensive menus got everything: a variety of burgers, sandwiches, and different kinds of poutine, not to mention EVERY breakfast item that could possibly exist, like crepes, breakfast burritos, and steak and eggs!   I'm from California and we're known for our diner grub in the US... and this is as good if not way better than the spots back home!   We loved the service. I guess they must have gotten rid of that bad waitress the other Yelper posted about?  Also noteworthy: best treat to end the meal was the cheesecake, straight from the same makers as the Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Food? Looks good. Texture? Feels good. Taste? Better luck next time. Service? Nothing special. 3 flatscreen tvs? You got it. P.S don't get the eggs benedict unless u luv to poop"}
{"text":"Wonderful little independent place! Warm atmosphere, good food, friendly staff. Highly recommended. They even have Steam Whistle on tap!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast there and it was DISGUSTING. the place was so dirty I don't know how they are still in business.  There was dust and dirt everywhere.  The waitress was very unprofessional and dirty, over and over again she would wipe her dirty hands on her pants.  We orders eggs Benedict mine was with regular bacon. My bacon was RAW nine soft RAW, and after we paid I told her and she said no it's not raw it's medium !!! Hello it's not steak it's bacon. I told her you don't eat bacon medium just like you don't eat chicken medium.  I will NEVER step foot into that disgusting place again."}
{"text":"New to the area, tried this restaurant for the first time today. The food was ok, different, but not bad. The service was awful though, it took half an hour for a food to come. The tap water I was served (which I don't mind)  was room temperature. Our server mumbled, never checked in to see how things were going, and when I asked for more water because my glass had been empty for a while, she acknowledged me, and then proceeded to clean two tables before coming with more water. We were hoping to find a great new breakfast place around the corner, unfortunately this is not it."}
{"text":"This place is OVERRATED. Out of sausage, dirty bitter coffee (no, dark roast isn't supposed to taste like ground), over fried bacon, and service that left much to be desired. Another place on Yelp that is highly over rated and that does not deserve the rating it has been given."}
{"text":"Blue burger is just perfect, I find that in other places burgers with blue cheese either have too much of the cheese in it, overpowering the taste of everything else in the burger completely or so little that you can't tell its there. The blue burger here has the blue cheese figured out just right, and other condiments in this burger compliment the meat and the cheese nicely.  Eggs Benedict are also tasty, also tried Montreal Steak sandwich, and it was nice.  Great portions for the price,  Overall the place is not sterile clean but it's not dirty (cleanliness means a lot to me), service was fast and nice)  I'll be coming back for the blue burger for sure, yummmm)))"}
{"text":"We just used Sunrise Cafe & Grill to cater a post-wedding family brunch... for over 50 people! The food was absolutely amazing. The sausages were a big hit! A huge thank you to Rico and the staff for helping us out. Will definitely be using them again."}
{"text":"After cycling in corridor of oak bridge i went to this place and ordered omelette vegetables it was great And staffs were friendly so i will go there more  New look and new equipment."}
{"text":"On my way home, I saw this diner and thought it'd be nice to visit. I was confused to where to park as there wasn't a proper parking lot.  I was disappointed with the lack of vegan options they had. They only had fish on a bun. I ordered a plate of fries and my sister ordered the spicy thai crepe.  The price was pretty good considering how generous they were with my fries. The taste of the fries? A bit dry. The crepe was too sweet to be paired with the spicy Thai. The crepe over powered the chicken. There was a whole lot more veggies than chicken.  The service was alright. They had 3 TVs so the interior was better than the outside.  Would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"I really love this place it is one of my favourite breakfast places. Large portions, fresh, my favourite is the eggs Benedict. If you come here, I wouldn't be in a rush. Everything is made fresh, and usually their seems to be only one cook in the back. A few times I have been here they have run out of things like ice, and home fries, but they will substitute it for you usually with no extra charges. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food was ok.  We ordered a lumberjack breakfast to share, fruit salad (very generous and good selection), blueberry pancakes (with strawberries as ordered by my 5 year old), coffee, tea, juice.  Early on a Saturday morning the waitress on duty was friendly and service was pretty quick.  It's a small location and by 11am there were at least three other families dining.  We would go back!   p.s. The sausages were great.  We were the first clients for the day so I can understand that grill-wise things weren't as browned as would have been ideal!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast at this cute little diner close to home; the menu offers anything from omelettes to French toast/pancakes to sandwiches/burgers!  I ordered the lumberjack (~$12) (2 pancakes, 3 eggs, bacon, ham AND sausages, toast, and potatoes); the portion was pretty generous. My friend ordered the veggie omelette (~$11) and it was pretty massive, also served with potatoes and toast.   Everything that came out of the kitchen looked massive and delicious. I will definitely be back to try some of the other things on the menu; the girls there are very friendly and service was great."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good breakfast this is the place to come. A small diner hidden in Oakridges, a gem. Full breakfast menu. Daily lunch specials. Dinner menu and bar. Big screen TV everywhere. Situated on Yonge Street and Sunset Beach. Staff are friendly. Decor simple. The only negative, and this is personal preference, they served margarine instead of butter. Will be back after my next walk around the lake."}
{"text":"Rude staff! We were 2 people asking to sit at bigger table as the tiny table she offered us could not fit the plates."}
{"text":"Since coming back to this restaurant a few months ago, we have been regulars on the weekends for breakfast but I think that our most recent experience here will be our last.    We had breakfast there this past Saturday.  I ordered the Bacon and Egg sandwich with turkey bacon, tomato and lettuce.  I asked for the egg to be cooked over medium.  It came to the table fried (omelette style).  I didn't bother to complain because the food took so long to come out that we were going to be late for another appointment.  I was charged an extra $1 for the turkey bacon which didn't entirely surprise me but it would have been nice to have been told in advance that this would be the case.    My bf's daughter ordered the Chicken avocado sandwiche and asked for onion rings instead of fries (like she has every other time she ordered this dish).  The waitress never told us that this substitution would cost us $2,99!  We have never been charged this before and I only noticed this after paying the bill so I asked the waitress (who appeared to be relatively new) what this charge was for.  She went to speak to someone in the kitchen and came to explain that it was for the onion rings.  She went on to explain that if we had ordered a burger and wanted to substitute onion rings for the fries, there would not be an extra charge but since we ordered a sandwich and wanted to have the same substitution, we had to pay an extra $3!  This is ridiculously arbitrary and I mentioned that to her as well as the fact that it would have been nice to have been told that in advance.  Instead of apologizing or offering to refund me the extra charge, she just shrugged her shoulders and said \"sorry, I'm new here\".    I guess that this restaurant doesn't appreciate regular customers so I will not be bothering them anymore with my business.  There are many places in the surrounding area that offer good value breakfasts that I can visit instead (such as Scrumptious (at Bayview and Elgin Mills area)).  They don't charge extra for turkey bacon and the portions are just as generous and the prices are comparable."}
