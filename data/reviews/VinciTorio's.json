{"text":"The best pizza I have found in the valley that tastes like authentic small town NY pizza. We have only tried the basic cheese and sausage (like 5 times since I tried it 6 weeks ago) but we plan to explore more soon! Also, love their Cesar salad dressing!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Italian restaurants in az. I grew up in San Francisco with an Italian great grandmother. The service was wonderful, the staff knew the menu, nightly specials & suggestions for the wine menu. Marcie was was a wonderful waitress, very helpful since it was our first time there.  We had a wonderful evening. The appetizer were a perfect size and we're delicious, ravioli with a jalape√±o ranch?! soup or salad came before your meal (check out the mushroom soup the best I've ever had) my husband had the nites special veal raviola & short rib cannelloni & I had the seafood fradiavolo, both were fabulous. Pastas & seafood cooked to perfection. Made me miss back home. The pistachio gelato was a perfect end to a wonderful evening, so rich & creamy( best pistachio gelato & I've have a few in my life)"}
{"text":"My first impression will be my last impression. We came in for lunch and it was not busy at all. Our server was horrible. She ignored us mostly and when she did take our order, she was not friendly. It was almost like she was avoiding us.   I ordered the lasagna and my husband ordered the hot roast beef sandwich. About 15-20 minutes our food arrives. My lasagna is completely burned on the bottom layer and the marinara tasted more like warmed up tomato sauce out of the can. The hot roast beef was average according to my husband. The garlic bread was nothing to brag about either,  it tasted like the stuff you get  frozen from the grocery store.  I would have been more satisfied going to the Olive Garden, and I don't like that place either. But at least the service would have been better."}
{"text":"my first visit...family took me for my birthday dinner...excellent service...everyone raved about the dishes they ordered...will be back but will make reservation to sit in bar.  So many interesting goods by the door fun t-shirts for Halloween...nice"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in the valley.  I always order the Stromboli which is so large it barely fits on the plate.  I ordered it with pepperoni, bacon, and cheese and it comes with a side of marinara.  Mine was delicious as usual although my friend said hers had cold ham inside, yikes!  For dessert, I had the chocolate gelato with caramel and my friend has the tiramusu which was super rich and creamy.  I would definitely order that again.  The staff was very attentive and always kept my drink full.  I also hear the half price wine bottles on Wed night is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Very happy to have found this place. Not a lot of options without meat so we always eat the same dish the gnocchi with tomato marinara and very happy with it. Great desert and wines too."}
{"text":"Oh man. I can't say enough good about  VinciTorio's.  So, they ADDED a new section - they expanded into the next space, added a BEAUTIFUL wine bar as well as some really neat Italian family style dining tables. There's also a huge new bookshelf full of beautiful bobbles, shiny trinkets, wine accessories, apparel, and goodies for purchase. GREAT prices too!  We went right after Christmas, I had the Seafood special that night. I'm gluten intolerant, and they offered rice noodles, but  I opted for broccoli instead. The chef wanted me to know that the sauce was MADE for noodles, he wasn't sure how it would be with broccoli, and I was OK with it. BROCCOLI FOR THE WIN. It was so stinkin good. Beautiful scallops - perfectly cooked, crab, shrimp and mussels in a creamy, not too thick white sauce. SO good. Oi. Ate it all. ALL.  My family had Tortellini Aurora, Stromboli (HUGE OMG), and Cecatelli. Every meal was completely finished and many \"oommm's\" and \"hummmmm's\". 2 bottles of house Merlot complemented all our meals. Everyone loved and ate all the bread. (Save me. Duh.)  Augie was there. If you HAVEN'T been and DON'T know who Augie is, go. Sit. Listen. Fall in love. With food. With your partner. With the wine. With comfort. Just fall in love...and thank me later."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Italian restaurant.  We liked this one a lot.  Very good service.  The food is authentic with very good flavor.  The asparagus appetizer was great.  The pasta dishes were excellent. The veal dish my wife had was excellent as well.  Very reasonable prices for an Italian restaurant.  Very extensive wine list. This is a great find."}
{"text":"After waiting over half an hour for your food, not to mention the time it took to get a table, I was rewarded with a soggy pizza that had giant holes in the crust.  I find it amusing that the owner himself made my pizza and just threw toppings on the plate to cover the giant holes in the crust."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great atmosphere and awesome service! Fresh ingredients and authentic Italian food - from the appetizer to the after dinner drink, it was scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Good food. On Wednesday, wine bottles are half off. I call it \"wine down Wednesday\". They also have pretty good cheese steaks. Staff is very friendly and they have a back room that can be reserved for private parties."}
{"text":"Excellent veal dishes - great service and ambience.  Relaxing.  The night  we were there there was a guitar player who sang a  variety of \"soft rock tunes  from the 70's thru present.  Our waiter was knowlegable and very proficient. Wine list is unique not run of the mill offerings.  Prices are reasonable for such  high quality food.   Tiramisu is to die for.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Comforting and exquisite Italian food. Atmosphere is warm and cozy where you're seated so close to other tables that all conversations can be heard. Our table for two was small and intimate. A lady was rolling out fresh pasta in a corner up front.  They have a small bar area with live piano music. We came during the holidays and it was packed, but something tells me this neighborhood gem is always busy.  The price is definitely upscale, but the service is friendly and familiar.  We shared pasta with rich creamy green pesto and a seafood pasta dish as well.  We also ordered bruschetta for appetizer. Take it easy with the bread basket because we got so fully from the soup/salad that came with each meal. I would recommend this for family special occasions and perfect to impress for first dates."}
{"text":"Great Italian food and cute atmosphere! Being from the east coast, I am constantly on the hunt for good authentic Italian food. It can be hard to come by and I was thrilled when my husband and I found this great little restaurant. I love the food, the live music nights and the cozy feel. The owners are truly from Italy and they even award a lucky couple each year with a guided tour to Italy by them!  I'm always on the hunt for unique restaurants and this is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed this place and it was a pleasant surprise to find a good yet casual Italian restaurant that didn't remind me or the Olive Garden. The calamari was great and it was a huge serving so by the time we were done with the calamari, bread and salad, I was pretty much ready to go home. But before we realized that, we had already ordered dinner. Luckily we requested half portion with the other half placed in to-go containers so we were not complete gluttons. The service was great and the seating outside was pleasant, less kitschy than the inside. Only problem with sitting outside are the bugs because of the greenery growing around the restaurant. The cost for the meal was reasonable, about $50 for 2 entrees, an appetizer, 2 drinks, and dessert."}
{"text":"We ordered Calamari, Ravioli Carbonara and just some simple Chicken Alfredo and paid almost $45.00 for it all.  After trying our food we decided that it is WAY over-priced for the quality of the food.  I was very disappointed because I love authentic Italian food.  Tthe food wasn't bad, there was just absolutely no flavor to judge it by."}
{"text":"Some of the worst, over priced, bland food I have ever had in my life!  \"Garlic\" bread they brought to the table had no flavor and was cold. Wouldn't give it to my dogs. The salad was composed of the cheapest lettuce known to man...with 2 or 3 good pieces of lettuce thrown in there. Insulting basically. Then the pasta comes. Meat sauce was watery with very few pieces of meat. Beers were over priced. Tables were so close together that my boyfriends chair got hit every time a waiter walked by. Once the 60 year + crowd stops coming, this place will hopefully go out of business. Ugh!!!! I want my 50 bucks back"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurants in the east valley. My friends and I had forgotten about it and decided to dine there this evening. I had the gnocchi and it was delicious. The sauce is soooo fresh and has just the right amount of basil in it. My friends really enjoyed their meals as well. We will of course be returning!! :)"}
{"text":"First impressions are lasting impressions..... my 1 star rating is only because Yelp doesn't allow for 0 stars. My husband and I decided to try VinciTorio's for dinner.    On arrival we were asked if we wanted inside or outside. I said whichever is faster. There was only 1 table occupied outside and several open tables inside, yet the hostess told us it would be a few minutes. That would have been fine, but she proceeded to seat 4 other groups that came in after us. Only one of those groups had a reservation. Not sure how that's acceptable, so I asked to speak to a manager. I'm hoping it was her first day because she was clueless. Her excuse was \"she's up here by herself\". That was not the case. There was a second hostess there. We were a party of 2, yet neither of them could seat us? If they can't figure this out, how is the rest of the service going to be? Wasn't a total loss.... our trip to VinciTorio's helped us discover a great Thai place only steps away."}
{"text":"Italian doesn't get any better than this. The atmosphere is just like it should be. They really care about their food and it shows. Gnocci is light and flavorful.  All their pasta is homemade and it tastes homemade. My girlfriend couldn't get enough of the owner Mario. He really cares and it shows."}
{"text":"Stopped in on spur of the moment after a movie and the place was packed.   We were greeted warmly, seated promptly, and had drinks, garlic bread and brucheta on our table within minutes. I had the Chicken Scarpara and the wife had the Chicken Sausage Cacciatora; both dishes were really, really, good!    This quaint, little, bistro and wine bar has a good vibe. The service and the food were fantastic! We are looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Vincitorio's has authentic Italian food and a great ambience. We were just in Italy and this place reminded us of the restaurants there. We were impressed with the amazing service and our waitress Marcie! We would definitely recommend it for a date night or family dinner."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Hands down the best neighborhood Italian restaurant in the valley.  Truly the real deal when it comes to fresh and authentic Italian food!  I've never had anything that wasn't absolutely delicious.  It's expensive but worth every penny!  Very busy on a Friday or Saturday night so make a reservation."}
{"text":"We have dinner and lunch here frequently.  Mario and Ginger are excellent hosts, in addition to Mario's fantastic cooking.  The Wine Bar area is my favorite part of the restaurant and the wine list is extensive.  Happy Hour between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. has several appetizers and wines to choose between.  My favorites are the Caprese salad and Mario's Garlic Knot Sliders.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"The garlic bread was good. The chicken scarpara was was tough, fatty and and just over all a bad dish. The chicken parm was edible but still not worth the price. Pretty disappointed in the whole experience."}
{"text":"The gnocchi pomodoro was amazing. The server was very nice and had the fans turned off when my seven year old daughter became cold. The pizza was just ok, a little salty. The atmosphere was really wonderful and because the waiter, who I think was named Josh, was so great, I am going to leave a 5 star review. I will be back at VinciTorio's."}
{"text":"Had high hopes but this trip crashed and burned.  We had a 715 reservation and got seated at 740.  The server was in such a hurry she failed to hear that I wanted a bottle of wine and proceded to bring 2 glasses.  I am guessing she saw the odd look on my face because she said oh you wanted a bottle didn't you? And then asked if I wanted a bottle after the glass. Really?  I had the mushroom soup which had no taste any my guest had a salad with vinaigrette and I am not sure it had any oil and certainly had no seasoning.  The food hadn't arrived yet and I am not sure I care if it's good.  The server was horrible and I will not return."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a seafood cioppino. It was expensive and it was simply just spaghetti sauce w/seafood added to it. No broth. It had to much noodles with barely any seafood. Also, it had so much oil in it that i had to ask for a cup of warm water to wash down the oil in my throat. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't good! Garlic bread was good."}
{"text":"Great food!! Some of the best Italian I've had since moving to Phoenix.  The pizza is also outstanding! Definitely recommend. Our server Marcie was great!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Italian restaurant in the area!  Although the place is a bit small, the ambiance and decor is pure Italy with live Italian music playing a few nights a week.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating regardless of how busy they are and the food quality is superb.  My Husband and I like to bring our guests from out of town here as the food always impresses even the pickiest eaters!  They do offer a lunch buffet during the week, however the selection is limited so if it is your first time trying the place I would suggest ordering from the full menu."}
{"text":"Wow,  I am in shock that an Italian restaurant can be this  bad.   Save yourself some money and don't eat here.   The food is horrible."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Tempe.  Love the vibe!  So friendly.  Capellini is great, so is the Tiramisu.  Great wine list & good happy hour (before 6 pm) prices.  Oh yeah - also love the broccoli Stromboli."}
{"text":"We went to VinciTorio's for the first time after reading the reviews on Yelp. I will start with the positive. The food is very good. My wife had the eggplant parmesan and said it was excellent. The sauce was very flavorful. I had the veal parmesan and it was also very good. The veal was extremely tender and also very tasty.  Now the negative. I realize these are minor issues but they should never happen in this type of restaurant. When we were placing our orders, we each ordered a glass of wine . The glasses were $8.00 each. Our server, Adam, suggested that for $24.00 we could have the whole bottle and could take home whatever was left after dinner. We ordered the full bottle. When ordering my meal, I asked what the pasta was. I was told it was penne. I asked if I could have rigatoni as I enjoy that type. I was told I could have whatever I want, but he would suggest the cavatelli. He said that it would go very well with the meal, so I agreed. The check arrives and the wine is now twent six dollars and there is an upcharge of $1.50 for the pasta. I called Adam over and asked about the charges. He said he made a mistake on the wine price and it is $26. He made no effort to correct his mistake. The check said rigatoni, $0.00, cavatelli, $1.50. He said it should have been $4.00, but they only charged $1.50. If there are these charges or if the server gives the wrong price, it should be corrected in thecustomer's favor. No effort was made to do this. I realize that the total is only $3.50 difference, but being told about this seems fair to me. It is a shame that after a delicious meal we were left with a bad taste in our mouths because of the check."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch buffet. Food was great. Server took good care of us. Love the decor in the place."}
{"text":"Ordered to go. Was greeted warmly however, the food is mediocre. Save your money and save your calories."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar on a Saturday night, listening to Billy on the keyboard (always loved Music Box Dancer), chatting with Cody who I'm told does a fabulous pour (I don't drink), devouring a Caesar Salad, Fresh Jalape√±o White Pizza and an always creamy and layers of flavor tiramisu - makes me wonder if I'm in North Beach. Love this place."}
{"text":"I am way too trashy to hang out here.  I mean is this an illusion, or some shifty dream I would have after some sort of physical  trauma induced by drunk tractor driving and the accompanying prescription painkiller abuse? I didn't realize that The Elite of South Tempe dined in a strip mall next to a 3$ cinema and a church called The Vineyard - in a restaurant that sells jewelry in the waiting area, to boot.   Maybe its because I voted for Obama, but this place really caught me off guard. Met some friends for a drink and were told very quickly by the owner that we were being too loud...in the corner...of a bar...where we could barely hear eachother over the pianist's rendition of Mr Brightside by The Killers? Anyway, I think we were underdressed and I made a mistake.   There's always Riazzi's on Mill and Southern or Brioni in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A great family owned Italian restaurant. From their expansive wine list to their handmade pasta, great service and cool ambiance. Try their handmade butternut squash ravioli, the best!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was delicious!  I just forgot to review it immediately, so the details are a little hazy.  I do remember the butternut squash ravioli in a white cream sauce, and it was amazing.  Matter of fact, I don't recall being disappointed with ANYTHING that we ordered."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here a couple times a year for quite a while now.  The food is very good, as is the service. I usually get the lasagna without looking much at the menu.  The house chianti works well.  It's all certainly good enough that we keep going back.   The atmosphere is usually quiet, even when the place is busy.  That means we can talk easily in a calm voice. On the nights that Augie is there with his accordion, the place is usually busier, and I have to think it's at least partly because of Augie.  He doesn't just play around with the squeeze box--he's Good!  He's a classically trained musician, and really puts himself into it, especially when he knows you appreciate it."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall so one might be hesitant when they see the surroundings.  BUT, it has a lovely atmosphere.  It is a little loud especially when the entertainment starts.  However, the single singing voice added to the ambiance.  Excellent service, great food and very reasonable.  Restaurant was very crowded but fortunately they accept reservations.  They also have a large selection of clever t-shirts and wine paraphanelia for sale as you walk in.  Items for sale are tastefully presented and center around the wine theme.  Recommend eating in the wine room - nice setting.  Definitely would go here again."}
{"text":"Made an Open Table reservation, but when we arrived, they said they had no reservation. After waiting 30 minutes, I made another Open Table reservation while standing in the restaurant. They for sure got that one because I was listed on OT's site as a no-show even though I was standing in front off them! The young ladies at the hostess stand were rude and didn't seem to give a damn. We left."}
{"text":"We have been going to VinciTorio's for a number of years... Love the staff and the food..Just got back from there tonight.. It is one of our favorite places to go and eat.. It is \"as good as it gets\"..... We all had something different..We ordered the calamari appetizer to start.... Spaghetti Bolognese.. Eggplant Sorrentino.... Veal Genovese..... Seafood Fradiavolo.... We all enjoyed every last bite.. Fresh.. tasty..  and finished up with deserts that we shared, tiramisu and panna cotta.. I ordered the Seafood Fradiavolo.. I must say that it was the best.. I order this dish the most... Love the fresh seafood.. the mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari all prepared to perfection... the sauce had the right amount of spice.. Don't know if I like the seafood the best or the sauce... I would highly recommend this..."}
{"text":"I came across VinciTorio's on a hunt for a different Italian Restaurant to take my mom to for her birthday, she ALWAYS picks The Olive Garden and my husband and I are on a NO CHAIN RESTAURANTS kick. I found VinciTorio's on Phoenix magazines Best of 2008 list and the info on their website definitely made it look like the authentic family owned feel I was looking for, the restaurant definitely did not disappoint. We went on a Sunday where they have an awesome accordian player setting the Italian ambiance with classic Italian tunes, and a few classic rock tunes thrown in as well =) The bread, salads and entrees were delicious! The prices were definitely comparable to The Olive Garden, but with the more authentic family feel to the restaurant, I will pick VinciTorio's over them any day.  I ordered the Fettucine Pollo Aspargi which was delish but not to far off of your typical fettucine alfredo, my husband ordered the Orrecchiette Campagnola which the waiter recommended which was incredibly good, I couldn't stop picking off his plate!  I'm sure this will become my mom's new yearly birthday dinner choice.  My only gripe was that the waiter got very busy towards the end so it took a while to get our check and we had 3 kids in our party who started getting fussy.  I definitely suggest calling ahead for reservations, the small restaurant was packed!"}
{"text":"I guess I am in the minority, but I just thought VinciTorio's was okay. A couple of my friends are regulars there and had been bugging me to try it out, so last Friday we decided to have dinner there. I called at about Noon and was able to get a 7:00 reservation, which I was pleased with. The interior is covered with pictures of the owner's family, and it has a homey feel.   The bread is made in house, and I would have to say that it was the best part of my meal. There was both garlic bread and foccacia bread with olive oil for dipping, both were excellent. My friend told me that they had the best cream of mushroom soup ever, and even though I do not like mushrooms, soup came with my meal so I decided to try it. It was very under seasoned, just tasted like cream, but when I added some salt, it made it much better.   I ordered the Cannelloni for my entree; Cannelloni is not on every Italian menu, so I was eager to try it. This version was two large crepes with a veal filling and baked in a cream sauce and then topped with some bolognese. Well, I was very underwhelmed by this dish. The filling was extremely dry, and had no distinct flavor. The cream sauce was okay, but I did not care for the bolognese at all, it had a very strong herby flavor, that couldn't even be masked by the cream sauce I only took about 3 bites and then decided to just eat bread for the rest of my meal.   We did have some chocolate gelato for dessert, which was some of the best gelato we have ever had, so at least we were leaving on a high note.   I know others just love this place, evidence by all the people waiting for tables there, but I probably will not be a return visitor."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a pretty bad experience yesterday. My husband ordered the saltimbocca and I ordered the chicken and sausage cacciatora. Both plates were in the $16-$20 range and included salad, pasta, and vegetables. Pasta was clearly a mix of whatever was leftover from something else, we received a mixture of rigatoni and penne. Broccoli was cold. Both my husband and I's dishes were swimming in the sauce and the food was soggy. We were pretty disgusted and just wanted to leave. Stopped and grabbed an oven meal from Target and gave the leftovers to the dogs."}
{"text":"Visited during The Final Four and had a great, authentic Italian meal. The eggplant parmigiana is not that heavy deep fried mess you get at typical 'Italian' restaurants but the real deal: thinly sliced eggplant that is floured, egg washed and then sauteed. Stacked with sauce and cheese and delivered as a generous portion with fresh broccoli, I felt like I was at a friends dinner table. My wife had the manicotti that was equally fresh and tasted like it was made that day- which it was! An extra bonus is the accordion player who rocked Stairway to Heaven to the delight of more than a few tables. We would frequent VinciTorio's if it was in our town and will definitely recommend to any visitors to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This is a surprisingly pleasant space in a strip mall. They offer nice wines and servers are typically adept at offering a suggestion if you need one. They occasionally have some great specials on wine from Italy. I've been there a number of times and the service in the dining room is always great, very welcoming almost like you are at your Italian Grandma/Great Aunt's house.  I will caution that on the patio, you can feel a bit neglected. I went for takeout lunch today. I ordered pasta bolognese and a salad for a total of $23.00! When I told the gal I thought there was a mistake, she just shrugged and said, \"I didn't take this order.\" And that was apparently that. The sad part is that the dish was extremely bland. Even adding some noticeably absent cheese couldn't save the experience. I don't recommend this dish, I guess in retrospect it being served with spaghetti isn't very traditional/authentic to the region. If you go, the eggplant parm is fantastic. The bread they serve is a hit with my 11 year old. I normally don't go for cream of mushroom soup but this is a solid starter choice there. I would encourage people to try it. Pizza is pretty good as well. I like the live music that is often being played at night. I've been there with a guitar player/singer who seemed talented. Although my boyfriend HATES it, I think the wandering accordion player is a charming touch.  Based on my trouble today, I wish 3 1/2 were an option. I feel like 4 might be round up and I tend to round down. I will go there again, which I guess says something."}
{"text":"My husband and I love VinciTorio's Restaurant whether we go for a dinner for two, a family outing, or a group occasion.  It is our favorite restaurant.  The entertainment is always the BEST!  The food and service is always SUPERIOR!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER go to this restaurant again. I was disappointed in every way by the food, service, & overall feel of this place.  Sure they sat us almost immediately after we arrived, however it wasn't til 10 minutes after being seated that we finally had to ASK for a waiter to visit our table. When our waitress arrived she seemed lost & unprepared. We asked for our bill to be split first thing (which later turned out to be \"forgotten\"). Due to the fact that we were waiting 10 minutes just to SEE our waitress's face, we ordered our food & drinks together to save time.  As soon as she took our order it wasn't for another 30 minutes before we saw our waitress again & only after asking our bus-boy to find her. The bus-boy brought us our burnt garlic bread & water but we didn't see any of our other ordered drinks for another 20 minutes. After waiting the 30 minutes she came back to our table & tried to RE-VERIFY our food order. Didn't you write it down?!   Since we were in a pinch for time at this point, we asked for our salads/soups to come out with our meals. My friend had ordered the chicken ceasar salad as her meal so, naturally, when all the soups/salads were brought out we were expecting her meal. Instead they had forgotten to add the chicken so the waitress took it back & apparently they had to start cooking my friends chicken for her salad because it took another 15 minutes to get HER salad.  Really?!! It's a salad people! So the rest of us ate our meal while she watched since again, we were all in a pinch for time. Ridiculous!   I had ordered the chicken & sausage cacciatora & let me tell you......it was probably the nastiest concoction I've ever eaten. The dish was unrecognizable by its name. It was lathered in tomato water, yes water, not even tomato paste or sauce. It was watered down & tasteless. The chicken was rubbery & the sausage was disgusting. I tried my boyfriends lasagna which was less than mediocre. I thought, well maybe the salad would be better so when my friends salad finally came out I asked for a taste. I mean, how do you get a chicken ceasar wrong? Well, it was also quite revolting. Overall the food was attrocious. I made a comment to my friends that I'd rather throw the few bites of food up than have it sit in my stomach.....and it would probably look the same as it did when it first was set in front of me. Yep, it looked like vomit.  I would NEVER refer anyone to this restaurant & would throw a word of caution to anyone who might be thinking of going.   I forgot to mention, we met some friends there who were seated immediately as well, but they had to ask for their waiter as well just to get some drinks. Apparently they were so short handed that the manager had to bus their table. Sad part is that they came in, got seated & had their drinks before we did & it still took them around 20 minutes to be served. Lucky for them, they didn't order any of that slop.  Lets just say, I would've been better off shoving my finger down my throat & yacking that sh** up rather than forcing my body to digest such swill.   When I first walked into the restaurant I was surprised at how nice it looked. It was like getting a gift box with a pretty ribbon on it.  You're so excited, right? Then, when you open the box you find nothing but a steaming pile of sh**. Disappointed? Yeah, so was I.  No matter how pretty the box looks its still just a box of sh**.   Don't even get me started on prices in this joint!!!  Makes ya feel like a total moron to walk into a place like that, get served the way I was, & still have to pay ridiculous prices for wretched food & service. Too bad I'm an honest person otherwise I would've walked out without paying. Nobody likes having to pay nearly $70 for food that came straight from the pigs trough.   My advice for the owner.........fire your cook, hire more competant staff, & drop your prices. I will be telling everyone I know & even some that I don't, to NEVER go to this restaurant after my dinner service last night."}
{"text":"My Husband and I frequent this restaurant often. We have never been disappointed. The eggplant parmesan, chicken & sausage cacciatore, lasagna, and seafood pasta fradiovlo are all excellent. Vincitorio's has a comfortable atmosphere and live music several nights a week. We love wine Wednesday's when a bottle of wine is 1/2 price."}
{"text":"The best kept secret in Tempe!  My wife and I went to have lunch here after we noticed it hidden in the corner of this complex a few weeks back. I am so happy we did!!! I have found my new favorite Italian restaurant in Tempe!   The atmosphere was very nice and clean. A great romantic place.  My wife and I went to Italy for a few weeks last May and we're looking to capture that one of a kind taste we fell in love with, and we did just that!  We ordered the Linguine Vongole..... It was Amazing!!!! If I was on death row and they asked for my last meal I would have them get me this meal!!! The food was so good! The service was friendly and quick. The wine list was beyond great. I am so happy we found this place!"}
{"text":"Third times a charm... Unfortunately, for me it was a strike out. Living in the valley for over 20 years I used to visit this establishment when it was the cheesesteak place.  Having visiting it again many years later it was a great place to have a homemade pasta meal. Unfortunately, having visited 3 times hoping for more in the last 6 months I've had to decide to give up the hope for a good meal/service and move on.  My first visit a few months ago on Saturday evening resulted in great service however, my ravioli was swimming in so much sauce I could barely find them.  Remembering how great the cheesesteaks were I decided to give it another go on a Sunday afternoon prior to a movie. There were probably 3 tables total eating in the restaurant and we decided to sit at the bar.  The person stocking the bar ignored us while a server finally came by after 10 minutes of waiting.  We ordered our cheesesteaks and remembered why we came in the first place, as they redeemed the lack of service.  My third visit with a group of 5 on a week night where there were 6 total tables dining will be my final visit to VinciTorino's.  The service was slow and the food disappointing.  My chicken parm was swimming in so much sauce it was soggy and the pasta disappointing.  I don't if the expansion of the restaurant has ruined the service and food quality, but it's definitely lost a once loving customer."}
{"text":"Had a great night at corona graduation.  Then hit vincitorios. What a great idea. Kitchen closed but the chef offered a pizza.  I said sure surprise us. Omg sausage Italian ham mushrooms artichoke.  Sat in the wine bar and listened to fun and cheerful music.  Must have been an owner or manager but the young people one after another came to this woman and hugged her goodnight. Best value - food, atmosphere, positivity and price I have experienced in quite a while.  Love this neighborhood place."}
{"text":"We went here for my bookclub.  The waiter was fabulous, despite being slammed with a few other large tables.  He took the time to understand my wine preference and made a great recommendation (which I unfortunately can't remember).  I had the cream of mushroom soup which was wickedly rich and creamy and the house salad which was nice.  It would have been the perfect light dinner had the bread not been so delicious that I also enjoyed too much of that - my bad.  Will definitely be back to experience some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"My family has been regulars here for many years and you'd think that the owners would at least pretend to recognize us once in a while.  No such luck.  I've brought people here for lunch twice in the past two weeks, and each time Ginger greeted us like strangers.  (And I use the word \"greeted\" very loosely; no warm fuzzies here.)  Once you get past the attitude at the front of the house, the food is decent, particularly at lunch.  The lunch buffet is well-priced and easy for meetings.  The service staff is good.  Just don't expect a goodbye or thank you when you go out the front door."}
{"text":"Mario and Ginger are awesome!  Love going to the small, neighborhood restaurant. Everything is fresh and the food is excellent.  The bread is awesome too. If you're dieting; stay out!"}
{"text":"I was craving red sauce and angel hair pasta, and kind of limited on where to go since I did not want Olive Garden or a Pizza joint.  I saw this place on Yelp and it was very close by.  Driving up to this strip mall establishment I really had low expectations, despite it's numerous good reviews. Upon I walking in I was immediately taken by the nice comfortable lighting and warm wood interior.  We were sat quickly at a nice table near a window.  There was a nice crowd already enjoying themselves- mostly- if not all couples and a couple of 4 tops.  No giant groups of children or bridesmaids!  Thankfully, it was peaceful and pleasant.  I could hear the music being played- some 70's classic light rock. Perfect. My Caesar salad was fresh, appropriately sized and slightly different in flavor from typical Caesar Salads.  A little extra tangey-in a good way!  My dining partner and I decided on the same thing- A tossed sausage, spinach and angel hair pasta with a creamy tomato sauce.  Amazingly good!  A mall basket of garlic bread came with so we could sop up the extra sauce. Prices were fair and the service was nice as well.  I will definitely come back.  the only thing that was strange was the fact that the hostess stand and immediate surroundings are shrouded with jewelery, knickknacks and silly gifts.  These wares for sale were distracting from the otherwise unassuming 'Old World\" decor."}
{"text":"I took an out of town relative to this place because it's near where she is staying and Yelp recommended it so highly. I'd never been, but I had great expectations and I was not disappointed! First of all, it's attractive, it has a great cozy atmosphere and walking in you get the feeling you're in for a treat. The sights, the smells, everything is in perfect place. I ordered angel hair with marinara and meatballs added. The meal came with some excellent garlic bread and a competent side salad with creamy Italian dressing exactly the way I like it. The meatballs were a tad dry, but their flavor was impeccable. The marinara had a bright, fresh tomato flavor. I love a good marinara that is not overwhelmed with spices and allows the tomato to shine. This was that thing. My companion had the angel hair pasta with meat sauce and was less impressed. I tasted her dish myself, it tasted as if the meat were perhaps smoked? It was a bit odd. Still quite edible, but it did feel as if it had maybe been sitting around too long. Not sure what to make of that.   The menu is perhaps weighted too heavily to pizza parlor fare, strombolis and pizza take center stage and the fresh pasta that others have mentioned in reviews was not to be found. I know the mix and match pasta/sauce/optionals is popular here in AZ, but I find it a bit off-putting that it took me a couple of minutes to figure out how to order spaghetti and meatballs. (ie: \"select angel hair pasta.\" \"select marinara sauce.\" \"select meatball add-on.\" \"VOILA! Spaghetti and meatballs!\") Call me crazy, but I yearn for menus that, you know, have \"Spaghetti and meatballs\" as an entree option and perhaps a sentence at the bottom saying \"substitute any pasta you wish.\"   These are minor quibbles, however, our overall experience was very nice and even after ordering one additional to-go order for my dear, sleeping wife (she works nights) I got out of the place for just over thirty bucks! Wow! We weren't drinking booze of course and it was lunch, but I was still impressed. It's a bit out of the way for me, but if I'm in the area again, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were in from Colorado visiting family and my older daughter wanted pasta for dinner.  Our in-town family was busy for dinner that night so we were on our own.  We asked the front desk clerk at our hotel for a recommendation and he sent us here.  Very glad that he did!  Everything we ate was delicious!  My 5-year-old raved about how good the alfredo sauce was and I loved the bolognese and I am kind of a bolognese snob.  I try it at most Italian places we eat at and we have eaten it in NYC and Europe.  I think this could compete easily with the NYC restaurants and NYC.  Friendly staff and fellow customers made it a wonderful evening.  Sad we had to go back to Colorado and I can't wait to head back to AZ for family and pasta!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing bread basket and highly recommend the gnocchi! Great ambiance. One side of the restaurant has the feel of being in Italy - a classic Italian charming and cozy little restaurant - other side of the restaurant has more seating and feels more like a typical restaurant in Tempe. The service was great but this place is no secret so definitely **make a reservation** unless you want to wait an hour or more to be seated!"}
{"text":"The classic Italian restaurant provides a very comfortable atmosphere with incredible service. The wife and I came for our anniversary and it was indeed a romantic and wonderful evening. The garlic bread was warm and very tasty, followed by delicious mozza sticks. My wife really enjoyed her gnocchi (with added sausage), however I was less than impressed with my veal. While spiced and seasoned very well, with a tasty side of pasta, the veal itself was a little tough and not at the high quality you would expect. Also, the cream of mushroom soup starter, was not very good - I sent it back after a few bites. The mushrooms were still quite hard, almost crunchy, and the soup wasn't seasoned very well. (The server did offer to bring another soup, which I declined) We followed up with some tiramisu which was very delicious and definitely a positive ending to our romantic night. If we were ever in the area again (tourists) we would come back, but I would not order the veal."}
{"text":"Mario and his wife are great people. The food and atmosphere are fantastic. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Ok. I'm so confused by the reviews for this awful place. Shocked might be a better description. The atmosphere is cheesy and loud and the food is absolutely dreadful. I was shocked that the restaurant was full. I'm new to the area, but have had far better Italian food than this. I almost didn't eat the meal (veal marsala). My boyfriend had the chicken parm and said it was on par with lean cuisine. The sauce was very watery and didn't taste great (both the marsala and the red sauce). Pasta was over cooked. I have to conclude that the same people that think Olive garden is good Italian are rating this with 4 and 5 stars. Actually, I would have rather have eaten at Olive garden to be honest. I'm from a very Italian neighborhood in upstate New York, I guess my expectations are high to begin with but this was borderline inedible.   And the PRICES! What a rip off!  Relatively small portions. Not that I minded much because I would have had to eat more of the crap food :-P   Needless to say we won't be going back, even though it's really close to our house.   If you have ever had real Italian food, please save yourself the money and disappointment."}
{"text":"Xavier got it right... it's 5 star worthy for sure!  I can't wait for my next visit to this family owned, authentic Italian eatery! If you have never been to VinciTorio's in Tempe,  do yourself a favor and make a reservation right away.  This is by far my favorite restaurant here in Arizona. And I know a lot of places to go to have a nice meal... VinciTorio's is tops!   I'm ready to go again right now!"}
{"text":"One Star--I'd give ZERO if I could.  Friday evening, 2-6-15, 8:15, seated almost immediately and then.......nothing.  A lot of tables were leaving so the \"rush\" appeared over.  Waiters we knew walked by and said hi (we've been regulars for several years) but this evening, after 15 minutes, we stopped the hostess that seated us and asked when would our waiter come by...she seemed surprised and apparently went looking.    Another 5 minutes or so goes by and a waiter we hadn't seen before comes up and without any apology for the wait just said something to the effect \"what will you have?\".  I decided that I didn't want to spend $60 or so on dinner and drinks at a place that valued our past loyalty so poorly and we left.  Disappointing since it is a close location, decent food, reasonably priced and when our \"regulars\" take care of us, we get excellent service.  On occasion, we've seen other diners walk out in the past over similar poor service and can now understand their anger and frustration.    Loyalty is fleeting and based on the latest experience but it is a two-way street.   It will be a long time --- if ever --- before we're willing to give this place another chance to abuse us."}
{"text":"Tonight we visited this wonderful Resturant!! We are visiting from Ca and Iowa. 5 of us went to dinner st 5P. We did not have a reservation, I would recommend even on a week night make a reservation. The place was packed by the time we left.  The Happy hour is great, even served in the dining room. The food was fantastic. We all had pasta dishes which came with either soup or salad, the wedding soup is great. All pasta dishes were so good. We can't wait to return. The service was exceptional.  Thank you for a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Three of us had a late lunch and very much enjoyed it, though it was more expensive than we'd expected (average of about $16 per person). I LOVED the Ravioli do Zucca, which is made with sweet potatoes. Totally heavenly. Mom loved the clam linguine. My son had the eggplant parmigiana and found it good but not great, wishing for more eggplant and less sauce, but the sauce was very tasty. The dinner salad with Italian dressing was also great."}
{"text":"Great food! Tried something different this visit.  Ordered pizza I know it's not that original but usually get pasta dish.  Very good .  NExt time hungry for pizza will be ordering from here for sure. Not sure why took me so long to try the pizza.  Crust nice and crunchy .  Husband order his usual cheesesteak sandwich. I can never get him to try anything new.  The  homemade chips are so good you have to try them. You will order sandwich just to get the chipsl"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The minute you walk in the door you feel like you're in an authentic Italian restaurant. The decor, food, service and live music on the weekends is amazing. We have tried just about everything on the menu and the anti-pasto salad it's simply the best! Their extensive wine menu and great prices are an added bonus. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this spot. The atmosphere was very nice even romantic.  The service was nice as well. I tried their lasagna which was good...I would like to return for another entree and Wine Wednesdays. :)"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I expected good tasting food. Their salad was iceberg and a few olives, the complete tasted like nothing. Even their bread is tasteless. Unbelievable how much this place charges. Their wedding soup was just gross."}
{"text":"After having stayed in Italy for a 6-week study abroad, I was terribly sad not to find anything that compared. And then I came here and man, it blew almost everything else out of the water, even some restaurants in Italy.   The wine is served in great big glasses. The entrees are man, oh man, delicious-- freshly made pasta, wonderful bread, great salads. I'm getting hungry thinking about it now and trying to think of a reason to go. It's superb. Oh, and the tiramisu-- don't even get me started-- amazing and I don't even like coffee.   Go here. Take your hunny out, go alone, go as a group, whatever, just go here and relish the tastes of Italy."}
{"text":"Hostile vibe. Walked in the door 40 minutes before closing and the staff was not happy. No smiles , no good evening , no introductions of names. Seems we were bothering them. Only one star because the cook was excellent. I won't go back. I will go to Olive Garden next time at least there nice and the food is usually good too."}
{"text":"How does this place have 4 stars?  How?!  We feel Yelp really lead us astray on this one.  This meal was absolutely terrible.  Garlic bread was cold scraps with hardly any butter, salads were overdressed, and the entrees were gross.  I had the shrimp and salmon over fettucine in tomato cream sauce.  The sauce was so watery that it didn't cling to the pasta at all - tasteless.  The shrimp still had tails on and tasted dirty.  The salmon was okay, but there was hardly any of it.  Three small pieces of salmon, three shrimp - for $20.  Ridiculous.  BF had the chicken scarpara, which was chicken with mushrooms and peppercino in white wine sauce with penne pasta.  You would think the chicken/sauce would be over the penne, but it was actually served on the side with some meh marinara.  The sauce itself tasted so strong of peppers and vinegar that it burned.  The chicken seemed boiled and was tasteless.  The waitress didn't say anything or ask us what was wrong when we had her take away our barely touched plates - not sure if it was bad service or if she just hears complaints all the time and didn't want to deal with it.  The only good thing about this place was the accordian player's version of Eleanor Rigby.  Oh, and the laughs we had imagining what Scott Conant would say about this \"authentic\" Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"There is only 1 place to get the best Italian food, great ambiance and the best staff I've ever come across! We have been here more then a dozen times and it is superior every visit. It doesn't matter if it is a busy weekend night, casual lunch or take out, professional and delicious! The most important thing to me is they could have people waiting out the door, but you would never know I've never felt rushed to finish my dinner. Make a reservation, go and enjoy"}
{"text":"Overall it was just ok. Bomba desserts are probably the best thing they serve."}
{"text":"We were looking for an Italian place close by to home and found this gem right here on Yelp. Had great reviews so we decided to give it a try. Very busy, but only waited about 15 minutes for a table on a Saturday night. Loved the decor, the vibe, the food, and the customer service was awesome!  We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"In the 30 years they've been there they have acquired a loyal following. I was there for the first time last Saturday and this is a frank, honest reveiw. I've eaten Italian food in restaurants from New York to San Francisco and from Rome to Hong Kong over a span of 50 years. The food here is average Italian. I'm not saying bad; I'm just not saying excellent. The menu is essentially a modest one that serves the level of the kitchen's expertise, and the pricing is modest as well which is good. The serving staff was attentive which is a plus but not enough to outweight a very negative part of our dining experience. When we arrived it was busy and waited for a table which was no problem. After about 15 minutes, we were asked if the patio was okay. After a yes, we followed the hostess through the area that we had viewed as the patio out to the very end of the restaurant. There was an empty table next to us that was never filled (in spite of other people waiting to be seated that probably knew better) and faced the parking lot. An open door, used by waiters, to our left blocked any view of the rest of the patio. We were isolated in a small dead-end of the patio (which was formerely a sidewalk converted into a patio) that totally separated us from any real restaurant experience. There was not a single diner within view during our meal. Cars did use the parking lot in front of us however which was something to look at. I understand the restaurant's desire to maximize profit by seating customers wherever possible. However, seating people at this location is over doing it. Dinning out is more than just an eating experience. Ambiance is involved as well and the lack of consideration in this respect completely destroyed our Saturday dinner out. After a few minutes there, I resisted the desire to get up and leave but I surely will never go back."}
{"text":"Went back as promised we would.  Gave an extra star this time but only for the food.  The waitress we had was in charge of 7 tables and while she took our drink order immediately, it had to have been 15 minutes before we saw our drinks.  She did apologize on her way past one time and I told her that she was rating an F thus far. Don't think it was really her fault but service was as poor as what it was good on a previous visit. At least this time my food was not cold.  My husband and I shared the caprese salad which as I mentioned in an earlier review, is the best I ever had just for it's uniqueness. Soup came with our dinner and I had the wedding soup which is supposed to have tiny meatballs.  Mine had none but I have to say it was the most flavorful soup I have ever tasted. My husband had the chicken and sausage cacciatori which he says was excellent.  I had the veal genovese which was very flavorful also.  My only disappointment is that the waitress said I could not have the same sauce on my pasta as what was on the veal.  Don't get me wrong, their red sauce is good, I just prefer to have whatever sauce is on my entree on the pasta as I am not a fan of red sauce - I never order anything but white pizza for that reason. Which reminds me - we did stop there on a Friday night a few weeks ago and I had a white pizza - brick oven scrumptious. Hubby had a cheesesteak which he says was also good for not being the true Philly cheesesteaks we were accustomed to in South Jersey with the South Philly influence.  It really is all about the bread which few places around here can replicate. So Vincintorio's has moved up to a 4 in my book and, of course, we will go back."}
{"text":"i now have been to Vincitorios 2 times.  once for dinner several months ago, and back today for lunch.  overall it's a fine place, the garlic bread is warm and flavourful, the staff were extra friendly and on top of our station...tho it should be noted that we were the only table seated in the place.  it was Memorial day after all, and by the time we left, less than an hour later there were another 12 people seated and happy to be waited on. months ago i had the chicken fettuccine alfredo with asparagus, and it was excellent.  i had leftovers to spare, the cannoli was for dessert and i remember it being extra dolled up w/ choc. chips and raspberries, and thought we would get 2 for the $6 price tag.  we did not.  there, was however  an accordion player mixing in james taylor and U2 songs to keep it \"authentic.\"   today a friend of mine was told to check the place out for their \"philly cheese steak\" so we both go and order one each.  i said hold the onions but give me the marinarra.  my friend did the exact opposite.  it was fast, the home-made chips were awesome, the cheese steak was really good.  i didn't finish mine so i could eat it again tonight for dinner.  i will be happy to do so... our bill was 20 bucks for the both of us so it's really well priced!! and the place was relaxed and groovy.... so before you check out a cheap movie or just after the movie lets out @ tempe cinema, check out vincitorios.  i might make it more of a staple."}
{"text":"The lunch is okay but dinner is better.  Some of the dishes are overly rich but the homemade pasta is terrific.  Overall, a good local restaurant."}
{"text":"Took some friends to this place over the weekend and will not go back.  After we got our water glasses filled by the busboy, he dropped off some dried burnt bread.  It took our waiter about 10 minutes to show up and the experience moving forward got worse.  Our server Brad never offered a wine list and then when we got suggested a red wine, but didn't ask what type of wine we were searching for.  Then it came to the food.  We asked him about specials and any suggestions he could offer since it was a first time at this restaurant and his response was everything is good.   Well we then asked what were some of the most popular dishes and he suggested then the salmon and shrimp Vincitorio's along with the seafood fradiavolo.   Our friends then ordered the Veal Genovese and Cavatelli al forno.  None of us were pleased with our meals, but did not realize it until we had left and started talking about the quality of the dishes.   The salmon was fishy tasting, not fresh at all.  There were only 1 1/2 pieces of shrimp in both of our dishes.  The artichokes were over salted and the Cavatelli al forno was just okay.  Our server never offered us a second basket of bread, not any fresh parmesan for our meals, not to mention never came back to refill our water glasses that were empty.  If it wasn't for the 2 bottles of wine we ordered we would have not nothing to drink.  After reading many positive reviews on this restaurant, we were sadly disappointed and will not go back.   There are much better places to go to within the Chandler Tempe area for Italian food."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Family owned and run, fresh pasta, nightly specials. Live entertainment (but not too rowdy for a classy but casual place like this) several nights a week. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great italian food in a local non-chain restaurant.  Mario the owner is almost always on site in the kitchen or out front saying hello to customers. Live music most nights as well!"}
{"text":"As an Italian who has traveled (and eaten) extensively in Italy, let me tell you this is truly authentic Italian food from the south, specifically Puglia and probably some Calabria thrown into the mix. For appetizer, we chose the calamari fritti and the posillipo. The latter is more or less seafood in a somewhat spicy red sauce that's a little more watery than it would be if it was just used on pasta. Calamari is often disappointing at other area restaurants because the seafood is sub-par and it comes out greasy because the kitchen either doesn't know how or doesn't care to fry it right. Here, the calamari is light and crispy and not oily. It comes with a marinara sauce that is also similar to the sauce used with the posillipo.  Our entrees were the stuffed pork chop with gnocchi, a salmon entree with penne pasta, and two of us ordered the seafood fradiavola that we heard so much about. The only not-completely-positive thing I have to say about it is that the seafood is just not quite as fresh as  it would be if you were dining near the ocean. It's OK, about as good as one has a right to expect in Arizona without paying $10 more per plate. (I did not ask how fresh the seafood was.) The fradiavolo was in a sauce similar to that made for the posillipo. It came with an abundant amount of pasta (perhaps even too much). It was excellent. If you do not like things spicy, be sure to tell the waiter and he can have the kitchen hold off on the amount of chili pepper flakes used; conversely, if you like things spicy tell them so!  As I mentioned, the portions are HUGE. So go easy on the appetizers and bread unless you are really hungry.  The wine selection is extensive. We ordered the cheapest bottle of Chianti at $24 and were surprised at how good it was; usually I avoid the cheapest bottle and get the 2nd cheapest bottle if I'm feeling frugal.  The dessert selection is also extensive but not daunting. I had the limoncello flute, which was quite refreshing to finish the dinner. I am pretty sure they actually used limoncino (creamy limoncello) with the lemon sorbet. My dining companions, I don't know how they had any room for dessert but they were equally delighted with the chocolate covered spumoni and the humongous truffle with peanut butter core.  And just to cap off this experience that took us all back to our fond memories of Italy, we ordered four macchiati. Of course, the coffee was excellent too, just as good back in Italy.  Bravissimo, Mario! We look forward to returning again and again!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour tonight. Unreal selection of happy hour wines by the glass, great deals! The appetizers were good, had the caprese salad, flatbread with goat cheese and a nice dessert.  The ambiance was cozy and quaint and reminded me ofi Italy.  Windows are shaded so you really feel like you are out of Arizona and transformed. Would go back again for dinner."}
{"text":"Regular customer, fabulous food, cozy atmosphere, al fresco dinning available, sincere and affable staff,  live music, and when you go ask for Adam for truly outstanding service and expertise"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner there about a month ago. We were given a table with a very loud and rude waiter who insisted on directing his questions to me and not my wife. We both had soup one was fair and the other being cream of mushroom which was awful. We then noticed that the circular holder for condiments was coated with grease and a dead insect. I handed to the hostess and she said OOH and whisked it away. The spaguetti and clams were very good and veal picatta was average."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the buffet lunch.  Fresh salad and pasta/meat dishes. Simple but done well.  Great value at 9 bucks that includes a drink.   Very cozy and clean atmosphere with a great staff. Owner is great as well.  I will be taking wife back for dinner as the wine selection looks solid.  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"OUCH! My birthday dinner from fiends. I found the atmosphere to be rather :kitschy\" gaudy cheap jewelry on a rack and stretching the length of  a hallway from the dinning room to the wine bar----, that should have been a clue...can't make it on the food we will sell junk!  I ordered Calamari, just half cooked, tough and large rounds thick rounds, the only eatable part were the little feelers. The salad, poor dressing no flavor, brown leaves from the \"wink wink\" from the fresh green salad. Ordered Veal Picatta, it was served in a flour sauce, absolutely no flavor and so thick and sticky, 50 caper sprinkled on top, were not cooked with sauce it did have a one slice of lemon.  Dessert: a ball of Spumoni dipped in a hard chocolate covering, kind of like Dairy Queen! I am cured, I will never go back and never tell anyone about this disaster!"}
{"text":"My DH and I had dinner here tonight in their wine bar because they had an incredible piano player entertaining while we ate.  We started with the Antipasto Italiano as our appetizer and were overwhelmed with all the fresh flavors of the fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, peppers, artichokes, several different olives and different salami and ham meats.  DELICIOUS and as fresh as it gets!!  For my entree I tried the lasagna as a recommendation from our knowledgable waitress, and I'm glad I did!!  It was full of flavor of rich tomatoes (probably San Marzano from my guess) as well as homemade pasta noodles and luscious ricotta and mozzarella layered together with huge slices of their homemade Italian sausage.  It was probably the best Lasagna I've ever had!!  My DH went for the Philly Cheesesteak and he was all smiles as he finished every single crumb!!  I finished with the Limoncello Flute dessert which was a great way to top off the entire meal.  DH kept smiling as he ate every bit of his homemade Tiramisu.  VinciTorio's will definitely become part of our life!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever eaten. If your going to dab your pizza, this isn't the place for you snowflake.  Mushroom soup was good. Spicy diavolo was good. Fresh garlic bread delivered to table. 5 different beers on tap. $20 for the best 16\" seven item pizza I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE everything about this place!!! The pasta is made fresh and better then any we've ever had! The mushroom soup is addictive and a must order every time we are there! Friendly, helpful staff are always smiling making it feel like I'm with my Italian friends. AND the dessert is the BOMB! We love the Exotic Bomba!!"}
{"text":"We wanted something light and and a nice atmosphere the Fornarina hit the spot and the atmosphere in the Enoteca was perfect.   We will be back with friends."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, great service, food was just okay."}
{"text":"I would have given more stars because their food and service is excellent, but they bought new tables and chairs for the restaurant the tables are great, the chairs on the other hand are terrible to sit in for any period of time, there is no relief cut into the wood it is just flat; and put's you in a uncomfortable position and is hard on your bottom end and Back. Hopefully they can correct this issue."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place for years...way back when it was Llonghitano's.    I enjoy the family owned aspect.  They have done many improvements to the interior as well as the menu over the years.  It is a solid meal, cosy environment, and a decent value.   Room for Improvement: - add some homemade blue cheese dressing to the menu  - when they employed some Scottsdale culinary peeps in the kitchen the menu had a few more faves, but I still enjoy it (miss the gnocchi and pork chop, a lot!) - wait staff is usually good, but can be stretched during prime dining hours."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian restaurants are few and far between in the Phoenix area. This place is a definite repeat spot. The atmosphere has an old east coast flare to it. The wine list is expansive and well priced, regardless of the numerous specials they offer. And hey, the food is great. Flavorful and filling, each dish brings the comfort of home style Italian cooking that I crave since I moved out west from Philadelphia. On a particular note, the marinara is thin, but full of flavor. I recommend getting just a small bowl of it to dip your bread in! Yum!"}
{"text":"You know what it feels like when you want to a enjoy a good, reasonably priced meal with interesting wines in an atmosphere that does not look like it came out of \"chain restaurants R us?\"  This is that place.  Please eat here.  Enjoy an ambiance reminiscent of Little Italy.   The food is very good.   But, this is more than a good restaurant.  This is a restaurant where you enjoy your time as much as your food.  And, Augie, you are a musician of the highest order.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars for service and food but the chairs are the most uncomfortable chairs ever. I often want to go cause the food is so good but you just can't relax unless at the bar."}
{"text":"The best italian food in the east valley.  The owners, Mario and Ginger, are absolutely delightful and so hospitable.  The service staff is amazing, especially Marcie. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Italian restaurants. Right when you walk in they are very nice and welcome you with open arms. Very family oriented restaurant and they make sure you are please with everything coming out. The food is always very fresh and amazing. Even when really busy they always find a way to make sure your food comes out in an appropriate amount time. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great Italian food for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Wednesday is half off bottles of wine!  All pasta is freshly made. I had the lasagna and my boyfriend had the seafood fradiavialo. They serve huge portions and both dishes were delicious, and come with choice of salad or soup. They had a live singer and the place was packed, made for a great ambiance. Only thing we did not love was the tiramisu, as it was heavier than what we are used to. Highly recommend, we will definitely be back!  Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here for a buffet lunch for a work function.  The atmosphere was nice, but very dim lighting. However, I didn't come here for the decors, I came here for food!  The buffet included salad with ranch or Italian vinaigrette, braised chicken, meatballs w/ roasted veggies, and penne with sun dried tomatoes. Everything was good, but the dish that stood out was the penne. I am huge fan for sun dried tomatoes , and that dish, even though it was vegetarian was my top choice.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience, and would come back and pay with my own money."}
{"text":"Nothing worse than feeling so uncomfortable when trying to dine out. I used to love this place... Every weekend the bar is out of control w/ only 1 bartender, the biggest server who over 6 feet tall is like a bull in a china shop, the owners wife that I believe everyone refers to as Ginger, is so disconnected... Blank stare, seems like she could care less and is forced to be there. Tried to block out the chaos of servers at the bar trying to get their drinks and just listen to the live piano player... Couldn't do it, got most of my meal to go and left. Won't be going back for a while, just seems like they're getting progressively worse & worse which bums me out because like I said, I used to really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"We ate dinner in the Wine Bar and it was Great!  Our server Marcie, was awesome and sooo helpful and fun.  The food was outstanding, especially the mushroom soup.  The live music in the bar was also unbelievable.  A great date night!  My new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"We (my uberyelper husband Jim W and I) ate dinner here, long ago, with fellow yelpers Heather and Ryan C. (I am truly remiss in my review writing, it seems). I'm giving them four stars but it's not an easy four. In fact, I think they're benefiting from the quality of the company. We had a great time. We always have a great time with these particular yelpers. So in some ways that benefits the restaurant because we're already happy. But I digress.  We all agreed that dessert was the high point of the meal. Their tiramisu makes my top five list of best tiramisu(s) ever. Dinner wasn't as big a hit. Chicken parm, one of my favorite things ever, was merely average. Though I can't remember what everyone else ordered, average seemed to be the feeling all around.  The place was lovely and the service was good. I doubt we'll go there again because we moved to LA in the time it took me to get to this particular review. But if Heather and Ryan want to meet there for dessert I might just make the drive."}
{"text":"We had lunch there for the first time today. Oh boy, were we pleasantly surprised. The lasagne was heavenly, the baked eggplant penne, superb and the service excellent. Nice ambiance inside and out. Will definitely be returning to this restaurant again. Try the house Chianti too It's great."}
{"text":"Everything was Awesome except the hostess. Too bad the first impression of the business was so poor."}
{"text":"Love at first bite! Great Italian food, generous portions, excellent friendly service, reasonable prices and no pretentious attitudes! Went with a group of friends. Our reservation was respected and we were seated IMMEDIATELY (unlike at the overrated RigaTony's!) Everybody loved their dinner and even though we stayed on for hours talking, nobody gave us a hassle. Highly recommend the Caesar Salad, Eggplant Parm and Seafood Fra Diavalo. Garlic bread served warm was fantastic and was replenished without having to ask. I'm a fussy New Yorker when it comes to Italian food and this place makes the grade! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Tables too close together, hard to even leave. Service was bad, slow and non existent. Food was good and well priced."}
{"text":"Not sure if this was a rare situation but my first time trying this place with my girlfriend we returned the food from the carry out order we placed. The owner or manager was kind of rude when we asked for the money back. They gave it to us but we won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving for a good family Italian restaurant and I decided to check this place out since it had 4 Stars.  Ambience is great and service was just as good. Appetizers were delicious so we were licking our chops waiting for the food......scratch........  Wow, what happened here the dinner plates were awful. My wife got the chicken scarpala which looked watery and literally scraped. The chicken tasted dated and not fresh, and not sure what the sauce was but it was awful.   I got the Salmon and Shrimp which was one of their special favored. Although it tasted decent, spaghetti was over cooked and sauce way too much and watery.   I ate half of my food and my wife barely touched hers.   She told the waitress about how disappointed she was and that was it. No apology or maybe offer something different, nothing.   I don't think we'll be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"When I was growing up my family used to pretend we were Italian and cook up some baked ziti.  Now we go here to do it instead.  Everything is served fresh, hot and bursting with flavor.   The servers are friendly and attentive, and they have live music sometimes.  When I went with my boyfriend for our birthdays they had this really awesome guy with a guitar playing Radiohead and Cure covers.  I've also been there when they had an accordion and some of the regulars there paused from enjoying their dinner to sing opera.    L-o-v-e, LOVE this place."}
{"text":"The yelp star help guide describes it perfectly. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  I had the philly cheesesteak, some of my friends got the pasta. Overpriced medicore food. Not bad, not good enough for me to want to come back."}
{"text":"We have been coming here a few times a month for about 2 years. Wednesday nights are 1/2 price bottle of wine nights and you will be pleasantly entertained by Sarah who eagerly takes requests and has a great voice. There is not one thing I have had here that I don't like. I love the mushroom soup (it is definitely rich) and my favorite dish is cavetelli al forno. You cannot find a better dessert in the Phoenix area besides their homemade tiramisu."}
{"text":"OMG!! A great menu, great service and delicious food! Real Italian made food. I'm from Southern California and had dinner here and I was not disappointed. Will be definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"I have eaten veal for many years, in many different restaurants, even as far as Paris, France.  It's lower in fat, so care has to be taken in preparation to ensure that it does not become tough.  The key to veal is not to overcook!  Veal cutlets are thin, boneless portions of meat taken from the leg of a calf and are pure protein with no fat and no sinew.  It usually runs from $15 to $30 dollars a pound.  I usually expect to pay $28 or more for a delicious meal of veal.  When I saw the veal prices at Vincitorio's I should have known not to order veal there. This is my opinion, but I think they are using veal cutlets from the shoulder of the calf, which is not tender because it contains too much sinew and connective tissues.  It's probably cheaper, too.  Either that or the chef does not know what he's doing.  The first time I ate at Vincitorio's I ordered the Veal Genovese, which was saut√©ed in lemon-butter sauce, white wine, capers, artichoke hearts and mushrooms.  It was much too lemony for me and the veal was somewhat tough.  I ordered a salad to go with it and how can you mess up salad?  It was awful.  The service was horrible.  Every table was taken and there was only one person waiting on tables.  I felt sorry for her.  It took forever to get our wine to begin with and then it took even longer to get our meals.  I vowed I'd never go back.  But, never say never....  I went back again on Thursday, April 19, with my husband. They brought a basket of garlic bread that wasn't too bad, but it took a long time before someone asked us if we wanted anything to drink.  We waited for quite awhile for our wine.  Finally, someone came to our able and asked if we had a certain wine order...it was ours.  He left and came back with our wine.  It took a long while before someone came to take our dinner order. I wanted to to try their veal again, but this time I ordered the Veal Marsala, which was saut√©ed in Marsala wine with mushrooms.  My salad was brought first and it was so forgettable.  When I received the main course, it did not look very pleasing to the eye.  I cut into the veal with a fork and that did not work, so I had to use my knife.  I knew right away it was a tough cut of meat.  The first bite I took had no flavor, plus it was so full of sinew.  I almost choked when I swallowed it.  The second bite was the same and I kept having to chew it and chew it, but to no avail.  I finally took it out of my mouth and put it back on the plate.  I called the waiter over and told him that I was not going to eat it and he took it away from the table without even asking why or saying he was sorry that I did not enjoy it.  How rude and unthoughtful of him!  He then had the audacity to put a very small plate in front of me and say, \"This is just in case you want to order something else.\"  I told him that I was not going to order anything else.  My husband gave me part of what he was eating.  It was not very good, but at least I could chew it easily and it filled me up.  Again, I'm am not going back to the restaurant and this time I mean it!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre-- the wine list though vast --  I ordered three different glasses trying to find a sweet blush or white wine and all three glasses were dry and bitter -- the waiter was friendly but had that nervous energy -- the guy who poured the water was sweet and had a shred of actual fine dining manor  -- the food was basic and the pasta dish was watery and flavorless. I guess I am used to having Italian food in Boston's north end and was spoiled by \"real\" authentic Italian food. Oh and they claim to have \"fresh\" \"from scratch\" pasta -- yeahhhhh not sure on this as the pasta with clams was delivered in 1 \" of water so there was no zest or sauce -- just flavorless -- that's all I can say. The wine bar is nice and an intimate cool atmosphere but the wine and food don't match the atmosphere ... Is this an Arizona standard? The restaurant scene sucks here ..."}
{"text":"Trofie Al Pesto, Trofie Al Pesto, Trofie Al Pesto! I have been craving some Italian food but was not feeling the chain restaurants. Thanks Yelp viewers because this is now my local Italy. As I walked in I felt very welcomed and was greeted by several staff members. I went solo and had a seat that may be feel a part of all guest. Now the real treasure is the food. I started off with their version of an Italian wedding soup which was very flavorful. The dish that created a tear of joy was the Trofie Al Pesto. Where do I start! I mean this dish gave the theme/ambience a seal of approval."}
{"text":"Warren is a fantastic bartender. If you can have him, do! Fried Ravioli was great. Wine yummy! Nice happy hour choices. Jazz 6-8 Thursday's  :)"}
{"text":"The food was great! The service was as warm as a cold bitter sad robot whose robot cat you accidentally hit with your robot car. The food was served with robotic timing, not too fast or slow, with no smiles whatsoever, no friendliness or joy that you're there. Just sad robots without their personality 3.1 upgrades. Food was really good though!"}
{"text":"Tired of those Italian chains? Then this is the place to try for either dinner or even lunch. It's small and intimate but you don't feel like you're crammed in there. The bread they bring out is warm and yummy. They have a good variety of wines. The pasta tastes home made and very very good. Oh and if there is still room try one of their home made desserts!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant by far. My wife and I drop in at least twice a month.  The owners, Mario and his wife Ginger are lovely people and seem to know most of the clientele.  Mario is actually from southern Italy and his cooking tastes like the real thing, not americanized italian.  The atmosphere reminds me of a restaurant in a small town in Italy- inviting, intimate, fun. Their pizza is amazing, particularly the \"Romana\" - the bacon is cut razor thin to melt in your mouth.  I love all the dishes I have tried but I think my favorite is Mario's home made trofie pasta combined with Capellini sauce- to die for.  You can mix and match- Mario can cook just about anything and it is always a treat.  We have brought over 25 friends and family at different times over the past few years and all have loved it."}
{"text":"What a hidden treasure! We found this amazing place on Yelp by looking at the map. Don't let it's strip mall location fool you! The wine list? Extensive! If you love wine... You won't be disappointed. The prosciutto wrapped asparagus is to die for! And we shared a delicious house pasta. I wish I could remember what it was but it was the special that night and not on the menu. Our server was gracious and knowledgable. Dessert? Tiramisu. Oh. My. Yum! Then... The chef came out to personally greet us (with a little lemon cello to thank us for trying them out)! What an amazing night... What a beautiful place. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Okay first we were there for a special day.We arrived at prime time we were seated within 10 min.That was nice.The decore was dated in my opinion.I did notice the clientele was more senior.The waiter was great.Here is why I gave it 1 ....food was awful! No flavor, seemed like jar, canned sauce.the bread was not freshly baked,like frozed Texas toast/ French bread. I am surprised that the reviews were so great.I would suggest going elsewhere if want flavorful food."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great ambiance, friendly service but enough quiet to have a nice conversation. Really yummy cheesy pizza!"}
{"text":"Just got back from this little place, went to lunch with my boyfriend. We went for the lunch buffet, which unfortunately ended a half hour before we arrived, but we decided to stay anyways. It was a very good decision.   Oddly enough, we were the only people in the restaurant, but I'm guessing that's because of its off the beaten path location. It's tucked in the plaza next to Tempe Cinemas, SE corner of McClintock and Elliot. Logan was the bartender/server, friendly enough, good service.   I had the Italian Beef sandwich which was AMAZING, best I've had since I left Chicago 5 years ago. My boyfriend had the Italian Wedding soup, loved it, and this ravioli dish which I can't remember the name of but its cheesy with butternut squash in a cream sauce, says its the best he'd ever had.   We finished with a coffee, a latte and some tiramisou (never could spell that word) and were stuffed and satisfied. The total bill came to just under $40 and was worth every penny.   I am the worlds pickiest eater, and I definitely loved everything I ate. We will be back =)"}
{"text":"I can't believe more people don't know about Vincitorio's -- it's easily  the best Italian restaurant in the Valley. The great food, combined with a cool atmosphere (a lot of people are regulars who the bartenders and owners know by name) earns it five stars from me.  My husband and I found this restaurant by accident as we had some time to kill before watching a movie in the adjacent, slightly-ghetto Tempe Pollack Cinemas. We just grabbed some wine and an appetizer, but after looking at the menu, we had to come back.  That was a year ago, and this place has never disappointed us since. It's a small, cozy place with a guitar-playing singer on weekend nights. Also, one of the waiters is an opera singer and he will occasionally belt out  a quick song, a Capella, in the middle of the restaurant.  When my husband and I came here Friday night, we started off with an appetizer of asparagus (cooked perfectly) with prosciutto. Then I had the eggplant parmigiana (I'm sure it's terribly fattening, but was delicious) and he had some special with seafood and a spicy marinara sauce. He said it was delicious. We finished with a huge piece of their tiramisu, which is heavenly and surprisingly light (for tiramisu, that is...).  The only thing that 'could' be a downside to this restaurant is that it's small and tight, so sometimes, even if you make reservations, you might have to wait around for 15 minutes. It's gotten even busier since Phoenix Magazine ran a feature on it, too, last year. That's not an issue for us -- just give yourself some extra time if you are in a hurry.   When we came here for Valentine's Day last year, they were running quite behind -- but the owners gave everyone who was waiting a complimentary glass of champagne, which I thought was really a nice touch.  Oh, and if you get a chance to try their butternut squash ravioli, go for it...it's great, too."}
{"text":"Anyone who doesn't give this restaurant 5 stars does not know Italian Food. From the moment you walk into the quaint, Old World setting and are greeted by one of the gracious hosts, or even the owners themselves, Ginger and Mario, you are in for a magical experience. The food is excellent, the ambiance is for all occasions, and the wine list is one of the best I have seen in Arizona. Just think an Italian restaurant with Italian wine on their list. From the Vermintino and Orvietto, to the Sangiovese, Rosso di Moltacino and Brunellos there is something for all to enjoy. Don't forget their end of the month Dueling Pianos event. This place is the bomb!! Don't be shy and go on by, you won't be disappointed. Ciao Bella!!!"}
{"text":"Wine bars in the Southeast Valley are hard to find, aren't they?  (Everyone say 'yes'.)  Well, now we have a darling one right in the middle of the south Tempe 'hood.    I went here for happy hour tonight.  Here's the 4-1-1:  1. Location--Excellent 2.  Ambiance --Outstanding. We sat in the wine bar which is absolutely COOL.  It's rustic-looking, cozy, and perfect for meeting the girls or having some quiet time with a sweetheart.  The place is well-decorated and offers an eclectic assortment of wine-themed gifts.  Love it! 3.  Wine Selection--Impressive.  Many wines are offered by the glass and those are all $5 each during happy hour. 4.  Wine Pour--Respectable.  Not skimpy at all. 5.  Food Selection--Great looking menu, but only one appetizer on special and we didn't order that one (hence my four-star rating). 6.  Pizza--Yummy!  We had the white pizza which was delightfully full of garlic and loaded with cheese. 7.  Service--Good.  Our waitress even offered me a taste of the Raymond Cabernet which comes straight from the barrel.  This place is good.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Reservations for Friday night for 7, we were seated immediately which was great because the place was packed.  Great service throughout the night and the kitchen appeared to have everything totally under control.  The food was very good, we started with the mozzarella stuffed with pears and wrapped with prosciutto, delicious but expensive, and also the fried ravioli.  Entrees were also good, the table had various pasta dishes, flavors were bright and fresh.  Finally, the cannoli was fantastic, some of the best we have had!  And the gentleman playing the piano and singing was excellent, so we definitely had a great experience."}
{"text":"Service is horrendous! Lunch buffet was cold so we told them to order us cheesesteaks instead. They shrugged off the unsanitary food temperatures like it was no big deal. I love their cheesesteaks! Been a customer since Longhitano days. Very disappointed with the service!!"}
{"text":"This place absolutely rocks....Lunch Buffet for $8.95 M-F, drink and bread included...Simply unbeatable!  True East Coast Italian, wonderful, flavorful sauces, excellent, kind staff and ownership!  Very Clean Restaurant...I really can't say enough great things about this place!  Just go enjoy it, you'll be glad you did..."}
{"text":"I write the occasional review on different restaurants but I don't take pictures of my food before I eat it ..... so...... if you are expecting pictures - it is not going to happen!   Here is the scoop.......this is \"Italian comfort food\" in a cozy & warm environment. The inside of the restaurant looks like you are sitting in a sidewalk cafe somewhere in Italy, in a little town, on a little back street.  The smell of different sauces simmering in the kitchen fill your senses while soft music plays in the background. Regardless of what you order, the food is excellent and you can expect a visit to your table by Mario who will make sure everything was \"okay\". If you want to impress clients, entertain friends or just have an evening out, this is the place!!!   DISCLAIMER:  I am not a family member, I do not own any part of this restaurant and if you take your spouse or friend out for a romantic evening I will not be held responsible for what happens after a glass of wine and a romantic evening at Vinci Torios!! (You are in your own!)"}
{"text":"Meh... Love that it's local and the food isn't usually bad. Just expensive. I feel like I'm in the middle of an identity crisis when I'm there. They want to charge fine dining prices, but operate as a mom and pop. Tonight the service was poor and the \"homemade\" pasta was chewy. Nobody asked so I didn't mention it.  Oh and the bartender/server didn't have her long hair pulled back. Ewww! Whenever I hear \"can I get another one\" from more than a few customers, I realize it's not just me. In this economy going out to dinner is a treat for most... I hate it when restaurants forget that."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, had to wait 30mins with a reservation. Very unaccommodating, my daughter asked for veal cut parmesan, which was not on the menu. After waiting a long time and thinking the food should be there any minute the waitress comes to tell  us that the cook won't  make it. Although they had three different veal disheson the menu. My daughter then chooses another dish asking for anglel hair pasta instead of the linguini. When the check came we couldn't  believe there was a charge. It wasn't  enough that they wouldn't accommodate us the dish we wanted but a charge on top of it for changing one pasta for another. Needless to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"ok, why do I have to be one fo the first low raters.  Heard it was fantastic so we took our SF guests there.  Ordered eggplant parmigiana and eh, it was about as boring as Olive Garden.  Eggplant parm should be sliced thick enough, and cooked so you can TASTE the eggplant.  It shouldn't be thin and overcooked where the breading takes over.  The food was overpriced and wine for $7 a glass--get over yourself.  The atmosphere is ok and the food was ok.   From what I could see on customer's plates, nothing looked especially tempting.  I don't get it.  Maybe I need to try again and order something else. I don't know."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon; it's a very small place. I was actually quiet confused when I first walked into the place because the very first thing I thought was \"Oh, we're in the wrong place.\" When you walk in you immediately see shirts hanging on racks and other things for sale, such as cups, jewelry etc. To me it kind of seemed tacky to be honest. When I walk into a restaurant I expect there to be a host at the front door not shirts.   We were seated right away the place was very slow. There was one other group of people there, other than that it was just us. I loved the look of the restaurant (except for the entrance) it had cobblestone everywhere, wooden tables, and pictures everywhere. You could tell it was a higher end restaurant. We were immediately greeted with a small basket of bread and water. Our waitress then came up and asked us what we wanted to drink, but we just needed more time to think on what we want. The menu is a little on the pricey side. One thing that I have to complain about the waitress was the she was extremely loud. The restaurant was in general a quiet place, played soft music. And the fact that there was only one other table there, the place was just quiet. I remember when she walked into the kitchen (which wasn't far from our table) she was talking about some inappropriate stories to her fellow co-workers. It was just something I didn't want to hear.  Our food came in a reasonable amount of time. I had sausage pizza it was amazing! After we ate we decided to share a cannoli. It was also very delicious. I loved the fact that she could split the bill three separate ways, including splitting the price of the cannoli-not a lot of restaurants can do that.   Overall my experience was pretty good. I was treated well by all of the staff. My waitress was extremely nice, just very loud. She took very good care of us. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Food was exceptional. If I had to rate my experience I'd give it a 7/10.  The only things I can complain about are the confusing entrance and our very loud waitress-overhearing her inappropriate stories. But I did overall really like the food. I will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Went on Winesday and got a fabulous deal on some delicious red wine. Half price all bottles! Love the eggplant dishes, one of the few restaurants that can make a dinner that I couldn't make better at home. I really enjoy checking out the jewelry and accessories they sell in the front too. Great local restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic night here. Mario knows his stuff and he is serving authentic and homemade food across the menu.  We started with tortellini and they were al dente, served with a light and delicious tomato sauce and they had peas! Yum!  We also had a wedding soup that was delicious with meatballs and orzo, and a cup of mushroom cream soup that was rich and velvety.  Since it was our first time we got a wide selection and took most of it home including sausage pizza (perfect crust and homemade sausage), a stuffed pork chop with gnocchi (I'm drooling all over again), and veal Genovese (again cooked delicate with mushrooms and lemon caper artichoke). Don't forget we took half of it home. So Mario came out and told us the background- very cool and friendly. Had to get tiramisu and a mousse. And a homemade lemon cello that looked like it had some local peels added in from his own citrus. Extraordinary."}
{"text":"Love the Italian atmosphere, the FOOD, the owners and employees. Augi is amazing! Take me to Vincitorio's!!  Thank you Vincitorio's for such an experience every time."}
{"text":"What a ripoff. My husband and I have eaten here twice and won't be coming back. The first time was all right; we had just moved to the neighborhood and were happy to find a good Italian restaurant that was clearly popular. Food was decent quality, although nothing that made me crave to come back.   We finally went back again tonight and walked out with an almost $75 tab for two that include entrees, salads, one beer, and tip. I asked the waitress about the special. I was debating between the special and the linguine vongole, and after hearing her describe the special, I asked if it was the same as the fradiavolo on the menu, which was under $20. She said basically it was, and given the fradiavolo was one of the more expensive items on the menu, I assumed the special was around the same. Imagine my surprise when the bill rang up with a $27 special. I know it's my fault for not asking, but it was her fault for not saying it and if there was no difference between the special and an item on the menu except different seafood (fish instead of calamari), then why is the special over 30% more? Even she admitted the specials are overpriced; when we questioned her about it, she said something about the specials \"usually aren't priced very well.\" I think $27 for a bowl of linguine, tomato chunks and spices, a little fish, a couple clams, a couple mussles, and a couple shrimp is ridiculous. The irony is that before the check came, we were just talking about how the food was pretty good but nothing special and the prices were a little steep, so getting the bill just confirmed what we already  knew. We have no problem paying for expensive meals but the return has to be worth it. We won't be going back and can't recommend this place unless you want to see your wallet take a beating."}
{"text":"We have gone to Vincitorio's on many occasions and it always delivers a enjoyable experience. We had our daughters graduation celebration luncheon there today. Everything was perfect. They set up a private buffet in the wine room for us that included salad, three delicious paste dishes. Also included garlic bread and tea or soda pops. Wine and beer was reasonably priced. Highly recommended for all occasions!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is fantastic. Our waiter described the history of the restaurant when we sat down, the wine list was huge and we got to take the rest of the bottle home! I'm a pastry chef, and that tiramisu is the best I have ever had in my life. I will absolutely be going back and telling everyone I know about this place!"}
{"text":"Been enjoying this place for years and they never disappoint! Thank Mario and Ginger for making a true neighborhood restaurant to enjoy with family and friends."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this local Italian restaurant.  When you walk in there are a lot of things for sale, tshirts, jewelry, etc, which I find lessened my impression of the place.  The rest of the restaurant was nice but when you get seated on folding chairs, again, I am not impressed.  When the bread basket was placed on the table, the bread was hot and full of herbs and butter, and was very tasty.  The Italian Wedding Soup however was bland and needed salt.  The main entrees came out and although it was good, it wasnt great, everything was bland."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the restaurant and we'll definitely go back. It was a great experience from the minute we walked into the restaurant until we left. We enjoyed a cocktail at the bar prior to our reservation. Ginger, our server, met us at the bar and took care of us from that moment on! We liked the atmosphere in the bar area so requested seating there. Our dining experience was wonderful from our appetizers through our entree! Everything we ordered was superb. There was live piano music in the bar which was icing on the cake! We are looking forward to taking our visitors for a night out to VinciTorio's!!"}
{"text":"Had a really good meal here last night. Only took away a star due to not making the mozzarella sticks fresh (i had asked and knew, but ordered anyway) and the fact that the butternut squash ravioli dish had way too much sauce and looked more like soup than pasta. Once you sifted through the sauce, the homemade ravioli was quite good. My dish was also ravioli, four cheeses, in a bed of marinara sauce. At least six large clearly homemade ravioli had a nice light filling and a tasty, authentic red sauce. The cream of mushroom soup was great and the salad was fresh and large with good chunky blue cheese dressing on the side. Garlic Bread and foccaccia was served up hot and a free refill was given. About 15 bucks per dish with the soup or salad included. Wanted to try dessert, but who charges 7 bucks for one cannoli. and 8 bucks for a slice of tiramisu?"}
{"text":"This review is for the buffet only.  I was excited to try out an Italian buffet and came for lunch with the boyfriend. The experience was underwhelming but not bad.  For $8.95, you get a soda with refills, a garlic bread basket, access to a salad bar, and three entrees to choose from.  The garlic bread was really good, and my favorite entree was the baked rigatoni! The rustica dish had chicken that was kinda dry and disappointing, but then some pieces of chicken weren't as dry?  I'm pretty certain that if you ordered from the main menu, the dishes would be a lot tastier. I would love it if the buffet had some dessert option too.  Service was superb. Ambiance is nice for a potential date night and the lights are dim.  I would return if I had a hankering for lovingly crafted Italian food, but I'd probably order from the full menu as opposed to the buffet.  I thought the framed police officer uniform on the wall was really cool."}
{"text":"We were in AZ house hunting and our real estate agent suggested this place.  We are glad to have a place we can casually go for yummy calamari.    *Calamari = wonderful....crispy, light, flavored just perfectly *Pasta = pretty good. *Bread = good. *Decor = honestly, it's kinda outdated....but it also gives you the family atmosphere feel. *Service = very nice."}
{"text":"The mussels and bread are TO DIE FOR! Seriously I can't believe I haven't tried this place sooner. Ordered for take out and it traveled well and really was amazing! The pizza is also wonderful. Got the margarita. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We were there on Sat at 6:30 with 2 other couples. 6 total. If you want to be full when you leave, this is the place. But, if you are going out with friends to talk and have a good time- This is not the place. There was music  the night we had dinner.  The server and my friends had to talk over the music.  I believe music should be in the background.  The food was not the greatest.  It was bland.   Other people within the restaurant were having a great time. But, for me, I want to socialize with my friends and not the 2 people supplying the music to have a good time.   Each to their own."}
{"text":"Popped in here again, during our annual ride to the desert.  We split the following:  1. Asparagus wrapped in prosciutto.  Delicious! 2. Caesar salad.  Delicious with homemade dressing. 3. Trofie al pesto.  As good as, maybe better than my own pesto. 4. Panna cotta for dessert.  Delicious. 5. Washed it all down with 14 hands of cabernet.  Very decent table wine.  This place is still our new go to neighborhood joint, for tasty authentic Italian vittles, served up by Mario and his crew.  Grazie caro amico.  Spero di rivederti presto, in moto!!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant! The pastas are delicious and always homemade. Friendly staff. Often fun love music. Separate lively wine bar. We have always had a great meal."}
{"text":"I have had a few meals here that we're just ok and some that we're pretty good, needless to mention we keep coming back. We live nearby and it's probably the best authentic Italian food in the area."}
{"text":"Well.. Apparently this restaurant is not serving the authentic italian food. The food was bit heavy and too much seasoned. Service was good though. On the weekend, there are too many people to get in there, so the tables were jammed.. it feels like I am having dinner with the people sit on the next table."}
{"text":"VinciTorio's is my midscale Italian lunch go-to restaurant. I haven't been there for dinner yet (close to office). His lunch buffet is good, but I prefer ordering off the menu. Everything is very well prepared. They make their tiramisu fresh every morning."}
{"text":"OK the food here is pricey but it is good! This is definitely a sit down with the family type restaurant. The atmosphere is that of Italy with paintings of Europe and Italian decor all over the place. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was great. My only complaint is if your going to be a pricey restaurant at least make the portions a little bigger."}
{"text":"We've been coming here now for about 6 months with the hopes of breaking it in as the go-to nearby family restaurant. The first time was a great experience but it has unfortunately been a consistent and steady downhill slide from there. Whether it be a lackluster dinner dish pleading for additional seasoning or an undertrained (possibly understaffed on a few occasions) server crew, we have unfortunately made the decision that tonight will be our final dining experience at Vincitorio's. I won't pick on any one specific experience as that is hardly enough to deter my family from great food in a comfortable and family friendly environment. Rather, I'll focus on a the apparent carelessness that has become commonplace at a previously we'll run establishment."}
{"text":"Took me too many years to get here and want to return.  Tried out their wine bar. Great Zinfandel. Then a pizza which was delicious.  Next time dinner"}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant I've been to in years. Perfect calamari, great wine selection, tremendous pasta! Our server Marcie was a doll."}
{"text":"We were going to stop at an Italian spot nearby but it was packed and we didn't want to wait so we drove a little ways and happened upon this place which is near the cheap movie theater. Its a nice place with your usual Italian restaurant stereo type.  I had the ravioli carbonara and my girlfriend had the bolognese. She said hers was okay but she is a picky one so don't worry about her, lets worry about me and she can write her own review. Mine was fantastic although the portion could have been larger but its not the fault of the restaurant as I am a bit of a glutton when I like something.   Service was very good and our drinks were always full but the server was not a pest. I didn't go into the bar area but I guess there is wine, women and song there. I will be back without question."}
{"text":"I needed to get out last night, I work from home so some days I get a little Cabin Fever and need out. Last night I wanted to some good ole Italian Comfort Food, and it was not going to be Olive Garden. So I decided to give VinciTorio's a try. The Restaurant was easy to find and park at. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server promptly.  One issue I had was we were seated off in some corner in which we had no view of the dining area and were right in the path of where the service staff comes in and out. I know we had our 2 young children with us, but this corner should not be where you seat paying customers.  I ordered the veal tortellini w/ fresh mushrooms and peas in a tomato cream sauce. Delicious, maybe a bit overpriced at $14, but it came with a small salad.  My husband ordered a Stromboli; it was great and no complaints about the price. The sauce was also delicious.  My 4 1/2 year old had the Rigatoni with Cheese ($3.95) and a salad ($2.95). The cheese was a yellow sauce, weird, and then why so much for a salad for a kid?  The Rigatoni was overdone. I now have the feeling that they really don't want kids there. Put us in a corner, never asked if my son needed a refill, and put no thought into cooking his meal. He is a good kid and did not deserve a bad meal. I will say, he did enjoy his salad.  Here's what was truly lacking: No offer of Fresh Pepper for the Salads No offer of freshly grating Parmesan for the Pasta No offer of Dessert No refills of Water  Will I go back? I don't know, I think I'll be giving Cafe Boa a visit soon, as I felt I could spend the same money but get a lot more."}
{"text":"Our group of four met at Vinci Torio's for dinner on 01/07/2016. No one in our group has dined here before, so it was a new experience. I read the other reviews and thought this would be very good. The main problem took place when our meals were served. What are you served after a hot meal was placed on cold plates that sat for a few minutes before being served? A cooled off or cold meal! Mine as just ok as it was warm but not hot as it should have been. Two others said their meals were warm but lacking that HOT requirement like mine. One friend ordered Veal Marsala that was served COLD. It took some time to get the server's attention. The cold meal was taken away and replaced. However the replacement meal had very tough veal and wasn't eaten. It was removed from the invoice. Maybe other dinners or restaurant owners do not understand that HOT PLATES keeps food HOT. Cold plates robs the heat from what could have been a very good meal. No thanks for a return visit."}
{"text":"Coming from Philadelphia I have a few things to say about good Italian food.   This place is good, but not great, and the price compared to the portion size is not good.  The bread they give you before the meal is very nice and tasty.  The atmosphere is a bit ostentatious;  I going to  guess the clientele have money and they don't treat the wait staff very well, so the wait staff intern are not very friendly.  This is common in these neighborhood higher end restaurants, sad but true.  I can get better Italian for cheaper with a more laid back atmosphere else ware in the valley, but this is a hard combination to find in this area of the county."}
{"text":"This is our go to for quick date nights in the neighborhood. It's the kind of food one would get at a trattoria in Italy. It's authentic and solid. Sadly, I'm in a rut and always order the eggplant parm. The \"special\" tomato sauce is the best. My parter is more adventurous--he usually gets whatever the special is and has always been happy. The Caesar dressing (okay, this part isn't authentic) is addictive and worth the upgrade. The homemade focaccia bread is to die for--don't let your server short you:) The wine list is good and some of it is a bit off the beaten path. The servers are generally not knowledgeable about the wine list sometimes comically so. Me: I'll have a glass of the Barolo. Server: which one? Me: you only have one. Server: Barolo is a type of wine. Me: yes, I'm aware. But you only have one by the glass so that's probably the one I'm ordering. So that was the worst example, but even the good servers here don't know flavor profiles, so you'll be going it alone. Other downsides: you need a reservation on weekends, parking can be a pain with the theater right there, and it is pricey for trattoria food--lunch is much more reasonable. Still, love it. I've lived in Italy off and on and this is as good as it gets in Tempe."}
{"text":"We decided this year to go out for dinner on Christmas Eve rather than cook at home. I made a reservation for this place on a whim after my neighbor told me about it. Thought it was worth a shot as it's tough to find good Italian food out here in AZ. This place blew me away. First the ambiance is awesome. Wouldn't have expected it from a strip mall restaurant. Started off with the calamari for an appetizer.  Freakin amazing. Then ordered the veal parmigiana and was quite possibly the best piece of meat I have ever eaten. So tender that you didn't need a knife to cut it. Melts in your mouth. I'm excited to try the other menu items. We will be regulars for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Italian place in AZ!!!! They make their pasta fresh daily ..... and it's amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here and I had the same special as the reviewer Pamela and I agree with her 100%. Also, I had to remove all the linguini as it was  overcooked. The entire dish consisted mostly of the overcooked pasta with a tiny bit of fish, 2 shrimp, 2 clams and 2 mussels. I'm giving 3 stars because my husband's cheese steak sandwich was very good. The service was also very good as was the ambiance.  Rose"}
{"text":"I have been putting this review off, so time to do it. I am a little behind. But, this is a place that I would go back to any time, and a place I really liked. It is close in the area to us. It is a clean place that smells really good when you walk in. The smell of Italian food cooking fresh is always good. I got the Italian Wedding soup on my last visit. Along with Garlic knots and the Steak Salad. Wow, what a filling meal. It was really good! I am not usally that into the soup when I go out to dinner, but this is worth it. Very good. The salad had a lot of dark lettuce in it. Which is something that we all like. The wine is reasonably priced. Service was great, and the owner even comes to greet you. I like it ,it is a nice place ,and decorated very nice as well. It is good for groups if you call in advance and lots of parking as it is in a shopping center."}
{"text":"FUN! Great wine selection. Music every time I have been there and they even have a movie group in the back room on special nights.  Mario and Ginger are very welcoming and make genuinely great hosts as they make you feel you are in their home sharing a meal. There is something special at this place that you can't quite put your finger on. My kids love it and my husband and I love to go there alone too. Everything is fresh and delightful. Pick anything on the menu- you will be happy."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly recommended by an acquaintance as a real, gourmet Italian dining experience.  Went on a Thursday night.  Got right in, no wait.  Nice ambience.  Service was prompt and attentive, although we did have to ask twice for a fork as my wife's dinner setting did not have one.  Food is really disappointing.  Calamari fritti is frozen calamari and overcooked, chewy.  The sauce that came with it was okay, not outstanding.  My wife ordered lasagna that came with a bit of bolognese sauce  on the side, not cooked into the layers of the lasagna.  A lot of noodles and not much meat.  Sauce tasted okay, though.  I ordered saltimbocca and while the flavor was nice, the meat was paper thin and overcooked, tough.  It came with broccoli that was just steamed, nothing special.  The penne that came with it, I cannot say as I did not try it.  My wife ordered a tiramisu which came as a generous portion and well presented, but lacked any flavors usually associated with tiramisu.  If it were just a nice bit of sweets it would be okay, but it in no way resembled the better tiramisus we have had.  We are world travelers and this meal is sub-par,  even by Phoenix standards.  We have had much, much better meals at Ruffino's and Bucca di Beppo.  While the initial main courses were reasonably priced, the  really get you on the extras, like the dessert, appetizers, coffee and drinks.  With tip we paid $104 for two of us and our main courses were only about $35 together."}
{"text":"I had a stromboli, my husband had a pizza. The stromboli was delicious, the pizza wasn't as good as I had hope for, both dishes were large enough that we could have split them rather than order 2 entrees. You can definitely find better real Italian pizza in Tempe (try Classic Italian Pizza on Baseline/Lakeshore) but the restaurant is very nice and cozy. Our server was attentive and courteous. We really enjoyed our dinner here. Next time we'll try the pasta."}
{"text":"Don't go on Sunday.  First clue should have been \"Open\" sign not on.  The resturant was empty when we got there.  It was freezing.  About 67 degrees.  My huband was cold and asked if they could turn off the airconditioning for a bit, and the server looked at him like he had 2 heads.  She must have told the next person who came to our table because she was very unfriendly and cool.  She took our order and left.  My daughter murmered, \"Wow, they are all kind of snotty here\"   Our food arrived by they failed to bring my 6 year old grand daughters cheese sticks. We told them when they delivered our food, and let her continue to eat the bread and food off of our plates.  After we had eaten our entire meal, the waitress came with the cheese sticks!  No on ever came and checked on our table, or see how we were doing.  After about 20 minutes my daughter went and asked for the check.....  They charged us for the cheese sticks.....never apoligized!  There was not an adult or anyone in charge.  You couldn't pay me to eat there again.  It was so disappointing.  Food wasn't  that great either.... not worth the money.  I can't remember a time when I was treated so terribly.  We will never go back.....  On a good note, the resturant was beautiful,  It was very clean."}
{"text":"Just discovered this Gem... the atmosphere was classy, warm and inviting. From the moment I sat down at the bar to have a glass of wine and look over their menu I was amazed at the service how friendly the staff was. Bartender Warren was awesome  The wine was wonderful and then there was the appetizers. Ordered the Italian Sausage Bruschetta and the Caprese salad amazing!! In fact myself and a few of us are going back to their Saturday night Dueling Pianos really looking forward to it. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is #winning  I don't think I've enjoyed an Italian restaurant more than my friend Victoria's family's spot down in Orange County (the name escapes me) but Vincitorios is uh-may-zing!  Where do I start.... +the staff here are SO freakin nice and knowledgeable about the dishes and wine list.  I met the owners, and let me tell you, Ginger and Mario are so sweet and so passionate about their food, restaurant, and family.   +the wine was delicious.  Between the bf, the bf's boss, and his boss' wife we killed two bottles of wine and both were very smooth and went nicely with what we were eating (1st bottle was a grape I hadn't heard of from Italy and the second was a Malbec from Argentina...I think...somewhere in South America though) +the food was...well I could gladly eat it everyday but I don't think I have the discipline to workout 3x a day!  Mario brought out a prosciutto and mushroom pizza as a thank you for our patience with the wait to be seated and it was very good.  I ordered the gnocchi, which I've never had before, and it was delicious.  The bf and his boss ordered the cioppino-esque dish and they both really enjoyed it.  I had a piece of the seafood on it and it was fresh tasting (something I was worried about being in AZ or any land locked state).  The wife had spaghetti and meatballs and she looked very satisfied.  I completely oinked out and didn't have room for dessert.  When our server came back tiramisu and panne cotta magically appeared in front of me and I succumbed to the tiny voice in my head saying \"c'mon just have a bite, it's not gunna kill ya!\".  I had a few bites and holy crap the two were heavenly! +the decor at quick first glance looks a bit cluttered, but upon second glance you'll see it's actually history on the walls.  There are family photos, shadow boxes, and articles that chronicle (i'm guessing) Mario's family from Italy to the US.  If there's one thing I really like in a family owned restaurant or business is when homage is paid to the relatives before and around that person; basically, respecting your roots. +lastly, when the bf and I walked in to the restaurant the first question was \"how many\" and the second question was \"would you care for a glass of wine?\".....YESSSS.  Any spot that greets me with an offer for a glass of wine is A-OK in my book  Another really cool aspect of this place is that they're going to be putting in a wine bar right next door to the restaurant.  I'm very excited for it to open and look forward to many nights eating and drinking here."}
{"text":"Lunch was very busy and understaffed. Free garlic bread while I waited helped a little bit. Lasagna was good, although if you like a lot of sausage don't get it.  Luckily for me they didn't put much in, because it has a really strong fennel seed flavor, which I despise... My co-worker's cheese steak looked very good (and he said as much) and was a better value overall."}
{"text":"Okay, so it is an Italian restaurant, but all three of us who went together had Philly steak sandwiches!  I know, I know...that seems a little weird.  But my friend had highly recommended them and I'm a sucker for a good one.  It was definitely worth it.  Even though it was not cheesy enough for my tastes, the steak was juicy and perfectly cooked (I didn't have to chew on it too much) and the toppings made for a great combination.    I loved the garlic bread that they brought to us as a complimentary appetizer too...yum!    I'd love to go back and try some of their pasta dishes or even the pizza.  They had a really nice variety but not so much that you struggle to choose from their menu.     The owner or possibly the manager came out and started playing his accordion for one of the tables at one point near the end of our meal.  I highly dislike accordions (you know, that whole polka scene).  But he was amazing on it and had a wonderful singing voice!  I wish he had come out earlier so I could have heard more before we left."}
{"text":"Rodan and I took one of our best friends out for their birthday last night and we all had a great dining experience. We've been coming to this little Italian restaurant for a few years and food and service continue to be 5 star worthy.   Love the soft bread that is served early on. Our friend ordered the Seafood Fradiavolo and thought it was one of the best seafood entrees she ever had. This was actually her first visit. I stuck with my fave: the potato pizza. Yum! I ordered the medium pizza and happy that half of the pizza was brought home as leftovers. Save room for a dessert...you won't be disappointed!  This is by far my  fave Italian restaurant in Phoenix. Cheers!"}
{"text":"It was a really nice atmosphere and the food was very good however we were not prepared for the price tag on the dishes. There are very limited selections for vegetarians and for plates under $20.   Maybe the cost reflection was due to the \"special\" Mother's Day menu?   I don't know about you but as an average person I was not prepared to drop $100 for a dinner for four and still have to feed my kids afterward because the portion sizes are not very big, they are just enough for one person. (PLUS I split my entree with my boyfriend)   The prices were not posted for any of the beer or wines and I doubt we will return just because of the sticker shock."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is charming and the ambiance is cheerful. Service was consistent. Unfortunately the food was just okay to us.   They bring garlic bread to the table that was simple. Nothing bad or remarkable. The fried cheese sticks are made with beer batter which seemed odd to us in an Italian restaurant.   The Caesar salad has a house made dressing that is unique - heavier than traditional dressing with a zesty spin. It's heavy with cheese. Good but just a bit too heavy for our preference.    I had the chicken scarpata. I'm a huge lover of chicken piccata. It's similar minus capers but with a spicy kick. It's served with a couple florets of broccoli and a side of bow tie with marinara sauce. Again. It was good but nothing unique or special.   My husband had the cheesesteak hoagie with house chips (we were told fries are like Burger Kings by the waiter, which didn't sound good). The chips were plain, not much flavor or salt. The sandwich had really good meat and cheese on it it he didn't prefer the Italian dressing on it.   All in all, it's a cute place with quality food, it comes down to preference. The flavors here aren't our preference."}
{"text":"Mediocre food,  the red sauce on my gnocchi was basically chunks of watery tomatoes.  The dish was lukewarm at best.   My husband had the eggplant which was also so-so.  I guess we might be a bit prejudice when it comes to Italian food since we lived in Italy for three years and became spoiled.  The waitress was wonderful and charming, but there was a very boisterous accordion player that would NOT leave us alone.   He stayed between our table and another for over an hour.   Therefore conversation with our guests was nearly impossible to hear.  The best part about him is when he stopped and took a break!  This was our second time here, andI don't think we will be going again."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday for the first time .... the service was horribly slow.... the food was decent but the server messed up our order then proceeded to charge us for add ons that we didn't even have. Tried to charge us for a side salad that he told us was included and charged us almost 4$ for substituting a sauce (something you probably want to mention). It was a cute environment but they need help with the service for sure, don't blindside people with charges for every little thing."}
{"text":"Lived across the street from here for almost 10 years and never thought to stop in. Well, last night i visited for the 1st time with a group of Girl Scout moms. WOW! I've been missing out! Lets start with the atmosphere. It felt cozy, decor was gorgeous, and everyone was so friendly. Now the food/drinks. We were able to sample the salads, ziti, meatballs, and several different pizzas. This was original italian food. All of it was amazing. The selection of wine was gigantic! Our group was over 20 people and I didn't hear 1 complaint.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came here on whim... Just saw it had some decent reviews on yelp.  We chose to check out the bar area to see if we could grab a seat, since it was our 1st time we realized there were tables as well as a bar top. There wasn't enough space at the bar for the two of us, but there was a women who was attempting to squeeze us in... Come to find out she and the man next her were the owners. Now she was very accommodating however I hate seeing the people operating an establishment taking up space for potential customers. We grabbed a table sat there for a little over 5 mins before a server greeted us. The busser had been there twice before the server had come by. Annoying. We ordered a bottle of wine and a small pizza immediately. It took about 25 mins for that small pizza to arrive at our table, but not before we saw our server holding while she was talking to other tables ... Thanks for continuing to keep us waiting. The pizza was bland and had been sitting around for a while.  We order that rest of our food and some extra bread...... Our food just seemed to take forever. Salads came out... No bread. For $16 entrees the portions we quite small... I was actually surprised it came out hot! Home made pasta was really good I'll give them that, but the service was horrible. Our server was at the table behind us talking up a storm about some nonsense (considering she was working) we watched the hostess come Over an tell her another table was waiting on her to run their card. Lovely. She just continued doing what she doing... Never once checked on us during our meals. I've been in this industry far too  long to put up with stuff like this. Especially considering we eat the same meals a mile from where we live (homemade pasta included) with bigger portions, better service and a lower price.   However their bar does look very nice. I did like the decor a lot. They also have a huge wine selection."}
{"text":"Excellent! Whoever said u can't have good Italian outside NY hasn't eaten here. We were blown away by the food, the atmosphere, and the friendliness and knowledge of the staff. We live in Central Phoenix but this is totally worth the 25 min drive!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We will be a repeat visitor to this place. Since we moved to south phoenix, we have been on the look out for a great Italian restaurant that is closer than our previous favorite (Vito's - Lindsey/Mckellips...bit to far to drive that frequently) While this is not super close, it is closer than vito's....but I digress....  Anyhow... we tried Vinci Torio's on a recommendation from a current customer - and we were not disappointed.  This place serves hearty, comfort food - pastas, veal, chicken. With red sauces. There were multiple, multiple options to choose from, which is rare for me - usually I only find 1-2 options on a menu. They were more than happy to make any veal dish a chicken dish - and said so happily. The wine selection is great -- highly recommend the Fantini Farnese, Sangiovese  (and not because it rolls off the tongue so nicely :)) The salad was perfect, real lettuce, yeah!! (not weeds), and the house Italian was very tasty. They serve hot garlic bread, yum, as the bread on the table.  We had Chicken Genovese (sauce was tasty and love the mushrooms and artichokes) and Cavatelli Al Forno (pasta in light meat sauce baked with ricotta and moz) -- the pasta was al denti, nice and good flavor. Can't wait to try something else.  A bonus.... they have live music on different nights, so looking forward to experiencing that.  Tip...sit in the bar -- great atmosphere with all the wine and custom made furniture.  Someone wrote it was like sitting in a little caf√© in Italy in some back street, .. yes, it was and it was a lovely experience.  p.s. - 1/2 of bottles on Wednesday's :)"}
{"text":"The service was not great and a bit slow.  However, the food for than made up for it.  YUM!  I had a salad with jalapeno ranch and then the butternut squash ravioli.  It was so good that I can't wait to go back and get it again.  We were lucky enough to hear the waiter singing Happy Birthday in Italian while we were there and that was a treat.  Oh, I would skip the pineapple, chantilly cream cake we had for dessert.  I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian place hands down. Mario and Ginger will treat you right. The food is excellent and  the environment is awesome. Try to attend on a night when the have dueling pianos or live music. They'll always make reservations for you; just be ready to wait.  They've added more space so you can hold a large party in the back.  They've also added another room to the side. If you like bread, you won't be disappointed either."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The girls found that Wednesdays are just plain wonderful, with their food and wine deals... Delicious pizza and the half price bottles of wine can't be beat... Can't wait to go back.  The owners are friendly, welcoming and inviting."}
{"text":"Food was really truly great! All made from scratch. Wine selection is good. We had reservations but arrived early and they had a table ready for us.  Cozy atmosphere and good wait staff.  The cream of mushroom soup is amazing! Tiramisu for dessert (all from scratch)."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, the entrance is a little cramped and you have to do a little waiting if you come in for dinner with no reservation. Either way, my wife and I love this place, the food is great and the service is stellar. Great atmosphere I love going to this place."}
{"text":"VinciTorio's is great for many reasons.  First it has a great atmosphere, the tables, the lighting, the music all help set the mood very well.  I usually use my wife's ice team glass as a barometer as to how attentive the staff is to patrons and her glass was always full.  The food is wonderful and much better than the Olive Garden type fare that seems to be popular with many Italian restaurants these days.  A great choice for Italian food in Tempe."}
{"text":"The service is pretty darn good. The wine selection is always top notch... but they lost me on the food!  Understand, I have frequented this place since we moved into the area a few years ago. I was a big fan of the handmade pasta and pesto. But is seems as if the focus on the food has slipped, and substantially at that.  I'm giving three stars because of our server, Dave. He rocks. And the wine list, pretty much rocks. I haven't checked out the new wine bar, but it looks real nice.  But, as for a meal. I'd be surprised if I go back...  ... and I am tempted to take that down to two stars... yeah... I have to give it a meh."}
{"text":"Very good..the wait to be seated and then get our food was rather long. Food portions are perfect!! No food goes to waste yet you are mildly full..not overstuffed..will come back!"}
{"text":"First timers........loved it. Very Charming place.  Sat at the bar, my favorite Hop Knot on tap. Fried Ravioli, was great. Chicken Scarpara was great Wife had the cheese steak salad, awesome.  We can't wait to come back. The decor is 2nd to none, we'll be back."}
{"text":"In short an unimpressive independent Italian restraint in a overly Italian saturated area.  Over the years this location has changed names and ownership many times, and I decided to give the current iteration of this place a try. The inside has gone upscale, with frescos on the wall, table cloths, and an accordion player. The empty buffet setup by the window did not quite match.  The menu has \"hand made pastas\" and many traditional dishes, pizzas, sandwiches and strombolis.   Included with a main dish is a side salad with choice of dressing and garlic bread. I opted for the ravioli de zuca 15.95, butternut squash ravioli in a white cream sauce. I was hoping the gorgonzola the menu listed would be more pronounced however it was not. The filling was quite sweet, the pasta was a bit soft and the meal was luke warm at best when it reached my table. The side salad was good with a nix mix of greens and I had a unique jalapeno ranch that was thin and light.   The people I was with ordered a rolled eggplant filled with ricotta cheese (13.95), it came with pasta and veggies. Texturally it was a bit soft and the flavors were weak.   Portion sizes were on the medium side, not huge, but not terribly small, for the price and quality I would have expected more. The garlic bread that is in included is good, as is the on table parmegean cheese, red pepper, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  There are other better options within 3 miles so I say give them a try first."}
{"text":"I came here on Valentine's day. Unfortunately, the atmosphere was less than romantic. We were elbow to elbow with another couple. They crammed in as many two tops as possible, and doubled the prices on their menu, in honor of this day of love. It was obvious their only concern was gaining as much revenue as possible, at the expense of their guests.   The food was awful. I feel bad saying that, but it is the best description. I had the veal. It tasted like a microwave dinner. The noodles were over cooked and mushy. How does that happen at an Italian restaurant? As a cook, I expect better, especially when I'm paying through the nose. I didn't come out on Valentine's day to rub elbows with somebody that I don't know. Horrible experience, will never visit again."}
{"text":"Absolutely enjoy eating at this restaurant every single time I visit. So far I have tried their eggplant parm, calzones, and fried ravioli appetizer.  Te quality and price of the food is reasonable."}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant!!! Did not expect this at all! We made reservations for 6p on Friday. I said we had 2 crazy kiddos, and we didn't want to disrupt anyone, so they made sure we had a table in the cozy back room past the bar area. The hostess was just a delight and the waiter..SPOT ON. Water always filled, check! Extra bread, check! Polite and attentive staff...check, check, check! Food was pretty good, honestly needed salt on all our meals and in the wedding soup, but hey...they have salt on the table - so we used it! I got the butternut squash ravioli, aside from needing salt, very yummy. Its a very clean place, you can make it a romantic environment or casual like we did with the kids. They had nice guy playing piano, a little 'sparkly' gift shop/walkway to the right when you come in. Decor seemed very well kept and seemed 'authentic Italian' as you could for being in Tempe! :o) Prices were standard for this type of food. Affordable. We will definitely be returning! Fantastico! *We did notice they have a very large and adorable patio when the weather is nicer. So we'll try that too! **Btw, I dont give 5 stars often, so even though slightly 'off' on the food...the service was so good, it allowed us to enjoy our company a heck of a lot more."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to dine here for our daughters 16th birthday on Valentine's Day. We were served fairly fast, our waitress was courteous but for me the food was not what I personally expected. The penne was okay but the SaltimBocca alla roman was not to my liking. I feel bad writing this, but it's My honest opinion and i would like to come back and give it another go, possibly order another dish. The bread was top notch as well as the ambiance and service."}
{"text":"I have brought my family here on average once a month for a few years now. Vincitorio's is a classy joint, with great food, drink, _service_, and excellent musicians. The owners, who are usually there working, have paid great attention to detail in the decor. The specials are always tasty and it's my favorite pizza in town. Augie the accordion player is a virtuoso musician, and Sarah the singer has a great voice. Both of them add immensely to the ambiance. Some of the servers have been there for years and are friendly and efficient. Try to get reservations later on in the week, because it gets busy!"}
{"text":"Have been going and sending others to their luncheon special for they offer salad and 3 different pasta dishes for a great pricee."}
{"text":"I am normally a real fan of VinciTorio's.  I don't get over there much as it is a bit of a hike for us.  We decided it had been too long since we had been there so we gave it a go on Saturday night.    The food is very good here.   I will say that the sauce was a bit tasteless on this night and I was surprised.  It is normally nice and tangy but it was a bit bland which is not the norm here.  We started with the bruschetta which is always very tasty.  My husband had the veal tortellini which was delicious and I opted for the chicken parm.  In the past, they have always been able to accommodate me with doing veal parm instead of chicken but I was a bit disappointed to find out they can't do that anymore.  I understand why but I wish they would put it on the menu because it is so good.  The chicken farm was tasty but the penne was a bit watery so there was a lot of water on my plate.  The wine list is nice and there are some nice options to choose from.  Service is pretty good but the nicest thing is to see the owner is always there.  This is a nice restaurant for a date night or a meal with friends."}
{"text":"I recently went to dinner here with a friend. He thought he remembered this place being amazing. Unfortunately, the service was horrible. It took over 20 minutes to just get drinks and another 10 or so to finally order. Once the food got there, it was wrong. We decided to eat it as is anyway and it was just super bland and just not good :( While it was nice trying something new, I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"We are first timers at this establishment. We came here last night as a party of six with reservations and the place was packed. I would highly recommend making reservations if you want to dine here. Even though we had reservations we still had to wait 20 minutes before we could sit. The service at VinciTorios is impeccable. They will greet you at the door and they will make sure they say goodbye when you leave. The waitstaff are trained very well. It's like dining in an upscale restaurant. The service is stellar from the host stand to the back of the house. Excellent job VinciTorio! The place has a nice cozy feel to it. The food was good, it wasn't excellent but good. Some of the dishes lacked salt and flavor. We would recommend the fresh baked pizzas, spaghetti meatballs and the pork loin. Overall, we would come back to VinciTorios."}
{"text":"Took my son out for his birthday dinner with 6:30pm reservations.  I told them it was a birthday celebration but they never acknowledged it.  By 7pm it was packed, a piano player and a Friday evening combination.  The chairs were all wood and no padding.  After 30 minutes my poor butt began complaining and by the hour it was quite painful.  Our appetizer \"fried calamari\" was crisp, tender and super bland.  Lots of salt and pepper couldn't redeem it.  The basket of bread was at best, fair.  We both ordered Seafood Fradiavolo, described on the menu as \" mussels, clams, shrimp and calamari over linguine in our spicy marinara\".  Fairly nice portion of the seafood, cooked well but so bland as to have little taste.  The linguine were cooked al dente and obviously not house made.  Lemon juice, salt, pepper and grated parmagiano cheese couldn't redeem these dishes either. I ate about half this dish when normally I would devour it all.  If only they would season their dishes, they used to be much better.  The marinara sauce tasted like straight tomato sauce, sigh.  The wait staff were friendly, pleasant and efficient.  Between the piano playing and everyone speaking loudly there was a roar in the room.  I could have possibly endured the uncomfortable chairs if my ears hadn't hurt as well.  I doubt very much that I would return."}
{"text":"We have been going to Mario and Ginger's place for some time and love it.  It's a lot of Italy with a family atmosphere and the food is always perfect.  We did a family event in their reserve room and the food and service was wonderful.  The room has a projector for movies or special events.  Going again tonight!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places!  The food was great and they had a really good wine selection. It was reasonably priced too. The staff was super friendly. We went on 4th of July which just happened to have rained and was only 80 degrees so we wanted to sit outside. It wasn't set up so they set it up just for us. It's a good vibe, and I loved the way they decorated it. They made the patio feel kind of secluded from the parking lot, stores and street, but still get some nice sunshine in. We went inside and looked at the wine bar side and it looked really fun too. I definitely will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meal last night.  Great service, delicious food.  Ordered the bruschetta as appetizer, butternut squash ravioli and spaghetti Bolognese.  We loved our food.  Cute & cozy atmosphere with live accordian player/singer.  Will definitely be back to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered a Penne pasta with eggplant. Tasted okay -ish. Heavily stuffed with cheese and olive oil.   Go give it a try."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. But the stromboli aka calzone had no flavor. I think what I dont like is the sauce. It had a weird flavor to it. The gf said too much basil but that was not it.  The fresh bread was wonderful. They have a very cool patio. I will have to try again something different. But I thought the stromboli was terrible. Kind of soggy after the water drained all over the bottom of the plate.  Why it has water is curious. I should have got a pizza I guesss. But the sauce scares me. Next time I will try homemade pasta."}
{"text":"3.5 stars with room to improve!  Recently had a lovely dinner at VinciTorio's with Yelp pals Jim and Audrey W.  Although there was a problem with our reservation not being carried over from one notebook to another (huh?), it was easily corrected with a short (well maybe not so short) wait.  While waiting, I caught a glimpse of their patio which looks very promising for a future visit.  Once seated, we were soon greeted with tasty garlic bread.  I'm sure at some point, they considered charging us for the bread given our repeated requests for refills!  Our server was not only knowledgeable about the menu, but very familiar with the wine list as well.  When I asked for a description of my chosen Verdicchio, his description was spot-on and I was not disappointed.  I was somewhat disappointed with my entree, Salmon & Shrimp Vincitorio's.  Described as \"Fresh Atlantic salmon filets and jumbo shrimp, sauteed with mushrooms, leeks, in our light cream sauce with a touch of tomato, served over fettuccine,\" I was a little surprised to find more than a touch of tomato.  It was more of a tomato cream sauce, although still light and very good.  The fettuccine was delicious even though I don't believe this particular pasta is hand-made.  My complaint is with the seafood. The salmon filets were actually pieces of filet which would have been okay had they not been so dry.  The jumbo shrimp consisted of 3 shrimp which were also slightly overdone.  At $19.95, this may have been the priciest item on the menu, but probably was not the best.  Dessert was definitely the star of the show.  The tiramisu was not only a generous portion, it was fantastic.  The panna cotta was smooth and creamy, with no gelatinous texture.  The gelato covered in a chocolate shell was liked a gourmet version of a DQ dip cone.  This was probably my favorite.  I would return to VinciTorio's for the desserts alone!"}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed with their Italian dishes.  Their pizza is pretty good, but the pasta seemed bland.  I was expecting better based on the reviews I'd read."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood over 15 years, but had never stopped by. I knew it was an Italian restaurant, and I had heard so-so reviews, so I thought - why bother, when there are so many other good Italian restaurants in the Valley. Stopped by about 3-4 months ago, and I was greatly impressed. The \"Enoteca\" wine bar next to the restaurant is so cute and inviting. The ambiance is reminiscent of someone's wine cellar - dark, cool, and a little funky. Great happy hour prices on wine and their signature flatbreads and bruscettes - $6.00 each. I've also tried their white pizza - which is one of the best white pizza's I've had. The \"Enoteca\" can get a little crowded around happy hour - and just a note - happy hour prices do not extend into the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ahhh - as an Italian from New York, I have been on a search for good Italian food since moving here 38 years ago.  I think VinciTorio's is it.  My go-to dish is always eggplant parm.  The eggplant was thin, not soggy.  Not greasy.  Just enough mozzarella.  The sauce - well, it was LIGHT, not heavy, bitter tomato sauce.  The chunks of tomato were sweet (spoke with chef and owner - he uses fresh Roma tomatoes). The pasta was perfect - not so al dente that you crunched your pasta, but not mushy like it had been sitting in water forever.  The garlic bread was hot and had a nice crunch to it.  My house dressing on the salad was okay - nothing to distinguish it and disappointing.  Maybe use kalamata olives instead of regular black olives.  Service was excellent.  Restaurant was crowded, make reservations.  Wednesday is 1/2 price bottle of wine.  We will try again, with different dishes and see how it holds up in a repeat!"}
{"text":"Eating here makes me happy.  I recommend the Tiramisu* Mascarpone cream blended with fine italian liqueur over sponge cake covered by a layer of espresso drenched lady fingers, dusted with cocoa powder.  I recommend the lunch buffet.  I'm going to make reservations for the jazz night."}
{"text":"Very comfortable place to dine, sit at the bar or have a special event. Homemade food that's authentic. Great service and also some wonderful gifts to take home with you. Get the pizza, homemade pasta, and tiramisu.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it because I am a huge fan of Philly's Famous in Chandler; but, VinciTorio's Cheesesteak Hoagie is better!  Typically I would never order a Cheesesteak Sandwich at a nice Italian Restaurant, but boy am I glad I did today.  I wasn't in the mood for pasta (which they have an \"all you can eat\" buffet that looked delicious!), so I defaulted to a sandwich.  Now, I'm not saying definitely order the Cheesesteak; but, if you really like them and you are not in the mood for one of their many other fantastic entrees, then give it a try!  Trust me when I tell you, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm only rating the food... I got a ToGo order.   I love supporting local / family owned places but I must be honest with my reviews.  I would have given them 3 stars but the Lasagna was HORRIBLE. ... It was simply a pile of pasta sheets (like 7-8) with one 1\" wide, half inch thick strip of sausage on one end and a small amount of cheese in 2 or three layers.  So either the chef has NO CLUE what Lasagna is - thus he/she needs to go a google search - or they were cheap azzez ripping off customers. If I was sitting in the place I would have sent it back without blinking.  Also ordered was Pasta Prinavera (pretty good) and a Stromboli which was good, worth ordering again.  In all I'd rally like to give this place another try but I feel cheated by the pile of pasta sheets they charged me for calling it Lasagna. So, I have not decided if I will give them another shot or not..."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite Italian food restaurant in the Phoenix area!! I only come here every so often but each time I do come the food and the service is exceptional. The staff here are amazing and they truly do treat you like family.   The food and the wine is always perfect. Again the staff is crucial here, each time they have paired my food with a perfect glass (or two) of wine. I always recommend the special if they have one! Every single time in the 5+ years I have come here I've never had over cooked pasta. It's always al dente. Also the bread basket is to die for.   The decor is very cute and the actual dining room is a bit small but cozy. I truly feel this place deserves 6 stars for how great it is!   Perfecto!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine met MT who plays guitar here on Friday and Saturday nights and wanted to hear him play, so I agreed to accompany her to VinciTorio's this past Saturday. She pitched it as a \"deli\" so I totally did not expect table linens and homemade orecchiette! Turns out the chef is from the same region in Italy as my maternal grandmother (Puglia). I remember making orecchiette with her when I was a little girl. It's one of my favorites, so of course I had to chose that for my entree.   Orecchiette (\"Priest Ears\" or \"Little Ears\") are little hat or ear shaped pasta that do a fabulous job of storing sauce. I have not yet tried the red sauce at VinciTorio's (part of the reason I can't commit to five full stars) since this orecchiette was topped with olive oil, garlic, broccolini, ground sausage and pecorino cheese.  It was delicious!    Entree prices ranged from $12-20 and come with soup or salad. The wine list had some good selections. I especially liked the pinot nero \"Terre di Gioia\" which was only $7/glass! (I also had the panna cotta for dessert. It was good, but a little too heavy on the raspberry puree.)   And, we got to enjoy all of this with live acoustic guitar renditions of classic Eagles and Tom Petty... not what you expect to hear on the streets of Monopoli, but easy on the ears, anyway! Based on their web site, it looks like they host some pretty cool events... like the upcoming Italian dinner and a movie night.  I'm looking forward to returning and trying some sauce to make a final assessment; although, by the crowd of people waiting in the parking lot when we left, I'm guessing it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that is so consistently good, I've nearly taken it for granted. It's also tucked away in a corner and not easily visible from Elliot or McClintock - so it's easy to pass by.  I can always count on friendly hosts,  pleasant and effective wait staff, and tasty food. I don't like calling it \"safe\", but I can take a group with disparate palettes here and be sure everyone will find something they like.  My favorite dish is the Cannelloni Rossini. Wonderful flavor and texture. I think it could use a little \"kick\", but it is certainly NOT bland.  This place stays pretty busy in the evenings so make a reservation or relax on the patio for a short wait."}
{"text":"My good friend Marcie serves here and has been trying to get me to try out the restaurant for a while now. My wife and I went for the lunch buffet today. It was very affordable at $8.95. The food was amazing! We will be back for sure! We finished or meal and asked for the check, to our surprise Marcie had called in to let our server know that we are celebrating our 5-year anniversary this week. Steven brought us a piece of tiramisu to celebrate. Honestly it was the best tiramisu I have ever eaten. My wife is normally not the biggest fan of tiramisu but she loved it as well.   For anyone in the mood for some fantastic Italian food I would definitely recommend VinciTorio's. Ask to sit in Marcie's section in the wine bar. You will not regret it. She is awesome!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. One thing I can say is, a very small restaurant but hey that's no problem because their food makes up for it! Their service is one point. Portion size is huge, so be prepared to eat up! This place is good for about 4-6 parties if bigger good luck fitting everyone. The noise level is quiet but romantic. I would recommend this place for first time fathers, couples or just a place to eat some real Italian food. Their food price is fair, we spent about 150-200 for 6 people which I think is reasonable. We came here for my brother's birthday dinner, the only downer is that they couldn't even provide like a birthday dessert in the house? They didn't even offer which I thought was bizarre usually most restaurants offer complimentary desserts for birthdays, there I give it a 4."}
{"text":"The ambience is warm and friendly. The mushroom soup is the best I've ever had! You can taste that the Caesar salad is homemade and it's delicious."}
{"text":"We so wanted to like this restaurant but didn't.  The best part was our table was waiting for us when we arrived.  We felt rushed to the point we had to ask Adam to slow things down.  There was a table of 4 people 3 tables away from us and one of the men was SO LOUD that we could barely hear each other. We heard about his aunt and Kenny, etc. ad nauseam.  Read previous reviews about how great the food was, \"Best pizza ever\" so one of our party ordered one with anchovies, mushrooms, black olives and onion.  It had absolutely no taste at all plus the cheese was yellow and it appeared to have been sitting under the salamander along with our other meals for quite a while. Worst pizza ever!  My eggplant parmigiana was mediocre at best, my friend liked her lasagna but the salmon and shrimp dish was not good and the Calamari also had no taste. Even salt couldn't help it.  First and last time going there."}
{"text":"Went for first time and was seated in the bar area.   The waitress said it was a brand new addition.  It was gorgeous and had old world charm.  Felt like Italy.  Pizza was excellent and the sea bass was off the charts good.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Okay little place,prices are good,quality average,service is good,staff friendly.Parking is bad for it sits near Pollacks Tempe Bargain movie house ,so you have to fight for a spot.Potato chips are awful ,super hard and crunchy.Temperature of food was nice and hot.I wouldn't drive out of my way to go there but okay for lunch before a movie."}
{"text":"We visited yesterday for Happy Hour and we were very impressed. There were a ton of appetizer options on the HH menu--we ordered the fried mozzarella, meatballs with crostini, mozzarella piccolo, fried ravioli, and a Caesar salad (which wasn't on HH but was reasonably priced). All of our food was fresh and tasty, especially the salad. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and it had a nice, romantic vibe. Also, our waitress did a great job--she checked on our table the right amount. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Called in an order around 5:30. Was quoted 15 minutes... Took 27 minutes. Totally not a big deal but it just would've been nice if I'd had a more accurate time so I could've gone to store before rather than sitting in their charming waiting area... and I mean that sincerely! The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming! But it started to lose its charm almost 15 minutes later...  I attempted to order garlic knots but apparently they aren't offered anymore. Might want to take them off website... Anyway, ordered the pizza Kate M ordered because it looked awesome in her pictures, I'll have to get the name and update.   The dough had totally over proofed and made the crust so thin and sadly limp that the toppings literally slid off. It was incredibly disappointing! I had ordered a pizza a couple months ago and wasn't impressed but I always try to give it another try before totally writing it off.  I am definitely coming back for a sit down wine and bread experience but I'll never order a pick up again.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Clean, crisp atmosphere. A true neighborhood, non-chain restaurant that wraps you in its personality from the very minute you walk in. Service is cordial without being overly friendly. Wine selection is outstanding and a few beers --yes, Italian beers available. I tried their Birra Moretti, and enjoyed its robust taste. The Menu is nice and balanced. Try their homemade pasta. I tried their fish special and was not disappointed. As with some of Italian dishes, they are not low-fat. Indeed quite rich and saucy. A good, solid Italian restaurant indeed. Nicely priced too."}
{"text":"Came here with a total party size of 14 people.   Celebrated a recent graduation.   Great service,  good food,  great atmosphere.   If you're a wine or beer lover,  you have plenty of drinks to choose from.   They even have the two graduates at our table some killer looking desserts,  on the house.   I'm sure we will be back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Happy Birthday Mairo. You and your restaurant rocks! Still the best food, service and happiest place to dine. You are loved.. Steve & LIz"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant one rainy summer night.  This is one place that my whole family can agree on.  There is a large variety of items to please everyone.  Stromboli is very good as well as the pizza.  My favorite menu item is the mushroom soup.  It is the best soup I have had in a very long time.  I have tried several of the dinner entrees and none have been a disappointment.  They are currently only serving beer and wine and waiting on their liqueur license.  Service has always been good.  On our last visit, Chad our server , was very attentive.  When he was not around,  there was a young woman who refilled our drinks and brought us anything we needed."}
{"text":"The decor inside is very dated! Wine selection is lacking but the food is good for sure."}
{"text":"Good italian food, nice atmosphere and very friendly owners and staff.  The owner makes the pizza (among other items on the menu) from scratch and it's phenomenal! Best pizza I, and my family, has ever had. We do go for the delicious pasta...and chocolate cake...and vino...but you can't pass up the pizza.   Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Great Food and Great Staff! I work right near this place and visit often, the lunch buffet is great as well as most other dishes that I have eaten."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Vincitorio's for years. It is a great place eat. Last night we had a group of 16 with us to enjoy the dueling pianos!! He had a blast!!"}
{"text":"Read the other reviews, particularly the one about some dude's brother having been in Italy etc, and decided to try it last night.  Garlic bread was nothing special and iced tea was that Gold Peak stuff, which is fine for Silvermine Subs but not what you'd expect from an allegedly great Italian place. Had the Cannelloni for main dish and it was absolutely bland. Claimed be served in bechamel sauce but it was more like Alfredo.  Waitress was nice but that doesn't make a tasteless $18 dish worth the money or the calories.  Maybe other stuff is better but I seriously question peoples' reviews.  If you have a refined palette for genuine Italian food, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is casual and friendly, I liked it you will too.  The Wedding soup was perfect, it tasted homemade, not at all salty which we loved. I ordered the egg plant parmesan.  The sauce was runny but good, I was surprised how thin the egg plant was.  My boyfriend had the veal parmesan w/mushrooms his sauce was also runny.  The veal was overly tenderize it fell apart, the mushrooms were not special.  Wait, wait I'm not done....... For deserts the Panama cotta is homemade HERE in house, all the other desserts are ordered in.  It was awesome & for those of us who are diabetic this dessert is good, but you have to share.   Over all I give this place a good 3.5 do come and try it for yourselves.   Olivia"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in the entire valley. Anytime someone wants a restaurant recommendation, Vincintorios is top of the list. Their mushroom soup is a can't miss. Not canned brand, home made from scratch and you can tell in every last drop. We always enjoy a small pizza for appetizer because it's that good. Real authentic back east Italian. If you're around for new year's Eve dinner, it is a limited menu of some of their best options and a great, even keeled party complete with a live piano player. Tons of fun."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very good meal with a cozy, if a bit cluttered, ambiance. Service was timed well - not intrusive. Our meal came with a choice of either soup or house salad with the entree. Bread basket was enjoyable. The grated cheese in a shaker on our table was extremely good - soft & buttery. Italian wedding oup was good & the salad was average but on the larger size. My partner loved Veal Genoese - veal was tendered, well saut√©ed & fresh lemony flavor. My Chicken Parm was very enjoyable & the accompanying cavatelli was good as well as the homemade red sauce.  Only negative is that it was extremely cold because of the combo of AC & ceiling fans at full tilt. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Italian restaurant!  The staff is great and the wine bar is a fantastic addition.  We have been long time regulars and consider Vincitorio's a second home.  The wine list is excellent and they have something for every price range."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try for a nice quiet Valentine's Day lunch with my guy.  We sat on the patio which is lovely.  Very charming with lots of plants and corks for mulch.  Cute.  The garlic bread they bring out was amazing.  Very light and soft, but oh so good....and they just kept bringing more!  We had the fried ravioli, my personal fave, and it was delicious!  The BF had a stromboli which was recommended by our waitress.  He said it was really good, but it looked more like a calzone to me.  I thought a stromboli was a rolled up kind of pizza thing, but this was folded over like a calzone.  Either was he liked it.  I had the caprese sandwich which I though was really good.  It was on the same type of bread they make the garlic bread from, lightly toasted with tomatoes, mozzerella and pesto.  Upgraded from the chips to the fries on the recommendation of our server and they were quite tasty.  We're anxious to go back and try some different menu items, but we definitely enjoyed our lunch"}
{"text":"Wednesday half-off wine night, delicious fried ravioli, and delicious thin-crust pizza (generous for a medium) with prosciutto, which was even better the next day. The service was excellent, and the outdoor seating area, with red and white table cloths right out of \"Lady & the Tramp,\" was simply charming.  It was the perfect find for the first night in an unfamiliar town, right after getting off a plane.  Thanks, Yelp!"}
{"text":"Today, I went grocery shopping and was going to make up a nice, light dinner for my roommate, C, (it was his birthday) but instead, we ended up at VinciTorio's restaurant. Well, I have to say... it was delicious, just as he promised it would be!  As we walked into the restaurant, I was greeted by both a nice hostess and... the alluring smell of fresh baked bread.  As I looked around, I saw a lovely, cozy restaurant and... a man hand-making pasta!  (I made sure to order from the fresh pasta part of the menu.)  The pleasantness continued as the dinner wore on.  Our server was extremely polite and efficient, the bread and my lasagna were great and C really enjoyed his dish too.  I forgot what it was called but it's from the owner's part of Italy and has a lot of bell peppers. haha.   By the end, we had nice left-overs to take home and were still too full for dessert.  Ah well, maybe next time!  Oh and, dinner for 2 with non-alcoholic drinks was just under $40 before tip. :-)  See ya there!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and terrific staff.. One of our \"Special\" spots to have some great Italian food..."}
{"text":"Update as of 7/3/2013, also known as my 21st birthday.  Tonight was amazing. I make it no secret that VinciTorio's is probably my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona, so I had high expectations coming in with my parents and girlfriend for my birthday. I was not let down.  The bruschetta was as fantastic as before, and everyone agreed on that. My first ever adult drink was their Cardoni (I believe, as I'm now home writing this review trying to remember, ha!) I got the mushroom soup as my dinner starter and was blown out of the water. It was honest to god some of the best soup I've ever had in my life.  I had the Chicken Saltimbocca (again, guessing at names here, my Yelp app was updating) and it was very good! I can recommend it to anyone who likes Chicken and Prosciutto;D  Our waiter was the nicest of nice and extremely attentive. When we ordered dessert he discretely spoke to my father, and ended up arranging the sweetest thing (as again, it's my 21st birthday) On the plate of my dessert was Happy 21st Birthday written out in the chocolate sauce, with a cute little candle sticking out of my dessert! To top that, the local singer/guitar player who was there tonight (who's name I'm hoping I can find, as she was wonderful) sang me a beautiful happy birthday.  I will forever be happy with VinciTorio's, they've treated me, my friends, and my family excellently all 4-5 times I've been, and can honestly say I will miss this place should I ever move.  Do yourself a favor and have a lunch or dinner here sometime. It's absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Visiting from Dallas. Nothing pretentious about this place just good service and good food. We enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"Went here on a date, overall very nice atmosphere. Politely greeted by manager and staff when entering restaurant. We were seated  in a quaint spot towards the back of the restaurant near the kitchen.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu also very attentive to refilling drinks and checking on us during the meal.  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"We had our social group dinner here on Dec 12th.  Long wait for even for someone to come and take our orders and equally long wait to get the food.  I had pork loin and my wife had seafood linguini and they were nothing special. Breads served was warm and tasty and that's the only reason I am giving 3 stars.  I will NOT go back there again."}
{"text":"Came with a large group while traveling for work so we made sure to call ahead and book a 7:00pm reservation for our party of 8. Arrived at 6:50 and we were told there would be a wait \"because we were not expecting a large party tonight\"..... to my understanding this is not the nature of a reservation system but we figured we would stick it out since it was a Sunday night and getting a little late. Tried to order drinks at the bar while waiting- bartended was rude and ignored our large group.  About half an hour of waiting later and we had no update on our table... while other parties continued to be seated around us. Went up to ask the hostess who told us that yes we would have to wait a little longer since we were such a big group that they were unprepared for us. We mentioned maybe they should not have taken our reservation and they seemed confused why we would be upset. This continued until past 8pm- technically after hours on a Sunday for this place- because they had to call in another waitress to take care of our party (as the restaurant was emptying out).  Our waitress was the bright spot of the night- only reason I would give one star instead of zero, if possible. She was very kind and apologetic, unlike any other staff member we spoke to during our hour long wait. She did bring out some appetizers right away to compensate for the long wait. The apps were mediocre (mostly fried, so its hard to go wrong), but our meal went even further downhill from there.  Our party ordered a range of pretty basic foods such as pesto pasta, chicken parm, ravioli etc. I don't know if the kitchen was having a bad day or they had just thrown in the towel but it was honestly the worst Italian food I've ever had (honestly, olive garden has this place beat). My pesto pasta was almost inedible it was drowning in so much sauce, and our table voted it as the best plate served to us. You could tell some of the dishes had decent quality ingredients but the cream sauces were beyond bland, chicken overcooked, and pasta were disappointing for being \"scratch made\". Group consensus was that we would have been better off boiling ramen in the coffee pots in our hotel rooms."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!!! Not only is the food wonderful, but the atmosphere and entertainment is so great. Marcie provided top notch service as well!! We have celebrated our anniversary here two years in a row and it is a definite go-to for a great date night."}
{"text":"The best Italian food! The best service! The best atmosphere! I love this place. We only stopped by after a movie one day, thinking it would be a nice dinner. We were blown away by the food! This is food that you do not eat, but you savor. Food that with every bite, you want to close your eyes, block off all other senses, and only taste the magic!"}
{"text":"For the sake of this review, I am only discussing the lunch buffet that runs from 11am-2pm.  I haven't ordered off the menu yet, so I can't comment.  That said, the buffet is downright wonderful.  For $9 or so you get a drink and all you can eat of a wonderful salad and three (3) high-quality entrees.  One entree is usually starchless so something like a chicken and sausage cacciatore with veggies.  The second is pasta with really good meatballs.  Usually the pasta is stuffed, like a ravioli or tortellini.  The third dish is usually pasta-centric, maybe with vegetables.  I really try to minimize \"bad carbs,\" so a big salad, some meatballs and the meat dish make for a wonderful meal.  My colleague and I eat here about twice a week.  It is tasty, fairly healthy and probably faster than even walking to our company's cafeteria.  The service is always really good.  Occasionally, we order cappuccinos after the meal and the servers always make 'em good, suitable for an Italian place like this.  I only wish it were open until 2:30pm, because I usually eat lunch quite late.  Also, once in a while the meatballs seem to be not as tasty, perhaps it is when I come late on slow day and they have been sitting on the buffet too long.  Still, the buffet is a 5-star deal for sure."}
{"text":"I had the Butternut Squash Ravioli and thought it was just okay. My boyfriend had the Salmon and Shrimp Fettuccine and liked it even though it was soupy. The service was pretty darn slow with drinks, slow with bringing the bread (garlic bread pieces is a poor choice) and then we sat around for some time before the waiter came to take plates. The drinks were the weakest I've ever had. Don't even bother with mixed drinks!"}
{"text":"Seemed promising at first, the cream of mushroom soup and ravioli appetizers along with the salad and bread basket get 5 out of 5 stars. Server was really nice, but an hour and thirteen minutes later and no entr√©es in sight.  Tectonic drift is faster. Congress doesn't take this long. We flag down our server and ask for our food to go. Wow, got our check first. I'm shocked.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana, my daughter had the spaghetti and meat balls, and my wife ordered the salmon and shrimp vincitorios. Spaghetti and meatballs get 3 out of 5 stars, Ragu from a jar actually tastes better. The chicken parmigiana was quite disappointing, the sauce was watery...possibly diluted by the chef's tears when he realized he ruined the salmon and shrimp vincitorio which was as flavorless as hospital food...2 out of 5 stars for those dishes.  Definitely not worth the wait or the price. Damn shame too, I wanted to like this place, but in my humble opinion, they made a $1.68 Budget Gourmet pasta dish shine."}
{"text":"My mom, her friend, and I had dinner at VinciTorio's last night, and what a great dinner it was. A Pilates instructor actually suggested it to my mom and so, as a loyal Yelper, I called my boyfriend and had him check the reviews. Good prices and food? We're there.   We showed up around 7 without having called ahead to find that there was a small line of people ahead of us. The restaurant was packed with families and elderly people. A good sign. We waited and chatted with the hostess, who gave us some recommendations off the menu of her favorite items. The decor was really cute, all I can really think of to call it is busy. Lots of family photographs, fake vines and leaves, painted walls. Even the bathroom has some framed photos of someone's baby, which I found hilarious. There was also some live music, from a guitarist singing covers of sappy soft rock love songs (I'm not going to lie, yes I do know all the lyrics to \"I'll Be\". Judge me.)   We were seated quickly and immediately brought water. Our server's name was Josh and he came right after the buser left to ask us about drinks. None of us wanted any wine or anything and he was super polite and did not judge (appreciated), and took our calamari appetizer order while giving us time to further peruse the menu. He came back with a drink for my mom's friend and a basket of delicious bread: garlic bread on a toasted baguette, and some focaccia with tomato and basil sauce. I decided on their lasagna, my mom's friend got the seafood fettucine, and my mom ordered eggplant parmesan.   The calamari arrived and it was so frickin' good! The spicy marinara sauce was fresh and had huge chunks of tomatoes and a liberal sprinkling of dried peppers in it. The calamari was in large spiraled chunks (rather than the tiny ringed slices you usually get), with a light crispy breading. We finished it off right away with the bread; there is olive oil and balsamic vinegar at the table for you to mix yourself, and we definitely partook in it with the bread. Lots of grease, I know. We were then brought salads and soup; I had a Ceaser salad that had too much parmesan on it, and they both had the Italian wedding soup, which was like an Italian albondigas: a tiny orvo looking pasta, shredded veggies, white beans, and tiny meatballs. They both loved the soup.   At this point, we're already starting to fill up, when our entrees arrived. My mom's friend's pasta came in a large bowl: jumbo shrimp, clams, and mussels on fettucine, drizzled with a light tomato broth. My mom's eggplant parmesan had penne and a vegetable mix (not canned, but sliced and steamed zucchini, summer squash, and carrots).   The eggplant parm was great; I disagree with the review below that says eggplant parmesan is supposed to be cut thick. I've never been to Italy so I can't speak to that level of authenticity, but every Italian deli that I've been to slices the eggplant thinly, breads it, and then stacks it on thick. This is because eggplant has mild toxins it, people. It's purple for a reason-you're not supposed to eat it raw, EVER, and if it's cut thick and not fully cooked to softness, that chewy eggplant texture means it still retains some toxicity.   My lasagna was deliciosu and definitely very fresh; the ricotta was fragrant with basil, and the homemade pasta was extremely tender. There was too much mozzarella at the top but I think I'm just picky; I peeled the mozzarella off the eggplant as well because that much cheese really masks the taste for me. We were all too full to even come close to finishing, so we picked and picked until just packing it up.   Appetizer, one soft drink, and 3 dinner time entrees for $60. How's that for a nice evening?   Commendations again, on the service, the food, and an overall extremely pleasant experience. The ambience is very nice, and I could see this being a lovely place for a date or to bring your family to. It makes me feel good to support a family-owned business that is so welcoming to their clientele."}
{"text":"We have a business networking group that meets here.  Have been coming here every other week for over a year and the food quality is consistently good.  The staff is consistently professional, and the owners Ginger and Mario are welcoming like we were dining in their own home.  I love \"mom and pop\" places."}
{"text":"Food was really good and well priced. However, I had to ask several times to get my water refilled. Perhaps it was just the day. I will go back tho and probably give it 4 stars after."}
{"text":"Wow. Not sure how to review this! The food was awesome,  atmosphere incredible,  entertainment outstanding then completely downhill from there.  My meal was given to one of the sock children at the table, apparently he ate quite a bit of it and it was taken from him and them given to me at the opposite end of the table, never mentioning that the sick cold was eating off my plate! I had to ask the waited about it and when  she ?dmitted the mistake she did take the plate away,  I'm pretty sure they simply just went in the back and put the same food on a different plate. At no point did the restaurant attempt to make things right at minimum take the meal off or bill! Really people.  Great food but not sure if I can come back disgusting! Happy Holidays! Ugh"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly service. We will come here again, although we will avoid holidays like Valentine's day at Vincitorio. Prices skyrocketed that day and I was not very impressed by the menu. Make sure you reserve a spot there as it gets very crowded on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"This will easily be a place that I return to!! There are two sides to VinciTorios, a restaurant and a wine bar. The wine bar is large, feels very cozy and welcoming (as did the rest of the restaurant). Visited during dinner time and the restaurant was busy but the staff was all very friendly, seemed to be having a good time, they were well dressed neatly and did not seem rushed/distracted. Psss, ask for Tracy, she was awesome!   As a first time visitor it was comforting to hear all the \"oooo's\" and \"ahhhh's\" from surrounding tables as food was brought out. The portion sizes are great and you can taste that each dish is so delicately seasoned with pure passion! We found that ordering an appetizer along with 2 main dishes was a bit too much food but glad there's leftovers. A basket of warm bread with garlic spread is brought out to every table as well."}
{"text":"I was here a couple weekends ago for the Phoenix Rock n' Roll Marathon & Half-Marathon, and we had a ex-local recommend this place as a great pre-race carbo-loading spot.  We made a reservation for 6:30p Saturday night.  It turned out to be totally worth the drive from our hotel in Tempe (which really wasn't that far, but still)!  Soon after we arrived and were promptly seated, the crowd around the front door increased exponentially with every passing minute.  The wait must have been really long - thank goodness for the reservation!  Definitely follow suit, especially if you plan to come on a Friday or Saturday night.  To start, our party of 3 ordered one of the flatbreads.  These are not on the menu online for whatever reason, but I'd suggest we all take it as a sign to not order it.  Really.  It was pretty pricey, tiny, and not particularly impressive.  You'd be better off just asking for another basket of bread they bring, because the focaccia was just as good (and free).  We all ended up getting the same thing - the rigatoni al forno.  It came with a salad, which was actually really good.  But then came the main attraction itself, and ,oly moly was that delicious!  I ate every single last little piece of rigatoni, and then sopped up the sauce with more (free) bread.  Don't judge - I ran it all off the next day. :o)  If you are in the area, I'd definitely recommend checking this place out.  It was pretty reasonably priced, considering the portion sizes (for everything except the flatbread), and super tasty."}
{"text":"What is it about VinciTorios that I love so much? See, it isn't just ONE thing....it's everything. My husband and I eat here about once a month. Sometimes an early dinner and sometimes the lunch buffet. And everytime we go we say \"We ought to eat here more often\" This time we are sticking to it!  I arrived last night around 6 with no reservation. My husband was coming from somewhere else and so first to arrive grabs the table. (This is a small place and nowhere to wait for a table, so either you make reservations or go early for dinner!) I managed to get the last available table (yay!) and was seated promptly. And as always greeted by the owner. We ordered a drink (wine and beer only, no full bar) and I had what I always order: the tortellini aurora. Oh man, this is so yum...cheese tortellini w/ fresh mushrooms and peas in a tomato cream sauce. My husband (who always orders some sort of veal) decided to be different and order the lasagna. Delicious!  When I looked around the place, there were tables of people laughing talking and enjoying the atmosphere and food. The open seating makes you feel like part of a big family. And our waiter (sorry I am having a senior moment and can't recall his name, but he has been our waiter before) was delightful as always. Attentive and friendly. When we left the owner once again thanked us for coming in. It is almost like we were his guests.  The only issues are: parking can be a little difficult on a weekend night as it is close to the cheap movie theater. And the live entertainment is not necessary and not that good. The man on the electric guitar singing 60-70 hits by John Sebastian or the Beatles was really out of place. I like the house canned music so much better!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, food, and service! So happy that we stumbled across this gem. Piano player on the weekends, homemade pasta, and incredible service from our server Marcie. Best dining experience I have had since I can remember!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant by far.  We love coming here for the ambiance, the service, the good wine selection, and overall the food.  We have had a bunch of items on the menu now and have not been disappointed by anything.  In fact let me say this another way, the food here is amazingly fantastic!  We love every bite as it is a mouthwatering experience.  The Cannelloni Rossini is one of my fav's and I get both the marinara and creme sauces.  My wife loves the Ravioli Carbonara.  When I get another dish I like the in house made Angel hair pasta.  The sauces are zesty rich or creamy smooth.   We have come on many nights where they have the nice piano jazz playing or the soloist singer who both are great while eating our meals.  Love love love this place.  Thanks Mario for coming to Arizona!"}
{"text":"Delicious. We had them make us saut√©ed calamari as an appetizer, and then I got the Trofie Al Pesto and my dad got the eggplant Parmesan. Both absolutely delicious. The saut√©ed calamari sauce was DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Not worth the money. Come for wine and desert, but stay away from the entrees. We tried Lasagna, Pesto Alfredo, Veal Masala, and one other. None of them were very good. We got only dirty wine glasses, and the wait staff wasn't very attentive. The atmosphere was nice and the cannoli was tastey."}
{"text":"If you like Italian food, you must visit VinciTorio's! It's hidden in a strip mall, but once you enter, the ambiance is so hometown Italian. There's live music, which also really adds to the vibe. The service is great -- friendly, feels very much like a family-owned restaurant that treats employees and customers well. The pace is also a little slower, which I really enjoy when eating Italian. Bottles of wine are half-price on Wednesday, which is a really nice bonus. And the food (the most important part) is delicious! Portions are large, and the pasta (or at least what I ordered) is homemade. It's simple but great. Be sure to save room for dessert because the tiramisu is to die for!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today with a group of co-workers.  This was my first visit and I enjoyed it, we all did.  Most of us had the lunch buffet for $8.95 AND includes a drink!  Food was good.  Selection was good.  Service was good.  Great atmosphere.  Great for lunch or in the evening a more intimate encounter...."}
{"text":"I never knew this place was here! It definitely adds some class to the Tempe Cinema plaza.  I met some friends here for a birthday celebration. Inside, it looks very much like what you'd expect a real Italian restaurant to look like. We were in the bar area (Enoteca) to the right. Its very homey feeling. We sat at a nice long picnic style dark wood table. It was just right for the amount of people we had.  Our server was very, very nice and attentive. Especially since we had people arriving at different times. They have an excellent wine selection. We all tried a different flatbread, which were a really good size for 1, if youre really hungry, and perfect for sharing. I had the Pugliese and it was very, very good. I would absolutely recommend it and this place to others wanting a nice semi intimate setting for a happy hour or dinner.   We left just as the accordion player started his rounds, not a fan. They also have plenty of kitschy souvenirs for purchase. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not from the PHX area, so I am not sure what the locals consider authentic or good food in any particular cuisine. I have been to Italy (still have about five pounds left on me from that trip!). I eat LOTS of food in lots of places. I've had the good fortune to live in NY and SF, both with excellent Italian options.  I don't want to bash the place, but it sounded like the food was going to be far better than what I ended up with. Nevermind that there's a weird gift-store set up in the front with bedazzled t-shirts and kitchen towels. They seem to market to the happy-hour crowd with lots of 'wine o'clock' type merchandise, and it's a little jarring to see when you go there for food. It's loud and crowded and not a place I'd go on a date. This is 'family Italian', not \"nice/fancy Italian\". The waiters didn't really talk about wine (the house cab is 14 Hands -- no one even tried to tempt us with a chianti or other Italian red. They are just there to serve food and take drink orders. There are plentiful TVs in the bar area (also tables), and there's a piano guy playing 'muzak' versions of Billy Joel and the Beatles.  So, on to the food. Salads were the bland-o mix of iceberg and romaine, with the requisite raw onion and canned black olives. I don't think kale or rapini even made it on the list. Appetizers were fried anything. I liked the calamari (hard to mess up) but would have rather had the fried (toasted) ravioli go with marinara sauce instead of jalape√±o dip. It's like Italian/SW flavors. Fine, but don't market it as Italian. The waiters kept our table full of tasty, but soft, garlic bread.  For the entree, the saltimbocca alla romana (pork chop with goodies) was just ok. Steamed broccoli was the side. That's a fine side but... in a 'great Italian joint', I'd have expected more garlic, more olive oil, more roasted vegetables with rosemary or something more akin to the simple, yet delicious, cooking of Puglia or Friuli or Tuscany or ... anywhere. I got a flattened chop swimming in a gravy-brown 'white wine reduction' (and yes, it was quite tasty because I like salt and meat juice, but I couldn't taste anything else). It was just kind of lackluster. I was hoping for a seared/browned chop, juicy on the inside, but... just.. meh.  I'm giving three stars because the service was nice, we had a good time, no one got sick and we left full, but... it was just kind of underwhelming given all the hype about it. I'd be curious to see if PHX has real fancy Italian."}
{"text":"We went there on the day they had live band playing. They have once a month. It was my friend's birthday and we had a great time. Food is great. We ordered fried raviolis and potato tomato basil pasta! It was yumm. They gave a complimentary birthday desert, raspberry custard."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We have been going here since it was a sandwich shop.   This is a very nice locally owned authentic Italian restaurant.  They make most of their pasta fresh in house. Dinner starts with a lovely basket of home made bread.  Focaccia and garlic bread.  So yummy.  This time they had a focaccia with some tomato sauce on top.  It was so yummy.  I always take home a few pieces of bread to eat with my left overs. I almost always get the chicken pesto trofoli pasta. It is a bowl full of happiness.  Perfect balance of pasta chicken and sauce. I also love the squash ravioli in winter. My husband always gets the cheese steak.  He loves it. The daily special is usually a winner when we go with family.  Ambiance is perfect. Low lighting at night.  A very nice patio during the cooler months.  The best thing about this place is that you can go there for any occasion.  Dress up for a fancy dinner or stop in on the fly.  You will never feel out of place, over or under dressed. They have a wonderful wine list and dessert cocktails. Must try this place."}
{"text":"Thick cuts of handmade pasta in rich-yet-light sauces.  Garlic bread on the table.  Wines by-the-glass in the single-digit range."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. I ordered the eggplant parmesan and my friend got the fettuccine alfredo with chicken and asparagus. Both were excellent and portions were large so we took home leftovers. Salads were standard. The bread basket had toasted garlic bread (blah) and focaccia which was quite tasty. We got the cannoli for dessert and my only complaint is that for $6 you would think that you would get at least 2, but it is just one, doctored up with chocolate chips and raspberry and chocolate sauces. A truly good cannoli does not need any of that. I lived near the north end of Boston for many years so I was sure to ask if the filling was homemade and if the cannolis were filled to order. They answered yes on both counts. All in all I would not order it again for that price. My friend and I agreed that the best part of our experience was the charming accordian player who went from table to table playing everything from assorted Sinatra to Come on Baby Light My Fire (!).  It really made for a fun dining experience. Next time I plan to go for lunch as they have a pretty extensive menu of hot sandwiches for under $8."}
{"text":"This is Italian at it's finest.  So worth a visit.  Inside is inviting, staff is very friendly.  Food is just FABULOUS.  I take a lot of business lunch meetings here and out of towners are always impressed. My family loves this place.  We have held some of our family events in their private back room and they do a terrific job with big groups too."}
{"text":"Last weekend my mom decided my family and I should all go out for dinner. She had recommended this restaurant. When we went I thought the inside was very nice although a bit crowded but still nice. We had reservations and they sat us immediately. After waiting a bit our waitress decided to ask us what appetizers we had wanted. We ordered the calamari. After about 10 minutes of waiting we were wanting to order our drinks. Typically restaurants will ask your drink order at the very beginning but not this time. I had to look around for our waitress and ask her if it was ok we ordered drinks. So she came over and got our drink order and soon after brought us our calamari. I understand it's not going to be the freshest but the calamari was like a basket of chips and marinara. Some pieces were so chewy they felt like rubber. I understand calamari can be that way but this was bad. After waiting with a now upset stomach we had gotten our food. My fianc√© and I got chicken fettuccine Alfredo, my mom had gotten the daily special which was spinach ravioli, and my grandparents got a pizza. My chicken Alfredo was bland and beyond creamy. My mothers raviolis was basically one big cheese soup dish. After having a bad experience with food and service we got the bill. It was well over $100 but it was not worth that at all. Being said we split the check in 3 and I have never been so upset to waste my money. Price doesn't affect me but if you're going to be charging those prices at least serve edible good food. They claim to be authentic Italian but this compares to nothing from food back east."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I found it back in 2007 and eat here about once a week. I'll keep coming back! Best Italian food that I've found in Phoenix yet. Reasonable prices and a nice staff, too."}
{"text":"We go here for office lunches for the buffet. It is quick and as far as buffets go it isn't bad. I have had better Italian food but for the price and convenience it's hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks this Valentine's Day. But they sure squeezed the tables in. It was too tight. Would have given a five otherwise."}
{"text":"Very generous portions and Winesday is a must (half off ALL bottles)!  My wife had the eggplant parm and I had a delicious cheese steak hoagie.  This will be our local Italian joint!"}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for my wife and I.  Great atmosphere.  The wine bar is amazing and has a piano player on Friday and Saturday nights.  This is our 'go-to- restaurant, the pizza is to die for (especially if Mario is cooking) and everything on the menu is stellar.  Chicken and veal parm will knock your socks off.  My wife loves the seafood plates.  The bartenders are great as well.  Pretty much the perfect restaurant and you can tell they really care about the experience they provide."}
{"text":"Marcy was our server. She was super helpful, suggested a great dressing for my salad, wanted to know where we were from, so friendly! We sat in the wine bar area.   The bruschetta was unreal. Just a couple of ingredients (like it should be) and make sure you ask for marinara sauce to go with the complimentary bread.   Somehow this place feels like its own little world, we even forgot where we were for a bit. Such a cool little restaurant"}
{"text":"I did not like the way in was treated by the owner Mario. When i was ready to pay my bill both of my cards were declined. I was just informed even though there was money on both of those cards as i just loaded money on them before i ate at his place, the back that issues both of those cards suspected fraud so they put a lock on my cards for my protection. if they are locked i dont give a fudge how much money is on them cause if they are locked or froze its not gonna mean shit cause they are not gonna work. that is why they were declined. not because of money. maybe you should find out the whole story before you say money is the reason. Good day too you. and i will not be back."}
{"text":"VinciTorio's 1835 E. Elliot Road, Tempe, Arizona  We arrived at VinciTorio's on a Saturday evening at 6:00 with reservations. We were seated in about 5 minutes  We skipped the appetizers and started with salad. I and companion had house salads; mine with a house Italian dressing, and companion's with a Balsamic dressing that didn't appear to have any balsamic in it.. The salads were fresh with some nice frisee, but lacked tomato.   Main courses were ordered. I ordered Linguini with clam sauce with extra garlic. Flavor was satisfactory, but it would have been much better with a less watery sauce. The clams appeared to have been from a can rather than fresh. While my personal preference would have been a slightly thickened sauce, it was properly prepared and could be easily sopped up with lots of the excellent garlic bread.  Companion ordered ravioli, which when brought out were sitting in pools of water in the sauce. They obviously were not properly drained and/or leaked in the hot water bath.  Again, my personal preference would have been to have the sauce thicker so that it adhered more to the pasta, but that is a matter for debate among chefs.  On to desserts, the absolute high point of the meal. I ordered the Panna Cotta  which came with macerated raspberries on top and blueberries on the plate. It was smooth and silky and just melted on your palate. It was just as good as the last time I ate here.  Companion had the same dessert and pronounced it wonderful.  Service was at a bit of a rushed pace. The restaurant was reasonably clean.  Compared to the last review I did of this restaurant, this was not as good an experience. The food seemed to be downgraded as compared to my last review, though the Panna Cotta was every bit as good as I remembered it being. Service could use some polish as well as slowing down a bit. I felt like they just wanted to serve us and get us out of the place.  One less star than the last review."}
{"text":"3/16/16  Decided to have dinner here with Mom since we were in the area.  Ginger, the wife of Mario (the chef and owner of Vincitorios), and a host greeted us at the host's stand.  Mom didn't want to eat outside, so we asked to be seated indoors.  The only available table, as all the others were reserved (due to a 6 pm live show), was a four-top round table at the corner next to the restrooms.  Aside from having to smell the room spray emanating from the restrooms every time someone entered or exited, the corner table would've been a nice area, as it was surrounded by walls decorated to look like windows with lace curtains.  I wished we'd left and chosen another restaurant, but we stayed.   Our server, Crystal, came and asked if we wanted something to drink besides water.  We settled with water, but I said I might order a glass of wine depending on what I choose to have for dinner.  We finally got around to ordering (Mom wanted the Seafood Fradiavolo, and I was torn between the Stuffed pork chop and the Cannelloni.  She said the pork chop was good, so I chose that, and she asked me again if I wanted to order some wine.  Still looking, I said.  I also asked if we could have some bread.  Soon after she left, I decided I'd just skip wine and have dessert, so when she returned with the bread and our salads, I told her I'd skip the wine and opt for dessert, instead, so I asked her if I may look over the dessert menu.  So far, she's all smiles, and everything is good.  We're done with our salads, and Crystal takes our plates away, and soon after, our food arrives, and she returns shortly and asks if everything is OK.  I asked if the homemade tiramisu contained powdered sugar in the filling.  She said she'd find out.  Before she left, though, we did complain that Mom's Fradiavolo looked very soupy.  Mom wasn't happy.  Crystal said that's how it's supposed to look, so Mom asked if she could have extra marinara to add to the dish and perhaps that will thicken it up.  Crystal obliged, and I requested for more garlic bread.  I wasn't happy with my stuffed pork chop's b√©chamel sauce, either, but I didn't complain.  I opted to be positive about the tasty gnocchi.  That is, the ones that weren't doused with the awful b√©chamel sauce and that actually had some browned butter and sage flavor on them.  I contented myself with more garlic bread, and the thought of having tiramisu.  I hoped Crystal would come back soon to tell me if the tiramisu was good to go (not containing powdered sugar), but she didn't.  Neither did the extra garlic bread.    After awhile, I saw Crystal checking on two tables next to us, but she quickly left.  A young man started attending to us, so I figured she'd passed us off to someone else.  Mom wasn't happy about this, and neither was I.  She didn't think Crystal had other tables, but I said that I saw her attending to two others.  Mom used to wait tables decades ago, and her coworkers would say \"What do you do?,\" \"What do you say?,\" and \"I don't see you talking much, yet you get large tips- how?\"  Mom knew to bring items to her customers before they would ask for them, and she didn't get too chummy, or hover around and be intrusive.  It's why she's hard to impress when dining out, and why she thinks I overtip all the time.  But back to tonight's meal.  Since Crystal never came back with the extra bread, and Mom and I were both done with our meal (we didn't eat much), I'd asked the young man to find out if the tiramisu contained powdered sugar in the filling, and he said he'd ask.  While he was gone, Crystal came back and she asked if we wanted our food to be boxed.  We said yes, but not to include the soupy broth of the Fradiavolo, and I only wanted the meat and the pasta, no b√©chamel sauce.  She leaves.  Soon after, the young man comes back to tell me that the tiramisu isn't made with powdered sugar, so I ordered it, and as he leaves, Crystal arrives with the boxes, and she must've heard me order the dessert.  She said, no, the tiramisu's filling contained powdered sugar, so I can't have it.  I asked \"But he just found out for me that it didn't.\"  \"Oh, he must've misunderstood.\"  I took it as she didn't want us to occupy her table any longer by having dessert.    Mom was upset that I tipped 15%.  I tip at least 20-25%, but I tip even more for friendly and helpful service that is absent of condescension.  For years I'd spoken highly of Vincitorio's to Mom, and I was excited to take her tonight.  I lamented that we had arrived too early (4:45p) and miss out on hearing a cool vocalist at 6, and Mom seemed interested when I mentioned that the singer arrived and was prepping her stage, which was hidden from our table.  I'd hoped we'd get to return to enjoy the show, but Mom doesn't want to go back, and I most likely won't return."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to come here for dinner. I ordered the Meatless Veggie Hoagie which contained grilled spinach, tomatoes, cheese, fried onions and mushrooms. I noticed that the chips tasted homemade which were quite tasty and crunchy fresh.  My friends had meat items, so I didn't get to try their dishes. They did say that they enjoyed their meal, so no complaints there.  Our server was very attentive and kept our glasses full and the entertainer was fabulous. There was an older gentleman that played the accordion the entire time we were there.  My friends paid for everything which I am grateful for, so I didn't even see the bill.  Isn't that sweet? So I can't comment on how much it cost."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! I loved the freshness of the homemade Pasta and sauce. The meatballs were made from a very high-quality me as they were not greasy and were very light. The customer service was great and the ambience was perfect with the live music. The prices are a bit high, however the product is top quality so that is justified. They only thing I would change is to have a bit more seasoning for more vibrant flavors. I will definitely be back when I'm in the mood for Italian."}
{"text":"Top-Notch Italian food. Have dined there on 4 occassions and been impressed each time... I can verify that the pasta is handmade. One afternoon I ate a late lunch and watched the chef in action.   Low-key dining. Candles on the tables. Acoustic guitar player on Friday. Nice spot for a date."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my very favorite spots. Their cream of mushroom soup is excellent. In fact I once began craving it in Glendale and drove all the way out just for that.  Their bartender is knowledgeable and is happy to help you pick out something you'd like. (Also, let you try and write down the names)  The waitstaff has always left something to be left desired and the place is always packed. I'm not a big fan of their bread.  However, their from scratch pastas and ravioli is all I've ever ordered outside of the mushroom soup & wine. Which, I must say is amazing.  I highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This place was packed Saturday evening. Very cramped interior. This Italian food may fly in the Valley, but it wouldn't in New York or New Jersey. Pasta was overcooked - I stuck my fork into it and it disintegrated. Sauce was watery. Entree itself was alright but tiny portions left me hungry. The garlic bread also was just a hoagie roll cut in half. However, the staff was very polite."}
{"text":"This was our go to place for Italian with friends as it was always consistent. This time we took friends from out of state. My wife and the other lady both ordered the chicken parmigiana but both said it was bland (just like cooked tomato for the sauce no flavor). I ordered The spaghetti with clams and have also ordered it before. This time although a large portion it also lacked flavor. The other guest ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and said he enjoyed it.  Only one in four meals. Will be a while before we return but will check Yelp to see if things improve."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. My go-to Italian restaurant in the valley. I've ordered a little bit of everything over the handful of times I've visited. Romantic atmosphere as well. Great place with live music, wine, etc. I recommend this restaurant without a blink of an eye. Staff is pleasing. No complaints! The bread tastes amazing too."}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful experience. This restaurant was so accommodating, we had 16 people in our party for a bachelorette and it was great! We had a blast within the piano live singing and open bar. The waitstaff was delightful and everyone had such a nice time. I highly recommend calling ahead and getting a table suitable for your party. We have had several gatherings at this restaurant and it is absolutely top notch. The bartender was hilarious, we were treated so well!!!!!!"}
{"text":"For a fantastic night with friends, pizza and wine, you have to love VinciTorio. The wine selection is limited but nicely selected. The pizza is delizious! and the service - to die for. We went with the ham and artichoke pizza along with a bacon and tomato. Are those amazing combinations or what!? We were treated so well, enjoyed ourselves silly and loved the whole evening. Thank you VinciTorio, you brought me and my friends a beautiful night!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time...exceded my expectations ! Friendy, knowledgeable staff, great food with many options...The comfy feel of the place does it for me, stayed 3 hours..Ill be back lots Im certain!!"}
{"text":"Italian lunch buffet!  We were pleasantly surprised to see a buffet when we came here for lunch.  For $8.95, our buffet included a mixed salad with 3 types of dressing, croutons, olives, and tomatoes, and 3 entrees.  Soda is also included in the price, another plus.  The entrees we had for today were a farfalle pasta dish in a creamy tomato sauce, chicken and mushrooms in a wine sauce, and cheese ravioli in a marinara sauce with meatballs.  All were very good, although I would say the meatball and ravioli entree was the weakest tasting of the 3.  The meatballs, while a very good portion, tasted very plain compared to the other 2 dishes.  Service was very friendly and we had drinks refilled quickly.  If I'm in the mood for a sit-down Italian restaurant for lunch, this is the place I will be!"}
{"text":"What a hell of an experience this place was. It started with some restaurant patron outside who was talking to myself complimenting me and then almost starting a fight with me. At that point the night was already off to a great start, but I won't hold that against the restaurant. The place is quite busy so it must be a good place. One thing I didn't like was feeling so damn cramped in this place. I am sure there are seats that aren't cramped, but in my case I was stuck in a corner. I couldn't even get out of my seat if needed.  The service was fair and the pasta was okay, but not memorable. I won't be frequenting this restaurant, but I wouldn't mind going back to give it a second shot."}
{"text":"Took my Sicilian mother here from Chicago,  I thought from the reviews it would be perfect for her.  Soooo wrong!  The pasta sauce was BLAND as well as everything else had.  Pretty sure the chicken and pork was previously cooked and reheated which made it dried out.  Service was very slow and food is way overpriced.  I really wanted to like this place but do not recommend it."}
{"text":"If you like Italian, this is the place!     What a treat it was eating here.  We were with a large group -- first timers.  The food is delicious, reasonably priced and service excellent.  On top of all of that portions are huge.   There was a lot of variety of food served at the table.  Everyone raved about the food.  The location and decor is really nice.  Servers were fast, professional and excellent.  We have absolutely no complaints.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"In a way I'm glad I don't live closer because I'd be here all the time, which isn't a bad thing except for being broke. The service and cozy atmosphere has always given me that warm fuzzy feeling. The prices are reasonable which gets me into trouble because I could easliy order two plates because the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"We've had great experiences at this establishment in the past so I'm giving them a break on my rating.  We started the evening with the owner exclaiming 'You don't have a reservation on Valentine's Day?' and then proceeded to seat us immediately.  The young lady that seated us then told us that our kids could have a kids menu to color on but that they couldn't order from it.  Huh?  She came back and told us she was mistaken.  Okay-so we moved forward and enjoyed dinner although would have preferred to have the full menu available rather than the Valentine's Day menu that limited our options.  Three of our five meals were excellent and the others were mediocre.  Our waitress did a nice job and the atmosphere is pleasant.   I hope the owner doesn't get too big-headed and blow it because we don't spend our money where arrogance and disregard for customer experience is rampant."}
{"text":"Our last visit in June was very disappointing, but since I have been following Mario for nearly 23 years I passed it off as everybody has bad nights.  Went back after 4 months, had the pizza, was average, dough was soggy but had good flavor.  What really blew me was the wine list, pretty good, but whoa! serious price increases!  I love wine with good Italian food but they have gone into the stratosphere on pricing.  I guess all good things do come to an end, time to find another place, shouldn't be hard, lots of competition out there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! Can't wait to go back for half price wine bottle Wednesday! This place is a great hidden gem  1/10/18- back for half price wine Wednesday and some delicious pasta!"}
{"text":"Can't believe we haven't written a review yet for one of our favorite neighborhood spots. we've been here so many times with various friends and family. the spot is cozy and comfortable...nice little \"over the top\" Tuscan design. Friendly and prompt service when you sit down, and oh so yummy garlic bread is brought right away. you'll be tempted to fill up, but don't.   for starters, we love the pear/proscuitto/burrata salad. not cheap but easy to share with several diners at the table. their caesar salad is fresh and full of garlicky lemony goodness.  we have several favorite pastas -- the cannelloni, which is not smothered with bechamel, but has just the right amount; the ravioli carbonara -- chicken and beef filled ravioli with an eggy, bacon cream sauce; and the ravioli de zucca -- butternut squash ravioli with a crazy-good four-cheese sauce.  we also love their wood-oven pizza. the crust has a great chew and it's not overloaded with sauce. we particularly love the quattro stagioni -- mushrooms, artichokes, proscuitto and sausage...we ask for it \"scattered\" so all pieces have all the goodies.   we always end with the tiramisu because it is so good.  it is not the cheapest Italian restaurant around, but I'd much rather spend more for great ambiance, made from scratch food and the best service around."}
{"text":"This place was great for the price and concept. We came here with a big group for Father's Day and we sat in the side area.  They had happy hour wine ($6 a glass) till 6 and we took full advantage of it. They brought out hot fresh garlic bread and kept it flowing throughout dinner.   I had the Chicken Scarpara which was chicken saut√©ed with garlic, lemon, mushrooms and pepperocinis in a white wine reduction. The wine reduction was a bit runny but the flavor overall was pretty good.   The wine list was extensive and our server was great, she was quick to refill drinks and take orders (and with a group as big as our that is impressive).   This is a great place for a big group and easy on the wallet. A-OK!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice now.  The first time, I really loved their calamari appetizer.  The rest of the dinner a seafood pasta was just okay.  The second time, I ordered a chicken breast with asparagus in a cream sauce (alfredo) with a side of  Italian wedding soup.  The cream sauce was so bland that I had to dress it up with condiments on the table.  The soup was a big disappointment as well no flavor and too much orzo and not enough broth.  My husband had the lasagna and found it cheesy with very little meat.  With all the great reviews, I was willing to give it another try, but the price is not enough for me to try it a third."}
{"text":"It's overall a great place to eat on a special occasion.  The food is amazing, but the servers are inconsistent.  Some will work with you, and others won't.  For example, once I ordered linguini vongole but then changed my mind, but I still got charged the 18 dollars for the linguine!!! The servers were completely unwilling to change the bill.  But once I asked how much side salads cost and the server gave me one free!!!  You never know what you'll get.  The food is SUPER expensive, but the food is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little mom&pop style Italian restaurant.  Our order included: Antipasto Italiano, Lasagna Casareccia, Linguine Vongole, kids Fettuccini Alfredo, and a two topping small pizza with Italian sausage and pepperoni.   Antipasto: probably my favorite part of the meal. Thinks slices of chilled mozzarella (the real kind), tomatoes, olives, artichokes and bell peppers. Added a little salt and stacked bits and pieces on the complimentary garlic bread for an super awesome starter. Party in my mouth!  The kids thought the garlic bread was the best they ever had. They could have been starving, but it was still pretty darn good.   Lasagna: tasted really fresh yet reach, odd, yes, but full flavored. Noodles were cooked perfectly and handmade. The portion was huge, almost too big, but that's okay. The sausage was big enough to pick out, but that's just because I'm not a fan. It had more of a chopped than ground texture which was better, IMO.   Linguini: the portion was huge, like a whole box of noodles huge, and their were clams appropriate to that amount, so huge amount as well. The noodles were rather flavorless, and well, all I really tasted was clams. I felt this dish would benefit from a garlic cream sauce with it. Maybe order it on the side if considering this dish.   Fettuccini: predictable. Well portioned.   Pizza: thin and fully covered in toppings, but undercooked and soggy halfway into the middle, but we all really enjoyed the flavors and the crust.   Would love to come back for dinner to try the butternut squash ravioli or the trofie al pesto. Those weren't on the lunch menu, and I would have preferred them to the linguini in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Aw shucks! I really wanted to like this place but the quality of the food just doesn't match the prices they charge. We arrived on a busy weekday for a tasty pasta dinner. Unfortunately everything we ordered was mediocre.   We were seated pretty quickly. Although it took a bit for our server to greet us once seated. He was very friendly and gave a great explanation on the daily specials. But throughout the night he seemed slightly overwhelmed/forgetful. By the time he came back over to take our drink order we had already decided what we wanted to eat.  I started with a shared appetizer of prosciutto wrapped asparagus. It wasn't terrible nor was it anything special. For my entree I got the Ravioli Di Zucca and the Italian Wedding soup. After finishing the asparagus it took too long for our soup to come out. At that point we had already started a second bottle of wine. Once we got it, the soup was bland and the bits of pasta in it were mushy and overcooked. My ravioli was alright but again nothing special. There was also slightly too much cheese sauce for the pasta to really stand out on the plate. My dinner date also didn't have much to say about the Cream of Mushroom soup or Spaghetti Bolognese...Actually, you should stay clear of the spaghetti entirely. The meat sauce is watery and the beef is overcooked like crazy. The meatballs had a strange artificial meat flavor and the texture was outputting. My date couldn't muscle more than one down.  If this place had slightly lower prices I'd give it another chance. But I can't justify the prices for the quality of food offered."}
{"text":"Amazing food and incredible wait staff. The atmosphere is gorgeous and all the family pics on the walls make you feel like you're part of the family. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here last night for a friends birthday dinner.  We made a reservation so we were seated vey quickly. As soon as we were seated, we were served warm garlic bread that was quite tasty. We all got Caesar salads that were so delicious.  A friend and I split the eggplant sorrentino, and it was great. The sauce was very fresh and light. The entrees claim to come with a side of pasta and sauteed veggies. The veggie we got was literally 1 piece of broccoli on each plate. Another disappointing thing was they charge a $5 \"sharing\" fee so by the time we got the check we realized we should have just gotten our own dishes for about the same price. Another odd thing was that the only thing our server did was take our orders and give us the check. The bus boy refilled our drinks, brought out our dishes, cleared our plates etc. the lighting is kind of dark but there is nice ambiance. I would probably eat here again."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in 10 years. The place is nice and the service was good but the food was just average. It was busy for a Monday night so people do like it. Had a caesars salad that was soaked in dressing. My wife and I both had different pastas that were  just okay. They give you bread to start which was just average."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner at VinciTorios. The basket of bread came with cubes of what looked and tasted like focaccia. We each had a glass of $8 chianti but I can't remember  the specific name of the one we had. There is a pretty large selection of wines by the glass.  Instead of soup with our pasta entrees we had the house salads. I would have liked more mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce but it was ok.   One of us had the homemade Gnocchi al Pomodoro Fresco. It was delicious and not overly smothered with sauce. The other of us had the Ravioli di Zuca - a butternut squash filled pasta. The squash was very sweet. The sauce tasted like a light cream sauce. WHen I read the menu I thought it would have a thicker consistency with more of a strong cheese flavor but it really tasted overall like a cream-type sauce.  It was also very good.   Affordable and delicious - we will most probably return every once in a while - definitely better than many of the other local restaurants."}
{"text":"Love this place... It is close to my office so i come for lunch anytime i have chance to go out. I usually sit at the bar and order off the menu. I have not tried the buffet yet.... The Linguini Vongole is excellent and taste as if it was made at home... Must try for lunch is the Chicken parm sandwich that often get...  The flat breads are amazing.... I have tried all the flat breads and love them all...The Stromboli aka calzone is huge tasty and crispy. Love it. .. I have not had a bad dish yet..."}
{"text":"Love Italian food. Tiramisu was great very tasty. They need room. Servants was nice and very accommodating. The place us always packed."}
{"text":"A great, unique place for Italian! I have been here several times and have always been pleased. The staff has always been incredibly generous and accommodating to us whenever I have eaten here. It's a great little restaurant that had a one-man cover band the last time I was here and he was quite good. Perfect sized live entertainment for the small environment at VinciTorio's: not too loud! Their pastas are fantastic and were just what I needed on the eve of the P. F. Chang's Marathon in January, I look forward to revisiting again soon!   Keep singing,  -Jerron"}
{"text":"I am saddened by sending in this review.  We have dined here many many times and the food and service has been great.    However, a few days ago I ordered several pizzas and inquired about salads.  I was given an option for $48 for a full tray.  I can get 5 large pizzas for $80 but then some salad for $48??  I decided on the half tray for $24.  That was a bad decision.    I was then 'assigned' house and ranch dressing.  I requested blue cheese instead of ranch and the response from the owner was \"Ranch is what most folks get.\"  How about asking what type of dressing I would like and not give me your attitude about what most people get?  Reluctantly the order was changed to Blue Cheese.  Then she says \"You should probably pay now because picking up at 6 during our busiest time with people lined up outside might take some time.\"  I obliged and paid up front.  Well, at 6, the pizzas were ready as well as the salad and guess what? Not one person waiting in line for a table.  I then get home a grab a $2.50 bag of mixed green salad and add it to this half sheet, which DOUBLES the amount of salad, throw in a few tomatoes and olives and for $3 I just doubled the size of my $24 salad.  Just so it is clear, the $24 salad had some tomatoes, cucumbers, and a few onions, so it is pretty plain jane.  Pizza was good, but the $24 salad really was hard to swallow.  Get the pizza to go, but a $2.50 bag of salad is a much better way \"to go\"!!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times.  Cody the bartender is pretty cool and understands customer satisfaction.  The older bartender is a d-ick.  Only interested in getting off early"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for pizza--not crappy, junk pizza, but a nice pie that I could sit down with and eat with a knife and fork if I wanted to.  After dropping off my wife and daughter at the movies (it was a mommy-daughter movie night), I began searching. . .   VinciTorio's, right here next to the movie theatre.  Okay, let's try this.  Good service, check Outdoor seating with those big gas heater thingies on chilly nights, check Nice ambiance, check Good pizza, check  Keep in mind that's just a check, and not a star for the pizza.  There was little or no sauce on this pizza, which kept me from enjoying it as much as I would have liked to.  Not a bad taste, and maybe you will like it better than I did, but I like saucy pizzas, and they don't have them here, I guess, unless you ask for them.  Everything was fresh and the pizza was well-made, with a nice crust.  No issues there.  The three stars is from the pizza snob in me who wants that burst of spiced tomato taste along with the pepperoni and sausage.  Nonetheless, I ate until I was stuffed.  I'll come back some time to see how the pasta is."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Truly outstanding. However, they were 30 minutes late with our reservation on Saturday night with no managerial apology. Also they pack in the tables which is uncomfortable. Better check with the fire marshal, the place was seriously overcrowded."}
{"text":"We were in town tonight and ate here for the first time. I made a reservation and requested a table with easy access as my husband has mobility issues. This is a sweet restaurant owned by Ginger and Mario. They clearly take pride in their restaurant and treat all who enter like family. Ginger welcomed us and had saved us a table that was perfect. The food was delicious. The mushroom soup was amazing and the ravioli were yummy. Our server, Madison, was awesome and we also chatted with Mario as he was rolling out pasta. Everything is homemade. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite local Italian spot by far! The bread is seriously to die for and I'm not a fan of bread baskets usually. The antipasto salad was beautiful and fresh and the seafood pasta was delicious! You can definitely taste the love and experience in this food!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place. Went their on Sunday night with my bf after our disappointment that Marcello's was closed. The atmosphere was cozy and quaint and I was even delighted by a surprisingly not annoying live accordian player.  I opted for the special of the evening which was a pasta duo. Homemeade gnocchi in a creamy pesto sauce and also a mushroom stuffed ravioli topped with prosciutto. The gnocchi was to die for. Melt in your mouth.  I would have loved to try their dessert but two bottles of wine later and I was just too much of a stuffed monkey."}
{"text":"I took my family here for Mother's Day lunch/dinner and was thoroughly impressed with every aspect of our visit.  The service was so outstanding, the attitudes of everyone there was genuine, and the fresh pasta was delicious.  They even made a special accommodation for my daughter's meal of steak and cucumbers :) I will definitely be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Why does this place have 4 stars? Me and my girlfriend decide to order carry out and had high hopes because of the rating. I got Alfredo and she got the cheese ravioli. My Alfredo was so tasteless and the chicken in it was not seasoned at all. It tasted like Pasta with cream and boiled chicken. My girlfriends ravioli was ok and the sauce had flavor but was watery and still just ok. Not something you pay $50.00 for. The bread we got was burnt and the wedding soup I got was sitting the pot so long I am assuming because the noodles were mush and got one pebble sized meatball. Also the Cesar dressing for my girlfriends side salad was sweet? The only reason they got 2 stars was because the lady who rang me up was very nice. I hope the other menu items are better but I don't think I want to waste my money to try them. Bummed out because I was excited for this place."}
{"text":"Found this gem on yelp and picked up a to-go dinner order. A classic Italian dish and it was very fresh and made perfectly. The folks working were great and I would recommend anyone to stop in and try this place. I was satisfied and would return with confidence ."}
{"text":"Updated review 2/28/2018 Despite being very busy we were seated on time. They had a special dueling pianos night which was a lot of fun.  Service was excellent and food great. Also the Howling Moon pinot that was suggested was really great and reasonable cost.  Overall a great night   Previous review Must admit we still love coming here with the family. Overall it's a little more pricey than some of the other Italian restaurants around here,  Service has always been good with many of the same  face servers around which is always a good sign.  Also like the ambiance of the new extension / wine bar. Because it is so popular it does fill up quickly esp. on the Friday / Sat evening rush after 5:30 pm. We find it's better to reserve ahead and go early or go later say after 8 pm. The only disappointment is the lack of variety for vegetarians. my wife gets a little fed up with the lack of variety.  Marked them down a half star for that plus a serious mis-cue on the seating last New Year (or was it Christmas?)  - we had reserved a table, but still had to wait an additional 45 mins (because of  the apparent complication of seating a young child). Anyways forgave them that - just hope they have more vegetarian options in the future."}

Maybe someday I'll put together some sort of restaurant scoring matrix with weighted category rankings...

{"text":"We came in ahead of their dinner rush, and were seated promptly. Bread was served, which was moist and included two different varieties. Good stuff.  On the menu it says all fresh pastas are made in house daily. Although this may give the impression that all their pastas are made in house, in fact it is quite the contrary. It deceptively means that all of their pastas which are homemade, are made in the restaurant.... Oh, so it is a play on words in an attempt to trick the patron?   I was interested in a seafood dish and asked if the pasta in the dish was homemade and fresh. The waiter said in order to get that dish with the homemade pasta it was going to be $7 more than the price of the entree, which was already $20. So I am paying a third of the price of the dish for homemade pasta? No thanks. I then asked which of the entrees already came with the homemade pasta, and the waiter said only one dish had the homemade pasta. Despite the pasta situation, I decided to stay with the Fradiavolo with \"marinara sauce\" and asked for the noodles on the side.  We placed our order, were served our soups and salads soon, and received the Cannelloni and Fradiavolo shortly thereafter.  On the plus side, the mushroom soup was one of the best we've ever had. Very earthy, rich, and flavorful. If I had a hankering for cream of mushroom soup, and there were no other known locations for a great soup, I would likely come back just for that; kudos.  The Cannelloni, which was supposed to be \"baked in bechamelle\" looked as if the two crepes were baked, then topped with sauce afterwards. The meat inside was pale, and the dish seemed under-seasoned. We decided to switch it out for a veal dish.  The seafood fradiavolo, which was supposed to be in a marinara sauce (which gives the reader the impression that it would be thick like a traditional marinara sauce), was in a thin, broth-like sauce. Regardless, I was satisfied with the taste of the dish and the sauce, but the reason I ordered the dish was because I thought it would be unique with a thick sauce, whereas other restaurants typically serve this type of seafood dish in a broth-like sauce. The shrimp had the tails on, which I though was odd given that all the seafood was submerged in the sauce. In order to de-tail the shrimp I needed to get my hands dirty, which seemed out of place in this type of restaurant.  The replacement veal arrived soon. The sides were delicious, the veal however was not. It again was bland, pale, and soggy. Although the preparation of veal scaloppine should include breading and being sauteed, this veal seemed like it was almost boiled, rather than sauteed. The veal had a lot of white floating fat pieces, those that you get when boiling a chicken and not straining off the fat. Next, when cutting into the veal, a large artery was immediately found. We questioned the staff, and they said the veal comes in daily and is hand-trimmed. Well props to you, but if the veal is hand trimmed, wouldn't a large 1/4\" artery be easily found in a thin cut of veal?  Despite being let down with the entrees, we decided to try the Tiramisu. It was decent; we did not find lady fingers in the dessert. Instead it was layered with a more traditional cake. We are suckers for good Tiramisu, but we were let down.  Recapping: Good - Cream of mushroom soup, appetizer bread. Ugh - Bland and soggy meat, artery in veal, all the pasta is NOT handmade (expect to pay 33% more to get this in your dish), tails on shrimp in a sauce dish, and the small restaurant got quite loud later in the evening with the accordion player stopping at every table."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon, my Prime Times Social Club went to the wine bar at VinciTorios for our Color Outside the Wines Event and it was our first time having it there but, definitely not the last.  Service, food, venue, wine and location were all excellent.  Our server was Michele and she was super friendly and very knowledgeable about both the food and wine.  Offered some great recommendations.    Everyone loved the food, desserts and the wine.  The private room was like a little step back in time, so pretty!  My only minor thing was that Michele could've used an extra hand, she was really hustling.  Kudos to her for handling the group so well despite the difficult logistics.  Great afternoon at VinciTorios wine bar.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I realllllllllly wanted to like it but the food was just bad and the service way too slow.  Atmosphere: great, love it! Seriously cute Italian theme going on. This may sound weird, but I really enjoyed how beautifully the ladies room was decorated too.  The service was not great. We waited 10 minutes for our server to even show up and ordered as soon as she did. Appetizer took 25 minutes from then, and entrees showed up 25 minutes after that. So it was a solid hour until we had our dinner - that's ridiculous especially on a Monday night.  As for the food, the bread basket with different styles was delicious.... we were excited, thinking we had a winning choice... but then the positives stopped.  Everything missed the mark somehow. The iced tea tasted funny, mussel & clam appetizer was insanely salty, Italian dressing tasted vaguely of cleaning agent (?!), wedding soup was absolutely tasteless. The entrees were just awful. It was apparent they had been left under a heat lamp. My chicken had had every last drop of moisture sucked out. The plating was bizarre - who divides a plate in half using massive stalks of broccoli?   Complete bust of a restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Took my mother here for her birthday dinner. Had a party of 8. Great atmosphere and our server was amazing. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here again in November around Thanksgiving. It was a special dinner, since my family was in town and we used to go to restaurants like this back East. Everything was delicious, our waitress was excellent (and it was a busy night and she had quite a few tables!). We ordered far too much for our tummies but that's what to go boxes are for! I ordered the deep fried ravioli again and it was as yummy as I remembered.We also ordered a pizza and it was wonderful. Drinks were kept filled we didn't go without anything, and I was thrilled that my family could have a great experience."}
{"text":"If you want delicious Italian food, a nice wine list, great atmosphere, amazing music, this is the place to be. The owners, Mario and Ginger, treat their guests like family. OK food, I don't eat meat, so for you veg friendly folks, the ravioli is amazing...ask for the spicy marinara. The eggplant parm is perfect! Save room for the tiramisu. It is fluffy and decadent. The Music - live jazz on Thursdays. Other nights Sarah has the sweetest voice and a great variety of songs. The music is not obnoxiously loud so you can enjoy the music and a little conversation. Service - I have always had amazing service. Especially when I request Marcie. She is lovely, friendly and knows the menu and wine list like a boss. I have to admit, I have a garlic bread problem. I eat way too much of the garlicky warm bread. This a great neighborhood hang out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Italian cuisine, VinciTorio's is a must try. My roommate, who lived in Italy for a year, says that their food is the real thing. No diets allowed here.  Their Burrata e Pere is a great starter mixing sweet and salty with a combination of cream cheese and pears wrapped in proscuitto. My favorite dish is their Agnolotti Carbonara, which is ravioli stuffed with chicken and sausage in a cream sauce, topped with bacon. Like I said, be prepared to have a real meal here.   The owners are visible on most nights and have pictures of their trips to Italy up for customers to view. The wait can be longer on weekend nights, but they have an excellent patio and bar to enjoy a glass of wine while you wait.   Additionally, the wait staff is incredibly patient and friendly. My friends and I have closed down this place on quite a few occasions and have never been met with an impatient waiter trying to shove us out the door."}
{"text":"This is a really classy little spot, an awesome change of pace for lunch. FYI - The bar area is a great place to dine too. I will re-visit for dinner soon as it sounds amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great for a date night or lunch with the girls.  Only complaint is that it gets so loud in there sometimes it's hard to hear yourself talk.  If they could fix that, I would definitely give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"Our first time visiting, and we had a good experience. Michelle was very attentive and sweet. I had the chicken parmesan which was very tender and flavorful. My boyfriend had the special of the night a fettuccine Alfredo with ham, peas, and mushrooms. Which was very tasty too. A hint of sweetness from the ham that really made the dish just the right flavor. We will defenitly be returning."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is the bees knees! My boyfriend took me here and was surprisingly outstanding! Everything was house made, Pasta, pasta sauce, bread, salad dressings and cannolis!! Enjoyed every bite. If your looking for good Italian most defiantly give this place a try! And save room for dessert or take some home."}
{"text":"The results of an informal poll of my dinning companions could best be described as a shrug. The pasta and sandwiches we had for dinner were passible, but I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"We went to Vincitorio's for a birthday dinner last night, and it is a wonderful restaurant. It's an old-school classic Italian dinner house, with cozy traditional decor, delicious uncomplicated food, good service, and a fabulous wine list featuring a wealth of wines from all regions of Italy. On a Tuesday night, the place was packed, yet it was still quiet enough to carry on a lively conversation. There are specials throughout the week and evenings with live music."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix. Awesome sauces and great paste. Classic Italian ambiance. You can dress causal or dress up. Service is outstanding and good wine selection. I like their Cheese Steak Sandwich as well. They always have light, live music at night as well."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday night at 5 PM for Dinner to celebrate my Brother in law's birthday. This place looks very cozy and looks to represent what a restaurant would look like in Italy . We ordered the Antipasta which was a plate of meat , tomato , cheese , olives , the olive oil they used really put together this dish to make it amazing.  I ordered the chicken Parm  to share with my wife. The meal came out already split into 2 places for us and equally portioned out. The food was very fresh and did not seem like any corners were cut. Afterwards we ordered the Tiramisu dessert . That cake was insanely good. The presentation was 5/5 and the taste was 5/5 it was fluffy , creamy , melts in your mouth goodness. Finished it off with a shot of espresso. Oh yeah , there was also a gentlemen playing live music( accordion)  that was walking around to different tables making this place very romantic at the same time."}
{"text":"My cousin was in Phoenix on business and we made dinner plans. He was up for Italian, so we went here. And it was yummy in the tummy. But a more detailed explanation...  For a Wednesday night, it was a tad busy. By a tad I mean there was a 20-minute wait. The waitress took our order, but the kitchen was slammed and it took awhile to get our food. I think that's just a testament to its popularity, plus we had some catching up to do so I wasn't in a hurry. Plus, they brought plenty of garlic bread and the attendant was so attentive he kept our water full. They had a decent wine list, but I couldn't have any due to an early interview the next morning. My cousin had a ravioli dish that looked really good, but I opted for the broccoli/garlic/basil/tomato stromboli, and I was happy with my decision. It was actually too big for me to finish, so I took home some leftovers. It had a good mix of flavor layers and blending. The dessert menu looked good too, but I was entirely too full to have any. The decor was cozy and romantic, and our waitress was very nice. The only downside was the interview the next morning, which meant I couldn't have a glass of wine. As I'm sure there will be one, there's always next time."}
{"text":"Super nice people and great service.  Went in for a Cheesesteak at lunch and ended up trying their Salad bar/Buffet. It was great!!  Good flavors and well made pasta dishes. Good meatballs, all around good food. Beautiful atmosphere.  Never even knew this was here and i've passed it no less than 300x.  Def worth checking out."}
{"text":"The good: Love this place, atmosphere is great. The food is excellent: calamari  is crisp, always an interesting special, bartender is great (if you sit at the bar).   The issues:  Someone needs to do wine training: make sure you pre order champagne, or it's going to be served warm in an ice bucket.  Make sure you don't get a wine glass fresh from the dishwasher or your wine will reek of Clorox.  Overall I've been here many times and have had mostly great experiences."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place, so I hate to say anything against them.  The atmosphere is also really nice, and they have top-shelf live music a couple nights a week.   Unfortunately, the service is terrible.  The worst part is, when you're getting take-out, they swipe your card and collect your tip before you find out just how bad the service is going to be.  I'll go back because I love the food and the atmosphere, but it's a shame they don't put the same premium on customer service that they do on everything else."}
{"text":"Horrible food & service. We went there because we had seen it on trip advisor. They use SYSCO food. Smelled that stink when I walked in the door. Caprese salad: NO organic tomatoes? Ever heard of Burrata? How about some organic basil? Waiter could not figure out how to manage wine? We're out, large table, ever hear of offering in advance? Will NEVER go there again. For those of us from SF, NY or hey how about Italy, where real Italian food is served. This SUCKED."}
{"text":"I love this place & truly want to give it 5 stars but it truly is a solid 4. It's the best italian food in the area by far, but by no means is this great italian food.    The service was friendly & the place is nice & cozy. We had the fradiavolo & the lasagna, both of which we enjoyed & would have again.  Luckily we came on a wednesday evening which happened to be half-price wine bottle night. This is probably their best feature, every bottle on their menu is half off, no matter the listed price. And their selection is easily one of, if not the best selection of italian wines in the area.    The night we were there they also had some live music going, I'm usually grumpy & stay away from bars & restaurants that have live music since it's loud & interrupts conversations with my fellow guests, but this was nice and did well to add to the ambiance of the restaurant.    Overall, I'm happy to recommend this place & look forward to returning to this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I don't understand. We saw the place on Check Please and heard other people rave about it. And honestly it wasn't anything amazing. Sorry.  From the start to the end it was bad.   If you are a wine drinker you probably will enjoy it. Their wine list was 20 pages long.   When we first walked in, it's a very narrow tight space. Whom is guessing was the wife of the owner greeted us asking us how we were. I said great, how about you!? She then just stared at me. Continued to stare. So I said, table for two? She says something like okay. Name? I'll call you when we are ready for you. No direction as to how long it would be. Where to wait. We decided to check out the cute stuff they sell and we were just constantly in the way since the kitchen door was right there. so we saw a bench outside to sit at.  It was weird to see people bringing food out the front door to bring to the tables on the patio. I was waiting for a crash.  We got sat maybe 15 mins later. Not bad. But got sat on the patio. Uncomfortable plastic chairs and wooden bench. Our server was in the weeds. I think he has the entire patio for himself. He never took the time to explain anything to us. And when we ordered he constantly was looking around.  After he left I told my husband I hope he got our order right. He didn't repeat it back or confirm it.  One lady took our drink orders once we sat down and brought us our sodas. Very flat sodas. Our server then brought out two more. Saw ours on the table and placed them on the \"bar\" next to us. He later gave them to us.  Cream of mushroom soup came out. It was definitely cream with a couple bites of slices mushrooms in it.  I ordered the shrimp and salmon pasta special husband ordered a pizza.  My entree was decent. I enjoyed the sauce that was with the pasta. The description said jumbo shrimp. It was 3 pieces of small/medium at best over cooked shrimp. And probably one skinny piece of salmon that was sliced into four pieces. It was fishy and watery. I know we are in (AZ) and can't get fresh seafood but I've have plenty better salmon. The pasta was said to be homemade but I wasn't certain it was. But I'm not a pasta specialist.  My husbands pizza was ok. He described it as being wet. Not sure if it was the grease or overload of toppings.  In the end, while we waited for our check. We overheard the table next to us say their check was wrong. They got the table next to theirs check by that table already left and paid in cash. So Always check your check. Apparently they paid the wrong one.  Ours finally came out and to end it the server didn't give us a pen and never came back. Luckily I had one. Because who knows if they would have gotten paid.   Alright. So in the end. Too much decor going on made the space really small. We saw a group that got sat separately. Half the group inside and half outside. Service needs to improve. But I kind of get the feel they don't care about the bad service since the wife started it. So I don't expect that to change. We saw the husband running around. According to the menu, Mario was the pasta maker. How cool would it have been for him to walk around and great people. Tell them all about it?  Won't be back. Didn't see what the craze was."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, good food, great service! Cream of mushroom soup was amazing, main course was good, panda cotta was except for dessert. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"A great little restaurant that once inside doesn't feel like it's in a strip mall or next to an auto shop. All the food I've tried is been great just ignore the little kitchen gift shop upfront but seems out of place. My piano music on the weekends is a nice touch in the atmosphere is lively and upbeat. Great date spot."}
{"text":"We've eaten here before and the food has always been wonderful.  We called ahead to make a reservation on Saturday night.  We arrived a few minutes early and checked in.  And then we waited. And waited and waited.  Several other parties checked in and were also waiting patiently.  We were a party of three and there was another party of two waiting.  Not once did they apologize for the delay or offer us a water or soft drink... We finally left when after waiting almost 40 minutes a party of six walked in for their respective reservations and immediately got seated!!! Completely unacceptable.  We saw the table,  there was room to separate the tables and seat our party of three and the other party of two comfortably, however they didn't make that choice.  That's when we decided to just go somewhere else because they completely lacked customer service skills."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, won't be going back!  Food was tasty, but the cursing and very boring music made the experience one that I would not subject myself to again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love trying  new resturants and we usulaly check yelp as a resource. We visited the resturant about a month ago and we really enjoyed how friendly the staff and owners were. They were attentive and the food was mostly really good. The Chicken Scarpara was our favorite. We tried the handmade Ravioli and it was also good but the Chicken Scarpara was excellent it was not a dish either of us has had before and we love spicy and it had a kick to it. In fact I am planning on meeting another firend there tomorrow night and taking my husband this time too. Nice to see a local resturant that greets and meets their customers. As a Persoanl Chef myself I believe ti makes all the difference the presentation and the feeling of the resturant and of course the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Our favorite Italian restaurant. We go from fountain hills just to go here. We LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Well turned to be another embarrassing lunch sojourn. I took a bunch of my colleagues here promising them a lip smacking Italiano experience. Boy were they miffed by the end of this endeavor. We started of good with their garlic bread which was liked due to it being warm and fresh.   we decided to order the \"try your combination\" pasta dishes instead of the lunch buffet. I ordered the angellini with red clam sauce and my colleagues went for various combination of the Alfredo.  Now understandably alfredo sauce is a disgrace to authentic itallian cuisine but being in the States i wasn't very perturbed when the orders rolled out from their olifactory orfices. However when they did come in I must say it was one of the worst sauces I had ever tasted. They hadn't reduced the heavy cream portion of it properly and it tasted like I was chugging on  heavy cream (what happened to the garlic). If this was Hell's kitchen the chef 'nee' cook would be whisked out of there so fast, probably with a ladle stuffed up his nether region for good measure.  My concoction of sauce and pasta was decent (but how hard is it to put together tinned clams , tomatoes and onions)   I put 3 stars but it actually deserves none ,due to my clam cioppino I had tried during their dinner service"}
{"text":"The BF decided to take me on a date tonight (Woot!), and we chose to try this place. I'm really glad we did! The place is cute, despite being in a strip mall with a dollar theatre. We had to wait, but only a few minutes and got a table on the patio. Unfortunately, it was right by the door so we had a lot of people hovering around us while waiting for tables, but it was ok.   They brought out some really good garlic bread, focaccia, and slices of a baguette in a basket which was really nice. I got a glass of their house pinot grigio (without remembering that I could have gotten it free with a coupon... i felt stupid) and the BF got a Peroni off the tap. The alcohol was priced well with the wine at 6$ and the beer at 5$. We ordered the bruschetta, and it was good.. not the best we've ever had, but good. It didn't have any balsamic on it, so that would make it a lot better. For mains I ordered the gnocchi and the BF got a chicken caesar salad without dressing (I hate when he makes me feel unhealthy...). Mine came with a salad and it was good, it had creamy italian dressing which I love! More places should have creamy italian....yum. The gnocchi were delicious, really light and had a really good tomato basil sauce. The BF enjoyed his salad, but a salad without dressing is kind of hard to mess up. We got the tiramisu for dessert and it was really tasty. It came with chocolate sauce all around and strawberries on top. Again, it wasn't the best tiramisu I've had but it was good.   The service overall was nice, the waiter was timely and did not bother us much. He didn't come by to ask how our food was, but that was fine with me because it all was fine. The food came out kind of slowly, but it was nice to have a leisurely meal.   So overall, I'm a fan, but it's not the best. I'd go back, though, because it is close to home, reasonably priced, and tasty. The whole meal only cost 50$ before tip, and we were both very full at the end, so thumbs up to that!"}
{"text":"High end Italian restaurant.  Homey feel. Make their pasta and sausage on site each day. Bread basket is to die for... food is excellent.    They had a young woman singing was we came in.  Great for business dinner or to impress a date.  Reservation is a must...busy place. Do your self a favor and try them. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"VinciTorio's is very good.  I have thoroughly enjoyed Their linguini and white clam sauce now twice.  Yummy ravioli too.  Great service and value.  The lemony dessert was amazing.  I impressed my date by taking her here.  Maybe we should have gone back, because she totally lost interest not long after.  Oh wait, that's not what Yelp is for.    VinciTorio's: recommended."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding service was a little so but in their defense it was crazy busy!!! make a reservation because they fill up fast on the weekend"}
{"text":"Last night was the second time I've been to VinciTorio's. I am now officially obsessed with this place. It's just a few miles from my house, and tucked away in such an unassuming complex. The husband chose to surprise me and take me there for our \"We met 11 Years Ago Today\" anniversary. So, I put on my dazzle jacket and a pair of heels and we were off.  There was a short wait, and the host gave us this tip: make a reservation for Friday night. It gets a bit crowded, so you might have to wait. We hung out outside (passing on the offer to have a glass of wine) until our table was ready. When we entered, the place was buzzing! There was a musician with a guitar singing at an incredibly reasonable volume - something we were very appreciative for. There's nothing worse than going out to dinner and having live music, only to have to shout at the person you're with to get a conversation going. The food was FANTASTIC. Husband tried the fettucini with chicken and asparagus, and I decided to step out of my pasta comfort zone (angel hair and sausage) and try something I'd never had before: butternut squash ravioli in a 4 cheese sauce. UH,MAY.ZING. and BONUS -- the ravioli's were HEART SHAPED!! Overall, it was a gorgeous night. Great service from our waiter, fantastic music and delicious food. Also, was introduced to the owner, Mario, who was so charming. He mentioned they make all their pasta fresh and on site and said his gnocci was the best ever.  I can't wait to go back and try the gnocci!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just went here for our one year anniversary and we are extremely pleased with our experience. The service was as Amazing as the food! Mario and Ginger are great! Will be back for sure and would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Went there for a work event/dinner.  Having done my research on Yelp I wasn't sure what to expect.  The good: - the honey/mascarpone/fig/prosciutto bruschetta.  The tiramisu - very good indeed. The not so good - the pasta.  I had the angel hair pasta with sausage and peppers and it was just very bland.  Scott Conant would not have been happy with how overcooked the pasta was.  I tried one or two other entrees my colleagues ordered and they were also bland and the pasta was cooked too much for my tastes."}
{"text":"We wanted to begin our new year with delicious food, and instead it began with INADEQUACY. We made a reservation more than a day before and yet we had to wait 50 minutes for our table. FIFTY MINUTES. You'd expect after such a delay tasty food. Instead: bland, delayed, messy and served with no enthusiasm. The price did not match the purpose, our expectations did not match reality. One thing we weren't served? An apology. We award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."}
{"text":"I have found my go to Italian restaurant in Tempe, one word to best describe it would authentic!  Linguine Vongole was amazing, but the hand made Cavatelli Al Forno was out of this world!!! The best pasta I have had in quite some time.  Enjoyed dinner sitting in the bar and Cody took excellent care of us.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, over cooked and bland. Did not enjoy the food at all. On the bright side, the ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for great Italian food.  Mario always treats us like family when we are there.  It's not good enough to have great food these days.  It's even better when you can't help but RESPECT the place and it's owner!"}
{"text":"We came here last night and I thought the food was awesome. Sis had a cup.of the mushroom soup and loved it and same for me with my wedding soup. We shared a cheese pizza and it was a pretty decent size for small. The crust was crispy and a little chewy. Loved it. Mom had the chicken parm which came with broccoli as well. She had plenty to take home for lunch today. Brad was our server and was a saint with the iced t. He eventually just left a carafe on the table after we had drank so much. He was very busy but very nice and we enjoyed our visit. We all cant wait to go back and try new stuff! My only complaint would be that it was sooooo tight. To the point where Brad had to reach over me and ask this young ladys date to hand her food to her. Awkward. It was also the day after Valentine's day so they, (the couple next to us), were on a date and we were practically seated at the same table. There was a little boutique with lots of cute stuff for sale but once again, we were in every servers way as we looked at the stuff because its such tight quarters. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's day, and they had so many tables packed in there, it was hardly a romantic date. Our table was in the walkway next to the door that led to the patio, so every time someone came in or out, we had to move. We were also so close to the couple next to us, we may as well have been on a double date. There are tons of wine options so no complaints there. The food was good and is made from scratch, but Caffe Boa is better."}
{"text":"Decided to try on a whim and was not disappointed.  Great service with awesome food. My wife really LOVED the mushroom soup and nearly licked the bowl clean . Her cheese ravioli was very good based on her feedback. I had the saltimbocca al la romana and it was delicious! Both our kids loved their kids meal, so that's always a plus. The wine selection is quite extensive with many options available by the glass. The piano player is a nice touch for the perfect background to make this a very nice evening. Even better that he we playing my favorite Coldplay song - clocks! We definitely will be back. For desert, we ordered the Tiramisu. For my wife, it didn't have enough coffee flavor, but I thought is quite decent. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food with a great room for meetings. We hold a bi-monthly networking meeting 1st and 3rd Wed of the month. The 20 of us enjoy this location. Our group is called RUN."}
{"text":"Wow! I got a taste of Italy in Tempe, AZ! Can you believe it! From the moment I got to this place I knew the night was gonna be memorable! There was a small wait with outdoor seating and the wait service, which happen to be the owner's wife, came and took our drink orders while we relaxed outside! That was nice!   It was a special birthday dinner in my honor and my BFFs took me there as a gift! What a gift! They had live entertainment which set the ambience just right! The lighting in this place was dim but very romantic. The food was spectacular! I had a seafood pasta called Seafood Fradiavolo with mussels, clams, shrimp, & calamari! It was the best dining experience all the way down to dessert and coffee!   Besides the great food and environement the one thing that makes this place most memorable is the family atomosphere. There are great black & white photos of the famiglia all over the restaurant! And the owners (husband and wife) though hard at work the whole time still make an effort to greet and say good-bye to their customers just like you are dining in their home!  I can't say enough good things about this place! But if you go, I promise you will remember it!"}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot and liked it, but after a couple of so-so experiences with the food (nothing special, lots of oil, pasta drowning in too much oily sauce) we stayed away for several months. Tried it again recently and it was just as bad, if not worse. Disappointing because it's a neighborhood place and we like to support family businesses, but I think a little more effort needs to be placed on the quality of the dishes. It seems like no matter what I get it's just overly rich, too oily and bleh.   Also, the price on the dishes when you get a simple pasta with pesto adds up in a hurry. With wine and stuff, spending $100 for two?  Hardly felt worth it at all for that money we could get a much better meal elsewhere. I sincerely do hope it gets better because the people are nice and the atmosphere is great!!  And they do have a terrific wine selection. I think maybe the only way I'd go back is to try the fun looking wine bar."}
{"text":"VinciTorio's is my favorite neighborhood restaurant.  The food is amazing and the staff are always friendly and knowledgeable.   The owners, Ginger and Mario, are the best.    I always feel welcome, regardless of how busy they are.  The pizza is the best pizza I have had in the East Valley.  We order a pizza from VinciTorio's at least once a week.  On Wednesday nights they have half off bottles of wine.  You get to choose from their amazing wine list to go along with your expertly prepared meal.  I have tried almost every item on there menu and I have never been disappointed.      All in all a great neighborhood Italian Restaurant."}
{"text":"After reading Marta B.'s glowing review I had made a mental note to revisit this place since it had been a while.  After having dinner there with my husband last night,  I am giving them an extra star because of the improvements that they have made over the last year or so.  First is the breadbasket.  I do believe they served a sliced baguette with olive oil and balsamic vinegar before.  Now they have a basket brimming with all different kinds of bread.  Garlic toast, pizza dough rolls brushed lightly with tomato sauce and parmesan, focaccia bread baked with fresh herbs... and so on.  The only thing I would like to see is something with a little crunch like grissini or lavosh.  The other improvement is the addition of more desserts.  Maybe I just don't remember but I think that the only desserts they had before were the balls of gelato in various flavors coated with chocolate (sorry, I forget what they are called) but now they have many Italian favorites like cannoli and tiramisu.  The other new thing is that they now have live music.  I think the accordian player was there on our last visit but at the time I was annoyed because we were having dinner with old friends and didn't want to have to talk over the music.  This time it was just me and my husband and so we very much enjoyed being serenaded \"Lady and the Tramp\" style.  I think the food at this place is great but not blow-your-mind-fantastic.  It tastes very authentic and homemade... which is a good thing and a bad thing.  Sometimes having something be too homemade means that you feel like you are paying good money for something you could have made yourself.  Other times, when you just want a good meal without any exotic ingredients or fancy finishes then this just hits the spot.  My husband liked his food more than me but was a little disappointed that they charged him $7 to add chicken to his pesto pasta and didn't warn him while ordering that there would be an upcharge.  He also had an upcharge for a Cesar salad (this was disclosed on the menu) so we actually paid $50 for our food (not including beer/wine) which is a bit much for what you get, imho.  Overall, it's a good meal in a cool environment with great service so I will definitely try not to forget about VinciTorio's again.  If you are in the mood for their very unique atmosphere then you will have a good time."}
{"text":"I loooooove the patio here. It's very cute and a little intimate. Then menus with family photos are adorable. The service was superb and the limoncello flute was beyond perfect for this Arizona weather. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All recommendations were right on. Marcie was the greatest! We had the Ravioli Di Zucca and Stuffed Pork Chop... Appetizer was Burrata Pears.. Delicious!!! We ended with Tiramusu. Everything was so satisfying. We sat in the Piano section and he played all of the songs we requested. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This place is great. Very authentic atmosphere and great service. The price is a tiny bit high but you won't regret it when you've finished.   Also: get the tiramisu! Made from scratch in-house--best we've ever had."}
{"text":"I used to go here years ago when it was a casual cheese steak sandwich shop. They sold the business 6 years ago and redecorated the place to a small intimate Italian restaurant. The food is great. Cheese-steaks here are still delish! Service was good, and I loved the singer accordian player. Until next time- yummy dreams!  PS- They have Gelati here that is good. We had the Hazelnut chocolate one- sigh!"}
{"text":"It is hard to come by great Italian, but this place hits the mark with their food.  We went on Winewednesday and bottles of wine are half off!  The atmosphere was perfect, they had a gentleman playing piano and took requests.  The service was good , not great, but don't let that stop you from going to eat here.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp when I was looking for a dinner spot close to Tempe Marketplace to catch a movie later in the evening. Per the other reviews, I thought it might be busy on a Friday night so I called two days in advance to make dinner reservations for 4 at 7:30.   Our party of four arrived at 7:28pm and checked in with the hostess. I was initially relieved that I made the reservations because the place was packed! The hostess said they would come find us when our table was ready so we took a spot standing near the cute merchandise they have for sale and expected maybe a 10-15 minute wait. Luckily our conversation entertained us because before we knew it, 20 minutes had gone by and we were still waiting. We waited another 10 minutes before checking on our table since they were busy but when we did, we were informed that our table would be ready shortly since 5 tables were nearly done. Fine. As we continued to wait, we were approached by a very intoxicated woman and had to endure a very awkward conversation with her. Clearly not the restaurant's fault but maybe someone should have cut this lady off before we had to hear about how her father made french toast?! We finally finished our 50 minute wait and were taken to the bar side of the restaurant where we were placed one table away from the entertainment that evening. It was a middle-aged piano player who talked more than sang and was having a full on conversation with the table next to us. Had we not been waiting for 50 minutes already and didn't have a movie to make in an hour and 15 minutes, I would have demanded a different table.  At this point, I was hoping the service and food were going to make up for this rocky start. Unfortunately, it didn't get much better.   Our waitress showed up after a several minute wait and took our drink order. She was clearly busy but definitely not overly friendly or accommodating. I cautioned my dinner guests that we would need to order ASAP if we ever wanted a chance to make our 9:30 movie and we all picked out our dishes and ordered the next time she came back to our table. Once we ordered and our drinks arrived, we were served garlic bread and I must admit, that was some of the worst garlic bread I've ever had. There was absolutely nothing special about it and it was like someone took out the fluffy, good part of the bread and seasoned the crust. Blah.   By the time our food arrived close to 30 minutes later, it was clear we had no chance of making our movie. The food was okay but I don't think even the best Italian food at this point would make me want to come back here. The piano guy finally took a break and we were able to have a nice conversation without yelling over him and just decided to enjoy our dinner guests rather than rushing. We didn't end up leaving until most of the place was cleared out (about 10pm) and don't recall ever being offer additional drinks while we chatted.  I do know my water glass was full all the time. At least they got that right. On the way out, we were thanked by 4 different people sitting at the bar as we left. Really? Where has the great service been all night? Apparently sitting at the bar. We will never be back."}
