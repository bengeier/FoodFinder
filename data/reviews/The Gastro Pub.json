{"text":"I love this restaurant . The burgers are the best in The Beach in my opinion. Expertly crafted and hand made.  You can add whatever you like. I tried avocado and caramelized onion. Delicious. Salads with attention to detail.  Caesar with extra good homemade croutons. Village salad is chunks of vegetables and lots of feta cheese.  Portions are generous.  Last time I tried chicken carbonara which was loaded with grilled chicken and creamy white sauce      My husband had the steak dinner. Properly cooked and not pre-marinated!   The chef is the owner. I think it's new ownership.  There's a front patio. The inside is diner decor...old records, well-worn furniture.  It's just east of pubs which are always crowded.  Give this place a try. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Had dinner here twice before I could make a proper review.  First time was when they just opened in the summer. They were just getting on their feet, but I had an amazing experience! First of all, they have a great selection of local craft beers which everyone enjoyed.   For appetizers, we got the chicken tenders and Hawaiian Yorkies. The dips (and all the sauces) are all made in house, which blew my mind! The Hawaiian Yorkies were really yummy and unique! If you like bacon and pineapple, you have to give this a try - all the ingredients came together so nicely in the Yorkshire pudding bowls!   They have daily specials, and I got the Po-Boy Saturday special. So much shrimp and deep fried greatness! Including nicely sliced deep friend pickles!!! Needless to say, I was stuffed.   I don't actually remember what dessert we got, but the owner gave it to us on the house. I'm not really a dessert person, but it was also made fresh that day which I always appreciate, and it delicious!   In terms of ambiance, the first time going there it felt very much like an old school diner, which is what it used to be. They have cool retro booth seating, and the staff are all nice and eager to give you an excellent experience!  A few months later I heard about their grand opening on social media, so I went with a few friends. First of all, they decorated the place really well! They complemented the retro diner feel with a lot of vinyl's and album covers on the walls, which really made it feel more classy and \"pubby\".  Again, we were able to experience more local craft beers which we loved! But this time, they had a special grand opening menu and free tapas!! We ordered everything on the special menu, and also got a classic Chicken Souvlaki.  Beet Salad: Never really ate beets in my life, but the presentation was beautiful and my friends who eat beets said they were good haha!  Wasabi Green Salad: Don't remember exactly what was in the salad (also not a salad person), but the salad dressing had a tinge of wasabi which was amazing! If I'm going to order salad, it's going to be this one. Definitely want this to be a regular menu item.  Mussels: Oh my God we ordered so many the kitchen ran out... and then we got some bread to finish the sauce. It was a bowl of mussels in a red tomato broth, but it was super fresh and delicious! Please make this a regular menu item!!!  Chicken Souvlaki: I usually only order this in Greek restaurants, but I found out the owner is Greek so I had to try this! It was the best chicken souvlaki I've ever had! The chicken was so flavourful and oozing with juice, and not only did I get tzatziki but I got a classic lemon sauce too which was really unique! Highly recommend if you want a solid and safe dinner choice!  Didn't get dessert this time, but I'm definitely going here at least once a month! Can't wait to try the whole menu!!! Oh and I'm not a brunch person, but they have all day brunch!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit to this new Beach eatery. Lovely decor and wonderful music. Lots of Beach Boys among other classics.  Friendly, responsive staff.  Wines are varied although one must ask for provenance if various ones, ex Sauvignon Blanc?, house red and white, etc.  Management still deciding on which ones to go with. Suggestion was made to post details.   Reuben sandwich was a big hit, along with crispy fresh-cut fries.  Beet salad on bed of spinach with pickled beets, goat cheese and balsamic dressing was plentiful and very filling.  We will return for sure."}
{"text":"The Gastropub is my favorite Beach's hangout!!! The food is all hand made and tastes amazing!! Whether you're grabbing a bite with friends or sitting at the bar chatting with the owner, the look and vibe makes this a great spot. With vinyl hanging on the walls and some of the best 70s music mixes, everything about it keeps me coming back for more"}
