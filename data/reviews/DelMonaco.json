{"text":"Bought tomato sauce the other day with some meat tortellini to take home and cook. The sauce was absolutely terrible. Basically, it was puréed canned tomatoes. No taste. Threw it in the garbage. Much prefer the tomato sauce at Pastamore at Marché de l'ouest. As for the tortellini, it was ok but some were pieces were hard. Maybe their pizzas are good but it's the last time I buy sauce and pasta from there. Too bad because I live close by and buy for 2-3 meals a week."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best cannoli in the Greater Montreal area, even better than StLeo! Pasta is good too. Friendly staff. Smells real good inside too, they should take the scent and bottle it... Would be the number one hit at the Bay! Pizza is really good too, my fav cold pizza in the west island. Haven't tried their lasagnas or coffee yet but hopefully I'll be back soon. Would I recommend this place for my friends and family? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Excellent ciabatta, great Italian takeout sandwiches.  Excellent fresh and frozen pastas and sauces - brilliant cannelloni!  Catering or takeout."}
{"text":"Only had their plain Italian tomato pizza. I'll stick to my usual place I order from on sources. The dough was dry and hard."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Pizza is always fresh - whether you order ahead of time or just drop in to pick up.  The staff is very helpful and always friendly :)"}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza!! Enjoyed every single bite of their onion and olives pizza! Also chowed down on some amazing cannolis! Definitely worth a visit."}
