{"text":"I came here with a large group for all you can eat sushi and was GREATLY disappointed!

The vegetarian rolls that I ordered were mediocre at best, and many of my friends who eat fish complained about some of the rolls being disgusting (apparently the fish was not fresh at all). 

My biggest complaint about this restaurant is the service, though. The waitress had NO idea what she was bringing out to us, which was extremely annoying, especially as I can't eat fish and had no idea what was in some of the rolls. At one point I had to pick up my plate and walk over to the sushi bar to ask the man making the sushi what it was exactly. The waitress also barely knew English which was a big problem in terms of communication about the orders, and many of the things that I ordered were not brought out to me. 

Overall, the only nice thing I have to say about this restaurant is the decor. I should have paid attention to the prior reviews of this place, but having come low expectations, this place still disappointed me. Definitely not coming back!"}
{"text":"Like the previous review stated, this place is now called Nikada.

After looking at a few glowing reviews throughout other sites, my friends and I decided to try it out for Friday lunch.

While we weren't expecting much for an AYCE sushi lunch, I didn't realize it was possible to be this bad.

All of the rolls were soggy and tasteless, the fish on the sushi all tasted really old and watery. The cooked items, which most of the other reviews praised were even worse, the beef and chicken tasted really sour and weird, it was either rancid or just seasoned really badly.

You can expect the usual AYCE stuff here, the menu is mostly the same as the other places, and they'll probably only give you 70-80% of your order, again, pretty common.
Lastly, this is not really a complaint but just to inform other people, pop is not included on the price unlike some other places.

At $10.95($12.99 Fri,Sat) for lunch AYCE, you really cannot expect much, but definitely a lot more than what Nikada can offer.

I'm cross posting this to warn people about this place, not to put it out of business, but so that they can improve. I don't think places should be able to get away with serving this quality of food.

Oh yeah, the decor was pretty nice."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! What a big mistake!!

Mikado really should not have switch their menu to AYCE! The quality of the food really went down so much that it is not worth my while to go back.

I was there on a Saturday evening and the restaurant is 2/3 full. We were seated promptly. However it took so long for our food to arrive. The kitchen is so slow, since there is only 1 guy working there! 

The steamed egg that was so good before now just a 1/2 full with no seafood and the egg all crumbled into pieces.. The dumplings are the worse I ever ate, they are so hard and dried. Sigh.........

The waitress tried so hard but nothing much she can improve their situation because when you have only 3 workers (1 sushi chef/1 Robata chef/1 Kitchen chef), the food took so long to arrive. The shrimp tempura still the best I ate in any AYCE took over 1 hour to arrive!

The oyster is still good but now it is a lot smaller size than before.

The spider roll and green dragon roll were well prepared, the crab and the eel inside tasted so fresh.

I feel really sad how Mikado being a restaurant with so much potential become one of those AYCE....."}
