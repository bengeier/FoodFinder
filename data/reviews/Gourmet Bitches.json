{"text":"Try the chicken wings when it is available. It's quite tasty. But it is not always on the menu."}
{"text":"Did not eat there too recently but when I did, the wait was excessively long.  I don't kind waiting if the food is amazing, it was not.  Disappointing food truck experience.  Burger seemed like it was from frozen."}
{"text":"Awful, just absolutely terrible....
These girls have no idea how to cook, run a business or talk to customers.
Rudeness,  absolutely lack of customer service and any kind of respect for each other.
Add tasteless food such as: dirty oil soaked fries, absolutely dry and rubbery pulled pork on stone cold bun and to finish it up soggy grilled sandwich made of wonder bread and god knows what else. 
PLEASE do not waste your money or your nerves with these people.
Very sad as their are ruining the reputation of Toronto food trucks."}
{"text":"Was turned away from their truck in Liberty Village today. They claimed they were closed because it was \"dead\". It was 1:45 pm. They were scheduled to be there until 3. 

Way to commit ladies."}
{"text":"I wanted to rate this truck awhile back to say their supposed \"jerk chicken\" tacos were the blandest tacos I've ever eaten.  It was the first time I actually wanted to just toss food away!  Not worth the hype, the line, nor the price!  Yuck."}
{"text":"Fries with steak on top loaded with fancy flavors? Yes please! The Bitchin' Fries were precisely as described - and not at all akin to the wannabe gourmet poutines found across TO. The beef was beautifully sliced, seasoned, and just rare enough to sink your teeth into. Perfect amount of salt, cheese. The lemon balm buttery herb topping was the clincher here. Because of it's presence and it's lacking ability to last forever, I nearly licked the container. Portion size was fair, I just really really wanted more! Blood Orange San Pellegrino was a refreshing departure from the cokes and root beers on other trucks. Other menu items were sold out at 2 AM, nbd.

So maybe the girls on this truck could work on their professionalism a tiny bit.....I get it, they are bitches or whatever....it was Nuit Blanche....it was super late.....but still. They cut off the line because they needed to restock - perfectly understandable given the extreme conditions that Nuit Blanche presents. But when they got blank looks from the dazed art-goers who had been patiently waiting in line, they shared this gem: 

\"We need to like prep and stuff, unless you like, wanna eat raw meat, that's fine with us.\"

ahhhh Gourmet Bitches. I love your snacks and quirks. Keep putting luscious steak soaked in a dreamy lemon balm concoction on top of my french fries and you can talk to me however you want."}
{"text":"Had the double smoked bacon sandwich at the wychwood barns today. 

The bacon was undercooked and chewy, and there must have been a pound of salt on there. They paired it with pickled purples radishes or beets that just added to the salt. 

The lineup was at least a half hour, staff was really bitchy, so they live up to that part of their title. They should just drop the gourmet from there. 

They were also rude to my wife who asked for some ketchup on their strangely spiced and soggy fries. 

Altogether a write off. Sorry, bitches!"}
{"text":"I walked outside around Liberty village and was delighted to find a food truck in the area.  I had to give them a try due to the fact that I never know where they are all the time, so I ventured into a line about 15 people deep.

From what it looked like there were 4 ladies working the truck, so I wasn't expecting crazy fast service, these ladies are working really hard.

First of all, if you look at their website you'll read that the owner has been developing foods that are dairy, gluten, soy and spelt (no idea what spelt is) free.  I personally didn't know this until after, but after tasting it kinda makes sense.

I ordered the fish taco combo (which was 2 fish tacos and some salad).  Personally I found the tacos really dry.  They almost tasted like dried fish that was lightly breaded and pretty much had a consistency of a cracker.  The corn taco was alright, but what they really needed to do with this taco is introduce some moisture into it.  I think if they charbroiled it it would be less \"crackery\".  

The salad was alright, it's salad... But I do like how they added kale and raisins into it to mix it up.

I'm not sure if I am not a fan of gluten free food or if it was just how it is, but I personally didn't really like what I got.  Maybe I'll try something else next time?

PS. I wouldn't give these ladies that hard of a time as it's really stressful as they're preparing some pretty gourmet items in a very confined and fast paced industry."}
{"text":"NOT good. :(

Just got the PLK (still not even exactly sure what's on this thing) from there food truck parked at King/Spadina.

The pork has no flavour. I just ate a piece of pork only, and it has absoultey no flavour at all. 
And the bread? YUCK. 
I don't like the sweetness, as it's all I can taste, because the bacon (???) has no taste at all.

What a waste of $9.

The fries were good, but they're fried. And they're potatoes, so it's hard to screw those up. 


I was truly hoping this would be tasty. I'm STARVING, but I don't even think I'm going to eat the sandwich. It's *that* UNgood. :( 


Pass on this food truck."}
{"text":"Night two, round two of the TIFF food trucks. These guys were the most disappointing of the tacos I've eaten. I was excited to try these based on the name: Bitchin Hibiscus Beef Tacos. The tacos come with hibiscus vanilla bean beef, greens and tomato salsa on a corn tortilla. While the hibiscus was a refreshing change of flavour there was just nothing really much beyond that to hook me on these tacos. At 3 for $10 the price was ok for the smaller sized taco."}
{"text":"Gourmet Bitches was one of the many food trucks on the island for the Nike Women's 15k and I had met the owner on a local run earlier that weekend, so I was definitely excited about trying them out.

They had two options on the menu a fried chicken sandwich of some sort or avocado toast with your choice of bacon, egg, or smoked salmon. I went straight for the toast because avocado is all my all-time favorite and what better way to have it then with some bacon.

The girls on the truck were super nice-- I originally ordered bacon on my toast but after seeing an order with egg come out I figured the smartest choice as far as fueling post-run would be an egg, so I went to change my order but she must have saw the major reluctance on my face and offered to put a little bit of both on for me.

The toast was delicious!!! Looks can be deceiving...at first glance I was worried it wouldn't fill me up but I finished full and happy. Price was a bit steep at $10 but it was really flavorful (bacon was thick-cut and amazing) and I was more than happy so it was worth it."}
{"text":"FISH TACOS were delicious
Not big on fries personally so opted for the kale salad and loved it 
Got a chance to chat with the owner and the quality of ingredients (besides the gluten free that everybody knows) are amazing.
She really knows where to get the best of the best that T.O has to offer. 
Good to hear the city lightening up on food trucks because this one is amazing !!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this new food truck...the menu items looks so fun....so disappointed!
The price was too much for the small portions and the food tasted BAD! I could have almost forgiven them and shrugged it off as maybe I picked the wrong food choice but was SOOOOOO sick when I got home...for sure the food was bad!!!
WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!! Not worth it people...hit up pizza pizza or subway instead because that is gourmet compared to what they are serving!!"}
