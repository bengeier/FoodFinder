{"text":"Today I came back to the pepper sauce restaurant after having lunch with a friend . He was ranting and raving on how  delicious the breakfast was so I thought I would have to see it for myself. I had the country fried steak and eggs. My waitress Nelly recommended the potatoes O'Brien it was so delicious. she did an Exquisite job and very professional."}
{"text":"Cheerful place and friendly staff!  Good breakfast spot.  We had chorizo burro and huevos rancheros; they were solid presentations.  Not really fair as we've been eating killer Mexican in  Ensenada, Mexico recently.  Hope to come back for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 3 minutes past 2 and was told they were closed. I said it was 2 and they told me \"Too Bad\" I said I just wanted something to go and I was told the kitchen was already shut down. Is this how they treat customers? I will tell everyone not to ever go there."}
{"text":"Great food the tuesday special is one of my favorites chicken fried chicken"}
{"text":"Met my friend for lunch here today. AWESOME cafe! Easy to find, great service & the food was DELICIOUS! I had a chicken melt & my friend had a Philly cheesesteak. We shared dessert! We will DEFINITELY be back to try some other stuff! Some burgers were on the way to a table and they looked REALLY good... Nicely served on a pretzel bun. Don't pass this little gem of a cafe up!"}
{"text":"I don't go very often because of my work schedule and their hours...but when I go, I am never disappointed.  LOVE the Texican Burger! My husband thinks you should add an egg to it and call it the Texicano..lol...either way you leave this place with a satisfied tummy and money left in your wallet.  I took a day off today just so I can cheat on my diet with the Texican...Thank you Peppersauce cafe!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for a conference this week and was taken here by a local. Very busy on a weekday lunch, and service was quick. The Crispy chicken salad was delicious!"}
{"text":"My company has ordered from them a few times now and we are a big bunch!.. Always great hot food, pleasant owners and staff!. Food is very good, So far everything we ever ate was delicious. I would recommend them and they are a decent price range too! Try them you will love them as we do! Karen"}
{"text":"Eat Here!! The service is fast. The food is hot and absolutely delicious! The meat is fresh and flavorful. The soup bowls are big with flavors to die for.  Anything with their pretzel or paremsan bread will wake up your taste buds.  Eat here!"}
{"text":"We come out to phx for spring training games and we would eat breakfast here every day if we could. Have not tried lunch yet. The service is great also. Cassie is our favorite. She is the best person we have ever met. And if you need a police officer seems to always be some in there. Don't pass on this place."}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant quite often, years ago. Didn't realize that they were open again until I read a fellow yelpers review about attending recently. My team at work wanted to do breakfast together, so I hastily suggested that we go to this cozy spot.   I called ahead to inform them that a semi large group was coming. They said they would get a table ready and let the kitchen know. As I entered my first thought was that the place looks so nice inside! They have cozy little tables that look refinished from what I remember. I suggested the chicken fried steak and eggs to everyone because it is apparently to die for (and it was!). Many members of my team ordered it and those that didn't looked longingly at it as it passed under their noses.   Our waitress was very friendly and gave suggestions as needed. She didn't seem to blink an eye that it was such a large table. The food came out quickly and was very yummy! She broke up the check for us, no questions asked.   I am so excited that this restaurant is open again! I will definitely be going back as it is right near work (although that could be a bad thing!)"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict are perfect every time. Portions are large enough to keep you going well into the lunch hour. Don't let the fact it's off the beaten path fool you. Staff is great!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast this morning staff did an  excellent job would highly recommend this restaurant for anybody looking for a great home-cooked meal!"}
{"text":"Wow the Texican Burger & the garlic fries were REALLY good. The whole staff was really friendly every server that walked by asked how we were doing."}
{"text":"We met with friends - as we all were going to baseball spring training.  I was in charge of our dining options.  It was a little tricky following the Directions.. Anne St. Is marked at the turn as Raymond St.. However.. Above the Raymond is a quaint handmade sign saying Anne (Anna?). It was worth the confusion on our part in spades!  Those who ordered burgers and sandwiches were declaring it their food as outstanding.  Our daughter ordered the fried chicken plate AND their homemade chili.. Best chili and she offered me some breast meat.. Which was in-craz-zee wonderful!  Thin crust that was decadently done.. The meat was hot, juicy, and deliciously moist.  Everyone was very impressed!  We all declared Peppersauce as a go-to place for a great experience!  And, our trips to Phoenix will always include Peppersauce Cafe!"}
{"text":"I go here for their Grilled chicken salad. Mango iced tea is awesome too. Great service. Food is a bit expensive than the other places."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place for lunch. the other day and I'm so glad he did. It's off the beaten path but that doesn't seem to have hurt their traffic. They offer breakfast and lunch and have a pretty loyal crowd, but they're happy to see new faces too.  I had the tuna melt on Parmesan bread yum. The tuna is mixed with diced celery and sweet pickles, and it comes with bacon and Swiss (I 86ed the tomatoes ... big surprise). The french fries were fantastic! My friend went with the Thursday lunch special, which was beef burgundy tips over egg noodles (aka stroganoff), and didn't say a word from the time he leaned until his plate until it was all but licked clean.   Drinks are self serve and I like that they brew their own ice tea - it's the good dark, teeth-staining ice tea that I loooooove.  To call this place a \"greasy spoon\" wouldn't do it justice. And, it definitely deserves a return visit."}
{"text":"Peppersauce Cafe is one of my favorite places to eat. Though there are many amazing dishes here, my favorite is the pulled pork sandwich. It is topped with onion rings and is FANTASTIC!. I discovered this restaurant about 3 years ago when I was working in the area. I have taken many customers and friends there for lunch. It's a real home cooked meal for just over the price of what you would get fast food. The staff is courteous and remembers who you are. I think that's important for businesses.  Anyhow, Peppersauce gets two thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Really good food, super friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Never had any food that was horrible. Sometimes really good sometimes just ok. Unfortunately I think my visits will be few and far between. The prices seem to increase more and more. For $15-$20 just for myself at lunchtime I can go somewhere much nicer. If prices weren't so high I would keep going here for pure convenience but I'll drive a few miles down the road to save $10."}
{"text":"I really like this place for lunch. I have had the Reuben and Meatloaf sandwiches. They both were excellent. Good Cole slaw as well.  The service is friendly and very efficient.  It is located in an industrial and has somewhat limited parking in their lot but the side streets help out in that case.  Lots of down home food done pretty well. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meatloaf dish. Comes with mashed and corn. Plenty of food for lunch at a very reasonable price.  All the food is good here."}
{"text":"At first glance and the area its in your like I am not going in there! but man what a surprise!! food was great and the staff was friendly. great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. It was pretty busy so service is slightly slow, took a little over an hour for lunch.  The food is a little overpriced for what it is, but the quality is good. I got the grilled tuna steak salad. The tuna steak itself was a little over done and dry, and the salad was mostly iceberg lettuce, but it was passable. A little heavy on the cheese, but there were grapes in the salad and that was a nice touch.  My friend got the Thursday special, beef tips over noodles. He goes Thursday almost every week so, needless to say, he's a huge fan.  I would note, if you want a quick lunch pick somewhere else for sure."}
{"text":"Great hidden lunch gem.  Have been here several times, and will hopefully be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken cordon blue sandwich to go. Tricky. The chicken was crispy and delicious and the food carried very well. Good food off the beaten path."}
{"text":"The Texican Burger with tots on a pretzel bun is amazing.  Overall it's a great lunch place with a little bit of outdoor seating. Inside it is a little noisy and cramped. Staff is always very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here frequently and the quality has gone down lately.  I had the Meatloaf and it was not so good.  That visit was a couple of weeks ago.  This last week we stopped for lunch and I ordered a burger.  The patty tasted like the frozen ones you buy at Safeway.  Really??  Come on guys, put some effort into it.  It was tough and tasted like it had been frozen.     Peppersauce could be a great place but it seems like they are cutting corners......"}
{"text":"Good food. Place seems a little hidden, but I like places like that. :)  They put green grapes in their side salad! Omg, it was soooo good! I really like their meatloaf too. Nice cafe to go to during my lunch break."}
{"text":"Crazy busy lunch spot!  Why??? Their food is amazing.  Forget the diet and just enjoy a fantastic lunch.  Be ready to talk loud though.  The customers are as hearty as the food."}
{"text":"First impressions: found this place while traveling through yelp.  Walking up to the place it is well kept, but there are bars on the windows, don't let this scare you!  Once inside the place has a clean country farmhouse charm to it.  If every industrial park diner was like this place they wouldn't have such a bad stereotype. Also, the ladies room was nice and clean and there was lotion, always a plus.  The food:  although my dining partner was disappointed to find sausage patties in lieu of link sausage, he ordered the pancakes with boysenberry syrup and I ordered the Phoenix omelet, no cheese.  The pancakes were big and fluffy, standard flapjacks.  The syrup was boysenberry flavored, there were no fruit bits and extra frills.  The omelet that I ordered was not what came to the table.  I at first received the pepper sauce omelette, which looked good if you like cheesy creamy dishes, but not really my thing....   They took it back and the kitchen promptly whipped up the correct order and I happily ate away at a surprisingly fluffy omelette for something made with chorizo...     If the order mix up was the only problem, I would have probably still given the place 3.5/4 stars since the food came out so quickly the first and second times, but at checkout time the server forgot to adjust the check and the bill had both omelettes charged.  This couple with the extra time and annoyance of waiting to pay at slow checkout leads me to drop the rating another star.    Summary:  all in this place has the potential to be a pleasant neighborhood diner with the basic breakfast items well covered and lots of friendly faces, but on my particular visit the service ball was dropped, rolled into the street, and then never really recovered.  I wanted to like this place, but it just didn't come together."}
{"text":"Had lunch here while my car was getting repaired, as it was the only place within walking distance. I'm so glad I did! Everyone was very friendly, and my food was ready in about 5 minutes. I got the Reuben, and it was delicious. A great little local place."}
{"text":"Arrived just about the time this place filled up and that was around 11:40am. So much for the beating the crowd idea. Waitress said it wasn't usually this crowded. Still, about 20 minutes later, I had my Turkey Poblano melt and homemade potato salad. The salad had chopped radishes and green peppers which was unusual and the salad was served nice and cold with chunky potatoes. Everything in and around that melt was also quite good. The turkey quality could have been slightly higher, otherwise it pretty perfect. The parmesan bread was the highlight and the layers of mild poblano, pepperjack and bacon went together well. Let it cool and it is even better. Overall nice experience in this building that used to be a house and is in an unusual location in this area. Chicken salad looked great also on the way out."}
{"text":"Our team chose this place to have breakfast 2nd year in a row before our team build activity. I guess we spend so much time together we're starting to think alike because all 6 of us ordered the same thing, the chicken fried steak, gravy & eggs! Six people can't be wrong, we all cleaned our plates! I thought it was better than my usual favorite go to restaurant for chicken fried steak breakfast. This place appears to be a little hole in the wall Cafe but it was certainly busy, has great food and service to match,  one of those tucked away places that is a must try!"}
{"text":"A decent lunch spot with restaurant service in a fairly industrial area.  I would give the wait staff and atmosphere 4+ stars as it is a very comfortable little restaurant to have lunch at, whether it is with co-workers, business associates, friends or by yourself.  However, for the food I'm giving if 3 stars - nothing wrong with the food, but nothing great with it either.  Decent diner food, not many options to eat too healthy too (you need to be creative if you're watching calories!).  I eat there a few times a month typically, so I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I had the Texican burger en route to the airport. It was delicious. The chuck-chorizo combo was a nice change, and the pretzel bun was pleasantly soft. Definitely a recommend!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here numerous times. Really like the staff. They work as a team like I have you rarely see. The food is fantastic. Good comfort food is what I go here for. I had the chorizo burger last time I was there, out of this world."}
{"text":"Great lunch stop. Friendly staff, food is quick, but still feels like a sit down experience and not a fast food stop. Salad with grilled chicken has a delicious mustard vinaigrette dressing. Affordable priced."}
{"text":"Just had my first meal at The Peppersauce Cafe. I ordered the Peppersauce Patty Melt. I consider myself a patty melt connoisseur it was amazing!!  The tater tots could have been cooked just a tad more. The order was ready when I walked in the door this is really great as I only have 30 minutes for lunch. I will make this a regular place for lunch."}
{"text":"DELISH! This is a hidden gem but so glad I found it! Great service when I pick up my called in orders and everything I have ordered has been amazing! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat here a lot as it is close to my office. This place has the best sandwich of all time. The Turkey Pablano Melt!! It is fresh sliced turkey, pepperjack cheese, roasted poblano chile(not hot), on parmesean encrusted, sour dough! Ohhhh it's awesome. It is pretty greasey but man is it delicious. The service is great complete with big smiles all over."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with this place. I got the Texican burger with tater tots. The meat on the burger tasted OK but I found several unchewables in it. I did like the pretzel bun though. They didn't bring out enough catchup and I could never flag down the waitress to get more before I finished eating them."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Simple menu with enough options to satisfy anyone with either a sweet or savory breakfast craving. The food was hot and good. I got the chicken fried steak, which wasn't my favorite (I'm kinda picky on how I like mine) however was sill.good. the eggs were cooked perfectly which I appreciate a ton because I hate snotty whites and these over mediums were snot free. Good seasoning on my hashbrowns. Hot coffee. Great little breakfast nook that is easy to.get to, has great atmosphere, good service, and quality food"}
{"text":"Peppersauce has reopened under new owners.  My wife and I stopped by for lunch yesterday (Thurs) with four other friends.  Were greeted by the owner.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere is relaxed and homey.  Everything spotless and clean.  This place, locaded in an industrial area is so nice and home like.  Quiet and peaceful.  Leave the hustling world behind. Restaurant has breakfast and lunch--open 6:00 to 2:00. Wife and several of us had the special which was tri tips in burgundy sauce on a bed of noodles.  Simply delish.. One of my friends who loves hamburgers, in fact that's all he eats out is hamburgers, got the peppersauce burger which he declared excellent.   My wife got a ruben which she said was very good.  It came with slaw which she said tasted \"old\". Tea is brewed from real tea and was delicious.   Was a really good meal for us all."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the middle of a very busy industrial area.  It is right off of 40th Street and the I-10 just a bit North.  The food is top notch.  The staff and service are amazing.  I am fortunate enough to live near by and try to go as often as possible.  My biggest recommendation is the Chicken Peppersauce Sandwich, with pastrami, with added poblano chilies.  It comes on an incredible Pretzel bun.  I prefer yellow mustard to the house sauce. The coleslaw is a great accompaniment.  They post specials each day on their Facebook page.  If you see the grilled tilapia with mango salsa as the special, I recommend you run down there.  They might run out of the special and you don't want to miss it.  It is some of the best grilled fish I have had."}
{"text":"This place has HUGE portions. Definitely a good deal for the money. The location is fairly small and hidden, so it wasn't busy at all when I went during the workday. My coworker told me this place is owned by a couple of sisters, so that I cool. The food was good, and I would definitely return"}
{"text":"It was just okay.  I didn't have a hard time finding it.  The house/building isn't as cute as say Cibo or House of Tricks.  My husband and I shared a breakfast burrito with green chilies, tomatoes and peppers added to it.  It was edible but I have had better.  He had a side of fresh corn beef hash.  He didn't seem thrilled with it.  The service was great.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back though.  That makes me sad because it is a breakfast/lunch place near my home so I really wanted to love it."}
{"text":"Peppersauce is a local treasure. I'm actually mad I didn't know about this place sooner. Everything on the menu is amazing, but the breakfast is just on a different level. Come with an appetite for sure, because you will leave stuffed. I have to come in at least once or twice a week. Love trying different items on the menu because I never leave disappointed. Great food, great service, and just an all around delicious local cafe."}
{"text":"Once again I certainly recommend this quaint cafe great selection of breakfast dishes and good service"}
{"text":"Nice little family style restaurant around the corner from my office. Food is always good and wholesome. I always try to look for places like this and I am happy it is here!"}
{"text":"Super cute ambiance it feels like you're at someone's house. The food was pretty good but this yelp is more for the service although they were busy Nellie was kind and sweet. Thank you for brightening my not so good day.  Ps the fried chicken is soooooooooo good."}
{"text":"This place is a great little hole in the wall! I had their pepper sauce chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun and it was really good! My server was great besides she was a local girl!(rarity) and to show you what kind of people dine there, as I was paying my bill three military personnel walked in and sat down and I watched a gentleman walk over to the server and tell her politely that he'd like to pick up the tab for those three! It was truly an awesome thing to witness and it made my experience even that much better at this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great breakfast, very pleasant decor.  All in the middle of a nowhere industrial area."}
{"text":"This shop is unique,   staffed with friendly servers and the food's legit.   It's loud in here... and the dining room is small,   and on weekdays expect them to be busy in spite of the tucked-away location."}
{"text":"Not many places to order in this commercial area, however this place is small but delivers and provides a large amount of yummy food."}
{"text":"I guess the new owners of been here about a year. I checked the other reviews and see some were under the old ownership. Was really surprised to see how good this burger I had was - just ordered the daily special - they make their own burger patties and this 1 was the jalapeno bacon cream cheese. It was awesome."}
{"text":"Wow this place is a hidden gem. Tried their pastrami melt and it's way better than most places in NYC."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch for work. Great food even better service. Nice small spot great for lunch. Had the roast beef with mashed potatoes and corn. Very high quality food. Will definitely go again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Small family style restaurant with floor to ceiling wood paneling which gives the place a very homey/country/comfy feel to it. Restaurant appears to be a former residential home in the middle of a industrial section of Phoenix. Patrons are a mix of blue and white collars.   Food: Comfort food with Southwest bent. I liked the Turkey Poblano Melt.  Service: Super FAST! They moved the lunch rush with amazing efficiency.  Overall: Great little lunch spot to check out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Small place, very hidden. Food was great. Service was friendly. It's pretty popular, every time I've gone, it was packed."}
{"text":"I went there with my friend who really likes it.  I ordered  an $8.50 Reuben that had three wafer-thin slices of corned beef wadded into a ball in the middle to provide the illusion that there was some beef on the sandwich.  I pointed this out to my not-so-friendly server when she queried my satisfaction with the meal.  She said, in a snotty put-upon voice, \"Well, we weight the meat for every sandwich!  Every sandwich gets four ounces!\"  It was clear this one was way under and when I pointed this out she said, \"do you want more meat?\"  I asked if I was going to be charged - she said \"Yes!\"  I said no thanks and now my mission is to dissuade anyone who cares from ever going to this place."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever. I wish I would have discovered this place a lot sooner on my Phoenix trip. I plan on having breakfast there every day my next trip. Please is extra clean and service was awesome. Food tasted fresh and was full of flavor. Great experience."}
{"text":"I stop by the this place every time I'm in the Valley. Great omelettes. Potatoes done right. Good price. It's right off the 10 at 40th, so it's extremely convenient."}
{"text":"Months ago I had the most sublime pudding parfait at this restaurant.  Every once in a while at work we would wax poetic at how we would love to have \"parfait day\". Every once in a while I would ask while picking up food when they were having parfait's again. They asked for my phone number and I then forgot all about it. Friday at work I notice on my caller id that Peppersauce just called me.  I said aloud at work that omg....parfait's might be in our future today. I called back and YES!!! it IS Parfait day. I quickly asked around work and almost everyone wanted one. I called and placed my order for 6 and ran out the door. They were so nice and happy that I was so enthusiastic about them. They packaged them up perfectly for travel and absolutely made my Friday special."}
{"text":"I get what they're doing here; it's a greasy spoon off the 10 in an area overwhelmed with manufacturing facility and construction company neighbors. They pull that off excellently but don't get your hopes up for much more.  What Peppersauce has going for it is excellent service and serious cleanliness (we saw the health inspector have a bite after performing her inspection during our last visit -- good sign). The menu isn't going to impress your hipster pals but, let's be honest, that isn't their main clientele.   Definitely a good spot for a morning breakfast meeting if you want to get your nearby industrial client away from his office."}
{"text":"My first time stopping in, I was hoping for breakfast because I know their breakfast is always on point, but they stopped serving breakfast  at 10:30am during the week.  I decided to order The Texican burger, and holy moses I was absolutely blown away.  Take it from a guy that loves chorizo breakfast burritos more than his wife, the Texican is half  beef, half chorizo with their signature sauce and avocados.  Best burger I have had in a long long time.  Pretzel bun was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. A little gem in the lovely area of south phoenix. Lol. Its tucked off the freeway, cant really see it from the road. My dad has gone here for many many years, and my old boss used to eat here, that's the only way I knew of the place. The little cottage house is just darling.   THE PROS- The food is AMAZING. And on top of that, the staff is awesome too. Everyone is friendly prompt and efficient. I've never had an order wrong, I'm a picky eater who always either adds or takes something off from the menu version. I've only gotten two items here, and am totally content with that!! Highly recommend the Tuna Melt on parmesan bread, with provolone cheese and tomatoes. I'm drooling thinking about it lol. Also, the buffalo chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun is just as yummy. You HAVE to get the sandwich on the pretzel bun!!!!   THE CONS- Holy crap does this place get SUPER crowded. The place is so tiny, and popular, it easily gets over stuffed. The tables are close together, and it can definitely get loud. They also are only open for breakfast and lunch, so don't wander in here past 2.   I would definitely recommend this place, ide say its even worth driving out of the way for. Just be careful if you're trying to come here on your lunch. If you only get 30 minutes that's not going to cut it."}
{"text":"My coworkers recommended thus place and I am glad they did. I arrived at 12:30 and was finished by 1 pm. I was greeted by a wonderful hostess and she directed me to a table by the window. She said I looked like a guy who knows what he wants and I responded that this was the first time I had been here. She recommended quite a few things, one if which was the peppersause hamburger.  I choose that with pepper jack cheese and fries. I had only waited for about 5 minutes and here she comes with my burger. It looked awesome!! I was smothered with melted pepper jack cheese and it was on a pretzel bun. The service was  wonderful as was the food. The fries were seasoned perfectly with oregano and season salt. Yum!! I recommend coming here for lunch. When I left, I paid about 10 dollars for lunch. Great place to eat. Wonderful comfort food! !"}
{"text":"Very nice people, excellent food. Had the meatloaf platter, mashed, sweet corn and a roll, gravy, excellent. Great peanut butter cookie dessert. Fair prices. Clean place, I will return..."}
{"text":"What a great find!  I came here for breakfast. As others have mentioned it is tucked away in an industrial area. There is nothing fancy here but it is clean and bright and neat. Service is very good and the food is excellent. I had the Cowboy omelette which was superb!  Steel cut oatmeal also!"}
{"text":"good diner type food. quick, friendly service. good sized place, so usually no waiting even though busy. some interesting menu items like the texican burger, a burger with chorizo mixed in. also daily specials. I would go again."}
{"text":"We came to this place based on the yelp reviews!  The location is off the beaten path and the building looks very suspicious but once you walk in you know you picked a great little lunch spot.  The service was really quick and extremely friendly.  I had the chicken melt and it was good, the tatter tots were so crispy and delicious I could have just eaten a plate of those! The chili was great but a little spicy for my taste.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"After nearly passing Peppersauce because of it's unique location, I finally located the trendy little hot spot. Trendy by a long shot, but what a hole in the wall it is! The ambiance is like your Grandmother's house during Christmas, depending on your family it might not apply to you, but it is welcoming, loud, and everyone is smiling. I love Yelp for this very reason, it links you up with the best place in town. Back in the day, I wouldn't have been able to locate this place because it is behind the freeway in an Industrial Park but today, I drove right up, walked right in, ordered my sandwich and enjoyed every last bite.   The staff is friendly, I felt like a million bucks walking out of that place. My shoes were complimented, the women introduced themselves by name, and asked where I worked and sent me on my way with take-out menus. I was hesitant to get take out because what if I didn't like it, or what if they didn't pack the ketchup I requested, so right as I walked out I peaked in the bag... they didn't forget a thing not even down to the extra seasoning on the fries.   Sitting back down at my desk to eat this glorious sandwich has enticed me enough to write this review because it was so close to perfect. I will be going back. I can't wait to go back, is it tomorrow's lunch yet?"}
{"text":"I have been here several times because it is a favorite go to place at my company due to its proximity.  They are open for breakfast and lunch only. The lunch food for me has been consistently terrible.   I cannot recommend it for lunch."}
{"text":"Good lunch specials. Good service, alright prices."}
{"text":"Tucked away in an industrial area this Midwest style gem is not to be missed.  They offer a nice selection of menu options.  Quality and taste are both good.  Service is good.  Quality!"}
{"text":"I have now been to this restaurant 5 times. I have taken my staff, my wife, a client, a vendor and just stopped for breakfast one day.  Always good, always friendly! It is also always very busy so go early; it is worth the hunt to find it."}
{"text":"Came in today and tried the Chicken Basil Brie Sandwich. (Special) This sandwich is not on the regular menu, but it absolutely should be. I would order nothing else and I like the food here otherwise. The salads are fantastic, the this sandwich with blackened chicken, salad greens and. Pesto was off the charts delicious. If it is suggested, please try it. You will want it on the regular menu as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!  The crispy chicken salad was exactly what I wanted..  So good, fresh, and a little spicy chicken..  These guys make there own salad dressings.  I could tell because the honey mustard was bomb digity.  This place made me feel I was back home in rural east Texas..  Happy eating Y'all!"}
{"text":"Love this place, close to the office industrial area, you will never find it unless you know its there. One of the only places that has meatloaf. Open limited hours, but its packed when its open. Everything is sooooo good. YUM"}
{"text":"Delicious home cooking at its finest!  Great food paired with amazing staff and ownership is what keeps me and friends coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on a Friday with a coworker for lunch and was very impressed. It's very hard to find because it's in an industrial zone right by the freeway and off the main drag. So make sure you get good directions. The restaurant was very clean with plenty of parkings. Always a good sign! The waitress got us our sodas right away. I ordered the Texacan burger which consisted of a half pound of beef and chorizo with avocado and pepperjack cheese. Delicious! My friend ordered the hamburg patty melt which he also loved. Their french fries were perfectly crispy and it happened to be their third anniversary so we got free chocolate chip cookies and free drinks. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came in today for the first time and spoke to a wonderful host.  I said I found this place on Yelp and she asked me to give a review, so here I am.  Thinking 11:15 would be ok for lunch time to beat the crowd, I could see the place was already packed.  I had to park a good distance down the street.  Keep in mind this place is not easy to find.  Once inside, I ordered for take out.  I got the turkey poblano melt with fries.  It was maybe 10min before my order was ready.  I grabbed it and headed back to the office.    One thing that made me real happy was that their fries were nicely seasoned and not too crunchy.  I ordered them based off the pics I've seen on help.  I ate my fries first (I'm weird that way) and then enjoyed the sandwich.  It was delicious!  So juicy with each bite and sadly I wolfed that thing down in a matter of minutes.  I am now stuffed... haha. So worth it.   I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches, Salads, and Fries! Very friendly staff. A bit small during lunch hour rush but worth it!"}
{"text":"I come back here again and again, and not just because it's close to where I work while in Phoenix.  The thing that keeps me coming back is the consistency.  The food has never let me down, the turkey sandwich is my go to.  I really like their potato salad.  The customer service is always friendly and fast.  And the peanut butter cup cookie is a dangerously delicious thing to behold."}
{"text":"Been going here now for a few years.  Great food.  Great service.  Lunch is pretty busy but they can normally get you sat down pretty quickly.  They are only open for breakfast and lunch.  Prices are fair.  This is one of the few places that actually give you the option of tarot tots instead of French fries.  Got to love that. Will continue to go there and recommend."}
{"text":"I so love this little restaurant. I came here yesterday for a order that I had called in. Nicole is who helped me.  She was very pleasant to speak to on the phone as well as in person. The customer service was great and my food was ready when I got there to pick it up. The food was A-MA-ZING as well. I ordered the meatloaf sandwich with friesh. The portions were large in size,  it was enough for me to eat twice. The sandwich was very well seasoned and so we're the fries. I will continue to come here for lunch whenever I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"1st time having lunch here, THIS finna be a BREEZE! It was. It was delicious. Peppersauce burger"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now and I've never been disappointed.  The food is always good and the servers are quick.   So far my two favorite items are the Peppersauce Burger with pastrami and the Peppersauce Patty.  Even as I type this my mouth is watering and I just had the Peppersauce Burger.    The burgers are well done and still juicy!  I always leave stuffed and happy.  The burgers can be a little on the greasy side, need two or three napkins.  I've also had them when you only needed on napkin to clean up.  Either way it was still tasty!  I've seen a couple of people get salads and they are huge and look good.  The servers have always been friendly even when it was really busy."}
{"text":"The Peppersauce Cafe is one of those small, local gems that serves up delicious breakfast and lunch in south Phoenix. Just off of I-10 and 40th Street; this place quickly became the breakfast/lunch  go-to for myself and several co-workers. The service is that of a neighbor or friend that just loves having you over, and we all enjoy getting to know the staff a little more, each time we visit.   We stop in about once a week now, so the waitresses already know that our entire party usually orders their insanely good Grilled Chicken Salad. Why 'insanely' good, you ask? Well, on its own, this salad is fantastic. But what really sends it over the top is their honey mustard. Honestly, I'm not sure what's in this stuff, but the honey mustard over here is like nectar from the Gods ;)   On the other hand; if you're in the mood to breakfast, their omelettes are packed with fresh ingredients, and the burritos are excellent as well. You can't go wrong  with a side of either hash browns or country potatoes to compliment your choice."}
{"text":"This very cozy cute cafe is a little hard to find, even though it's right off 1-10 and 40th st.  If you are a fan of independent unique restaurants, you should like this place.  The food is good, the atmosphere is even better.  All wood, very cozy and quaint.  I usually get the chicken sandwich which comes with avocado and bacon, and their fries are fresh cut.  It is comfort food at its best.    I have heard their breakfast is great, but i believe they are open only M-F 6:00 am - 2pm (closed weekends).   If this is close to you for lunch/breakfast during the week, you shoudn't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Peppersauce frequently for about a year now and it is always good food.  They have a daily special which is always good.  They generally have pretty decent seating that can handle a group of 6-8 and its easy to get 4 in. The food is maybe best described as trucker food.  The got lots of different hamburger and chicken sandwiches as well as meatloaf, Reuben sandwich and other tasty lunch fair.  The portions are generally huge and just in case you are still hungry, they have some cookies you can buy on the way out.   Like the name of the restaurant implies they have a decent variety of peppersauces on the tables, such as Habenero Tabasco and Cholula. With a meal, a drink and tip you will get out for about $13-14 per person. (Although I am sure you could go cheaper, you really wouldn't get the experience.) They are also great for breakfast.  I generally split their breakfast burrito with a friend because its so large. My 5 star rating represents a \"best in class\" rating.  Sure there are other places I'd rather go given unlimited time and funds but for a good comfort food meal, this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This cafe is sort of hidden away and only open until 2pm but it's great. Real friendly staff, and delicious food. I recommend the Peppersauce burger."}
{"text":"WHOO HOO . . . My 100th Review  This place was definitely a great choice for a 100th review . . . I would have hated it if it was a bad review . . . but . . . this place rocked.  We were seated quickly and our waitress took our drink order . . . told us of their lunch specials and returned promptly to take our order.  For me . . . Iced Tea, Pastrami Melt with French Fries and a side of Coleslaw.  Iced Tea was fresh and clear and ice cold . . . Coleslaw was crunchy with just the right amount of dressing, not limp and watery . . . French Fries were hot, crisp and firm . . . and the Pastrami Melt was down right heavenly.  My only reason for not giving five stars was the noise level . . . there were times that I could not hear my lunch partner speak . . . I may be a little hard of hearing, but I am not that bad . . . This place is definitely on the I'LL BE BACK list . . ."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good service.  Tiny parking lot.  Try the Texican!  Ground beef and chorizo.  Yum."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for lunch. The Chicken Peppercorn Sauce sandwich was outstanding. Dining room was small and compact. A bit loud, but had a nice small ma and pop ambiance. Will definitely go back and try again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch,,, 1st lunch at this place and i have to say ,, The Teriyaki Shroomer was delicious !!!   A tad greasy at the begining, but awesome flavor,,, def a goto lunch spot ,,,,   Thanks again to the staff there,, !!! great job.."}
{"text":"It may be tough to find, and the lunch service may take just a stitch over an hour, but Peppersauce is the best homestyle greasy spoon south of the airport.  Nestled in an industrial neighborhood, Peppersauce is the perfect blend of kitsch and delish that a old school cafe should be. The service style is a bit different--you generally don't wait to be seated, but can grab a table and your own drinks before being waited on. Service is spotty and definitely diner-esque, but the girls are very friendly.  There is really only one item on the menu that i order...the veggie reuben. It is a delicious mountain of sauerkraut topped with cheese and dressing on perfectly-grilled, buttery rye. It definitely ranks in the top ten sandwiches of all time for me. The fries, are ok, and the side salad is pretty good too.  If you are willing to navigate the industrial park to find it, you should give peppersauce a try."}
{"text":"Quaint place with friendly service and good food.  Daily specials for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I had breakfast there the other day and they were awesome! Great staff, great cook, just kind of place I was looking for. This is my new \"go to\" breakfast place."}
{"text":"I always say if their fries are good, then their everything is good. Lunch special: extra thick bacon with grilled jalapeños, guacamole, lettuce, tomato on a toasted toll with some aioli I believe. Absolutely delicious and fast with some efficient service. Great find!"}
{"text":"I tried it out because it was near the airport and I like to try new places. It was okay, but not close enough to the airport to make it worthwhile - and it took a bit of looking to find it. And the food was okay . . . the service was good. If you're not really picky about your comfort food  . . . or your health  .. .  I'd recommend it . . . not too heartily, but sure, try it, you might have a better experience than I did."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with a coworker.  The food is absolutely amazing!  The service was great and we got the food in no time!  I highly recommend the open face sandwich! Nom nom"}
{"text":"Keep hearing great stuff about this place.  So, today I am going.   I will see if I have to change by review after I eat there,  Made it there and it was worth it.  Great fish and chips and peppersauce burger for the son.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a really great place for lunch. Generous portions and reasonable prices. Fast seating and service even when there is a line out the door. They are so good the line is always out the door.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my sissy one day. I ordered the Beef Cheesesteak. I can not believe this does not come with mayonnaise!! Good thing I ordered extra mayonnaise. lol. I thought it tasted a bit dry so it wasn't the best. They also toast it for you as well. My sister ordered the tomato soup and she enjoyed it.   They have a pretty big menu so I would definitely come back to try some other items."}
{"text":"Great menu variety and great service. There hasn't been a meal that I haven't enjoyed yet."}
{"text":"First time impression was awesome! Sat down as soon as I walked in, the server came right over and asked me what I'd like to drink and if I know what i want already! They must have a lot of regulars that come her for a quick good meal and go. Great business. I ordered the special, whatever it was it was fantastic. Fries were yummy and crunchy. Everything is great here, I look forward to being a regular. It's super close to my company's office!"}
{"text":"We really like this place. It is close to our work and as many others have already said it is tucked away in an industrial area. This is a very down home type of place with an Arizona twist. I have enjoyed the burgers and the sandwiches and I always order potato salad as a side because it is so yummy! It is definitely an eclectic mix of people due to the location, but it is very comfortable no matter who you are. The service is good and the quality of the food is really great. The pretzel buns are really soft and tasty which added to the overall delicious factor for their burgers. We really like it and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Nifty cool place. Off the beaten track and worth the find. Not sure why this isn't under breakfast but they have a heck of a good breakfast. People are friendly and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Never been here before, pass it everyday as I literally work the next street over. Did a carryout order. Got chicken fried steak and eggs with hashbrowns. My hubs got eggs with corn beef hash and hashbrowns and toast. Both enjoyed our meals... Wish I had known about this hidden gem... I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Visited Pepper Sauce on a whim, it's near my place of employment and looked pretty good on Yelp. Me and the person I visited with had a hard time selecting one item, so we decided to order a meal and share with each other. We both had the Peppersauce Burger and the Beef Cheesesteak sandwich. The Burger was delicious, big and juicy, we opted for pastrami and Swiss. The Cheesesteak was really good too, had a little kick, most places are hit or miss, either too dry or the veggies aren't cooked enough, but this one was done just right. We will return to try more menu items in the future."}
{"text":"Very good food. Stopped for breakfast on a rainy morning on a friends reccomendation. Great food and very friendly service. I would recommend to anyone and can't wait till I am in the area again. Best hash in town."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week. Had the turkey cobb salad and was not disappointed. The salad was big enough for a family of 4 and was loaded with turkey, avocado, bacon, and all the other good stuff. I would definitely order again.  My husband had the meatloaf and wasn't thrilled with it. I know that there is something wrong when he only eats 1/2 his meal.  He's been there a few times before and has enjoyed the burgers so he's not giving up on this little place. Chalk it up to a bad day which is forgivable."}
{"text":"More like 2.5-stars. I've been a few times for lunch- the food is generally alright and service is always good, but I wouldn't pick this place if I had other options."}
