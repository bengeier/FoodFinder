{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. All are fantastic. I love their cinnamon rolls for breakfast, salads and hamburger for lunch, and lobster pasta and others for dinner. The lobster and shrimp pasta as well as other cheesy pastas are really rich and yummy. Their coffee is good also. It does not taste diner-y at all.  Ambiance: more like old school bar/diner/restaurant feel with semi-private booths. The divider for the booths can come down, so that 2 side by side booths can be open for a larger crowd.  Love all their food."}
{"text":"Great place in a nice area. Thank God the omelete wasnt runny and they have heart healthy options but some great hearty breakfast too. My spouse had the meatloaf sliders and they were great!"}
{"text":"Solid, hearty American fare in downtown Hudson - only ever been there for dinner, but I've heard good things about their breakfast.  Everyone should be able find something they like on the menu.  Excellent service, full bar, cloth napkins with a kid's menu.  Always a mix of people dressed up and dressed casual."}
{"text":"Hudson's is the place we like to go when we're in the mood for comfort food, a nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonable prices.  They have great burgers, nightly specials, a good variety of food,and excellent service.  They are a Hudson institution as far as we are concerned, and the location couldn't be better.  Right on Main St, with plenty of on-street parallel parking and a good size lot in back."}
{"text":"Stopped in this trip for the old luncheon stand by -- a soup and a salad. These guys do an excellent chopped salad and flavorful minestrone soup.  It was simple, but good, not the easiest thing to come by in rather fancy Hudson."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Hudson!  We loved the food, the service, and the atmosphere.  We took our time and had a lot of fun enjoying the eats.  I highly recommend this restaurant, and that's saying something because I rarely give out 5 star ratings.  Great job!"}
{"text":"I love Hudson's. Had dinner there last night with friends.  The changed their menu - added some new dishes and kept some old favorites.  I had the Tuscan flatbread which was done to perfection! My better half had the French Chicken sandwich with a side if rice. It looked amazing and he said it tasted great! I  always enjoy going there - pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I had the lobster & shrimp pasta. It was great. The Cobb salad was very good, too. Service was slow, but the place was packed and there was a waiting line. Prices were pretty good."}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed by a meal here yet.  Each time I've gone I've tried something different and each time I've been impressed.  The ambiance is nice - low lighting, mostly (if not all) booths, gorgeous bar and great staff. Only once I got sub-par service there, but I would not count that one experience against the place, especially considering all of the other servers I've had have been stellar.   The first time I visited, I ordered a penne with shrimp and cream sauce.  There were more shrimp in the dish than I could count and it was delicious.  I ended up taking about half of this (huge) dinner home and my server put it in a take-home container, labeled it with the contents and date and wrapped it in cellophane.  Made a huge impression on me.  They have great weekly specials and I cannot say enough good about the food here.  Very inexpensive, too.  I've never waited in line here, either.  Definitely worth a trip if you've never tried!"}
{"text":"Burgers were 5 stars all the way - amazing!  I would happily go to Hudson's for a burger.  We were a large party and half of us got burgers - we were all very happy.    All other entrees - 0-1 stars -The other half got other meals/specials and they were all unhappy. Their food was cold and tasteless.  They all said they would never go there again.   Bottom line - go for the burgers and pass on most of the other entrees."}
{"text":"Well they get one star because I can't give zero. Been here a couple of times and every time it has been terrible. The food has never been good it's hard to explain, I just don't like restaurants where I feel that I can do better at home and that's how I feel with Hudson's. The food is mediocre at best and that is being nice."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place has so many positive reviews.  The food is forgettable.  I ordered Eggs Benedict for brunch.  The eggs were way overcooked and the sauce was pretty gross.  The burgers we ordered were not good either.  My son spit his bite out.  The service was pretty slow and unfriendly despite it not being particularly busy.  Also, the Bloody Mary was watered down and bland.  There are much better options in Hudson."}
{"text":"Had the Grilled Salmon with a baked potato and asparagus. The meal was excellent, but only 4 stars because I had to ask the server for bread and when she brought it, it was dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Great meal!!!! My husband had the Prime Rib and said the flavor was perfect. Served with it was a vegetable medley and it was really good too. I ordered the Filet and it was probably one of the better Filets I've had in a long time. Alongside it was a saut√©ed spinach that was sooooo good! If you know my posts I always order two margaritas and rate them. This one was a 7 out of 10. Not too bad since I rate most of them a 5. I always order the house salad with oil and vinegar and give it a 5 because they bring me a bowl of lettuce with tomatoes and onions and oil and cider vinegar. Tonight the house salad was served with eggs and bacon and oil and Balsamic vinegar which I give an 8!  I really loved the food overall."}
{"text":"I've been to Hudson's more times than I can count, mostly for lunch on weekdays.  I'd give 5 stars to their chopped salad, but 2 stars to anything else on the regular menu (burgers excluded.  I'm not much a burger person, but my husband and coworkers are all huge fans of the burgers here).  I've tried a few of their other sandwiches, and the flat breads, but didn't really like any of it.  That chopped salad is good enough to keep me coming back though.  I'd also recommend checking out their seasonal menu, which usually seems more interesting and creative than the standard menu.  I remember they had some kind of pasta with hot peppers and calamari on the menu several years ago, and it was amazing.  I hope they bring that back!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Hudson's. They have a large menu with a variety of food. The only downside is that I have had long wait times for food, which puts a damper on plans when you are trying to eat fast. One of my favorite things is the steak salad (which you probably can't classify as anything healthy since it has steak and French fries on it, but it's delicious) and their flat breads are pretty amazing too."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and great owners! Our family has been dining here almost every week when we're in town (all summer). We use the catering for special events like birthdays and our 5th of July party!   The owners routinely walk the restaurant and ensure that the diners are all satisfied with their meals.   Saturday night is prime rib night! I have rearranged my running schedule a few times to enjoy a nice prime rib. :)"}
{"text":"Hudson's is a great place for family's and is super nice. A little pricey but very yummy. I had the strawberry salad and it was very pretty and tasted great! Little cut up strawberry's in the outer part of bowl and salad was perfect. Dressing was amazing as well. I very much liked this restaurant.  I Recommend completely!! :)"}
{"text":"5 stars now the warning:  5:30 to 7pm you could wait a longtime on weekends.  If its summer just put your name down and enjoy downtown Hudson."}
{"text":"New menu is lacking and way overpriced. Burger was not cooked to order then over cooked on take two.  Rest of the meal was underwhelming. Waitress was rude."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for breakfast. It reminds me of a cozy diner but with a classier atmosphere. The prices are always good, the food tastes fresh and flavorful, and the service is great.   I keep meaning to go here and try something off the breakfast menu, but the morning menu is just too enticing.   I would also like to try one of their cocktails. The chalkboard toward the entrance always has a list of seasonal and affordable drinks I'd like to try."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about these reviews...  This place may have had an off night with us. Orders did not come out at the same time, food was cold and the redo wasn't much better.  It just wasn't  a good experience.  The drinks are iced up and watered down, too bad I wanted to like it.  One and done for us, not worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite restaurants for burgers. The buns are always fresh and the burgers are juicy and big. I love the vegetable combo with it, but my kids love their fries and hash browns. This is one of more reasonable priced restaurants in Hudson and a great value! I love the decor and the booths allow private conversations. We have always had great service when we have been here. If you are in the area, give it a try."}
{"text":"This was a nice restaurant. I met my aunt for lunch and the service was friendly, the food was good. The inside was spacious, clean. I wouldn't drive the distance because I HAVE to have food from here, but I would come back next time I was in the area. It's definitely worth coming back to. I enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"Was recommended to us ...very good burgers. Better bloody Mary's! Impressed with children's popcorn shrimp... Was real shrimp battered and fried. Liked the hot wing pirogi.... Not too fond of the loaded chips. They had too much balsamic and blue cheese and nothing really stuck to the unsalted chip. Was really kind of disappointing. Lots of good choices. Felt that they were trying to do really trendy American food and it was just a touch over the top. But really enjoyed the tenderness of their burgers,steak and those popcorn shrimp"}
{"text":"I must say I miss it's sister store in Fairlawn but I will admit I enjoy the road trip to this location . The food here is always great and we've never had anything here we didn't like. The wait staff is always on their job and do it very nicely I might add as well. Thank you for giving us a place for a road trip to, we love Hudsons!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Here's a great local restaurant with a good concise menu, excellent service and every dish tastes delish.  I've visited several times since moving here and every visit I've been pleased with the food selection and quality.  The service has been tops too...but in full disclosure I must admit that each visited luck would have it that we've only traded off between two servers, yet I know more exist.  We've had tilapia and French chicken sandwiches, the burger, and the children routinely have their chicken fingers.  All were prepared as ordered and very tasty.  I love their fresh cut fries and Coke products.  Their chip appetizer is packed with flavor, but the actual chips have been weak.  They're small and easily break apart.  Each experience here has been a happy one, and it's become a restaurant concept I miss when I travel."}
{"text":"Just ate there on Sat. The waitress forgot to turn in the order. We waited 35 min. before telling someone. Not a good experience! Food was ok."}
{"text":"Hudson's restaurant has a diverse menu of American cuisine that is reasonably priced. I went there with a group of 8, and we were awkwardly seated at a four top table next to a booth - it was like we were sitting apart. Although the place was not busy, our service was slow and in general not attentive even when she did make her way to the table. I started with the mushroom flatbread- I wouldn't get it again. Others in my group got the fig flatbread and the margarita flatbread. Out of all three I recommend the fig. The buffalo pirogies are outstanding! The tuna melt was very good as well. Overall very good food with subpar service in a boring cramped settings for groups."}
{"text":"We came here on accident on our way back from Niagara to Columbus. It was an amazingly happy mistake. We tried all the side salads, all were delicious. The cocktails were reasonably priced and well-made. The pastas, Osso Buco, and Prime rib dip were all delicious. The service is excellent, and everything was well priced. Unfortunately, it's quite a bit out of the way for us to go there regularly, but we would detour there from Cleveland whenever we go up again."}
{"text":"Great meal and service.  I'm really surprised by the negative comments.  The interior and decor are really nice, I was worried at first it was too nice for our casual dress but we were fine.  I ordered the grilled meatloaf (I know, not exactly fancy but it's my guilty pleasure since I'm the only one in my house who eats it so it's a treat).  This is not your mom's meatloaf, it was more like meatloaf medallions and it was delicious!  It was topped with onion strings and I chose smashed potatoes for my side.  The potatoes we made from red potatoes and amazing.  My husband had the filet medallions and they were cooked exactly how he ordered them.  I would definitely come back if we're ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Bad experience at Hudson's Restaurant     I noticed that the menu had changed considerably, to smaller selection but, this is good considering the items now listed are the best, not the case here !   They had taken off the best burger, the \"Teddy Burger\" , a bad choice since it was very good and on menu for decades from fuftie's ! They now offer a build your own burger with fresh cut frie's, sounds good right? Wrong for $11.00 I got a approximately 5 oz burger with no flaver because no seasoning and the fries somewhat tasted like fresh cut but we're a substitute from precooked freezer bag ! That's it for me, done ! Tom Dean Hudson, Hio"}
{"text":"Good brunch. Had eggs Benedict. Most of all I love the throwback to the 80's decor. It's well maintained and feels new and the fake skylight cheers like wooden fixtures make it nice. Will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"We got take-out here the other night and were pleasantly surprised! We both went with pastas and side salads, and now we're thinking we may quit Zeppe's as our go-to pasta place - it was that good! Lots of variety on the menu, and food was warm and ready when they said it would be."}
{"text":"I seriously fail to understand any bad reviews for Hudson's. While I do think breakfast is their standout offering (try the southern benedict, it changed my life), their lunch/dinner menu is also great. My husband and I like to try new places, and in Northeast Ohio, have yet to find a better breakfast spot than Hudson's. Everything tastes homemade - I've never had sausage gravy from a restaurant that doesn't taste like it was made from power, except here. The home fries are clearly real, fresh cut potatoes. Pancakes huge and fluffy. Having said all of this, while everything is good, I think you'd be most likely impressed if you choose from a house specialty (as opposed to a run of the mill eggs, toast, breakfast meat type dish).   We don't go for lunch or dinner as much, but when we do, I have enjoyed salads, sandwiches, and burgers all quite a bit, too.   There's rarely much of a wait and while it's not the cheapest place you can get breakfast, it really is one of the best."}
{"text":"good food on trivia night!    Came up to Hudson's to visit my family and it is right in the middle of town.  The restaurant had a homey feel especially with trivia going on.  I had the foodie burger with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and cheese.  I had fries with it.  The burger and fries were awesome, plenty of flavor in both.  For dessert I had their apple tart, it was amazing.  The apples had great flavor and the pastry had a balanced crust on it (not mushy, not hard).  With ice cream it was a dynamite dessert. Great experience overall, did I mention trivia!"}
{"text":"I really have nothing bad to say about this restaurant. Great food, great service, a little pricier than I imagined, but nothing crazy. Good sandwiches and appetizers, I would recommend for a early dinner. I recently ordered the cobb salad and that was a huge portion, (I had to take most of it home) and it was delicious. Great ambiance too, very quiet and intimate. It reminds me of a old-school little Italian restaurant (even though it's not Italian food), that's the feel it has to it. I haven't been for breakfast yet, but have heard good things on that part on the menu. It's a great place to take your mom out to dinner, or to stop by for lunch on the weekends when you're out and about. I wouldn't recommend taking the young kids out to eat here, especially during the busy hours. Not many kid options and since it's so quiet, it may not be well-suited for the young ones."}
{"text":"Local Hudson residents please disregard post.  Anyone else.... There is a reason why they closed the Fairlawn location! We stopped for breakfast because we always heard it was good, ironically from locals. Well I appreciate their loyalty to local businesses but what a disappointment.  Good luck guys, maybe instead of sleeping in you might want to see who's manning the grill.   Rebecca was great and we appreciated her service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. This restaurant had delicious food. However their pricing is very high. For a side of bacon (2 pieces) they charge $4.00 that's two dollars per piece of bacon. That is absurd. Most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Two other visits: 1) breakfast was great! Omelette, hash browns, and really good grain wheat toast. 2) dinner was not so great. BBQ-glazed salmon and smashed potatoes. The salmon was undercooked so I didn't finish it and I wasn't digging the BBQ sauce. Potatoes were good. As always, service was friendly! 4 stars for the two-visit average."}
{"text":"Uninspired, limited food options at an unreasonable price make Hudson's a miss. Somehow this place stays open. Do yourself a favor and go next door to kepners. Their burgers are jaw-droppingly good!"}
{"text":"I'm not from the area, so after we discovered a bajillion year wait at the other place we wanted to go to, my friends and I stumbled upon Hudson's. I'm glad we did. We were seated immediately. Service was good. I had the delicious lobster & shrimp flat bread. Ohhh it was good.  Only complaint: we must have caught the restaurant at a bad time. They were out of two of the beers on their drink list. Our waitress said they were in the process of changing up their drink lists, so they really just won't be serving those beers anymore. They were also out of salmon. I guess they have some two for something Tuesday deal which includes salmon. They  had 30 something salmon orders that evening and were also out of salmon.  Not that big of a deal to me because my food was delicious. I also can't decide if they should have been able to anticipate that kind of salmon rush or not."}
{"text":"Do you want classic American fare, served in a comfy down-home setting where the waiters offer to be your friend, give you crayons to draw on the white paper tablecloth, and don't even give you a hard time when you and your boyfriend draw stick figures with questionable appendages? Well, then, Hudson's is clearly the place for you.  I've only been once, but my boyfriend and his family go often, and they swear by the \"Loaded Chips\" with balsamic sauce, bacon bits, and lots of other goodies. They're actual potato chips, not fries, and the balsamic sauce is amazing.   Their steak burgers all looked amazing, but I was still in a post-Christmas-dinner food coma, and opted for the Asian Chicken Salad. Very tasty, though I wish that I'd asked for the chicken grilled instead of fried.   My boyfriend had the cheeseburger pierogis (\"They're exactly what I thought they'd be!\" he proclaimed) and the white bean and pork chili.  The food was good. The crayon drawings multiplied with every sip of my Christmas Ale. Life was good."}
{"text":"Breakfast gem. They seemed to have carried over breakfast recipes from the old Mary & Ted's diner which served Hudson for decades. Outstanding omlette. Pancakes. Coffee should be better quality. Longtime servers are consistently attentive and friendly. I don't tend to go here for dinners; other choices in Hudson win out. Go for breakfast! BTW, they don't nickle and dime you like Yours Truly for sides at lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Never a bad meal, and I like the linen tablecloths and the ambiance too.  One of my fav spots for a lunch or dinner with friends, because I know the food won't disappoint and the sound level is quiet so you can actually hear what your table mates are saying!  The firecracker shrimp appetizer is yummy and very spicy - I usually ask them to go light on the fiery sauce so it's not overwhelming.  Their flatbread apps are great too.  My favorite menu item has to be the Teddy Burger - their take on the Big Mac but so much better.  And here's a place to skip the fries - you don't want to miss the homemade chips!  They are fabulous - the appetizer chips comes with green onions, feta and a balsamic vinegar drizzle that is to die for!  I've had friends order the chip appetizer to go and then they bring it to parties - always goes in like seconds.  Be sure not to miss this restaurant when in Hudson."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to restaurant. The breakfast is very good with just the right amount of menu items. Dinner is great too!! The menu may not be very big but this tells me one thing, the food is fresh!! The bigger the menu the more your food comes from the freezer! The burgers are very good, their French onion soup is one of the best around!!! The French fries are fresh cut and crispy. The flat breads are delicious. You should give it a try!! The service is great too!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great family friendly restaurant that is a cut above most. The service is excellent. The food tastes good and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We just tried Hudson's restaurant for the first time. I ordered the chicken marsala which was awful, I order chicken marsala wherever its available and this was the first time I ever had one that I couldn't eat. There honestly isn't one good thing I can say about the dish. My daughter ordered the lemon chicken pasta which she also didnt eat so we decided to swap meals and we both agreed that neither dish was edible. When the waitress came over with the bill she asked if the food was ok which we kindly replied that we didnt like it, each meal only had two bites taken out of it. So she went to talk to the manager about what they could do about it and somehow they decided that instead of taking the 2 meals that were basically untouched off the bill they gave us 50% off each entree.... I was dumbfounded. We will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"I have been going to Hudson's for a long time. Probably since about the time it opened. Early on in my visits Hudson's was a welcome surprise to the area. The food was amazing and the service was as well. The place has or had (not sure if it still does or not) a working relationship with the cities local community theater the Hudson Players. The last few visits I had have been less than stellar.  Tonight I went there with a friend. We were seated immediately and given the somewhat small menu. This is the first time I ever had this experience but the server seemed a bit out of place. Hudson's is an up scale facility. I felt this server this time made me feel like he just walked in off the street from some Ghetto somewhere. His speech pattern and posture did not fit that of what would be expected in a high end facility. Scary really. What was he doing there? He was knowledgeable and well trained but I kinda got the one of your boys you watch the game with vibe from him..  The food came out oddly quick. Too quick to be fresh.  My friend got what I described as a seafood flat bread pizza and I the Pasta Bolognese.  His pizza had an amazingly strong odor. Almost too strong. I didn't order it and I got a sick feeling in my stomach when I smelled it. He really couldn't eat it. \"It's is not that it tasted bad just not good, \" He explained.   My pasta was also just okay. It did not seem fresh. I mean there is no humanly way it could have been made fresh in the amount of time it took to arrive at the table. I don't think so at least.   I do not remember the quality of service being this bad...I mean maybe its because there are two of them now.. but for almost 15 bucks my pasta was not worth it. My friend could make it better. He is a good cook.   I wish I could say more good about Hudson's, but I just can't."}
{"text":"I frequently go here when I have a group of friends. They have an amazing breakfast menu with many healthy options. For lunch the chopped salad is always refreshing as well as the French chicken sandwich. It is easy to get seated because it is larger than some other establishments in Hudson. The staff is friendly. It is one of my favorites in Hudson!"}
{"text":"We've been going to the restaurant for 6 years and year after year it gets better and better. The staff is very accommodating, the New menu is very good, the BBQ Salmon and French Onion soup is awesome!  I've used there catering service for several events most recently a Christmas party and everyone raved about the appetizers.  I shouldn't be commenting on desserts because I don't need them but there desserts are amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place and come here whenever I am in the area. We had a big group so I was able taste a lot!  Generous portion of lightly fried yummy cheese curds. Great buffalo cauliflower appetizer. I really like the lemon chicken pasta, my husband had the Walleye and ate every bite. I asked for a doggiebag so we could try their cheesecake..we had key lime,( I think it changes monthly) and the  table shared the brownie sundae. Both Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people. Make sure to sit at the bar and socialize. Good selection of craft beers. Prices are very reasonable. Got to get the house chips. Two brothers trained at Culinary Institute of America. Very creative menu. Our regular haunt."}
{"text":"This is one of those rare places where a party with many different tastes and needs can be happily accommodated. Vegetarian SIL, bloody steak loving BIL, picky grandchild, old-fashioned granny.....all can find something on the menu and none of it is bad. Cheap house wine. Great chopped salad. Service was exceptional, and I know large parties can be a challenge. Plus, we walked in at 6 pm on a Saturday night with no reservations and were quickly seated. Was it the best dining ever? No. But it was way better than average, we were all happy when we left, and it was not expensive."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the food has been ok, to good. Their seasonal dishes (especially fall) have been great. The staff and service is usually good, as are the drinks.  Nothing to write home about, but definitely a place to be considered if you prefer not going to chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Four of us came in late for drinks after a game, and sat at the bar. Once the bartender came out we were served and visited with her. She didn't rush us, and the drinks were good. Has a nice-looking restaurant, too."}
