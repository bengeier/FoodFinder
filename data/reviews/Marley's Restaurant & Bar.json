{"text":"This place makes homecooked food.  It's so good.  From soup and sandwich lunch combos to meatloaf and mashed potatoes for dinner, you can't go wrong.  They have a nice patio for outside dining and an awesome staff.  Great food!  Great place!"}
{"text":"Horrible service 3 times in a row. Food is plain. If you want to drink and have bar food, this is one of those places. After sitting for 25-30 minutes for service, with only 3 other tables in the restaurant,  I won't ever recommend this place. The amount of snowbirds in this area also kills any kind of pleasurable meal. Disappointment."}
{"text":"I had stayed away for about a year for dinner and had lunch twice during the last year.  We had gone in with a group of 12, the first dinner trip we made to Marley's and altho we first first to arrive, another large group arriving after us got seated first...I asked if if the restaurant had took reservations, was told no, and when I asked about the other group, I was told they had reservations (huh??).  Anyway, we given 7 glasses of water for 12 people and of the rest of us who ordered salads, only one appeared. Took 45 min. for our order to be taken.  After all the others got served, turned out they forgot to put in orders for 2 of us.  So we went back last week to see if there was an improvement.  Waited ten minutes to be seated after owner told us it would 3 seconds til they finished clearing off the tables.  Waited a loooong time get a server..requested water without lemon..we all got lemon anyway except for one of us who got no water at all.  Four of the seven of us got bread plates..the rest of us needed to wait for a plate.  Loooong wait for our salads..last time, which was for lunch, I was told I couldn't have my salad first since it was a side dish to the entree..told owner that is unlike any place I had ever gone to before...he got an atitude and asked me if I ever ran a restaurant....at least this time, we the salads before the entree.  One order was not what was ordered..altho we were told we could get the early bird special since we were seated before 6, the server said we hadn't ordered before 6 (maybe cuz we waited about 20 min for him to take our order..we complained about that and it was taken care of.  Bottom line....this place needs to be organized better..nobody knows what they're doing...the food was ok...service dismal..too many other choices."}
{"text":"We tried Marley's last weekend for breakfast.  It is a three meal restaurant & they do have a bar...it doesn't look like your typical breakfast place & most people might miss it.  Our server was extremely friendly & attentive, and the food was very good.  Husband & picky-eater daughter were both happy with their generously portioned breakfast burritos, son had a combo breakfast & I had French toast.  Basic breakfast fare.  Worth a try vs the chain breakfast places, as you won't have the long weekend wait times.  I prefer to support local businesses when I can."}
{"text":"Today my wife and I were running errands and getting hungry.  As we drove down Bell Road we found Marley's and thought that we would give it a try.  I thought that it was associated with Dan Marley, not so.  It is a local family owned place.  As we walked in it was obvious that we were the only customers in the place which made it a little scary for us but the staff said that we were between the lunch and the happy hour people, it was just after 2:00 in the afternoon on a Wednesday..  Our waiter, Dillon showed us to a booth and supplied us with menus and silverware.  He brought us our drinks and was very patient as we perused the menu.  Finally we both decided to have the Guacamole Burger, mine medium and hers well done. The thing about bacon on a burger is that it must be done right, crispy without being burned and the bacon was perfect.  Great burger made with fresh ground meat, never frozen according to Dillon. The restaurant was clean from the floor to the booth.  Staff was professional and friendly and the food was great. We would not hesitate going back there and recommending this to our friends and family."}
{"text":"Here on business and wanted to find a good place to go for dinner went to yelp and found Marleys it was a little hard to find but was worth it. Great service, nice atmosphere. My husband had a burger was good, best thing was the flatbread chicken we would go agian."}
{"text":"Marley's is everything a person is looking for in a casual dining experience. The staff is amazingly upbeat and nice. They are always quick to greet you with a smile. The ambiance is very inviting, there are comfortable booths with high backs for privacy. There are a few flat screens around the perimeter of the restaurant to watch the game on. The is also a small separate bar area that seats about 10 people.  The menu is the staple of this dining experience! although the menu is somewhat condensed, the diversity is absolutely superb. there is a hint of southern soul food, all american dishes, some italian influence and by far some of the best desserts i have ever had.  The staff, though small, is like a family. every time my girlfriend and I go in everyone from the servers to the owners approach us to welcome us and converse with us. And the prices!!!! every time we go in we  have an appetizer, entrees a couple of drinks and sometimes dessert and we have never spent over $40 there.   As much as i would love to suggest a dish to try, I cant pin point just one. i can honestly tell you i have not had a single dish here that was even just ok. everything is on point.  This place is a perfect example of a well executed dining establishment and if you are looking for a place to dine in Surprise, you would be doing a disservice to yourself by not trying this place"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time today. Staff was terrific!  We were greeted warmly at the door and our waitress, Judy was friendly, helpful and very professional.  The food was excellent. I had the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries and my friend had the vegetable beef soup.  Everything was delicious.  I am so happy to know about the restaurant - we will be coming back often!!!!"}
{"text":"Marley's is fairly new and locally owned so my husband and I were looking forward to dining here. I wish I had read the filtered, negative reviews on this site before trying this restaurant for lunch. It would have saved us $23 and we could have had a decent meal somewhere else.  We stopped in for lunch around 12:30 on a Wednesday. We were seated immediately and found the hostess to be polite as was our server. The menu has a nice mix of hot and cold items, mostly salads, soups and sandwiches. The restaurant does have nice ambiance--it's warm colors and comfortable seating are very inviting. If only Marley's paid as much attention to their food as they did to the decor.  I ordered the Croissant Club sandwich with fries and my husband ordered the grilled fish sandwich with kettle chips. After ten minutes, the waiter reappeared to inform me that they were out of croissants and asked what kind of bread did I want. A more experienced server would have offered to either show me the menu again, or at least offer what other bread choices were available. I had to inquire what my options were, and they were limited to sourdough, rye or wheat. For a restaurant with so many sandwich items, I would have expected more choices but perhaps they were out of those as well.    The food arrived in a timely fashion, but was disappointing. The club sandwich includes smoked turkey, avocado, tomato, lettuce and bacon. The avocado was not just oxidized but rotten. The bacon, which I expected to be cooked fresh, was stone cold, precooked and poorly rendered. The turkey, while fresh, tasted like generic grocery store deli meat infused with fake smoke flavor. The bread was lightly toasted and also tasted like it came from the grocery store. The french fries were warm, but had no seasoning at all.   With his first bite of the grilled fish sandwich, my husband bit down on a bone. He pointed it out to the waiter who said to just keep eating it because there probably wouldn't be many more bones in it. Pity about the fish because it was the only thing on either of our plates with any seasoning. The coleslaw was bland and a tiny portion. The sandwich came with kettle fries, many of which were crisp, some of which were soggy and none of which had seasoning.  The menu stated that our dishes would come with a cookie. They didn't, but that was okay because they probably would have just come from the grocery store anyway. We really wanted to like this place, but the food just isn't worth it.  Sorry, Marley."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Marley's by friends who migrated to AZ from CA.  Imagine that.  With every visit to AZ I head to Marley's.  The menu selection, quality of food, friendly staff and reasonable prices keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Average food. Hubby had hamburger but didn't feel it was anything he has had before. I ordered the flatbread, but could not eat it...very bland & oily. The dough was not cooked through & had to send it back. It still wasn't edible when I got it back. They did take it off my check, so I give them kudos for that.  The service was excellent, there weren't many people there. After hearing such positive reviews, I was disappointed & won't be going back because the food just wasn't good enough."}
{"text":"Went Friday night for the first time.  Right off when you walked in a strong fish smell.  I have always heard that fresh fish doesn't have a smell.   Four of us ordered four different things and we would rate them from mediocre to bad.  We all decided we might go back for lunch but not diner.  In my opinion, their menu is all over the place.  Home cooking like liver and Italian dishes and steaks chops and shrimp.  Do less and do it better!"}
{"text":"Service from our waiter was excellent... Food was pretty good The Hostess that worked on March 19, 2012 was the rudest I have run into in a very long time. My co-worker and I had our lunch, she had ordered a Bloody Mary (which she had drank half of it) and we were enjoying ourselves chatting after our lunch. We had been there about an hour and the Hostess came to our table and ask us to leave!!! Yes she ask us to leave because she had people waiting! She didn't come and ask us or try to explain to us that we would really be helping her if we would leave, she just ask us to leave flat and dry, we were appalled. Wow, in 60+ years that has never happen to either one of us. That Hostess needs to go to polishing school and learn some manners before Marley's looses all their costumers! Thank you for listening, P. Munn"}
{"text":"I was immediately greeted when I walked in and seated within 3 mins if that. The menu was not difficult to navigate. I got the jambalaya and tried the sloppy joe sliders. I also had a margharita to drink. The sliders were amazing. They make the buns fresh in house. The peach cornbread that came with the meal was ok. My server Donna was great and attentive. The jambalaya came with more cornbread. I would have preferred some french bread or garlic bread.  The shrimp was slightly overdone, but was very tasty.overall. I would order it again. But the crowd was about 50+ so I felt a little out of place. Overall a good experience with great service."}
{"text":"Nice lunch menu selections, and very reasonably priced.  I ordered a sandwich/soup combo and it was more than enough food for lunch!  Service was good, and the atmosphere was nice.  Can't wait to try it for dinner!"}
{"text":"Last time we ate here I rated it a 5... This time was average. I ordered 2 8oz steaks, a 6oz steak and a Philly cheesesteak. The food was average at best and the service wasn't much better. The server did a great job but I probably will not go back.  While we were sitting outside a different waiter had the nerve to pull the heater away to his table without asking us first, very rude..."}
{"text":"Will never return, simply not worth it.  Had a \"1/2 lb\" burger the other night and it was more like a half oz.  Server was way over his head too.  All in all the place is not a good restaurant.  Won't waste another trip hoping for better."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a very welcome surprise to Surprise.  The food, service, drinks and prices are all great.  The only down side to this location is that it is just too small to hold all the customers they will see in the coming months.  Gotta try the Peach cornbread.."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and ordered the 4oz cheese burger and fries. The waitress was prompt & courteous. My burger was raw inside and sent it back. the waitress was very apologetic and with in 5 min. came back with another burger. Took another bite and it was raw as well. She seemed very sincere and apologetic and said she talked to the owner but no one came out to explain how i got two raw hamburgers in a row. I can understand making a mistake but 2 in a row seems to me they did that on purpose. They are lucky i did not eat that raw hamburger and get sick and sue them. they can kill some one like that. i will never go back and will tell every one in surprise not to go to that place. i am posting this on Facebook as well and anywhere else i can."}
{"text":"Brian was excellent and made wonderful recommendations on what to try. The food was delicious and the split pea soup was the best I have ever had. Yes, even better than Anderson's. try it, you'll live it. And ask for Brian.\""}
{"text":"First time visit for dinner. Four people in our party. Nice place. Limited menu. Food very fairly priced. Three of us had the salmon which was moist and tasty. One had a hamburger, which he said was very good, and had similar praise for the sweet potato fries as well.  Other friends we saw at another table, said the liver and onions were delicious...and they are hard people to please.  Service was excellent. More iced tea delivered even before a glass was empty. Owners help deliver the food, and all servers seemed to be doing a very effective job.   The other thing I liked is that the server told us what the special of the evening was, instead of assuming that we saw it on the board, on our way in. Many restaurant servers \"assume\" that you know what the specials are, and don't bother telling you.  The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars was because we all asked that the garlic butter sauce be left off of the salmon. Two of the 3 dishes came with the sauce on the salmon. The server was very apologetic and offered to take them back, but the 2 people kept it.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I went here for lunch yesterday. We were not impressed. The lunch menu was severely limited! If you don't want a burger, sandwich, or salad you're out of luck because that's all they have for lunch. The only highlight was our server Brian who was polite, energetic, and a real pleasure to be served by. So we decided to tough it out, that is, until our appetizer arrived. We order the loaded nachos and it hardly had any cheese on them at all! They're called nachos after all and even in their simplest form they're at least \"chips covered in cheese\". And besides a small two ounce side of sour cream there was nothing to dip them in, and the guacamole on top was from a can no doubt; just an all around disappointment. We may come back for dinner just to see if they have more than three types of selections for food on that menu. We were going to stick around for a beer but there were three of us and someone was already at the bar we didn't want to be cramped. Gives the term 'mini-bar' a whole new meaning."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here for lunch & dinner. Great food! Lunch they have specials that are very affordable! Service was great, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Marley's.  What a find.  Friendly, friendly staff.  Rick took good care of us.  Sports bar setting.  But the food....wow.  Some of the best I've had.  My wife loved the steak salad."}
{"text":"GENERIC BUT.. Locally owned and operated. I want them to be sucessful but all I could think of was GENERIC, VANILLA, Seen it before, below average quality. Being locally owned I want it to be successful...just not sure the owners really understand the whole idea.  Sparse, and average at best. Marleys needs to find a niche quickly. Also 8 pm closing hour during the week......way too early for his type of business. 10 pm would be fine."}
{"text":"Marley's is a nice change from all the chain restaurants in Surprise. Dinner menu was diverse without having too many items to choose from. Definitely something for everyone. Service was very good from both the host and hostess as well as our waiter. Prices are very reasonable!! Dinner for 2, including wine, was under $30. Peach cornbread was delicious!! My Cobb Salad was very good... All fresh ingredients and a generous portion. Hubby had Chicken Parm. That too was delicious but the sauce was a little less 'traditional' in that it contained mushrooms, celery, green bell peppers, sausage and other seasonings. Like I said, it was delicious, just not the usual marinara some might expect.    Looking forward to going back to try lunch and/or Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"First time visit.  Decided to stop in for lunch one day.  I thought the food was good, had a few nice differences to make their meals unique.  Service was good, overall a good place.  Pricing (for lunch) was reasonable.  I think they may have a different menu for dinner?    One funny thing that really impressed me was their menus.  Nicely produced, full color menus in nice holders.  Some places use photo-copies, these guys took it a few steps further.    The food was good enough that I grabbed a few menus and put them in the break rooms at work."}
{"text":"We stopped by Marley's for lunch before the Rangers Spring Training Game. Marley's was very clean, had good food, very reasonably priced and the wait staff was very courteous. I got the lunch special. You could pick 2 items from Soup, Salad, Half Sandwich. I got the Turkey Avocado sandwich and Cesar Salad. The Cesar Salad was very good and the Sandwich did the trick. Beer was cold, game was on TV. The lunch crowd seems to be a much older crowd, but what did we care."}
{"text":"We ate there for lunch a few weeks back.  Had the soup and salad lunch special.  After my wife ate the soup, a large bowl not a cup, she was full.  She took the salad home.  My clam chowder was great and salad was really good.  Salad dressing was very good.  Going back for dinner with 3 other couples in a few days.  I don't usually write reviews but this place is very good for the price."}
{"text":"Hand patted burgers with in house ground beef, hand breaded tenders. They also have kiltlifter on tap and a decent happy hour. They are right next to Sun city, so it a little laid back, but service is friendly and fast! The blue cheese crubles are so tastey on the burgers but the blue cheese dressing isn't home made, so skip it unless u like the.more sour blue.cheese. the ranch is normal. We will definately be back. Oh, they also had colering books and crayons for the kids!"}
{"text":"Mario is very personable. Nice ambiance. Other customers are friendly.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I recently went here with 7 coworkers for lunch. We were all pleasantly surprised with the variety of sandwiches and salads. The cookie is a nice bonus too! I had the turkey avocado sandwich with the Greek salad for $7. The side salad was a good size and I also liked how the dressing was automatically in a separate cup. Fresh ingredients delivered fast with attentive service. Love that it's not a chain. We will all be back and will probably make it a regular destination."}
{"text":"Won't be returning. Came for breakfast because the website said they had waffles. Our server said they discontinued waffles because they were too popular and couldn't keep up with the demand. ... Wow. Additionally, I wonder what happened in that parking lot for them to need to put 'Don't park here unless you are a Marley's customer' signs on every spot?  It doesn't appear to be a terribly busy lot."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for drinks, they close super early (830). Wha they began closing at 815 piling up tvs and electronics in the booth next to us. I won't be back."}
{"text":"First time decided to check a new place. Ordered \" Friday special\" -Cod fish with cole claw and fried pickles. Pickles were under cooked with tooooo much flour . Cod nor seasoning at ALL!!!! Like eating raw soft potato. Cole slaw did not have ANY seasoning ..... I can make all that meal MUCH better! Will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing but old people, who didn't appreciate my 2 and 5 year old. The service was great but the food was not impressive. Their garlic mash potatoes tasted fresh... out of a box. There's nothing I like more with my dinner than having a 60 year old telling my 2 year old to quiet down. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I met a friend for a quick drink here, but decided not to order one once I saw the bar.  I think the restaurant actually looks really nice and the drink prices are actually good, but the bar is so small.  Does not compel me to stay and hang out with friends.  I did order the flat bread, but I didn't love it.  The service was great though."}
{"text":"Just a quick update,  Marley's is one of our favorite restaurant in the West Valley. On our last visit, I had their BBQ ribs with their new fresh cut fries. First of all, I am not a fan of their new fries. Wished they never changed! Fries were to greasy, and salty. Please go back to the old fries. Their ribs was a huge portion, I thought is was pretty good. I have had better, seen them more tender. Flavor was good, but it seemed to be more from the sauce. Glad I tried them, they have much better option on the menu."}
{"text":"We have been twice and the food is good and the menu offers a lot of selections.  The service was good the first time and a bit slow the second.  Parking is a bit limited and the sign is hard to see from the road unless you know where it is.  Owners formerly ran Mojos in Sun City."}
{"text":"I have been craving a good burger for a few weeks now and living in Surprise, there are slim pickins. However, after a quick yelp search the beau found Marleys just 10 minutes away from us who boasted the best burgers in Surprise. So of course, I had to go.  It was pretty quiet on a Thursday night. We were seated right away. Our waiter was nice but service was a tad slow. We both ordered burgers. My beau had the jalapeno burger while I went for the bbq bacon cheeseburger.   Their beer menu is pretty small. Mostly domestics, nothing too appealing. However, the rest of their food menu is pretty extensive. Definitely worth a look next time.  The burgers came out in about 15 minutes and were very good. Definitely the best I've had in Surprise. It was obvious that the patties were hand crafted and not frozen at all. I highly suggest swapping out fries for onion rings. They were perfectly crisp.  Btw - Marley's closes pretty early for a bar and restaurant. They close at 8pm so I'd def get my butt in there early if you're craving a good burger!"}
{"text":"Marley's is just mediocre all around.  Mediocre food, mediocre service, mediocre decor, whatever you can think of, it's mediocre.  There's nothing about it that differentiate it from the various American restaurants that are littered all over Bell Ave.  Eating the same type of food, prepared the exact same way, and with the exact same taste.  If you want to eat at Marley's you might as well just head to Red Robins and get unlimited french fries."}
{"text":"The service was really good, it was very clean but the food was not appetizing at all. I would not recommend or return there again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for dinner after hearing good reviews.  They place had a good atmosphere, there were a lot of order people there but it still had a young feel for it.  Our waitress was amazing!  We had the fried pickles which were so good, they fried the whole pickle!  I had they guacamole burger, which was nothing too special, it had a lot of avocado and not that much flavor otherwise.  The meat on the burger was amazing though.  My boyfriend got the Jalapeno Burger, it was interesting not a spicy as you might think, but really good."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today with three other couples. Service was prompt, server was pleasant, food was very good. Left there feeling full and happy. Will go again."}
{"text":"We got there at 5:30pm and were seated right away.  Notice there was a crowd as we were leaving.  So we got there just at the right time.  Our waitress was excellent, friendly with a very nice smile and sparkly eyes.  We ordered their Friday Fish Fry, it was awesome, deep fried cod, 3 large pcs. For each of us, choice of potato.  My hubby had a baked potato, and I had the sweet potato fries,  yummy, and cold slaw.  Also an extra perk, our waitress brought us a fresh baked peach cornbread mini loaf with whipped butter, this was complimentary. Very nice addition to the Surprise eating fair!  By the way food was very good and we got it very quickly.  We were out by 6:15 pm."}
{"text":"Not going to to be a returning customer....at least for breakfast. The buffet of Fathers Day was cold and extremely limited. The only saving grace was that the staff was friendly and attentive. I liked the taste of the food, but it would have benn much better if it was warm."}
{"text":"Recently opened at this location--about 13 weeks ago. Very nice staff. Some interesting Hamburgers-- like the San Francisco. Good food. Not too big portions; prices are reasonable. Nice surroundings; has an outside patio. They have these \" Sauces\" that are additional ( $1.99) for the French Fries or Sweet potato fries--which is OK, but 22 bucks for a side of sauce is a bit silly. Fairly small portion of fries, but enough for most folks"}
{"text":"I have taken my wife there for Sunday brunch and other family members another Sunday, also for brunch. I enjoyed the omelette  bar very much, the chef is a friendly man always smiling even when it's busy. As usual, Sean was tremendous, as well as John, the other server. When John was busy, Sean helps out and vice versa even if it's not their table. Really great people there. I also enjoyed the thin slices of sausage patties with biscuit and gravy. The price is excellent for $9.99."}
{"text":"Been here many times, as others have stated one of the few non-chains in Surprise.    Can really only point out a couple things from all the times we have been here.  The servers are outstanding for the most part.  We did have a male waiter once who seemed to be new and was not so great but the ladies who have been there since they opened up are all fantastic.  The problem here in my opinion is the food.  It has really started to slide and is at the point now where I really prefer to go on weekends for breakfast because I cannot find  anything on the dinner menu that I want.   The burgers are ok, but I do not always want that as a dinner entree.   When you get into the steaks and such, it is just plain not good.   Breakfast continues to be pretty good.  Overall if the food quality doesn't improve I doubt they will make it long, which is too bad because it is a nice atmosphere, and a lot of good people there."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Marley's in a long time...since the era of the peach cornbread...which disappointingly no longer exists because, as our waiter put it, \"they need to save the peaches for the peach cobbler\".  I didn't realize canned peaches were nearly extinct!  People, heed my call...covet your canned peaches now before it is too late!!  My next warning:  Don't order anything fried because it is all the same frozen stuff you can get in the supermarket for much less and without having to tip someone.  I almost ordered the Chicken Fried Steak until I found out it was a frozen piece of breaded ground beef.  Maybe Marley's Restaurant & Bar should be renamed to Marley's Frozen Foods.  What did Marley's do well?  They were extremely \"successful in avoiding flavor\", as one of my co-diners remarked.  She had the baby back ribs with corn and mushroom orzo, my other co-diner had the 5 oz. sirloin with orzo and a baked potato that was the size of an egg, and I had the meatloaf with clam chowder and orzo.  Oh boy where to begin?  Yep I just started.  The orzo used to be risotto on the old menu...but I guess risotto takes more skill and finesse to do successfully and orzo can be simply made in advance and reheated in the microwave, which is what our orzo tasted like.  Sans any flavor of any sort.  I actually had to...*wipes a tear* add salt to it, which is usually a no-no in my book.  The 5 oz. steak that was requested to be cooked to medium was cut into the shape of a laughing cow cheese wedge.  Except I wasn't laughing.  And it wasn't cheese.  Neither was it cooked to medium; it was more in the raw mooing stage.  It was also more like 4 oz.  Maybe they had to reserve the other 1 oz. for their peach cobbler.  My clam chowder would have made a Bostonian embarrassed.  It was made with good ole corn starch and had little to no cream.  No smoky goodness from bacon either.  How could you forsake BACON??  My meatloaf was a brick.  Literally.  It was packed densely and devoid of any moisture and had a brown gravy on it.  If I hadn't put a little ketchup on it, I don't think I would've tasted a thing from it.  I'm embarrassed that I suggested the restaurant to my co-diners and have had night sweats about my decision ever since.  Marley's used to be palatable and the peach cornbread was really what made me want to try it again...but now that it's gone for good, I guess I'll have to save my dining experience for one of the better restaurants in Surprise.  Feel free to try it out if you'd like.  As for me, unless Marley's makes some serious changes and puts some more thought and care into what they're serving, I'm taking my can of peaches and going home!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a burger at a restaurant that wasn't blaring obnoxious music.  Left 3 Brothers and Red Robin as couldn't stand the BLARING music.  Guacamole burger was good and so was service.  Not sure worth $10.39 plus tip.  The relative quiet - even with three televisions and music (radio?) in background  is worth something."}
{"text":"Great staff and food! Reasonable prices, good lunch combos. We have never been disappointed at Lunch. Nice outside seating and great drink specials. Good selection and prices on early bird dinners. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Beyond irritated with the owner Lisa. She does NOT pay her employees. It's been two months that my husband has not gotten paid by her and I'm beyond pissed off now! She won't even answer his calls anymore, just refuses.  Don't support this!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place to have lunch on a Sat. Afternoon without a wait. I found this place on yelp. The reviews sounded promising. I'm glad I gave it a try! We entered around 1pm. The place wasn't super busy and we were immediately greeted & seated. Service was great. Food didn't take long. Food was great. Good sized portion. LOVE the fries!!! Potatoe skins included :) refill timing was on point. Spent just $26 for 2 including about an 18% tip! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow..New to the area and have found my home away from home!   Menu has  something for everyone. Service is attentive and staff is friendly.   Must have:  the homemade peach cornbread!   Everything is fresh and cooked to perfection. Favorite dishes so far are the pork tenderlion and the chicken parmesan."}
{"text":"Not consistent with food. First couple of times was good. This last time my liver and onions was raw. Waiter took it back and that was the last we saw of him for twenty minutes. Next thing I know I have a piece of shoe leather in front of me. Service sucks."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and always enjoyed the experience.  For some unknown reason, haven't been there in awhil, so we decided to go for dinner last night.  Place was packed (mostly with snowbirds - shorts and tee-shirts in 50 degree weather).  Food was great as always (one eggplant dinner and one liver & onions dinner) but the service was POOR.  Waiter took our order and we never saw him (or anyone else) again until he brought the check.  Large party a few tables away so maybe that was the reason.  Won't stop use from going back.  Much better here then the chain places."}
