{"text":"Toppings are good but the bagel is tasteless.  Our everything bagels had a layer of uncooked dough. I was very excited to try, too bad I hope they try to improve."}
{"text":"Wayyyy too expensive. 19 dollars a dozen is a joke! They taste okay but not worth the price. Id rather drive to Toronto and get a great bagel. Gas would be cheaper anyway. Too bad as i was ecxcited to finally have a bagel place in Oakville. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Cute little store. I had the smoked salmon bagel and it was delicious. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is due to the price. However the price doesn't seem to stop me from coming back. Recommend this place if your craving a bagel."}
{"text":"After noticing that this place had opened while passing by we had to stop in. I hadn't eaten lunch yet so I decided on the sesame bagel double toasted with fig jam and cheddar cheese. Oh my goodness it was amazing! I love that their bagels are not gigantic like some places but they have a wonderful texture and great flavour. They were sold out of quite a few and advise they had already baked more and it sold out again! No doubt as many people came in while we were there. I can't wait to come back and try some more bagels. The staff is very friendly, the decor is really nice as well! Great new place in Oakville!"}
{"text":"Finally tried them today and must say I was disappointed.  First of all $5.10 for a plain bagel and garlic cream cheese.  What??  My bagel was a bit charred on the outside, but it didn't ruin the taste.  Typical Montreal bagels and lots of flavours, and I'd love to take a dozen home to the family but not at these prices - I'd rather go to the bagel house in port credit.  May be back if I'm really craving a bagel, but if I wanted to spend a relatively absurd amount of money I'd go to harper's or b. good and and least leave full."}
{"text":"Great bagel place recently opened. All bagels are made fresh here and they have different types of meat available to cater to everyone's needs. People working here are very pleasant to talk to and they will slow the conversation down to inform you about their different bagels! Prices are OK and ideally a good takeout place as seating is limited.  Bagels do taste really fresh as the brand states \"All natural ingredients.\""}
{"text":"Tried OKO for te first time today! Best bagels I've tried. Fresh, great bagel options, gorgeous decor/store and very friendly staff. I will be visiting often for sure."}
