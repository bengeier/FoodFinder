{"text":"This place is definitely not \"gourmet\" but really good \"home\" cooking like Mom makes.  Portions are huge.  I usually go for the Lamb which is excellent and this time I had their special of Pork Medallians which was equally as good.  Also had caprese salad and bruschetta. Husband had veal parm with pasta.    Decor is old school Italian. Servers were friendly. Place was empty, but we were pretty early in the evening. Made it quiet, quick, and relaxing."}

{"text":"The atmosphere at Big Papa's is a mix kitschy with Italian paraphernalia strewn all over the walls and ceiling. There's a small sidewalk-side area with a few tables, which is a nice place to enjoy a coffee on a sunny sunday morning. The coffee is great by the way!  On weekends they offer a brunch menu and if you're a weirdo like me and don't like eggs (I know, who doesn't like eggs right?) there's not much to choose from on the brunch menu. There were 6 or 7 options to choose from and only the pancakes didn't come with eggs. However, the pancakes were good and when requested I got plenty of syrup. For about $8 I got 6 small pancakes, a dollop of whipped cream and a couple blueberries. Not bad, but nothing amazing about it.  I'm giving Big Papa's brunch menu a 3 out 5 simply from my own point of view (not a lot of no-egg options). If you're an egg lover, please review the other side of the coin!"}
{"text":"Big Papa Trattoria is like East Side Mario's (Italian paraphernalia covering the walls), the big difference is the food at Big Papa is really good.    It's a little west, so down-towners might consider it a bit of a trip to get to, but it's right at Royal York subway, so really, it's not that hard.   My boyfriend and I had lunch here. I had the mushroom risotto which was probably some of the best I've ever had. Massive chunks of mushrooms, not too salty and not to bland, good consistency (not too runny or sticky). SO GOOD. My boyfriend had a veal parmigiana sandwich with a caesar salad which he said was also very good.   I'll definitely be going back for the risotto, but I also think I'll go check out their Nutella \"sangwich\" on Italian toast with espresso for 4.95 (maybe they'll let me substitute a decaf tea?)."}
{"text":"Had a mini Yelp meet-up for the West side today and I was a little disappointed with my favourite little Italian place. Everything was good; not bad, not great but good. Perhaps my taste-buds have grown to identify mediocre food or maybe I remember my meals here better than they actually were.   In any case I had the Caprese salad and the California Risotto. Both good and as usual, the Risotto serving was huge and needed to be put in a to go box."}
{"text":"I have to agree with others who say this place is just \"A-OK\", nothing more. During Sunday morning brunch the place was nearly empty yet service was on the slow and inattentive side. Food took far too long to come out - this is brunch, people, not slow cooker stew.  The menu was chuckle-inducing bordering with names like Pete \"Crazy Legs\" Pollo Pizza, Va Fon... Pizza and numerous SANGwiches (lifted directly from the menu, I'm not poking fun) including a breakfast sangwich of egg, ham and cheese or egg, mushroom and cheese for only $5.95.  I opted for the Eggs Benedict'O' - two poached eggs, wilted spinach and hollandaise atop slices of crusty Italian bread, roasted potatoes and fruit. The presentation was lovely (see pics) and the fruit quality was good but there wasn't enough hollandaise for my liking and the inclusion of two extra slices of Italian bread was confusing...I don't know what they were for; it certainly wasn't to mop up the extra liquid as it was at a premium on my plate.   They have daily dinner specials and on Mondays it's AYCE pasta - I was amused by the tagline next to it: \"You can't handle the pasta!\" - Big Papa. I'm almost tempted to go back to take him up on his offer..."}
