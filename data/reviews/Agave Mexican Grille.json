{"text":"Agave Mexican Grille is a VERY welcome addition to the abysmal dining 'scene' in the East Suburbs. 

I sincerely had no idea Mexican food could taste this good. 

The food at Agave is ALL made fresh -- no canned SYSCO foodservice stuff, thank God -- and the flavor of this fresh food is flat-out amazing. Everything -- from the chips and salsa at the beginning of the meal -- to the entrees and desserts -- is just outstanding.

Tonight, I ordered the shrimp tacos....delicious, delicious, delicious. My boyfriend ordered the chicken chimichangas, which were topped with queso (cheese sauce -- the real kind, not that orange stuff). Of course, I had to try some of the boyfriend's food -- and it was excellent. 

The service is always good; we often get Alex as our server, and he's sharp and very attentive. If you drink, you'll be happy to know that Agave has a liquor license. 

The first time we went to Agave, we had a coupon from the Shopper or Coupon Clipper or something. The owner not only let us keep it to use again, he gave us another new one to use on subsequent visits -- and we have. Smart guy. 

And yes, Agave Mexican Grill is MUCH better than El Campesino -- I went to El Campesino a few times and could not figure out what the big deal was. I've been to Agave 3 times in the last month and keep coming back for more. 

Agave is located where the Original Hot Dog shop in Plum used to be, and while I'm an 'O fries' girl, Agave is a VERY welcome replacement. 

I'm wracking my brain trying to think of anything I don't like about Agave, and I can't come up with anything I don't like.  Oh wait...if I tell you people about how good this place is, I won't be able to get a seat. Damn."}

{"text":"Horrible experience.  Crappy Mexican food after a 2 hour wait!!  Never ever go here!  Don't believe any of the obviously fake positive reviews, this place sucks. When we confronted the manager she simply said sorry and shrugged. Their excuse was they had a lot of big groups but it was a Friday night at 6:30, what did they expect?  They comped our drinks, thats all. One of the worst experiences of my life."}
{"text":"Food was OK, but service was slow even though they weren't very busy. It's basically one big open room."}
{"text":"My husband and I were shopping for furniture over a holiday weekend.  After three furniture stores, we were starving and we didn't want to eat fast food.  Luckily, there was a Mexican restaurant on the same road as one of the furniture stores.  We thought, could be tragic, could be magic.  We took our chances.  

We both lived in Texas for 30 years and we love Tex Mex.  After living in New Hampshire for six years, where there are three Mexican restaurants in the entire state and none of them are good, we've been excited about the prospect of finding some decent Mexican food in Pittsburgh.  We'd been to a couple of the popular local chains and they were OK.  But they don't serve anything close to Tex Mex.  Agave Mexican Grille, however, exceeded our expectations.  

The decor is a little cheesy, the fake party supply store Mexican decorations are unnecessary.  Let the food be the star!  The menu featured the combination dinners we've been looking for, all served with rice and beans.  The owner was waiting tables that day and we got to talking.  He brought us a basket of warm chips and not a bowl of salsa but a bottle with a bowl.  The salsa was straight ahead, not too spicy,ice cold and tasty.  The owner also brought us a dish of their salsa verde, which was spicy and smokey, and theit white queso, which was delicious.  Those were on the house.

I had the Speedy Gonzales, otherwise known as the combination dinner #2, which had a  beef taco, a cheese enchiladas, rice and beans. For me, the cheese enchilada is a bellweather dish.  If a restaurant can get a cheese enchilada right, they're onto something. It was delicious. My husband had a three enchilada plate and his was also very good.  The ranchero sause was quite good.  

We were so please to find a REAL Tex Mex place.  The owner gave us a coupon for $5 off our next meal, so we'll most certainly be back."}
{"text":"I have only ordered one thing here, but I have ordered it more than once.  Their Chori Pollo is pretty close to being an ideal flavor combination, in my mind.

Agave just opened recently, a welcome replacement to the Original Hot Dog Shop (hot dogs... ugh.  Thank the lawd that's gone.)  It has added something new and definitely needed on the 286 corridor: A Mexican-style restaurant.

Their food quality is about par for the course for a tex-mex sort of place.  It is not haute cuisine, but it is definitely not fast food either.  It is the sort of middle-of-the-road, satisfactory experience we associate with a lot of Mexican restaurants as norte americanos.  

And as for the Chori Pollo, well, it's basically ambrosia.  I have trouble processing just how much I love it.  

The price is ever-so-slightly high, though I think I order one of the more expensive dishes.  Also, the quality of the refried beans and rice is a little bit low, but it's still delicious, and let's be honest, that stuff's just filler anyway.

If you are in Plum, or in the general Golden Mile Highway area, and you or someone in your group doesn't like Indian food, go here.  If you all like Indian food, go to Zaiaka.  The point is, I think Agave might be my second choice in the area."}
