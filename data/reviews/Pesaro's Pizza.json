{"text":"Just ordered from here. Had my order delivered and got to try an original calzone with mushrooms, pizza with garlic butter sauce (no marinara) with broccoli, and a pizza with their marinara and mushrooms. The pizza crust was fluffy and a very satisfying consistency - if that's the sort of pizza you like. It's not my favorite and I'm sure that has something to do with lackluster review. Regardless, cheese was plentiful and everything looked as though someone paid some attention to it.   I was unimpressed by their sauce. Keep in mind I had a cup of it on the side of the calzone that allowed me to get a pretty clear impression. It's boring and thin. I don't think it has any redeeming qualities. The mushroom pizza was cheesy and it was piping hot. Nothing spectacular though. The broccoli pizza with the garlic butter sauce was the most disappointing. The garlic butter sauce was easily as boring as the marinara. How is that possible!? Not sure I tasted butter, but the box was pretty greasy so it might have been in there. Definitely not any garlic in there though. Boring. Boring. Boring.   I'm new to Pittsburgh and I'm still learning my way around the pizza joints. I recommend Caliente if you like thicker, fluffier crusts. I still have a lot of places to try and I hope I won't be coming back around to Pesaro's Pizza any time soon, or never. I think never would be okay."}
{"text":"Great pizza for the late night snack! I ordered a large deluxe pizza and loved it. Toppings were fresh and juicy. Definitely try for other menus next time!"}
{"text":"really inconsistent. just forced down a third of a buffalo chicken salad that was ridiculously hot. everything is different each time we order it. after this experience i'm not so sure i want to order again."}
{"text":"This place is great for late night pizza. The employees are friendly, it's open til 1:45am, and you can get a 'takeout special' Large 1 topping Pizza for exactly $10.69. It's big enough to sober you up before bed and still have tasty leftovers the next day. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Normally I have no issue Pesaro's but after my last order I'm done with them. I ordered the family feast when the driver came I paid him $23.53 right after the driver left I noticed I did not get the breadsticks or 2lt of tea & my hoagie was wrong. I called was giving the run around about that's not what I ordered and I would have to pay $3.50 more if I wanted those missing items. After complaining about how often I order from them I was told the $3.50 would be waved even thou I had paid it with my original delivered order. When the 2nd drive came with the corrected hoagie & missing items I was told once again I had to pay $3.50 I was told it was put into the system wrong. I don't see how that is my problem when I paid the 1st time, if I didn't have hungry boys I would had returned my whole order.  I paid the difference and vowed to never go back there they didn't care they were loosing a long time customer. The only thing they cared about was $3.50 and would not believe I had paid the 1 driver who I suspect kept the difference and also his mouth shut when asked what I paid him. Mistakes happen and would over look this is the I wasn't treated so rudely."}
{"text":"First time ordering from the Lawrenceville store. Yuck. This place better re-evaluate their ingredients and taste standards because it was just blah. The Sicilian pizza crust was terrible and there was hardly any sauce on the pizza. There are so many better places in the area, especially Bloomfield.  Try Frank's also in Millvale. Amazing."}
{"text":"I've never felt the need to write a review after years of using Yelp. But I feel I need to warn you. Unfortunately, this is the worst pizza place I've been to in Pittsburgh, and I've been to most. It also competes for the worst food I've had in Pittsburgh. Let me start off by telling you about the experience.   First, online ordering is completely useless. I wasted about 20 minutes trying to enter my order into both Yelp and GrubHub and neither worked properly. I would try to clip the \"free breadsticks when spending $25\" coupon after adding $25 worth of food to my cart and instead of working it would just delete my pizza from my cart and say \"Oops! Looks like you haven't spent $25 yet!\" So I tried GrubHub. We decided to get the 'Family Feast' - Pizza, breadsticks, a sub, a drink for $25ish.  When choosing the 1 topping pizza we noticed there's no option to make it only half pepperoni. Fine. We'll just make the whole thing pepperoni. But when you go to add 1 topping to your 1 topping pizza it charges you $1.75 for an 'extra topping'! I guess the one topping they give you for free is just the cheese. Fine. I'll pay $1.75 for pepperoni. Now to choose a sub - my wife wanted buffalo chicken. As you might expect, you can customize it a bit, but there is one section in particular where you can add extra toppings, like gyro meat or crab meat. We thought about it, then decided not to add crab meat...but it doesn't let you. It's a required field! You have to pay extra to add some extra topping or you can't add it. When I went back to check the pizza section I noticed it's the same thing - you are forced to pay extra for a topping - even the one that's included! And there is no way to just choose cheese pizza with no extra topping.   So I called instead. That experience was great! I decided to add $5 cheese fries to our Family Feast. Food was done pretty quick and they gave us everything we ordered. Unfortunately. The most damning thing about Pesaro's is the taste of the food.   The breadsticks are bland, the sub might have been edible but did they didn't put any buffalo sauce on the buffalo sub. The ranch is just packets. The pizza tastes like what I remember next-day Chuck E Cheese pizza tasting like. And that wasn't even the worst. Literally, what are those cheese fries? Why are they charging $5 for those? The fries are uncooked. The cheese is just a giant glob of some bland cheese that cements the raw fries to the foil. It was impossible to eat and if there is one thing I'm thankful for it's that. I threw them right away. To be fair, it wasn't all bad - the highlight of our meal was the 2 liter of Pepsi.   It's often true that you can spend a small amount of money to get a lot of trash (Dominos), or spend more money to get a little gold (Spak). Pesaro's is like spending a lot of money on a little bit of trash. How does this place exist on Butler street?"}
{"text":"My mom visits me for pizza. Perhaps there are other reasons such as my charming personality or birthright, but the fact that Pesaro's can be delivered to my apartment entices her a bit more.    Prices aren't the cheapest, but are pretty comparable for the area.  A fan of the fact that you can order   Today we went the online ordering route which always estimates a longer delivery time, but I was pleased at the time it took to be delivered.  I also appreciated that tonight's delivery man wasn't smoking which I have had happen to me before (first I don't want my food to smell/taste like smoke second if you are having trouble juggling a reciept/pen and pizza you shouldn't add something else into the equation).  As we normally do we went the make your own pizza today opting for a white pizza with hot peppers and meat.  The number of toppings is impressive and welcomed considering we pay for them individually.  The pizza was so hot you would have thought they cooked it on the way down Butler Street.  Only complaint if it was entirely too greasy - like leaked through the box + paper towels and left a puddle on my table.    Stand by and safe bet if you need a pizza from the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I am not sure how to rate Pesaro's.  It is not the best pizza in the neighborhood, Graziano's is, so I should give Pesaro's 1 star because if you want pizza, Graziano's is the place.  Unfortunately, Graziano's does not deliver and I am not always motivated to get off my butt, so I give Pesaro's 5 stars because they are the best delivered pizza in the 'hood.  They also have a larger menu selection than Graziano's, which is good.  The pizza is solid, just not as good as Graziano's."}
{"text":"Fries is so undercooked it's practically white. \"Garlic\" bread is basically butter on bread with garlic powder - it's so salty and greasy it the stuff of heart attacks. The lettuce on the wedgie is anything but fresh, its color is a mixture of light green and shades of brown. This food is not edible."}
{"text":"Pizza is good...don't order any of the appetizers. ..they were terrible...so was the fish sandwich...if you're going to order anything...make it pizza and nothing else"}
{"text":"Very prompt service. The food is delicious. The two gentlemen at the counter were very friendly.  The portions are enormous for the price! We were extremely satisfied!!"}
{"text":"Got a meatball sub and fries for take out. Not the best sub I've ever had, but not the worst. The fries were awful and soggy even though I picked it up right as it was finished being made. I'm not sure about their pizza, but I'm not too confident it's better than the places I currently order from."}
{"text":"Very greasy, lots of cheese, lots of toppings.  If you're the kind of person who takes a paper towel and tries to remove the grease from pizza; this place is not for you.  If you're the kind of person who loves great tasting pizza, you will love this place.  Perfectly cooked, and delivered fast."}
{"text":"It seems that others have had problems with deliveries, however I have only picked up orders here before. Pizzas have been quickly made and ready by the time I arrived. The quality and pizza prices are right-down-the-road average in my opinion. I would recommend trying it sometime."}
{"text":"The mozzarella cheese sticks were not cooked and taste horrible. The honey bar b que bites were burnt, soft textured and no flavor. The buffalo chicken was completely gross and the chicken was cold as ice. The pizza lacked flavor, cheese was cheap with opened canned tomato sauce. WILL NEVER EAT FROM THEM AGAIN. A COMPLETE DISASTER AND WASTE OF MONEY"}
{"text":"Holy crap, y'all. This pizza has got dat cheese drip. We ate it on the sidewalk and I ain't even mad about it."}
{"text":"The steak hoagies are amazing, generous portion of seasoned steak and the perfect amount of cheese. I get it well done and it's delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered an Italian Stallion Deluxe hoagie and a small original calzone for delivery at lunchtime on a Friday. The food arrived within a half hour and was Exceptional! The portions we're big so we're going to have delicious leftovers!! Way to go Pesaros, TY for a great lunch!!!"}
{"text":"We got wings here. They were decent, i didn't have a problem with them at all. But the service was horrible.  We ordered ahead of time and showed up at the time we were told (about 20 min). We were told it would be five more minutes because the wings needed to be \"sauced\". We then saw the wings being put into the oven. They had not even been started. It was not busy in there. There were FOUR people \"working\", but three of them were standing around talking while one did everything.  We had also used a coupon, which we had told them over the phone as requested, but we were rung up without the coupon. When the coupon was mentioned, they very quickly deducted the amount without question, which made it seem like they knew very well about it, but were just trying to see if they could get it past us. I may be reading too much into that, it could have been an honest mistake, but that was my impression. Maybe I was just irritated after waiting for my whole order to be made after calling it in ahead of time when they clearly were not busy (and had plenty of people working that were not doing anything.   I would definitely not order from here without a coupon, the prices were a bit high for standard takeout wings."}
{"text":"Worst pizza place in Pittsburgh. And I've had pizza all over the city. By far the worst! Service was also terrible."}
{"text":"Yummy! Ordered a take out personal size pizza for lunch, and was not disappointed. I added 3 toppings (pepperoni, bacon and green peppers) so it was about $7 for a 7 inch pizza. Big props for how much toppings they loaded onto my pizza! It was piled high and there were no bare spots, which I appreciate. The crust was yummy, more of a pan style thicker crust. Not overly cheesy or saucy, pretty much perfect. I felt like it was a quality pizza for the price, and was fresh and quick. Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"I ate a slice here. It was fresh and cheesy and made well but was basic.  The store was clean and they had other food to choose from."}
{"text":"Ordered the pepperoni calzone and added mushrooms. It was delicious and ginormous. Think they made me a large one when I ordered a personal. I'll take the mistake!"}
{"text":"The calzone & stromboli were good. However, our appetizers were not! I ordered fried mushrooms & my husband got the onion rings. The onion rings were burnt. When I called to complain, I wast old that they don't have a deep fryer. They cook them in the oven & if they cook them less, they get soggy. So, I guess the serve burnt appetizers. My \"fried\" mushrooms were the worst I've ever had. They were soggy & flavorless. I called & was given a credit for the onion rings (I didn't realize that my mushrooms were not good either & wasn't about to call them again.) Stick with anything other than the appetizers. Why even sell \"fried\" items if you have no way to fry things?  We won't be ordering from this place again, even with the credit."}
{"text":"Finally found a pizza place I liked. Unfortunately, they ruined it for me as they have 0 customer service. I ordered a pizza,  when I opened it I discovered it had slid in the box,badly. It was smashed up and looked like lasagna. My neighbor who was eating with us called the store to complain. An employee/manager authorized a 25% discount for our next order. OK cool. We call to redeem the order. Hassle. Get passed off to another employee, are told they can't verify it as the named employee wasn't working and nothing they could do for us. So we said we would order elsewhere. Seriously who calls a pizza place with a fake discount? We were bored and had nothing better to do than scam 25% if I we were scamming we would have said Free you owe us free pizza. Pesaros if you want a better rating on yelp (which you should) you can hire me and I'll teach you and your employees customer service skills. Maybe I'll even give you a 25% discount on my rate ;). Get it together, then you can win our business back."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza shop in the Lawrenceville area. Don't really have any complaints about this place, and their pizza is very good. If you're looking for good, quick, and reasonably priced delivery around Lawrenceville I would recommend Pesaro's"}
{"text":"Since Graziano's was out of the crust we had wanted and we found that frustrating, we opted to order from Pesaro's.... what a good find!   The pizza was scrumptious!  I cannot give them 5 as I love Graziano's (the one lady at work here hooked me on their fabulous sicilian crust), But I can give them a good solid 4 and A+++++++++++++++++++ for delivery and being easy to order from too on top of having yummo food!"}
{"text":"This spot is located right in the heart of Lower Lawrenceville. Pretty basic pizza place and their prices are reasonable. One of the better pizza places I've had when it comes to casual, delivery/take-out pizza. They have a large menu, so you can definitely find something you like. Hoagies, salads, wedges, wraps, and lots of options for sides."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from here for at least five years. The most recent deliveries have taken an excessive amount of time. Tonight we placed the order at 10:25pm. The driver called us at 11:03 saying he was on the 62nd street bridge and asking where we lived in Shaler. The only problem is we live in Lawrenceville... Off of Stanton. It's now 11:37 and still no order. We should have picked it up, I'd be in bed by now. The pizza better be hot, but I have a feeling it won't be."}
{"text":"I ordered Pesaro's last week and it was great. I know a lot of other people have had bad experiences, but I really loved it. We got a large pizza with black olives and extra cheese. It was cooked perfectly, delicious and it got here in a reasonable amount of time with no problems. I'll try it again soon and hope that my opinion doesn't change!!"}
{"text":"I get the Hawaiian usually- very tasty simple pizza! I have done delivery and pick up. Both experiences were there quick."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice and had two very different, but equally dissatisfying experiences. The first time the driver got lost on his way to my house which is literally on the corner of two fairly busy residential streets, but the food was alright enough and in the end it still wasn't late.  The second time, however, made it clear I'd never order again. I ordered the food and it was generally on time, but for some reason instead of marinara for my breadsticks I got ketchup? Which wouldn't have been a huge deal had they not been bone dry. The pizza wasn't terrible, but the sauce was utterly awful and NOT the same as the sauce on the pizza I'd ordered the first time. I'm not sure what changed but I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone that wants worthwhile food."}
{"text":"This place is always reasonable and one of my favorite places to order from. I cannot comment on most of their as competently as I can their hoagies. From Itailian to Steak to Chicken, they are always fresh and delicious! We have had their Cheesy fries also and they are very good.  I would also  like to comment that their delivery is timely and efficient. Most of all and one of the many reasons that we continue to patronize them is because of their customer service. I appreciate being a valued cusomer and not just someone who gives them money.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. I was advised about what to try. I went with a calzone. It was massive although I ordered the personal size. It was average in taste but was very filling."}
{"text":"On my way to the cemetary and wanted to pickup some grub along the way and went into this little pizza place. Been craving calzones ever since I watched parks & rec. Needless to say, get the dam calzone! I ordered the Italian in the medium size but i can probably live off this for two days if I wasn't so gluttonous. Pretty sure it's implied, but it is delicious. The crust/shell has a garlicy taste sprinkled with some parm cheese. It doesn't even need the filling to be honest.   Back to eating this beast"}
{"text":"We called around 1:45 am, and the guy picked up the phone to tell us, \"hang up, we are closed\""}
{"text":"IF YOU ORDERED FROM THIS STORE THROUGH GRUB HUB, PLEASE CALL AND COMPLAIN!!! 1-877-585-1085. GRUB HUB GAVE ME A CREDIT, AND SAID MORE PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE THE TIME TO CALL THEM, TOO. We have ordered from this terrible place more than once. Every time, I ask myself \"Why the hell did I do that again???\"  Don't order any of their fried apps: broccoli bites, mozzarella sticks, poppers, etc. I seriously think they dip them in some kind of leftover pizza dough and try to bake it. That's EXACTLY the taste and consistency. Mushy and tasteless, covered in tasteless doughy stuff. Gross! For some reason, my boyfriend decided to order from them tonight. We checked their grubhub menu, and ordered a personal calzone and mozzarella sticks. Added 3 toppings to the calzone (pepperoni, mushrooms, broccoli).  We received the order, gross cheese sticks, then I cut into the calzone. NO TOPPINGS!!! Literally just sauce and cheese.  I am not usually the one to complain. I know that pizza places have their moments. I can deal with bacon instead of pepperoni, onions instead of mushrooms, etc. I really don't mind.  I called Pesaro's. I just had to. I really felt like I had wasted $25. We always tip them $5, and they are literally 3 blocks away.  The man on the phone was so completely RUDE! He said since I had already paid (through grubhub), there was nothing they could do. I had paid, and I had only paid for a plain freaking calzone??????? I asked him why they didn't call me???? I could've paid the extra $3 - $5 cash! They didn't even ask! They didn't call Grub Hub, who also could've called me. He just said \"Too Bad\" and kept talking over me. I was FURIOUS!!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!!!!!!!!!!!  They just delivered the worst meal when we are freaking starving!!!  I called Grub Hub, as I felt they needed to know who they are advertising on their site. She said she was calling them and they gave us a $10 credit. Yay Grub Hub!!! Boo this garbage pizza place! Lawrenceville needs more respectable businesses, not these half-ass businesses moving in trying to take our money!!!"}
{"text":"Won't be ordering from here again. The delivery man was rude because they transposed my address. I, very nicely, assured the man that I gave the correct address and again he shoved the receipt in my face wanting an apology.  I know this looks like a scorned review - but the pizza actually earned 2 stars on it's own. WAY too greasy and just okay tasting. I was really hopeful I'd have a better experience since this place is in the neighborhood. Oh well, you live and learn."}
{"text":"When I'm of sound mind, I tend to disapprove of competitive eating for a number of reasons, but a certain co-worker who knows of my huge appetite kept challenging me to a contest involving pizza. After telling him \"No\" many, many times, I found myself tricked into it once someone decided that it would be a fun way to raise money for a disabled co-worker.   We each had 20 minutes to eat as many slices of Pesaro's pizza that we could. I managed to down 7. My big-mouthed colleague did 8.  Yes, the finish was controversial. My opponent chose smaller slices, than mine, and therefore I still contend that I consumed more pizza than he. I burned the roof of my mouth (no one counted for the pizza's heat) and almost choked on the thick, chewy cuts of dough, but it was done to serve a good end.  People pledged money based on how many pieces were devoured, and by the following work day, the two of us had raised over $500 for the individual in question, and with so much pizza left over, everyone was victorious.   I'm done with eating contests, though. Ooof! That was tough."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for pizza , always fresh and yummy?!!-\"  Not fond of the fried mushrooms and cheese sticks it seems like the grease isn't hot enough."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from me. I've been curious to try their pizza. Just got a large Sicilian. The dough tasted like soggy cardboard. Now I know. And knowing is half the battle. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went to a few places around a few surrounding neighborhoods and came across this  place out of the blue.  Wow... from pizzas to subs, or hoagies as Pittsburghers say, it is allllll good.   Not too much or too sweet of red sauce of this pizza and the crust is always tasty."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza, great crust, always arrives fresh and hot Only pizza I eat in Lawrenceville"}
{"text":"I live about a mile from this place so its close when I want something delivered.  It's a safe bet that this will be the last time that I order from them.  I get the Family Fest - large one topping pizza, breadsticks, hoagie and two liter of soda.  With tax it's a little over $25.00 and with the tip I am spending $29.00 for something that's borderline disgusting.  I was craving a fish sandwich and ordered it with the rest of the offerings.  What I got was a cut up piece of fish on a slightly toasted bun with rotten lettuce, slimy tomatoes and three small containers of tartar sauce.    It's always been hit or miss with this place so consistency is an issue.  I wish I could post photos of this pathetic excuse of a fish sandwich that they sent me, I'd be ashamed to even wrap it in aluminum foil let alone send it to a customer.  I'd call and ask to speak to someone in charge but I doubt that it would change anything.  They are located in the heart of Lawrenceville so people settle for \"what's available\" but honestly, that's no way to run a pizza shop.  As it stands they are in the same ranks as Supreme Pizza which isn't saying a lot."}
{"text":"When it's Sunday morning at 1030 am and you want pizza badly...call these guys! Called at 1038 am for delivery to Bloomfield, was told 45 minutes  (average) and food arrived in under 30. Fresh, hot and good. Sicilian with extra cheese and a side of fried mushrooms were just what the junk food doctor ordered!"}
{"text":"Cheese sticks were chewy and barely hot. Italian Calzone was ok but way too much sauce made it soggy. Food did arrive quicker than they estimated. It was barely just ok food though."}
{"text":"First try last night, very good service. They delivered the pizza right at midnight! Great way to start the new year. Fast delivery even for a busy bsy night. I got an extra large pizza, it was pretty good. Price was okay. Very good dough snd cheese. Check it out"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the cheese calzone.  I get the personal one and it's huge. More than enough for one person."}
{"text":"$12.84 is an amazing price for the EXTRA large one topping pizza made with real cheese, fresh toppings, perfectly seasoned sauce, and dough that's done right, pick up/walk in special. Plentiful and full of toppings. Real cheese that's doesn't make ordering extra cheese necessary. (Ahhhh yeah, mmmmmmm, but we do, because we love their xtra cheese pizza w the thick fresh cheese layer, oh. my. yum. ) Fresh toppings.   I am going to be honest- Personally, Pesaro's Pizza is tied w Caliente's as my favorite local places to get pizza.  There are many similarities. Quality. Both use fresh, quality cheese and toppings. Both serve dough that's handled properly before it's even cooked and it can be tasted in the product when eaten.    However there are some huge differences. To start, price. Pisaro's is about 12 and some change for the xl. About ten less than my other favorite place. Pesaro's pizza size is also noticeably much, much bigger. We can order one xl and feed the entire family w a few slices leftover. Our other favorite place requires us to buy at least two of their xl size pizzas to equal one of Pesaro's.  Pesaro's Pizza pick up xl one topping pizza special is amazing. $12.84 is a fantastic deal!"}
