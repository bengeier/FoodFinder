{"text":"I've been to this place many times as I work nearby but that is not the reason why I go there. Guess what, the food is great even though it is expensive. The staff are super nice and they made sure that they get you seated right away. The location is very convenient as it is located in the heart of Yorkville. I've been to different Chinese restaurant but nothing compares to Dynasty. I will definitely keep coming back to this place. Folks check this out and you will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"TLDR: Was told to hurry up, server expected us to do his job and wasn't willing to tell us which items weren't coming.  Arrived 45min before they were done for dim sum, was greeted with a \"okay sit but please hurry up\". Huh?  Sat down, server brought the menu without saying a thing.   A different server came and gave tea, nothing wrong here.  A third waiter came to take our order, didn't say a thing again, and gestured for us to give him the papers/menu on the table. At this point it felt like I was an undercover staff of their restaurant! Bonus point for role-play!  Half an hour later, a fourth waiter came, circled something on our order sheet, said \"this is out\" and left instantly. What? What was out? Say something?! Please?  We had to look at the paper ourselves to figure out what was wrong.  None of the items had been prepared yet, and I was angry at this point and suggested to my companion to just leave. This is when they come apologizing to say that there are lots of other options, while informing us yet another item is out for the day (oh the irony).  I know they want to leave, but this is almost an hour before they stopped serving dim sum in the afternoon (lots of other customers when we left, not even an issue of going home). Please, if you don't want to work here, don't. I'm sure there are lots of other opportunies where you may learn a thing or two about waiting.  Never going back again."}
{"text":"The quality of the dishes matches the type of service that is offered, pretentious, crap at it's best. There was a 20$ egg white fried rice that really captured my interest, part of me said to myself ' what are you stooopid? 20 bucks for fried rice' and the other part of me that said' this fried rice must be loaded with goodness perhaps some sea scallops, giant prawns or even some deep fried cured pork belly' well kids it wasn't. It was a over salted plain egg white fried rice. To all those who gave this place 4 stars and above I am jealous and wish that I had shared the same experience as you. Then again if some of you that rated this joint 4 stars and above might be the same ppl who think General Tao is a staple to Sichuan cuisine."}
{"text":"Food quality maintained well over the years.  The carpet feels like they need some cleaning though... maybe time for some interior renovations?  Parking is not free on the weekend anymore."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure about Dynasty's dinner menu but i would definetly say that Dynasty sure serves up the Best Dim Sum in all of Toronto. Everytime i crave for Dim Sum i would often come here in the morning because they serve good quality food, The staff is also very kind and helpful and the service is fast. I don't like those typical chinese cart dim sum cause the food becomes cold and tastes horrible! All the food at dynasty comes out hot right away for you. I would also have to say that this place makes the best Crusty Taro Rolls!! Crunchy on the outside, soft and tasty inside! By far my fave dish and also the almond pudding! I love it!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming here. Food is always great , just like the service. Love their fried rice."}
{"text":"Pink Pearl closed on ave years ago and I thought there would never be another high end, classic, and CLEAN chinese restaurant that I would be wiling to eat at. Dynasty makes all the classic chinese dishes canadians love and then some traditional things as well. The dim sum is amazing, there is really nothing here I haven't loved. It is expensive though quite expensive and they don't deliver far. The service here is excellent, there is one waiter who is a little moody but think thats just him, the rest are the best of the best. Ben is a true gentleman. The decor is a little out there,  reminds me of like a russian cruise ship's dinning room on easter dinner but who cares. There is china and table cloths and cloth napkins and best of all it is clean. Maybe I'm a snob but I just do not trust places in china town and have had too many bad experiences at places in north york, markham and scarb."}
{"text":"The pork buns were absolutely delicious  & the rice noodle and dumpling soup was outstanding. But the bad thing was that the rice noodle & dumpling soup was really BIG!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with thus restaurant. Came to Toronto for a weekend and decided to try some new restaurants and thus one was the biggest disappointment.   Waiter was not very help and did not give recommendations.   Food was below average - the dough of dumplings were very thick and meat used were bad cuts..  Yet at the same time they charge very high prices so this place is pretty bad value for money.   They also put too much oil and salt on everything so the taste was not authentic.   Would definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Pricey compared to Chinese restaurants in Markham, but reasonable given its downtown location.  Their dim sum are high quality, and service is generally very good.    My one complaint is that their hot and soup is very bad.  It tasted like it came from a pre-packaged mix.  I have had better, lots better, in food court.  So, stick with dim sum, avoid the hot and sour soup, and Dynasty is great choice."}
{"text":"Lousy service, amongst the worst and I am fairly familiar with Chinese custom service (not always exceptional) plus I speak chinese. Food is way over priced, frozen dimsum that's reheated. Bad staff, Sloppy cooking. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Dynasty is my favourite dimsum spot in the city for the simple reason that it is not in Chinatown.  Dynasty is fortunately located at the (ritzy) corner of  Bay and Bloor.  Thus, the place is spotless and the washrooms are relatively clean.  Now, I'm a big fan of inhaling a bowl of noodle soup in Chinatown (where I avoid the restaurant washrooms at all costs).  However, the thought of ingesting 4-day old dumplings after being re-steamed does not appeal.  Back to Dynasty and its yummy dimsum.  The dishes are just plain tasty, fresh and familiar.  For the adventurous, I highly recommend a dimsum delicacy called \"Octopus Fingers\" -- keep an open mind and let the tentacles seduce you.  The one downside of Dynasty is they do not push the dimsum carts around,  so you have to order off a menu check-list.  Get there early on weekends (especially during winter) as the wait could get stupid.  They do take reservations.  Parking in the basement garage during weekends is free.  I only go here for brunches because it's just too empty during dinner hours.  I took a group here for dinner a year ago on a Wed evening and we were the only ones there."}
{"text":"Solid dimsum with attentive service. A little pricey, but you get a nice atmosphere and attention to detail. Will run ~$25 per person. The tea cups and tableware are certainly nicer than the average Chinatown dimsum. I usually wouldn't care for dimsum, but since I'm already paying a premium for location, it's a nice bonus to have tableware that's pretty. Bring your hard-to-please or snobby friends.  The new location on Yorkville seems smaller than their former Bloor location, but the decor is updated, bright, and very welcoming. Definitely a fan of the new interior. Service is speedy and professional: empty plates cleared quickly and the teapot refilled promptly.  They serve dimsum to order (rather than carts). Food is flavourful and portions are reasonable. The har gao and cheong fun actually use generously sized whole shrimp. Yay!    It's by no means awesome dimsum in terms of food (you can get the same in many other places), but the overall atmosphere and central location is very nice."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Service: 3/5 Price: way too overpriced.   40 dollars for 5 small dishes and a big bowl of congee? That is seriously overpriced.  They really need to lower the price to attract more traffic (the place was basically empty around 11 on a saturday morning, and only half full around 12:30, when it should be packed!)   Food itself is pretty amazing. I tried a new dish today, baked tapioca with lotus puree, and it was so good that I will most likely go back for this dish a few times next week. Egg tarts was hot juice inside with flaky crust, perfect execution.   How about service? pretentious I would say. They try to be attentive and nice like some other high end restaurants in Yorkville, but you can tell that they simply don't care. What is worse? They give you such a cold face when you don't pay a overly-generous tip (seriously, how can you guys be not happy with 15%??)"}
{"text":"Very expensive and not great food. You just pay location. Make yourself a favor and walk two blocks to younge for a good chines restaurant"}
{"text":"****Do Not Trust This Venue with a Special Event**** i unfortunately made this mistake. please dont make the same. They provided me an invoice in chinese and became hostile when i asked for help translating. The women taking payment from my guests yelled at me and them for no valid reason and even refused to provide help. I believe her behaviour was racially motivated.  You would expect better given the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Big dim sum fun, good quality food here. Expensive due to location etc."}
{"text":"Service here is hit and miss.  Some time you would get a waiter who got out of the wrong side of his bed and would get annoyed because the customers are not well versed with all the nuances of Chinese cuisine.   Just when French waiters are learning some manners now one would have to deal with pompous Chinese waiters."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place based on its attractive ambiance from the outside. While the place looked busy and popular, we were disappointed with the tiny portions. The loud and noisy environment prevented any meaningful conversation and the mediocre service did not help. Not the best experience for a first time customer."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent diner at the restaurant as the food is really decent, we won't deny that. However, we will NEVER return to the restaurant again under any circumstances based on our experience today.    We had a party of three around lunch hour and were seated in the end of the restaurant against the wall with the paintings.  A while after we sat down, our friend, who sat facing the wall across from us said there is a COCKROACH on the painting. We turned around and saw a cockroach crawling on the painting above our heads.  We told one of the wait staffs in a black blazer that there is a cockroach on the painting, he looked and said \"i'm sorry about that\" and walked away.  We honestly thought he was going away to get something to at least take care of it. But no, he came out with tea, sauce for other customers and carried on with his business.  We figured he wasn't going to do anything about it, so we pointed it out to the hostess who just guided some other customers to their seats and she said she'll get the manager, which she did.  The manager, instead of approaching us, grabbed another staff from a distance and told him to take care of it.  This poor staff took a paper napkin and climbed onto the seat next to us and killed the cockroach.. above our heads.  That was the end of the story, not a word from the restaurant as to why there is a cockroach on their wall or a more serious apology, even though we don't really know what to expect when you see a cockroach crawling over your head in a restaurant.  We didn't make a scene for personal reasons but it was disgusting and we will not return again.   I'm not sure what is more disturbing, the cockroach or how the staff handled the situation."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Nothing Spectacular. Clean and prompt service though. A little on the pricy side for Chinese food too, especially when the food wasn't all that great."}
{"text":"Tried their mango pudding yogurt,  shrimp dumplings and sesame beef.  Absolutely delicious,  and would really recommend to anyone.  Totally worth it!  Atmosphere was very classy and the patio gave a great view of the city."}
{"text":"Dim Sum review: Food: Turnip pastry and custard buns were superb. All the dim sum items we had were above average.  Service: Friendly and fast.  Would definitely go back for their dim sum."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Dynasty when I walked in. It was very different than my regular dim sum spot on Gerrard East, Pear Court. Table linens, no carts, beautiful space. We ordered WAY too much food and as a result maybe it spoiled our appetite, but I found the xiu mai inedible. No spices or any taste, they literally tasted like steamed pork. I did like the noodles and bok choy, but for the price there are dim sum spots leaps and bounds better than Dynasty."}
{"text":"The food: They serve dim sum, western Chinese food, and traditional Chinese dishes. Thus it caters to more people. Most of the food are really decent. Some are exceptional and a select few are mediocre. I would highly recommend their egg custard buns as they are top notch. Not really into their vegetarian stuff (though my friend had a different opinion). They also serve dim sum all day so you don't have to wake up early for it. Their Peking duck is not the best I've had but it's definitely up there.   Environment:  Really nice ambience and music. Place seems very clean which is rare with Chinese places. Well decorated. Bathroom is clean.  Service: It's very personal service and staff is friendly. Though I find the staff can be a bit inattentive sometimes. But that was when the place was packed that time so I guess I won't be as harsh.  Price: This place is expensive. Prepare for it. It's easy to enjoy it too much and end up getting a bit of everything or too much food. Don't be shocked when you get your sky rocket bill. They don't mark the prices for dim sum on the order sheet so be careful."}
{"text":"Only ok. Each dish distinctly average, service decidedly absent-minded. Lee Garden, eg, is far better."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened that previous reviewers have spent fortunes on their meals here, but I went as a group of 3 today, and our bill came to $16 each. We had 7 dishes (our favourites being the steamed pork buns and the egg tarts), and I don't think that this was an exorbitant price at all.   Definitely go, and make reservations! This place is parent-friendly, baby-friendly, and even date-friendly. Don't worry about the Yorkville address; while some customers are wearing pearls and dresses, most are wearing smart-casual attire.  My advice would be to the serving staff: a brush-up on manners would be nice, though I can understand that the harried nature of a busy restaurant would affect the servers' patience."}
{"text":"This restaurant should be given a ZERO out of FIVE Stars!  We went in a group of 5 for food here around 4:00pm.  The food was terrible, bland, below average and expensive.  The food serving sizes were small.  Also, the service was very rude and very slow.  We gave them a tip of Zero, Nil, Nada!    Overall, terrible, terrible, terrible.    Please AVOID AVOID AVOID this place!  Plenty of other good restaurants in Yorkville."}
{"text":"This is our favourite Dim Sum in the downtown area.  Our 3 favourite dishes are the spareribs hot pot rice, honey beef short ribs, and the delicious deep fried octopus.  Yum yum dim sum!"}
{"text":"Our favourite Chinese restaurant.   The dim sum on the weekend is great but arrive early or make a reservation as it can by busy.   The Peking duck is incredible and stir fried snow pea greens and beef ribs are also favourites."}
{"text":"Rating should be ZERO.  Waited two hours for a delivery order. Called twice. \"Driver error\". They asked us after two hours to re place the order.  NOPE."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't written a review for this place yet.  My favorite dimsum spot in the city.  I order the typical spread so not much to report except that it meets my expectations.  Of course, dimsum in Hong Kong is better but, you really only have two or three places to go to in Toronto that are close enough."}
{"text":"Dim sum in the heart of Yorkville, honestly coming from Richmond Hill (read: right beside Markham!) I wasn't expecting much. I expected average, bland tasting classics like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork bites wrapped in wonton-like skin). We arrived as a table of 7 on a weekday and the place was fairly empty - understandable, dim sum usually is a longer meal not favoured for a workday lunch hour. We ordered a bit of everything and some of us were looking for specific items - everyone found what they were looking for! There were a decent variety and many classics on the menu - some that aren't often found even in Markham because they're complex to make and don't sell for high prices.  The highlights were the fritter wrapped in rice roll, the osmanthus cake, and the mini octopus in curry sauce. Often the rice rolls are squishy and lack texture, but this one was a good consistency that complemented the crunchy (not chewy!) dough fritter. The osmanthus cake came with a base layer of coconut milk, providing additional flavour and texture that agreed with the table's demands for desserts that're not too sweet but still *something*. We also ordered steamed sponge cake - it was soft and fluffy, steaming hot. The realization the sponge cake was steamed baffled some, and the softness and light flavour was well received. It could've had more of the signature taste, but it was a decent attempt at the classic.  Overall for the location I was pleasantly surprised, and prices were aligned to the area as well. Unfortunately from a dim sum in Toronto perspective, I didn't feel like it was anywhere close to great and it definitely wasn't worth the price paid. Service was good and accommodating to the non-Chinese speakers, but translations were odd and made it more difficult to understand what things were in some cases. I'll be back for team lunches looking for exotic options and a group feeling because we're all at a round table, but aside that I'll stick with my suburb options."}
{"text":"Downtown dim sum spot. Came here for team lunch as an asian group before the holidays.  We ordered quite a variety and the majority were very delicious. It included fried squid, bbq pork buns, beef balls, spring rolls, chicken feet, ha gao, siu mai, curry octopus and mixed pork livers. I thought their fried foods were well made. Others were still pretty good. The only poorly made dish was the beef balls. The colour didn't look right - red in tone, and the texture wasn't exactly normal.  Everything was served fast despite the packed restaurant. As per usual dim sum places, it was really loud but I have always been used to it already. The overall appeal of the restaurant was quite nice with wooden theme paired with purple curtains. Service was good. Price may be on the higher end of normal dim sum places, but again it's Yorkville."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the dismal reviews below are about...    My partner and I have been following this Dynasty for years! As far as consistency goes (cuisine + service), there are not many dim sum spots in Toronto that can compare to Dynasty. A lot have come and gone, yet, Dynasty prevails.  O.K., I preferred their original roomier location on Bloor Street. But, their newest space in Yorkville is nice enough, if anything, a bit more intimate and more formal in effect.   Here's what I always order, and highly recommend: har gow, siu mai, steamed spareribs with black bean sauce, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf with chicken, rice crepe with minced beef and watercress, turnip pastries, crusty taro dumplings, baby bok choy in supreme broth, and turnip cakes. Stuffed you'll be, but, nicely!  The senior dining room service team at Dynasty have been with the operation for many years now, and this says a lot. They are always professional when we visit. We also appreciate their wine list - one can actually find a bottle of Ontario Pinot Noir for purchase.   Clearly, one can't go wrong dim-summing here."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto with friends and family and the hotel concierge recommended us to try this place. The food was fantastic, but surprisingly the service was awesome. The staff managed to fit us in last minute and despite the restaurant being packed, they were very attentive and helpful.   We ordered off both the main menu and the dim sum menu, both were very good. We tried their dessert, which was just as good. Give this place a go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They do a decent job of Chinese food. They must pay a lot of rent to be in this location. Doss is not cheap. But it's good and tastes more refined places around. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Only the prices are premium.   At breakfast I was thinking to myself \"how come there's no such thing as a Chinese restaurant with a patio?\" So when I stumbled across this place this evening it felt like destiny. But if that's the case, I must have done some bad stuff to deserve this fate.  I've had high-end Chinese food before with good results. That place at harbor castle is worth the premium price. And there was an extravagant dim sum place at a hotel on Chestnut a few years back that had crazy prices but the foods really was a cut above normal Chinese fare.  Dynasty has the crazy prices, but the food here would be disappointing at any price. Crystal prawns for example, are basically some garlic shrimp and broccoli with a $25 price tag. Hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. Szechwan tofu was terribly bland. Asparagus with mushroom came with three asparagus spears hidden under a mound of overcooked mushrooms drowning in sauce. Worst of all was the BBQ duck. Worst and most boring duck ever. No hint of the normal Chinese BBQ flavor.    If you're already in Yorkdale, eat elsewhere. If you're coming here for premium Chinese food, don't. You'll be much better off picking any other Chinese place at random."}
{"text":"Dynasty is conveniently located in the heart of T.O.'s posh Bloor/Yonge neighborhood.  If you need a hearty dim sum lunch in between your \"economy-be-damned\" luxury shopping trip at Holt Renfrew and surrounding boutiques, this is the place to be.  If you're in a group, that's great.  Large banquet tables dominate in preparation for the wedding reception that might be booked that evening.  The sky, clouds and doves painted above, surrounding the crystal chandelier don't exactly fit the cuisine, but that's ok.  The best dim sum places in the city don't usually have understandable decor.    My favorite shrimp dumplings are huge here.  The steamed rice in lotus leaves are fragrant.  The fried cruller wrapped in flat white noodle dish to be dipped in peanut sweet sauce was another fave.  Man, this is what I get homesick for living in New York.  My sister, in her pregnancy-fueled odd-food-craving phase ordered a curry octopus dish.  After much convincing to try it, it turned out to be one of the more tasty and interesting dishes.  The octopus more close resembled a very tender and soft calamari, (if you cringe at tentacles, go for the domed, soft, mushroom shaped pieces instead) in a rich, slicy spicy yellow curry broth."}
{"text":"Honestly, people who complain about the dim sum menu and its \"strange\" system of S, M, L, etc... don't quite understand dim sum pricing, period.  Sizing is fairly \"standard\" among dim sum and as for pricing, if you go to an old school cart service restaurant, you're not going to get prices, either.  Just a slip which servers stamp when each dish comes.  As for the dim sum itself, it was a bit better when the restaurant was on Bloor Street (where La Societe is now), but overall, it is still good.  Dinner is good as well, and like its neighbour, Lee Chen Bistro, the restaurant more Jook Sing-friendly than many places in Markham - they don't find a person of Chinese descent who cannot read the language, odd (and why SHOULD restaurants?  What a way to lose customers!).  Prices are fairly reasonable for the area.  Remember, people, it's YORKVILLE, not Chinatown - or even Markham."}
{"text":"Just because they moved from Bloor St to Yorkville, doesn't make it any better.  I remember not really liking it before, but though we would try it again for lunch.   On a cold winters day, they said they did not have any small tables left for me and my mom - only big tables left, at least 4 of them (8-10 seaters, not reserved).  Instead they put is in the left corner, by the windows, and it was freezing. I couldn't take off my jacket. They had a heater there that wasn't working. We had asked them to move us when there was a seat, and saw that a guy (party of 1) who came in after us got seated inside.  My mom made a bit of a scene, until they finally allowed us to sit at the large table. I mean, they didn't have to clear it - we could have easily shared that table with others, but maybe in Yorkville they do not do that. And it wasn't like a huge group was coming in trying to sit there either, these 4 tables remained empty the entire time as I watched them turn away customers.   The service in general I felt was terrible. Yes, there were people around, but I personally felt like they were rude to us, especially during this seating debacle. We were ready to leave, maybe we should have. Rude to only their own kind (Chinese) but seems so damn polite to Westerners. I couldn't imagine people who continue coming here they way we were treated.  Since we moved tables, we asked for our tea - and the waiter just brushed us off, and walked away.    The dim sum wasn't especially tastey either and very over priced. Small was $4, M was $5 and L was $6. XL was $8 and most of the food was XL. We also got a Beef Stir Fry Rice Noodle (Dry StirFried Beef Ocean) - $18 ?!?!  The food was either oversalty or bland. The XO Turnip Cake was way too floury and was not cooked long enough, with no taste at all. The only saving grace was the congee, which was tastey. Something you can't really screw up."}
{"text":"Thought I would check this place out with my family because it was close by and had decent reviews on Yelp, but this place was such a disappointment.  The restaurant seems to want to check people- they charged us $4 per person for tea without telling us. Tea is generally free at Chinese restaurants.  Other thing is that there's no price on their dim sum menu so we were really surprised by the bill.  We went cause people said their dim sum was good, but we all found it to be terrible. We had pork dumplings - the dough was really thick. The Shanghai soup dumplings were also a disappointment- the meat inside was red so it looked like they didn't use fresh meat for the dish. The short ribs were too salty.  Overall, it was a huge disappointment and we would never go back or recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"i had one of the best meals of my LIFE here! Never tried the dim sum, but the combo meals are A 1 the combo that includes lobster was my favourite I get that its too expensive for some but when I want to go somewhere  for a special occasion and eat like a queen, this is one of my gems i've found  I didn't even want to share my experience because I felt like it was my own special spot but honestly they deserve it! Consitantly good"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and overpriced (not surprised due to its prime location being in Yorkville). Nothing spectacular except for the egg yolk bun, which is pretty good!"}
{"text":"In a pinch this place will do. Conveniently located downtown with parking nearby, this is a great Chinese place if one doesn't want to deal with the Chinatown mess."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum and Chinese food  Nice view of Bloor Street and close to great shopping and key attractions  Always glad to go back for a meal"}
{"text":"This is a great place for some upscale Chinese food.  First off while the service is average, its super fast and quick. Dishes come out quickly and piping hot. They don't smile but as long as my food gets to me quickly and efficiently I don't care.  They are a couple of dishes you need to try.  1) Beef and Mushroom Hot Pot  This dish is amazing. The beef is filet cut super thin. Its sooooo soft and tender. The beef and mushrooms and cooked slightly in the back and then that with raw green onions and put into a super hot pot and finished at your table. The beef is always cooked to perfection and the hot pot adds a level of depth of flavor that you wont find in any other dish or cooking method. the sauce is light..made of the juices from the mushrooms and beef.  Great dish.  2) General Tao Chicken  Yes I know everyone has one. But this one is different then any other I have had. The sauce is light and red...almost like a sweet and spicy red chili sauce. The chick is lightly battered and its super soft and moist. Fried crispy and light...doesn't eat heavy. My only suggestion is the sauce coats the chicken almost like candy, so ask for extra sauce that way the chicken is fully coated in sauce and there is plenty on the bottom of the plate to redip or pour on your rice.  Great restaurant. Good fresh high quality Chinese food."}
{"text":"Have to say this is really top notch. Clean excellent service with amazing menu, high quality seafood, meat and produce.   Menu is marked with S,M,L,XXL these are not sizes they show you the price range. I was a little concerned that there were no prices shown on the menu but in the end I found great value for what I ordered.     The service was excellent, and the waiter made some good recommendations.    I have been here for dinner and Dim Sum and both times were excellent."}
{"text":"With vegetarians in our group, we entered the place with some element of doubt as Chinese food is not very vegetarian friendly. We were quickly put to calm looking at the available options and also the waiter himself understanding the needs of a vegetarian pallette. The food was definitely very tasty and the service was really good. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the ambience and the taste itself did not hit the ball out of the park."}
{"text":"Hands down best dim sum I've ever had, better than Michelin star grade dim sum I've had in China.   The har gow are incredible - generous size, very juicy and no doughy taste like many other locations in the city. The rice noodle w/ spicy sauce is to die for and is worth the visit itself.   Dynasty may be a little pricier than other spots in the city, but I believe this is due to the quality and not the Yorkville location.   Highly underrated in the yelp world!"}
{"text":"Expensive dim sum for your Asian mother but cheap eats in the area.    Sadly the best dim sum place I find in Toronto ."}
{"text":"We worked hear by the restaurant so we went there for dim sum but the minute we walked in the waiters in the front were not smiling at all. We Sat down and ask for hot sauce and they were really rude. My friend's plate were dirty and as asked for a new plate and the waiter gave her a new one and place the dirty one on another table.  The food was good but the service there is horrible.  They are little racist and when we ask for fortune cookies they threw the cookies on the table.  I don't think I will go back to the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Holy shu mai, Batman - this is the most expensive dim sum in all the land! The tab for just two people of only average-sized appetites (we only over-ordered by about 1 dish) came out to $70 not including tip. *balk* Whoa.   Having said that, the dim sum is actually excellent. We loved the har gow with roe garnish, and the siu mai with a little slice of krab on top. The service was probably the best out of any dim sum joint I've ever been to. They don't use carts here; instead, you just check off quantities on a little paper slip (like you do at many sushi restaurants). Not having the ability to peep inside carts was an initial disappointment.  However, when each dish came to us super fresh and piping hot, I became a convert of the \"to order\" method!   I'd recommend this place for some amazing dim sum -- but only if your pockets are feeling a little heavy, or if someone else is paying. ;) It's really good and close to my apartment, but it definitely won't be a regular haunt for me."}
{"text":"Average dim sum. Ridiculous prices.  The space is nice, kind of formal but as a result somewhat gaudy. They do have loads of room though, so it's perfect for large groups. The service is pretty good and there are no carts. Just order off the menu. No prices on the menu, but I figured it would be pretty standard for dim sum. For the two of us, we ordered a pretty standard combination of dumplings, rice crepes, taro balls, etc. I didn't think that we ordered a hell of a lot. So when the bill came to $73 with tax and tip, I nearly fell out of my chair. I don't think I've ever paid more than $25 per person for dim sum. I should have investigated what exactly put our bill over the edge, but at that point I was stuffed and irritated, so we just signed away and left.  The burbs and Spadina area require more effort but are probably worth heading to instead. If you have a large group, this place might be more accommodating with parking and space."}
{"text":"Your restaurant is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in all of Toronto in terms of taste and flavor.  There is one problem. You so !@#$!# expensive. For example, Mayo Prawns 26.95, General Tao's Chicken 17.95.   Those aren't magic prawns. That's not a royal hand fed chicken.  I understand you are in Yorkville and yes, rent is expensive. However, you overdid it.  If your prices made sense I would recommend this to EVERYONE. Alas, your prices aren't sensible. That is why I go to Lee Chen instead."}
{"text":"You are pretty much settling for 3 stars when you go for dim sum downtown in Toronto. The best options are Lai Wah Heen and Dynasty which is a great location but both serve slightly better than average dim sum for very little value.  If I don't feel like driving North to a much better and great value dim sum then I default to Dynasty. All the other places just have \"dim sum\" on the menu but aren't any good or just plain bad.  If you really want good dim sum, you have to go North. Ask a friend or make friends with someone who knows Richmond or Markham."}
{"text":"Tried the new Dynasty for the first time yesterday lunch. Very fine decoration, tableware, and friendly service, much more so than in old location. Dim sum were excellent, fresh, hot, not served off carts or all at once. Har gow full of shrimp, BBQ pork slices meaty, and a Thai chicken steamed in leaf (never before tried) excellent. Same with a vegetarian \"fortune\". In other words, a huge list of dim sum--with no clunkers that we could find."}
{"text":"The food is good but not really the place that you want to come alone. Lunch time noisy with lots of crying children."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite place in Toronto to get peking duck. You can order just a half duck and easily share it between two people.   I like this place so much my fiance and I got a little out of hand on valentines day and ended up eating an entire duck. \"You do know why have half ducks right?\", \"yes, we know, we figure we can take half of the duck home\". An hour later the entire thing was gone. I've never seen servers so disgusted yet fascinated with our ability.  Recently went to the new location for dim sum. It was good but a little overpriced in comparison to places in chinatown."}
{"text":"Very good. Food delicious. Well priced for the quality of food. Don't move! Some waiters could be more polite."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a decade. I've probably had at least 200 meals here.  Most people know this place for the dim sum. While the dim sum is  good, it's only excellent for certain dishes.  I'd recommend going for DINNER. It's hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.  -Beef & Mushroom hotpot -Rice noodles with Satay chicken -Crispy Grouper (or scallops) and Asparagus [complain if the batter is too heavy. it should be very light batter.] -Cream of Corn Grouper -Lemon chicken (I probably wouldn't order this anywhere else. sweet and sour pork used to be good... now it's too soggy.)   They have quite a diverse menu... peking duck, roast pork, various seafood, etc.  The service is normally excellent. This is a great place to go if you need good service at a party, or if you're impressing someone."}
{"text":"I went to Dynasty a couple of weeks ago on a weekend for Dim Sum. I was impressed by the clean presentation of the restaurant, especially compared to most Dim Sum places I've visited.  The service was relatively good: polite staff who paid attention to you, and the food arrived quick (but too mysteriously TOO quick).  The quality of the food was up there for what it was, and if you like Dim Sum you probably will like this place. All in all, I would consider returning.  My only issue was with one move by the staff/management: When a table orders a dish a la carte and the table changes their mind or simply doesn't want it... DON'T try to pawn it off on another table as a \"special\". Seriously, stop. That's a ridiculously cheap move especially for a restaurant in Yorkville that's supposed to upscale.   Be classy Dynasty you'll be alllllright."}
{"text":"We had dim sum at Dynasty today.   The positives: - great food quality - nice ambiance - quick service - central location (Bay/Yorkville)  The negatives - - very expensive  We really enjoyed the meal but OMG - came away with sticker shock.  If you like dim sum including seafood specialties as a part of it - you will find Dynasty pretty expensive - dishes ranged between $5-8.  So count on $25-30 a head.  There is a Green P parking lot nearby.   Pt"}
{"text":"We were wandering through Yorkville and looking for something to eat when we spotted Dynasty Chinese Cuisine. Dim sum in the middle of Yorkville? Sure, why not.  We requested a seat on their patio and the waiting began. Our waiter finally showed up with menus a few minutes later but honestly, I was baffled (and a little annoyed) by its vagueness. The dim sum menu is devoid of prices, and since our waiter appeared only sporadically, we had to wait a while before we could even begin choosing our food. (Like, if everything is going to cost $10, we certainly weren't going to stay. And because this is Yorkville, that's absolutely a possibility.)  Anyway, he finally explained the menu and the costs, so we decided to order six items. The food was all fine. There were no really distinctive flavors to be found but everything was prepared relatively well. (We did get a short-rib dish that was basically inedible due to a preponderance of bone and cartilage, however.)  I had to wait a while to start eating, though, because I needed a fork and, surprise surprise, our waiter was nowhere to be found.  With service like this and food that's just barely passable, it's hard to envision returning."}
{"text":"meh, just another chinese restaurant. this one comes with an expensive price tag.  the venue is nice, great location (yorkville) and the service is good. but the food is pretty typical, nothing special.   there are much better places in Richmond Hill, Chinatown and on Baldwin Street."}
{"text":"I visited dynasty for dimsum only. Overall impression is that this restaurant is average when it comes to food but has far better service than other Chinese restaurants - it tailors mainly to non Chinese clientele by making the menu very English friendly. However you will be paying for this convenience! I've never seen such high prices for food I'd consider rather average in quality and taste."}
{"text":"I love the new location. The old place in the Colonnade on Bloor was great because of the free parking and the fact that it was almost always empty. Dynasty has the same menu, same great food. I can't say enough about the freshness and authenticity of the food. Again, if you want cheap stuff,  go to Spadina and Dundas."}
{"text":"We did not have a reservation. The hostess told us 20 Minutes wait. After 60 minutes we decided to leave. It was busy, but would have appreciated them managing our expectation. Not good service."}
{"text":"My overall experience was tarnished by the lack of attention and slow servers.  Drinks took forever to arrive and we had to ask multiple times for glasses of water.  Now that, that is out of the way, the food was good.  Expect to pay a bit more because of it's location, but there are few alternatives in the Yorkville area.  The Dim Sum was good.  All of the standard items were standard.  I feel that most were fresh made so that is a bonus.  The duck was very good and served as two courses.  I also really liked the Shanghai noodles.  if it were not for the service, I would have given this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Last week, I decided to get take out from a nearby restaurant. They said it would take twenty minutes, so I decided to walk around instead of waiting at the restaurant. I had killed some time and by the time I had looped around, I thought hey maybe I can grab one of my favorite treats as dessert. Dynasty was right there, so I went upstairs, proceeded to the counter, looked at their priceless* dim sum menu and ordered one order of the steamed egg yolk custard buns.  I said priceless with an * because I wanted to explain that it didn't have a price next to the items... Not because there menu is super precious. Boy did I ever experience sticker shock. Yes, I do remember Dynasty is over priced and the food is average here. But when I paid over $10 for three tiny buns...I couldn't help but think: didn't I pay just four dollars for three of these, but slightly larger ones, at Rol San a few weeks ago?   Okay, so maybe the quality is why it's priced higher, I thought. So after eating amazing Indian food for dinner, I dug into the custard buns. The filing is kinda dry... Atop of this, there's some weird film/coating around the \"custard\"/yolk. I assume it's edible, because it's in all three, and I ate it. But if I had to compare it against other custard buns that I've had... I'd much prefer a creamy custard instead of something dried up. I don't think of custards as something dried up ever.  There was a time when the buns were good here... Years ago. Its a shame because the other items in the menu here really are average and over priced."}
{"text":"Overpriced, yes. Worth the price? Well...4 stars explains that it's slightly not. Nevertheless, it's still good for Bloor-Yorkville quality.  I've only went for dim sum, so no opinion for dinner. Their siu mai is excellent, I agree. This place is also my favourite for their curry octopus, and the scallop dumplings they have is unique from all the chinese restaurants I've been to. The beef/veggie noodle rolls is a little too much on the veggie side, which I don't like. Also, not a lot of MSG, and quite healthy too.  Total came to about $50 for 4. Usually I pay $25-30 for 3, so it's only a tad more expensive."}
{"text":"Sorry to rain on the parade, but after my pricey lunch here today I was left longing for my ole' Chinese haunts in SF. Not sure where to start my rant, perhaps the psychotic christmas lights paired with plastic plants which makes dining fun when you are doing the lunchtime dive but at $14 bucks plus for a lunch entree we deserve a bit better presentation than what was experienced today. I got the feeling Dynasty is trying just a bit too hard.. so with the white table cloth service it may be time to lose the paper napkin. The Jasmine Tea was lovely, as was the standard fair but no big shake. Won't be back..."}
{"text":"If there is one piece of valuable advice I can offer you kindly reader, it is this:  Never and I mean NEVER visit a dim sum restaurant unless you have a trustworthy recommendation on hand.  Too many a public washroom has been victim to dim sum ignoramuses for me to not write this review.  If you want Dim Sum in Toronto, go to Dynasty on Bloor.  The restaurant offers up a traditional Chinese breakfast on carts that are wheeled around the massive, second floor space quickly and methodically.  The space is clean and the Chinese delicacies - some misting up in their bamboo steamers, others sizzling on their plates - are all fresh and hot.    If you are looking for China town cheap, you won't find it at Dynasty.  But look at things this way; you will save money by not being able to go shopping on Bloor Street after...You will be way too full."}
{"text":"To start, I'll say that the food was good, but certainly not worth the cost.  Dinner for four was $146, plus tip.  Entries were about $18 each - even an order of chicken fried rice was $17.    However, it was one of the strangest dinners I've ever had in an \"upscale\" restaurant.  We were a party of four. Two of us ordered appetizers (hot & sour soup and dumplings). All of us ordered entries (four chicken dishes, and 1 chicken fried rice).    First the soup arrived, about 20 minutes after we ordered.  Then about 10 minutes later the dumplings arrived.  Next, my sweet & sour chicken arrived, about 15 minutes after the dumplings arrived.  I assumed that everything else would come arrive at the same time, but NOOOOOO....  the next chicken dish arrived about 10 minutes later, and then finally the two remaining chicken dishes arrived. about 10 minutes later.  Essentially, everyone ate consecutively, instead of together.    Very strange.  We finished and got our bill about 15 minutes later.  The dinner lasted 2 hours."}
{"text":"Love coming here for dim sum.  Food is consistently good. They also have big tables for big groups."}
{"text":"Came here twice. DimSum is more expensive in dinner than in the morning and lunch. But all of them just taste awesome, never disappointing me"}
{"text":"It's a cold winter day. I went in with a half finished coffee in my hand with my friend. The waiter who greeted us asked us to finish them at the door because they do not allow us to drink them inside. I consider this to be a very rude and unreasonable ask so I decided to go to another restaurant. I brought my friend to here since I have been here and we were just nearby, but I regret doing this so much now."}
{"text":"Good service and great dimsum. Prices are a little higher but that goes without saying for the location and beautiful ambience."}
{"text":"Best sesame chicken I've ever had! Awesome clams in black bean sauce. Skip the fried rice - mushy and greasy. Service is 1/5 stars. But our food was so good I've given this place a 4!"}
{"text":"Came here few times and never disappointed, excellent service and friendly staff, all the foods were served in high quality and used with fresh ingredients, I did try a lot of Chinese cuisines restaurant in town, what I say is, more or less were the same, but did the chef really use the HEART to cook and design the cuisines, I am sure everyone can tell. I am willing to paid more to enjoy the nice foods and stay in a comfortable environment.If you ask me the choices, Dynasty is the one. Recommended - Lobster with garlic sauce Har gow, siu Mai Oven baked radish cakes"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 star joint. Really, one of the only places you'll find in Yorkville that does Dim Sum. The food is good, not excellent, but just right. Prices are fair, and services is excellent. If i've got a craving for Dim Sum in Yorkville, this is a no brainer."}
{"text":"Best meal during our recent visit to Toronto! Skip Chinatown and enjoy the nice ambience and great food at Dynasty. We ate dim sum and also ordered from the dinner menu. Absolutely delicious. Next trip this is one of the first places we'll be heading!"}
{"text":"5* for the yummy expensive but high quality dim sum. 3* for their overpriced, not so special super expensive and disappointing dinner menu.  But the service here was always really great with respectful smiling waiters!"}
{"text":"Food is okay but OVERPRICED. Very impatient and unfriendly waitress, they were condescending."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum today as a work lunch. 7 of us ordered and shared the below. Everything was very good.   Shiu mai Har gow, shrimp Steamed Rice Crepe with Dough Stick Steamed Pork Spareribs with Black Bean Spice Steamed Chicken Feet with Soya Bean Sauce Steamed Mini Octopus with Curry Sauce Steamed Rice Crepe with B.B.Q. Pork Steamed Rice with Preserved Vegetable and Spare Ribs Baked B.B.Q. Pork Puffs Homemade Fresh Tofu in Ginger Syrup Chilled Mango Pudding Baked Tapioca with Lotus Puree (MY FAVE!! - the best thing we ordered) Flaky Baked Egg Tarts  My faves were the shiu mai, har gow, fresh tofu and the baked tapioca. The baked tapioca is now my new favourite dessert. For the seven us it came to $25.25 per person. We were satisfied with the quality, taste and portion. Definitely going back to try more."}
{"text":"Perhaps Yorkville wasn't the greatest place to look for dim sum, but it was convenient.   The food mediocre at best. I ordered hot and sour soup, steam ribs, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings and the tripe. The only item I throughly enjoyed was the steamed ribs in the black bean sauce.  Next time I will walk to Chinatown for Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"I had really expected this place to be overpriced and not very good but after dealing with the lousy service and dingy interiors of the places in Chinatown I was willing to give it a try. Boy was I surprised.  The service was much better, the food was very good and the bill was very reasonable ($40 for two for dim sum).  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times to Dynasty and find it one of the better Chinese restaurant downtown. From dim sum to fine Chinese dishes, the quality and taste of food is definitely worthy of every dollar although a little pricey. But its in par with its location being in Yorkville! Its also convenient to get too. Interior is clean and definitely upperscale. Cannot compare to the Chinatown Chinese restaurants. I usually have dim sum here, but this time going with a friend who knew Chinese food well, we ordered from an appetizer of pork with garlic to buddha jumping over the wall soup , a tasty dish of deep friend tofu and finishing off with a tasty dessert (which I definitely recommend). Being a dessert person, I would certainly recommend the Bird's Nest dessert in coconut milk option. It wasn't too sweet and the bird's nest laden on top of the coconut milk was a sizeable portion.  Certainly a good place to go if you're craving for Chinese food around in the Yorkville area."}
{"text":"Mmmm, overpriced dim sum.  I gotta admit, even though the dim sum is pricy ($5.95 per dish) everything was fan-freaking-tastic. Exceptionally fresh and very homemade looking. No frozen shite here.  Try the peanut & chicken chiu chow dumplings - they were amazing and I haven't seen them on other dim sum menus. Yum.  The standards were good too (har gow, siu mai, pork buns, custard rolls)  I was *this* close to giving Dynasty 4 stars until I saw on my bill that they charged me $16.95 for STEAMED BOK CHOY. Jesus H Christ, Mother of God!!!! $16.95???? Really? Good thing this was going to be expensed.  Decor is nice (can't fault the colour purple) and service was great.   Come here if you have $$$$ to burn!!!"}
{"text":"Pseudo-classy tables and napkins but dishes and presentations are poor for the price. Food is just / not even OK (or simply not good at all...). Staff is OK, at least..."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Such great dishes but the worst service ever. A friend and I had ordered soup, spring rolls and one main dish to share. It took 30 minutes for the spring rolls, and then my main dish was served before my soup. Which took almost an hour. They refused to split the bill for us as well. All the staff are incredibly rude. Would recommend for the food but not for fast or good service."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese restaurant ! LOVE the atmosphere and the food was great along with the people working here were very friendly! Clean, nice, cool design of the place. Overall good. 5 stars. :"}
{"text":"They are at a new location since my last review years ago.  The new location is more accessible, the service is far more polite and the ambience is somewhat less pretentious.  I like their dim sum but there's room for improvement in the smell of oil in the fried items and flavour of the steamed items.  What I love is their fish soup/entrées, with an order of noodles, but it can get very pricey."}
{"text":"I was really wanting to have some dim sum so I went to Dynasty. I have eaten here before but at the old location so I was pretty sure the food was good.  The decor was OK.   We ordered the regular dim sum items which are har gow - sui mei -  We also ordered the deep fried taro(very good) mini octopus in curry sauce. Octopus fingers and bak choy. It was pricey! I certainly can not say that the dim sum here is any better than other places I have tried.  The service was excellent! The food was pretty much the same as any other decent dim sum place. I believe the prices are better in China Town. I think the location is great. They have an outdoor patio if you like people watching its perfect.  I may go back... not sure. I found it to be pretty pricey"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I was hopeful and then my expectations were completely shot down.  I eat dim sum at excellent places all the time and I fully expected this place to do well in my expectations --good area, good reviews, busy on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum. I took my companion as a first timer fully expecting this to be satisfactory.  BOY WAS I WRONG.  I was sorely disappointed. By the food, by the service, and especially by the treatment of the staff when we encountered problems with the food.  The first warning sign was that the congee didn't arrive with any condiments or offers of condiments: pepper, peanuts, spring onions typically come standard. The congee was bland and clearly hadn't absorbed any of the flavors of the meat and egg ingredients.  The second warning was the piece of metal found in one of the siu mai... Discovered by chewing on it. When this was discovered, it was promptly reported to a waiter and the metal shard was whisked away quickly. Nothing was done. We reported this to another head waiter. He made an excuse for it and nothing was done about it.   We kept eating.  The third and final straw was the loooong stand of brown hair (my hair is black and my companion's is very short) found in the congee wrapped around a piece of pork. Delicious! Again we reported to another head waiter who made the excuse that the hair came from some thing while cleaning (!). By the way... That is not any better.  He apologized and took it away and didn't charge us for the congee.   We were completely turned off at that point. Our bill was not comped but we didn't wish to put up a fuss. What was most startling to us was that no one seemed to even blink an eye when these problems were discovered and nothing was done to rectify the problem.  I wish I had taken photographic evidence of this. You can't make this stuff up.  **AVOID AT ALL COSTS**"}
{"text":"So so Chinese restaurant in the exclusive Yorkville area.  Came here for dinner with some friends who wanted to try this place. The Peking duck meat was rather dry. The other dishes were just ok.  Not worth it for the price of $180 for the 5 of us with tips and no alcohol."}
{"text":"First off, while this place is well known for its Dim Sum, I haven't actually eaten Dim Sum there as I am not a big Dim Sum person.   My review is based on some of the other Chinese dishes I typically eat when I go there. Their BBQ pork and their General Tso's chicken are both so delicious. I have had a variety of their dishes and none of them have disappointed, including the duck.   Since this is close to where I live it is convenient, but like most things in the area, you will pay a slight premium given the location."}
{"text":"The service is good but the taste of food is so so. I order peking duck which is not bad  but sauce is too salty . They slice duck skin with lot of meat so it is hard to chew. Duck meat turn to be fried with vegetable which has no taste. Decoration are nice. Overall , it is not good or not bad . If you looking for a luxuary Chinese place , this is the one."}
{"text":"The menu is baffling, but it's not rocket science. Here's a primer.  If you show up for dim sum (and you should) avoid the leather menu. All that concerns you is the carbon one-pager that features all their options. And there are a lot of options. Beside each item you'll find designations like S, M, L, XXL and XXXL. Note that these are not sizes. Let me say that again: THESE ARE NOT SIZES.   This is Dynasty's poorly chosen shorthand for pricing levels. Could they have gone a different way with this? Sure. Should they have? Of course. They could have used dollar signs ($, $$, $$$). Or a drawing of Buddha getting fatter. Or you know, the actual fucking prices. For some reason they don't do this. Why not? Do dumpling prices fluctuate on the stock market? They even print a disclaimer to emphasize how timely the prices are. I don't get it.  But there's no point bitching about it. I asked the server about the prices and before I could finish my sentence she had evaporated into thin air (like Nightcrawler) and rematerialized with the prices written out by hand. No problemo. I took a photo for you, and as you can see it's neither terribly expensive nor super-cheap. This might offend purists who insist on Old World pricing and need the food to be simultaneously mind-blowing on all levels. I'm not one of those assholes: the eats were solid.   As for the restaurant, it's pretty in there (more than Chinatown spots) and it was bustling on a Sunday morning. We hadn't made a reservation so we were seated in a tiny windowless cell down a hidden corridor. There were at most five tables in there. This was obviously the Losers' Lounge. Fair enough. Service in the Losers' Lounge was a little lacking (as you would expect in a room devoted to rejects) but once we got our orders in the foodstuffs came out hot and fast.  Sui mai, har gow, and steamed pork buns were all winners. For dessert we snagged some sesame balls (OK) and mango pudding (more-than-OK). I would definitely return, and make a reservation too.   Obligatory Title Pun: DYNA-mite.  Menu Readability: Complete bullshit.  Need to mention: Definitely order the rice roll with barbecue pork.  What this place teaches me about myself: I can live with the Losers' Lounge so long as dumplings are involved."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to grab dim sum in the city. Like. I'm speechless for once. The service is incredibly quick and attentive. I had very personalized service.   --- Drinks ---  The Sake is brought out at exactly the correct temperature. It is poured properly in accordance with the culture. It was a beautiful sight to see.   --- Dim Sum ---  It is brought quickly, not to let it get cold. It is the perfect dim sum. I am lost for words. It does not break and is not under or over cooked.  The Shrimp (Har Gow) is perfect. Flawless.  The pork dumplings were excellent.  The vegetarian dumplings were just short of perfection. But almost there.   --- Service ---   It was beyond quick. They are kind. Helpful. What else would you dream of?  --- Overall ---  This is not for the cheap. You will spend around 10 per order of dim sum (4 pieces.)  Dim sum is shared with the table, so you are expected to order multiple types. The bill should run you 50 per person. At least. But it is worth every penny. Enjoy your meal. Because it will be well worth it."}
{"text":"We went there for vegetarian food.   Cindy, who served us, was very accommodating and arranged for tofu and vegetarian fried rice. The food was served fast and was very good."}
{"text":"You can truly taste the difference in quality of dim sum of Dynasty compared to other dim sum places downtown Toronto.  The dishes are flavourful and fresh.  I highly recommend calling in to reserve a table, otherwise expect to wait 20-30 mins for one."}
{"text":"I and my wife have been to Chinese restaurants all over the world.  Living in Toronto, and it is convenient, we go to this restaurant for our Chinese meals.  It has always been fair, and service was okay.  However, the last time we were there, a week ago, the food was not as usual. Granted, there are some bad days, in among all the good. We called the wait staff over, and voiced our feelings about the meal.  Surprisingly, the answer we got was NOT what we expected.  No apology for the badly prepared dish, not an offer to substitute, and was charged for the dish that we hardly ate. We paid and left, with a bitter taste in our mouths. I know the owner, and in writing this, I hope he gets word of the episode.  The wait staff was rude, with an attitude of \"IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, TOO BAD\". That is terrible PR, and it will be a long time before I go back.  They just lost a weekly customer.  Art"}
