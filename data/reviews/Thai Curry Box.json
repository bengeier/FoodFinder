{"text":"Went here for a late lunch. Got Chicken red curry, Chicken Pad siew, and as we were being adventurous... a Sunday special of beef jerky and papaya salad. 

1st impressions?.. CLEAN! doesn't mean I won't eat at take out places because they are a little grimy ... but I DO SO appreciate when owners take the time to keep their business clean. 

Price point - really good for the amount of food that you get... My first comment when it was handed to me was \"woah! it's heavy\" YES! I LOVE good value. 

Food: SO Tasty! We both got \"medium heat\" which was a little too hot for me... but I'm a wuss when it comes to heat... and it didn't stop me from finishing both my dish... and my partner's... ... and the papaya salad.  Veggies were fresh and cooked just right (still crunchy, not soggy) and my partner remarked \"hey chicken has it's own taste... y'know ... not like \"this is protein covered with sauce\"\" The papaya salad was a nice way of cutting through the curry... refreshing and crunchy. 

Service: Maybe I was lucky, but the chef came out personally to make sure that I was enjoying my food! WHAT!!! so cool. Turns out he makes the curry paste himself! 

Totally worth the mission :)"}
{"text":"Yummy authentic thai food with a nice customizable kick. Had the most amazing pad thai ( very fresh and made to order) and I loveee the chicken wings.

Would definitely come back to try more food! 
Way better than Thai Express, Salad King and Thai Basil.... Mmm this review is making me crave more thai curry food...

This place is truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I went there today because my wife went there on Sunday.

WOW!  Was I impressed.

The restaurant is in the heart of Mount Pleasant Village in NorthWest Brampton.  It's a little hard to find due to the limited roads leading into the square.

Even if you're a Bramptonian; you may not know how to get there.

Anyways, enough about that.

The menu has the traditional Thai choices: Pad Thai, Pad Siew, Red, Green, Yellow Curries, etc.  But the best thing about this place is that it is authentic and tasty.

I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken Lunch Special which included an incredibly tasty large Mango Salad.  What can I say?

I \"almost\" had an experience when eating the food.  I had to say \"almost\" because I asked for the hottest they could give me.  But it wasn't as hot as I would have liked it.  I know I'll have to ask for hotter next time.  But it was delicious.  The mixture of flavours, freshness and the taste.

I had to confirm, but the store is actually run by Thai owners, which I confirmed while waiting for the food.

Be aware, this place is not open on Mondays, but open all other days of the week.

Lastly, as an incentive, they have a rewards program.  Buy ten meals, and get the eleventh free!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm hoping since they're pretty new, that they'll improve. But I'm very disappointed after eating there for dinner. Nothing on the menu has any flavor!!!!

Their green curry chicken seemed to be made from water, green food coloring, and spicyness. Any coconut cream that may have been in it has been watered down beyond recognition. It also contained a lot of potatoes. They should be honest and call it \"green water potatoes\" on the menu.

Their spring rolls were decent, but the sauce that came with them tasted like water.

Their mango salad was just a container of sliced mango, with no detectable sauce or salad dressing on them.

Their phad thai was the best thing they made, but still just average if you compared it to any other Thai restaurant.

The boxes they serve you with look very cool, and somehow are able to hold water without leaking out or soaking through. I don't know how that works, so I'm just going to assume it's magic."}
