{"text":"Far better then Bennett's for breakfast.  Very clean.  Barkeeps very friendly.  The other customers, bunch of ole timers.  Gotta love the stories they tell, and banter back in forth.   You walked a stranger, but you leave there as family.
And the food is good too."}
{"text":"Good food, drinks are priced decently, super friendly staff.  We stop in at least once a week."}
{"text":"A great place for a Friday night fish dinner. The baked fish is my favorite.  The prices are very reasonable with good drink specials. The wait staff is very friendly. Ask for the hash browns with cheese and onions and you won't be disappointed.  They can accommodate large groups and are willing to make special orders.  Give them a try and you will walk away satisfied."}
{"text":"We stopped in one morning for breakfast and a few drinks before a Badger game. Breakfast was really good; I'd highly recommend the french toast. 
We came back later that night and had some more drinks and apps. Service was very friendly and the food was still good. Loved the open concept of the bar; it was nice not to bump into anyone when I needed a refill. 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We love Paul's! 

It is our go-to fish fry location! Go early, or you'll be waiting a bit. But it is worth every minute waiting. 

Their fish fry is all-you-can-eat deep-fried cod, baked cod or deep-fried perch. It is extremely reasonable for the area too! Your meal comes with a side and rolls beforehand. 

The baked cod will be the best you've ever had!


It's the only night that have servers on usually, so like I said, it can get busy."}
{"text":"All you can eat fish fry for $11.75! Of course Friday night. NICE Um yeah... lots of seating, TV's and Fish fry? you CANNOT beat it... This place is great! (Bit of a drive from downtown madison) but isnt that what Yelp is all about? Seriously, cheap food, cheap drinks. And PLENTY of it... plus this place has been around for quite a while! (longer than people might think)"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! There definitely isn't anything 'special' on tap here, but sometimes all you need is a PBR tallboy to quench your thirst! I don't come for the drinks anyway- the burgers are delicious! The local Knoche's beef and fluffy, buttery buns are SO GOOD. 
And this is the place to come for your no-frills all-you-can-eat Friday night fish fry! You're served a dinner roll, coleslaw and potato (I always order hashbrowns!) and a choice between fried cod or perch or baked cod. Do yourself a favor and order at least one round of the baked cod! It absolutely melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday in November and had a really great time; so, we decided to come back for the Saturday meat raffle.  What a disappointment.  Although service was slow (there was only 1 server for all of the tables - she was trying her best!), the raffle was running smoothly at first but then our table started being skipped multiple times for buying paddles.  When I politely inquired about it, all I got was attitude.  We ended up leaving for a different meat raffle, which turned out to be much more fair and organized!

We ordered a couple of apps (chicken strips and cheese curds) and we all thought they were yummy.  So the food is a thumbs up from what we had.

I would maybe come back to meet up with a   friend for a drink or something here and there, but unfortunately we won't be back for any meat raffles anytime soon."}
{"text":"After yesterday's burger disappointment I was craving a burger while I was in town so I started looking on Yelp and there was tons of chain/mall places which I didn't want because I wanted something local like a draft beer and a bar burger and I ended up at Paul's.

Pauls is a cool Wisconsin neighborhood bar that is a good size space with the bar, pool tables, game machines and so on in the front while the back is table and chairs for the dining area. There is plenty of flat screens with sports playing. It's not a complete dive but it's not bad, it's not nice like the old fashioned or places like that.

They actually had two servers working the room and mine was not as experienced as the other one because she came over to see if she was taking care of me and with that being said my service was not to bad.

Here we go again, I ask if I can gat a rare burger and I'm told that that would not be a problem. The menu is typical bar food and I will post a picture and they serve breakfast. I opted for the 1/3 pound bacon burger with lettuce, raw onion and tomato. 

The draft beer selection is border line it will do with a few offerings that were not the domestic but mostly domestic, I opted for the Wi Amber. My beer came quick and before I could snap some pictures and two sips from the beer my burger hit the table, has to be the fastest order to table I have ever experienced.

The bacon cheeseburger looked amazing and you could see how juicy the beef patty was so it was cooled to my liking, not cooked to dry well. I was impressed with how good this bar burger looked and the toppings were fresh with a thick slice of tomato, mound of thin sliced raw onions and the good lettuce because iceberg blows on a burger.

The burger was on a lightly toasted/buttered light/soft fresh bun. This was a juicy burger and became messy to eat. The bacon was hearty and stood up to every bite, not the soggy kind where the first bite pulls the whole strip out. I really liked how the cold thick mound of vegys contrasted with the warm meat and soft bun.

The reason I'm giving five stars is because this neighborhood bar puts out a burger that is cooked perfect and it will put most burger places to shame. This was a great quality burger which satisfied my crave so I would definitely recommend the burger here."}
{"text":"Pauls is a nice place to come to chill.  Cajun fries are alright, nothing to write home about.  Great drink prices.  Just waited 5 min for a drink, with 3 bartenders behind the bar.  But we got our drinks and have multiple tvs to watch only horse racing on."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 if I could. We went early because we didn't realize the fish wasn't served until 4:30. Service was a 5. The staff was very friendly and responsive. The fish fry was flakey and had good flavor if you like thin/light batter. I wouldn't say, \"it's the best in the area\" like other reviewers, but it's a good fish fry. I wouldn't wait over 15-20 min for it. You can add the salad bar for $1.00 which is nice. It was simple with iceberg lettuce and vegetables (and some Spinach) to put on top. I got hash browns with cheese and  onions for my potato side and they were good."}
{"text":"This place is so Wisconsin.  I was born and raised in Middleton and finally made it to this place 24 years later.  I recently moved to Chicago and came back to visit my parents for the holidays.  The food isn't much to write home about but the drinks are dirt cheap and the atmosphere is the friendliest around."}
{"text":"One of the best fish fry's in the area!  Great drinks and fun atmosphere.  The wait for a Friday fish fry can be a little much if you have young children but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Simple breakfast food menu. There was a lot of ole timers around the bar so you know this place had at least good service. The bar was nice, clean and spacious. The bathroom was surprisingly clean for a bar so thats a plus. They have a Friday Fish Fry buffet that I might come back for."}
{"text":"Average place.  Average food.  Fried stuff and fried burgers.  Loud.  Rowdy crowd for fish fry.  Much better places around... Unless you like average."}
{"text":"An up north kinda bar (say it in a Sconnie accent) in Middleton is the best explanation for Paul's.  The tell tale sign is that the door signage says: breakfast, lunch and fish fry - conveniently omitting dinner as an option without fish. Gaming machines, bar pools and dice, with pull tabs are the norm with a shot and a beer. 

The fish fry is the big draw at Paul's.  They have baked and fried cod or perch with an AYCE price of $12.50.  It's served with your choice of potato - baked, krinkle cut fries, or hashbrowns with cheese and/or onions, coleslaw and a roll.  The coleslaw was soupy and didn't draw my attention because it was drowning in sauce.  The rolls were ordinary supper club like without any flair so again I avoided.  

My table split the baked and fried cod.  I was told by my friends who are regulars to skip the butterfly shrimp because the size and taste isn't impressive.  The fried cod was breaded which is my preference; however, the breading lacked flavor and needed a dousing of salt to really make it taste decent. The baked cod definitely had more flavor but was a overdone because it was no longer flaky.  The fries were hit and miss on whether they were steaming hot or lukewarm. 

You are probably asking why I still gave this place three stars?  The up north charm and vibe sets this place apart.  Everyone else seemed to LOVE this place so maybe I have set the bar too high.  Also they let you take home your leftovers for an AYCE meal which is very odd.  Service tended to be a little slow because they were swamped.  However, the servers were very polite.

When I am back in Middleton I will give it another chance for their burgers and other menu items.  It is a gem of a place with such a north WI vibe that I can't resist the draw. Maybe next time I am there I can participate in a meat raffle!"}
{"text":"Went there with the intention of having lunch. Had one round with an order of mushrooms and left. Fairly obvious you have to be a regular to feel welcome. Bartenders were like talking to a brick wall. Bloody Mary took 10 minutes and Sucked.  The chaser was not my choice and half foam. Fried mushrooms were OK. Drink prices were reasonable. To many cool places in Middleton to go back."}
{"text":"Would normally give Pauls 4 stars,but have reduced it due to a recent customer service issue.I am a 'sorta regular' here. They have very good fish frys and equally tasty breakfasts [bacon is exceptional] ,along with generally friendly service...That  changed Sunday..Was here with companions .. Decided to play the \"'cherry master video machine\" during our visit..Got to a $50 credit when we HAD to leave...Asked Julie to just clear the machine as she was very busy,and I would return later for the money...Please keep in mind clearing machine involves pressing a button and one second of time. Reply was \"can't now\". Waited ten minutes as she walked by me 3 times..Finally told here again we needed to leave...She basically went into a public rant yelling to the bartender to \"give this guy $50\"...We just can not justify returning after this experience..Darn, cause it's generally a decent place..."}
{"text":"Pauls is still rocking it in Middleton.  In a city where restaurants come and go Pauls appears to be one that will be staying. My wife and I enjoy going here for a beer or wings. Sometimes it might even be carryout. We know we'll always get good service and good food here. 

The Buffalo Chicken Wings are huge and very tasty too! 

Keep up the stellar service!"}
{"text":"It delivers on the name. I stopped in after work for a drink and never tried the food but this is not my kind of place."}
{"text":"Delivers exactly what you would expect. Total Wisconsin atmosphere, good prices, quick and tasty food. Large seating area was a little under staffed and the waitresses were really busy,  but the breakfast was still quick and good. I would go out of my way to stop here again."}
{"text":"This definitely a local favorite, kinda divey fish fry place. Service was sub-par. My niece was with us and the hostess and server seemed so confused about the placement of the high chair at the table, like they'd never navigated around one when in reality there were like two being used right next to is. Our server also always seemed to be in a panicked rush despite the fact that they weren't crazy busy. 
This place gets 4 stars because the fish fry is amazing. It's all you can eat for $12.95, you can get baked cod, fried cod or fried perch. I went with the perch and baked potato for my choice of potato. It was such a good decision. 
I haven't had a Friday night in Wisconsin in quite some time so I was really wanting a good fish fry and Paul's did not disappoint. So good."}
{"text":"This place is perfectly quaint and has delicious food and perfectly reasonably priced drinks. Neighborhood bar is right. It's a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a local bar and not a fine dining restaurant, but they have a very friendly staff and serve a great Friday night all you can eat fish fry. If you can get past the noise level and the plain and simple accommodations, you will enjoy the food and the service."}
