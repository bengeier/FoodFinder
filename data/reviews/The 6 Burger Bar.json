{"text":"I love this place. Very high quality poutines (coming from a poutine fanatic who recently visited Montreal), and a great variety of comfort foods. The cheese curds really squeek! Their burgers are juicy and flavourful, and portions with all meals are generous and very satisfying. Perfect place to grab food before a night of drinking. There is a slight wait time, but quality food demands a little patience.

The business owner and head cook is a nice guy. I enjoyed speaking with him.

Finding a greasy spoon like this is much like treasure hunting: It's another Toronto gem hidden in a very discreet Scarborough neighborhood.

Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Poutines are out of this world good! Tried just about all the different kinds and they are all amazing! It's a great little spot in Scarborough, easy to get to and parking is available. However, definitely order ahead because regardless of what you order it will take a minimum of 20 minutes for it to be ready (worth the wait i promise!)"}
{"text":"My wife and I were trying to decide on what to have for lunch. A quick search on Yelp and we found this place. Don't be scared off by the location, this is a hidden little gem and we are so happy we found it!!
The poutine is great, could probably feed three people. 
Can't wait to try the other items on their menu, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Seems to be a small, family-owned place. They're really nice. The space is small so probably better for takeout. Menu is burgers and Greek fare. They ha e 5oz, 8oz or 12oz burgers, and they're very tasty. The sauce they put on Greek salads and souvlaki isn't Greek dressing (as far as I could tell). That's the only knock. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine who lives nearby told me to check this place out.  We went together & I had the large (8oz) burger. He had the 8oz Banquet burger with 2 fries & we split an onion rings.
Wow! Wow! Wow!

 - that's about it - Best Burger in the GTA.
Reasonably priced, Large portions.
Yes, there was a bit of a wait to get it prepped, but well worth the wait - will definitely go back again & again.
I thing we needed to get carried out in a wheelbarrel.
You must check it out."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. No idea it existed until being in the area and looking on yelp for a burger place.  The good reviews are bang on.  If you didn't know about this place you would walk by. Reminded me of the burger joints we had when I was a teenager. A one man show, cook, cashier and great guy behind the counter. 
We ordered the 5oz cheese burger and onion rings. Great taste, more than enough to eat.
The owner was very nice. This place is a local gem.
Excellent food, huge portions, great service, good prices, what more could you ask for"}
{"text":"Best Fish & Chips I've had in ages. Enormous portions, moist flaky haddock in a delicious crispy batter."}
{"text":"Fresh made fries and burger made to order. No frills. I'm a sucker for fake cheese sauce out of the machine. Friendly guy."}
{"text":"I visited this place from out of town after going to the new Costco ( and a few other supplies).
I live in Kingston and do not like too go to the overpriced Onroutes along the 401.  After doing an online recee  of what to eat I decided to try this place.  I had the steak sandwich.  The sandwich was real steak and not the minute steak crap.    It was excellent.  As the steak was too big for the bun it did get messy. But that's Ok. Some of my favorites food can be a mess.
As for some people commenting that it took too long.   It was made fresh. You want fast  go to McDonalds. You want fresh and hot  that have a wait . I will return next time I am in the area"}
{"text":"The poutines here put smokes poutines to shame. Real squeaky cheese curds, and loaded with ingredients.

Everything else on the menu is also great. I don't think I've had something here I didn't like."}
{"text":"I came here based on the reviews and also because I recently came back Montreal so I was super craving poutine. Hate to be the one who pulls down the ratings, but the wait times here are unforgivable. Unfortunately, when we got here, the main cook was flying solo while his partner was at the back practicing how to construct and reconstruct a salad. No joke. I wasn't sure if he really was practicing or if he was making it for a customer. While their menu looks attractive & appetizing, it's overwhelming in that they have wayy too many menu items which in turn plays as one of the downfalls of this joint.

Although honest and one of the friendliest guys you will meet, this dude can only work on one order at a time and cannot multitask. My bf and I walked in to order a poutine each; there were 4 people ahead of us, plus he had to take phone orders and check his online orders. Long story short, we walked in at 6pm and left at 7pm - one HOUR of waiting! At least he's honest to his incoming customers, straight out tells them that he's running behind schedule; that there will be a one hour wait. However, his (loyal and seemingly regular) customers didn't seem to mind, and they continued to stay (mostly arriving online customers who then found out there's another hour wait for their take-out). Thankfully, there's a TV to keep us entertained for a short while. There's poor ventilation in the shop, so between breathing in grease and watching him handle food and money without any gloves or handwashing, I had to step out for a breather. 

FOOD: but finally, about the food. After waiting so long no doubt I was hungry. Maybe that's the strategy? The poutine was large, it's a Wow size at Smoke's Poutinerie. I'm pretty happy with it because it served as two meals for me lol. Even my boyfriend couldn't finish his and no doubt we were hungry. Their fries are frozen, twice fried (because they got cold), but in my hungry state I couldn't taste anything wrong with them. The cheese curds, (not squeaky), but yummy! The gravy is good but gets a little salty at the end. He threw in a cup of taco cheese sauce for us for being patient customers. Would I come back again? Only if I were in the area so I can try their extensive list of poutines, and burgers too. But maybe after a few months when they establish their efficiency. This place has potential. Their menu design and website are solid. I would give this place another chance. 

A TIP to the owner (if u ever read this): stick with burgers & fries (since that's the name of the shop) and maybe keep the ice cream, but cut out the rest so you can focus your inventory and increase service speed. I understand that freshness is key, but if people are coming in, they're gonna be ordering burgers & fries (cuz it'll be the only thing on your menu!). It wouldn't hurt to keep 2-3 patties and a batch of fries going so that service is ready. You need a better way of jotting down orders so you have an organized way to see how many servings of patties & fries you need to throw on the grill/fryer, and I guess sorting them by walk-in and online. I really hope you can get your service speed up to par, you have a really nice joint, make it a hidden gem worthy of its name!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall, greasy burger joint with the warmest staff. Portions are HUGE! The place is super narrow but fits a number of tables for two. 

WE ORDERED:
Steak in a kaiser - certified angus beef steaks are cut in house. It came with caramelized onions, bell peppers and cheese; it's a sandwich that you can really sink your teeth into. You can get the HP steak sauce on the sandwich or on the side.

Banquet burger - comes with peameal or strip bacon, it was ok.

French Fries and Onion Rings - greasy but crunchy and tasty. Plus points for having malt vinegar for the fries. 

Beware of using the washroom in the basement. As the owner describes it: it's a little \"American Horror Story\", you'll understand when you check out my pictures. 

Wouldn't recommend coming during rush hours because there's only one cook who also doubles as the cashier; yes, he's fastidious about washing his hands. Regulars either call in their order; or place their order and leave and come back when it's done. 

Want to come back to try their HUMONGOUS The 6 Burger with a one pound burger in between a waffle bun with half a pound of bacon, cheese and onion rings; hubby's definitely gonna have to share this with me. Other interesting things they put on their burgers are mac n cheese, gyro meat, pulled pork, an egg, hotdog and poutine; you can even choose french toast or grilled cheese sandwiches as  buns!"}
{"text":"Small Neighborhood place (in Plaza on Birchmount Road before Eglinton )  with lots of things to eat. Family owned. Take out spot. I've liked everything I've tried. From the sweet potato fry pulled pork poutine  ..to blt breakfast sandwich  ..Greek salad..homeburger...good value good price.  Friendly staff. Small,Not for eat in but does have couple stools just in case you are passing by. They just added ice cream. ..just in time for the warm weather. Yum."}
{"text":"My favourite spot !! Steve is a fantastic !! The food is the best I've had !! This spot is an absolute gem !!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 3pm so I was the only one there. The guys were sitting outside enjoying the weather but jumped inside immediately when I said I was looking for a gyro covered in gravy. 

Good Lord it was good. It was my first encounter with poutine in Canada and I almost died (not just because Trump was on TV praising the Pittsburgh penguins and slamming NAFTA or because of the 10k calories in this thing).  It was delicious and, after telling them I was in the area for a few days I walked out of the restaurant with a handwritten map and list of places to see. 

I'm terrible with names so I can't remember who I spoke with but it was an awesome experience and highly recommended."}
{"text":"This review is only based on my order of pork souvlaki dinner. The pork was a bit on the dry side since they took it out of the fridge and put it on the grill without adding anything. The rice with potatoes and garlic bread were delicious though. I don't even like Greek food that much but I am still giving this place 5 stars because I was just amazed by the generous portion sizes and the overall quality of the food. Be prepared to wait awhile for your food because this place is pretty busy. The popularity of this restaurant should speak volumes on how good the food actually is.

If I didn't live so far away, I would be eating here at least once every two weeks because this place is THAT good.

There is very limited seating (3-4 seats?) inside as it is primarily a take-out joint."}
