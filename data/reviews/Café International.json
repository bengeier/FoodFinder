{"text":"Have gone to Café International about 4 or 5 times in the past 10 years.  I always enjoy the decor and ambiance.  The comfortable seating with multiple large screen tvs make this place pleasant to be in.  In Summer, their outside terrace in the little Italy part of St-Laurent street is great for people watching.

In past visits the food has been hit or miss.  A consistent hit used to be the coffee, the calamari salad and the service.  A recent visit, in July of 2011, left me disappointed as neither the calamari salad nor the service was up to par. I didn't have any coffee as the service was so slow and inept I just wanted to leave asap.
The calamari salad had a fraction of the calamari they used to put in and it seemed they forgot to put the lime juice in the dressing which made the dish very bland.
We also tried the fried calamari  and the tomato and buffalo cheese pizza for the first time.  Although it wasn't bad the batter on the calamari tasted like Kentucky Fried Chicken batter.  The portion was generous.
The pizza crust was thin and tasteless. The tomato sauce was ok but very runny (there was a puddle of liquid in the plate half way through.  The buffalo cheese tasted so bland it was hard to tell it was buffalo at all.

Overall not a satisfactory experience, specially not for the price they charged.  You can do better only one or two doors down for the same price. I would not recommend Café International any longer."}
{"text":"Have gone a few times over the years, mainly because its a convenient place to pop in while strolling in Little Italy, and I've always left feeling like something was missing...or off... from the dining experience. 

A lunch time pit stop with a girl friend left us staring at our bill in amazement (2 panninis and 2 lemonades rang in at over 50$ with tax and tip!) We both had the prosciutto-mozzarella-red pepper pannini which wasn't bad but certainly not worth the price. It was stingy on prosciutto and the mozzarella was a little rubbery. Its fine quality for a quick, cheap bite but at that price, I expect better. 

Service wasn't terrible and certainly courteous but not particularly attentive. Although our waitresswas suddenly much more attentive when our very attractive male friend stopped by our table!  Pet peeve - our waitress replied in French when we attempted to speak English. 

A quick dinner stop last Friday wasn't much different. We had the margherita pizza and sausage pizza and neither were showstoppers. The crust was very thin and well cooked(plus!) but both the cheese and sausage tasted very pre-packaged and neither pizza arrived particularly hot. 

Service was better - our waitress was bilingual and took time taking our orders and offering up clarifications (maybe because we were joined by abovementioned attractive male friend?) Although when I asked for San Pellegrino lemonade, I was brought a random brand of sparkling water...

Restaurant itself is clean and spacious with comfortable seating and large screens which permitted us to watch hockey highlights."}
{"text":"Un peu desappointé par la pizza de la semaine de la pizza : 1) elle est au menu 2) elle est au prix du menu et est somme toute assez ordinaire."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot for Business meetings in Little Italy.  The space is well Decorated and quaint; It is very busy spot with professionals and local celebrities.  

The starters: calamari, beef tartare and tomato vegetable soup were amazing

Pastas:  our table had gnocchi, spaghetti bolognese, fettuccini carbonara with a side of flame grilled chicken breast and the fish of the day with vegetables; all tasted fresh and looked visually very appealing.  It was apparent that the pasta was made from scratch, on site: the sign of an authentic Italian craft and not the jersey-Italian chain attempts.  Everything tasted amazing, very good Café International!  We Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place during our first trip to Montreal. Cute little place, good service, and yummy food! We got the lasagna, pasta, and bruschetta. I would recommend it as a great stop in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"I remember going a couple of times, 
it unfortunately appears to be closed.

Their coffee is divine and their pasta is amazing.
The best spot for people watching in Little Italy (IMO)

Can't really explain their demise other than St-Laurent is really struggling these days."}
{"text":"Très bien pour un latté et catcher le bourdonnement de la rue St-Laurent en plein coeur de la Petite Italie."}
{"text":"Very good Italian spot with very authentic pasta, pizza and other bites. The pasta and pizza are made fresh and by hand! It's never super crowded, so I can always get a table, and the prices are quite reasonable. 

There is one waitress who could use some lessons in manners, but it doesn't detract so much from the awesome food."}
{"text":"Une des bonnes adresses pour la pizza croute mince. Avec mon copain, nous avons pu demander un plat hors menu : Risotto extra saucisses à l'italienne. Très satisfaisant selon ses dires. Le fondant au chocolat a bien terminé le festin. Un peu cher à mon goût : Calmars frits à 17$, mais tout de même délicieux!
Services courtois, ambiance chaleureuse, familles italiennes aux alentours. Une valeur sûre, a mon avis."}
{"text":"If you're in Little Italy, it'a decent place to have lunch. The menu is not amazing, but the daily specials are usually very good. The focaccia is exceptionnal. 

I would not go for supper because of the limited menu and the ambiance. 

The service is good... sometimes a little slow, but polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Great pasta (as good as napolitana), I had the wild mushroom pappardelle. They have a short list of pizza and pasta but all the necessary is there. Good wine at a good price. Plus no waiting to get a table. I'll be back!"}
