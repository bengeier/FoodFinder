{"text":"I used to be a fan of this place until we won some 'coupons' through a fun fair at my son's school. We were entitled to three large single topping pizzas if we showed the cards we won. The first coupon we left with our babysitters so that they could order a pizza for them and our son. The delivery guy pretty well gave them sh*t for giving him a coupon, even though I had left tip money. The next time I called up and said I had a coupon so there would be  no surprises. When I have him my address, the guy on the phone says:' Oh, you. You tried this before.' ...like I was trying to scam them with a coupon THEY had issued in a fit of 'public spirit'. 
Unbelievable. 
The other interesting thing about their attitude is that a Pizza Hut franchise opened up about 5 or 6 doors down from them. You'd think with that kind of scary competition, they'd want to hold on to local customers.
I will say their food is decent,  but for us, not good enough to transend  the shabby treatment we experienced during the 'coupon fiasco'."}
{"text":"Stopped by last night and grabbed a couple of veal sandwiches.  One thing to note, the guy in front of me ordered a \"sweet veal\" sandwich.  I then asked the guy at the counter how the sandwich worked and if all of the topping were extra.  He told me you get the veal and sauce for the basic sandwich and other toppings were extra.  I then asked what \"sweat veal\" meant and he said that was without hot peppers.  There is also \"medium veal\" and \"hot veal\".  So, I am not sure what happens if you just order a \"veal sandwich\" but if you don't like hot peppers be sure to clarify!  I got a medium and it was spicey enough for me.

Lastly, they didn't include napkins in the bag.  The guy asked the customer in front of me if he wanted napkins but I don't know why he didn't ask me or include them in the bag.

Overall, I will probably never be in that area again but I would order again if there."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best San Francesco's. The atmosphere is great. Always showing sports on the TVs.  The Ponzo's are definitely the best in town, pizzas are great.. honestly all the food is amazing here! The staff are friendly, and the prices are beyond fair"}
{"text":"Independent. Delicious, and been here so long it was only $2 for a slice & pop when it first opened... Now it's still only $3.50, which is still a solid deal. 

Go to watch the game and enjoy there classic menu, including amazing sandwiches and wings. 

Not much more to be said, other than you should eat here too."}
{"text":"As you step into San Francesco, it looks like they only offer take-out but what's hidden behind is a big room with tables and chairs, and even a small bar beside the kitchen. It was dimly lit with flat-screen TVs playing the Blue Jays' game live.

My boyfriend and I ordered a steak sandwich combo with Caesar salad and a can of pop for around $12, and 12 wings at 50 cents each (minimum order of 12). 

The sandwich was big, meaty and juicy with onions as the only topping (included). We had asked for medium level of spiciness and surprisingly, it was a little too spicy for my liking. 

The salad was fresh. It's not often that we get what we pay for when it comes to a salad, but this salad was big and full of bacon bits. It was well-covered in dressing as well, which is just the way I like my Caesar salads.

As for the wings...at 50 cents each, we did not expect very much. But when our 12 wings arrived at our table on a big plate, we were still surprised to see how tiny they were. They must have been quail wings! Despite the size, my boyfriend and I enjoyed them because they were nice and crispy. You can order mild or medium wings, but my boyfriend asked for dry wings so the server just added a bit of salt and pepper over them.

I'm not a big fan of dimly-lit restaurants (and watching sports, really), but since they offer take-out, we'll definitely be back to try their veal sandwich, pizza, and panzerotti."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible pizza. Paid $23 for a party size pizza. Basic pizza is just sauce and cheese. Each extra topping is $2 extra and as you can see in the picture they did a half-assed job of dressing the pizza - the centre wasn't even covered and the bottom right was only partially covered. The ingredients used are  substandard. The crust was puffy like sandwich bread and the cheese was gross and gummy. Felt sick all night after eating this garbage."}
{"text":"Very nice people working there!  Ordered the steak sandwich and the meat portion was very generous.  I was able to see them prepare my food which is always nice to see.  Will definitely come for another steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza, the cheese was like chewing gum and the sauce had a flat taste to it, would never order pizza here again. Cant judge their other food as I've only ordered pizza here on two occasions figuring the second time might be better."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing Food!!  I've been coming to this location for years!! I HIGHLY recommend the deep fried or baked Panzo's. The Veal Sandwich is also sooo delicious your mouth will be watering for days after eating it. The pizza slices are Super Big also very affordable for such high quality. Long Live San Fran!! I am definitely a lifer!!"}
{"text":"Amazing veal sandwich. Great pizza. Tasty wings. All fresh. Cooked to order. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Wow. 

The food here is awesome. 

I've had the panzerrotti - which is as big as your head!  I've also had the sandwiches. 

The meatball sandwich is perfectly prepared - with a wonderful tomato sauce in your preferred level of hotness. 

Definitely a must-try local favorite."}
{"text":"Inexpensive,  clean,  friendly staff and great food.   Sandwiches and Panzo are huge and made to order fresh.   I have had the steak and the meatball sandwiches and they are on a very nice bun with home made toppings.   Grab a pint to go with your lunch if you are eating in."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious! The one thing I can say for sure is they give you a generous helping on the meat. 

I used to be a veal sandwich aficionado at this location, but I've recently tried the steak sandwiches and I actually like them better! It's a healthier option (marginally ...)

The steak sandwich is $8.00 taxes in and comes with onions and peppers! I used to get it medium or hot, but recently tried it sweet and the sweet peppers pair really well and don't over-rule the sweet tomato sauce like the hot peppers - I highly suggest you try it!

Steak is well-seasoned and the kaiser bun is pretty big all things considered. I frequent this place simply for their quantity.

Customer service is not the best, but for $8.00 it can be overlooked.

Call ahead for the steak sandwiches as they do take a bit longer to cook!

I love their food!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to eat a big sandwich or some pizza in. This is my place when I want a veal or steak sandwich, always tender and flakey, fresh salad and ingredients. Also has LLBO so you can wash it all down with a pint."}
{"text":"Not sure how reviewers can claim this place has delicious food... really? Deep fried low grade veal with synthetic mozza is delicious? Unkneaded extra doughy soggy pizza crust is your culinary delight? Wtf?add the crap attitude with the people working there and this place is horrible.  Im talking about the location off of winston churchill. The other location uses better quality food.."}
{"text":"When you crave a nice meaty steak sandwich, nobody does it better.

Seriously, you pay your money, but you get your value...

I have never visited during a game or a sports night, but the few weekends I have gone for take-out, their service is fast and friendly, and they have BRIO!!!!

I've done both walk-in takeout as well as pre-order takeout and both have been great experiences.  The food is always ready in short order, and always hot.  

Everytime I eat these sandwiches, they pack so much meat and filling into it that it invariably falls apart and drips onto my hands, and I love the mess.  And when you ask to make it \"spicy, with a kick\" they really do. 

Definitely a must-try-at-least-once steak sandwich joint."}
{"text":"Just wandering around to get food and found this place. Their signature panzarotti is so good and chessy. Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"We have regulars since we moved in to the neighbourhood last year. Great food, good prices, always friendly service in person and on the phone.
Have had panzos (huge), salads, pizza, chicken sandwiches, penne and  ravioli. All great!"}
{"text":"I think a lot of the reviews must be for take out pizza because in-store experience is dreadful. At 630pm i arrive for this delicious food and I'm greeted by the pizza baker. I wanted an entree and he had no idea what to recommend.  I order lasagne and caesar salad. Lasagna is only ok. The sauce is only ok. Not that flavourful. Can't  taste garlic or meat sauce or anything distinctive.  The caesar salad has imitation bacon bits!!! I finish my lasagne and bring my untouched caesar salad back to the till.  The waitress / manager asks whats the matter with the salad.  I give my perspective that a pizza joint that offers bacon as a topping should be able to offer real bacon on a salad. \"This isnt fine dining, sir.\"  --- Can you hear that? That's sarcasm.  And I was still charged for the salad."}
{"text":"This place is great. Slice and a coke for $3 or a veal, salad & coke for $8. Pizza is good but no delivery. Staff is great and service is quick unless they're really busy."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite veal sandwich shop in the entire GTA!!! Everything about this sandwich is amazing. The veal is cook perfectly, the sauces is tasty, and the toppings are delicious (especially the roasted red peppers). This is a take-out spot, or stand and eat. I come here a lot with people from work, and everyone loves the sandwiches here. I haven't tried that many items on the menu... the pepperoni pizza and the veal sandwich. The pizza is good, but it is not what is going to bring you back to this spot. If you like veal sandwiches, your going to love this place. I like to wash my sandwich down with a cold Brio.

Other thing to mention here is that the staff is fast and friendly, and this place only accepts cash, so hit the ATM before coming."}
{"text":"Just as I remembered it as a kid.  Veal sandwich was saucy and tender.  Really liked the roasted peppers and mushroom. And got two thumbs up and a good devour from my 10 year old for the pepperoni pizza.

I took it home so I could have with wine... delish!"}
{"text":"Being born and raised in the Dufferin/Lawrence area in Toronto 
Where the competition of Italian Bakerys fuels each to differentiate with the upmost quality, one becomes accustomed to a certain standard of Italian Fast food.

And with the scarcity of Italian Bakerys with Hot Tables in Mississauga, where more Pizza stores are owned by Indians than Italians, one would not expect the same quality of products being delivered than from their \"Middle Italy\" counterparts.

However, San Francesco foods on Britannia Rd, proves otherwise. Having stumbled upon this location almost a year ago I have become a regular patron, feeling as if I will committ a sin should I drive by the location without at least picking up a slice of their thin crust sicilian style pizza. Another favorite is their Veal/Chicken Sandwiches which they layer and stuff with inches full of meat, topping it with their savoury home cooked authentic Italian sauce which is flavorful yet not Ragu-out-of-a-can-thick.

Their prized offering however, which I cant tell how much of my money it owns, is their Panzerotti. The Panzo which is about $10 is completely loaded with what tastes like almost a half pound of Mozzarella cheese, and more Pepperonis than a Large pizza from Pizza Pizza - seriously it is stuffed. Their home cooked sauce is the perfect complement to the deep fried yet light dough shell which is fried exactly right, where it is golden crispy on the outside and the cheese is melted to the perfect point inside.

Overall it is probably in my top 3 Italian Fast Food places in Toronto - and their Panzo is probably #1 in the city."}
{"text":"have a hit steak and a beer and stay awhile . only this san farn is good the others suck tgey are the kings of hot steak also great olives"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great, but most important is that this place has the best pizza in town.  One of the very best I've ever had anywhere.  Many times I've gone there thinking I should really try one of their pasta dishes, only to give in and order another pizza, deciding that maybe next time I'll try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I have ordered from this location numerous times and today I had the worst experience ever. It was the last straw.

Most of the time when I order they forget minor things or miss apart of the order and can be easily resolved, depending on who is on the shift I guess.

Today however I ordered lunch for a co-work and myself, the lasagnas meal (comes with a side and a drink), and both orders were under-cooked. I have never been so disappointed. The food came in boxed containers so of course sauce was all over the place, but I moved passed it tell my co-worker the food is worth it.

I was so very wrong. The lasagna was under-cooked, very doughy, cold in the center and watery. I tried putting in the microwave for 2 mins, but that didn't help it was that under cooked.

I called the store and spoke with them. The lady on the other end said it was impossible as they cook it for 45 minutes and than its on a hot plate. Apparently she herself tried it and she thinks its fine. (Please keep in mind I have ordered the lasagna from them before so I know what cooked lasagna is).

She continue to argued with me and than said if I want a refund or replacement I should just come in after 5pm and speak with the owners. Needless to say this is the worst customer service I have ever had to deal with. I would rather have been on the phone with a phone company.

I will not be ordered for this location again. I would rather driver the extra minutes to their other location on Clayhill. 

I wish my photos could do it justice but doesn't show the full effect. I will post them so you can at least get an idea.

Sadly this location is a fail."}
{"text":"The best steak sandwich I've had in Toronto' maybe anywhere. AFAIK this San Francesco's is owned by the original proprietor that seeded/sold the numerous San Francesco's throughout the Gta.

Steak is thinly sliced, cooked fresh on the flattop and mixed with sweet cartelized onions and their secret sauce, think sweet delicious rich drippings. 2 options, hot or sweet, put on a super fresh kaiser that has a buttery crust, almost kaiser brioche.

It's pure magic, impossible to share.
I would change noting about the sandwich, if you're still hungry, the pizza is nearly as good. Fresh light crust, homemade sauce, quality toppings, really, really good. Pics to come next time.

Bottom line.
If you like Italian style steak sandwiches and think you've found the best in Toronto, try sanfrans and bump that other sandwich to number 2."}
{"text":"2 words. VEAL SANDWICH!


Edit....
Yelp wouldn't let me review with 2 words because it was too short. 
The veal sandwich is awesome."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years because it's so close to home.   I love trying veal sandwiches all over the GTA,  and I must say this one is one the better veal sandwiches I have tried,  and the price is definitely lower then average, including price of toppings and stuff.  Staff if great, fast and friendly. I would definitely give this place out if your in the area and like authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Great food and inexpensive, I loved the Panzo's and pizza was amazing too, typical traditional Italian the way I like it."}
{"text":"It the kind of place you walk into and just ask what their specialty is. The answer. Everyone orders the veal. So veal sandwich it is and it was part of a special dinner meal. Got a brio (always a good sign when they have brio). After getting to my destination I opened the bag to find this huge sandwich on a fresh roll and took a big bite. First bite was amazing and I was very thankful I opted for a fifty cent addition of peppers. Somehow I finished the whole sandwich and still had room for a few fries. 

This little restaurant also has some seating and screens to enjoy these masterpieces fresh. Next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! the Veal is really good there pizza is good too. I give a slight edge to california sandwiches but this place is very close and is 2nd best in the city. More of a selection then california's also great quality."}
{"text":"Holy hell! This place is so easy to miss if you're never in the plaza on Douguy and Britannia, but you'd be sorry if you did! The food is fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Their steak sandwich is delicious, lots of meat and the softest bread ever. My kid ordered a plain old plate of penne and tomato sauce, and he almost licked the plate.  So good! The fried panzerotti is so good, add a little Frank's red hot and you're in heaven."}
{"text":"San Francesco Foods on Clayhill has been a staple in the neighborhood for years. 

Whether you get a panzo, or a sandwich you will be happy with your meal.

The staff is always friendly.

The panzo is filled with mounds of cheese, and their sauce is to die for. 

My go to order is a Panzo fried, with meatballs, pepperoni and chilli flakes.

The panzos baked are also really good. 

Favourite sandwich, steak with onions and cheese."}
{"text":"it was a decent pazarotti, but a bit overdone this time.  The pizza was spot on though, so i look forward to the next visit or delivery."}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza with 3 toppings. $18 

We really wanted to like it but after a few bites, you feel tired of chewing. It was too much dough, not enough sauce, and the sauce want that tasty.  So after eating one piece, you didn't really want to eat another.

We previously had the pizza at Michaelangelos Italian Food and that was the best pizza ever. So every pizza we have now would be compared to Michaelangelos. 

Sadly San Fran's pizza was not better. It's slightly better than Pizza Pizza."}
{"text":"Went with family last Saturday as kids wanted to have pizza. Decided rather than go to the normal national chains go to SF. Ordered a large pizza with three topping special, a veg sandwich and a bowl of spicy olives 
The jumbo olives were good and with a nice kick to it. The pizza was great. Not short changed on the toppings. The crust needs a little work - bit dry. If it was thinner it would have been perfect. The veg sandwich had green peppers, tomatoes mushrooms, cheese and some tomato sauce and a jalapeño. 
The sandwich was for my spouse bit the first bite she ate she got the jalapeño which was SPICY. She could not handle it and I took over and devoured it. 
The inside is too dark and needs some upgrade. The service was good. Prices reasonable and food was fresh. Better than the chains. Would go back again for sure"}
{"text":"Not quite the old California Sandwiches that used to be down on Queen street (wow, that actually might be showing my age...) but still very good.......

Talking about the veal sandwich of course, few things say summer like a veal sandwich to-go, enjoyed under al fresco the sun....and an ice-cold Brio to wash it all down...."}
{"text":"This place is so hit & miss, you never know what and when you will get your order. It's been 44 minutes and still waiting for a take out pizza.

I've been here before and it has never been this slow. Looks like the same staff but I have no idea what's going on in the kitchen.

I left and went for Indian instead.

A meal later and I am back for that pickup pizza. What? Still not ready? You've got to be kidding!

It took an hour to get a take out pizza! 

The worst part was the very RUDE woman who said I should call ahead of time! Excellent idea. I will call ahead next time but for delved and NOT from San Francesco!

On another occasion the crust was so burnt, not even the dogs would touch it"}
{"text":"I've been for a dozen late 1pm lunches as I like to avoid lunch rushes in general. The service is great these times.

I find it hard to get quick lasagna this side of town. Theirs has everything I crave, plenty of tasty sauce and cheese with perfectly cooked layers. And it's been consistent every time, unlike another reviewer's experience.

Yeah, the bacon on my caesar salad was lame bacon bits. So I make note to ask for no bacon, and that made it a salad worth the cost haha.

The panzerotti was good, and you get your money's worth with the size of it, but it's quite a lot of cheese in there!"}
{"text":"Veal sandwich Caesar salad and a soda for $12 Veal sandwich was great with long hots and cheese."}
{"text":"This is a great place because they make their food fresh!!! I've tried the huge panzerrottis and the lasagna.  The tomato sauce is fantastic!  They have television broadcasting sports and they also serve beer."}
{"text":"In my opinion, one of the better veal sandwiches in the city.  Order with mushsrooms and peppers and you''re good! They also make a really good calzone. The pepperoni squares are great as well, a little on the greasy side but that's why you order a cold Brio!"}
{"text":"I've given this place a few more chances and my experiences have been better.  Staff have been friendlier on repeat visits and I think their steak sandwich is damn solid and their prices are good. 

I've also had their pepperoni pizza with the roasted jalapeños and it was great if you like a spicy pie. 

Could still use a reno in the back room to make it more appealing as a bar.  Now having lived back in the area for awhile I appreciate it as a local spot to pick up a lunch."}
{"text":"Veal on a bun!!! It's not loaded with tomato sauce so if you like it messy this isn't it but if you like it clean get one from here.  The bread is soft, veal is soft and crispy.  Ask for hot and it's just right, makes you sweat but doesn't make your mouth numb.  I prefer a cleaner veal on a bun than messy so this was perfect for me."}
{"text":"Calzones were huge and had lots of pepperoni and cheese, lots of seating in this place."}
{"text":"Might be my favourite place to eat!  Veal sandwiches are always well cooked and huge,same with their delicious fries and caesar salads!  For $10 you get a full combo that you won't be able to finish!  Hard to find this place as their is no advertising and it's tucked away in this tiny plaza that has poor signage.  Once you go in there is an old school bar eating area which ads to the character of the place."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times. I always get their lunch combo. Sandwich, side, and pop.  It is a huge sandwich and a pretty good deal(~$10). Favourite so far is the eggplant parmesan. I sometimes add sautéed onions to it.
Service is always fast and friendly. 
The have TVs that play sports sometimes, but I'm usually there for lunch."}
{"text":"Had the steak sandwich and salad combo all I have to say is by far the best steak sandwich in town bar none ..it was juicy tender and loaded with flavour"}
{"text":"Just had there Veal Sangweeech.....
Totally Amazing , very tasty and great size .
Sauce was fantastic as was the bun . Very fresh.
There's actually a place to sit inside if you desire ,
Nothing to fancy but great to grab a bite and catch a game on the TV."}
{"text":"Really good steak sandwiches. Even the chicken one was pretty damn good too.  Kinda grubby place don't expect any gourmet sandwiches lol they're nothing  super  special but still good and cheap  sometimes that's all you want lol"}
{"text":"This place has been amazing ever since I remember! Can't really find any complains to be honest. My go to order is the steak sandwich combo with a Caesar salad! Sooooo good! Their pizza/panzerottis are also amazing! Cool atmosphere as well highly recommend this place! Best location out of the 2/3 that there is!"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak sandwich with fries and a brio. The steak was a bit dry to be honest, even if it was slathered in that marinara. The bread was alright and the fries had no seasoning! 

I will be giving this place another try sometime soon though. I want to love it, the people behind the counter seem nice :)"}
{"text":"Seeing these many high reviews online for San Franceso so i just had to try it. Even though I ordered from Skip the Dishes so i can only comment on the food.  

I ordered a party pizza, Mild olives and a
Caeser salad. I will say that the olives were a bit too salty nobody wanted to eat it. The caeser was so basic and dry not worth the money even though their prices were cheaper then other places. I will say that the party pizza was so tasty and fresh...its 16 Hugeee slices or they give you the option to cut into 32 slices. Definately worth it. I will say that all the items i bought the portion sizes and prices were great. I do look forward to trying out their other items."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!! The food is incredible, and the people are amazing. I ordered the veal sandwich and it's perfect. If you are looking for good food and a reasonable price, this is it. I'm coming back tomorrow"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the veal sandwich and basic cheese/pepperoni panzerotti here! The veal is tender and flavourful with just the right amount of sauce in a soft ciabatta bun. The panzerotti was also cheesy and packed with pepperoni, though it was more in the middle. The homemade marinara sauce that comes on the side with the panzerotti was delicious too! Prices were reasonable (about $7 for each of these, plus tax) for the quality that you get!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times but I really like this place. They have great sandwiches, my favourite ones in particular are the meatball and sausage. I've also tried the steak but it was not my favourite (but still good!). They also have pasta/pizza which is good as well. I don't really have anything bad to say about this place, the people are always friendly and the prices are really cheap! Especially for what you get! If you need to get a quick italian home comfort food fix, this is a nice spot! And if you're to lazy to go there, they also deliver. I still need to try some other things off the menu, so i'll definitely be coming back! Would I recommend this place? Yes!! I really don't think you'll be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"The veal sandwich was okay, but not as good sauce, meat, or toppings as California Sandwiches. The bread and butter that came with out pasta had no butter. And we had to pay $3 for a different pasta sauce other than tomato, and $3 to add 2 meatballs to the pasta...which is fine, but the meatballs were inedible. They must have been frozen and stale because half of them were so hard that we couldn't even bite through them. I've never in my life experienced that at a restaurant before. It wasn't even the taste...we literally bought meatballs we COULDN'T eat. I would have rather bought plastic fake meatballs so I could display them somewhere in the house at least."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5, based on the Chicken Sandwich

I cannot speak about the pizza or pasta, but this sandwich shop is in a really convenient location for me.  I stopped in 'cause I was pressed for time, had to grab a quick dinner, & didn't want Subway/McD's in the plaza.

I asked the girl taking the orders about which was better, either the Panzarotti OR 1 of the sanwiches.  She answered sandwiches and suggested the Chicken.  Chicken was in a schnitzel format, flattened, breaded, & deep fried - actually quite similar to a veal sandwich!

Only 1 size of sandwich here and they were quite substantial, cut in half in which I only ate half for dinner, all for $7.  Cheaper than On-A-Bun.  A slew of toppings (cheese, mushrooms, peppers, etc.) were ALL included for an additional $1.  Not bad if you feel as though you need these additional things.

Hot green peppers were added as I wanted it spicy.  Very good, especially when it's eaten fresh!

No nonsense sandwich place, hopefully healthier than McD's??  ;)"}
{"text":"Just another veal sandwich place that has the College and Grace,dimly lit motif, down right at least."}
{"text":"The best veal sandwich in the city. No seriously! It's the sauce. You can get it with just meat and sauce, but I recommend a hot with the works. A small menu but when you got it right, you got it right. You don't have to go home... you just can't stay here. There's nowhere to eat."}
{"text":"Veal sandwiches are delicious with fantastic sauce. Get a slice of the fried eggplant in it. Never disappoints. Love love love their Greek salad. Has lots of feta cheese tasty olives. Also serves alcohol which is fantastic when you are craving some wine or beer with your panzos or sandwiches."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem! My friends and I had the cheese cannelloni and panzarotti and it was the best! Definitely will go back for it again!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and stopped by here to grab a quick bite. Read the reviews how the steak sandwich was a must try. 
The steak sandwich ($8) was massive! Packed with meat. You have the option of choose sweet, medium or hot. I went with medium - it was a little spicy since they added hot peppers under the steak layers. There is a small layer of sweet tomato sauce, which I felt wasn't enough. Could have used a bit more sauce as the meat tasted slightly dry and the spiciness overpowered the flavor of the sauce. Loved the caramelized onions stuffed in at the bottom of the sandwich."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a colleague of mine so I decided to go it a try.  I ordered the steak sandwich with all toppings which included , mushrooms, cheese, green peppers and jalapenos and a slice of pepperoni pizza. The service was pretty good, they were fast and efficient.  Once I saw my sandwich that they were putting together for me, I was blown away at the size.  It was really big and stacked with a lot of meat and was heavily poured with their special sauce. Lots of meat and sauce is always good right? Well not really because when I ate it at my office which was a 12 min drive away, the special sauce that they poured into the sandwich made the sandwich itself super soggy! So soggy that it disintegrated the Kaiser bun so much that I had to eat the sandwich with a fork picking up the meat and toppings.  It was probably my fault for not eating it at the restaurant but I've had similar sandwiches at California Sandwich and it was never this soggy.  The meat tasted good but I couldn't eat it like a real sandwich so that was unfortunate.  I'll probably go back and eat it at the restaurant next time and see what happens.  Oh yeah, the slice of pizza was alright too, nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for the office from here on Friday. This used to be my favourite go to place for pizza but unfortunately that's not the case anymore. 

The price was decent but the pizza toppings didn't go anywhere near the crust. The garlic bread was awful...just a kaiser bun cut up with butter on it. Really gross. 

And the staff was extremely overwhelmed and unorganized. 

I even saw the pizza guy grab my slice of pizza with his bare hands and throw it into a to go bag...really dude?

Overall: Food 3/5 Service 3/5 Decor 2/5"}
