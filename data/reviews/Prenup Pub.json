{"text":"I was here for lunch. Looked like a nice place to have a proper lunch and some chat with my friend.  I was amazed by the lunch special fish dish! so yummy and of big portion! the side salad was great too. loved the dressing and fresh vegetables. The service was good too. I would love to come here every time when I am in town."}
{"text":"We came here to eat, not to drink beer which was our first mistake. We came around 4pm and ordered German poutine to start and a New York steak and the croque Madame. The Poutine was pretty good, the sausage and gravy on it especially. When we got our main courses, I had ordered croque Madame but I received the croque Monsieur. The food was lukewarm and cheese started to solidify so it was probably sitting on the expo window for a while. The steak was overcooked, under seasoned: the mash potatoes were over seasoned with so much salt that it dries your lips and the veg was cold. Overall while I was impressed with the decor and beer menu, I was very disappointed with the food. Service was average."}
{"text":"Overall, a disappointing experience but I'm giving it the current rating hoping some points will improve with the benefit of the doubt considering they just recently opened.  The beer list on the website is much more extensive than what we were offered when we sat down as we were not given a list of bottles and trying to ask our server was a rather difficult task as he was either missing for extended periods of time or could not communicate very well in English.  Wait times were long for getting drinks, food, bill, etc. Again, this could be in part because our waiter was new, did not understand our order, and at the end, he simply went missing never to be seen again (and we had to approach a different server to get our last drink and bill).  We ordered two beers from the tap list and 1/2 liter of red wine. Our server had serious difficulty with our order for the wine even though we pointed out directly in the menu which wine we were ordering. The wine was corked and even the prospect of thinking about trying to point it out was unpleasant. If the server didn't understand that we were ordering the Bordeaux what hope was there for him to follow us when we explained that the wine was obviously corked and needed to be returned (something that had nothing to do with the storing or how long had it been opened).  Beers were good, so no complains there. I just wish I had been offered the bottle menu as well as the tap menu (don't even try to tell me that I should have asked for the bottle menu ... the few precious times we saw our server had to be used ordering food and ordering our first round of drinks).  The food was average but the menu needs to be more descriptive in terms of what is meant by certain items (considering the short list and plenty of space to do this, I'm surprised). Two savoury sandwiches (twists on French traditional fare) are offered with waffles instead of a bun. Given the savoury components it would be important to point out that the waffles will be covered in crystallized sugar and extremely sweet (either in the menu or by the servers). Burger and Belgian poutine were okay.  I'm not sure if I will go back, particularly with so many other places available. Perhaps wait a bit until they find their groove and have better trained servers.  I will update this review if we get the chance to visit it again."}
{"text":"I'm allergic to beer and wine, making this place a bit awkward for me. Some of the food options are great and some are mediocre.  The important thing I want to note about this place is that they do not have air conditioning. Well, I don't know if they have it, but if they do, I've never seen them run it. It was 33 degrees and there was no AC, so either they're extremely stingy, have a strange sense of how open windows are preferable to AC at all temperatures, or they just don't have AC.  It's a beautiful restaurant with a fantastic selection of beer, but I think I'm one with the leather seats now."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot for dinner and drinks.  Very good for groups as well.   It looks like a college bar o  the outside but on the outside it's actually very well done.  The food is awesome,  they have a really good menu.  Of all the times I've been, I've enjoyed all the food I've had.   The beer selection is awesome,  it's blows the majority of the competition out of the water.  Probably one of the best places to go relative to everything else in the area.    It's more of a dinner place than a bar or pub. I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went there twice recently and both times enjoyed the beers and food. We ordered braised octopus, beer braised chicken drums, pork riblettes, and mussles au gratin. My favorite were octopus and mussles (ordered both twice). Drums had less of a taste and quite a layer of crust - just not my cup of tea, but we still ate the plate:) I general, for the price you get really tasty dishes to accompany your beer.  My favorite beer was Laffe Bruns - has some fruit flavour which both me and wife loved.  Service was exellent. I called 2 hours in advance and asked for a table by the window. When we came, the table was waiting for us. The waitress Karina was quick and very welcoming. We never had to wait for anything and all the evening enjoyed the place very much.   Last time I was there they also played a good selection of songs from 80s-90s which we were pleased to hear.  I would definitely come to this place again, next time with my daughter."}
{"text":"One of the pubs I visit relatively frequently. With ~70 beers on tap, the selection is truly incredible. The beer menu is organized by country and the staff is knowledgeable and happy to recommend a particular brand based on your preference. Good burgers, and good food in general as well."}
{"text":"Not a dingy university pub you might expect from a place across St George campus. It's really nice on the inside, small patio available in summer.   Food is excellent quality.  The selection is ordinary pub stuff. I've had the beat salad, and the soup of the day which was a mushroom soup. Both were great.    Beer selection is great. Many German and Belgian beers available."}
{"text":"Very good food!   The Garlic Puff Pastry This was a pizza on phyllo dough and it was outstanding. A very unique dish and so delicious. I love anything that's crispy and flaky. Top it with garlic and cheese and I'm in heaven!   The Traditional Belgian Croquettes With smoked cheese and vegetables, these fried balls of goodness were crispy on the outside, soft, smoky and cheesy on the inside and very tasty!  The Portobello Schnitzel Delicious, fried perfectly (crisp breading, moist Portobello) and a nice-sized portion. Another unique dish as I've never seen this type of Schnitzel on any menu before. Very nice flavour with the pesto tomato sauce.   This pub is very charming on the inside. You can't tell from the outside but it's very nicely decorated on both floors. Management was great at accommodating our large group of people (20+). They didn't set a time limit for our group on a Saturday night which was why we selected this venue. They were also amazing at accommodating various food requirements for our party. Finally, our server was a sweetheart!"}
{"text":"Decent pub, walkable distance from work, a variety of selection on tap and bottles and decent food. We ordered two beers and Belgium Frites for $6 - I would not recommend it because it's just fries with chipotle mayo dip - you're better off getting the poutine for $9 to get your money's worth. Had their smoked salmon puff pastry pizza before and it was great.  Service isn't that great though because a lot of the waiters actually shows how unhappy they are working there and a sense of \"working together\" is definitely lacking.  I only come back because it's close to work and their food is decent."}
{"text":"Super swank, affordable and a huge selection of beer. This is the nice bar just of the U of T campus.  They can easily accommodate large groups.  The background music was soft enough that we could all talk to each other without yelling.   Overall a great place to lounge on a weekend."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick pint before heading to an event. It was a short walk from Queen's Park Station. Two levels of seating makes it easy to find somewhere to sit, but not easy to find your friends, if they've already arrived!  The beer selection was freaking fantastic. Wishing I could've stayed and tried more beers. It was hard to decide! A couple people in my small group grabbed some food and seemed satisfied. We were all collectively happy about the beer.  Service was good, pricing was average, seating was comfy.   I'd like to come back!"}
{"text":"The beer choice and atmosphere is excellent especially for a pub in the heart of university life. The food was average but It depends on what you order. Service was very good and we were a party of 8. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Pretty run of the mill pub. Large selection of beer even though they run to the pricey side. Pub is trying to be classy even though the main customers are university students."}
{"text":"Great bar close to uoft and the art gallery, a huge collection of beer. If youre going, try the pesto pizza. Super flaky buttery dough and just the right amount of cheese. It melts in your mouth and goes great with an ice cold beer. Im getting hungry now just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Amazing Belgium beer selection, for really reasonable prices. As a Belgium beer fanatic I loved it. Also, venue is quite big so good for large groups."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, class beer selection - one of the best in Toronto (if a bit dear)."}
{"text":"Sister of Sin & Redemption & co, this is a great spot to have a draught, or else with great gastropub food. Or not, just go for a drink with friends. Or with colleagues, visitors, collaborators, clients, etc. Whether you sport jeans or a suit.  The place is well decorated, feeling rich yet modern for a pub. The menu is diverse and satisfying. The food has always been up to expectations, if not more. Pastry dough is flaky, sauces varied and flavourful.  The waiters know their beers, can come up with suggestions easily, even with picky drinkers.  Don't let yourself be turned off by the banner/sign or even name. It is not a trash bar or a supper-club. It's a classy pub with a great draught selection."}
{"text":"ONLY DRINK HERE, DON'T EAT HERE.   This is a wonderfully comfortable place with an awesomely warm and luxurious interior of wood panelling and leather chairs.  The beer menu is extensive and each beer is extremely well described.  Great place for beer lovers to try a few pints that are hard to get elsewhere.  However, there's no way this place should be described as a gastropub.    Burgers are dense, flavourless masses of grey, grey meat.  Fries have that texture of fries left suspended over the oil or cooked in oil under temperature.  Pesto \"pizza\" looks like someone spread pesto over a Costco-sized pop tart.  The things they've done with food here are practically sacrilegious! And veggies, you doubly want to eat elsewhere.  They have eight-zillion specials and not even the soup is vegetarian.    I feel like there's a time/space anomaly going on between this pub and it's kitchen.  The pub is very cool and contemporary, but the kitchen is something torn from an airport terminal in 1976."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Classy atmosphere and European feel. Amazing Belgium beer selection.  Go and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent selection of beers near the university but I don't know if this place will cut it. The area is better served by cheaper menus and although the interior has been revamped it's still missing something. I enjoy the beer selection- and perhaps the location will help them out since it's so close to thirsty students, but there's a bit of life missing from this new pub."}
{"text":"Food probably 3.5, but value brings the rating up to a 4.  Nice that they have a huge beer selection, and my pour was perfect. I had a schnitzel sandwich with a side salad. The salad exceeded my exceptions and the sandwich was pretty good, albeit pretty standard.  I think the meal was only $11 or $12 bucks which is very good value, especially in the downtown core. Nicely decorated and comfortable feel to the place."}
{"text":"I have been here twice already and I am impressed.  First time I came here for drinks with colleagues after work.  They complained that there are no televisions and no wings, nachos or regular bar food on the menu.  Instead it has inventive food and great selection of beer and wine.  I had the waffle grilled cheese.  Cheesy and good.  What a difference a waffle makes!  Buoyed by my previous food experience I went with a good friend for lunch.  Oh boy!  Service was great,  friendly but not overly chatty.  The banquet seating was sumptuous and I felt a bit spoiled considering this used to be a smelly pub with worn out chairs.  Now it is leather with tucks and real silverware.  I had the salmon Wellington and I must say I was blown away by this perfectly cooked meal.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, flaky and yielding and the pastry was melt in your mouth.  I felt gobsmacked with the caliber of this food at a pub?!?? My friend had the puttanesca pasta which was delicious as well filled with fresh ingredients.  I am seriously thinking of graduating this to a dinner destination.  With great food and service I will be happy to come back here again and again.  And with the very nice digs I will not hesitate to come here for a business lunch."}
{"text":"Definitely deserves a 5 out of 5 for beer and ambience... especially compared to what was there before!   You go for the beer - and it delivers... They have something for everyone and they are so delicious.  The ambience and renovations are top notch.  Great new pub and big with a nice patio and an upstairs.   The only con is the food we came with a bunch of people and interested in sharing appetizers.  The charcuterie plate for 2 is ok, but definitely needs to come with some sort of crackers or bread - we had to keep asking for rolls of bread that we would have to cut / tear which is not ideal for sharing.  Tried the german poutine and the eggplant dish - all were quite tasty... I guess the charcuterie plate was a disappointment and a simple addition of some carbs would go a long way.  The burger looked epic though."}
{"text":"Went here late was serving food after turned away from O'Grady's.  The meal was very good and so was the service.  My wife had the stew and I had the schnitzel. Again very good. Only down fall no chilled glasses for beer so beer not that cold but best overall meal we have had all week."}
{"text":"The beer selection here is amazing; Leffe Blonde, Dekoninck. I had no complaints with my prime rib burger. My buddies had the German poutine and they seemed to enjoy that as well. It had big pieces of sausage and a thick dark gravy. The menu prices are very fair and the atmosphere is cozy and classy. There is an upstairs area to this place as well, with a bar. This place seems to be the spot, as it filled up quite quickly. I am definitely going back again."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner with a girlfriend on a Thursday evening. I had an amazing chicken stew and my friend loved her puff pastry pizza. Large beer selection - we tried a few new ones. Great service, comfortable seating. Had an amazing evening. I just wish the name wasn't so stupid."}
{"text":"Good location for a beer... Not for food! The prenup pub offers a large variety of beers from everywhere. Good choices!  But the food clearly doesn't deserve a star!!! The fries are bad and the burger was half cold.  Go for an after work but find another spot for diner!"}
{"text":"Wow, amazing pub. Amazing staff. But the toilets are the size of airplane bathrooms. and the beer is all minimum $9. No cheap beer here."}
{"text":"This pub's got a pretty funny name... hahaha Food and drinks were great here, service was so-so.  DRINKS: Sir Perry Pear Cider and Affligem German beer  HERBED EGGPLANT 2.5/5 (Tomatoes, ricotta cheese, arugula, bread) I was expecting a hot dish - something along the lines of baked eggplants with herbs  and all the listed veggies on the side.. but it's okay.. It gets better the more you eat this but I wouldn't order this again haha  BEER BRAISED LAMB 4/5 The phyllo pastry was so good! :)  The lamb was very juicy - a lot of sauce on this one. Yummy!  PUFF PASTRY PIZZA - CHARCUTERIE PIZZA 3/5 The puff pastry was yummy - the pizza could use more sauce though.  Side note:  Don't sit near the windows!! I think I had the worst seat at the pub - I was facing the window where I could see the window ledge from the other building.. There were bird poop EVERYWHERE omg LOL... Lost my appetite at one point *barf. I don't know how they can actually clean it though LOL soo grossss.."}
{"text":"Came here with the lab for a lunch... The last time I came here was back when it was known as Pour Girl so it's been a few years.  We were seated outside because majority won (I honestly would've preferred to sit inside, alas) and the waiter came by to take drinks.  The drink menu is very extensive.  The food menu - not so much but take note of the specials sign near the entrance.  I got the chicken alfredo fettucini (special of the day) and it was fine, nothing too special about it.  Would come back here for more drinks and food but on a cooler day and would stay indoors!"}
{"text":"Love the service. I really love that one server weird accent and shit. Treated me and my entire crew pretty decently. Usually i won't recommend this bar to people, but Cuz of the customer service from weird accented girl.. Yeah I will buy drinks from her."}
{"text":"Prenup Pub is the latest outpost in the empire anchored by Sin & Redemption, the Village Idiot, and the Town Crier.  It provides a decent beer outpost to a section of College Street and the U of T campus that are sorely lacking good beer.  The Pros: The beer list is generally pretty good and extensive.  Quite a few Belgian beers, some Germans, etc.  It's a little weak on the Belgian count compared to Sin & Redemption, but perfectly tolerable.  The draft prices are reasonable...maybe even a bit less than what one would pay at completely ordinary bars down the road.    The bottle list is great with incredibly reasonable prices.  An Achel bruin for $8?  Amen!  They've done a decent job with the renovations at this spot, which was previously a bit depressing.  The Cons: Like most of the sister restaurants service is generally the weak point.  Turnover seems to be rather high and the staff are generally given almost no beer training....don't ask for a recommendation here...use google or your friends instead.  Also, what is up with this completely silly name.  Is this a regret of the owner to have not signed a prenup?  The signs on the outside are quite amateurish.  Kind of funny.  I haven't tried the food yet, so stay tuned for an update."}
{"text":"Decent pub right new UofT's campus.  I've never tried their food, but their selection of beers is excellent. The waitstaff are also incredibly knowledgeable and very willing to recommend beers to try.  Will most definitely return to try a few more different beers and possibly some food as well."}
{"text":"Delicious from start to finish. The staff are so friendly and super attentive, maybe a bit too serious. I may have saw one of them smile, once. Maybe. Anyway, the decor is classy, upscale and it makes me feel like I belong there. I chose the specials for my lunch. The curry coconut chicken soup was SO GOOD. I followed it up with the chicken cordon bleu. The chicken was a little over-cooked and I found it odd that they put marinara on it along with ham and Swiss cheese. It was still very good and I certainly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Summary: If you're a Beer fan GO HERE!!! - they have decent pub food too :)  5* for the Beer selection which is out of this world in my opinion! If you are a beer lover then this will definitely be like heaven to you. They have a huge selection of beers from all over the world with something for everyones tastes and preferences.  I would give the food around 4* just because it is generic pub food and to be honest I have only had a couple of things on their food menu :). But everything from the burger to the pasta and the soup has been really good! Plus the portions are pretty big. I found the service a bit slow when I went there to eat especially considering that I was pretty early for lunch and there weren't that many people there so I can imagine the wait being pretty long if you go during peak lunch/dinner times.  Prices for the entrees range from $11-$25 I believe, I usually get the burger or the Schnitzel which are $12 and $15, respectively, with a choice of salad, fried or soup. The atmosphere is really great, very cosy place with a nice ambience and really comfortable chairs. It would totally work for a good, fairly cheap date night!"}
{"text":"Prenup pub   Was here on a Saturday evening around 5/6 not too many people. My first time at this gastro bar, my wife has been there a few times I thought I'd give it a try! We were a group of 7 people.    Location: On College st, just across the street of UofT. On street parking only. Nearest parking lot is on McCaul a few minutes walk from the pub. You can find on street parking near by, but it's very limited. 3/5 stars   Atmosphere: Even during the day, the interior was very dark. Very much a pub feel, decor is man cave look with leather everywhere. Not so loud music so conversation within your party is not a screaming match.  4/5 stars   Service: Well here's where it starts to go down hill for me. We were ready for order, even when flagging other waiters, they would not take our order since they did not handle our table. For a non busy time, it took them a long time to bring out the food. Furthermore, we had to request several time for water and was ignored. We were also being pressured to vacate the tables, although there was no line up. Very poor service 1/5 stars   Food: Typical bar food. I ordered a grilled chicken wrap with fries and my wife had the lamb. Nothing special, no real good flavours. The lamb was bland and chewy. As a Montrealer, I was disappointed to find out they call fries, gravy and mozzarella cheese as a poutine. I'm sorry but that's not a real poutine. Plus the gravy was too salty 1/5 stars   Price: Everything was reasonably priced. As a pub, their beer is priced correctly, non inflated. 3/5 stars   Overall: Not really impressed with this place. I guess they are still in business because of the university across the street. A bar near campus is a plus. Come for drinks but make sure you eat before going there. 2/5 stars  Follow me for more pictures on:  Instagram: 905japes Twitter: 905Japes"}
{"text":"Great selection of Belgium beers. The best beer pub Ive been to so far in Toronto."}
{"text":"Huge selection of beer!! Love the food but I hated how the chairs are so crowded together. Good drinking spot with some appys and that's it."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at the Prenup Pub on College Street.  The staircase to get to the bathrooms is cool.  Gord ordered the Pork Schnitzel with Mustard & Horseradish.  He said it was really good and he'd get it again.  The pork schnitzel was huge!  I ordered the Prenup Burger.  It was okay.  The burger was a bit overcooked but tasty and the bun was a bit much.  The fries were good.  I probably wouldn't get it again.   Matt was our server.  He was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 5 minutes. Despite there being plenty of staff around, no one said a word to me. I left."}
{"text":"Haha, it's funny because I've been here consistently for three years and have never written a review. This place is really the most popular grad student spot for good german/belgian beers. I've lost count of the numerous nights drinking alone at the bar, quietly calling up my boyfriend on the phone and having a conversation. Good memories here and the food is spot on. Their steak, mussels and schnitzels are to die for!"}
{"text":"Wow! Such a beautiful gastropub. It is such a beautifully designed restaurant, from the seating to the ceilings, to the spotless washrooms! They really turned the place inside out (though I do miss Pour Girl!).   Have been here a couple of times now. We ordered the Beer Braised Chicken Drums which have become my favourite! Moist and crispy with a hint of maple - definitely recommend you try it. Madame Monsieur Waffle - a delicious waffle and savoury meat, but a bit too heavy and salty for my taste. Don't regret trying it though! Charcuterie Pizza - the fact that it is made with puff pastry is so unique and like a whole new pizza experience! The meats and cheeses were a perfect medley. Would definitely get this again! The Belgian Frites are quite delicious as well.  They have a beautiful upper level seating area that looks like it would be great for private functions.  Overall, as a student, this is a great hang out for a quick drink and a bite to eat. Delicious food in a classier atmosphere compared to the other pubs by the university."}
{"text":"Nice decor, terrible service. Bar wasn't that busy, and it was difficult to get anyone's attention to give them money for amber coloured liquids. Upstairs bar has this stupid thing blocking the view of the bartender from the customers."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place. I've gone back several times since it opened hoping things have improved but improvements if any have been marginal. My hope is that the management reads this and gets their act together. When this placed first opened I was very excited, I love Town Crier (same management, similar look, same excellent beer menu) and it is very close to work. So, I made a reservation for a work group of 12 to have lunch there. Upon arrival, they had no record of our reservation that day. They were able to sit us in the bar area at some hightop tables, not ideal for a working lunch but we're easy to please so who cares. They were clearly understaffed but food for the table not only took an exceedingly long time but the first persons food and the last persons food arrived 25 minutes apart. I am not exaggerating, I only wish I was! In addition, the upstairs area was having the floor washed with what smelled like bleach, not sure it had been diluted and the smell was enough to burn your nostril hairs off. The next morning I got a call to confirm my reservation for that day, what!?! I let them know they had written the wrong date and took the opportunity to let the staff know what the issues had been.   The next time I took a work group there was months later. I made a reservation for 27 people in the upstairs room one evening. I had to phone once to change the time, I got the sense the person on the phone wasn't actually writing down any of the information I was telling them so I dropped by on my way home from work one day to check and sure enough, it hadn't been changed. WHen we arrived for the reservation I was told there were two reservations made that evening, both by people with my first name and that the reservation associated with my telephone number was for 12 not 27 and the other persons reservation was for 27. I let them know that there had been a mix up and that I was the reservation for 27 and they basically didn't believe me and gave me a whole ton of attitude about it. Sure enough when the other group showed up they were a group of 12! Again, during this visit they seemed understaffed, some people left before all of their drinks came because it was taking too long but I'm sure a group of 27 is hard to accommodate.   My third work event there was a lunchtime group of 12 the other day. This time the food arrived much more timely (yeah for them!). However, some appetizers did arrive after the entrees and several people had to ask the staff for condiments or drinks several times before receiving them. A coworker and I both ordered the mussels. I can not begin to tell you how bad they were. The taste of them made me think they might actually make me sick. I was so nervous about it that I only ate about 1/5 of the serving and passed on the rest. I want to be clear that I did not end up getting sick, I'm not claiming that this place gave me food poisoning or is a public health risk, it just tasted that way!   I've also gone for beers there on several occasions and haven't been disappointed by those experiences. I love the beer selection! Five stars for the beer. The moral of this long winded story is, if you are going for food, especially in a larger group just don't bother. If you are a beer person and going to grab a drink after work this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Selection of beer was pretty extensive. I asked our waitress to recommend a fruity beer and she brought over a cherry flavoured beer (tasted like cherry blasters) and it was quite good though a bit pricier. Also ordered their take on croque Monsieur (or Madame, I don't remember) and it was quite interesting...they used sweet waffles (maybe even glazed with sugar) and had the ham and cheese on top which gave it a cool sweet and savoury taste. Their German poutine fries (I think) was very bland though, the sausages add nothing to the poutine.   Our waitress was very kind but the server waiting for the table behind us appeared to be rude and annoyed by his table."}
{"text":"The positive is that this pub has a large variety of beers on tap, but some beers are not as cold as they should be. My friends' beer was less colder than beer should be at a bar. The atmospher is great though. In terms of food, they only have 1 type of burger, called the Prenup burger which I ordered, and the edges were a bit burnt. The fries weren't that good, it was ok."}
{"text":"I've  recently spent a total of 8 days here in Toronto connecting from the USA to Europe. My first impression of the town, apart from being absolutely so much bigger than I expected, was that it was quite an expensive place to eat out.... and I ate out a LOT.. with the guidance of my friends who are \"dowtown locals\".  Just before I was leaving I met up with an old friend, we had worked  together in a pub in Belgium many years ago and she had booked lunch at this place for old times sake. .   First impression was that it was the usual  student hangout.. but once I got inside I could not help but admire the very cool classy interior.   I loved my comfortable leather chair and adequate table space.  The servers were seriously attentive and presented a menu with a huge array of pub food and Belgian and German beers.    As I live close to the Napa Valley, I am  a prettty much dedicated Chardonnay drinker.. and I was blown away by a decent glass for about half the price that I had been paying elsewhere.  The burger, again was oversized and the side of Belgian Frites took us on a trip down memory lane., and both were really yummy.   Service was efficient and attentive (you Canadians are so polite).    I loved this place, hence my score... and now I am going to revaluate my opinion of your expensive city.. ,"}
{"text":"For my prenup pub review it gets a 2/5 for the simple fact that the food killed this review. But let's start with the positives.  First arriving at the prenup pub you think it has a cool name but looks like any other pub from the outside. When you get in however, the ambiance changes that opinion. The servers are fast to help you and providing great customer service.  The beer menu is in-depth and provides a great variety of beer from around the world. I personally had the Omer beer from Belgium which was 12% alcohol for $8.00. I enjoyed that.  We ordered the German poutine to start. The portion had a great variety of sausage, fries, kurds and gravy however the food was way to salty. My entree was the pork schnitzel. I was greatly disappointed with this choice. The food was just bland and to salty. I would not choose that again.   For those wanting to grab a quick beer after a hard days work I would recommend the prenup pub. If you want a nice dinner out with a hot date, I would steer clear of the prenup pub."}
{"text":"Came here to meet a friend for dinner on Saturday. As I was waiting for my friend, the bartender was chatting me up. Very nice fellow, Australian guy named Troy. Made me feel quite welcomed and kept me company until my friend arrived.  My friend ordered the butternut squash ravioli in a red pepper pasta sauce. It was tasty! And the fries with some sort of garlicky mayo was very good as well.  Highly recommended."}
