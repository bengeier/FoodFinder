{"text":"We went there with high expectations being such big fans of spanish tapas.  First off, despite there being plenty of room in the back of the restaurant, we were made to sit in the front by the main door where we were constantly exposed to cold air. The décor is indeed stunning and the atmosphere nice. But the clientèle is on the older side, and snootier side.  The menu at first glance looks amazing. Especially in terms of the number of vegetarian options.  We ordered the pan con tomate, the patatas bravas, the catalan spinach, the roasted vegetables with romesco sauce and the vegetarian paella. To say the least, we were very underwhelmed by the flavors. Which, unfortunately, is not in line with the concept of tapas.  The true judge of a good tapas place is the success by which they undertake the pan con tomate. This one was essentially flavourless tomato on decent bread. The roasted vegetables were ok, the eggplant was raw inside, and there was a very minimal pocket of romesco sauce that did not wow the tastebuds. The spinach was awful, essentially just boiled and serve with a few raisins and pine nuts. Nowhere near the true dish that we have eaten many times in Spain and at other spanish restaurants. Patatas bravas were probably the best part, but that is being generous. Again only a minimal amount of sauce. Now the paella, tasted like minute rice with frozen vegetables and unflavoured tomato sauce topped with the same bland set of roasted vegetables as our other dish.  The wine was decent, and the service good. However the food arrived much too fast, again going against the concept of tapas where you enjoy one or two dishes at a time and slowly get the other ones throughout the evening. The table next to ours received all their dishes at once, and so they were literally hanging over the edge of the table. But I suppose this is the restaurant's way to ensure rapid turnover.  I would NOT recommend this restaurant and will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Six of us had dinner there on New Year's Eve.  We can't say enough good things about it.  It only opened a week ago - but they have things running as smoothly as if they had been open for much longer. There was a beautiful prix fixe menu which one of our party chose, and the rest of us selected many, many tapas and a few of the paellas. We feasted, literally for hours, and everything we had was excellent.   The menu was very extensive, and really, we enjoyed everything.  (One wish for a change - that the tuna were cooked slightly less, but honestly that is it.)  Our waitress was as close to perfect as you could hope for.  I wish we could remember her name so we could compliment her justly (she just moved back east from out west).  After we ordered, she planned out which items to pair together, and she paired everything beautifully.  She was wonderfully attentive, and gracious.  Best of luck to the owners - you've created a beautiful place with a warm, welcoming vibe, and a great menu.  Thanks for making New Years so nice for us!"}
{"text":"The food disappointed me and experienced the worst service ever here, waited the staff 10 minutes for ordering our meal , and because the food is too salty, asked for the water then he just forgot it and keep serving the tables around us."}
{"text":"Food is definitely on the saltier side and their seafood paella disappointed me. The place itself feels very cool and the staff is knowledgeable. Hard to find parking around (although they have valet service at night)!   For two people (sharing an appetizer, a charcuterie, and the main) costs around 130$."}
{"text":"Beautiful chichi restaurant in the heart of downtown Montreal. Decor and design was very trendy and nice.  It's a tapas place so do expect to spend a lot or leave the place still hungry. We order a lot of food (bill came out a little over $200) and our belly weren't really full. Food tasted good and the presentation was beautiful. But will we come back for the amount of food served versus the price paid. Probably not. I would say that the place next door (Ferreira Café) is 10X better!"}
{"text":"A real gem!  My husband and I accidentally found this place upon a late night arrival from Halifax.  I highly suggest sitting at the bar to eat and if your lucky, Marie will be working.  Their octopus is far above anything I've had on the east coast. With only a few days in Montreal, and meeting up with my parents there, we chose to bring them back.  My husband is an executive chef and couldn't bare not to have a second meal there to further explore the menu.  Charming and sophisticated atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"This place is fancy Spanish tapas and I like the location but honestly I've had better Spanish food elsewhere.  The iberica caesar was awesome! It was spicy and salty and topped with an iberica ham chip and a deep fried anchovy. I then had a glass of Spanish red wine which was also very good.  We started off with the coca con tomate which is a baguette cut up with tomatoes and olive oil and sea salt. I usually love this dish even though it's so simple. The bread was hard and I've had better tomatoes bread at other Spanish restos. Then we had the jamon iberica. This was very good. It legit melted in our mouth. The slices were very thin though.   We ordered the mixed croquetas but instead of getting one of each we ordered two lobster/shrimp croquetas and two cod croquetas. They were both good but if I had to choose one I would suggest the cod.   Next came the grilled octopus with Yukon gold  potatoes cut up in small cubes with lemon and oil. It was well cooked but some pieces were super salty. It's too bad because otherwise it would have been my favourite dish of the night. We also ordered the filet mignon tapas with black pepper sauce because the waitress recommended it. It was good but also salty but less salty than the grilled octopus. The filet mignon was supposed to be cooked medium rare but it was actually more medium.   For dessert we had the chocolate beignet. I took half of one and was like \" nope, not worth the calories \" . My boyfriend said it wasn't sweet enough because it was dark chocolate but still ate the whole thing. lol   It's a nice fancy Spanish resto but there are better Spanish restos in Montreal in my opinion."}
{"text":"The first impression was very bad because of the lady at the entry with cold face. She brought me to the table. Then, she took my coat, gave me a tag for pick up coat and just leave without saying anything, not even a smile. Maybe it was because I was waiting for friends, no one talk to me or offer a cup of water for ten minutes... However, after five minutes, a waitress with a very warm smile asked me do I want to drink something. She also tried to help us find a bigger table because a friend decided to join us at the last The decoration in the restaurant is pretty fancy. The food and the wine is deeeelicious. But one thing the restaurant need to improve is the attention to wineglass. They gave my friend a champagne wineglass with a little damage that could hurt her mouth. Fortunately, she used other side of the wineglass before finding this issue. Despite those negative impressions, it is a good bistro for hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"This place is a fancy Spanish tapas and I like the location, across from my Hotel (still getting over foot surgery) Iberica is a beautiful chichi restaurant in the heart of downtown Montreal. Decor and design is very trendy and nice.  It's a tapas place so do expect to spend a lot or leave the place still hungry. I ordered several plates and some wine too.  The bill came out a little over $130 USD including 20% tip. Food tasted good and the presentation was beautiful. I would say that the place next door (Ferreira Café) would be a good choice too. These are the dishes I ordered: Marinated White Anchovies with smashed tomatoes on grilled bread, Scallops with romesco sauce and parsley oil, Clams with Artichokes and Chorizo. Wine and coffee too."}
