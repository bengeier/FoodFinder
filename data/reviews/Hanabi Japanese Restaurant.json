{"text":"Don't drink the tap water... I'd say it is ok sushi. Not the best I've ever had, but not the worst. Kind of warm, and the avocado didn't seem fresh. Also tons of flies flying around you.."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good considering that on Wednesdays they offer half off sushi and the quality of sushi is decent. Typically a sushi dinner with four rolls and two beers puts you at about $65-70, we only paid $40. Being from California, I'd say this is some good stuff, just make sure you come on a day that it's half off."}
{"text":"The udon was fine. As was the teriyaki. However, the spicy tuna roll looked like the fish had been dyed red, to the extent that the rice was turning pink, which makes me worry about the freshness. But mainly I have a cleanliness issue. The back area where the bathrooms are is quite grimy. The walls and doors could use some scrubbing so they're uniformly white. The door to the kitchen is especially gross. I'm pretty sure there was blood on the door frame of the ladies' room."}
{"text":"Delicous sushi!!!! Portion of the rice & the fish is perfect :) Out of all the places we've eaten in Cleveland this place definitely nailed how tuna tataki is suppose ti be serve!!!! We met the owner & he is a very nice  Japanese Man & we found out that he used to be the owner of Daishin wich is not a bad place to eat as well. Def. Will be coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for sushi and stumbled upon this place. I didn't try the special rolls but what I had was great. I'll definitely be back (and they don't close until 1030!)"}
{"text":"Best sushi place downtown hands down. Half price sushi Wednesdays too. Highly recommend the Hanabi special roll"}
{"text":"Delicious/ hosts were wonderful. Best sushi in downtown! Yum yum roll and fugi roll were a delight!"}
{"text":"Delicious, high quality sushi at great prices. Not much more to be said. If you are a sushi fan, this is the place to be in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I definitely would recommend because I had a good time. My friends and I planned to eat here a couple weeks ago and we all enjoyed our meals! The food is delightful and and the staff are friendly and show courtesy."}
{"text":"Came here recently for dinner after researching best Sushi in Cleveland. I used to live in NYC so I have been spoiled by good sushi in my life! This place had great reviews so we chose it, and on a Saturday evening they were having a half-off special which was great. We ordered seaweed salad, which was good, and a bunch of rolls-- but they were mediocre at best-- the sashimi pieces were really thick and really cold (as if just defrosted) and the rolls had massive amounts of rice so they fell apart sometimes. I would recommend this place if you haven't had much sushi in your life, I believe they are probably great for Cleveland but if you really love sushi and have had a lot you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest sushi I've ever had.  Slight mixup that one of the rolls was spicy tuna instead of plain tuna and I can't do spicy.  Other than that, everything was good.  Definitely the best, most fresh yellowtail I've had.  Oddly enough, great water.  Mochi is one of my favorite desserts and theirs is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Food was great, atmosphere is quiet, service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Best sushi and sashimi we've had in Cleveland! Added bonus, oh waitress gave us a $5 coupon for our next visit! Great service, fresh food, and very inexpensive"}
{"text":"The whole experience is perfect here. The cooks do an amazing job with both the sushi and the udon soups. I have been here 3 times already and every time I come I try a different roll and I haven't been disappointed. The servers are always sweet, attentive and professional. This is my go to place for sushi in Cleveland now."}
{"text":"Subpar sushi and I'm not even that picky.  Went on a Saturday for the half off deal and have a strong feeling that they only run that deal twice a week (Wednesday and Saturday) to get rid of fish that isn't as fresh.  Sushi lacked flavor and wasn't really even all that worth the discounted price."}
{"text":"Maybe it was because we came on half off wednesday, but this sushi just didnt do it for me. Rice wasnt seasoned enough and also cold instead of room temp. Really didnt care for their spicy sauce and those are usually some of my favorites. Maybe Ill give it another shot"}
{"text":"Love this place! I may have come to an end in my quest for finding fresh sushi at an affordable price!! everything is well executed! The staff is also very personable!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Best in Cleveland. Best I've ever had anywhere. Every roll I've ever had there has been amazing and delectable. So many neat and fun kinds to try you can't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food. Amazing service. Authentic Japanese sushi. I can't find another sushi restaurant in Cleveland that even comes close to the quality I get here."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great location in the warehouse district"}
{"text":"What a little hole in the wall BUT what AMAZING food they have and it's super clean too!  Fantastic ambiance.  Had the lobster bisque that was clearly homemade and delicious and the sushi.  Out of this world.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I have no idea how this place has such high ratings. I just watched the sushi chef put fried shrimp in the MICROWAVE to make my shrimp tempura roll (because I didn't trust fresh fish here - thank god!)."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced sushi- had heard good things about it but I wasn't very impressed. I had the shrimp tempura sushi and the tempura was cold when my food arrived. Same with the tempura cheesecake-- it was room temp which was not what I was expecting. My shrimp didn't taste that fresh either. They had a nice wine selection with a Japanese plum wine that was very good."}
{"text":"Amazingggg! Found this place on Yelp (of course) when in town visiting for work. In a week and a half I've been here 3 times. I think I've got a solid 3 more visits left before I head back to the South. The sushi is exquisite! So delicious and I wouldn't have that expectation being its location in the mid west. The staff is so friendly and incredibly attentive. The best sushi I've had in a while and on Wednesday's and Saturday's they have half off rolls! Love, love, love! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I got the bento box lunch special and it was such an amazing deal! With it you get your choice of an entree, choice of a sushi roll, choice of a side, miso soup, and white rice all for around $12! 

I opted for the steak teriyaki as my main entree and I was honestly surprised by how delicious it was! It was perfectly cooked and tender. The teriyaki was just right - not too sweet! I also got a salmon roll with my lunch that was delicious! My gyoza as a side was crispy pan fried and delicious. 

This comes with so much to eat and is a good quick lunch for $12! They also are available to be delivered through Uber eats!"}
{"text":"It is okay. Not the best Japanese food but I also eat worst. Being run by real Japanese people I expected more to be honest. But I can't complain though."}
{"text":"We were immediately seated upon our entry into Hanabi, and sat at a comfortable table and chairs. Our waitress took our drink orders right away and everything was brought to us rather quickly which was very nice because we were very hungry. Hanabi was having a half price roll day where all rolls were half price, as long as each person ordered two rolls. This was fabulous! My husband and I ordered 4 rolls between the two of us. My sushi choices are sadly limited due to my pregnancy so I opted for the Orange Ball roll and Fire Ball roll (both fried). To be honest I wasn't a fan of the spicy tuna and the spicy salmon, especially the spicy salmon. It tasted rather fishy. Both fishes could have been more fresh. Overall, the rolls satisfied my sushi craving. Whenever I'm not pregnant I would like to return and try some of their rolls that are not fried. My husband really enjoyed his spicy salmon scallops roll and his dragon roll. I also ordered green tea and appreciated the quality of this tea! It was brewed from green tea leaves, no tea bags involved! The waitress kept refilling my tea class which was nice. :) I liked the atmosphere too. They played real Japanese music which was much nicer than the top 20 playlist you hear everywhere."}
{"text":"We had wonderful food here and it came out fast and fresh. Our kids were given crayons  to color with and stay occupied. We will definitely be going back. We ordered too much food and ended up with leftovers that we boxed up. The server was nice enough to run them outside to us after we were already in our car. That is exceptional service!!!!!"}
{"text":"3-4 stars Pretty dead when I went which made it a little less fun, but I can't complain. The pink lady, seaweed salad and sweet potato roll were all delicious"}
{"text":"Excellent and very very fresh. Ordered Mango Tuna Roll - out of this world and the Spicy Tuna Spicy Salmon w avocado, just the right spicy. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I never heard of this place until a few days ago but I will definitely come back.  The place is small but has a decent sushi selection.  It was lacking in the sake department though.  Service was fast, presentation was impressive, and sushi was good."}
{"text":"I think it has taken a while for word to spread about Hanabi, but people are finally catching on to this secret gem in plain sight which is my favorite sushi place in downtown Cleveland. 

The sushi here is delicious, and the fish is always very fresh. I've been here numerous times, and tried everything from their tempura, to the chirashi, bibimbap, teriyaki, and numerous rolls. My favorite, though, is the nigiri because they will give you the freshest pieces of fish which are large enough to drape over the rice with their delicious buttery freshness, unlike some places which give you a large ball of rice with a small piece of fish on top, and call that nigiri.

Their restaurant week deal (30 bucks, all you can eat (with reasonable exceptions)) was awesome because I got to try almost every roll on the menu. 

Service has always been fantastic. Love love Hanabi and can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Are all the Japanese restaurants in US run by Korean? Didn't realize what was wrong about the menu until I heard the music they were playing (k-pop). Why would a Japanese restaurant sell bulgogi? Although the food was average and I would give three stars for that, dining is not all about the food and the experience matters a lot. I came to the restaurant hoping to get a feel of japan but I heard the songs from all my favorite Korean girls groups, Girls day, Tara, Hyuna etc. That was definitely not the experience that I was expecting. But to those of you who aren't able to tell the difference between Japanese and Korean, this place would be perfect to get some exotic experience."}
{"text":"Apparently Wednesday is the day to come for half priced sushi, unfortunately I came on a Tuesday.  Not great - not bad, just average sushi."}
{"text":"The food was very good but there are lots of restaurants with good or average food that give good service and make dining enjoyable. This place had terrible service and the hostess that greeted us upon arrival and waited on our table was terribly rude.  For.this reason we will never go back and would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Wednesday night 1/2 pice sushi.
Awesome price for awesome rolls!!
Great service.
Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Finally, good quality sushi downtown! The edamame and veggie tempura appetizers were awesome. All the sushi rolls were fantastic. The staff were very friendly and attentive. All the food came out quickly. The price was very reasonable for the quality, in my opinion. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! 

After coming here 4 mondays in a row for lunch, I realized I'm addicted to Hanabi's sushi! Their lunch deals are pretty legit. My go-to is the Sushi lunch platter which comes with 6 california rolls & 5 assortments of real sushi (usually its salmon, tuna, white fish & shrimp) AND a cup of miso soup all for $12. 

That's cheaper than picking up a to-go sushi lunch at Constantino's or Heinen's thats for damn sure!"}
{"text":"I came for the sushi! I was disappointed...

The interior design has Japanese influence and had low lighting. It's very spacious with a lot of seating. The service is great and they are very attentive. They also have promotional offers on certain days/times! The menu has much to offer with appetizers, sushi, rice dishes, platters, etc. 

Their dumplings and mochi were good, but looked prepackaged...

Now, back to the sushi. The rice is cold and hard, which is just something I do not enjoy with my sushi. The fish quality was edible the least to say. The second time I came back, one of my salmon pieces looked as though it was rotting...don't worry I did not eat that piece. I did not have food poisoning after either so all is good. 

I will not lie to you guys, I probably will be coming back for more sushi since the location is so accessible to me and their sushi are priced very well."}
{"text":"When we lived in Akron and even North Canton, we had several choices for good sushi. When we moved to Cleveland, it felt like there were not any good options. I really, really enjoyed this place. The fish was very fresh and high quality. The miso soup was very flavorful. Even the green tea seemed to have a better flavor than most restaurants around here. As other people have mentioned, the service was great: attentive, quick, and we chatted with them a bunch! So glad to have a delicious sushi place to count on now."}
{"text":"Hanabi is definitely a great local spot to grab sushi fast. No fuss. No wait. Nothing glamorous. I typically get takeout, so Hanabi is just the place I'm looking for.  

It goes without saying that Wednesday's are such a steal at Hanabi. With everything half off, I can be full for $15! Fantastic yet terrifying, but it hasn't stopped me from going back.

I will say that if you go on any day other than Wednesday, the place is absolutely dead inside, so I don't know if I'd recommend it for a date or even if you want a place that's more lively. 

I should probably talk about the fish. While I'm not super impressed with the quality, I appreciate this place for simple maki rolls and some of the special rolls. They're fresh, simple and tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, piping hot Udon was perfect on a cold day. They have big pieces of Nigiri and very friendly service. Solid, authentic spot."}
{"text":"Not to bad of a product for the price. From the Chicago area and this was decent and affordable. I don't think you would be disappointed in it."}
{"text":"The place was empty when we arrived on a Monday around dinner time. We ordered four rolls and rock shrimp. Everything lacked flavor. The spicy mayo was not spicy at all, the fried tempura lacked salt, and even the soy sauce seemed to lack flavor somehow. The avocado on my roll had pieces that had turned brown already, not sure why I was served it and makes me question the freshness of the food. We left disappointed. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Northeast Ohio in 3 years. Lots of fresh meat, and flavor. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Hanabi pretty regularly since they first opened. It is my favorite place to get sushi in Cleveland. They have a good variety of options, consistent quality, great presentation, and amazing service."}
{"text":"Hanabi is awesome. They have half priced sushi on Wednesday so it is a PERFECT spot for lunch. I can walk there from my office and they never have a wait (although they stay consistently busy during the lunch hour.)

They have \"boats\" of sushi that are great to order with large groups. Reasonably priced and quick service. I definitely recommend Hanabi for the sushi lover."}
{"text":"Cleveland, OH.  Whole soft shell crab lightly battered in panko and deep fried was very good. But the special sushi roll called \"No name\" should have been a warning. It was just okay. Was supposed to be spicy crab and avocado. Crab was nothing special and the avocado topping did not do much. First dessert, tried vanilla fried ice cream. Too much breading of some sort, almost 1/2 inch thick. Wish they also offered just plain I ever cream."}
{"text":"When we pulled up to the valet I looked at the front of this restaurant and cringed. It looks like a hole in the wall from outside. However, once we stepped inside, it was a whole different story. We were promptly greeted and seated at a nice table by the window. We ordered drinks and sushi and they both came out very fast. The sushi quality was really good. There are a lot of different rolls to choose from. Can you find equivalent sushi elsewhere? Yes. But what's special about this place is the fact that there's no wait for a table and the staff are very attentive."}
{"text":"This gem should be the Best rated spot in Cleveland since sushi rock closed years ago. The chef is a wonderful man who even made us a after dinner roll of shrimp and sweet cream for free ... Red head roll real crab roll spicy white tuna roll and the philly crunch all very creamy and tasty. Love this place and will be back tomorrow !!!"}
{"text":"This place was mediocre at best. The sushi quality was not even worth the price during 1/2 off Wednesday. My friends and I ordered several maki rolls and five of their special rolls. None of the rolls stood out as good. The quality and cut of the fish was sub-par. Very thin and flavorless. The rice used was on the cold/hard side and was not seasoned well. The rolls were not well wrapped either. A lot of the pieces fell apart when picked up. They also skimped on the filling. Not to mention the maki rolls were quite small. The scallop sashimi was awful. It was a large scallop cut into several pieces rather than sliced thinly like most other sushi places. The scallop was not sweet nor was it as fresh it should be for sashimi. 

Perhaps they are much better on full price days. But their regular prices are a bit on the high side, especially for this quality. The service was so-so as well. Only filled the tea once and they were $2 per person. My water was not refilled at all. There was only one waitress (who may be the owner) running between 5-6 tables as well as being the host."}
{"text":"The newly opened Hanabi Japanese Restaurant surprised me with high quality gourmet sushi. The restaurant itself has somewhat mixed traditional and modern atmosphere. The layout was open and comfortable to dine in. The portion or the size of sushi was perfect with delicious and professional display.

Since I am in love with sushi, I tried almost all Japanese restaurant in Cleveland area, and this new restaurant is by far the best! Sushi was fresh, especially tuna, salmon, and sea urchin. Hanabi's special rolls are unique and exceptional by taste and looks. Their soy sauce is home made low sodium, it wasn't like strong salty old soy sauce that I'm used to. It was refreshing and healthy! 

Service was phenomenon. A server was very kind and gentle, and I felt like I was being taken care of while I was dining in. 

This place is a must go if you are a sushi lover. If you don't like sushi, this place is also a must go to try their kitchen dishes!!"}
{"text":"Been in Cleveland for over a year now and biggest complaint I have about living here is... well the winter sucks.  But the lack of good to great sushi places are top 3 on my list (after the horrible roads).  Let me stop gripping about Cleveland and get to the food.  First and foremost, the quality of the fish probably the top 2 in Cleveland area.  Secondly, the prices to quantity ratio is outstanding... you will not have to stop by Rally's after your date.  Lastly, just great customer service.  You just can't beat great people, great service and great food."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! The gem of downtown. You can definitely taste the freshness of this sushi. You won't be disappointed by going here!"}
{"text":"I must say I was not impressed with Hanabi.  Stopped down for lunch on a rainy Wednesday and I was the only guest in the dining room, which is never a good sign for a restaurant, but especially not for a sushi bar.  Located in the Warehouse district, the decor is dark and unimpressive, with high ceilings and hardwood floors.  

Since I had a voucher from Living Social, I got the Age Tofu app and the Freedom Box lunch with shumei, shrimp tempura and a spicy tuna roll.  All of the food was competently prepared, but all the flavors seemed muted from what I expected. Of the items I tried the best items were the miso soup and the spicy tuna roll, but even then they were not as good as you can get at other places around town.  One other observation was that the shredded vegetable on the plate with the tofu, which I though was Daikon, was very bitter; next to the shumei were some bland room temperature vegetables.  It seems that they want to dress the plates up, but don't understand that these items should be flavorful as well.

Overall not a place I am planning on going back to."}
{"text":"Good tasting sushi on my first visit. 2nd visit, so so. I do not recommend their house udon noodles. The noodles were good, however, the meats were scarce and so dry/overcooked as were the vegetables, as I couldn't decipher what they were and when I asked what veggies were in this dish when ordered, she said it varied daily. I definitely recommend their sushi for freshness, quality and flavor. Excellent service! I'd go back for that alone. Also for their Wed. night 1/2 price sushi which she said was on all rolls and for carryout. Nice especially if you live downtown!"}
{"text":"Overrated.  I notice that the only other review lower than 4 stars is from a Manhattan NY resident. Maybe Ohio residents don't know what they're missing. Yes, the fish was fresh and good quality but there's so much more to running a successful restaurant than fresh fish.  On our visit, the tables, menus and floors were sticky and the bathroom was dirty (as in dusty and not being cleaned lately  by a cleaning service,not something a patron could have caused).  The avocado salad was edible but was mostly iceberg lettuce, and no attempt was made to garnish this salad or make it pleasing to the eye (we call this \"presentation.\")  For the same price, other sushi restaurants serve field greens and add color by garnishing their  salad with some of the following: grape tomatoes or sliced tomato, slivered red pepper, sesame seeds.  This salad was garnished with cucumber slivers, which is the same color as the lettuce! The waitress/hostess, who I suspect is the owner, is a nice person who seems eager to please.  But someone here needs to go to restaurant school!  Unless the locals don't know the difference and keep returning."}
{"text":"Those disappointed by Tomo rejoice!  The warehouse district has high quality sushi at last!  The menu is ambitious and striking.  It took us more than ten minutes to review their specialty rolls and narrow our choices down to three.  We tried the No-Name Roll, the Florida Roll, and the Dragon Roll and all three were superb.  We finished up with a \"chef's choice\" roll, and our chef chose what he called \"Temptation.\"  Absurdly delicious.  The cost was very manageable.  For four rolls, two miso soups and two hot teas, we paid less than $65 before tip.

Go.  Immediately."}
{"text":"Went here for half price sushi, that's right,  half price sushi, and it was dam good.

Spicy rainbow, amazing. Forgot the others but the we're all spicy and very good."}
{"text":"This was a great place! So many options! Seriously! Come here!!! If you like sushi, try it!!! The staff is so nice!!!"}
{"text":"So I got the chance to come to this lovely place during their half off rolls time but I didn't really want to do that, I enjoyed miso soup and one roll and was completely full with the ittis. The customer service was good, the service was fast, food was tasty and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Worst experience so far in Cleveland. The chef was cold and rude. The rolls were plain and have way too much rice. Sorry but I'm from California and I experienced much better in just a regular restaurant so with such a high-rating restaurant like Hanabi, I expected the average of California but it's not even there yet. I'll check out other sushi places in Cleveland and we'll see if this is the best we can get in town. But so far I won't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a road trip. Right near the football stadium. Quick service. Everything was delicious - we ordered 3 different rolls between 2 of us and it was plenty of food."}
{"text":"This is a flat-out excellent place. The decor is great, the food is fantastic and the service is outstanding. I've been here several times since it opened, always during dinner/happy hour. I have never had a single thing that wasn't top-notch. The servers are always extraordinarily friendly and welcoming.

The tuna and salmon are especially good, as are any of their specialty rolls. I once ate here within a week of returning from Tokyo and the sushi was comparable to what I had in Japan. You can't do any better than that."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night to Hanabi. This mom and pop sushi bar was kind of quiet. But then again the entire downtown was deserted. Hanabi features inventive American style complex maki rolls.  Their sushi rice is a little on the dry and bland side, but their fish is nice and fresh. We liked the white tuna maki best. Their spicy tuna was flavorful but I like a little more heat.  Overall, this is a good Sushi bar and worth a try. Recommend."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I drove to work in November-December, and saw a new Japanese restaurant opening. It was very exciting and when it finally opened I couldn't wait to try it! As someone who works downtown, finding different eats for after work or during lunch is something I'm always searching for.

The inside is very quiet and quaint, and the service here is absolutely amazing. The staff are extremely respectful, friendly, and always smiling, and because of this - I instantly get put into a warm and positive mood. 

Now I myself am not a fan of sushi, but colleagues and friends who I've come here with several times have tried the sushi and said it is absolutely amazing and they can't wait to come back!

I'm basic with my chicken, beef, vegetable dishes. Everything I've had here so far is absolutely delicious. Chicken Katsu is always my go-to. They have fantastic miso soup with a savory taste. I always try Gyoza (basically potstickers) at every Japanese restaurant I go to and Hanabi's was quite scrumptious. 

Other dishes I've had are the yaki udon, chicken teriyaki, udon soup, and vegetable tempura. 

It's a breathe of fresh air to have a Japanese restaurant that has a relaxing atmosphere vs. the hibachi establishments that are always so noisy and distracting.

A+ on this new addition to West 6th! I hope that the word gets out and they flourish with business. I know I will be sending friends and family to here any chance I can!"}
{"text":"Was a little scared when we walked up because it's a little ugly on the outside but it's a very nice atmosphere inside. The sushi was very fresh and delicious. We came at 5:30 and they have a happy hour where you buy 2 rolls and get the third free, which was a great deal. Meal was only 11$ and I'm full and satisfied. Hope to come back soon!"}
{"text":"So many great sushi options. I go to this place on many Saturdays because they do half off sushi. It's great for a date or to go with friends and family. The prices are very reasonable, especially when you do half off. It's in a convenient area in the warehouse district so you can always get dinner and then find a nearby bar to hang out at for the night. Definitely a must try for sushi lovers"}
{"text":"OMG! Sushi in Downtown Cleveland with no wait! Its a Christmas miracle! But for real, I truly enjoyed my sushi date at Hanabi. Bottom line, you know when you're eating unoriginal and poor sushi vs. creative and delicious. For its location, I was very surprised at how quiet and peaceful it was. We were sat immediately and served quickly.

The menu is HUGEEE (Donald Trump voice). My friend and I both stared at it for likely embarrassingly too long before we chose something. I had the avocado roll along with the fireball roll (deep fried spicy tuna with eel sauce and spice mayo) and the real crab roll (exactly how is sounds). The fireball roll was served slightly warm, and to be honest, it was one of my favorite sushi rolls i've ever had, anywhere. Super crave worthy. We also had a glass of the plum wine, which I understand is popular in Japan. Also worth getting a glass-- it was a sweet (literally) pre-cursor to our maki and special rolls.

Sure, the ambiance is just so-so, but you're coming for the reasonably priced sushi coma you secretly want. We ubered, but they have a few metered spots directly in front of the restaurant. Otherwise, several paid lots are throughout the Warehouse District. I will absolutely be back to Hanabi!"}
{"text":"Again 5 star food and service!  Ambiance is great!

A few rolls and the amazing BipBimbap....

Love Lucy, Little Bella, and Chad!   See you soon!"}
{"text":"Saw the good reviews and had to check this new Japanese place out.  As others have mentioned, this place is definitely run by Koreans.

The rolls - pretty good overall.  One note - they have pictures of all of the rolls, but what comes out is NOT the same as what is in the picture.  One of our rolls was slathered in yum-yum sauce (read: mayo), but the picture did not have any sauce on top.  We also had a naruto roll, where cucumber is used instead of nori, and a regular salmon roll.  Other than the roll that was covered in mayo, the rolls were pretty decent.  The fish was fresh, some of the rolls could have been cut more cleanly but whatever.

The gyoza dumplings - not bad, looked kind of emaciated but tasted fine.

The udon noodle soup - it was definitely very meh.  The noodles were cooked well but the chicken was bland and they really could have added more veggies/ingredients.  Also, the tempura shrimp that came with the noodles was not battered correctly - it was crunchy and thin, sort of like tempura shrimp that you would get from a mall food court.

Might come back here to try some of the Korean food and get a roll or two, but overall kind of underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Really good food. Not the fancy 20 dollar rolls, but typical sushi and kitchen food. Everything very fresh. Great flavors. The rice was seasoned perfectly and slightly warm, each of the grains separating in my mouth. Will come here again.,,,, soon!!"}
{"text":"I have never written a yelp review but after my experience at hanabi I had to! The atmosphere was great and the service was absolutely exceptional! We called ahead to make a reservation just in case but didn't really need one since it wasn't busy. We went on a Friday night. The sushi menu was extensive with a lot of creative options of both raw and cooked sushi rolls. Like another yelper said we had a hard time selecting from the menu because of all the great options on their signature rolls. We ended up getting the cucumber/avocado roll, the calamari roll, and the chicken tempura roll. The rolls came out on this cute wooden ship, which just added to the great experience. The menus had pictures of what the rolls looked like which is great for sushi beginners. The prices on the specialty rolls are an absolute steal ranging from $9-14. 

Overall were thrilled to have found this gem nestled away in the warehouse district. Will definitely come back here again and again. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good sushi is so hard to find in Cleveland and Hanabi is great! I've been here a few times and each hasn't been very busy (which is shocking) and we received awesome service. They have the perfect edamame, the rolls are super big and fresh, and I was really surprised with how fresh the sashimi was! With the speciality rolls costing about $10, you definitely get what you pay for and its worth it. If you are looking for good sushi, you have to come here!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good, not the best. It's a pretty large place but we were one of only 3 tables in there; however, it was a Monday at 5pm. The waitress Yi was very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"The sushi here is excellent. Previously, I tried it for takeout and wasn't a huge fan, but the sushi that we had tonight was great. I got the takeout early on so maybe there were some kinks to work out, but based on our experience we'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was great! And it was cheap. Waitress was attentive. Owner was awesome! Sit at the sushi bar and speak with the chef/owner. He is personable and an overall wonderful \"dinner host.\"  Good ambiance and cool location. Would definitely come back whenever we are back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"First of all: I'm a sushi snob so I am very picky with my sushi. I've had sushi everywhere including the west coast and east coast.... I LOVE HANABI!!!

They have the freshest sashimi, great selection and the service is fantastic. I have had almost all the rolls and have not been disappointed with a single one. Since we discovered it downtown, my friends and I come here all the time. We all appreciate great food, and this place is excellent. Great addition to the warehouse district!"}
{"text":"Sushi was really really good! I always get vegetarian sushi and it was really fresh and filling. I will be ordering from them again. My only complaint was that the soy sauce I was given was either low sodium or watered down, it was not very good at all but I got the good stuff at home so no worries."}
{"text":"Look, I should end my quixotic search for sushi on business trips (expense account and all), but being a healthy, I cannot help myself. Followed the reviews to come here  In short, its passable, but forgettable as well. The emphasis is on the myriad house rolls, which all seem to have some spicy component, or mayo. Experience suggests either not the best fish in that situation, or maybe not really tuna (tuna was really, really red). If you are into overworked rolls, and very large portions, then you will be happy. If you appreciate sushi for its subtly and simplicity, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am so happy that the Warehouse District finally has a delicious sushi restaurant. There are some other options, but nothing was close to how flavorful this is. We loved the yum yum roll and the temptation roll, and even the California roll was tasty. 

The service was so sweet and polite and very attentive. As much as I liked having all the attention on us, I hope more people catch on to how great this place is. I want it to succeed!"}
{"text":"I thought hanabi was actually pretty good.

After being disappointed by the sushis of sushi 86 and pacific east, I was hesitant to try this place... But just couldn't resist.

This place is right off of w6th, next to Barrocos. Both times I've gone in, it's been rather empty, but I think that's just because it's new.

It's a Japanese restaurant, but the owners and waitstaff are definitely Korean, and there are Korean items on the menu as well. They have an extensive list of sushi- complete with pics. I was pretty impressed at how extensive the list was and how many pictures came with it!

In terms of the sushi:
- good. The fish is fresh, and the quality of the fish is decent.
- presentation is fine too. Not the tightest presentation, but it's decent.

In terms of the udon: I really liked it. The hanabi special udon was excellent- coming out piping hot (I started sweating bc of it!) served with a side of lightly battered tempura. The broth to the udon was excellent though- not oily and didn't have that msg taste. It was perfect for the cold I was battling!

The waitstaff are very kind and constantly refilled our tea and water glasses. 

If you're ever downtown and looking for a good sushi place, definitely try hanabi! I think it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Their sushi menu is extensive so there's a roll for everyone. The female owner is amazingly sweet  and has by now memorized my order. When I go there I'm greeted like an old friend. OH! And the sushi is delicious! I crave it every week so I go almost every Wednesday when it's half off for 2 rolls."}
{"text":"Came here once when it just opened. I would say the price is more expensive than some other sushi places in downtown area such as Sapporo sushi, but the taste is not as good as theirs. The sushi rice is not fresh at all. Not sure if I came at a bad time or what. I will come back again to try."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing sushi. Best sushi I've had in Cleveland. Tried the Las Vegas, Real Crab, Orange and Fire rolls. Never had deep fried sushi before and it was so good. The staff are friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back. Especially in Wednesday's when it's half off all sushi!"}
{"text":"The lady who runs Hanabi is a sweet and charming woman. She has been running the show on each visit. The sushi is great. Not as excellent as she is. Her caring and pleasant demeanor is what keeps me coming back. Half off sushi on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Great rolls! Came in for Wednesday 1/2 price roll night. Perfect spot to hit before the Cavs game!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Thursday.   Their specialty rolls are NOT cheap - an average of $14.
The Red Dragon roll is phenomenal - so tasty. 

 I deducted a star b/c I felt very rushed by the woman waiting on me. I was only one of two people in the entire restaurant and i couldn't get a moment to myself w/o her coming up every moment.  Perhaps it was just helpfulness but it didn't feel comfortable"}
{"text":"It is a quiet, clean and comfortable place to have a quick meal. I enjoy the lunch set tho we stepped in quite late. I would be love to go again ."}
{"text":"After hearing over and over again that Cleveland has no good sushi, I was quite surprised to come across Hanabi. They have a really large selection of rolls and of course all the sushi/sashimi you want. Their appetizer list is also quite extensive with dumplings, salads, and ponzu tuna. Buuuuut....they also have a kani salad AND a nuruto roll. It was my first time there but I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The fish here is spelled with a capital F-R-E-S-H. They sure can make their ambiance better but if you don't care too much about that and you're more of a foodie than anything else, this is your jam. I always get takeouts from here, if not ubereats. The owner remembers my orders and the way I like it. This kind of service is getting rarer by the day. I would not judge it so much by the outlook and give this gem a shot. 

Food to try: sashimi dinner platter, yaki udon (ask for spicy if you dare), unagi don, calamari roll, spicy girl roll, seaweed salad, miso soup"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited for lunch for half priced sushi Wednesday. After being ignored for 5-10 minutes, we placed our orders, two rolls each. Only the spider roll was anything more than a very basic roll. It took 40 minutes, with very little interaction with staff, until we finally got our food, by which time, we both had to leave to return to work. When I finally ate it, my Alaskan roll and spider roll were average to below average. I am a white suburban woman and I demand more respect and better service!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Definitely recommend it to anyone in the area looking to get sushi/Japanese food."}
{"text":"So glad to add Hanabi to our sushi rotation! The selection, presentation, service, and quality of the miso soup, house design rolls, and sushi dinner was excellent! My fiancé and I are always looking for tasty sushi and after catching a show downtown, Hanabi was a pleasant trial. Will definitely be back! 

Perhaps it was the rainy weather or the fact that their lunch and carryout options are more popular, but we had the place to ourselves, which I highly doubt is a refelection of the service/food."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with a friend. It was great! Awesome sushi and saki! our waitress was so sweet she gave us 10% off for next time we come in! It is so so reasonably priced. Every big roll was $11 or under! I'll be back !!"}
{"text":"Ever since Hanabi opened and my coworker let me try his carry out lunch, I wanted to pay them a visit. Sadly, I finally made it there right before moving out of Cleveland. I'm glad I did- because the service, food, ambiance, etc was absolutely on point! I just wish I was close enough to visit more often!

Like I said, service was great! The lady helping us was so friendly, accommodating to everyone in the party (my friend wanted to make her veggie sushi into her own creation with the smoked mozz on top and some other additions.. Right before closing.. And she was more than ok with doing this), and very fast and efficient. The sushi was delicious! We tried the Diablo roll and crunchy philly and my oh my- the Diablo is phenomenal !! That smoked mozzarella sounds weird on a sushi roll but absolutely tastes wonderful!!

We went late on a weeknight, so that may have contributed to the great service, but I hope this is how they are all the time! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Got a living social deal for this place with the intent to get sushi wasted. Mission accomplished. Split the sashimi dinner and a spicy rainbow roll between myself and my Bae. Happy I brought my muumuu dress. Generous size portions of sashimi (21 pieces for $28) some of pieces I had to eat in 2-3 installments. Dinner only comes with Miso soup but she let me substitute for a salad. Ginger dressing was very fresh, requested another bowl of dressing actually. Kinda empty in here though. Perhaps a happy hour with some shi-shi foo-foo drinks may add to the allure"}
