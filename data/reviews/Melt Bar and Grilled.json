{"text":"Definitely worth the detour off of 80 to get some food. They have a huge beer and grilled cheese selection. The main reason for visiting is that they have vegan options here. My friends loved the mushroom grilled cheese. I ordered the buffalo \"chicken\" grilled cheese and found that there was way too much blue cheese. I asked for more buffalo sauce to counter the overpowering blue cheese. Unfortunatlely I got charged ($0.50) for it. The sandwiches use incredibly thick bread and are quite greasy. Though the greasiness should be expected... Friendly service and good (greasy) food."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places I have ate at in a very long time. Food was beyond amazing. Would drive from anywhere in the world for one of there sandwiches. People there were extremely nice and extremely helpful with choosing what to get."}
{"text":"4 stars instead of 5 because there is always a crazy long wait.  Other than that this place is fantastic. Sandwiches are HUGE, yummy and original. Go with an empty stomach! To avoid the insane wait you can order to go."}
{"text":"Can't get enough! Vegan and love this place but it does prove that vegan isn't always healthy ;)"}
{"text":"Dude Abides!!!  Amazing meal, won't be hungry for 24 hrs after eating here.  They want me to write more, but nothing else needs to be said.  Outstanding sandwiches, a pound of French fries and a substantial beer menu make this one of my favorite indulgences when traveling to Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is my favorite guilty pleasure restaurant.  I have been to every Melt location and was ecstatic when the Mentor location opened since we are now just down the street from one!  The ambiance is tacky and fun, and I love the record sleeve menus.  They have a great beer selection that changes quite frequently.  The portions are huge...definitely enough for at least two meals.  I typically replace the fries and/or coleslaw with soup (LOVE the buffalo chicken chowder) or salad.  I actually don't order the sandwiches on the regular menu very often b/c I usually get the special sandwiches.  They have a special each month and, once in a while, they will have a special weekend sandwich to honor an old movie showing at one of the local movie theaters at midnight.  Unfortunately, those are usually my favorite sandwiches, BUT they have been known to bring back the favorites!  On the regular menu, my favorites are the Rising Sun Melt and the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken (the blue cheese slaw is incredible).  Of the monthly specials, my favorites are the Hungry Hungarian (January) and New Bomb Turkey (November).  The staff is wonderful.  They are always friendly, helpful, and great with recommendations if you aren't sure what beer to get or how to make your sandwich your own with add-ons.  My husband and I are frequent Melt patrons and are rarely disappointed.  I definitely recommend any of the locations if you are in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally good bartender service. Great beer selection. And sandwiches that you can't (or shouldn't) finish. Fun times. Recommend."}
{"text":"I visit Cleveland regularly, and I've been to this Melt twice. I have been delighted both times and will definitely insist on going back every time I'm in town.  The sandwiches are to die for. Yes, there's a lot of bread, but the bread and fillings are excellent. I mean, they have lasagna in a sandwich - crazy and delicious. Or how about a bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwich? And the portions are huge - plan on taking half of your sandwich home for an awesome leftovers meal.   The beer selection is great. Not phenomenal, but definitely worth writing home about. They've got lots of beer on tap (at least 23 if memory serves) and some really great big names on tap (Rogue Dead Guy Ale! Stone Arrogant Bastard!), as well as a big list of bottles.  And if you ask me, the huge number of seat-yourself bar seats is a big plus. Both times we have been able to seat ourselves immediately right at the bar. Sitting at the bar is great here - easy access to the beers, three TVs per side, and honestly a little more intimate and conversation-friendly than tables.  Definitely give it a shot, but if you can do a late lunch or early dinner (2-4 PM) - the place fills up fast at peak hours."}
{"text":"Hype. If you could clear away the kitchen, food and all the ink this would be a Great bar. The list of draft specials is stupendous and the quality of those pours (particularly at happy hour prices) is nearly as good as one can get.   However, and this is significant, the kitchen is here to stay, producing some awesome hits and some awful blows but more than anything dire frustration.  Apparently, the \"Point\" of this place is to be a sort of \"lifestyle\" event as opposed to something resembling traditional restaurant service.  The staff is the most ill trained around and you will WAIT for as much as a napkin, not to mention food or drink. Sitting at the bar (precluding family and, specifically, children) is the ONLY option and even then even if the place is all but empty you can expect to wait a good 5 minutes or more for someone to offer to get you a beverage. The only person with both relevant service industry experience coupled with the old fashioned belief that the customer is first and right seems to be some chap with experience in the airline industry - which sorta makes sense, because when I'm at Melt the experience is very much Like being trapped on a jet stranded on the tarmac- if only the government's three hour rule applied here."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last week with a work friend.  Barely had to wait, but that's absolutely not the case at dinner time.  The last time we had a friend that wanted to try it, there was a 3 hour wait time  ...that means some idiots agreed to wait 2hr and 45min!!!!!??  Though this place has undeniably good sandwiches, nothing is worth the ridiculous wait.  So now they're opening up a couple more restaurants, which makes sense, but also brings forth a cheesy franchise type ambiance.  Tough dilemma.  If I was the owner, I would have opened up more of the almost-same restaurants with slightly different names so they could each offer the same staple meals with a bit of uniqueness.  Note to self:  If I ever open a restaurant, give it a name that follows some kind of theme in case it blows up and I have to make more."}
{"text":"I have been here twice with my mother, who had Alzheimer's, and the staff, including the kitchen staff, has been absolutely wonderful. My mom orders a special sandwich and she loves it! She said \"compliments to the chef\" and a chef came out to thank her and she was delighted. Thank you for making her day and making the food and experience one we will keep coming back for again and again."}
{"text":"I've lived in Cleveland now for almost 6 years and it's taken me this long to visit Melt. Actually that's not entirely true. Twice now I've attempted to go but due to insanely long waits and random closures (Yes, I went to take a friend there it and was closed - for a vacation for the employees), I've yet to enjoy.   However a few weeks ago my roommate to me for my birthday. We went early, as to ensure we would not have to wait in the ridiculous line, and were seated right away.   Our server, whose name I wish I could remember, was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. He made recommendations for me, the first timer, and made sure we had adequate time to decide between the delicious sandwiches. He was a really great server.   I went with the \"Dude Abides\" and my roommate the special of the month. Both sandwiches were enormous, with meat/cheese/sauce pouring out the sides. They were fantastic! Seriously, super delicious.   So if you haven't tried Melt yet, I suggest you do."}
{"text":"The wait is long, but arguably worth it, even on a Sunday around 1pm it took 45 mins to be seated.  Above Avg bear selection and my wife had a pear cider (unique).  We had grilled cheese, reuben, and the spinach and cheese sandwich.  All were large, tasted great, and not too expensive.  I enjoyed the unique atmosphere and the bar decor.  I'd definitely eat here again.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We saw this place on both Man vs. Food and Food Paradise: Cheese Paradise and knew we had to give it a try when we were passing through town.  The one word that comes to mind immediately after entering Melt Bar & Grilled is \"kitch.\" There are big plastic Santas and big plastic bunnys and all kinds of other holiday decorations and memorabilia all over the place. Then there's the huge Dairy Queen sign and much, much more. When you're seated, your menu is printed on the back of a record album cover. Kitch. But in a good way.  If you can't find a \"grown up\" grilled cheese to select from the menu, you're just being too picky. Even as a somewhat picky eater, I found plenty to choose from. My wife and I definitely weren't up to The Melt Challenge (over 5 pounds of cheese, bread, and more) and decided to split a Wake & Bacon (fried eggs, bacon, and cheese) and a Westside Monte Cristo (honey ham, smoked turkey, swiss, and american battered and deep fried). We also ordered a Melt Pierogi on the recommendation of the server.  We're certainly not pierogi experts, but we enjoyed Melt's version as a nice starter before our sandwiches came out.  When our sandwiches were delivered, both my wife and I were amazed at the amount of food. Along with the hand cut fries and sweet slaw, our sandwich plates were overflowing with food.  Bite after bite, both of us enjoyed our sandwiches. They were both as advertised and were a nice, grown-up version of the all-American favorite grilled cheese.  Honestly, we don't know what the slaw tasted like. By the time we finished our sandwiches and a good amount of our fries, we just didn't have room to eat any more food. For the price, the amount of food is a ridiculously good value. College students could easily get 3 or 4 meals out of a single plate.  The only downside to Melt Bar & Grilled is the parking situation. It's a bit confusing if you're not from the area. We parked on the road at a meter (after hours) and were fine, but there are a ton of parking rule signs you have to read to make sure you're okay. Thankfully, the reading was worth it for the food!"}
{"text":"I love this place I've been here five or six times and the food is always incredible but the décor Is innovative.  the staff is amazing . I'm all about it!"}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Not as good as expected after some of these reviews.   Service was terrible at 3pm on Monday afternoon when the restaurant was half empty."}
{"text":"Melt is awesome, but plan on splitting you sandwich with a friend (or taking half of it home) - these things are HUGE. If you're not in a cheesy mood, the vegetarian chili is also very tasty, and has a bit of a kick to warm you up on cold winter nights.   The Independence location is a bit different than the Cleveland Heights and Lakewood versions. It has a much more open feel, with low walls and very little room to stand around the bar. The decor seems more 'organized' than at the other locations.. not bad, just different. I was here on a beautiful Friday afternoon for happy hour, and the crowd didn't show up until a little after 6."}
{"text":"I absolutely love going out to eat at Melt.  I have never had a sandwich that I did not enjoy, and I usually find myself eating till I'm sick because I just don't want to stop eating the delicious things piled on my plate.  It's a very good value you get a lot of food for your dollar.  I love the young alternative atmosphere, and how relaxed the establishment feels.  The only complaint I have is something that Melt cannot control.  Every time I go there, there is always some adult there acting live they've never gone to a restaurant before.  The most recent time there was a rude lady on the patio giving our waiter a hard time. (Shout out to Ray for keeping his cool with a grumpy customer!)    A manager came over (I didn't catch her name, but a lovely tall young woman wearing a maxi-dress) and I think she pleased the grumpy customer.  From what I overheard the grumpy lady was not happy with her seasoned fries (She's wrong, they're delicious), however refused to have them be re-made with less seasoning (She was probably just complaining to try to get something for free.)  I also heard grumpy lady complaining about the \"weird\" cole-slaw.  (Apparently the only kind she's ever had has been drowning in mayonnaise.)  Melt's signature slaw is awesome, relatively dry with hints of vinegar and black pepper.  It is crisp and clean, a  great complement to superbly salty seasoned fries, and a savory gormet grilled cheese.  If you don't like Melt's food then you need to get out, because they're awesome, and you're wrong.  Seriously, Melt is great"}
{"text":"I used to love going to Melt. The food is mostly good, but there's something that's happened in each of my last 10 visits: my fries have been served at room temperature. I have to ask them to heat them up or get me new ones every time. It's not that big of a hassle; I'm just tired of that being part of my Melt experience. My wife and I used to go every week. Because of the fries (maybe a sign of bigger issues?), we now only go when we're tired of the other restaurants in the area. So we're down from 50+ visits a year to 4 or 5. The Melt on the east side used to have the same issue. It went away when there was a great manager there briefly. Maybe the Lakewood Melt manager just needs to be told that this is an issue? Anyway, visits are usually great, aside from that. That's just a semi-deal-breaker for my wife and I."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing. The food. The staff. The vibe. The cocktails. Amazing. Due to this place being popular and famous.... there will be a wait. If you don't want to wait, go right when they open (I have been at least 3 times right when they open and got in right away or with a small wait and everything is still great) or go before close.   Please. Get the Grilled cheeses. This is what they are known for. My friend had a veggie burger and was disappointed. If you are vegetarian or vegan, many of their grilled cheese sandwiches can be made this way. Check out the menu!   Their seasonal cocktails are awesome. My favorites have been the pumpkin ones!   I have not had a bad sandwich. I have tried the Turkey Bomb (Seasonal), Macaroni Melt (Seasonal), Gyro Melt, Westside Monte Cristo, The Dude Abides, The Parmageddon, Big Popper and Grilled Peanut Butter and Banana. I have never been disappointed.   The sandwiches are HUGE! I always take half home and half the fries (everything has heated up great in my toaster oven -- and I am usually not a fan of left overs... let alone re-heated fries!)  Side note - their ranch dressing is soooo good!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and have many vegan and vegetarian options. The beer list is great! They now started doing half sandwiches which is fantastic but I still tend to get the full and bring half home for lunch the next day. Staff was all very nice."}
{"text":"Fucking shit customer service. Have very little respect for the customer, as they are so confident with the massive crowds of undiscerning college students. What a joke! Is this supposed to be a \"trendy location.\" Please."}
{"text":"Great sandwhiches.  Prices are reasonable. Only downside is that it is hard to get a table."}
{"text":"i was really looking forward to melt, but came away just thinking it was ok.  maybe i'm not enough of a grilled cheese aficionado.  (and i didn't partake of the beer - but i plan to next time.)  since all reviews seem to mention the wait, we went right at 11:30am saturday.  smart move, as we got probably the last open table.  everyone after us waited, for quite some time.  i thought it was great that the service was not rushed at all, even with the people waiting.  it was just pleasant and chill, which is i guess what happens when most people think it's worth the wait.  our server was also really on top of the refills and making sure we were happy.  we started with the pierogi.  it was fine, but kind of bland i thought.  i had the lake erie monster, because i love some walleye.  the bread was scrumptious, and the cheese was good, but then when you add the fish in, i think it was just too much.  the fish was 2x the size of the rest of the sandwich, and basically by the end of the meal, my plate looked like a massacre occurred.  seriously messy.  and just sort of too heavy.  i know grilled cheese is heavy, but this was just too much.  my friend got the bratwurst (municipal stadium?) and said it was ok, but likewise just thought it was way too much.  we both liked the fries though, crispy and salty.  and i loved the pickles and slaw, which helped cut the heaviness with some crisp freshness.  all in all, i do plan to go back.  but i think i will be a purist next time and just get the kindergardener with tomato soup.  maybe you shouldn't mess with a classic."}
{"text":"Upon going there on a Friday at 12:30, I was expecting a wait. It was a 2 hour wait, though, so we got it to go. This was a good decision. The food was absolutely delicious. My wife had the Turkey Bomb thingy and loves it. I had the Monte Cristo and love it. We had the Fried Twinkies and loved it. The food was very plentiful as we both only ate half of our sammich. A must stop if you are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"If your appetite is big, I definitely suggest these monster-sized sandwiches! The Thanksgiving sandwich we had in November was top-notch. That being said, be prepared to wait nearly 45 minutes if you come in during the dinner time rush and on weekends!"}
{"text":"The food is enormous, delicious, and well priced but unfortunately it is always insanely crowded and the dining room is not very big. Be prepared for a 30min-1hr wait time."}
{"text":"What can I say about Melt that hasn't already been said?  A few years ago on my 21rst birthday I went to the Lakewood location- this was back before Melt was a real hot spot- it was the only location and you could go in on any night and not have to wait forever.  It was a Tuesday night and they had run out of bread...no joke.  They made me a quesadilla with spinach, feta, and bacon.  Needless to say, the experience left me wanting.  I've been there countless times since then and each time has never been a disappointment.  I know what I'm going in for- a colossal grilled cheese with interesting ingredients.  Yes, it is a little pricy considering, but it is a lot of food.  Each month they have a special sandwich, or every weekend they might have a special coinciding with the movie that is showing at the Cedar Lee or the Capitol.  My favorite sandwich is the special they have for the month of November- the bomb turkey.  It's Thanksgiving in a grilled cheese: turkey, stuffing, squash, gravy and a cranberry dipping sauce.  Heaven on Earth.  Another popular one is the popper melt which is cream cheese and jalapenos, entirely deep fried and served with the same cranberry sauce.  They had another special once called the six degrees of Kevin Bacon melt which was like ten kinds of bacon stuffed between bread and I will remember it always.  My favorite location is Independence.  It's bigger than the Lakewood one and the decorations are cool(lots of Cleveland pride stuff, and old school, light up holiday decorations).  The beer list is phenomenal and they have some awesome seasonal cocktails.  Defiantly worth a try once, but it won't change your life, contrary to popular opinion."}
{"text":"I love Melt! Every time I've gone there I've had a phenomenal experience. Everyone is always friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere is fun and casual. They have a really awesome new menu layout and a ton of delicious sandwiches. I personally like to take the Kindergardner Sandwich and put pepperjack cheese, pepperoni and jalapenos on it with sour cream on the side. Plus if you can't finish it the sandwiches taste just as good if you take them home and heat them on a skillet. I already have plans to get a Melt tattoo :D!"}
{"text":"Good food, only downside is the wait. Going for lunch during work is nearly impossible considering the 1hr+ wait for a table. Their twist on grilled cheese is very unique and they have something for almost everyone's taste. However I do not like the first come first serve policy, you should be able to make a reservation to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"I agree with Chris S' 11/29 review that the service is very slow.  We arrived at ~6 on a Saturday and was told that it would be 1 1/2 to 2 hour wait.  The wait was about 1 1/4 hours, and could have been quicker, but the staff was very slow at seating people as tables became available.  We had the Blackened Chicken and Mom's Meatloaf sandwiches, both of which were very good.  We never had grilled sandwiches like this before with the thick bread and  the amount of cheese.  The fries and cole slaw were good, too.  Although we really enjoyed the meal, it was far too much food.  I was surprised that we had to ask them to change channels on one of the TVs so that we could watch the Cavs game.  We will definitely go back next time we are in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Go early to avoid the wait.  The 45 min wait was telling for a Sunday night.  But I had been traveling for 8 hours and up since 3 AM.  So... my patience was thin.  The food was excellent as usual and the atmosphere is always fun.  I recommend sharing a sandwich or be prepared to get a to go box."}
{"text":"So we heard about this place and decided to stop by. First visit the wait was 1.5 hours so we decided to spit and come back another time. Went back the next day (Sunday) and the wait time was down to 20 minutes which isn't bad. After what seemed like more than 20 minutes we were seated in the bar area and ordered some drinks. It was right around shift change time I guess because our server informed us she was leaving, and that another server would be taking care of us. No problem we thought.  The next server eventually stopped by and took our food order. After what seemed like 45 minutes our food arrived. The food looked and tasted great, so no problem there, but our server didn't bother to ask of offer to bring us more drinks or refills, etc. After awhile she did come around and ask but we were almost finished eating.   The place is neat and has a good vibe and all that, but over all the service was slow that day. There are two other locations, so maybe a visit to them is in order?   The concept of huge grilled cheese sandwiches with tons of ad on options is great. Plenty of things to please almost any palate. The fresh cut fries are very good and you get plenty of them. I had the version with chorizo and potatoes. It was large and tasty.   They do have a huge and I mean huge beer selection here which is a plus. There is an entire menu page devoted to beers. I had the Great Lakes Burning River which I liked.   I'd consider going back, but maybe one of the other locations."}
{"text":"Had Good Burger.  Its a huge sandwich.  Place was crowded, had to wait a short while to find seating.  Polite staff.  Casual pub."}
{"text":"There seem to be two opinions in every review thus far: great food but less then average service. I'll keep up the trend...   I went down to Melt a few weeks ago after hearing good things from locals about the concept of a grilled cheese eatery and the food was quite tasty. Thick Texas-style toast along with whatever types of cheese and toppings you could want. Yummy! They also have an interesting choice of appetizers and sides. For those who like a good sandwich, Melt is a definite must eat.  Yet at the same time, there are negatives to this place. The first is what the other reviewers have hinted at - the wait (You can pretty much expect somewhere between 45-1hr). On the night I went one entire side of the joint was filled with empty tables that I was told I could sit in while I waited. Well thanks, but it'd be much better if I could be sitting here ordering / eating since you've got the space. I don't know why, given how popular this place has become, that they don't just hire more staff and keep the entire place open.   The other complaint I had was the price. I made a custom sandwich, but it was pretty much just a cheesy BLT . I also ordered a beer and a vegetable side. The beer ( $8 - an oatmeal stout) was on their \"big/specialty\" menu, so I expected a generous pour, but instead received about a half a glass. The vegetable side was also $6 on its own; they thankfully let me substitute for cole slaw, but that option wasn't on the menu so most might not know about it. For all this (not that much) my bill was about $23.  So while I love the food here, the prices and the long wait make it an occasional treat at best."}
{"text":"I live in CA and especially make a point of visiting here each time I come \"home\" to visit for the holidaze. I love the uniqueness of this place. From the vibe when you walk in (yes always a wait so don't complain, deal with it) to the inclusion of local loves (hello pierogies!) and using old \"albums\" as menus (a lovely memory lane for those of us that remember the treasures that albums provided). The music is always playing something fun and the service is really good. But really it's about the food. Bring your appetite here and it will be satisfied. Everything is a large portion and you definitely get value for what you receive. Agree it is a place you indulge and don't even think about counting calories, because you really don't want to know. Grilled macaroni and cheese? Come on, you know you are in for a button popper! Love this place, cozy, warm and inviting. Just what I like the most about coming \"home\". And remember you don't HAVE to eat it all, you can take 1/2 your portion home. Great place to go with the family and friends. And don't forget being a local place, their selection of beers includes over the holidays they have the local Christmas ale that is so high in demand on tap. Encouraged :)"}
{"text":"If you're in Cleveland, you have to go to Melt. It's a rule.  The menu has changed for the worse over the last few years, but it still towers above all competitors. Every possible option is big, delicious, and distinctly local. The staff is fantastic (after a handful of visits, they started calling my wife and I by name), and the food is both distinctly American and urbanely weird.  Expect it to be busy, but give it a visit. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was told that Melt is a must-try if in Cleveland, and I now know why.  A great variety of huge sandwiches, hand-cut fries and other sides. We stopped in at around 2 pm, and the place was still packed!  I wanted to try a vegan option, so I ordered the Good Burger, a homemade veggie burger and found it very tasty.  The only thing I didn't care for was the vegan mozzarella, which I knew was a throw of the dice (I've yet to find a decent fake cheese), but it didn't detract much from the sandwich. If I order this burger in the future, it will be sans-fake cheese, or I'd go for real mozzarella.  They had several other vegetarian and vegan options, so you've got plenty of choices, all of which sounded good. On the meat side, my associate ordered a half sandwich of the Hot Italian, and it looked really good, and he devoured it. Overall, I liked what I ordered, and the variety of sandwiches and sides available.  Service was good, but not particularly noteworthy, so not much to say there.   If you enjoy sandwiches, I would definitely give Melt a try!"}
{"text":"The original location of Melt is on Detroit Avenue in Lakewood, and it got so popular that they built one on the East side as well.  Let me warn you: it's always busy. Go here for innovation and creativity, not gourmet-ness. The decor is interesting, and I love their menu/branding art. This restaurant is recieving national attention and while most people are just ga-ga over it, there are some who walk in with great expectations and leave without them having been met.  Anyways, my friend and I got our sandwich to go (thus avoiding the wait), took it to the park and split it. It was plenty of food for both of us. The Monte Cristo is DELICIOUS! The fries are just OK. I've got pictures and a link to the menu on my blog (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/07/melt-bar-and-grilled-lakewood.html) if you're curious."}
{"text":"The fried mac and cheese, in my opinion is an absolute must. And the cheese they provide to dip it in! WOW. Too good. The fried pickles too. The remoulade they have for dipping those in is divine as well. Very, very good."}
{"text":"went here tonite with my family for my dad's birthday he was so excited to try the new place on the corner  was he excited to wait 1 hour and 1/2 with horrible service? I don't think so as well as being SO loud where you can't even hear the person next to you ? I think not and the food.. nothing to wait that long for..  I don't recommend wasting your time in this BAR. it's NOT a restaurant"}
{"text":"Really great bufflalo soup!  I will always come back to this place.  I drove all the from the youngstown for failure...Good stuff!  I love how fast the food comes out.  Usually 30 min - an hour.  But its hot and always delicious!  My son loves the eggplant sandwich and my husband loves the same exact thing.  I love you...."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this establishment and I was thoroughly impressed. I looked for an hour for a good food joint close to my hotel and settles on this one. Glad I did.  The wait staff were extremely helpful and pleasant, seating me right away and getting my drink faster than I could have myself. The waitress was willing to discuss the various brew options on tap and recommended the beer of the month, an English porter. It was quite enjoyable.   My appetizer arrived promptly and was certainly more than I could eat myself. I did have to wait a while for my Cleveland cheese steak. But no more so than most any other restaurant.   A cheese steak sandwich is as much about the marriage of meat a day cheese as it is an expression of the local community that creates it. In this case I only cared about the  cheesy and beef. And there was plenty of each. It could have been served hotter, but was just fine so long as I started eating right away.   Well done Melt. Well done."}
{"text":"We went to the Melt in Independence, Ohio and were very disappointed. The bread was too greasy and I could not taste the sandwich. I had the cuban melt and the ham and the pulled pork was tasteless. Even the fries were tasteless and disappointing. The restaurant was packed and there was a long wait, but honestly I don't understand why. The tomato soup had the consistency and taste of marinara sauce. The staff was friendly but their system clearly could not handle the crowd. As we waited and waited, we could see empty tables some bussed some clear with a crowd waiting to be called.  I would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"The Monte Cristo is the best I've ever had...and could have fed two people easily.  Hip place has menu on the back of classic albums."}
{"text":"I've been to the mayfield location of melt many times, and the Mentor location brings the same warmth and unique style, as well as great food and service. I sat at the bar to avoid a wait and I was immediately greeted by scott, who had a vast knowledge of the spirits on tap. My martini was quickly served as well as the Melt quesadilla. Both were exceptionally good! I will be having drinks there regularly!"}
{"text":"Casual, comfortable, and the food is excellent! Best sandwiches I've had, period. better than the gonzo burger or Aloysius from st Augustine....better than Chuck Liddell from Belize....take your family, always a good time"}
{"text":"ahh the venerable melt, the stuff of conversions and wild challenges. This place Is everything you've ever wanted from an american bar/restaurant. With great atmosphere and almost all tasty grilled cheese creations, you'll secondly definitely be coming back for more. Only downside is that you'll probably need to wait a really long time for your seat."}
{"text":"The food is excellent but the kitchen is slow and there's always a massive line. Be prepared to spend 90 minutes or more between waiting and eating your lunch during peak hours. That being said, it's totally worth it if you have the time. The Smokey Russian and Monte Cristo are my favorites and seem to be pretty popular overall. Melt will show you how good a lunch sandwich can really be."}
{"text":"Although I think Melt is fun place with fun food, and the wait staff is great, it's just not my thing. The portions are gluttonous and the food is fatty -- cheese, french fries, lots of butter. A 2 hour wait is an eternity with a child, and just not worth it for this menu. I wish the Melt team all the success in the world. You can't please everyone."}
{"text":"I get it... It's a cool concept and hipster-ish place that is trending.   The food is good if you are able to stomach an entire sandwich I think you should get an award, the sandwiches are huge!   People rave about this place, I just does not send me over the top. I am not into huge portioned meals.  I give it a 3 because it works for everyone.   They really do need to consider a bigger location though, apparaently the wait is always long at this place.   Wish I had more details to share.. try it out is all I have to say, be prepared to wait for a table!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to wait two - three hours to eat anywhere. The times I have gotten in I thought it was ok. I'm super stoked for the owner as I know he is a good guy and deserves the success. I just don't have four plus hours to kill for dinner."}
{"text":"First, how cool is the concept of a grilled cheese restaurant?!  Second, the decor is awesome.  We sat at our table and just kept looking around at all the cool stuff on the walls.  Third, the service is top notch.  We were greeted immediately and the hostess was very friendly and our waiter was great (side note: I think it's a requirement to have a beard to work here - every guy in the place had one!).  Finally, the food was delicious.  Thick bread that was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside filled with lots of gooey, melty cheese (we had the Kindergartner with American) and the seasoning on the fries was perfection.  We will definitely be back the next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"The menu is sure to have something to your liking and once served I am positive that you will be pleased.  The service is great, servings are plentiful and tasty, and i dig the atmosphere here.  The philly cheese was my choice and I cannot wait to try it again.  You will have fun here and enjoy great food!!"}
{"text":"Busy but generally good, usually a couple of spots at the bar....my review is apparently too short for yelp, so here is an extra sentence for nothing"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars only because of the October dessert, Harvest Spice bread pudding, which you must try!!  Visited here on a Saturday night and it was busy but slowly died down after 7:30ish.  Service was terribly slow and the waitress seemed a little \"dizzy\", I had to keep asking for water even though she kept walking by and could see our entire table had no water.  I would go back out of curiosity of what the monthly specials are.  Don't bother with the Buffalo chicken soup, it was not good and tasted old.   Good place to go since it was on Man v Food and you can say you've been there."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked into this place, it gave off a very cool and hip vibe...which always makes me uncomfortable as I am far from cool and hip. The counter to give your name isn't directly by the door and we weren't quite sure if we were to walk over there or if it was where people just paid their checks. A little confusing, but we were waved over and given our \"name\" that they would call us by. Styx. Good enough.  The wait was maybe 20 minutes. Not too bad. The main seating area of the restaurant is to the right when you walk in the front door. There is sort of a half wall separating it from the waiting area. But the weird part is that there is another little seating area to the left when you walk in the front door. It has maybe 6 or 8 tables over there. So while sitting in the waiting area, you are kind of just staring at people who are eating in that little space. I just kept thinking \"I hope we aren't seated over there\"...but we were. Then we had lots of people waiting staring at us while we ate. I don't think the staring is necessarily in judgment or anything negative...but people just want to see how other people eat these massive sammiches.   We all ordered different sandwiches. My brother ordered their special for that week and it cost him $17 bucks. I found that a bit ridiculous. Special or not, dude paid 17 bucks for a sandwich. When our food arrived we were all very excited. The sandwiches were gigantic and there was a decent size helping of fries and coleslaw as well.  The fries were nicely seasoned and anyone who is anyone knows that fries are the first thing you take a bite of when you get your plate and they set the mood for the rest of the meal. Right? Maybe? Anyways, we all took a bite of our fries and nodded to one another in an unspoken agreement of their deliciousness.  To the sandwiches!! They were quite delicious. I'm one of those annoying adults who goes to a restaurant and orders grilled cheese and fries off the kids menu because I love grilled cheese so much. So there was no way I wasn't going to love this place. There was a good 15 minutes of silence while we stuffed our faces with calories. We all held our full bellies and looked down at our plates...HAD WE NOT EATEN ANYTHING?! Nay. We had all eaten but half of our sandwiches. Half of our fries. Half of our coleslaw. Suddenly, all of the leftover boxes that EVERY person in the place was taking home with them made sense. We all packed our left over boxes with enough food to count as a second meal. And even though we were all full to our limit's we had to have a deep fried Twinkie. Between the four of us, we each only got about two bites so it wasn't too much, but it was super tasty.   If there was one of these places up here in Detroit, I'd probably be a regular."}
{"text":"I have to give The Melt five stars due to the uniqueness of the food and atmosphere.  My sandwiches and fries have always been good, although my husband isn't as impressed.  I enjoy going here a few times/year - fun experience!"}
{"text":"Super Yummy food, the wait staff was friendly although a little slow. The food and décor totally made up for it. Glad I was able to experience this place on my visit to Ohio."}
{"text":"I get why people like this place. Huge portions, and a great beer selection.This place is basically a frat bar, and if I was still twenty, and needed to pack away a few thousand calories for a few bucks, then yes, I could see the appeal. I wouldn't even care about some of the worst service in Cleveland--and I've been to three of the outlets.  But if you know anything about food, the heavy handed coarse nature of this blurred out and nondescript food makes you wonder how terribly underexposed the American palate is. What is even more offensive is the positive press it's received from some news outlets.   So I am really glad a local boy found a spot for himself, made good and made some money. He doesn't need me to sell this place--they are always busy. And that's just as well, cause if my opinion counted, I'd have them sell the place..."}
{"text":"People that believe Melt is outstanding have zero clue what great food is all about.  This place is a glorified greasy spoon.  The sandwiches are greasy -- laden with so much better.  The French fries are burnt and greasy.  I tried this place twice and I will never go again.  Spend your time and money at other fab restaurants in town."}
{"text":"The most outrageous sandwich combinations I have every seen. The food is a must have, portions are well worth the price. A little loud and crap for my liking. expect a wait if going in the evening no matter what day of the week it is."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever! I live in Maryland and I make the trip to Cleveland just to come to melt as often as I can. The Cleveland cheesesteak is to die for. The Backyard BBQ is delicious and the Cuban Pig War is one of the best Cuban sandwiches I've had. My husband loves the Kindergartener sandwich! Awesome place, great food, great beer selection and awesome friendly service. If your in Cleveland, it's a must to eat at Melt!"}
{"text":"This is just to chime in with others to say that Melt worked out the kinks of the early days, and while you still do sometimes wait a long time for a table (hey: that's because everyone wants to come here) you no longer wait an unreasonable time after placing your order. The beer list is inspired; the sandwiches are devilishly delicious; the service is extremely patient, flexible, and friendly; and the decor is as fun and kitschy as anyone could wish for. Always great choices for vegetarians. I love that the patrons are so diverse: it's a great cross-section of Cleveland every time. After our first visit, we've never been disappointed, and we are definitely regulars. It ain't health food, but it is definitely delicious and always fun to go."}
{"text":"I love how anything can be deep fried. I'm from the South so thought I had seen it all - but a grilled cheese??? Why the heck not.   So I ordered the Monte Cristo. I was at first overwhelmed because the thing is huge (couldn't even eat an entire half), and then I was hesitant because of the powdered sugar on top. I mean, basically it's a grilled ham, turkey and cheese wrapped in a not-as-sweet-but-still-a-funnel-cake. Well friends, I'm glad I pushed through because it was so much more than that and I enjoyed the heck out of that sandwich. It was so gooey on the inside, the cheese/meat was flavorful and the battered and fried bread was perfect. But what really set it apart for me was how the powdered sugar complimented the whole thing - salty with the sweet and so, so good. I did try the side of raspberry sauce that came with but preferred the sandwich without.   I'd suggest going to Melt at off times because when I got there at 5pm on a Saturday it was still a 20 minute wait for a table for one. Luckily there was a stool at the bar. I have to say the atmosphere in general was friendly, especially for someone that was dining alone - and the bartender was just the right amount of attentive. Also, I LOVE that they had ABC Family with Uncle Buck playing on one of the TVs. I heart the Midwest."}
{"text":"My bestie and I went to the melt recently. They were very busy. We waited long for a table but service was fast and friendly. Didn't mind waiting as we enjoyed our purple haze beer. I got the monte cristo sandwich, it has ham, turkey and cheese and it's fried like French toast served with a jelly compote. We loved there French fries and could do without the coleslaw. I love the decor!!! Maybe next time we will go in between lunch and dinner so we don't have to wait so long. Thanks melt for the great food."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were huge and amazing.  I enjoyed the godfather on my first visit.  Can't wait for return trip to Cleveland to try another sandwich.  Plan on a long wait during weekends and peak hours."}
{"text":"So, I would cry if I ever developed a dairy allergy.  The thought of never being able to go to this place ever again just makes me sad, so let's move on.  This place makes me salivate just when I think about it. I've only been there a handful of times but since I have friends who live a block away, I should visit more often, yes? Of course, there is a wait. It's a small building with nowhere to expand. Don't complain about the wait. What impresses me is the quality of the food. So many different combinations where you could take the sandwiches, the soups, and the beers. Oh the beer selection. Honestly, the tomato and garlic soup is the perfect dip for the Kindergarten. The fries are the perfect combination of crispy and full. The fact that I'm able to get my friend who is vegan to forget she is for one meal and eat at Melt with us, well, doesn't that just say something?"}
{"text":"Got ours to go.  We called in an order and picked it up since I've heard about the wait times.  Let me tell you - heaven on a plate.  Can't wait to go back and try more, but maybe next time we will dine in.  The Dude Abides - get it.  Oh I will say, we went in on a Thursday evening (5:30-6) and parking was HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"If your looking for a quick in and out experience, keep it moving. I am one who believes that dining out is an occasion, a time to sit, relax, and bond amongst kindred beings. Melt is just that! Friendly and humble staff, classic yet cutting edge vintage styled decor, and some pretty spiffy monster grilled cheese. Try the \"wake & bacon\" great for delightful morning or a \"fourth\" meal :D"}
{"text":"Hard to find a seat for two so we decided to sit at the bar. Great alternative to just waiting 1hr or a seat. Got out food really fast and the bar tender was really friendly. Very trendy place to be. My date got a pulled pork sandwich, I got the Melt Pig Roast. Delicious and a little spicy! Will definitely go again and recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"(This review is regarding my meal at this SPECIFIC location. My experiences with the other Melts around Cleveland have been nothing but wonderful! I will continue to eat at the others in the future.)  I decided to venture away from the sandwiches today. And hey, I get it, this place is all about the grilled cheese. But why not try something else once in a while?  I'm a huge fan of the Parmageddon (pierogis with kraut and cheese on their awesome bread), but I didn't want the full sandwich and fries. Instead, I opted for the $7 pierogi appetizer. Now, when I think of how many pierogis $7 will cover, 2 is NOT the amount that pops into my mind. But when I saw my tiny bread plate that had two small pierogis swimming in about half a cup of wet kraut, I realized I had made a mistake with my order. Additionally, I asked for this item to not contain sour cream, and it came out with a huge dollop that had melted over the surface of the food. I wouldn't have minded saying something, but our server took off so she could go talk to people working at the bar.   After scraping away all the sour cream and eating my $3.50-per-piece appetizer, I ordered a bowl of soup just to have something else to eat. I went with the tomato, having remembered it being flavorful and rich. I was presented with what looked like a bowl of crushed tomatoes from a can, smothered in parmesan cheese, cheddar cheese, and onions. The soup had no noticeable taste or seasoning aside from salt, and I felt disappointed once again. I never got a water refill, either.  After ordering a coffee, an appetizer (which was more like a portion of an app), and a small bowl of soup, my bill came to around $14. The food wasn't great, the service was unappealing (read: a server who seemed like we were just wasting her time), and the restaurant wasn't even that busy, yet we still somehow ended up being crammed into a table next to another four top.   I've always loved Melt, but they either need to change up their pricing on their appetizers or offer more food. If the plate I had been served was $3 or $4, I would have been more than satisfied with it. The pierogis were flavorful, but I'm pretty angry about the tiny portion (when I could have gotten the Parmageddon with fries for $10 or $11). I've had their tofu wings as well, and while delicious, $9 should offer more than just a few. I'm not really sure if the quality is going down because of the expansion of the franchise, or if their prices are going up and I just haven't frequented the restaurant often enough to notice.   Can't say I'd be back to this location unless it was for a sandwich. The disparity between the portion sizes of the main attraction and everything else on the menu is pretty shocking."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome! From the service to the food. The vibe was super chill and welcoming."}
{"text":"This adorable little restaurant was on my mom's suggestion list, so we tried it out.  It was perfect!  From the bartender to the food, even the other patrons were great!  I can't even talk about the sandwiches because you know they are so good, but it is one of the few places here that I would frequent again - awesome and if I am here longer, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not living in the area for years I didn't know about the hype surrounding this place. We went today, a Monday, at 4pm and had no wait which is what many reviewers have complained about. The restaurant was about half full with nearly nobody at the bar.  Catching up with a friend I hadn't seen in awhile got us talking and the waitress was somewhat pushy in trying to get our order. I understand this need as it means a faster turnover of tables but the place wasn't even starting to get busy yet. This was just a minor problem.  The food was outstanding. We both got the sandwish of the month which was perogies, chicken, provolone and paprika. It was incredible. The size of the sandwich was surreal and I literally had to bring half home. I usually don't care for leftovers but this sandwish was a must in terms of being consumed for another meal.  I didn't have any of the beers although it did seem they had a good selection and that that bar area would be a fun time later in the evening.  We found out that we could park in the Rite Aid parking lot across the street which turned out to be no problem.   Overall pretty good. If I had to wait two hours like others it may have been a different review but I was happy with the place."}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about.....  Nice environment and food was OK, but not up to all the hype. Especially for the price."}
{"text":"Comfort food at its finest!  This place has a real \"Cleveland\" feel to it.  Nothing fancy, smaller in size - but w/great food & a large selection of beers.  I had a big old grilled cheeseburger w/fried egg & jalapenos.  It was absolutely fantastic!!  The brussels sprouts in Thai peanut sauce appetizer was out of this world, too.  All washed down w/24oz PBR's...............a fun place to go w/friends.  You won't go home hungry, either."}
{"text":"We are takeout people, every time is a long wait. And a few times I didn't get the correct order. Food is good when it's what you want."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying i'm one of those people who doesn't fall for hype, with that said I would say any hype this place gets is well deserved. Great draft selection and very good food. Service was friendly and helpful. Be prepared to wait a while though as it is packed even Sundays but all and all I would say the wait is well worth it. Also for an appetizer try the hangover fries."}
{"text":"I had to update the manager reached out to me via Yelp and we had a email conversation about my experience he bought us two more sandwiches which were totally up to the standards that I have come to expect from this established restaurant.   I will continue to tell one and all about the awesomeness we experienced!"}
{"text":"I'm really torn with my rating, so 2 stars it is. I have been a Melt fan since way back in the day when Matt first opened his tiny little place in Lakewood. We had been very loyal...then we moved to Florida, so now we only get it when we come back (maybe twice a year). The last three times we've been here have been very disappointing.   This was my first visit to the Independence location, and my first thought when I walked in was \"sell out.\" Honestly, most everything that makes Melt Melt is the eclectic vibe and individualistic style you can breathe in when you walk through the door. Lakewood used to ooze it (until it expanded), and Cleveland Hts has it, but you get none of that here. New, exposed brick trying to pass for old in a brand new building...the same Melt-esque employees transplanted from Lakewood and Coventry to suburbia...and a bunch of plastic Christmas yard decorations lighting the place up. It's the complete antithesis of what made Melt so great 8-10 years ago. It's a shame this place has sold out.   Onto the food...the sandwiches aren't what they used to be. My two go-to's have always been the Parmageddon and the Muni Magic. The P isn't the same...not sure if they changed the pierogi, but it's not as good. And the Muni is now the Municipal Stadium...and again, not what it used to be. The brat is almost burger-style now, and it is topped with shredded cheddar, not sure I understand why.   Prices...one of the most critical things you will read on Yelp, and it's true. I had a beer and the Muni tonight, $17.45. Yes, you get a lot of food, but the leftovers don't hold up, so it ends up being a waste of food that has seen a severe drop in quality.   All in all, Melt isn't what it used to be, but if you're going to go, make it worth your time and go to Lakewood, not the suburban wannabe on Rockside."}
{"text":"First time, they were out of fries.... How does that happen? Found a hair in my salad, and the kids meal came with a house salad, yeah my 15 month old wants a house salad.... The staff seemed rude and unattractive, take a shower before serving food please."}
{"text":"This place is very fun, great decor and a really nice staff. The food is excellent with almost everything available as a vegan or veg option that is not a shite substitute but a great option with all the taste.  Haven't been to the original but I can see why this one is still popular with the traveling crowd. It is in a strip mall with high ceilings, a large space and it's a little bright.  I come here to eat like a barbarian or take half home. Their beer selection is well managed and rotated often, and at a very reasonable price (although I wish they would bring back 5$ 60 min.)."}
{"text":"I am still dreaming of this place. Vegetarian heaven. The veggie chicken and waffles grilled cheese was so amazing. The restaurant itself was hip and entertaining. Staff was really friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype. The other reviews have covered the amazing food, so I am going to hype the beer list. It has about two dozen great brews in tap at any given time. The best part, though, is the price. Almost the whole list is $5, or about what they cost elsewhere at happy hour.   Oh, and make sure to get the special Thanksgiving sandwich in November."}
{"text":"We went 2/25/12  a little before 5pm.  They said it'd be 1:30-1:45 to be seated. No problem we really wanted to try this place since seeing it on Triple D. After being seated we had to wait over an hour for our food.  We noticed 2 other tables that were seated after us, served and almost done eating prior to getting our food. You'd think after waiting over 2 and a half hours and being hungry ANYTHING would taste great, however, the food was average at best. I got The Dude Abides, which the menu says comes with marinara.  I had to take the sandwich apart to see if they forgot to add it.  They was a very minimal amount on it, but the dryness of the sandwich called for more."}
{"text":"I've visited a number of times and have enjoyed it each time. The waiters are well trained and the food tastes great! There is a unique atmosphere within the restaurant that makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Always great food... my fav drink there is peach cider yummy.."}
{"text":"Like the service, love the food, hate the wait. Get there just before they open, and you'll be seated immediately."}
{"text":"Pros: Great environment! Loved the servers and the ambience of the whole place. Fun, cool, hip.  Interesting and unique options for sandwiches. Good selection of beers (not the standard stuff on tap, which is nice) Delicious fries! (my boyfriend thought the fries were just \"ok\" but I loved them) Cons: Appetizer (pierogi)- nothing fancy. I've had a better pierogi from my own freezer.  We ordered the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich and the Turkey sandwich. Both sandwiches were surprisingly lacking in cheese. Also, we just couldn't get past the thickness of the bread! Think: texas toast thick. Flavors were a bit overwhelming. Neither of us could finish our sandwiches.  If I were to go back (and i'd only give this place one more shot just due to it's originality), I would stick with a simple grilled cheese. Also, I would split my meal. Too much food!"}
{"text":"This place is decent if you want a great big grilled cheese sandwich and a huge plate of fries.  Emphasis on the GREAT BIG, they are huge.  If I went there too often my doctor would kill me with her bare hands before the cholesterol did. But anyway, yeah, the sandwiches are good, although in general they're very simple and you could probably whip them up yourself at home in a lot less time.  The fries and similar are very very good and the beer selection is also good.   The place does get really crowded and unfortunately, hectic and VERY noisy.  Loud music, chairs scraping on the floor, people hollering at each other.  It's like eating in a crowded bar or at a rock club during the dinner hour.  Probably not a place to go if you want to have a laid-back conversation with your dinner partner, unless perhaps you can sit outside.   I was sitting two feet away from my companion and we literally had to shout at each other to be heard, this on a Sunday afternoon with the place maybe 2/3 full.   My main complaint besides the noise was the service.  I don't know if they were just short staffed or if this is a constant thing since I live out of town and only get to eat in Lakewood once in a blue moon, but it took an exceedingly long time for our food to be served, again this was on a day when the place was not full. I got the impression that the staff was a lot more interested in chatting with each other and serving people at the bar than they were in preparing and running food to the tables, as we were not the only ones who seemed to be waiting forever.  We eventually got food after maybe a 45-50 minute wait (this was for two relatively uncomplicated cheeze sandwiches with fries) and then our server disappeared for a very long time and we couldn't find him when it was time to get the check.  I had to get to the airport so I was in something of a hurry and I hadn't expected lunch to take as long as it did.    Bottom line is if you want a good cheese sandwich, fries and a beer, you don't mind noise, you're not in a hurry, and you don't mind the hipper-than-thou vibe, Melt is a decent place to eat.  Even with the minuses, I'll probably go back again, but there are a lot of good bars at which to eat and drink similar things in the area that are probably a little less hassle."}
{"text":"I never knew a peanut butter and banana sandwich could be so delicious. The banana was caramelized and some yummy cream cheese was added before grilling. It was so big that 2 of us shared and were too full to have dessert. The service was great and I will definitely go back and try some of the enticing things on the menu."}
{"text":"I was on a food run from metro detroit to cleveland, akron and columbus...and melt was right in my sights.  I phoned in a carryout around 2:50 P.M on a Tuesday.  (the kindergarten) which is a basic grilled cheese with slaw and fries.  I arrived as asked 20 minutes or so...and the food was just about ready. The server asked if I needed cutlery (which is always nice).  So I'll rank the server a 5.  I snagged the food and tipped the carryout person...and headed out the door of the 1/2 full restaurant... to chow down the food while driving on I90east   to 77 S.....to Akron for a Pizza Bianca at Rizzi's.  I opened the bag....and the food was all in a very nice plastic hinged see thru container...(nice carryout box).   The Grilled cheese sandwich was quite large, cut in half, mostly bread standing 2-3 inches or so tall (big toasted bread, the kind that has a tendency to cut the roof of your mouth cuz it's so dang hard.). and some american cheese.   Not a squished down grilled cheeze...they seem to showcase the bread at Melt.   It reminded me of the \"Ohio Deli\" in Columbus...the \"Dagwood.\".gigantic bread....enough meat , but a crap load of bread.  Even the container was similar.....  Back to melt...   It was enough cheese, not skimpy mind you...but just enough...for the overall size of the sandwich..  Certainly not the same amount that the newly opened \"Bigg Burger \" in Livonia, Michigan tosses on....but it was enough cheese to keep me happy. ...and for $5.50  Out the door?...with fries and slaw?....a decent enough deal. Even with the tip it was still a decent enough deal.  The fries were salted and peppered?..and reminded me of they type of fry that Bernaldi's? serves at their restaurant and stands at cedarpoint..  skin on..semi greezzzzy...and certainly edible.  Slaw?   This is a different slaw....crunchy,peppery,horsradishy? worth trying at least once.  Why the pickles are there, I can't say.  So why not a 4 or a 5?  I'm not sure...maybe it was that I've been spoiled by\" Bigg Burger\" in Michigan.  A place the size of a Rally's that makes their grilled cheeze better and faster...and cheaper $2.50...and it's just gobbed up with cheeze, if anything too much cheeze....and to be fair a bit smaller and easier to handle while driving at 70 MPH....on the cratered moonscape that resembles Michigan's roadways.  Add an order of fries it's about the same price....but even their fries?   are better than \"Melt's.\".. Giving the venerable \"Bates Hamburger\" a few miles south  a serious run for the money ; although a completely different beast...in the potato department..  Would I try Melt again?...Certainly....probably something with meat next time , a Parmageddon sounds like a nice sandwich to drive around Cleveland with...."}
{"text":"I hate waiting and I hate hype. Because of this, to be honest, I want to hate this place; everyone says it's SOOOO AMAZING and on top of that, unless you get there at 11am or after 10pm, you will wait forever for a table and then wait forever for your food. But I can't hate it and here's why: the food is really, really good. I mean, it's grilled cheese, sure, but it's well prepared with fresh ingredients and all these yummy and fun add-ins. The portions are gigantic; be warned all the cheese and fries and bread will probably push you into a food coma after your meal so don't go here and then try and be productive at work afterwards. I guarantee you will wait, wait, wait but part of that is because your waiter will never rush you here so once you're seated, you can really sit and enjoy your meal and your company. I've tried various grilled cheeses, soups, salads, burgers - everything is delish, especially the burgers. They even have some vegan cheese options so you can bring your no-dairy friends."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Mac and cheese tasteless. Kindergartener all bread no cheese. Only good thing was the French fries. Truthfully I'd pass."}
{"text":"Melt has some of the best food I've had in a long, long time (including many restaurants with three times the price tag).    Making a good grilled cheese isn't hard.  Making a wide variety of amazing sandwiches (which generally involve bread and cheese) that are hearty without being greasy, fresh and flavorful, as well as lots of appetizers and side dishes isn't, and Melt did this all, and did it with style.  I got the sandwich that was a piece of lasagne between garlic bread, which sounds ridiculously decadent.  It was, but it wasn't greasy -- cheesy, yes, but balanced.  The lasagne was aromatic with fennel from the fennel pasta, the sauce was good -- if someone put just the lasagne on my plate at a fancy Italian place and charged me $20 I'd call it amazing; at $11 with garlic bread, fries, and slaw, it was a steal.    The veggies of the day were also really flavorful -- this was a running theme.  Bold, bright flavors in everything.  The chocolate BBQ sauce, the spinach-artichoke dip (often an excuse to serve greasy cheese with green flecks -- here it tasted first of artichokes, then of spinach, with some salt and heat and cheese coming after the vegetables.)   Split a sandwich or be ready to take a lot of food home so you can eat the appetizers/sides; you don't want to miss them.  The draft beer list is extensive and eclectic; the bottled list likewise.  Cocktails were well-made and the alcohol selection good.   And the waitstaff went above and beyond the call of duty to make a busy holiday night pleasant."}
{"text":"If you have not been to Melt yet why not? The grilled cheese sandwiches may not live up to the hype but they are pretty dang good. Lots of sandwich options for everyone, from chorizo to lasagna to fried fish along with vegan and vegetarian choices. Every sandwich comes with a side of fries (average) and cole slaw (peppery and awesome). The beer selection is pretty good too and fairly priced. It seems next to visiting the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Museum eating at Melt is just one of those things all Clevelanders must do at least once in their here. Tip: If you don't want to wait make sure you get there at 11 on the dot when they open for lunch or else you are looking at a 30 minute wait or much much longer."}
{"text":"YUM !!!!!   EAT HERE !!!!!  Best damn sandwiches and fries your mouth will ever taste !!!!  You gotta go here !!!! 10 stars !!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! Every time I come here, I have to try a different appetizer and grilled cheese. You can't go wrong-- parmageddon, the dude abides, big popper. All so delicious. The service is great, although the wait can be a little long and it sucks that they don't take reservations. Definitely worth it though."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, Melt has transformed into a Ohio brand. The base of a good sandwich is of course the bread. Melt knocks their homemade bread out of the park. There unique twist on grilled cheese will leave you wanting more and more. You will develop an addiction to conquering each one of their massive sandwiches. I'm a grown man, who can pack away some food, Melts servings make me feel like a boy again. I'm embarrassed to admit that I have never finished a sandwich in one sitting. There fries are hand-cut  and delightful, and don't even get me started on the slaw.  Of course, they have a great selection of craft beer as well. They also have some excellent bartenders mixing up some crazy good cocktails.  If you're new to the area, or just visiting, I cannot suggest melt enough."}
{"text":"Great stop if you are Cleveland bound. You may have a bit of a wait, but its well worth it. Melt doesn't just make grilled cheese, they redefined it. There are some awesome sandwich combinations on their menu. The one that I tried had a meatball, marinara sauce, cheese, and fried cheese sticks. That's right there were cheese sticks on my grilled chesse. HEAVEN!! I may have clogged my arteries but I don't care! Nom Nom!!"}
{"text":"Melt is the place I take guests when they visit because I know they will love the food and the atmosphere. It's a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy a great beer selection. If you go there with folks you enjoy, you barely notice the wait.   I think of it as a bar that serves amazing food, where the people that complain seem to think of Melt as more of a restaurant.   My favorites are the Purple Parma (eggplant & marinera + cheese), the Parmagedon (pirogues and cheese) and the Mushroom Melt (onions, mushrooms and I add spinach). The vegetable special is always a good choice; my favorite is the brussel sprouts in ginger glaze."}
{"text":"Finally have been able to come to a Melt and they did not disappoint at all. Got to eat outside which is a pretty nice and cozy set up, especially since my wife and I were on a Date night. I ordered the 5 alarm chili and Black Cat. Words can't even describe how great they tasted, definitely put Melt on top of favorite restaurants.  My wife ordered the Melt Pig Roast and that was nothing less than spectacular also (I know since I helped eat some). The waiters and waitresses were just so friendly and nice and seem to go out of their way to make sure you are happy and enjoying your visit. Melt is definitely going to get return business from myself and wife and highly recommended to everyone."}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to drive out to the Heights to go to melt rather than deal with the crowds at Lakewood.  It was pretty dead when we went (noon on a Saturday). We were a bit concerned that it was near-dead when we went, but the quality was just as great, and the service was superior to what we have experienced due to the lack of crowd.  We will return."}
{"text":"Overall the food is pretty good and if the service was better, it may be worth the wait.  But anytime ive been there, the servers move at the speed of snails (and this is after they know you've been waiting awhile for your table!).  Unless you go on an off hour, you'll be waiting at least 45 mins for a table- then at least another hour to get served and get your check."}
{"text":"I will never stop at this location ever again. I will only go to the Lakewood location.  There doesn't seem to be any quality control here. I ordered my favorite sandwich, the dude abides, and received a meatball COMPLETELY PINK inside. My girlfriend had the same sandwich - her meatballs were done.   I brought this to my server's attention who went to query the cooks. They told her that is normal and that they cook to temperature. BS."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Melt, I am always greeted and served by warm, friendly faces. My overall experience there is pleasant from the quirky decor to the amazing sandwiches. The variety of grilled cheese will make anyone happy and they even have options for those with dietary restrictions. I recently had the Mushroom Melt, which includes garlic, mushrooms, caramel port onions, wilted baby spinach, and provolone. It was delicious! Though the portions are big, you have the great option to get a half a sandwich instead of a full one. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone from families to couples for a great and delicious night!"}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken.  Microscopic piece of chicken with goopy slaw, way too acrid bleu cheese crumbles, and ranch, not bleu cheese, dressing.   Chip chop micro kibble fries.  Uck.   Good waitress though."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are HUGE. I always wish I'd ordered a half, but never remember in time. As someone who loves pierogi, I was pretty disappointed with the appetizer, both in flavor and size, but honestly no one is coming here for that. They have a great variety of options that can be added to your grilled-cheese of choice. My boyfriend loves the Cleveland Brisket, it's the only sandwich in Cleveland that can somewhat satisfy his craving for a good old steak sub from back home (NY). Staff is always friendly. Fries are a bit salty. Restaurant has a cool vibe."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere, very hip. Let's talk about why I am not giving any stars. If you have more than 15 people it goes on one check! Wtf! They did not let us know any of this. They wouldn't even budge about fixing this situation...ok they divided it by the amount of people that were there....guess what some people just ordered a beer and now they are paying 24 dollars they never spent!"}
{"text":"Interesting and exciting menu.  We loved everything we ordered. We also enjoyed the atmosphere. When in Cleveland, we will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Melt does live up to the hype, if that is possible. I feel a little bad for locals who get crowded out by out-of-towners like me, but not very much!  Although beers seem to be the thing here, I encourage you to check out the creative mixed drinks. I had the cucumber cooler and it was a perfect counterpoint to the slightly spicy Melt Pig Roast special. Yum.   I hear they have opened a second location, which I hope doesn't foretell the beginning of a bigger chain. As much as I would love to eat here all the time, I would hate to see the quality diluted."}
{"text":"This is great food. Lots of vegan options. My only complaint is the vegan cheese. It's pretty bad. They used to use the shredded daiya cheese and it was delicious. Now they use the slices and the taste is awful in my opinion. I just ask  them to leave it off my favorite sandwich (the wet hot buffalo vegan chicken sandwich). Other than that it's a great place."}
{"text":"Melt Bar is a fad food, and I wonder how long it will be trendy for.  Of course it's tasty.  It's carbs and fat.  The french fries are delicious and you're in glutton heaven for the first 15 minutes of your meal, followed by a possible tummy ache or guilt.  But is this worth a 2 hour 45 minute wait?  Let me put this into perspective.  You could watch one of the LOTR trilogy movies in this time.    The restaurant's design is purposefully inefficient to make you wait and hopefully buy drinks at the bar.  They make you wait to build a perception of quality and desire.  Unless you come at off-peak hours, do yourself a favor: buy 2 pieces of texas toast, drench them in butter, put a 1/2 pound of your favorite meats, cheeses, veggies, etc in the middle, and double fry your fries.  And then eat that while watching LOTR at home.  :p  DIY"}
{"text":"the food is great but the service is lacking. On two separate occasions we went there and the food was an hour late and both tables (who ordered after us) got served before us. I would think twice about going there again....."}
{"text":"Got the Monte Cristo. Simply awesome. The side of fruit syrup made the sandwich taste like a jelly donut. Salty meat - w sweet deep fried crust. Cannot go wrong. Great beer selection too!!"}
{"text":"As a devoted Food Network fan, I was of course beyond excited to see Cleveland make its mark on its shows through its new restaurant Melt. I did my due diligence and read through Yelp reviews so I knew I was in for a killer wait.   My friend and I arrived at around 5:15pm on a Wednesday, and had no problem finding a seat at the bar. Others who were waiting for a table had a 30 minute wait. I went with the Monte Cristo, and we hunkered down for a 30+ minute wait on our food (even though the place was barely full!) When the food arrived we were more than ready to chow down, and luckily the portions were HUGE. I pride myself on being able to eat quite a lot and I only ate half the sandwich and maybe half the fries. But to be honest, the sandwich wasn't amazing. They definitely have some creative ideas:  the fries are to be dipped in the berry preserves sauce and the bread on the Monte Cristo itself was something like a funnel cake. However, the sandwich dripped grease while I ate, and the bread to cheese/ham ratio erred on the side of too much bread. I am not the healthiest eater, but I felt the sandwich was too heavy. It's artery clogging food at its best, full of fat, grease, and salt. Had I been drunk, this would have been heaven.  The fries were good and next time I would opt for the Ultimate Fries and a lighter sandwich.  By the time we were done with our meal at 6:30pm, the place was filling up fast and there people were eyeing our bar seats like hawks. There was even a waiting line for the bar seats! All in all, I don't know if it was worth the hype, although I would try it out again, as long as it was at an off-peak time."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here so I was happily surprised to find the place has doubled in size with its recent expansion. \"Great, I thought, maybe it won't be such a nut house and the wait for the food will be reasonable!\"  Sadly, I was wrong. On a Sunday night, around 8:00, with the place NOT at all crowded, it took one hour from the time our simple order was placed to get our food. AND we ate at the bar, which is considerably quicker than ordering (and waiting) at a table. Ridiculous and bewildering. The food is great, the beer selection terrific. Why can't MELT get its act  together with the service and the confoundedly long waits for food? Obviously, the expansion did NOT include the kitchen or the number of cooks! Come on, you are grilling sandwiches here, not preparing complicated cuisine. Unfortunately,  poor service prevents MELT from being one of  Cleveland's top places.  Of course, if you don't care if you have to wait an hour to get a grilled cheese sandwich, this place is for you."}
{"text":"I don't know if I'll ever go back to melt. This place used to be awesome but it has changed since they have become more like a chain. They should of stayed true to what got them started. It's only a matter of time before melt is not in business. Service was good, quality of food was poor. I can not justify spending my hard earned money on food that isn't even close to what it used to be."}
{"text":"Melt is definitely one of the best, most unique restaurants in Northeast Ohio. A huge selection of different types of grilled cheese (who ever thought there'd be so many options?), a full bar, and even fried twinkies for dessert.  In addition to the pre-designed sandwiches, you're able to build almost any kind of gilled cheese sandwich you could want from their list of toppings and cheeses. They also serve burgers and a few other entrées as well. And don't forget their Sunday brunch, just outstanding!  The one downside is the often encountered wait for a table and the wait for your meal once you have a table. Melt is a popular place so when it's busy, things get a little slow, but the staff is friendly and I've never had too much of an issue with waiting. But just know if you're going on a Friday or weekend night, you'll probably need to wait a bit unless you go off-hours."}
{"text":"I love this place too. I went here on a date with a friend. Since then I've been back several time. I've introduce two people to Melt's and they like it too."}
{"text":"Melt is a restaurant that you really only need to experience once, and never feel the need to go back. I've tried several of their sandwiches: the Monte Cristo, Cuban War Pig, Wet Hot Chicken and the theme is the same. A shitload of greasy bread with a small amount of filling relative to the amount of bread. Portions are ridiculously large and do not reheat well. Awful coleslaw. Fries are hit or miss, but usually are limp, lifeless and greasy. Decor is unexciting, every server appears to be a 20 something hipster. Melt must be doing well though, they sure are expanding rapidly."}
{"text":"Being from Colorado I had heard of Melt from Man Vs Food and Guy from the travel channel.    I ordered a custom sandwich, but also found all the grilled cheese options were amazing.    I had a great customer service and awesome food experience.    I would recommend it to anyone!  Awesome."}
{"text":"It hurts me giving this place a 3 star. Even though I had a nice sandwich and the fries were fierce but there is something as too much food. Though of course I could have carried it home and had it the next day but I am not a soggy sandwich eater. It was on triple D the night before I was heading to meet my brother in Cleveland. So it was a no-brainer that I would take him there. However, the portions were just too HUGE. Sometimes too much food just kills your appetite, so thats what happened. to us. I had a flying falafel (which was good if you just ate the falafel and left the thick thick bread out).   My brother had some fish thing and both of us could barely chow down half our sandwiches. The bar seats could be a tad bit more comfortable given that they have a huge wait so it doesnt hurt to make your bar chairs more comfy for those who would like to sit at the bar and eat.  Definitely a quirky place and you should not be turned off by a plate overflowing with food."}
{"text":"Melt is not only a restaurant/bar....its an experience!    When my boyfriend suggested a day trip to cleveland we immediately hopped on yelp for a place to dine and hang for the evening.  Since we're kinda beer nerds we checked out their beers and decided on Melt and we are definately happy with our decision.  Great food, great people, extremely friendly staff, and the beer selection kept our mouths watering for more.  We put our name in and was told it would be an hour and a half wait, which we were totally prepared for thanks for the info we read on here.  However, we love sitting at the bar, so when a couple seats at the bar opened up, it was on!  We started making friends immediately, Tricia (the manager) was off work and sitting next to us.  She gave suggestions and made great conversation with us, which was really fun.  She also introduced us to alot of the staff.  It made us feel as if we were around great friends.  Thank you to all we met....Lindsey, Hootie, Dave, Bob and Carol - there were so many more, but this is all I could remember...SORRY GUYS!  It was a spectacular night!  Thanks to all who had a part in it."}
{"text":"Total yum! First, you can't go wrong with melted cheese in my opinion, and second, they do it with flair!  Great atmosphere, although be prepared to wait a while for a table. I never mind though, they have an extensive beer list and creative cocktails to keep you busy while you wait.  Very good mix of people, tending toward the alternative-indie-arty crowd but there are often even a few kids there in the earlier hours or at brunch on the weekends which is by the way AWESOME."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time eating at the Melt and it was everything...I had a Pork Cuban sandwich and the serving was so big that I had enough for lunch today. I also had the Electric Blue Lemonade which was awesome and then to top it all..my server offered me a Melt Card which saves me $10 for every 100 points I earn. I will definitely come back with my kids."}
{"text":"When it comes to Cleveland cuisine, Melt is the best.  You will wait for about an hour (usually more) at just about any time of the day or night.  That's the one complaint I've ever heard about Melt, they're too busy.  They have a HUGE beer list.  Their food is creative and delicious.  The Parmaggedon is a pierogie sandwich and the Big Popper is basically a giant jalapeno popper on bread that gets beer battered and deep fried.  Delicious.  Melt is also vegetarian and vegan friendly.  The soda does tend to be a little flat due to old carbonation lines (I asked once) so I stick to water, tea, or lemonade.  There are over 100 kind of beer if that's more your thing though."}
{"text":"We were in town for the week and had read about this place online. It was better/worse than expected. I say worse because my body was not ready for the deliciousness and mass amounts of grease it endured. Worth it. Totally would go again. The staff was really nice as well!"}
{"text":"Best lunch iv'e had in years , Large sandwiches and love the fries,more than average person can eat. and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Melt is the best place for grilled cheese! Also have an amazing beer selection, and always are changing their specials."}
{"text":"After watching the Melt Challenge on Man vs. Food, I decided that I needed to check out Melt Bar and Grilled when I had the chance to swing through Cleveland.  The place was packed, even for those of us who were there for take out.  I decided to order a Parma, Italy, which is a chicken parmesan grilled cheese sandwich.  It had taken over a half hour to get the food, but the trade off is that you get a huge portion of food.  The Melt is definitely a trendy place, considering the crowd, plus the decor is kitschy with its random items around the wall.  It's one of those places you should try once, but I don't think I'll be going out of my way to dine at Melt specifically."}
{"text":"We arrived at The Melt to find a really nice and relaxing place. The menus are old 33 rpm album covers (which I thought was a cool touch).  I had a hard time deciding which gourmet grilled cheese sandwich to order from the menu because they all sounded to good.  Then \"The Dude Abides\" caught my eye. This HUGE sandwich arrived at the table just a short time after ordering. Each half of this succulent sandwich had a huge homemade meatball that was so tasty with perfect Italian flavors to the tender meat. The meatballs were then topped with fried mozzarella cheese sticks, thick and tasty marinara sauce and melted provolone and Romano cheeses. Then the bread was grilled to buttery perfection! What a delight. The plate was covered with fries and a large side of coleslaw. I was delighted to find malt vinegar on the table for the fries! I was only able to eat half of the sandwich so I took the other half home for later.  I also had a taste of the \"Northcoast Shores\" sandwich. This sandwich was heavenly. The first bite had this velvety herbed cream cheese with tender garlic spinach, sweet roasted red peppers, and tender crab cakes all bursting into a symphony of flavor in my mouth.  A friend of mine had the Melt House salad. A large portion came to the table topped with sweet sun-dried tomatoes, yummy goat cheese, and a tasty berry balsamic dressing.  Another delight to my eye was the wide variety of beers on draft, seasonal brews, micro-brews, imports and domestics on the menu. There are also some interesting drink concoctions that I would have loved to try.  I can't wait to go back to Cleveland just to try something else on the menu. I would have loved to had room for fried Twinkies or some bread pudding!"}
{"text":"\"wahhhhh! I am a big baby and i am gonna pound my 'wittle' fists if i don't get a table NOW!!!!\" If that is YOU going to Melt and reviewing less than 5 stars, move on down the line, like head to, say, Snapple-bees, or what ever....  Now, seriously - awesome food, great beer selection, awesome staff, comfortable room, great prices... BOOM 5 STARS. Yup, they got it going on. Yeah, we had to wait, SO what!!!!! We had a couple beers, rapped with other patrons, joked with the wait staff and after a bit, our table was ready. Was it worth it? BOO YA!! !We came at lunch rush on a Saturday, BTW  Got the Parmagedon with peirogies, nope, can't spell it but done LOVED IT! My chick and i split it and no way we could have eaten alone. The potato filled dough pockets were cooked perfectly and so was the cabbage. And man, we LOVED the slaw. Different for sure and best part, not from a GFS bucket. Across the table was the Buffalo chicken version monster. He loved it! Minor notice... maybe a little less breading and the taste was great. Rarely do \"conglemerations of food\" have as much flavor and flavor profile as the food here. And to close, I HAD THE BEST FRIES I HAVE EVER EATEN here at Melt. Golden brown and delicious, and seasoned correctly, a great compliment to the sandwiches. Wish they cooked this well down here in middle Ohio...   With the vibe, the staff and how great the food was, carping about the 'wait' is so not worth it, and if that is all you have whine about about you may want to go elsewhere. And then i can be like \"HA HA, they missed out a great place for chow and beers! Big babies....\"  Love this place and going back for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what the big appeal of this place is. I've been multiple times, theres usually a wait, but in the end, its just big, greasy, grilled cheese sandwhiches. I try something new every time I go in, and still have found nothing that I've been impressed with. Service is good, but this Cleveland staple isn't worth they hype."}
{"text":"Everything is great but the parmageddon is crazy good. Every sandwich is delicious. Love this place."}
{"text":"Obviously everyone from the Cleveland area, especially Lakewood, knows that melt is where it's at! A must see for out of town visitors or locals who have not yet experienced Melt's cheesy goodness, friendly yet edgy wait staff, and delectable draught selection. Vegan and gluten free options are killer. Enormous portions, novelty decor, and unique flavor combinations that will leave you waddling out the door."}
{"text":"I thought the place dirty.  Food was good.    Waitress was rude.  She made a snide comment to my daughter when asked if they had Wi-Fi. for her phone, and proceeded to comment on how the owner didn't people own their phones as it was too distracting.( Odd comment when the place has large TV's and video games screaming in the background).  And, then when my daughter placed her order, she made her say \"please\".    I really just wanted to punch her but being the adult that I am, I just ignored her and placed her order."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are HUGE.  Cole slaw is deelish.  Ambiance is awesome.  The longggg wait...not so much."}
{"text":"The first thing that shocked me when I moved to Northeast Ohio is that the area seems to have a raging appetite for enormous portions of mediocre food.   Melt does it a little better, though not too much. The waitstaff is friendly and tattooed, the beer selection is strong, and the sandwiches are creative and well put-together. They are enormous, which seems to be the majority of the selling point? Kind of expensively enormous? To boot, the waiting times are as big as the sandwiches.   I really gave the place a shot (ordered the Parmageddon) but I couldn't escape the reality of really despising a 4 pound meal. My family history of heart disease seemed to be calling my name as I ate. I biked ten miles the day after and felt a little better, so maybe build some exercise the day after into your plan.   If you don't have enough cheese, butter, fat, and salt in your life, melt is where I would start. If you've gotten over that stage in your life (or your doctor has told you to), skip.   Step your life up, lakewood, there's more to it than large cheesy buttery sandwiches."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise this place was!!! At first I was a little leary after hearing that the wait could be up to 4 hours long but I am a sandwich lover. Think about it.....you can really put anything between 2 pieces of bread and eat it.. I ordered the grilled PB and Banana. I think it was the best thing I've ever eaten and my friends couldn't stop raving about their sandwhiches either.  The service was excellent and do not leave without trying a slice of their pumpkin cheesecake!!!! I am definately a fan"}
{"text":"People have already written about the epic waits and the food ad nauseum, so I'd rather point out that if you have the luxury and the interest to go to Melt on a weekday evening, after the kitchen closes, and just hang out at the bar with a friend, it can be a really good time.  I am a fan of the food -- and I don't think it's that much of a struggle to go down the street and kill some time at a coffee house or wherever (you can get your pregame on with a beer at The Root Cafe) while you wait for your table to free up -- and I go to Melt for the experience of engaging in something ridiculous and decadent.  But the atmosphere is what keeps drawing me back, and having the opportunity to sit around and enjoy the people (including the staff, with whom I've never had a problem) without a rush or a crowd is really nice."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were too big and messy to manage.  The portions were generous.  The fries were too mushy and salty.  The soup had a weird, vomit-like texture.  Service was OK."}
{"text":"Great comfort food and a great beer list. Had a Milk Stout with my Italian Grilled Cheese. Awesome! The only problem is that it's tough to get in without a long wait.  I'm fine going on a Monday afternoon to get my fix!"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this Melt here in Mentor. I loved it. was expecting a larger wait when we go here with it being a Saturday, but luckily the weather is garbage. I had the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon. it was delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first Melt experience - I'd never visited the Lakewood location but have heard good things.  We were told initially the wait was an hour and 45 min, which seemed ridiculous, but were told we could sit at the bar and be served immediately.  Upon finding seating, we order a beer, appetizers, and sandwiches.  The beer selection was great and arrived in an extremely timely fashion.  The appetizers came shortly after and relatively timely.    Among our group of 3, one ordered chili, another ordered the tomato soup, and the spinach artichoke dip was shared.  Everyone seemed pleased with all three items.  I was especially impressed with the spin dip because it seemed like a fresh take on a cliche menu item. It was a bit thicker and had a more intense cheese flavor.  Although \"dip\" is used loosely because of the thickness.  We ordered three separate sandwiches.  All 3 of us were pleased and only finished 1/2.  I ordered the \"Hot Italian\" and would recommend it to anyone that likes a regular Italian sandwich, although it was pretty basic.  Unfortunately the real issue came with waiting for at least an hour and  a half for our sandwiches.  My issue is not that of impatience; it's more of an issue of lack of resources.  The bar and dining room were full but people weren't busting at the seams.  This indicates to me the kitchen is unable to accommodate the seating capacity of the restaurant - and this seems like a pretty huge restaurant mistake.    But it's new and working out kinks I'm sure.  It's a hip place for young people that I think would be super fun for happy hour.  The decor is funky and likable.  So I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, but I'm not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"There is definitely plenty of food when you eat at the melt. I never finish my sandwich, only eat half, and have enough fries for several days. I have gotten the Curry Chicken Sandwich, which is excellent, twice. It has cheese of course, curried chicken, chutney and a lentil patty. I love their beer selection and the atmosphere is pretty cool too. Never had a bad experience at this place. I've never had to complain about the service either."}
{"text":"Yikes! There is so much hype revolving Melt, but the place has yet to live up to my expectations.   I visited this location with the hopes that it would surpass my experiences at the Independence location. Unfortunately it fell short. We had a really great server that made really great suggestions on which craft sodas we should try (go for the Sarsaparilla-a really awesome, flavorful root beer!!). Instead of fries, I opted for the side salad, and asked for a recommendation on the dressing. She suggested the ranch as they make it in house. It really was the best ranch I have ever had. I highly recommend it!  When it came to the entrees things really fell flat. I ordered the Hungry Hungarian. I'm alright with sloppy, but this was out of control. This should not be a meal served in sandwich form. The bread became super soggy, and the sauce really lacked flavor. My boyfriend got the Cleveland Cheese Steak. Again, really soggy with the bread, and entirely too much going on between the bread.   I'd only go back for that root beer, and a salad with that wonderful ranch dressing. I won't be ordering a \"grilled cheese\" here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting my daughter, we just got a basic grilled cheese, soup and salad to share. The soup and salad were pretty great but their sandwich was just okay, nothing too spectacular there. Decent service, again nothing all that great though. I would recommend them if you want a good soup or salad or maybe more of a special sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  The wait staff was awesome, they were very attentive and new everything about there menu.  They also had great energy. You get a lot of food for a great price. It is hard to pick what you want to eat with so many great options to pick from.  We came in from out of state and this will defiantly be a stop for us the next time we are in ohio."}
{"text":"melt is one of my absolute favorite places...it's brilliant, really: great beer and cheese, what could be better? and not just your ordinary grilled cheese, but an entire menu full of grilled cheese. now i have a confession, i've never actually ordered the sandwiches off the menu because i  make up my sandwiches based on my favorite cheeses (blue cheese and cheddar), but i've tried ones that my friends have ordered and they are always great. huge beer selection, one of the few places i've found in cleveland with the delerium beers, amongst others. good decor, lots of cleveland memorabilia.  sometimes a bit of a wait on the weekends, and there's not a whole lot of room to stand but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but I don't.  I've been there 4 times over the last 3 years and have not like anything that I've eaten.  The bread is too, too thick and the \"grease\" they use to fry the sandwich is awful.  Don't tell me it's butter because I don't know any butter that tastes like that or upsets my stomach the way their sandwiches do.  The filling in their sandwiches is barely there compared to the amount of bread.  The  coleslaw is almost inedible; and I like coleslaw. I've tasted other family members food when we have gone there and just can't find something worth going back for.  Melt is highly overrated."}
{"text":"I live about 45 minutes outside of Cleveland and have always heard rave reviews about Melt. I went there for the first time not too long ago and all the reviews were correct - it was amazing! The beer list is quite extensive, the staff was extremely friendly and attentive despite it being a crazy Friday night, and the food was delicious!   I tried the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken melt and my fiancée got the Chicken and Waffles melt. Our plan was to each get a full sandwich and switch a half with each other but we both loved our own sandwiches so much we only ended up sharing a couple bites. The fries were an awesome mix between \"baseball fries\" and \"fair fries\" in texture, they were delicious!  We will definitely be making the 45 minute trek to go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken waffle (happy hour 7$) I was so disappointed with the sandwich. Waffles came out cold, dry, and old. Fried chicken was average. But buffalo Mac n cheese was yum."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place smells, and not in a good way like a restaurant should. It smells a little like rotten something, it needs a deep clean. It isn't even grease smell or anything identifiable easily. We weren't please with the service or our food either. The bread is too much and the concept is good, but the execution just isn't there."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are way to big.  I'm a BIG eater but these were to large to handle.  Food was ok."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Melt Bar & Grilled.  I stayed away because I heard horror stories about the interminable wait to get seated.  I met my friends who already secured a table by the time I arrived.  Their wait:  1 hour and 10 minutes on an late Saturday afternoon (4:00 p.m.).  Please note that the tables are very close together which makes moving about a little difficult especially if you are of stout build.  I forget the server's name (Dan?).  He was awesome; friendly, attentive and a vegetarian to boot.  Since I wanted something veggie, he was very helpful.  I chose the Mushroom Melt with the addition of sauteed spinach.  It was quite delicious with wonderful flavor but as another reviewer said, it was chintzy on the cheese.  Since the majority of this establishment's branding is based on cheese, one would think that a vegetarian sandwich would have lots of gooey cheese to make up for the lack of meat.  The thick white bread was very good and nicely grilled but where's a whole grain choice?  Melt has nice options for vegetarians so offering some kind of whole grain bread would be a bonus.  When I emailed them a few weeks before my visit, I asked them if they offered whole grain bread and they never answered me.  The fries were pretty good and not too greasy; I ate all of them first.  The slaw is slightly dry with a pleasant vinegar taste.  I think it needs more of something.  I shook on some malt vinegar which helped with the dryness and the slaw grew on me.  This is definitely NOT a place where you can have an intimate conversation.  It is very loud and cacophonous and therefore we had great difficulty talking to each other.  That was kind of frustrating as we are a group of girls that get together once a month to catch up with each other.  One last thing:  this is also a place where you don't feel comfortable lingering after your meal.  The server did not overtly rush us out, but he was very quick to bring boxes for our leftovers and the checks.  He had a way of politely moving you along.  But as I said, if you tend to linger after your meal, be aware that many hungry eyes from the waiting area will be staring at you like The Walking Dead.  I would say that I would return maybe at a less busy time (if there is one) or get a take-away sandwich."}
{"text":"After all the noise about how wonderful this place was, we had finally went in during lunch hours to check it out. First of all, for there being no lunch rush to speak of, the service: HORRIBLE. On to the food. Though it matched the description on the menu, it certainly does not live up to the hype if internet buzz, or word of mouth. Neither of us are interested in a return trip."}
{"text":"Just had to try this place when I was passing through the neighborhood recently. After all the hype, which can often mean a place has expanded too much for its own good, I was pleasantly surprised (and super full) from my experience here. I like that the menu wasn't extensive. Your options (other than couple salads) are sandwich's and that's it. But the variety of options (and limitless create your own options) still affords variety.   I got the BBQ chicken with fried onion straws, chocolate stout sauce, cheddar and I don't even know what else because it was so large and smothery.   Despite the number of people there on a Thursday evening, we were sat promptly, and service was quick, attentive and friendly. Worth the price, too. Obviously this is more than enough for one person to consume in one sitting, so whether you take the rest home for lunch the next day, or just split with your dining companion, this is honestly cheaper than even fast food.   Gotta say, though, the fried twinkies were lame. I guess thats what we get for ordering something so ridiculous."}
{"text":"Still a great place. I'm fortunate to live close by this location which is noticeably better than the other locations, especially Columbus-Easton. Sadly, this place becomes less cool every time they open a new location in a suburban strip-mall (Avon, Belden Village, really?!). This place used to be a draw and a must-do in Cleveland. For now, just about everyone in every droll part of Ohio can find one.  I still love it here but I fear their over-expansion will harm them one day and I'd hate to see the Lakewood location close but soon enough it won't even be the only westside location anymore.  Oh! And why do they close so early?! This place would be a hit late on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Great place to go. Food is heavy, almost enough for two meals. Service is always good. Four star is because the Cleveland Cheese Steak I had last night was just okay."}
{"text":"I've eaten at two of Melt's locations several times. I keep ordering the same thing because \"if something's not broke, don't fix it\" So do yourself a favor and order the Monte Cristo. I know this one is a bit \"out there\" but you won't be disappointed. The prices are super reasonable and the beer choices are extensive. Staff is usually friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty cool, lots of beers to choose from. I had the porboy melt. Lots of flavor but way too much bread to make it worth the price. My sandwich had a total of 6 small shrimp buried in the bread & four hush puppies along with a pretty tasty sauce. Not worth the 12.50. Tomato Garlic soup was also tasty.  Come for the beer but I'm not a fan of the signature food the Melt."}
{"text":"I love this place. It was one of the most refreshing atmosphere's that i have encountered since i moved back to Ohio. The food is always spot on. I usually order the Big Popper which is heaven in my mouth but I try to get a new sandwich every other visit. They are all good and being a Vegetarian it is nice to have SO MANY options!   I here a lot of complaints about the wait, and them selling out and what not but... It has always been busy since i started patterning this spot and the wait is not that bad. Pony up to the bar and it's amazing selection. Everyone who works there is super nice and ready for conversation no matter how busy it gets. If drinking is not your thing it is within walking distance to a ton of antique stores and second hand shops as well as a record exchange. I suggest going in the winter so you can taste the marvel that is \"Mighty Macaroni.\"   So on a end note... Melt...? Oh god please yes!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! One of the best sandwiches I've ever had (backyard bbq). Multiple craft beer options, really enjoyed the heavy seas winter storm. Overall a great dining experience. Will be back again."}
{"text":"The best drink specials and draft list in Cleveland. Ridiculously awesome food. Friendly staff. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Dear Melt,      Your food, beer selection and general take on the restaurant biz is A-OK.   Dear Melt Bar Staff,     You suck so bad it makes me sad. I will continue to frequent your establishment because I enjoy your tasty beer and relatively low douche factor, but I've pretty much given up on receiving anything other than poop and pee service."}
{"text":"Over the past three years, I've been to all three locations while visiting my daughter. She moved back home but didn't bring Melt Bar and Grill with her !!!  Alas Cheesy Sandwiches, I miss you all so much. I have an exceptional idea. Come to NJ. The Garden State will welcome you with ready forks and knives."}
{"text":"An hour wait on the meal once seated then my fiance gets the privilege of chewing on a hair in her first bite. Upon discussing this with who I believed to be a manager she commented on the wait to which he proceeded to debate instead of addressing the hygiene issue regarding the hair. Will never return. Will share this experience with any one that brings this place up."}
{"text":"Lets just say this outright, the wait SUCKS.  However, the sometimes 2+ hour wait is completely worth the deliciousness that is a Melt sandwich.  Where else can you get such amazing gourmet grilled cheese such as the Paramgeddon??   I'm not one for cole slaw but their slaw is dry (not saucy) and it's sweet, spicy and crunchy all at the same time.  Their fries are divine and their atmosphere is one of a kind.  The menus are posted on the back of old record albums, the windows have silverware fused into them , the lighting is dim and the decorations are old light up lawn ornaments from all holidays.  It is a great place to go with friends on an evening out but you definitely do have to be prepared to be a little hungry but if you're over 21 the bar boasts some of the best drinks in the area and you can definitely wait over convo and a great drink."}
{"text":"I have a gluten allergy and was very explicit with my server that I needed the gluten free bread, my peanut butter sandwich prepared separately, and make sure that the side salad I substituted my fries with didn't have any croutons. My first plate arrived and as I took my first bite, I noticed their were croutons in my salad. After trying to track down my waiter, I finally explained that I needed a new meal. 30 minutes later I received my 2nd plate. No croutons, but both the bananas and the bread were burnt. Yum. At this point my friend had already finished eating and I just wanted to go. When I got my bill, not only is there a $2 up charge for gluten free bread (which I new about) but there was a $3 charge for my salad, which I did not know about. The fact that I had to order the salad because I cannot eat the fries because they are fried in a shared fryer, and then up charged for that is ridiculous. Not to mention the inconvenience of having to eat by myself. The manager came over and adjusted my bill by taking off the $3 salad charge, but I'm amazed that my bill was more expensive than my friend's who had the same order as me, just without the gluten free option, when it was my meal that was essentially wrong twice. I tipped my waiter and left but I'm not going back nor would I recommend Melt to anyone who has a food allergy. I'm uploading pictures of both my first meal and my second burnt meal."}
{"text":"Been here twice, both times it was delicious. I love their seared ahi sandwich."}
{"text":"Again swayed by Man vs. Food I was not disappointed. This is probably the best thing that Cleveland has to offer and probably the only reason to go to Cleveland in the first place. I love everything about this place the kitsch decor with the local artistic creations. The hot tattooed barmen, the almost rockabilly blonde waitress. But the best thing about this place is the grilled cheese sandwiches that are so HUGE you will cower into the pit of your own stomach through pure juicy intimidation. My sandwich was the Westside Monte Cristo a ham, turkey, swiss and american sandwich which is crispy battered and fried to perfection. It sits like a mountain on a mound of fries and comes with it's own berry dipping sauce. It is the best thing I've had in a very long time. Only problem was I could only eat about half and but I was so attached to the rest of it I refused to throw it out and drove it through half the country and even put it in the fridge when I finally got back to NYC three days later. It's still in the back of my fridge now probably growing into something that will remind me that I ate well..once.."}
{"text":"I've been to the college version of this place (Melt University) many times, so I wanted to try the real deal. It's sooo good! Pretty good portions and they have several different types of grilled cheese. Even more, they have a vegetarian & vegan option for almost everything. The only thing is that they open at 4pm (on weekdays I believe?), but that's not a huge deal. I'll definitely be coming back a lot."}
{"text":"you get what you give people..  the last time i stood waiting for a table at melt, pretty much the entire hour was filled with disregard, disrespect and utter rudeness towards the staff.  i keep thinking about this and it upsets me.  people there were questioning how they were being kept track of and i couldn't get away from complaining people.  plan ahead, plan to deal with large crowds, there is a reason why there are so many people there.. the food is WONDERFUL.. in your rush rush life, keep your pants on and enjoy the experience of being in an awesome establishment that we are lucky enough to have here in lakewood.  not to mention that you are building up the hunger that you will need to conquer a massive amount of bread and cheese.  if you still feel like you are ready for a rumble with the gal holding the clipboard.. consider the atmosphere and ambiance of your dining room table and get it to go! so happy to see vegan and veg. options all of the time now!  & look forward to the special sammies every month.  this is the perfect place to take out of towners because they will refer to it every time they see or talk to you afterwards.  this is a sandwich place first and foremost but don't forget about the pierogies, ask for chili on your fries and save room for fried twinkies too!"}
{"text":"Melt was really hyped up as an amazing grilled cheese place, but my experience there did not live up to that. The bread on both my boyfriend and I's sandwiches were soggy, and not even a little soggy pretty much falling apart soggy. Both sandwiches were ok but certainly not deserving of a better adjective. We tried it once since it was so talked about, but won't be back."}
{"text":"It's the Ben and Jerry's of Sandwiches - witty names, innovative sandwiches, and a very friendly and relaxed ambiance."}
{"text":"One of my favorites from living in Cleveland. I miss it. Personal favorite - the Big Popper, one of the few sandwiches I've actually managed to finish. Normally I would go with the intention of having lunch the next day. I would suggest ordering to-go, the wait is usually at least a half hour during dinner time or on the weekend. Another highlight of this place, the staff, who all seem to care and genuinely enjoy their jobs."}
{"text":"Have to update this review since I now realize after going yesterday that the menu has changed.  Now they have gone  a la cart with their sandwiches.  I usually only get 2 of the sandwiches, but by the time I add the stuff from the build a sandwich menu I'm paying more than I previously paid for the sandwich which was already high.  I asked the bartender why they did this and she said she wasn't sure but that several people have expressed the dislike for the changes.  She offered to get the manager, but I declined because he wasn't going to change the menu for us.  We left yesterday and will more than likely not return."}
{"text":"Anything you want in grilled cheese form, delicious.  The service, even better! Be prepared to wait, worth every minute. Great beer list too."}
{"text":"just look at the menu. i must say this is biased because this is my favorite restaurant - if you haven't been here, go!!!!!! best grilled cheese in the world!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is so heavy and greasy that you need a day to recover after eating just half of it. The flavor combinations just don't do it for me.  It's just, mmm, okay. Nothing special.  When it comes to leftovers, the sandwiches tend to harden.  We always end up tossing them out. Sorry to say it is no longer worth the price and wait in our book.   When I say to my boys, \"we can go to the melt if you want?\"  They just look at me blankly and then say, \"naahh, let's just get a pizza\"."}
{"text":"stopped in when I had to travel for Cleveland to work....all I can say is, WOW! I have never been anywhere like Melt in my life.    First of all, be prepared for a wait, and a big, overwhelming crowd.  I ended up sitting at the bar just to avoid the long wait - well worth the hassle of eating at the bar rather than a full size table.  however, the big crowds and overwhelming wait time (we were told two hours for a wait for a party of two on a random monday evening!)  I just went with the Kindergarten, and added bacon and sauteed onions. I have never had a grilled cheese like this one. it was absolutely massive, delicious, full of delicious and fresh ingredients, and made with lots of cheeses - mmmmmmmm.    the fresh-cut fries are awessoommeeee.  way too big of a serving for any normal-sized person to ever eat, but delicious, freshly-cut, and perfectly seasoned.   i am not a cole slaw fan, but all sandwiches are served with both cole slaw and fries.   guy fieri visited this spot with diners, drive ins, and dives.  i suppose this spot is considered a \"dive\" with the somewhat haphazard decorations, license plates tacked everywhere, and \"hipster-cool\" vibe.   recommendations: ask for different types of cheese on your grilled cheese - you can have 2, 3, 4, or more different flavors on the same sandwich, regardless of the type called for on the menu (there is a small charge, but well worth the cheesy deliciousness).  also, if you are with a small group, walk right in and sit at the bar. this will cut your wait time by 100%.  also, go in with an absolutely empty stomach. you will leave happy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here.   I don't care that it was on tv or the \"hype\" everyone talks about.  Get over it, stop trying to be cool by disliking a place because it is popular.    We went at 11am on Saturday and had no wait but it quickly filled up.  Our server was friendly and checked on us several times.  The appetizers I thought were overpriced for what you got.  However, the sandwiches are a good deal.  You get fresh hand cut fries, seasoned, and you get a ton of them.  The slaw was pretty good but I didn't eat too much.  I had the spinach pie sandwich but changed the cheese.  The bread was excellent.  For $8 it was a great lunch, better than most places that serve frozen fries, par-baked bread, frozen veggies, etc.  I definitely agree that a 1-2 hour wait for any food is absurd and not worth it."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Melts today. We were looking forward to enjoying an amazing meal, we traveled 45 minutes to get there because we heard great things about it.  It was a huge disappointment, at first the server was very nice and friendly, she explained that she would be there to put in our order and get us drinks but then another girl would be taking over for change of shift, which was fine. The girl who brought us our food dumped my sons whole plate of food all over the table and him, then my niece found a long hair nestled in her french fries, which was not hers! By that time we were just grossed out.  The food we got to eat was just OK, nothing to brag about. Then the bill came and we were over charged for drinks that were supposed to be included in the kids order and when I mentioned it to the server she got an instant attitude and ripped the receipt out of my hand...maybe she was upset she had to stay because the girl who was to come in never came. We did not get an apology for the hair or the food dump... just an oops I will bring you another plate.  By the time my son got another plate everyone else was done. Very bad! Not recommended and will never go back!"}
{"text":"Such a weird location, but the food was good. Same wait as the other locations. Busy lunch crowd and expect a long wait for dinner but the portions are huge and always taste great."}
{"text":"So much food!! Never disappointed at Melt Bar and Grilled."}
{"text":"I've eaten at both locations, but this was the site of the most recent trip.  I will say that Melt is an experience - the interesting decor (the menus are glued to the back of old record sleeves - genius?  I think so!), the even more interesting menu options, the beer list - the entire set up is crafted to make you feel like this is one of the most unique places you've ever eaten at.    For a girl who isn't too keen on cheese (I know what you're thinking...I get it all the time), I love this place.  The food is OH SO GOOD and totally innovative.  My absolute favorite Parmageddon - a grilled cheese sandwich complete with pierogi and kraut??   SIGN ME UP!  And if you're a beer lover, then you'll be one happy, soon to be stuffed diner because there are TONS of options for you to choose from.     My only gripe about this place is the location.  Situated at the corner of a pretty congested intersection, getting here is no easy task.  Parking is limited so be prepared to be royally frustrated before you even set foot in the place.  Also be prepared to wait for a table - hey, what do you expect when you've got a sandwich called the Godfather on the menu?  I would say practice some patience and give this place a go because it's totally worth it.  P.S. If you're daring enough, try the challenge!  It's not that expensive and totally worth the story once it's over.  Just remember not to drink too much because you can't leave the table once this monster hits the table!"}
{"text":"I've been to the original Melt when it was the only Melt in town. Liked it better then. Have been to the Rockside location twice. Will not return. Just meh. Fries were a bit overdone. Sandwich was big, enough for leftovers, and it was tasty, but the whole place is overpriced. My biggest beef with Melt, no pun intended, is how a patron will be charged for extra ingredients that get suggested to them, as in having to pay for ranch dressing. I have absolutely no problem with paying an additional nominal fee for fancy condiments. What I object to is that while the servers ask if you want something extra, as in ranch, they fail to mention that there will be a charge. Or at least the server for our table didn't. Just be up front about it. Is okay, I'll pay the extra $ but don't want to there to be any surprises at the end of the meal. Doesn't make me feel valued as a patron."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the atmosphere is great.  The wait is long but they tell you ahead of time.  Skip the wait and sit at the bar, there are plenty of tv's to watch and the other people there are friendly."}
{"text":"While not as charming a locale as the West side location, they have clearly learned a thing or two about how to run a crazy busy restaurant that doesn't take reservations: half the place is a giant bar that you can drink at while you wait. And this is no doubt part of the charm of Melt. By the time you eat your sandwich, you're two IPAs in, and greasy food is guaranteed to taste good. But you don't need beer goggles. These slices of cheese between giant slices of white bread toasted with butter are just fantastic.   Of course, many people complain about the wait. I can say that over the last year, the wait time has decreased dramatically (don't everyone rush over, now...).   Our standby favorite sandwiches include:  - Chorizo,  - PBJ with banana and extra Bacon.  - Winter Chicken - Big Popper (spicy deep fried sandwich) - Kindergarden (Try it! Just cheese and bread, but it shows why everything is good) - The burgers are all excellent.   That's a third of the menu, so it's really hard to go wrong. The specials are often equally fantastic, my favorite being the turkey dinner around thanksgiving. A slice of sweet potato never tasted so good.   But why five stars? I mean, five stars? Well last time I went, I ordered the blue cheese burger RARE. As in, I'm sick of getting hockey pucks (from other establishments), so I want to make it clear this thing should be at least pink. Of course, the burger came out RARE, and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. The meat was so good, it really was the right way to eat it."}
{"text":"I think I'm gonna have to get the MELT Tattoo.   For those deterred by the wait, dive into the awesome beer selection. Particularly good are their IPAs.   Can't wait for the Cleveland Heights location to open up."}
{"text":"I have been to Melt twice in the past year when I come to Cleveland to visit friends.  The first time I had take out (ham and cheese) and the second time I ate at the restaurant )the new turkey bomb) .  The food is just ok, certainly not worth the long wait.  Its a good experience to say you ate there if your from out of town but if i lived in Cleveland I would not be a regular.  Would I go back...?  Sure the food and atmosphere is good enough to get my attention again but I would only go back if I got there early enough for a short wait"}
{"text":"The choices are mind boggling here. I usually end up having their special. Tonight I chose 6 degrees of Kevin bacon. Amazingly awesome. My gf tried the chicken parm. The only problem with this company is they can't ever make fries or cole slaw correctly. Fries always taste like they've been sitting forever or over cooked. The cole slaw just tastes terrible. It's almost like they just needed a third option and decided just toss some stuff together leaving dry and peppery. Pick the chips or no side"}
{"text":"Gotta try this place.  Good prices, unreal food, and a lot of different beer types.  The sandwiches are soooo good, and ridiculously big!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We've been there quite a few times. It's one of those places I like to take family when they visit. Bennigans was never a great restaurant, but they had one thing going for them, the Monte Cristo. Once they closed I couldn't get my fix until we found out about Melt. Melt has the best Monte I've ever had. They're big, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and just plain delicious. The hand cut fries are pretty good too. You get quite a bit of food for the price so I can always get 2 meals out of mine.   I love the atmosphere here, right down to the tacky holiday ornaments that decorate the place. The servers are all really friendly and always have our food, and anything else we need, out quickly and accurately. I'm feeling like I'm going to have to go back soon. I'm making myself hungry."}
{"text":"Two of us went on a Saturday at 2:45 and were told the wait was an hour and a half.  I am not sure when you could go and be seated in a reasonable amount of time.  I don't think any grilled cheese sandwich could be worth that.  So, the review is for policy/process and not food since we left."}
{"text":"Second time at the new Melt in Avon and don't think I'll be back. The sandwiches are good but the rules they have are crazy! 1st time they wouldn't bring tables together in an empty section because upper management said they can't do that to accommodate larger parties and made us wait till tables opened up in another area. 2nd time my 9 year old wanted to add a little ham and bacon to a $4.00 kids sandwich and they up-charged me and additional $6.50. When I asked the manager why so much, he tried to explain that they add an adult portion size. I could have just order and adult sandwich for less money!! Figure it out Melt or your days in Avon will be numbered"}
{"text":"Holy heck, the food is great at this place! We got there at just the right time though. When we got there we were told it was a hour and a half wait, but it was only 20 minutes or so in reality. By the time we left it was a 3 hour wait, but for real. Everyone should go here at least once, but get there early."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place!!! I got the lasagna sandwich and my hubby got the meatloaf one.. both were incredible.. my friend got the chicken and waffles one and hers was hands down the best! The portions were ridiculously amazing, and the quality of food was beyond what I expected. The drink selection was also pretty fabulous! We took our leftovers home, and I was able to make 2 more meals out of them! So impressed!!"}
{"text":"I was here 3 years ago and insisted we stop this time on our way to Pennsylvania.  I wasn't disappointed!  The food is amazing, the quantity over the time and the service far above par.  I hope I can get to Ohio in less than 3 years this time.  I am confused by the reviewer who said she had maggots in her food.  #1, Maggots only hatch on raw food and don't leave the food they hatch on; #2, If they were on the raw food, why didn't they cook with the food.   I am also amazed she didn't tell the management.  I read this review before I went and still couldn't wait to get there.....and can't wait until I can come back again.  Ever think of opening one in California?!?"}
{"text":"Outstanding as hell. Sandwiches are tremendous, fries are dang rockin. Good brews. Excellent atmosphere. It's just fun as heck."}
{"text":"We have tried Melt twice and I was not impressed either time.  Jamming piles of mediocre ingredients on a bun (fries do not belong IN a sandwich) does not make a decent meal. I'm done with melt."}
{"text":"The amazing Melt. My goal is to eat everything on the menu assuming I don't clog my arteries first. That said, it would be worth it.  I've still got a few to go but I've had the majority of their sandwiches.  Let's talk about the wait and just get it out of the way. I've never waited for a table at Melt. What's my secret? Don't go when everyone is  The fact is you should expect a wait when you go to a popular place at night. (I once waited 90 minutes for mediocre Olive Garden but that's another story.) My recommendation is to hit it between 2 and 5:30 during the week and before 1 on the weekends. You should at least find a bar seat using this strategy. Second, you can wait awhile for the food. Some days are faster than others. The kitchen is extremely tiny which is why they eliminated the brunch menu. Quite bluntly, the kitchen didn't have the space to do it. It's Melt's biggest flaw but it's not a big deal and neither is meter parking. Get out of the burbs and into the city, folks! :) And if you have to walk a little for a parking spot, well thats good considering the pounds of cheese devoured at Melt.   Now, let's focus on drinks. Melt has one of the best beer selections in town. Anytime I see someone drinking a Bud in here, I wanna go over there and slap them. There are too many amazing beers here and they are priced very reasonably. If you want something softer, they a terrific selection of classic soft drinks from Yoohoo to Birch beer and Sasparilla. No reason to stick to plain old Pepsi here.   Now, we get to the food and I don't consider Melt gourmet. There are gourmet grilled cheese places in the USA and Melt doesn't stack up to them for the most part. I do think Melt IS creative and it's darn tasty too. My personal favs are the Parmageddon and the Godfather. You also can't go wrong with the specials of the month. The only one that's disappointed me so far is the BBQ Chicken.   Melt's fries are great and to those who complain that the slaw is dry, well it's supposed to be! Its not deli coleslaw. The slaw here is Asian vinegar which is meant to cut down on the cheese and the grease. It seems that some people are missing the point of it and are expecting creamy summer slaw which it isn't supposed to be. Melt's bread is yummy and it's one of the most vegan and food allergy friendly places in town. It is hard to ever make it to dessert here but take home the fried twinkies. Your stomach will thank you later.   I've always had good service here. I'd like to see a half sandwich/salad option besides the kindergarten on the menu but that's a minor quibble. Melt is a casual fun place and I'd recommend it to even the pickiest of eaters."}
{"text":"I used to be a HUGE melt fan but lately I have left very disappointed. It started a couple of years ago when there was a noticeable change in the quality of the French fries. We visited this location last week and had poor service (sitting at the bar) and the food was below average. My kindergarten grilled cheese was hardly grilled and the cheese barely melted. I have been less than impressed with the recent quality at this location. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had to come to Cleveland on business figured we would try Melt since we've heard good things about how great it is. Not so impressed sandwiches were tasty although not what all the hype was about it is very noisy,they have many beers to choose from which is good , to over priced for a sandwich."}
{"text":"It was awesome. Fun atmosphere great beer selection and great comfort food. I had the godfather. It is lasagna between two pieces of garlic bread. It was as delicious as it sounds."}
{"text":"Melt is...it 's hard to say.  I heard of Melt from several friends and the obvious, from the Food Network. I have been meaning to try this establishment for some time now, but first time I ventured there it was a 2 hour wait. They do not take reservations or call ahead seating, needless to say it took me sometime to swallow the pill of a hour plus wait for a diner-esque restaurant. But something came about to just do it (might of been the man vs. food episode I just saw).   I went on a weekday around 6:30pm and the wait was an hour to an hour and a half, I finally swallowed the pill and waited. The waiting area is plenty big for a a large crowd to wait, there is also plenty of TVs to watch and pass the time. At about an 1hour on the dot we were seated. This is the first time I realized how small the eating area is and this is the sole reason the waits are an extreme hour plus. We waited about 5 mins til our waiter arrived and asked what we wanted to drink. Their beer list, is massive, any type of beer you can think of they most likely have it.   The menu is large with many of choices not just the specialized grill cheese they focus on. I order the Hot Italian which is a Italian sub on large bread and tons of cheese. It was amazing. The fries were good, the coleslaw was good, and the portions are huge.  With the massive wait, the hipster environment, great beer selection, and amazing food, Melt is a unique, wonderful Cleveland area restaurant. I would suggest you to go, but it is a marathon of a wait, which is why I gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"want to taste what the fuss is about?   good luck.   between a serving staff of dim witted lifestylers and the atrocious waste of dining space you are looking at well over an hour to get a table and food.  and you know what... even after that you are still getting a grilled sandwich.  a very good grilled sandwich but not one worth spending half your evening/afternoon waiting to eat."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, good service. I had the parmegeddon, which was really good.  Potato & onion pierogi, grilled onions, sharp cheddar,& Napa valley vodka kraut. Very filling. Wild turkey bourbon barrel stout. Fries and a pickle. Great lunch!"}
{"text":"We have been to several Melt locations prior to this one in Avon opening. The food and drinks were excellent both times we have stopped in for lunch. My husband usually gets the Cleveland cheese steak and I usually mix it up. Tried the buffalo chicken chowder instead of fries and it was so good. Also tried the chicken and waffles for the first time- took the other half home for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Long waits! Come early!  Portions are HUMONGO. I'm not always in the mood for Melt, but when I am... it really hits the spot. I recently ordered their thanksgiving turkey/stuffing/cranberry special, which was realllllyy filling. The turkey to stuffing ratio was spot on, but overall the sandwich was just a little too greasy."}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday night around 4 pm . The wait for our table want bad maybe 15-20 mins. The experience went down hill once we were seated. First the tables are entirely too close you can bearly walk through the resturant and we were seated so close to the neighboring tables we were able to speak up converstaion they were in less than arms reach on both sides ( we sat along the windows). Second problem was we waited aleast another 25 mins before the server even acknowledged us . It was so bad that the lady at the table next to us actually said something to the waiter for us. So that automatically put me in a bad mood but we stayed. She wasnt very friendly she just took our order and was done no specials nothing . The food came out fast considering. Food was awesome the fries were good as usual and the sandwiches are massive . I had the Cleveland Cheese Steak and my date had the El Diablo Burger both were good  too much food but very good. I wouldnt visit again because it is still new to the area and the service was horrible so to wait and then have crappy service I will just avoid this location until the newness simmers down. I guess I'll have to venture to the Cleveland Heights location . 3 stars only because of the extremly bad service ."}
{"text":"Melt is an awesome place to eat. It is unlike anything you'll find in Greater Cleveland. It's located at the intersection of Detroit and Warren in Lakewood. There is not much space inside, which is a problem as it has been packed both times that I've been here, one of those being during the Easter Snowstorm with every road in the area buried in snow. You can sit at the bar or at one of the tables, although if you can, sit at the bar. It's much easier. There is a great variety of things to be found on the TVs. Some of the things I've seen on during my two visits here include Scrubs, Animal Planet, Spongebob, Toy Story, and Fox 8 News, as well as any sporting event that's of any interest to Clevelanders. The menu features grilled cheese, burgers, soups, and salads. The grilled cheeses are the specialty. If you go to Melt, get a grilled cheese. The last time I was here, I had the Parmageddon. It was a huge sandwich (they all are) stuffed with pierogies, sauerkraut, peppers, and american cheese. It came with a huge, delicious serving of fries. It was phenominal. You would never expect such a sandwich to taste so good. Just like the rest of their sandwiches, it is very unique. The only complaint was that it took forever for our food to come on both trips, but the place was packed both times and it was well worth it. Overall, if you want to eat in a fun environment and have great, high quality food, stop in at Melt. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A delicious twist on the classic grilled cheese- a far cry from the waxy, yellow Kraft Single slapped between two buttered pieces of toasted white bread...  On a recent visit to Cleveland, we made it to Melt, which was made known to us by Man V. Food. The place was packed- we put our name in and waited with about 30 others for a table. We figured we could be really efficient if we looked at the menu so that we knew exactly what to order, but it wasn't that easy. Everything on the menu sounded so good that 60-90 min after I thought i had made up my mind, I was tongue-tied when the waiter asked what i wanted to order. I made a quick decision, and ordered the Westside Monte Cristo. It was probably one of the best last-minute decisions i ever made. This gourmet grilled cheese sandwich had ham, turkey, swiss and american cheese between 2 thick slices of white bread that was then beer-battered and deep fried. YUM. To top it off, they give you a side of berry preserves for the perfect combination of sweet and salty and chewy and crunchy.  All of us were satisfied with our orders, but I don't think you can really go wrong at Melt. The portions are huge (I barely touched the fries and slaw that come with the sandwiches) and the servers are fun and full of energy."}
{"text":"kick ass food great service!!!!! I will be going back a lot"}
{"text":"Few places get as much hype and TV airtime, but Melt does not disappoint.  I had the Parmageddon which contains Pierogies INSIDE the grilled cheese sandwich. They'd get 5 stars if not for the rude front host staff.  Yes, you're busy and don't NEED the business, but you can still be polite, otherwise your clients will turn on you!"}
{"text":"This place surprised me in the best way, and now I can't stop raving about it! I had of course seen the tv spots done on food network, and figured it would be worth visiting the next time I was in Cleveland. I even endured a 45 minute wait for a table (something I don't generally do, I'm rather impatient). It was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time! The atmosphere is relaxed and rather artsy, and the service was quick and accommodating. My only difficulty was trying to figure out what to order. I finally weighed my options and got the Godfather (freaking lasagna on a grilled cheese!) and the soup. Both were amazing!  Since my first visit, I waited a week and a half and made the two-hour drive for the sole purpose of visiting this restaurant. Second time around I got the Big Popper, and went to heaven in a melty cream cheese daze. And the roasted garlic tomato soup will definitely be getting ordered again! Each time I was floored by how low the bill was, in a GOOD way. How could such tremendous food be so cheap, and there was enough there that I got two meals out of it each time! I was not disappointed at all, and I'm currently in the process of converting as many Erie-ites as possible."}
{"text":"I love Melt, but I'm starting to feel like they should change their \"grilled cheese\" menu to a \"grilled sandwiches\" menu. They're starting to focus a little too much on all the awesome, deliciousness that can go on a sandwich, and they're getting away from the cheese. For example, the Shrimp Po Boy? Tasty, yes. Cheesy? No. I'd say less hushpuppy, more pepper jack!  Still an amazing draught list, still delicious sandwiches and fries! More cheese. Less frills.  Oh, and completely contradictory to my review. What happened to the Rising Sun? That was my jam! Still needed more cheese."}
{"text":"Awesome food, even more awesome beer selection. One of the best bars I've ever been to. The downside is the wait for the food. Almost one hour is what it took for the food to come but once it did, it was incredible. Make sure you get appetizers before you eat because it will be awhile.  The waiters were cool and so were the bartenders. Been there twice and will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wear some of your food - this was one messy sandwich.   I'm in town for work and I overheard someone at the hotel bar talking about it, and how Melt had been on Man vs Food.  The guy at the hotel bar didn't actually get to try the food, as he was apparently stood in the wrong area of the bar and was promptly ignored for 15 minutes before deciding to leave.   Anyway, I decided to give it a shot - I turned up at a little after 6 and the place was packed.  As I was a billy-no-mates I went to the bar to find a spot and had somewhat better luck that hotel-bar-guy.  I ordered from the very large list of beers, as well as a Blackened Chicken Melt. Food took a long time coming but it looked good when it arrived.  The sandwich is huge, and came with a pile of home made skin-on fries - as well as coleslaw.   I couldn't get anyone's attention to get any silverware for a good while, so I tucked into the fries and sandwich, until I managed to eventually get silverware in order to try the coleslaw. I didn't care for the coleslaw at all, so that got left on the plate - to be fair, I rarely like coleslaw, mayonnaise covered, or otherwise. They did, however, have malt vinegar on the table which, as a Brit, is pretty much a mandatory addition to 'chips'.  I enjoyed the first half of the sandwich - bread was good, chicken was tender, fixin's were tasty - but as I bit into the 2nd half of my monstrous sarnie it occurred to me just how much of paprika, or maybe chili powder, it tasted.  Once I'd had that thought I couldn't shake it, and I definitely didn't enjoy it as much as the first half.   In any case, yay for the beer selection, yay for the interesting sounding menu, boo for the spotty service (I'm going to suggest that this was the fault of the level of staffing to some degree though), and so-so for the food."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch (2:30pm) on a weekday while on a road trip because of the hype. ;)  Had a 20-minute wait for a table.  We ordered the grilled mushroom and arugula melt with an added order of pork belly plus a small side salad - -  two adults shared that and we still couldn't finish the salad. HUGE meal portions!  The sandwich was delicious - - lots of veg filling (which we wanted) but the pork was a wee bit skimpy I thought (or maybe my half of the sandwich had less than my husbands half?).  The decor is fun, and the waitstaff did a good job."}
{"text":"They changed their closing time via a sign on the door bc of the football game. We were visiting from Pittsburgh and really hoping to try this place. They wouldn't seat us after we drove all the way there, even though their doors were open and they had just seated some other people. There were several people still in there SOME of which had not even ordered yet. No thanks melt. I'm sure I can make a Damn good grilled cheese at home! They also display a big yelp sticker on their door. They never bothered to let yelp know they were closing at 6pm. They are listed to have been open until 2am."}
{"text":"Wow, tons of good food and delicious.  If you love grilled cheese, then you need to eat here."}
{"text":"Melt is the place that I take anyone who comes into the Cleveland area who I think will like something that is just really off the wall and comforting all at the same time.  The food is fantastic - I have never had anything bad here.  If it is on the menu, you will eat it and enjoy it....    (place comment about wait for seats here) - While it was not the owners fault that he created a great restaurant, this is a problem.  I would not mind the wait so much if not for one thing - if you are hanging out after you finish your meal, and you see that about 40 parties are waiting to eat, get the f up from the table and go somewhere else to have a drink after you eat.  Melt has a bar area to drink at - drink there....  Okay, now that I got that off my chest, to summarize the review.  Yeah. Good place....Try to get there early.  If you eat there, respect the fact that other people want to eat too."}
{"text":"lunch - 12/20/11.  I encountered great friendly service,a  fun menu and format, and high-quality comfort food meal (for me, it was the chorizo and potato sandwich with jalapenos, which proved to be more than enough to feed two people).  Got there at the start of a weekday lunch (11am), which was very efficient  but (alas) also turned out to be too early (by my personal clock) to order a beer!  Whatever your beverage of choice, though, I can't imagine needing or wanting  to order an appetizer in addition to the sandwich!  Chill out, relax, and enjoy...rock on.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"everyone should go once.  great 80s vibe. good bar offerrings.  beyond that \"melt\"  is a novelty. used to be awesome years ago. now it's just \"trendy.\""}
{"text":"Melt is my favorite. If I've ever craved food from any restaurant, it's been a chorizo and potato (with jalapenos!)  from Melt.   I love you Melt."}
{"text":"This is THE place to eat in Cleveland!  Tons of great sandwiches, great beer selection, and an awesome atmosphere.   An upscale, hipstery, grilled-cheese restaurant might not sound like a brilliant idea, but Melt runs with it and owns it.  I  just moved away from Cleveland after 5 years, and this is the place that I will miss the most.  It embodies everything Cleveland does right, and has the a look and feel you won't find anywhere else.  I've tried both of Michael Symon's restaurants- the self-proclaimed 'cultural icon' of food in the area- and for $30 less a plate you can get a better and more unique entree in a much more enjoyable atmosphere at Melt.  Anywhere that has a large club of people who've tattooed the logo on themselves for a discount shouldn't be missed.    Be prepared to wait for upwards of an hour for a table (but yes, it's worth it).  Lots of parking is available around back.  If you eat one place while in Cleveland (or Ohio for that matter), make it this one.  Long Live Melt!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Melt several times over the past two years and have never been disappointed with my experience. The most recent time, I went with a group of five and had a wonderful experience. Near dinner time on a Sunday evening, we only had a to wait under an hour for our table (which is the longest we have ever had to wait there).   This past time, we ordered the Ultimate Fries appetizer, the Monte Cristo (and four other sandwiches I won't bother listing), and Red Velvet Cheesecake to top it all off. After putting in our order, the fries came out in under ten minutes, and then the sandwiches came out less than twenty minutes later. All the food was absolutely delicious. The bread on one of our sandwiches was a little bit soggy, but that is where the complaints end. Everything else came out perfectly and we indulged in greasy goodness.   We had a friendly waiter who was constantly checking in on us (I have never seen a waiter or waitress be discourteous or rude to anyone in all my times there) and making sure we were satisfied with our food. Finally, if you have been to Melt but have never had dessert there, try the Red Velvet Cheesecake next time. It is a large piece big enough to feed three people and a great way to end your meal. Overall, Melt is a great restaurant where, if you can get past the hour or so wait, you are guaranteed to have good food and a good time."}
{"text":"I love melts! I normally go to the lakewood location. The staff are always friendly and their is always a great crowd. The wait is well worth your time and money. FOOD IS AMAZING!!! Full bar and yummy food, is my kind of place! :)"}
{"text":"the food is great here. the \"grilled cheese\" sandwiches they come up with are crazy, and if you leave here hungry....well i don't know what to say. yes the wait can be crazy long, especially on weekends. parking can also be another issue. my suggestion is to stop there for lunch or later than 8pm during the week. i've gotten seated within 15mins during these times. the wait for food can be pretty long, but as others have said the kitchen is tiny....good things come to those who wait! so if you are impatient or passing out hungry, i would suggest you find somewhere else to go. but if you don't mind the wait it's worth it! i also would not suggest going here with a large group...i did once with a group of 8 and it took us about 2.5-3hrs to get seated."}
{"text":"Great beer menu, nice atmosphere but just too much.  Too much grease, too much cheese, too long of a wait.  I love to eat.  I'll eat all damn day.  Cheese, Butter.. put it on my ice cream.  But this was just overdoing it.  Oily cheese, oily bread.  Obesity, please continue your takeover of the Midwest.  The wait once you sit is also long.  This place can probably seat 150 people (total guess), but we were a table of 6 with probably 20 other people there.  Everything seemed like a wait.  Wait to order, wait for drinks, wait for food.  I see how some people will get off to 50 different kinds of grilled cheese sandwich (which is what drew me in, along with many recommendations), but this place just rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"The husband and I were in Cleveland for Thanksgiving and heard about Melt over and over again from friends and family while visiting. Being lovers of grilled cheese, we had to give it a try before flying home.  Oh.my.gosh. Can Melt please move down to Georgia? Otherwise I'm going to be visiting Cleveland a heck of a lot more often. I had the Cleveland Cheesesteak (slow roasted beef, shaved thin, garlic wild mushrooms, sautéed onions & peppers, provolone). Honestly, I felt at times like I was making love to the sandwich. That sounds nasty, but seriously...every delectable bite required great care and thought. And it was oh so amazing. More of an experience than a meal. As for my husband, he had a true carb overload with The Godfather (3 cheese lasagna, fresh fennel-oregano pasta sheets, hearty red sauce, provolone, garlic spiked bread).   The portions are staggeringly huge. I didn't even attempt to eat more than 1/3 of the french fries, which paled in comparison to the sandwich. Nevertheless, I definitely popped a few Tums before heading onward to the airport. There are so many sandwiches on the menu that I want to try but, alas, it will have to wait until another trip to Cleveland.  Minus one star for the attitude our server gave my mother-in-law when (1) she mentioned that my husband and I were under a slight time constraint to reach the airport and (2) repeated a special order request to be sure the waitress heard her over the interior noise."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings. Is Melt a great experience and the place to visit if you are visiting the area? Yes, absolutely. Gorge yourself on their huge portions and creativity.Lasagna sandwich with garlic bread as the bun? Ah-mazing.   Now, is it the place to go if you live or work nearby on a regular basis? Not particularly. It's on-par with the other businesses in the area, if a little pricey for what you get. Some of the combinations are bizarre and overwhelming (monthly items) but some are amazing and innovative.   The biggest turn-off for me is the service. It's slow. I understand the historical nature of the building as far as Melt goes; however there is a time when you should expand or build a second kitchen and that time is when it takes 90 minutes to serve soup and two appetizers BEFORE a lunch rush. The length of time takes away from the ability for working people to use this as a lunch spot."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Melt 3.5 stars.  Overall the food is unique and tastes good.  Would I wait over 2 hours for it?  No way.  If you want to go I would recommend visiting on a weekday around 2 pm.  Typically at that time there will be no wait at all.  If you go on a weekend night plan on waiting hours for a table.  I have had a few of the sandwiches on the menu and most were good.  I think the coleslaw is very good along with the fries.  The sandwiches will make you feel weighed down and fat after eating them.  The bar has some pretty cool beers and the atmosphere is very neat.  Overall a great place to visit since it is a cult favorite, but I wouldn't wait more than 30 mins."}
{"text":"Wildly overrated. I've been here 3 times and have left disappointed each time. Don't believe the hype! There are better sandwiches next door at DiBella's."}
{"text":"The food is very good with creative takes on grilled cheese, but if you eat here with any regularity you're going to shave years off your life. Looks like a good beer selection if you're into that. I try to avoid hipsters so even though I live less than a mile away I only go about once a year at most. That being said if you're visiting Cleveland, Melt is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Come for the atmosphere and original sandwiches. I was in Cleveland on business and happened to catch it on Yelp. Glad I did. I looked through the menu and decided on about 5 different things. When the waitress came over I had arrived at the chicken and waffles sandwich. Pretty good. I couldn't quite wrap my head around the deep fried Monte Carlo but came back the next day for the pork backyard bbq. Great!"}
{"text":"I travel, and sometimes I think the hotel I choose is because of this place.  There are many great reviews of this place already, so I think they speak for themselves.    I primarily do take out, so I view this establishment in a different way. The food is good, but some things do not travel well, such as the fries.  I'm sure they are good, but not after being put in a plastic container.  So I get the cole slaw.  MMMMM.  Delicious.  Want to talk about sandwiches?  Try their August Special, the Melt Pig Roast.  I may have to go back to get another one, even though I was just there two days ago.  It was sweet, and messy, and everything you want from pulled pork.   My big fat gyro meatloaf:  Had it twice.  Should have had it thrice.  A beautiful concoction of things that shouldn't go together, but do so well.  The Dude Abides:  I think I am in the minority here.  The meatballs were dry and tasteless, and the fried cheese was just a cold mess.  Parmageddon:  Just say yes.  This is worth the trip.    As I write this, I am dialing the phone right now to order again.  That's a record for me.  Twice in three days."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for the first time as asked around about a local delicatessen, Melts was mentioned most. The menu is mouthwatering and entertaining. The ambiance is fun, diverse, hip and eclectic. All the staff was genuinely concerned and extremely polite. They name you something random when you check in to await seating, which is fun,I was \"Greys Anatomy\" and there was a decent wait. Table was clean which is noteworthy due to how busy they were. I ordered the \"Big Popper\" which is a melt(grilled cheese sandwhich) with cheese, garlic herb cream stuff, fresh jalapeños on Texas toast, deep fried, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a side of a raspberry jelly like sauce. I added bacon. The presentation was an awesome eyefull, it looked like a sandwhich and a half. It smelled like a giant jalapeño popper with bacon(deliciousness). I believe it was just 1 massive sandwhich cut in away that is genius. The top portion which, I started with was, one of the side parts of the sandwhich, it was heavy on the garlic herb stuff, light on cheese and bacon and no jalapeño. It was all dough and bread. I dropped it aside and grabbed the middle stack, which visibly had jalepenos stacked in it. The initial flavor was almost perfect, which quickly was removed from the fire of fresh jalapeños. I like spicy but this was overkill. After a stuffed some fries in my face and drank my sons chocolate milk, I investigated the masterpiece. It was poorly prepared. The ingredients were not consistent nor acknowledgeable in every bite, in fact not one bite had the desired flavor that I knew the creator of this beast would have wanted. It was rushed to put together and unfortunately not that good. If your staple is to sell big over priced grilled cheese dandies, packed with flavors the least you could do was execute. It was a disappointment especially when I got the check. I spent $42 for a party of 2 on some  grilled cheese sandwhiches. The fries were fantastic and they have malt vinegar on every table but it didn't surpass the problem with the melt. The person who made it jut didn't care, it was like a scoop of fresh jalapeños in the middle, too much garlic and herb stuff and not enough cheese or bacon. The raspberry sauce was watery. Great idea poorly executed. My wife tried the \"hot buffalo\" She enjoyed it thoroughly, I looked at it and didn't see the cheese I was expecting but she liked it. We will return again one day, I will make my own sandwhich an my wife will attempt their challenge. I believe that if the guy that created the sandwhich I ordered, had prepared it for me, I would be a 5 stars. It's a giant popper, this sandwhich could be amazazing!"}
{"text":"Well, we went opening night, and it was crazy. We put our names on the list and we were told that it would be a four hour wait. It ended up being a 2 hour wait. So, that isn't too bad.  My complaints is that they were not utilizing their space properly. They had more than enough space to wait, as in, it was bigger than the section for tables. After that, the bar was huge. There just was not a lot of seating. They could definately have added at least 5-8 more tables for guests and still had enough space for those waiting for a table.   The food is good, we waited maybe 20-30 minutes for our food to come out. The food was tasty. We picked out the Hot Italian and a burger with muenster cheese. Both were good. Came with plenty of fries and slaw. We definately came home with leftovers!"}
{"text":"I love coming here(Lakewood) with my friends from time to time. The service is always excellent; the perfect combination of individuality and class. Also, the portion v. Price is excellent. I've had the Italian, the Parma,and jalapeño sandwiches respectively. All of them were excellent."}
{"text":"I Went to Melt a few days ago to get take out.  I ordered the Westside Monte Cristo.  They told me it would be about 20 minutes, so I took a seat on one of the large church pews they have for guests waiting to be sat.  It was about 4:30 on a Monday and there was no wait.  I was expecting there to be a crowd at the door.  I over herd a phone call asking about if there was a wait and the man taking the call jokingly told them to run and get down here as fast as you can.  Shortly after that my food was up. I was pleasantly surprised because it had only been about 10 minutes.  The food was amazing.  They have delicious large homemade fries that have a little crunch to them.  The sandwich itself was beyond belief.  It was ham, turkey, american and swiss in between to two thick pieces of bread.  Then it is deep fried and served with a berry preserve dipping sauce.   The prices are fairly cheap.  The Monte Cristo was the most expensive item on the menu and it was only 10 dollars.  I highly recommend Melt Bar and Grilled to anyone who is in the area looking for great food at cheap prices in a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are sinfully large and fattening.  May only be able to handle them once a year, but will probably meet my quota.  Try the Monte Cristo for sure!"}
{"text":"Hi All,  My hubby and me are avid foodies.. we love to experiment on new types of food and have been to many many different restauarants, diners etc  and have always throughly enjoyed the place.  We watched Melt on Food Network in Diners Drive ins and dives. We stay in California , this long weekend we decided to go over to Ohio to meet friends and were thrilled to try the Grilled Cheese at Melt , but our visit was a big disaster right from the ridiculous wait time till the food.  When  we arrived at melt we were given a one and half hour wait time.. which is normal as far as all the reviews below.  I guess they should start taking reservations so people don't have to come and wait at the restaurant for long period. So we waited for 90 minutes almost before we were shown our table. A Waitress came over and took our orders and we chose the famous\" Parmegedon and the Roasted Pig Melt Grilled Cheese Sandwiches.. We got our food after another ridiculous wait time of 45 minutes.. we were super hungry and frustrated by then...  As I said before we love to explore new places.. and thought that the food will be worth the wait..   The sandwiches were really good . We would have enjoyed them better if they were not accompanied by long wait times which made this whole experience forgettable for us .We felt that this place was just hyped up and did not deserve all the attention it was getting. I don't think we want to go back to this place again...  Thats my opinion...  Yelpers have fun!!!"}
{"text":"The BEST sandwich spot I've been to. In town for business, and remembering Melt from Man vs Food, and had to stop in. GLAD I DID. Wait time was 20 minutes...on a Sunday night. Generally a good sign. There's SMALL bar area with limited seating while you wait, but good selection of beers including a good stout.  But the food here is just amazing. Every combination you'd create to go with grilled cheese...and matching humorous names. Large slices of bread, a stack of fries and coleslaw to go with it. I had a special of the month, a Thai Shrimp sandwich that was absolutely delicious. The favorite of my table was the Monte Cristo. The Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken was a close second. Large portions; you won't go hungry.  The menus are done on the back of 70s and 80s albums (I had an old Jackson 5 album cover), just to add a little more ambience.  Service was friendly and great for recommendations. Definte local spot, and perfect for tourists too. This is an absolute no-miss in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Honest to god, I must say that I'm not the kind of person to complain or even write a review for that matter, but after dining at the Melt in Mentor, I had to create a Yelp account and write a review. Here it goes, my first restaurant review, wish it could have been better.  Service? Great.  Food? Good. Drinks? Love the draft selection. Very Good. Management? The worst i've ever seen.   We had a large party of 15, celebrating our work cristmas event. Since they did not take reso's, we waited quite a while, about 2 hours on a Wednesday at 8pm. There were many who arrived after us and were seated before us, but we understood and were ok with waiting, even though the wait was much longer than it needed to be. Once seated, we realized the tables were set for 12, and had to call a server over to help us add seats. Since we were having a gift exchange, I asked a server if we could pull over one more table and put our gifts on it, he said Ok. While pulling the table over, the manager Kyle rushed over and asked what I was doing, keep in mind the place was half empty at this point, I explained that our server said it was ok to move this table, and Kyle replied \"It's a fire hazard, your server was wrong\", and walked away without even offering to help move the table back, which I did myself. Overall, by the end of the night our table spent over 600 dollars on food and drinks, NOT ONCE did Kyle even take the time to stop by and ask \"how was the food?, or 'thanks for waiting', or 'is everything ok', or 'thanks for coming', instead he spent all his time standing, with his arms crossed, behind an empty hostess table five feet from us, staring at a 3/4 empty restaurant. Just one server, pregnant as she was, took care of everyone, serving and bussing, and did the best job she could.   Melt, you do a great job. I've been to your place in Lakewood and Cleveland Heights multiple times and they've both been great. Too bad you're management hire at your Mentor location had to ruin the experience. I really felt insulted my intire visit, won't be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"This place was great, with an even mix of young folks, hipsters and familys out on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I had the 1/2  Kindergarten and soup fresh baked bread never tasted so good and you choose your favorite cheese then a cup of Tomato soup that had outstanding flavor and the salad rounded it out for a great meal over all for a price that was right. I will be back."}
{"text":"Good food. A little pricey for grilled sandwich in a bar.  If you get there before noon be prepared for a long wait as they make all the carry out call in orders before they start in the orders from walk ins sitting at a table who didn't order in advance. At 11:20 it took 30 min to get food.  We were the only ones in the place for most of that time and placed our order within a minute or two of arriving"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Melt on an early Thursday afternoon. The wait wasn't long. I expected a bit of texture from the Peanut Butter and Banana sandwich. Overall, it was bland in terms of the peanut butter and cream cheese, the bananas were mushy, and half of it had herb cream cheese on it. The mixed berry preserves were good and dipping made my sandwich taste like a jelly donut. The pop was pretty flat but the service was good. I will give it another shot with a different sandwich, I don't recommend the Peanut Butter and Banana one. My sister loved her Northcoast Shores sandwich. The fries were average."}
{"text":"Checked back in tonight because every restaurant in the area was packed for the world series. Melt was a ghost town.  The bartender (and I use that term loosely) spoke like he was in a huge rush to be somewhere else. \"Hey guys, need menus?\" And runs away. Rushed us through our order and when ever he asked us if we needed anything or how our food was it was as he was rushing buy, not even stopping for an answer.  Again, the place was empty so why such the rush? The best part: his pants were around his knees, we got to look at his underwear the whole meal!  The lack of professionalism shows just how little the management cares."}
{"text":"First off, I am a salad person. Everyone knows that when I go out to eat, I will most likely get a salad. (preferably a chicken Caesar salad.) Well, not at the Melt. This is the only restaurant that I won't get the same thing every time I go. I have tried a handful of their sandwiches, and I honestly don't know what my favorite is. It changes every single time I go. Their sandwiches are huge and filled with loads of flavor. Delicious! I have gone and waited two and a half hours before, but let me tell you, it's definitely worth the wait! My husband and I usually go when they open...(We try to avoid a wait!) They actually have three different locations...Lakewood, Cleveland Heights, and a new one is opening in Independence on October 7th. If you haven't tried Melt yet, I suggest you go and do it!!"}
{"text":"I don't rate service, ambiance, cleanliness and wait times; they are too variable. I can put up with anything if the food is good. It is all about the food- that's it. All of my ratings are based on vegan options only.   Notes: Saw this restaurant on TV. Been here twice. Always wishing for the day I end up in Cleveland to eat here again. The vegan options are great. I wish they would make more of them!"}
{"text":"The most overrated restaurant in town.  Gigantic bread filled with nothing but goo.  A heart attack on a plate!"}
{"text":"Spectacular meal!  My husband had the Firecracker Chicken Sandwich of the month - it was fantastic and had lots of kick.  My daughter ordered the PB&J, which was incredible.  Of course, she would have preferred Goldfish crackers, but my husband and I enjoyed her sandwich.  I loved the Bread, Bacon, and  Blue Salad with warm bacon vinaigrette.  Our son was giddy as he put away the Wake and Bacon sandwich.  Every minute on the treadmill was worth the indulgence tonight."}
{"text":"I really don't like this place. I remember moving back to Cleveland in 2011 and hearing from everyone and their mother that I needed to try Melt. Well, I tried it many times between 2011-2014. The sandwiches are gross. I absolutely loved their Melt House salad, but they changed it and took out all of the good ingredients. The kitchen also messed up our orders many times and would substitute ingredients on things without even asking us. Once my boyfriend even received bacon on what was supposed to be a vegetarian item. Unfortunately it was a to-go order so we just threw it out. It wasn't worth it to complain because we have no desire to go there anymore.  One time we were sat so close to the people next to us that I was too embarrassed to get up to use the restroom. If I wanted to stand up, I literally would have had to squeeze and scooch my butt across their table. They only hire hipsters here to preserve their image, which goes to show it really is all about the hype. Service was usually just okay, but always slow. I just didn't feel like a valued customer here-- ever."}
{"text":"I see that a lot of people were very turned off by the wait time for Melt.  To be honest, if I had to wait over an hour for a grilled cheese sandwich, I'd probably be a little miffed as well.  Fortunately, my girlfriend and I were visiting Cleveland for a few days and managed to swing by Melt in Cleveland Hts at about 2:30 pm on a Friday.  I guess it was the magic hour, because we waited for maybe 2 minutes before being seated and we we ordered, ate, and were out of there within about an hour.  I really liked Melt.  I thought the pop culture/ 80's icon decor was really fun and I thought that using old record sleeves for menus was very creative.  The servers and hosts all were very friendly as well.  The food was really good!  I ordered a special -- something with spicy barbecued pork.  Along with a side of fries and cole slaw.  All were great - especially the bread!  My dining companion ordered a mushroom melt, which I also think she enjoyed.  The portions were very good sized for a reasonable price.  In fact, I only ate about half of my sandwich - and the rest of my leftovers were promptly eaten by my relatives, which is a good sign (although most of my family is not that picky).  We were also able to order a vegan kindergartner (plain grilled cheese) for my brother to go - which I think he liked!  I was also impressed by the bar, which had a great selection of beers.  My girlfriend HATES beer, but they even had one that she enjoyed - Lindemann's Frambois.  Next time I am in Cleveland, I will definitely try to stop by Melt again."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese and beer.  Melt takes aim at the sweet spot of the Midwest and smacks it pretty darn well. The menu is upscale bar food -- appetizers and sandwiches (including some nice burgers) -- but with a wry sense of humor about Melt's Greater Cleveland location: witness a grilled cheese with a pierogie inside called the \"Parmageddon.\"  More-than-ample portions, great fries, crunchy slaw, and over 100 beers (including about a dozen on tap).  Expect a long wait, but servers are attentive once you finally get a table, despite the over-capacity crowd (on a weekday!)."}
{"text":"Living in Lakewood, I'm a little spoiled. Bad day at work? Stop by Melt for dinner. Good day at work? Order takeout from Melt for dinner. Bored? Melt. It's turned into a problem.  We have always found the service to be very friendly and the wait time for the sandwiches to be very consistent. I love the Backyard BBQ (beef brisket version), but I still miss the Winter Chicken sandwich that was removed from the menu when they simplified.  I usually only eat half of the sandwich, and I'll heat up the rest in the oven a day later.  Overall, I really like stopping in here, and I feel lucky to live within walking distance of this place."}
{"text":"Came in from California and would love to see one of these restaurants in California. The servings are HUGE so you might consider sharing.  One half of a sandwich is more than enough for a full meal.  The wife and I got a Monte Cristo and Big Popper, the Monte Cristo killed it. Definitely recommend sharing that sandwich for couples.    I would have loved to see half orders on the sandwiches, save a little money and a stomach ache.  Great atmosphere for younger crowds and interesting decor."}
{"text":"I have only had Melt once during my trip to Cleveland last year.  It was awesome. The Menu is on the back of record sleeves! There are tons of drinks to choose from. The food is great. I ate with five others and they raved about their meals as well. I had The Dude Abides (Veggie). It came out in a timely manner. The sandwich was huge! I had no idea. My wife had the New Bomb Turkey (veg) and loved it. Our server was great. She was nice and knew what she was talking about.  If you decide to go, get there early or prepare to wait in a long line. I think it is worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Cleveland! You have to try the Mighty Macaroni Melt w/ Bacon! Every sandwich on the menu is good, and the service has always been great too!"}
{"text":"I have been to Melt 3 or 4 times now, and I can't say I'm that impressed.  When I've had a grilled sandwich, they have been good, but not great.  The breakfast sandwich had undercooked bacon in it.  The non-sandwich food I have had has also been below average.  I had a salad so large that it was difficult to eat.  You can't put a giant pile of spinach on a flat plate and expect it not to land mostly on the floor.  What a pain in the a**.    The final straw for me was this past Thursday when I went in around 9.  The place was not very busy.  Bar was not full, yet no bartender came to get me a drink for at least 6 or 7 minutes.  Did not offer me a food menu even though I wanted to order something, so that was another 15 minutes before she came by again to even get a menu.  I ordered spinach and artichoke dip.  This is pretty much a no-brainer.  However, Melt's spinach dip comes with a bunch of scallions and shredded cheese on top of the cold tortilla chips.  Why?  It's not like any of the cheese is going to stay on the chip after you pick it up.  It's cold.  Their food lacks any kind of thought.    I am done with Melt, I don't care how much everyone else likes it.  I can make a grilled cheese with anything I want on it by going to the grocery store and cooking it myself, and it will certainly take less than the 45 minute wait that you typically have here.  Best of all, the service will be good, because it's me.  It only gets the second star because they have good beer."}
{"text":"I don't make it to Cleveland often, but when I do, I'll be back to Melt.  I went with my aunt, who said \"I'm NOT waiting 2 hours at dinner time for a grilled cheese sandwich, so let's go for lunch when the wait isn't so long,\" and I completely agreed. So we did.  Her Monte Cristo was perfect, and I had the August special with the falafel... it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. And there was way too much food on one plate to eat at one time... definitely easy to make 2 meals out of one.  And they have a great selection of mainstream and craft beers.  I loved the menus, both from a presentation standpoint (very original idea), and from a content standpoint - almost too many choices.  The employees were all very friendly.  If you're into the conservative scene with all of the employees wearing uniforms, this may not be your spot.  (It had a vibe similar to my current Phoenix favorite, Postino).  Needless to say, we decided that we'd definitely wait the two-hours at dinner time for the experience."}
{"text":"It's just a grilled cheese sandwich, not worth the hour plus wait to get in, and then the slow service once seated. Unfortunately Melt's seems to believe it's own hype."}
{"text":"The decor was fun, the food was tasty, but the service made it.  Josh, our server was lots of fun and had great beer recommendations for a table of non local beer enthusiasts.  The hostesses gave us directions to a fantastic nearby bottle shop so we could stock up weary souvenir brews, and while there I ran into another (off shift) Melt employee  picking up some drinks for his Superbowl party.  We chatted about what I'd tried at the restaurant and he made some suggestions from what was available in the shop.  Totally above and beyond great service!"}
{"text":"Family of four had a great time.  We had heard of this place for a long time but it was our first time.  I was grateful that our server really took the time to go through the menu and specials with us.  I asked for recommendations too.  I would never have ordered the \"Elvis\" in a million years, but she recommended it, explained how it was prepared with homemade peanut butter, caramelized bananas, etc.  We also ordered a pulled pork sandwich off of the specials list.  They were accommodating to picky eaters (my children) with suggestions and substitutions.  Because our server took the time to explain things I tried something other than the hamburger (which I am certain is very good).  Next time I go, I will probably split one sandwich order with my wife.  But it was fun to go.  I plan on going there with guys from work as a group since the atmosphere was very nice for an after work get together.  The bartender make very good drinks using quality booze, and their bar prices are cheaper than any other place in town.  We also liked the retro sodas they offered.  Orange Cream, etc."}
{"text":"Woweee those are some portions!!! Only come here if you have an APPETITE.  I was so surprised to see the option to veganize most of the sandwiches and sides!! Yay! So glad a popular grilled cheese restaurant is keeping up with the trends. The vegan cheese, however, was pretty gross. So, Melt's heart is in the right place, but they have some work to do."}
{"text":"I doubt I need to say it, but this place has a lot of hype. Because of that, there is one hell of a wait for this grilled cheese bar.  However, if you are patient (hour's wait, minimum), Melt will not disappoint. The beer selections is amazing. Dogfish head and Great Lakes for miles. Then there's the food. All the food is cooked to order(sushi grade tuna? Bananas!). The sandwiches are gigantic and crispy, the cheese overflowing, and no runny grease.  I don't live in Cleveland, I don't much care for the city, but Melt is all the reason I need to weather the Cleve. Go there, eat, and be merry."}
{"text":"This is the best Melt out of the four. The portions can be too much and the drinks get pricey, but I always really enjoy myself. You can't ask for a cooler kitsch place with awesome comfort food."}
{"text":"This place is worth the 1 hour or 2 hour wait that you will be given for wanting a table here. It's just too original and different and wonderful to pass up the chance to try this one out.   The sandwiches of course are the star here. I had the Westside Monte Cristo and it was a monsterous sandwich of goodness. Battered french toast like bread, gooey american and swiss cheese, smoked turkey and ham all accompanied by a side of berry preserves. The sandwich hits every sweet, salty, savory taste bud I have and it was quite awesome. There was a lot of bread, maybe too much, but still, awesome. My wife had the Mushroom Melt with vegan cheddar cheese. The sweet caramelized onions and garlic mushrooms went great with the cheese and toasted bread. My wife claimed it was the best cheese sandwich she has had in her life and that's significant.  She's a vegetarian and has had plenty of cheese sandwiches in her lifetime. The fries and slaw that come with every sandwich were sadly so-so and actually seemed like they were sitting on our plates in the window for sometime before being served to us. The fries were luke warm and the slaw was dry for the sauce had trickeld down to the bottom of the plate. But, really one should not come here for the sides so I forgive them. Another star attraction to this place was their drink selections. A lot of micro brewed beer to choose from but what got me excited was their selection of micro brewed soda pop and especially their choices of Jones Soda. Growing up in the Seattle area delicious Jones Soda is in abundence there but sadly in the midwest it's harder to obtain. It was a joyous moment to be able to order an ice cold Jones Soda Cream Soda and enjoy its almost cotton candy like creamy goodness. Throw in the fact that the atmosphere is fun with scattered holiday decorations on shelves, cool looking posters of their sandwich specials on walls, and friendly tattooed employees running about, and you got one restaurant that can't be missed. Just be ready to wait. But in the end it will all be worth it."}
{"text":"First thing to know about Melt is there is almost ALWAYS a wait. I went with two friends on a Saturday at 4:00PM and the wait was 30-40 minutes. My friends said they have arrived when it opens at 11:00AM and there is still a line waiting to get in. So, if you are in a hurry, go elsewhere. And, obviously, the smaller the group the easier to be seated. Tables are basically 4-square so larger groups can have a few pulled together. But waiting for some to open up near each other might take a while.  Next, the staff is very friendly. While standing at the hostess desk they saw I was wearing a \"Praise Cheeses\" T-shirt that they loved (I mean, their name IS Melt.). When seated, one of them even came by and leaned in to the waiter to say \"Check out his shirt!\" The waiter took the time to explain, as it was my first visit there, that I could have virtually anything I wanted and they would prepare it anyway I wanted.  The sandwiches are massive. I ordered their burger, a half pound of fresh beef, at $11.00. Prices, on the surface, seem high. I ordered my burger with blackened seasoning. For another buck I added grilled onions, and for another buck-and-a-half, avocado. That might seem high: $13.50 for a burger. But that included a huge amount of fries (some of which I had to take home). And when considering other high-end burger joints like B-Spot, The Rail or Flip Side, prices are actually right in line. I just hoped the food matched the price.  So how was it? The burger arrived already cut in half with a ton of fries and a pickle. No bun. Toasted, thick-cut bread held the burger. The waiter had explained they don't really use a grill, so the blackened seasoning wouldn't be seared into the meat. It came cooked medium-well, but still juicy. I took a bite and decided it was pretty good. Then I experienced something unusual: with every bite the burger tasted better and better. The seasoning became more noticeable.Toppings (avocado) were falling off, which I used my fork to finish, and the bread/bun held up enough that I could finish the entire. Yes. It went from a pretty good burger to a great burger, and all I had to do was keep eating it!"}
{"text":"Whenever I have family or friends visit me we go to Melt.  Their menu is expansive and every time I go I try to order something I've never had before (which is actually pretty easy to do, since they have so many choices!)  The best part is that its surprisingly very vegetarian friendly because in many of the sandwiches you can substitute a tofu or soy product.  My favorite thing to get is their wet hot buffalo chicken grilled cheese. The fake chicken they use in the sandwich is the best I have ever had and tastes most similar to the real thing. Not only that but the combination of flavors is incredible!   Also, even though the sandwiches cost more than usual, it feeds you for two meals. I always take half my sandwich, fries, and slaw home (since they give you so much) and eat that the next day. It actually reheats fairly well too. But the main point is you won't go home hungry and there will be plenty of yummy leftovers!"}
{"text":"If you like cheese, you'll like this place. If you like beer, you'll like this place. The beer prices are reasonable and they have an enormous selection. The variety of sandwiches are the stuff of legend. I'd also suggest getting here early, as our wait for 2 hours on a Sunday night.   Also, split a sandwich with someone you like, unless you want to die of a heart attack. Seriously. They're huge and come with delicious fries."}
{"text":"Just incredible.  I had the Parmageddon which includes pierogies!  Locally made, at that.  Customized it by asking for carmelized onions and a side of house made BBQ sauce.  The slaw served on the side was delicious scooped up with bites of sandwich.  It also comes with fries which I requested Ultimate style, meaning topped with vegetarian chili, sautéed peppers & onions, etc.  Highly recommend!  And, super great for me, Melt can adjust almost anything for vegetarians or vegans.  Thank you!!! The menu will please anyone and the portions are even bigger than the menu.  Really wanted the house made bread pudding for dessert but just couldn't stuff myself any more.   Staff is wonderful.  They really know the food.  And they don't rush you. LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"We found out about this place and have been wanting to go for months! Finally got our chance and can't wait to go back. The place is kitschy as soon as you walk in. There was a Centipede arcade game as soon as you walk in. The hostess station has a display case with t-shirts and a Gene Simmons doll greeting you. Above the bar are vintage holiday blow mold lights. The menus are on the back of old albums. The only thing that could be a little better are the albums we had I didn't recognize and I looked over and saw someone else's-didn't recognize that either. They probably didn't want to desecrate any Led Zeppelin or Beatles albums. I understand. The drink and add on menu was covered in denim and studs. Awesome. We didn't know what to order-my bf didn't want to alter any sandwiches by adding anything on the first time. He wanted to try their hangover fries and I wanted to try the apple crisp bread pudding a table next to us got. Looked AMAZING! Since he was drinking and I wanted dessert we decided to split a sandwich and finally decided on the  Big Popper. When it came, my eyes bugged out! 3 Huge pieces of deep fried goodness with preserves. Sandwich was awesome! but we were so full we couldn't eat anything else. Loved it so much that we went back 2 days later and tried something else. We can't wait to go back and try yet another creation. The table next to us was very friendly. The guy at the table had the Dude Abides meatball sandwich and it looked AMAZING. Totally love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We only had to wait 45 minutes for a table. I was told that is good for Melt standards. Our server was really slow and she only had 2 of the maybe 12 tables in the restaurant. Ordered a Sprite to drink...it was moderate...Food was pretty good and the atmosphere is cool. Overall, I would go here maybe on an annual basis."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and excellent carb bomb inspired grilled cheese creations. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Decent restaurant though I do not understand the hype. The sandwiches are large and flavorful though I am not a fan of the Texas toast.   The decor is purposely kitschy but my biggest gripe is the waits that we have encountered here on the few times we have been. I don't really understand why people would choose to wait 30-45 minutes for bar food when so many better local options are available."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches. My wife really enjoyed them too. Definitely a must to try. You may want to split a meal with someone. You can also make our own creations. Stop by if you are in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Perhaps a dozen visits since they opened the location at Cedar and Taylor.   Never had a sandwich there that wasn't excellent. Never had a bowl of soup there that wasn't subpar. Service is meh, but I feel it's the volume rather than the servers themselves.   Overall, highly recommended.   But stay away from the soup. I beg you."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I was very disappointed, and perhaps this will save someone else from wasting their time and money. After reading many mixed reviews from other melt locations I decided to give it a try. I am not usually too concerned with decor as long as the place is clean, but all of the random mixed decor just made the place look cheap and poorly done in my opinion. Having a kids menu also would have been a plus.  Many people raved about the pierogies on reviews that I read, so we made sure to order them. You get 2 for $5 and although they are a decent size they were certainly nothing special. In fact, the ones you can buy in the freezer section are much better. The coleslaw didn't look appetizing at all, so I didn't even bother to try it. The fries were fries, once again nothing special. I had already narrowed my sandwich choices down from the rants and raves of others and I ended up ordering the big popper. I was not very impressed. It took everything I had to force down half a sandwich. I certainly wouldn't call it gourmet grilled cheese...not so great overpriced greasy slop perhaps.  I've had better tasting and higher quality meals from fast food places.  Save yourself the disappointment, but if you must go to see for yourself just remember, I told ya so :)"}
{"text":"We were passing through on a road trip to Minnesota and found this great bar and grill! There are a bunch of beers on tap! This place brings a whole new meaning to grilled cheese!!   I had the potato bacon bomb, amazing!! This sandwich tastes like a loaded potato skin but 10 times better!! Their French fries are to die for.....get a side of ranch for dunking!!   The service was great and very friendly! The atmosphere is hipster and fun!!"}
{"text":"Whatever it is, have no fear, It CAN be deep fried.  Whole sandwiches in fact, stuffed with cheese, jalapenos, jam, meat, you name it, make the plunge, into the vat of boiling oil.  Don't misunderstand - my deep friend spicy blackeyed pea greens and cheese sandwich was really tasty !  Just make sure you wash it down with beer!  There is a rather fabulous selection to choose from.  Random thought - note to Melt - have you considered biofuels?  Shame to waste all of that fryer oil."}
{"text":"Melt is Heaven with a line.  Sure, 2 and even 3 hours waits are a bit nuts, but that's the way it is. I only ever go when I'm willing to make an evening of it: spend those hours hitting the bar relentlessly counting on the overload of carbs to sober me up before the ride home.  The bar is extensive enough to make this not only feasible, but a pleasure.   Usually sneaking in between lunch and 5PM on a week day works well, if you're not committed to making a night of it.  The food itself is exquisite. I always seem to go for the Big Popper, but I've yet to pick a sandwich I've regretted. Especially amazing was the December Special: Mac n' Cheese grilled cheese.  The only negative is when you wait over an hour to be seated, only for them to run out of bread on you. Admittedly, we were warned of the possibility, and stuck it out anyway.  When people come to see me, I always take them here. One of the best spots in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is the ultimate comfort food showdown. It's decor is unique and gives a very loved atmosphere. The food is amazing though. The menu is full of unique grill cheese sandwiches all of which are fantastic in your mouth. The Monty cristo is one of my personal favorites but every sandwich is tasty.  One of my favorite locations in Cleveland to eat."}
{"text":"I just recently moved to Lakewood and had to eat at Melt before another person asked me if I had eaten there.   Overall Melt lives up to the hype.  My expectations were met by great food, service and ambiance -- quality food, tentative friendly servers and funky décor.  The minimum wait is about an hour and a half.  If you are looking for instant gratification don't go to Melt.  If you want to hangout with your people and sample a couple of craft ales at the bar before you are seated head over to Melt."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place for lunch while visiting Cleveland for the weekend.. Hands down best sandwich joint I've ever been too! The service was awesome the portions  are huge and the atmosphere is very chill and friendly! Would highly recommend coming here especially if you are an out of stater!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour, perfectly fine because we were waiting to dine at a four star yelp restaurant. Upon sitting down and ordering, waited 45 minutes for food. Cold food, cheese was \"melted\" way before we got our table. Staff not friendly. Don't waste time. Beer was good."}
{"text":"Huge huge portion, and really delicious food. We ordered War Pig and Big Popper, and each is amazing. We love War Pig more though. Peaaaaaaaaach cocktail is great too!"}
{"text":"Loooove Melt! The food's always fantastic (in an amazingly gluttonous way). I usually swap out fries for a salad. Good luck to ya if you want to sit at a table or have more than 2-3 people. The place is tiny but the bar seats alternate fairly quickly. You park across the street by the dollar store but there's always plenty of it. Love it."}
{"text":"The idea of a bar that serves nothing but grilled cheese sandwiches doesn't sound that appealing, but wait till you get there.    Cheese sandwiches dripping in cheese and other fab ingredients, a huge menu on vinyl album covers, and a very very well-stocked bar means a fab night is definitely on the cards here.    Just don't expect to find a low-fat option."}
{"text":"I assumed a place in Cleveland should at least be able to make a grilled cheese sandwich.   It seemed like the sort of food that should be simple enough and fit in with the Midwestern traditions.   I was very wrong.  We got the Hot Italian and the Kindergarten with chedder/provolone and bacon.   Both sandwiches were soggy and there was no hint they were ever crispy.   Certainly not at all toasted.   And honestly, for a place called melt there was very little cheese.  The fries were fine and the slaw was okay.  The service was responsive, they had a good selection of beers on tap and bottled sodas.   The interior was nostalgia kitsch with many local Cleveland references and pictures.  But the food was just not good.   For a place that specializes in grilled cheese sandwiches, they need to learn to make one.   Next time I am in town I'll go to Tommy's, the B Spot or Yours Truly."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff food is really good. My fave is the big popper yumm. Also love you can order to go but it can get a bit gooey if u live far away."}
{"text":"Melt is a cool place to stop in CLE. They have all types of interesting grilled cheese sandwiches. You can't fail with any of their combinations.   I stooped in had a grilled cheese and a few beers while watching a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game at the bar. I'll be back.   4 stars- love cheese- not healthy"}
{"text":"I have been there twice with my family. Everytime I go I am completely satisfied with my meal, and the atmosphere is always incredible. The only downside is the l long drive to Melts from where I live."}
{"text":"Man, I wish this place used to be the same way it was 2 years ago. The food has gone extremely downhill, it seems all pre-made and greasy. The wait on a Friday night can be up to 3 hours and I think that's INSANE for a grilled cheese sandwich you could make at home. Now, don't get me wrong the staff here is phenomenal! I just wish the food was prepared with love the way it used to be when you could just walk in and get a table."}
{"text":"I would rank the Independence Melt #2 out of the 3 Melt restaurants.  The wait time is much less than the Lakewood and Cleveland Hts locations.  The sandwiches are awesome.  Ask the waiter to replace the fries with their vegetable of the week - so tasty!"}
{"text":"I really like Melt.  I am not originally from this area so finding it was a very pleasant surprise.  I love the upbeat, spunky atmosphere and the menus on the back of the record covers.  The food at Melt has been hit or miss for me.  It's good, but not AMAZINGLY good, you know?  The peanut butter and banana has been my favorite so far.  It really was superb and tasty.  I will probably get it again.  My least favorite was the buffalo chicken sandwich (they had it for a limited time a few months ago) because it was suuuuper spicy and I felt sick after I ate it.  I actually gave the other half away to a friend (because I figured I just had a weak stomach that couldn't handle the spice or something... and he really liked spicy stuff) and he actually got sick the next day when he ate it!  The wait is really nuts.  And maybe it's me, but when I went to the Melt in Lakewood it felt like it closed pretty early for a Saturday night -- for a bar.  So for me, it's kind of a toss up, but I have thoroughly enjoyed some of the sandwiches and I know I'll continue to go back to work my way down the menu.  It really is somewhat of a Cleveland icon, at least restaurant-speaking.  So if you're on the fence, I would say go for it as long as you don't mind the wait.  It is quite a fun dining experience.  [I'm giving it a 3 instead of a 4 because of getting sick from that one sandwich.  I can't, in good conscience, give a 4 to a restaurant that has made me sick.  Plus, the wait is pretty bad.]"}
{"text":"So many melt choices! Love the fun kitchy atmosphere, huge portions, and delicious food."}
{"text":"So good! The mighty macaroni is delicious, so is the chorizo and potato! You may have to wait a little bit but food is well worth the wait. Staff is also very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"i have ordered from here 5 times. each time a different sandwich. greasy soaked texas style toast and bland as ever. they could have put anything on it to be honest, it tasted like hot grease. perfect for those who like indigestion and stomach pain. over-hyped restaurant, not worth the visit."}
{"text":"Had whatever the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is called.  It had about 1 tablespoon of peanut butter and about the same amount of jelly, all in the middle of the sandwich.  Fries were ok.  My wife ordered a spinach salad.  It was spinach thrown in a bowl!    I'm not a beer drinker so it really doesn't matter if there are one or three hundred.    Can get a much better sandwich at Mr. Brisket across the street.    The Cleveland mural on the wall was the best part."}
{"text":"The special of the day was the Ruben sandwich.  Having had terrible experiences with this sandwich in the past due to the meat falling out when bitten, I was hesitant to go for this dish.  However, I'm glad that I had the Ruben as the Melt Bar's version was so juicy and tender, the sandwich melted in my mouth.  Coming in a generous portion and with a even more generous side of fries, the ambiance at the bar and the conversation with the Cavs fan grabbing a bite before the game and the mothers getting ready to marry off their children was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"You will wait. You will wait for what seems like eons. It will be worth it.   EPIC CHEESY GOODNESS"}
{"text":"I know it's grilled cheese, but it is excellent! The Big Popper is my one and only. When are you going to open an establishment in Cincy? Perhaps, Downtown Cincinnati or near UC...just a recommendation..."}
{"text":"I've wanted to check out The Melt in Cleveland Heights for some time now but had never made it over there. I'm not sure if I need to get out more or what, but apparently there is a location in Independence, which is much closer to my home. Awesome! My hubby and I spent a portion of St. Patty's day at the Independence location. Awesome! The crowd was you guessed it...awesome and so was the food. I had the Monte Cristo which was actually only okay, but the rueben melt that my hubby had was AWESOME! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"While waiting for our meals to arrive, a guy seated at the table next to us told my friend and I that his meal was so good he \"wanted to cry.\" When our food was served shortly after we couldn't help but agree. Large portions and endless options for creating traditional and exotic grilled cheeses. My friend and I loved our meals so much that we ate until we were way past full. She got cheese fries with vegetarian chili, I had a grilled cheese with portobellas, avocado, grilled onions, and roasted red peppers. Sandwiches come with a mountain of fries, and are some of the best I've ever had. Atmosphere is fun and funky, cocktails are delicious, and food a must for any cheese lover like me!"}
{"text":"Only try \"Melt\" when you are really hungry, hungover, or just in need of a TON of food! I've tried the Gyro sandwich, and my fiance had the Buffalo chicken sandwich. Both were satisfying, however we felt like we ate a couple of bricks afterward (and we only ate half of our sandwiches!). I woke up the next day with a rough sodium hangover, and my fiance got a migraine headache from all of the salt. Lesson learned: next time, try the salad... I commend the place for homemade dressings and condiments, these go a long way on the fries and sandwiches. But, in my opinion, you can sometimes have too much cheese...  I'd also recommend sharing a sandwich, as they are humongous!"}
{"text":"You ever hear a song on the radio that you really like and you know it's going to be a hit and tell all your friends about it and after like 2 years it's on the radio all the time and you freaking hate it cause it's all you hear, but you still tolerate it because you know it's real catchy and well composed? yeah... that's melt. 1.5 hours waits on a monday at 2 in the afternoon, realizing you've spent over $1250 in food and beer (not including tips) because you're on your 5th $20 gift certificate for being in the big cheese club. knowing what special is coming up because you already own all the posters.   i hate melt, but i cant stop loving it...it's a true guilty pleasure; and it's probably going to kill me"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a grilled cheese person and I would have loved to see more cheese-free items on the menu, but I ordered a half Parmageddon and French fries and it was a decent lunch! The service was a little slow and they're fairly busy most of the time, though."}
{"text":"My first visit for lunch, and i really enjoyed the friendly service, attentive bartender (ate at the bar).  Plenty of TVs, good selection of beer and the food was very good!  Home backed bread scored points in my book, too. I liked the decor, the music and the vibe. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I love the way people complain about the wait. With a beer list like Melt's you need to calm your ass down have couple pints and share some laughs with your friends. This isn't Burger King.  The food's top notch and affordable. The Texas toast they use for the sandwiches can be a little hard to eat because they end up being so tall. My favorite is the El Diablo. I love this place."}
{"text":"Melt in numbers:  5: people in our party (me, the Mister, mom, dad, bro) 90: minutes we were told the wait was 3: times we fed the parking meeter 6: times I nagged my mom to ask how much time was left before we got to sit down 1: times she actually asked 115: minutes we actually waited 3: times the Christmas Story played (the run it on a loop in the TVs) 20: plastic lawn ornaments I counted (before I lost track) 24: Grilled cheese sandwiches to choose from 12:  times my stomach growled 3: Sandwiches really I wanted 60: minutes we waited for our sandwiches 3: times I tried to convince my family it'd be worth it 8: iced tea refills 5: happy tummies  Was it worth it? For me, yes. While the wait was really annoying, it gave me time to catch up with my family and spend quality time together with minimal distractions (other than my growling stomach). The food was, as expected, delicious.  I ordered the Grilled Peanut Butter, Banana and Cream Cheese Sandwich.  Dear Melt, next time, don't skimp on the peanut butter, OK? After waiting for a few hours, I think I deserve more than a tablespoon. Otherwise, delish.  The Mister ordered the West Side Monte Cristo, which included honey ham, smoked turkey, swiss, american, beer battered and mixed berry preserves  He compared it to an orgasm. I had a bite and tend to agree. TMI? It's OK we're all friends.  My brother ordered The Big Popper, which had fresh jalapeno peppers, cheddar & herbed cream cheese, beer battered and mixed berry preserves.  I can't remember what my dad ordered. And I didn't dare get within his personal space to investigate -- I know better than to mess with a hungry man    My mom was a whimp and ordered a salad. Don't bother, I already made fun of her."}
{"text":"Went to Melt in Lakewood for the second time Friday night after having a few Christmas Ales in Ohio City. I was just planning to go home and make some ramen but decided to stop in here instead. After it was all said and done, I actually would have preferred the ramen (I make ramen different than most).  Most people I've ever talked to about Melt say that it's crazy-busy and always have slow service. I've never had to wait for a seat and always had decent service but I sat at the bar which makes it easier to get attention.   As I mentioned, I've been here now twice. Each time the soups I've had were good. This time around it was buffalo chicken soup. Could have been spicier but overall it was good.   My first melt was the mac & cheese melt and Friday I had the felafel melt. The mac & cheese was a big fried puck of macaroni with very little cheesiness to it. This sandwich could be so much better if the mac & cheese was not so heavily breaded, or not fried at all. When I read the description, I had in mind more of a sandwich made with mac & cheese, which to me still sounds really good. Instead, it was a hockey puck of macaroni on a cheese sandwich.   The felafel melt was kinda disjointed, that's about the best way to describe it. It didn't seem like there was much of any cheese on the sandwich itself and the 3 pieces of felafel were an afterthought. I took the felafel out of the sandwich since it just didn't seem like it should be part of the sandwich. It wasn't the best felafel I've ever had either. Also, the sandwich on its own, without the giant pieces of felafel, wasn't that good.    A lot of people like this place but to me, it's a little overrated. If I go back, I'm going to order just a plain grilled cheese and soup and see where that gets me."}
{"text":"OMG!  This place puts Cleveland on the MUST visit map.  We went to Ohio to visit my father in law back in July and had the opportunity to stop by.  We went on a Monday at around 2PM expecting this to be the optimal (read 'No Wait') time to go . . . ALAS there was a 1+ hour wait.  We settled into the waiting area and had some drinks (great beer selection) and eventually we were seated.  It would have been worth TWICE the wait.  The food is truly FANTASTIC.  The grownups (4 of us) selected 5 different sandwiches which we proceeded to cut into 4 sections and tried each of them.  My hands down favorite:  'The Parmageddon' -AWESOME- do not the weirdness of starch on starch dissuade you from this work of culinary art.  My wife's favorite (also a big foodie) was the \"Wake and Bacon' (she did not even let me have my piece -I'll have to try it next time).  The 'Big Popper' and the 'Tokyo Tuna Melt' were my runners up.  I truly am looking forward to our next trip to Ohio because of this place."}
{"text":"First visit a bit load for some. Beer and sandwich selection awesome! Caught a look at the portion size waiting for my meal, come hungry or it's definitely a doggie bag to go. Heard about this place while in Minnesota,  when I found one in Cleveland  had to try it. Ordered fried green tomatoes BLT wasn't and a double IPA. Great meal and lunch for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed - I expected more after all of the hype.  Food was good, not great and the combinations of food offered are interesting, but it's grilled cheese and fries.  Service was good, location was not."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed - I expected more after all of the hype.  Food was good, not great and the combinations of food offered are interesting, but it's grilled cheese and fries."}
{"text":"I know I'm jumping on the bandwagon here...but this place is awesome.  I recently checked out the new location in Cleveland Heights and had an awesome time and an incredible meal.  I was prepared for a long wait and was quoted 45 minutes by the hostess, but quickly found a seat at the bar, ordered a delicious drink, and was given a table just a short 10 minutes later!  The service was fun and attentive and it was hilarious watching some of the sandwich creations that came out of the kitchen.  I personally ordered the monthly special (some sort of delicious roast beef/horseradish/potato monstrosity) and have been craving it ever since -- hopefully they serve it again!  Go check out Melt with an open mind and some patience, and you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Visiting from the south, my plan was simple.  Go for the grilled cheese and jazz it up with toppings because Diane + cheese=happy girl.  Then I noticed the new bomb turkey on the menu.  I love thanksgiving so I knew the plan was over at that point. I ordered this thanksgiving on the bun sandwich and my husband got the war pig.  Our third compadre got the philly cheesesteak sandwich.  These sandwiches arrived and let me tell you...huge doesn't adequately describe them.  They are some of the biggest sammys I have seen and they come with sides.  My sandwich was awesomeness of thanksgiving dinner, my husbands was a cuban sandwich that he really enjoyed (mind you, we are from Florida..so he knows cuban sandiwiches).  The cheesesteak was good as well, but not cheesy enough for me.  My husband and I couldn't finish the sides or even the whole sandwiches, our companion championed through.  Melt..I loveth thee...expand to Florida please...I already have my Melt army tshirt ready."}
{"text":"Alright, this isn't a change to my rating so much as its a comment about one thing i've noticed after being a repeat guest many, many times - why are the front of house people SO unwelcoming every time? I don't get it. I have never been rude, weird, or annoyed with them and every time I walk in and either put my name in or wait for a table, someone acts like a jerk. Give me a break ! I am here to eat delicious sandwiches, drink great beers, and spend $$ ! ACT NICE !  This is not, however, a comment on the servers or bartenders because they have consistently been awesome and helpful.   Had the Soul Vegetarian this time - pretty crazy, and I love collards so I couldn't resist - but the cornbread in the sandwich just kind of.. ruined it. Oh well. Back to the regular menu next time definitely.   No wait today which I found baffling. And no booze for me either, shockingly enough. To the dude who was shocked by a $7 hitachino - that stuff is $5 & up in the bottle so I would not be deterred by that at all. There are plenty of reasonably priced draft and bottle bevs all over that menu."}
{"text":"I stopped here on my way to Columbus from Buffalo to visit my brother and watch the Sabres take on the Blue Jackets. This place is pretty good if your hungry or if you love leftovers. My favorite thing about this place other than the food are the posters that they design for their special melts. They change up the menu and have unique melts and I wish we had one in Buffalo."}
{"text":"Not only the best Grilled Cheese I've ever had, but maybe the best sandwich ever.   Because I'm a loser, I traveled from Long Island to here just for this after seeing the place on Man V. Food. I was tempted to try the Melt Challenge, but opted for another sandwich since I wanted to add stuff to the bread and cheese. After waiting for an hour and a half, we finally got a table and I was STARVING since I had a very small lunch to prep for this.  I got the smoked russian which was turkey, gouda, sauer kraut and russian dressing. The sandwich was fantastic. The bread made the sandwich awesome (you can tell it was homemade). Well worth the wait and trip."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere, just two words, \"ACOUSTIC FOAM\"!!!!  A few acoustic foam panels in the ceiling would dampen the overbearing noise from the metal ceiling.  Otherwise wonderful dining, just noisey.  Detroit Ave location never seemed that noisey.  Had the Smokey Russian and absolutely delicious.  Will def go back, maybe not a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"this joint is on point. killer sammies and brews to boot! great spot to meet up w/ friends. be prepared to wait, they can get super busy."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place and I was expecting a great meal, I was very disappointed. To start, it took 45 minutes to get a table and another 45 minutes to receive the food. That's an hour and a half on a WEDNESDAY night. I ordered the Parma Italy and, maybe it was just my selection, but every bite was agonizingly terrible. The chicken was fairly burnt and there was some unrecognizable ingredient that wasn't even possible to chew. I ate about a quarter of the sandwich hoping it would get better...it never did. The rest of my family seemed to enjoy their sandwiches, so maybe it was my selection.   For dessert, we ordered the Wookie's Revenge which is a chocolate cake mixed with bacon and topped by ice cream and more bacon flakes. The cake itself was practically cold when it reached our table, and the bacon was so overdone I felt like I was eating chips of wood. Don't get distracted by the hype and the popularity, this place is not worth the wait. You can probably get just as good if not better food in less than 20 minutes somewhere else in the area."}
{"text":"Portions are insane.  Food is really good - basically a foodie enhanced version of grilled cheese.  On steroids.  With an egg on top.  Can't go wrong.  Be prepared, though, for carbs and calories.  And a lot of flavor.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"Their Tokyo Tuna Melt took me on an emotional journey and has remained in my heart ever since. There is probably not anything more that I can say about this place that other people have not, but Melt does grilled cheese better than any other gourmet grilled cheese place I have ever been to.  Regardless of the fact that I have not been to an other gourmet grilled cheese place; Melt is special and is a 'must try' for the East Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Yum, yum!!  I have been wanting to try this place for years, but since I live in Florida, and my trips up here are usually short, I haven't had time in the past. I was up for a week recently so I finally had the chance to try this out and all I can say is Yum!  I had the potato bomb, which tasted like a giant potato skin. So good! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not just a sandwich girl. I don't know. I visited Melt on a Saturday night and unsurprisingly, it was packed. We waited for a little over an hour and finally got to eat. The sandwich I devoured wasn't that bad but alas, \"Hunger is the best cook.\" Not bad, I mean, I think it's a little overhyped but the food was okay."}
{"text":"Walking into this place is like the atmosphere of a Chuck E. Cheese on acid, with a truckload of attitude.    While we were visiting, Melt came up as a lunch option.  Our host wasn't sure if there was a liquor license yet, so I called ahead to check.  The very salty hostess told me \"Uh, the word bar is in the name\"  Why yes you're right, so sorry for bugging you, you snot.  But while she was so busy being the aforementioned snot, she neglected to tell me of the 1 hour 45 minute wait.  So after driving to the lovely (sarcasm) strip mall  that this place is located we find a room filled with screaming kids and bored looking adults.  Thanks for the great customer service.  I'll be sure to mention my experience to anyone that will listen.    I'm starting to think that appearing on the Food Network is like being on the cover of Sports Illustrated, or the Madden Football game.  It's a curse."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and it was ready in a half hour. I would definitely recommend ordering take out than waiting because I've heard terrible things about how long the wait is. The food was so good. I got the Winter Chicken. It was so filling and heavy but I didn't care and I ate it all. (Bad decision in the long run for my stomach, but in the moment it was one of the best things I have ever eaten) The service I had at the front desk was great. The French fries were great and finished those off too. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"They added a vegan and gluten free menu with many choices. The noodle salad #1 was full of fresh spinach and herbs.  They are cool to customize your meal since it is made fresh so I removed peanuts and half the dressing from my salad and it still tasted great.  My husband loved their burger and fries. They are promoting a new veggie burger that supposed to be amazing. Will try it next time I'm in.  Service staff attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I never visit Cleveland without a trip to Melt. There's probably a sandwich for everyone, and the beer selection is top notch.   The kitchen can make meatless versions of many of their classic sandwiches. The purple parma, big popper, and mushroom melt sandwiches are unstoppable, but be warned that the portions are big! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat here in Cleveland. Great beer, good atmosphere, AMAZING food. Smokey Russian and Monte Cristo are my favorites. I've eaten all over the world and this is seriously one of my all time favorite places EVER."}
{"text":"This place is great.  the menu has plenty of great sandwiches to choose from, but after trying it, if you like it, you really need to get the emails so you can see what the sandwich of the month is(it's usually worth trying!). Also, the coleslaw is pretty good.  It's the only that I'll eat, no mayo and has a bit of a kick too it. Sometimes it can get a little crowded and the wait can be long-ish, but worth it to get a Melt fix."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try Melt after everything we had heard and seen. We anticipated a wait and were told an hour to an hour and fifteen minute wait. So we took a walk around and came back 45 minutes later  to be rudely told our name had already been called. Luckily the girl who had told us how long the wait would be was still there and she got us a table. Our waitress was friendly but very flustered. There is not a kids menu, so our children split the plain grilled cheeses however they don't like fries or coleslaw. It took 40 minutes from when we ordered till we got our food, and when we did get it it was luke warm and the sandwiches were soggy like they had been sitting. My husband and I had ordered the house beer and it took our waitress 10 minutes to tell us they were out of it, we also ordered a second milk for our son and never received it but were charged for it. My husband and I may give it a second try but definitely not with the kids."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst experience of my life at a restaurant cuz of the slow service and they messed up my meal and didn't make me another one or comp it so I had to eat sushi and I hate sushi. AND WHAT KIND OF PERSON WANTS SUSHI IN THEIR GRILLED CHEESE!!!! MY GOD"}
{"text":"I've been hearing so much about this place that I finally had to try it. I've tried to go twice but it was an extremely long wait so we left. No big deal, you know there's gonna be a wait. So I did a carryout this time, which was perfect. The woman on the phone was very friendly as was the woman who completed my order once I got there.  We got the Parmageddon and the Wake and Bacon. I had about a 20 minute ride home and when I got in the food was still warm.   So here's my take, it's good but it's nothing special. Take 2 slices of italian bread, put some butter on it. Get some cheese from the West Side Market and put whatever you'd like in between, eggs & bacon, pierogies, whatever. I think it's more of a novelty thing.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good but I don't think it was anything out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, great sandwiches, and great place, get ready to wait 90 min plus, at just about any time though. Full service at the bar, pound for pound, their soups are better than their sandwiches too. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Worst hamburger I have had. On toast. Fake butter flavor on it. Had the applitizer. So much salt on it. Tried scraping salt off. Still way to much."}
{"text":"I live in Philly, a city known for its famous melted cheese sandwiches (cheesesteaks).  But until I ate I Melt, I never knew what a sandwich could be.  Since October, when I visited Cleveland, the delicious chorizo sandwich I ate at Melt has haunted my dreams.  When I see the Big Cheese Club card in my wallet, I yearn for a giant tower of meltiness, meat and bread.  When Melt posts on Faceboook with their new sandwich of the month, I remember that I really do need to book a ticket to Cleveland again sometime soon.  Both the food and atmosphere are fun and excellent.  The menu is a long list of grilled cheese sandwiches cooked in a zillion different ways, many with funny names like \"The Kindergarten\" (plain) and \"Parmageddon.\"  Every month a special is offered--like a Chinese cuisine-inspired melt sandwich or grilled cheese involving Hungarian paprikash.  Also, if you get tattooed with the Melt logo, you get 20% off at Melt for life!  And service is super-friendly.  Regarding the wait that everyone is complaining about: When I ate at Melt, we arrived at the very start of the lunch hour on a weekday and were seated immediately.  We went back twice, the wait was a a bit too long each time (about an hour), so we left and ate dinner somewhere else.  The point is, Melt warns you about the wait, and from there it is your decision to stand around getting hungry and grouchy.  Don't blame the restaurant for being popular!    Clevelanders, be grateful that you have Melt (and soon, TWO Melts)!  I sincerely wish a restaurant like this would open in my city."}
{"text":"Looking for a place in the area to hang out and grab some great food with your friends on a weekend? Melt's the place for you. This is a definite spot you want to check out if you're ever in the Cleveland-area.   The portions are massive - which means there's plenty leftover for lunch, dinner, or a midnight snack. The menu offers a unique variety of grilled cheese spinoffs - perfect to satisfy any craving you're having that day  My favorites include the Dude Abides, the BBQ Chicken, and the Wake and Bacon.   The overall decor is quirky and cool, probably more aimed at the younger adult generation.   All in all, Melt's a stellar spot and one of the reasons why dining in Cleveland just rocks."}
{"text":"Was in here last saturday with my girlfriend after tile shopping a few doors down. Her 2nd time but my first and let me tell you the food is amazing, I got the \"Dude Abides\" lots of cheese and homemade meatballs... OMG amazing. I could only eat half the sandwhich and the other was breakfast the next day. We sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome really nice guy gave us his opinion on what to order and was there just the right amount of time, enough to keep your drinks full, but not there every 2 seconds either. My impression of Melt is super clean, great food, inexpensive for the qty and quality you receive, great staff and I will definitely be back cant believe I have waited thjs long to try. 10 stars from me!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. In from out of town, and so in true gluttony (no, we didn't finish it all, and didn't even try), we ordered the Monte Cristo, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, and Dude Abides.  The Monte Cristo was fantastic. A little greasy, with oozy cheese, and a delightful raspberry jam. It will probably be the best Monte Cristo you'll ever have. Nothing wrong with a deep fried deli sandwich dusted with sugar!  The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was the sleeper hit. We figured it would just be a nice counterpoint to the evening, and it truly was. the slaw on top was fresh, zesty and just made the sandwich. Unfortunately, we're both not huge blue cheese fans, so we should have tried to substitute the cheese. Once we hit the heavy blue cheese in the sandwich, we lost momentum and had to abandon the effort.  The Dude Abides is a meatball and mozzarella sticks on a garlic bready bread, with marinara sauce. It was good, and certainly gluttonous, but its flavors didn't really hit a high note at any point. It was tasty, but heavy, and probably not what I'd choose for a whole sandwich unless I had a lot more marinara to dip it in.   The fries with the sandwiches are terrific and offer a nice break from the grilled cheese monotony.   I'm eager to return to try some of the other seemingly delicious combos."}
{"text":"I have only been to Melt twice and I loved the food. When I heard there was a location in Mentor I was so happy. No longer do I have to deal with lots of traffic in order to eat at the Cleveland Heights location and the huge wait. The Mentor location is much larger and airier than the Cleveland Heights location and has a large outdoor patio. The waitress was nice and I did not wait long to receive my meal.  I ordered the Parmageddon, which has a potato pierogi (big enough to fit across the entire sandwich) topped with sauerkraut and onions, and as always a huge side of fries. The first bite was so good that I had devour it instead of taking my good old time. You get the taste of the sauerkraut first, then comes the part of the sandwich that made you order it, the pierogi. Whenever you need a break from the sandwich, just dip the fries in ketchup and enjoy.  All in all, I will definitely come to this location in the future."}
{"text":"First,  I'd like to give a shout-out to my man, Dan at Melt for being an awesome server/guy and dealing with our rowdy group.   The food was awesome (tastes great the next day too) but the service is definitely what brings people back.    We went to Melt late on a Monday night and apparently it was a strangely empty night. No wait was necessary but I have heard the stories of the three hour waits... I wouldn't be down for that.  What a great idea... a restaurant serving grilled cheese and almost nothing else. Yes, there are burgers and other things if you aren't feeling cheesy."}
{"text":"Way to crowed. An hour wait. Good was huge. Took half of sandwich home was a little greasy, but good. Fried pickles are spears and awesome. Good service. Waiter was especially attentive and friendly. Wait time for food & drinks was minimal.  All in all good experience. Be awhile before we return as to wait time."}
{"text":"Great bar! Amazing beer list. Very good sandwiches - Try the Monte Cristo it rocks! Be prepared to wait, a long time(like 2- 3 hours long) unless you get lucky and snag a bar seat. The sandwiches are ridiculously large, and come with fries and coleslaw. Have never ate more than half of one (but always have room for another IPA!) Bartenders are very knowledgeable and friendly.  We make the hour and a half drive here a least every other month (and hit the West Side Market just down the road for great local meat and produce)."}
{"text":"Another fantastic experience at Melt East. We arrived well after 10:00 pm, thereby missing the brutal wait, and were served promptly and attentively by the excellent Anthony.   My first experience with the Breakfast Burger proved that Melt does burgers as well as they do their signature grilled cheese. The patty was juicy and cooked perfectly, the bacon crisp and of exactly the right thickness, and the eggs cooked expertly, so that the yolk was gelatinous but not runny.   BBQ Hoisin Brussels sprouts made a fantastic starter, and the fries were even more heavenly than usual: We got the impression they were seasoned more heavily than in the past, something I hope is a permanent change. Honestly, folks, I don't see how you could do better for the price."}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches and great value. Good drinks, nice adult environment that offers adult versions of grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"We had always wanted to eat here but put it off because we had heard it was quite expensive.  Well, we've been there twice now and have found that not to be true.  It is no higher priced than any other place of it's time.  The wait staff is AMAZING.  VERY friendly, very attentive.  Just awesome.  The atmosphere....The decor is very cool.  Very interesting.  There's a lot to look at.  My only complaint, I find the music to be a bit loud.  The food.  Absolutely amazing.  Actually, amazing maybe doesn't even cover it.  Portions are HUGE.  It's at least two meals for us each.  The fries are very yummy and there is a big variety of different sandwiches to choose from.  The first time I had a holiday special.  The Turkey bomber.  It had:  Turkey, stuffing, gravy and cranberry sauce.  I wish they had it all the time.  The second time I had the one with the deep fried mac and cheese.  The place is truly amazing.  Don't let talk of prices scare you off.  They are moderately priced, not expensive."}
{"text":"Always a must-visit every time I visit Northeast Ohio.  I'm a huge fan of Melt, and the Melt in Independence is my favorite location.   The sandwiches are amazing. They're delicious and huge. They have seasonal specials every month. My personal favorite Melt is the grilled PB & banana.  The seasoned fries that come with your sandwich are super yummy.  Melt has a huge beer selection with a monthly draft special.   Wait times can be a bit rough, but you can always grab a seat at the bar if you are 21+.  Prices are very, very fair."}
{"text":"Went w/wife, brother and soon to sis in law on a Friday Night.  We had to wait about 45 minutes for a seat.  Place is Hip and full of life.   Its worth the wait and worth the weight you'll put on...secret is the fries, very good food.  The bar list is long, Im not much of a beer drinker and I ordered Guiness...big mistake, the sandwiches are BIG and the cheese is BIGGER.  Order a light beer that wont sit heavy cuz the sandwich is a comfort meal.   Waitress was nice but Wife never got her mayo she asked for 3 xs.  I ordered a meatball sandwich and Wife ordered Blackened Chicken.  Both were excellent, tasty and awesome.   Brother got Prime Rib and it had red skinned mash potatoes on top...yummy.  they keep a standard menu and also have a monthly special.  Theyre also starting a new Melt in town.  Great as a leftover btw. A must if you visit Cleveland"}
{"text":"This was on our Bucket List after seeing it on Man vs. Food.  Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the R&R Hall Of Fame.  I was glad we went in the afternoon as I think it would be crowded and noisy on a weekend night.  We started out with Fried Green Tomatoes (very good) and I had the Monte Cristo (excellent) and my wife had the Godfather, a sandwich made with lasagna (yes, lasagna), which she said was excellent.  The servers were efficient and helpful (even at shift change), and drinks were refilled without being asked.  Should I ever return to Cleveland, I would definitely include a stop at Melt."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Melt. Let it be known. Any time I'm in need of some \"I'm feeling like being alone and gluttonous,\" I get it to go. And it's a good spot to sit and have a few beers with friends. I've had several sandwiches from Melt, my favorites being \"The Dude Abides,\" and \"The War Pig.\" The bread pudding is good too. Share it though or you may wind up in a diabetic coma."}
{"text":"This place is unique to Cleveland, and a novel restaurant idea, but extremely unhealthy. The dishes are literally a heart attack on a plate. You can squeeze a puddle of grease out of every grilled cheese sandwich. And portion sizes are ginormous, even by American standards."}
{"text":"I started coming to this great place before it was cool.  Before it was on the Food Network.  Before Adam Richman came and pounded a 4lb grilled cheese sandwich.  Before everyone in the city wanted to come here and yes, before there was a hostess and a 2 hour wait.  Matt Fish has made some amazing choices for his menu.  From his savory concoctions of perogies, kraut, and cheddar to his sweet options of peanut butter and bananas with sweet cream cheese.   This place is lined with great Cleveland memorabilia and has an atmosphere that is original and comforting.  If you are in Cleveland all the time or swinging through on a road trip, block out 2 hours and wait for your table."}
{"text":"I feel like I am wasting my time writing a review because of how high this is rated already, but the place lives up to the hype.  I had to wait an hour but I guess that is standard.   Seeing as this place was featured on Man V. Food I wanted to try it out. I didn't go with the Five Pound Challenge but I did order on the best sandwiches I have ever consumed: The Northcoast Shores.  It is made up of crabcakes, garlic spinach, roasted red peppers, and a cream cheese spread. The sandwich is incredibly rich but delicious. I could hardly breath after finishing but so satisfied.  Took a nap afterwards..."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese is my favorite food so of course I am going to be a fan of this place, however I do feel like its over priced. You do get a ton of food but the combos are not something I really liked. Its a great place to go for a double date or you want to grab a bite to eat before a game downtown."}
{"text":"Come hungry. Portion sizes were huge. I ordered the New Bomb Turkey Melt. The sandwich was delicious, the beer selection was solid and the service was excellent. Would have given it 5 stars, but it was so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"I ordered in from this place, so I can't say much for the decor.   But no thanks! I got two sandwiches and they were both dripping of butter!!!! I felt like I was eating straight-up butter!!!  1. Mushroom Melt- couldn't taste the mushroom because the onions were too sweet 2. Chorizo Melt- better than the mushroom but still not very flavorful  I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Might be one of my shortest reviews.  If you like a sandwich with a lot of something on it, with plenty of cheese all over it, then this is your place.  Several people with multiple choices and all of them good.  I had the Special of the month called the Kevin Bacon.  7 different types of bacon on one sandwich and it was great.  Fries were good.  Had two types of cider on tap that were very good since I am off of the beer kick.  Employees were very hipster with a lot of tats, piercings and wool caps on.  Seating was tight, but that can be overlooked.  Nice venue."}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place isn't closer to my home or office, because their sandwiches are over-the-top fantastic.  I had the Monte Cristo, which was deep fried, and then hit with some powdered sugar. A little sweet, but a lot delicious. And the fries were excellent, too.   Now I'm a big guy ... 6'2\" and 250 lbs ... but this turned out to easily be 2 meals for me. And while we were there, everyone left with a to go box, so I'm guessing no matter what you order, the servings are plentiful."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Cleveland Ohio and lived in Lakewood for 10 years before I moved to California and when came back to visit this past August (2017) after being away for years, I couldn't wait to try this place out after all my friends were bragging about it.  We went in a group of 6 adults and 4kids. And we waited only about ten minutes while they seat it table up. The waiter was super friendly and funny and was very patient with all of our questions as \"first timers\".  We all ordered something different and agreed to share. Glad we did, we tried Philly cheesesteak, the big popper(that one was my fav but probably would have preferred the pickled jalapeños) and I'd like to add it wasn't spicy at all. And a couple of other ones. We all were very satisfied. But my all time fav and I still think about until now was our appetizer. It was fried green tomatoes with this super yummy chipotle sauce! Oh, I can't wait to come back and have that again!  Overall our experience was nice. The parking was kinda hard and the bathrooms downstairs was kinda weird but it was cool when you go down there you see in the hallway a signed poster of Guy Fieri  from the show triple D."}
{"text":"The pictures look great but the food is bland , rude servers slow service these was no special touch to this place"}
{"text":"Oh boy. It's a good thing I do not live anywhere near this place or I'd weigh a literal ton. This place has a fun atmosphere. I like that instead of taking your name you draw a ridiculous one from the bucket. I appreciate the effort at making the experience unique. \"Whoopsie Daisy?\" Yea... that's' us.... :)   After what feels like 4 hours I've now had time to drool over the menu and convince myself not to order 17 sandwiches so I ordered buffalo tofu for an app which was spectacular and I've since hacked it and figured out how to make something very similar at home. ***insert evil laugh*** Sigh.  I can however not make any of their delicious melts at home. I can't remember the clever name of the melt I ordered... Parmageddon?? perhaps, it had perogies and cheese, and love baked right in. Oh and they're ginormous. Of course I could actually only consume about half of it (damn you buffalo tofu for occupying my stomach!) but regardless the food was spot on. The whole thing's a bit gluttonous but its supposed to be. Enjoy it. If you're in Cleveland and don't eat at Melt your making a HUGE mistake. Do it, you're taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Hip ambience and super duper grilled cheese (in name only) sandwiches make this a destination. You won't believe the size of the servings until you've dined there at least once and even then maybe not."}
{"text":"The place is definitely overrated but it was still a quality experience. Our server (mike) was very nice and helpful and the beer list is good. Food was a little disappointing but fine. Agreed that the cole slaw is worthless."}
{"text":"Yummy......Split a Summer Chicken and a Municipal Stadium Magic grilled cheese...It was like angel kisses on my lips. They have a great beer selection with as many tasty beers as sandwiches. The only thing missing from the dining experience is a couch and a pillow after you devour all that cheese!"}
{"text":"The life of a Sandwichologist is not an easy one. Sometimes you are required to leave your area of comfort and head off into the great wide open in search of elusive sandwiches that may be ripe with DANGER.  For my first adventure away from Los Angeles, I decided to make a stop at Melt Bar & Grilled in Cleveland, OH (note: technically it's Lakewood).  Now this being my first time to Cleveland, I had no idea what deliciousness lay in hiding from me. Thank you to reader, Melanie for the suggestion.  Upon arriving at Melt, I was greeted by a half hour wait to be seated. But trust me, if you're ever in Cleveland, the wait is worth it, so mark this down on your GPS.  The menus are almost overwhelming at first. Printed on the back of old LPs, there are quite a lot of variations of grilled cheese sandwiches and melts to take in. Thankfully, with the King on the back of my menu, I picked \"The Winter Chicken Melt\" which contains grilled chicken, honey tomato chipotle sauce, and pepper jack on toasted sourdough bread.  I feel like i should take a moment to explain something about my sandwich preferences.  Sourdough is my absolute favorite type of bread. Nothing tops it. Yes, rye is good in certain situations, and challah has its moments as well, but nothing is as delicious as well made sourdough.  Seriously, if you gave me a sandwich on Sourdough, we could have Northridge (the famed 6.7 magnitude 1994 earthquake) Part 2, and as my apartment collapsed around me i would blissfully munch away on its deliciousness.  That being said, this sandwich had the most perfectly grilled, lightly buttered sourdough. It got your fingers a little greasy when you picked the sandwich up, but not too overpowering to make the taste overpowering.  The chicken has been lightly grilled, and is incredibly tender and very juicy. After it's been cooked, it is bathed in a very light honey tomato chipotle sauce. While chipotle can sometimes be overpowering, and even too spicy for some people, this sauce is a smooth smokey flavor that adds a nice bit of pep to the sandwich. Top it all off with melted pepper jack and you have one delicious melt.  If you get the chance to go to Melt, i also highly recommend the fries (perfectly crisp and lightly seasoned) and the sweet slaw (cole slaw...but sweet)."}
{"text":"We had the cheese wedges for an app. it was more than enough for two. They're were really good. We each ordered cheese burgers and could have just shared. I got through half and couldn't even think of eating the other half. The fries were good and so was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Huge craft beer list. The bartenders are knowledgeable, efficient and friendly. In fact, all the staff (chefs, greeters, et al) are very friendly. The menu basically consists of different types of grilled cheese, but there's enough variety that you should be able to find something here that you like. It's basically one huge room: a long bar on one end, and tables throughout the remainder, so there's no cozy little booths. On the whole, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"How could anyone not like this place.  This is pure craziness on a sandwich that will make you come back for more!  On the website they also take suggestions for new sandwiches.  The food is incredible and Cleveland is lucky to have someone like Matt Fish to deliver the best Sandwiches hands down!!  And if you are feeling crazy you can do the 5lb challenge.  Yes that is right 5 pounds of cheese, 14 different cheeses.  Plus the dining atmosphere is very cool.  Great place well run!!  Amazing food.  But make sure you are hungry!!!"}
{"text":"It's a novel idea. But my sandwich was mostly thick dry chunks of bread. It just was way below being good. Somewhere along the line they lost the meaning of their name."}
{"text":"A year ago, we left Cleveland for the sunshine and warmth of South Carolina.  No regrets, but we miss our friends and certain Cleveland restaurants.  When we knew we were going up to Cleveland for a wedding, Melt was the #1 place we knew we had to go while in town.  My husband dreams about their tofu buffalo wings. We met family for lunch on a Saturday and had no problem getting a table.  Our server was great and patient with us--we were so busy talking and catching up that it took us a while to decide what to order.  My husband and I split the tofu wings (this vegetarian DOES NOT like tofu; these \"wings\" are delicious!).  Whether you eat meat or not, I recommend these.  They are perfectly crusted and fried and the barbecue sauce is right on point.  We also shared a cup of tomato soup  (dammit, Cleveland, it was cold out in September!), which is always good.  For our meal, we split the vegan burger.  This was the first time we'd tried this sandwich and it was great--I'm not sure what all was involved in the patty, but it seemed to have a lot more going on that a standard veggie burger and it was nice and thick.  As always, we left completely stuffed and happy.   I think the thing that I love best about Melt is that what is basically a grilled cheese restaurant is one of the best places for a vegan or vegetarian to eat.  There are so many choices and it's easy to customize your meal.  Other restaurants could learn a lot from Melt in this area."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh.... I have to come here every time I visit family back in Cleveland... thank God there wasn't one of these on campus in college; I would would have been a blimp!  The food here is amazing!  You can't go wrong with any sandwich!"}
{"text":"Seeing as I'm from the south, what else was expected of me other than ordering the Fried Green Tomato BLT? I just had to pit this delicious sounding creation against my southern-bred palate, and it did not disappoint.   I added a fried egg over easy to my BLT, since I'm a sucker for runny yolk, and both the waiter and the bus boy/food runner commented on how delicious an add-on it looked to be. There were what I counted to be three layers of well-diametered fried tomatos, which retained crunchiness very well. The remoulade was creamy and a good degree of spicy, and provided most of the flavoring for the sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised by the choice of bread - I'm assuming it was pieces of thick sourdough french bread. Much better than what I thought would be gigantic pieces of Texas toast.   The only things I think might have made the sandwich better was a little more salt in the batter for the tomato or on top of the egg, and a little more remoulade sauce (then again it might be plenty salty for most - I am a notorious over-salter...). The fries were also underwhelming, but the fries aren't what people come to this place for ;)  I also assumed the sandwich was going to be smaller than the monstrous size it was - I had looked around at others' tables and realized post-grilled-cheese-arrival that while sandwhiches looked large a few feet away, they were absolutely ginourmous when placed right in front of you. I struggled to finish off just half of my BLT, as did my boyfriend, who ordered the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken Melt (he substituted goat cheese  for the blue cheese crumbles and was very satisfied with the results).   To accompany my food, I drank a Peeeach, (pronounced similar to the slur 'bee-otch') one of their summer cocktails. I cant remember what it was made of but I do remember that it wasn't overpoweringly strong and that it had a good level of sweetness.   I definitely recommend this place to locals and visitors alike! I'm planning on eating here again during my next visit to Cleveland in a few weeks."}
{"text":"I was visiting friends in Lakewood for the weekend and Melt is the first place they took me. Oh. My. Goodness. This place is amazing!! Please open a location in Chicago!!  You would think a chicken and waffles sandwich would have the waffles as bread. No, not Melt. A huge piece of fried chicken with a huge waffle piled between two giant hunks of cheese and bread. Can't believe I ate the whole thing. I'm still full 4 days later.  Next time I'm in Cleveland I will definitely come back here. Except maybe I'll save half the sandwich for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"holy crap on toast.  see, with this review i can actually say my little catch phrase and yet, it could be extremely relevant.  who ever thought that could happen, right?  except melt doesn't have crap on toast.  they have really amazing stuff on toast.  seriously.  the menu is overwhelmingly awesome.  you can make pretty much anything your pretty little heart desires with whatever type of cheese, veggies, meats, and tasty relishes.  yuuuuuuuuum  another great place in the wood by the lake.  not only do they have amazing sandwiches (i had the summer chicken with havarti- sooooo good, says the teen girl squad), but they also have a kick ass beer collection.  i mean, they have DEAD GUY ALE!!!  dead guy ale is from rogue river, oregon.  and because melt is smart enough to carry dead guy, they already won cool points.  it's the principal of carrying dead guy ale, not necessarily the fact that it's good.  ick.  however, they have wyder's pear cider on tap.  THAT is good stuff.  but if you don't appreciate beer by those whom are now deceased, they have so many options to choose from.  domestic, microbrews, imported, light, dark, sweet, fruity...they have it all.  i was happy.  AND THEY HAVE FRIED TWINKIES FOR DESSERT.  not too mention, as the other great yelpers have, the fun, kitchy decor and adorable vinyl covers as menus.  melt, you win. you win my ever-lovin' midwestern eclectic heart.  don't break it.   cuz you break it, you buy it.  what????  how did we get here? um... melt. good.  though  this place is *always* PACKED.  prepare for waits.  no matter what time of day.  overall, melt was awesome.  i'm glad it exists.  and my arteries thank you for your fried twinkies, too.  oh, my ass does too."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews covered the obvious:  long (well worth) wait, good food, good service.  Beer selection was nice.  Menu takes some reading, but worth it and the vodka kraut was excellent.  Seems like it would be ideal for late night dining."}
{"text":"An entire restaurant paying hommage to the greatest culinary invention?  YES.    I went to college in Cleveland, but Melt opened right after I graduated.  Thank goodness for my glorious return this past weekend.  There were so many choices that the entire table took over 10 minutes to decide.  Everything sounded delicious!  I finally settled on the sandwich called the Backyard BBQ.  The sandwich included full sized onion rings, tons of cheese, BBQ sauce, brisket.  It was fab-u-lous!  The thick cut fries that came along were also amazing.  If you have a limited amount of time Cleveland - go here!"}
{"text":"I've gotten take out from Melt several times, as well as eating there. I've had the big popper, pb and banana, monte crisco, chicken and waffles, the bushwood, and I've never had a bad sandwich. Usually good draft selection too. As long as you're super hungry and ready to pig out, Melt is a good option!"}
{"text":"Went back to the Lakewood location a few weeks ago with some out-of-towners who have been wanting to see what all the hype is about.  We knew the best thing to do to avoid a long wait was to arrive at 10:45am to get in as soon as they opened since we had a group of 5.  The service was good, and everyone enjoyed the food.  I had the monthly special corn-dog, which was just immense.  Could have easily been given half and still thought the portion was large.  It was fun to get to try several different sandwiches since we all shared, but none of the stuff reheats very well, so taking home 3/4 of your plate is a waste.  I tried the blackened chicken, gyro, parmageddon, and dude abides.  The meatballs in the dude abides were disappointing, but the others were all good.    My husband went back again yesterday to the Independence location with one of his buddies, and brought me back a bite of his godfather because I \"just had to try it.\"  Even reheated it was pretty good.  Definitely better than I thought a lasagna sandwich would be.  He said this was the best Melt sandwich he's had.  Overall I'm taking Melt down a star because it's just so, so greasy.  It's a fun place to take people, and I really appreciate their beer selection.  But having eaten there twice in the last 6 months, I'm hoping not to go back for a couple years at least."}
{"text":"The wait for a chance to eat in the place would have you believe they were serving the most wonderful food in the world.  The sandwich I ate the the Ruben which is average at best. The one highlight of this experience was the bread which was pretty good.  I also ordered a cup of the tomato soup which tasted like a cup of chunky pasta sauce, literally it tasted like they poured some Ragu out of the bottle/can warmed it up and called it soup... absolutely the worst tomato soup I have ever tasted.  The sweet slaw was full of pepper and tasted anything but sweet.  The fries were also full of pepper, the ketchup was not able to hide the pepper so I had to leave a pile of perfectly good fries to be thrown away.  The bar had plenty of options which might entice people to come and enjoy Melt but the food was bad enough to where I would probably never return."}
{"text":"Like many previous reviewers, I saw this establishment on many TV shows. The mega sized grilled cheeses are amazing. I got the firecracker chicken grilled cheese. I highly recommend it. Also a good selection of local craft beers. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Omgsh I ordered the 1/2 kindergarten with vegan cheddar, sautéed onions and peppers and spinach and it was delish! The customer service was pretty smooth from the person who took my order over the phone as well as the 2 ladies who greeted me when I picked it up. Only problem was that some of the chips were a little too salty for me. I will definitely be returning but next time I will get a whole one instead of half! Great job Melt!"}
{"text":"My favorite location of the three I've been to, with the original in Lakewood, and University Heights being the other two.  By far the largest location; when my friend and I went to Lakewood, we had to wait over a half hour for lunch, as they literally only have a handful of tables (unless they've expanded since then).  I kept it super simple last time since I was just getting over a cold, and opted just for a basic grilled cheese (the Kindergarten) and was pretty impressed with it -- their selection of cheese helps.  Their fries are amazing!  The Monte Cristo is also excellent, and is very similar to the version they made at Bennigan's.  One of my favorite places to go when I visit NE Ohio!"}
{"text":"It's good but I'm not overly impressed. I think this place got more hype than it needed. But the food has tasted good every time Ive gone (not great). And service has been ok but not great. Nothing wrong with this chain, just not quite worth the hype in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch today.   Got there at 11:30 before the rush began, line out the door when we left.  The menu is quite impressive with selections (who knew you could do so many variations on a cheese sandwich.)   Portions are huge, almost too much.   I ate my sandwich, a few fries, and a few forks of slaw and was full.     Trying to eat more healthily, I had to scour the menu for something with less saturated fat (why did I come there then you ask?   because it was convenient for my business companion.)   With some searching and inquiry I was able to get a healthier option by getting the spinach sandwich with just a dusting of feta.   I was warned they put way too much cheese in every sandwich, and judging from the tables around us I can see what they mean.    The sandwich (basically a version of spanokopita) was actually excellent.  Nice portion of well-cooked spinach, just the right amount of feta, grilled red peppers and onions.  The bread was great...thick sliced white bread, crusty on the outside and soft inside.   And the filling was moist, even without the cheese, so the bread soaked up the juices.    The slaw was horrible.   Couldn't eat it....too much raw onion and chili flakes.   I normally like non-mayo slaw and big flavors, but this was inedible.   The fries were fine, but way too salty.  And enough for 2 people on the plate.    Service was typical for a casual joint...harried waitress and too-eager busboy trying to clear the table, probably to get us out of there for the rest of the folk in line.   I've had friendlier greet staff at Cracker Barrel than this place.   They need to work on the service aspect.   Trendy casual doesn't mean indifferent service.  And they need to put more obvious healthy options on the menu.   While you can get vegan and vegetarian versions of many sandwiches and burgers, you have to dig around and think about it and look for the little \"V\"  Almost none of the soups or appetizers are outright healthy."}
{"text":"YES. All the deliciousness without the major wait and attitude of the Lakewood location. Yes, I said it. Attitude. Snark. I don't enjoy it! But the Rockside Melt folks are really nice. I'm a big fan of nice. And sandwiches. And melted cheese. So, there you go."}
{"text":"This was the first time we have been to the Melt. My sister used to live in Cleveland and fell in love with it, swearing by the size of the sandwiches. So when she was up visiting last week from Youngstown, we decided to give it a shot.   They told us it was a 45 minute wait, but it ended up being 20 minutes. This was around 5:30 on a Friday night. By the time we sat down, though, there were people out the door.   We were a party of 4, and sat at a 4 top. We were pretty much in the middle of the restaurant and it was LOUD. Extremely loud. We had to yell to hear each other, and the table wasn't that big.   Husband ordered a wine, son ordered a monkey butt beer or something strange  and my sister and I stayed with water and iced tea. The wine came in a small cocktail glass, maybe 4 ounces, for $6 or something close. The son's beer came for $5.50 each, too.  The husband got the clam chowder, because he's a bona fide chowder snob, and he said it lacked salt and pepper, and tasted processed. It was also dropped off with goldfish crackers, so though there was a hint of humor, you don't add cheese to seafood (don't they watch Chopped???)  Husband got the Philly cheesesteak, sister wanted crabcake sandwich that they no longer provide, so she got the backyard BBQ, son got the municipal stadium and I did the fish and puppies.   Husband couldn't stop raving about the cheesesteak and ate almost all of it, except for the crust on the second half. He even ate his fries, and he hates potatoes!  Son plowed through his first half but saved the second half and some fries for home, however, he said he'd definitely get it again.  Sister did the same on hers. And she's an extremely picky eater! I was really surprised she got BBQ, because that's not her normal MO, but she chowed down.  Mine, since I could take it apart and describe it to you, came as 2 stacked thick pieces of haddock, on top of Texas toast type bread, with a cole slaw topping and jalepeno tartar sauce. I always switched out the cheese (again, Chopped???) to Swiss, and I should have asked that the hush puppies not be on the sandwich. But it was literally 5 inches tall. See my picture! And I thought the jalepeno tartar sauce may be too spicy for my tastes but amazingly, it added just the right kick to what can often be a very plain, boring sandwich. I brought half home because it was just way too much food for one sitting.  The fries were decent, but I like fair fries better. I added vinegar and salt and still, they just tasted bland to me.  Husband, sister and son can't wait to go back. I like sandwiches, but I'll wait.  ;)  And I'd probably get something else next time."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Columbus plenty of times, but this was my first time back at the original Melt in a while. Like the Melt in Columbus, the servers/bartenders were friendly and fantastic, and the place had great decor and a cool vibe. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the cleanliness of the place at all compared to the Columbus location. The bartenders were talking about how they couldn't get the glasses clean with the glass cleaner, and I was practically sticking to the bar table. Even worse, fruit flies were EVERYWHERE!! I could see them in the window in the kitchen, and they were all around the bar. Honestly the place just needs to be scrubbed from top to bottom. For that many fruit flies, it just means that they aren't cleaning up the alcohol well enough. ~"}
{"text":"Incredible grilled cheese sandwiches along with an excellent choice of beers.  This place used to have regular 3 hour waits, but now that there are several other Melt's in Cleveland the wait time seems to have come way down.  The monthly specials add some nice variety to the menu.  Speaking of variety, every time is come in here the beer choices have changed.  Always top notch stuff and also a monthly beer special."}
{"text":"Came here after hearing several positive reviews via word of mouth.  I was incredibly disappointed.  Came for dinner on a Thursday evening with a friend and was told there was a 45-60 minute wait for a table.  No big deal, we decided to sit at the bar.  After ordering, it took over an hour for our food to arrive; we were ready to get up and leave when the food finally arrived.  I ordered a simple burger, medium rare, it was nothing special and overcooked.  The fries were similarly overcooked.  The entire dining experience took over 2 hours, and this was sitting at the bar, where you'd typically expect a fast turnaround.  Stay away.  In a nutshell, slow service, mediocre food."}
{"text":"Come hungry!!  Gluten free & vegan friendly! I am here on business and was told \"Melt is a must try while you're in town\". It was wonderful!  I started with a lavender mojito which was great. I ordered the Summer chicken (pulled chicken, arugula, tomato, light sauce, & havarti cheese). Yum!  Their fries are hand cut and are to die for!!  There was so much food (2 sandwiches) I couldn't finish it all. I ended my meal with one more drink- a Melt Tiki. Yum!  This place is a really fun atmosphere with funky decor, great food & an awesome and amazing bar selection!"}
{"text":"Wait...you mean I can order these sandwiches online via Deliver Me Food, watch tv and putz around for an hour and get the grease delivered to my door within only half the time it would take to wait for a table?! Ok, sure!!  Just pour yourself a good beer, put an '80s movie on auto-loop, and throw some record covers around your place, and it will feel like you're really there.  To get the most realistic effect: drink your beer while standing up for the entire time you're waiting for the food to be delivered. Then get really cranky and snap at someone. Then devour your sandwich too fast and experience mild regret afterwards, followed by Tums. enjoy!"}
{"text":"This location is large and very clean. My waitress at this location was great and very funny. It was the first time I witnessed a MELT Challenge ( I almost gagged when she told me what was included). The draft list is pretty good but they only have 2 items on their dessert menu. I like that nowadays you can get half orders."}
{"text":"I'm not going to talk about the food, wait or surprising lack of one, service, etc... I am reviewing the drink menu! You don't have to sit or wait for a waitress and eventually you'll get a seat at the bar...in under 15 minutes, I guarantee it!   Phenomenal!! Most drinks are around $5 and so unique. An example would be the mojito with fresh lavender ground into it. The cold sangria is almost the best I've had, excluding my own! The dirty martini with feta stuffed olives that I first had on special as the drink of the month for $4! I love the fact that I can have four generously poured, creative, tasty drinks for $20 whenever I come, not just during happy hour."}
{"text":"Eh, not bad.  I loved the atmosphere, and WISHED this place had been in Lakewood when I lived down the road 20 years ago...My only complaint, for a place called \"Melt,\" known for grilled cheese for the hipster crowd and gourmand tourist, one should be able to find the cheese on their sandwich without a map.  The bread tasted great, sliced thick like \"Texas toast,\" but too thick...to have a slice of cheese, one layer of tomato and one layer of bacon, the sandwich was dry as hell.  Tasty, but dry from way too much bread.  We had 3 adults and 4 kids in our party and the server seemed to handle the crowd ok enough, only...for our party, majority kids, they included the 20% gratuity.  No bigs, anyone that knows me, knows I will tip more than 20% if the service was great and/or, they've had to deal with a group that includes a.) my mother b.) my 4 nieces and nephews aged 9 and younger.  So, seriously?  This hipster dude was not seeing another penny from me.  When I asked him if they normally include gratuity for parties of 6 or more, he said yes and I told him too bad, I would have tipped more than 20% simply due to the crowd control at our table alone...his reply \"I'm not greedy, I'm fine with 20%.\"  Yeah dude, and your service reflected the fact you had a built in tip.  \"Parties of 6, 7 or 8 or more\" rules usually apply to individual paying adults to discourage 6, 7 or 8 separate bills.  Duh.  I doubt I'll be back to Melt.  When your niche product is something that most of us have mastered in our own kitchens, you betta bring it with the service, especially when a party of 6 can expect to pay $80 (including tip) for lunch.  Yes, LUNCH.  If I were in SF, I'd expect the attitude AND the pricing, but c'mon, Cleveland??  Get over yourself.   Decent enough food, but Cleveland and Lakewood have better options..."}
{"text":"After two dinners at this location, I am pleased to announce my official delegation of the best 'for your money' restaurant in Cleveland. Not only is the food delicious and the beer selection is awesome, but the atmosphere is very appealing. the management does a wonderful job making sure the customer gets what they want. I have two awesome experiences and hope to enjoy similiars ones in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food, service, and atmosphere. Abundant servings and superb taste."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, Gourmet sandwhiches, and vegetarian/vegan choices. I had the mighty mac melt, it was Huge and delicious highly recommend it! The sides are great too, had the general kung pow broccoli and tried my friend's general tsaos Brussels sprouts, delicious!  Everyone in our party was completely satisfied, it was hard not to succumb to the food coma on the long ride back to Toledo (thankfully I wasn't driving, lol). TOLEDO WE NEED A LOCATION  ASAP!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had been looking to come to Melt for months, and I mean MONTHS. We finally got the chance to stop in and have some of their food. First, the interior is cool. Its like a local grunge shop in the form of a restaurant, which is actually cool, a little different. The restaurant is split both half's are seats but one is the bar obviously while one is full dining. The interior also tries to blend old school with new school which is super dope.   We went on a Saturday night, which was pretty Goofy to do. They were super busy and the wait was up to an hour, I'm honestly not complaining because we were aware of how popular they are. Eventually we were able to just skip our wait and eat at the bar. Finny was the bartender and the one who served us. Super nice and funny. We ordered drinks, I ordered the red sun rising and my wife ordered the PEEAAAACH. Both drinks were amazing. We then ordered their fries Mac n cheese, crunchy, flavorful and creamy. 4 come in the appetizer which is perfect and doesn't stuff you   For our entrees I ordered the backyard BBQ which can come in either chicken, pork, or beef. I ordered pork and oh my... The pork was tender and juicy and the BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy. The sandwich comes with an onion ring on it which is just, ughhh excellent. My wife ordered the wet hot Buffalo chicken, she demolished it without even speaking so I assume it was pretty good. It's the ultimate greasy food place. get a few drinks, soak them up with some great huge servings of meat."}
{"text":"One word...crazy noisy.  So much so that conversation with dining companions suffers.  The food is excessive in all ways with no finesse whatsoever.  Would not return. This place gets by on the perception of tastiness."}
{"text":"The only item I will get from Melt is the No. 1 Awesome Noodle Salad.  A nice change up from the sandwiches.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"So I finally got my boyfriend to go to Melt! Guess what? He loved he's cheesesteak too! He's not a huge fan of cheese, that's why it's taken us so long to get here. But he's been proven wrong, it's not JUST grilled cheese. I tried the Smokey Russian, which is like a turkey Ruben. It was good. The dressing was very thin and lacking a punch of flavor like regular 1000 island, but I liked it. I am taking a star away, because our server wasn't great and call me old, but the music is way to loud when you can't hear the person 2 feet in front of you. It's not a night club, people actually come here to sit and talk while they eat. It's a good place for a once in awhile sandwich craving."}
{"text":"Yes it is great. What can I add that people haven't already said?  Plus I heard that if you have a tattoo of a melted cheese sandwich you get a discount.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"What you're going to find: Incredible food.  Incredible, vegetarian friendly food. In incredible, sharing friendly portions.  Served by incredible, happy, perky evangelist servers.    Who'da thunk a BBQ TVP sandwich option for their monthly BBQ monstrosity?  When I read that there were vegetarian and vegan options for their sambo of the month, I about fell out of my chair (and quickly ordered one).  The fries were crispy, hand-cut, and perfect. The cole slaw had no mayo in it (and undetectable oil, if there was any... ) which was a perfect offset to the buttery bread and cheeeeseee.   We also ordered buffalo tofu, and had no idea how they got the tofu so dense and perfect.  One of the things I miss as a vegetarian is hot wings (I know, don't judge)... and this was the closest thing I've had in years.  All sauces are homemade... and you can tell.    What you're not going to find:  something healthy.  I don't think I saw something on the menu that'd fit into a health category... but that's not why you are here. No.  You're here for the  bread...and the cheese.  Ooooh, the cheese."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, not a fan of the prices for the food options however. Could be more reasonable for a \"grilled cheese\" mostly consisting of bread."}
{"text":"Melt, you were exciting and new.  I always made the drive to Lakewood for the great, big, messy sandwiches, fun and lively atmosphere, and RC Cola in glass bottles, which brought back happy memories of my grandparents house, where there was always a cold stash in the fridge.  I loved that this was the one and only location, which made the concept and experience feel unique.  I told all my friends and family Melt was worth the drive no matter where they lived.  Melt has gone from a lone, special place in the burbs, to a Cleveland version of every place that is not satisfied enough to stand on it's own.  When you keep expanding and can't be everywhere as your empire grows, the quality, experience, and food suffer.  The sandwiches seem smaller than I remember, the fries are just a mushy, clump of starch, and the slaw which I loved (I know some people hate the stuff, but each his own), and to my dismay, no more RC Cola!  Ah, I yearn for the good, old days..."}
{"text":"All Melts are created equal. Seriously, the decor is all modeled after the Lakewood original, the menus are the same, the atmosphere is the same and even the ceiling is the same. The food here is good and takes a lot of dedicated preparation to eat--I normally plan all of my food decisions for the whole day around a Melt visit. The fries are best soggy with vinegar and the bread is thick and greasy on all of the sandwiches. Delicious! No, really--I think things are delicious here, despite the massive portions and how disgusting your hands (and face) get after eating. The beer selection is good, though last time we were here, I got turned down for 2 beers that I had ordered from the menu. The coleslaw is...eh...but I don't really like any coleslaw. The desserts are just as elaborate and disgusting, but if you have room, I suggest trying one of the bread puddings. Such a rich and delicious mistake every time.   Really, Melt is a great every once in awhile restaurant (since it takes days to recover from it) and I can't find anything really wrong with the place."}
{"text":"Great and delicious grilled cheese. My husband and I came here a few times and always had a great experience. I took away a star only because the service isn't always amazing. Otherwise, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I hung out with my family and some friends. They have some really nice cocktails and the waitress was amazing. The entire ambience was very loud... exactly what i wanted after the game.   I got a long island ice tea and the moscow mule. Both the cocktails felt mild intially, but they hit in right away."}
{"text":"It was my first time at the Melt. I had a cheesesteak. Which was really good in my opinion. The fries were amazing, the sandwich was so big that I could barely fit it into my mouth to take a bite so for the portion size you pay for the price is pretty decent. I ordered the electric blueberry lemonade which was disappointing. It tasted like lemonade, you couldn't taste the vodka & there were about 20 mint leaves in the glass so it all got sucked into the straw whenever I attempted to drink any of it. I ordered the brau weisse afterward which was much better. We ordered the Oktoberfest dessert of the month which was supposed to be a bread pudding and instead we were served a brownie with ice cream on top of it. The dessert we received and the dessert we ordered were two completely separate dishes. The server was also the bartender & he was nice. I guess they need more staff. We ate outside on the patio which we basically had all to ourselves. I would come again but be more careful of what I order."}
{"text":"Another place my OH friends brought me to that they frequent often. This place has an explosion of randomness from Krispee Kreme & Dairy Queen signs which I don't believe they sell. Some video game screen titles over the beer coolers & random decorations for the upcoming holiday. Their menus are on the back of album covers which is different. Food wise I'm told they have a special every month which my friends have tried & sound amazing. I had the Monte Cristo which is deep fried w/ powdered sugar on top. It was amazing! Huge portions. The fries are okay, but their ranch I believe is home made. One of my friends at the Parma which I got to try & it was so tasty! The cheese was melted perfectly w/ the sandwich. The chicken didn't taste like any bar type food I had prior.  Another friend had the Godfather & he said it was like 'heaven in his mouth'. I chose not to try it as he seemed to not want to share w/ the group, that's how good he thought it was.  Slow service during peak hours, but very casual environment. Def wishing one of these would pop up in my neck of the woods on the west coast. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"A-Mazing....this is a reason to go to Cleveland all by itself. The Tokyo Tuna Melt is fantastic and the Pirogi sandwich is crazy good too. I used to have to go to Cleveland for work and no matter where I was or what I was doing I went to Melt. I have been to all of the locations and my favorite is the original but if you're closer to the other places don't worry about it...just make it to one of them."}
{"text":"I'm going to try to make it here every time I have to come to Ohio for work. It's definately worth it."}
{"text":"We were heading to Cleveland for a weekend away while the Red Sox would be in town. After searching through recommendations on Food Network, my pregnant self was sold on heading to an all grilled cheese restaurant. We headed to this location on our first down in town for lunch. The staff was super friendly and service was very quick.  I ordered the Parmagedon and it was exactly what I was in the mood for. Perogies and cheese on a sandwich? Awesome! My boyfriend ordered the Prime Rib melt, which was the special of the month. It was fantastic, especially with the delicious horseradish sauce on the side.   So many great options on the menu, and we were really pleased with every aspect of our visit. Of course, we needed to get out to walk it all off afterwards, but it was well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Oh Melt, how you taunt me by being so far away. Open a store in Los Angeles, please? I know, you would not be so cool without your Cleveland sports and music memorabilia, but we could still enjoy your cheesy awesomeness, no? Especially the lasagna grilled cheese, oh my that was something else!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the hype about this place. The food is average as far as melts go, nothing special. EXTREMELY GREASY."}
{"text":"Grilled Expectations  Intro:  Adam brought me here. I visit the Cleveland area a lot now and each time I go, I am on a desperate search to find anything that is worth my time and energy.  I've been spoiled by the variety that DC has to offer.  Apparently, Cleveland specializes in \"American\" food, so i have to work with sandwiches and french fries. Fair enough.  Ambiance:  Alright... when I saw this place on Man Vs Food (yea, that Adam), I didn't realize exactly how \"metal\" this place is.  I'm not sure if heavy metal, death metal, or punk rock would be the most accurate description.  As a spiritual watchman, I am very keen to symbolism and satanic influence.  This place is bathed in satanic symbolism.  Everything from upside down crosses, lightening strikes, goat heads, creepy Easter bunnies, sun worship, etc.  Either way, the place is not for me, but I was already there and still wanted to try it.  I am not holding the theme of the restaurant against the establishment in this review because they are entitled to have whatever theme they choose.  Most would simply see it as rock, whereas I see the spiritual aspect of it.  Food:  I asked the bartender to recommend a sandwich and he recommended the Cuban War Pig.  It started off pretty good, but had a lot going on.  I'm not that heavy on the pork, so I probably should have gotten something else.  I found the bread to be a smidgen overwhelming by the end of the meal.  I wouldn't say that the meal was bad, but I was a tad bit disappointed, since I had MVF-like expectations.  For some reason, I was expecting these sandwiches to taste way better than they look, but they taste like they look...not bad, tad bit dry.  I will say that I got half a sandwich and it was a lot, so I can only imagine if I had gotten a whole order.  The french fries, on the other hand, were perfect lol.  Customer Service:  I went on a Wednesday around lunch.  It was not crowded, so I just sat at the bar.  The bartender had good customer service and didn't make any mistakes.  Kept my drink filled and wasn't over-the-top or inattentive.  great job on customer service.  In Conclusion.  Take some holy water and give it a shot.  I would possibly go back and try a different sandwich, but I'm not really down with the theme."}
{"text":"My favorite all around restaurant in Cleveland. Hands down the best draft beer prices and selection I have ever seen at any bar!!! They have over 15 craft beers on draft (no bud or miller lite in site) and tons of bottled beers. The food is amazing! Sandwiches range from $10-12 and i have yet to see anyone leave without a box . My girlfriend and I go once a week and split a vegan sandwich melt and the BUFFALO TOFU! Prepare yourself for a wait or do what I do and settle in at the bar. Melt is a must try if you live or are visiting Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"While I gave the other location five stars, this one only gets four for a couple of reasons. 1. I'm sentimentally attached to the Lakewood location. 2. While it is nice to have a little more elbow room, I don't feel like I'm friends with everyone who works here, whereas when you walk into the Lakewood location, they treat you like they've been waiting all day to see you. The Cedar location is more of a \"bring ten people and take over a corner of the restaurant\" place and the Lakewood location is more of a \"bring your date or best friend and lean in real close to hear each other, but also know what the three surrounding tables are talking about\" place.   But, this is Melt and a Melt is a Melt is a Melt. There's still a stellar menu of crazy sandwiches that will cover your hand in grease, fries that make you feel like you're at a county fair, and beer to no end. There's also still a wait every night, and you have to fight for bar seats. And you will more than likely have some crazy leftovers that will reheat fairly well in the oven tomorrow night.  I still love Melt, but I loved it more when it was unique.  Also, I'm still mad that brunch was axed. I could really go for an apple sausage waffle right now."}
{"text":"The Godfather, my oh my!!! Live in CA but occasionally come to Cleveland for business. I don't eat the entire day in anticipation of having Melt - so worth the hunger pains."}
{"text":"We love Melt! The menu is so huge its almost overwhelming. Theres always a new sandwich to try and yet your old favorites never disappoint either. Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Since I had heard a lot about the cheese melting that takes place here, I could not resist! Plus, they serve one of my favorites--Monte Cristo, which I had to try. Their version is prepared in a deep fried variety with plenty of cheeses and meats! The taste with the fried dough reminded me of an old fashion homemade jelly donut because of the sweet sauce that was served with it. It's a huge sandwich, enough to serve a big appetite for one or splitting it with someone. I couldn't handle it all, but it was very tasty. I would definitely get it again!"}
{"text":"Ahhh Melt. When I first moved to Cleveland I had to check out the DDD episode with it just to see what I was getting myself into. My first trip about a year ago was not so great as I had a small meal before meeting up with friends there on the spur of the moment. Going to Melt is all about planning. Now, the wife and I will decide on the sandwich we want and only order one. This is key. I have tried many times to finish a whole one on my own, and have failed miserably each time.  SHARE.  We also order the house salad with house dressing. I was really impressed by it the first time I ordered it, and have gotten it each time since.  The tangy bleu cheese and the sweetness of the dressing, really make for a unique salad that I wish I could replicate at home. We usually try different craft sodas when we go and have not come away disappointed. The ambiance is great, typical bar, but they always have on great TV channels ranging from sports, to Boomerang and Cartoon Network. If there was one aspect that I would choose to be a little disappointed with, it would be the service. We've never had a truly terrible server, but usually things just seem a little hectic.  Trying to flag someone down for a refill or condiment can be a challenge at times. That being said, going to Melt is definitely an experience that everyone should have! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Funky, interesting, and insane portion sizes of creative and tasty sandwiches. Would have been just as happy with half portions -- next time we'll share."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the new Avon location, as I have always had good experiences at the Lakewood and Cleveland Heights restaurants, but this place was a total disappointment!   My friend and I went to Melt at 7 pm the day before Thanksgiving. We expected it to be packed, but we're surprised to see the restaurant was half empty.  The hostess told us the wait time would be 10-15 mins, which was a little longer than we anticipated considering the amount of open tables, but we decided to stick around. About 25 mins later we were seated.   My friend and I both ordered half sandwiches and soup, which took about 35 minutes. Again, with a restaurant half empty, we were pretty annoyed.  Plus, the food was barely warm.  We could have given Melt a pass on the wait time if the food had knocked us off our seats, but unfortunately, that didn't happen.   Not a great first impression for the Avon location.  I'll give them another chance, but will probably wait until the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"What a great place, had the Pierogi grilled cheese and can't explain how good it was. The vibe in the bar was great had an NCAA tournament game on right next to a tv showing Scooby Doo for the kids. Wait staff was on point with Drinks, food and cleaning up and that's with a packed restaurant and an hour wait at the door.   The sandwiches were amazing and HUGE portions and the gravy on the Hangover fries are about as good as it gets.  Please open one in Detroit!"}
{"text":"This place is a must-visit for any out-of-towner who wants to eat food that the people in Cleveland consider \"good food\". My friends at Case Western took me here, and let me just say, it did not disappoint. The pricing is good (as it should be--it's Cleveland after all) and the portions are both humongous and delicious. I got to sample a few melts which were all super tasty. The one I ordered was a special called a waffle chicken melt, which is NOT worth getting. Most of the others are a tasty meal or two, however.  The appetizers are also super yummy. I'm not a vegetarian but since my friends were, we ordered the Wild Tofu \"Wings\". Ours were tossed in bbq and thai chili aioli. The bbq ones were awesome, and the thai ones were insanely good! Next time I go back, I'm ordering more of the thai ones for sure (and may even make a meal out of them:)) Do yourself a favor and go here, order some thai wings, get a melt, and order a seasonal beer (the Christmas ale with cinnamon and sugar was the best Christmas ale I've had), and enjoy your meal. Then, go home, relax, and put away your yummy leftovers for a midnight snack or meal the next day :D"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, would stop for beer or happy hour,  Would NEVER stop for food again.  Cold fries, sandwich OVER HYPED.... Bill came to $32. W 2 half sandwiches... .... OMG..."}
{"text":"The worst thing about this place is that I didn't discover it sooner! There are SOOOOO many awesome options that it's hard to choose. BEWARE! the portions are huge. I've personally LOVED the: Chorizo potato (9/10)  -I had to add a little Sriracha, I like it hot! Mom's meatloaf (10/10)  -I can't say enough, this thing is AMAZING Purple Parma (8/10)  -I would liked to have seen more eggplant in this one. I had one with kielbasa and saurkraut, I believe it was a special of the month that was fantastic. I highly recommend going here, unless you're on a diet or lactose intolerant. If you are, I still recommend you go, just to soak in the smells, sights and temptation!"}
{"text":"If you are craving some very unhealthy BUT amazing food, COME HERE!!!!  Not only are the Grilled Cheeses excellent but the drinks are superb too! My favorite is the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken. It's one of my favorite sandwiches of all time! In the winter they have the \"Mighty Macaroni Melt\". This is awesome too!"}
{"text":"I have been once. I ordered the grilled cheese with steak in it (don't remember the name). My steak was chewy, which made it impossible to bite down into my sandwich. Probably one of the most overrated sandwich joints out there. Paninis is better."}
{"text":"By far: my favorite restaurant in cleveland area. Maybe even anywhere! The atmosphere is very chill, beer selection is great. My only negative comment is that there is typically a long wait- but it's worth it! Try the big popper!"}
{"text":"So good! Don't get the whole sandwich unless you're planning on having leftovers! Huge portions. The hangover fries were yummy. We also had the Cleveland cheesesteak and the popper. Kids had the burger. Everyone was happy!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Cleveland and live within walking distance to Melt. It was the very first place we went when we moved in and the beer selection was much appreciated after a long day of box/furniture moving.   Melt has a great beer list. Decent sized tap list. Delicious beers. Bottle selection. Rotating seasonal taps. Good happy hour. And they have a full bar as well if beer is not your scene. Everything you could possibly want in a neighborhood bar.    Except, that this place is not open that late. The bar closes at the same time as the kitchen, 10 during the week and 11 during the weekend... Additionally, while I understand that they are going for a kitchy concept by showing cartoons or old 80s/90s movies on their numerous TVs, when we asked if they would show a particular football game on the TV we were sitting in front of, when the place was barely 1/4th full, they told us that they \"don't really do sports.\"  As for the food... I suppose for the concept that their hugely portioned various grilled cheese varieties are creative, but overall it feels super unhealthy. I really wish they had different bread options. The think cut texas butter toast, while admittedly delicious, ends up making me not only feel like I'm going to have a heart-attack after my meal, but I can barely finish half a sandwich. The best thing I've had their has been some of their seasonal vegetables. I kind of wish they would expand these side options and even offer a veggie plate combo or something.    I will be back when I want to grab a drink without going so far, but if food is in the equation, it is unlikely that this would be my first choice or recommendation."}
{"text":"I had to check out this new location of Melt on a recent trip to the Cleveland area - I'm a big fan of the other restaurants.  We were going to Lakewood for a show and figured that stopping here, before we got into the city, might mean less of a wait.  Hardly so! At 9:00 p.m. on a rainy Wednesday night, we were told that the wait for a table was an hour and a quarter for our party of two.  No worries, as the bar is large and we found a couple of stools.  Agreed - what's not to love about a 40-beer draft list and this great menu? My boyfriend, on his first visit, was stoked to find that they do vegetarian versions of many sandwiches, like The Dude Abides and the Smokey Russian (which he got and loved). I tried the Purple Parma, slightly less heart-attack-inducing than my choice last time, the (delicious) Monte Cristo.  It's true that the space just doesn't feel quite as organically kitschy as the others, though they have tried hard to replicate the experience with the plastic Santas, tin celiing and neon.  However, you've gotta give 'em credit for giving burb-dwellers a convenient alternative to Applebee's and Ruby Tuesday."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland and this place was voted best restaurant like 5 years in a row AND i saw the man vs food when he tried the melt challenge so i thought id check it out. The first night i got the blue cheese buffalo melt. I didnt really like it, there was just too much cheese. Their fries arent very good but the next time i went i tried the wake and bacon and it was awesome!!!! so cheesy and delicious!!! id deff give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Melt. It gets lots of hype locally, but truthfully I don't understand why. To be fair it is solid bar food with grilled cheese, but tons of other bars can say the same. The servers are dressed super casual, however, the service is solid and they seem to on their game. This place is worth a visit, but only if the wait is a reasonable one."}
{"text":"Second time here, this time I got the chicken and waffles, my husband had the macaroni and cheese grilled cheese, it was a fried macaroni and cheese \"patty\" and was a huge sandwich. Both were great and neither of us could finish! Wish we lived closer."}
{"text":"So happy they have even more vegan options and a specific menu so it's clear!  This location is crazy crowded in the evenings with families as well as adults. Good food. Good, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed the Summer Chicken sandwich.  My two friends had the Winter Chicken and Blackened Chicken.  All were delicious.  And ridiculous amounts of food.  And we were in and out in an hour - perfect for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars if u didn't have to wait 2 hours to get a table.  They definitely have good beer, unique sammies, and good decor.  But my theory is that since u get to get drunk while waiting for a table, it makes those sammies taste better."}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews weren't kidding- lotsa food. I ordered the Kindergartner and still couldn't finish it. Excellent beer selection with a crispy, nice cheese sandwich like I wish my mother had fixed."}
{"text":"They used to be great and it was a treat to go. Now everything comes out of a can or a bag and it's like going to Applebees. It's really a shame. They expanded just like TGI Fridays, and now I feel insulted when people come to Lakewood for Melt when there are great places with fresh, locally made food all over the city."}
{"text":"Good food, bit of a wait, but not terrible.  Plenty for of stuff on the walls to look at.  The plates are Fiesta, which is really good, but not cheap.  The sandwiches are about $10 to 15 USD. O would suggest this place to anyone in the Cleveland area.  Hoping they open one near home."}
{"text":"I've been a Melt lover for over a year now. My boyfriend and I love this place and can pretty much call it our favorite. While I haven't been to the new location yet, I can safely say that the original will be my preference for nostalgic/sentimental attachment.  The service is always fantastic here. The atmosphere is perfect. I've never had a problem. The wait staff is remarkably tolerant of giggling beer filled girls!   The menu is great and I'm always excited to try something new or to stick with what I know--never gets old. I also don't have a problem waiting and get a little frustrated with those who complain about the wait. If you're going to Melt, then you've heard about it, and if you've heard about it, you know that there WILL be a wait.   The only issue I can currently say I have is that there is no more Sunday brunch!! I cry for the apple sausage waffle!!"}
{"text":"Didn't wait long for a seat, since we opted to grab some bar stools. Guess we missed out on the cool name tags then? But I that was alright, we didn't really want to wait 45 to 50 min. We didn't wait at all, so the trade off was okay.  Our server was really nice and quick to get us menus. The menus were glued to record sleeves! Really nifty. There were SO MANY choices. I feel like maybe the whole waiting 45 minutes would have been good for contemplating which sandwich we wanted? Our server came to ask, and my boyfriend and I definitely needed more time...   We had settled on the Mushroom Melt and the Westside Monte Cristo with a glass of Stella Artois   HOLY YUMS!!!  Our sandwiches came after a considerable amount of time. A little longer than I was expecting, but the amount of food was WOAH. Coleslaw, french fires and a sandwich. So much food, a little bit too much food.   The Westside Monte Cristo I ordered was a  ton and a half of food! It was also beer batter deep fried... *drool* It also came with a mixed berry preserves sauce thing. I just dipped my sandwich in it. It was the perfect balance to the overly dense deep fried battered bread... Ahhhh... I was actually able to taste the swiss and cheddar cheese in the sandwich! I loved it. :)  The french fries were reminiscent of Five Guys and from my french fry experience I feel they were \"double dipped\" (doubly fried for added crisp!). Oh, these fries were really good!  The coleslaw is the only thing that led me to give Melt a 4/5. It was not slimy or over dressed like colesalw usually is, but it was over PEPPERED!!! It seemed like every sliver of cabbage was covered in pepper. :/  My boyfriend's mushroom melt was AMAZING... Oh, boy... I wish I had ordered that. The mushrooms were dripping with flavor, and I was dying for another bite.  The waitress/bartender was keen to ask us if we were doing alright many times. It was nice, because I was in dire need of more napkins.  TL;DR All in all I'd say a good bang for your buck! Especially if you're up for a great flavor adventure!!! Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Anyplace that not only doesn't force a vegan to create a makeshift meal but gives them many options scores points right off the bat for me. My sandwich tasted amazing & the vegan ranch was good."}
{"text":"I strongly recommend this place.  The portions are huge, the food tastes great, they have a huge beer selection and a full bar.  The staff was really nice as well.  They offer unique twists on familiar dishes that you likely won't find anywhere else.  The menu was surprisingly Vegan-friendly too if that is important to you.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"After everything I'd seen on TV, I was thoroughly amped to get a sandwich from Melt. We were with a big group, so it was easier to order by phone and go pick it up. The problem with that of course, is that the once crispy bread, and the once crispy fries turn mushy on the car ride home. I would really have loved to have it right out of the kitchen, cause I am only imagine how much better their food would've been for me.  That being said, it was still very tasty. The chicken paprikash was awesome, and should definitely be a full time menu item. I also shared half of a parmageddon, which is a brilliant idea of putting a pierogi inside of a sandwich! For carb-lovers like me, this was amazing. I loved the thick cut of the bread, and the fries were still OK because they were fresh cut.   I even re-baked half of a paprikash sandwich a few days later, and it was cripsy deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Love love love the melt, my fav food is grilled cheese so when I heard about the melt I had to go. The place is awesome, food is always good, fries are excellent but I don't like slaw so I can't say how good it is but my gf said too peppery but good. I had the tomato soup and I didn't care for it way too garlicy for me. If you haven't been here yet its a must try, if you don't like long waits come right when they open or about an hr b4 kitchen close and you will get a table."}
{"text":"Who the hell am I kidding, this place rocks, hipsters schmipsters.  It's not just for omnivores either - soy cheese and veggie patties are available for consumption for those so inclined."}
{"text":"ok So I have been to this Melt multiple times now.  The service is great the sandwiches are always good, my favorite is the Tokyo tuna melt, its delicious! perfectly cooked tuna every time.  The Monte Cristo is also decent if your looking for something on the sweet side.  I love this restaurant a lot, but I don't go that often any more because if your going to go you can't be hungry.  It's going to take about 2 hours to get a seat and another hour to get your food.  So that would be the only downfall to this place, they need to make it bigger.  Great food, Great service, and great pricing."}
{"text":"It's definitely a place one goes to as much for the experience of local color as anything else. But it's very difficult to mess up an overstuffed grilled-cheese sandwich, and brother, they do not."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this because I had seen the original location on Man vs. Food.  Boy was I disappointed as was my wife.  To say the food is disgusting doesn't even begin to describe the grease soaked POS on a plate I was served.  My wife was sick all night after eating her food.  I must have a cast iron stomach because I was fine.  Since moving to Cleveland this has been my biggest culinary disappointment.  This chain was on the wrong TV show, it should have been on Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, the place is lively, and fun.  Melt always delivers satisfaction"}
{"text":"We had to wait a while, which tells me it's popular. The staff was attentive. There was a late 20 year old with his pants down to the bottom of his ass. They should have bounced him, but no go. The food was big as  expected. You will not go hungry. I had the Paprikash sandwich. All in all a good time. Big sandwiches with their own slaw. Not bad, I like the fact there was no Mayo. I will go back."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, places like this are utter heaven! There are so many meatless options and so far they've all been delicious! My absolute favorite though, is the Tofo wings. I've never had any better anywhere, you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Melt once, but it was awesome and I do plan on going again.  I can honesty say the grilled cheese I had was the best I've ever had.   The beer selection is very good and you can find some great drafts you don't see many places.    My only contention with the place is the wait.  I can understand having to wait for a table, but it took about 40 minutes to get our food after ordering.  Let's remember this is grilled cheese not Peking duck"}
{"text":"The Melt is good. Diners, Drive ins, and Dives and Man vs. Food have provided unnecessary exposure to an already-popular restaurant. Even before the television blitz, you couldn't get a table in less than 45 minutes.  But the reason it's so popular? Everybody was shocked that an entire restaurant, based on grilled cheese, could be so good. The thick slices of texas toast house everything from Elvis-style peanut butter and bananas (with sweet cream cheese) to lasagna, to pierogies, covered in cheesy goodness and served with a bright, peppery coleslaw and piles of hand cut fries (which are great with a little malt vinegar).  I've only been a few times since it got popular, always with non-Clevelanders who are in town and want to give it a try. I personally find the sandwiches a little intimidating. Delicious and perfectly executed, but artery clogging. It makes me feel like I have to go on a strict diet of soy products and steamed vegetables for a week after eating there, in order to protect my cardiovascular system from further damage. The other issue? Melt is much better fresh. After it's cooled and congealed, it's never as good the next day. So eat up! ...Then diet the day after."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the last review I read: \"What more can be said about Melt that hasn't already been said. If you are visiting Cleveland, I would consider this place a must stop for good food before you leave.\"  The wait is long, when not there at early lunch time, but the food is well worth it if you do not mind a heart attack on a plate!  Each sandwich is a meal in an of itself, dripping with flavor and fantastic aroma, a plate full of fries and coleslaw.  I fully suggest many can share one order of sandwich and fries and do so happily.  If you truly feel up to it take the challenge as featured on Man vs Food... the Melt Challenge.  \"Our monster grilled cheese featuring 13 different cheeses, 3 slices of grilled bread and a pile of hand-cut fries & slaw.  Over 5 lbs. of food! Finish it all without any help or trips to the bathroom and you will be awarded a Melt t-shirt or Melt Pint Glass, a $10 gift card and we'll immortalize you in our online Melt Challenge Hall of Fame.\"  My favorite sandwich is the Big Popper, fresh jalapeno peppers, cheddar, herbed cream cheese, crispy battered and deep-fried, mixed berry preserves!"}
{"text":"Well I see Cleve has a bunch of crybabies, very similar to home! Your going to a place that has a lot of write up, expect a wait! Maybe service wont be quite what it is when its slow.  Food does take time to cook ya know?  They cant cook like your driving in the left lane! lot of that out here !  Comments  about McDonalds??  Dont get that one at all.  Anyway, we went it was busy, that was fine. Good beer selection. Food? I had the lasagna grilled cheese. Excellent! I had my own choice of cheeses and the soup( Buffalo chicken) was to die for. Appetizers we liked were the cheese wedges. Place was very good. We will b back."}
{"text":"Melt is not my cup of tea!  I have read quite a lot of the reviews and I wish I could say that my dining experience was as good as the majority of the reviews.  Melt has been around for some time in Mentor, but this was our first visit. The decor is very nice and clean and very upbeat.  Hardwood floors in the dining area and what looked like a high tin ceiling panels just accentuated the noise level to the point where normal conversation was a challenge.    My wife and I wanted a light dinner.  I had my heart set on the fried green tomatoes ( appetizer) but was told they either ran out or they are in the process of revising their menu as our waiter explained, but was difficult to hear exactly what he was saying.  As an alternative I chose a bowl of Buffalo Chicken Chowder.  It was the worst soup I ever tasted as the blue cheese was very predominant and overpowering along with the chili's.  I do like seasoned or moderately hot spicy dishes, but this soup was way too bold for my taste. I only ate about a quarter of the bowl. What was included was a small bag of \"goldfish\" crackers, which I thought was unusual.  I ate some of the crackers to kill the taste of the soup left in my mouth.  My wife ordered a half sandwich of the Purple Parma (Crispy Breaded Eggplant)  which was just ok, along with a side of dressed potatoes that were under done as the potatoes were still somewhat hard. If you want a quite dining experience, don't bother coming to Melt. This is a typical bar restaurant.  Our waiter was prompt at first and did explain the menu options to us, which was nice.  After we placed our order that was the last time he stopped at our table until we flagged him down for our check.  I didn't think they were that busy to warrant him not following up to see if everything was ok with our dinner."}
{"text":"A friend raved about this place, and so we went....but I wasn't too impressed. Our meal took forever and a day to arrive and when it did, my melt was all cold and congealed. Mmm, nothing like cold meat slop on bread.   My first and likely my last visit. Too bad, since the concept sounds cool and the menu was inviting."}
{"text":"i want to like you Melt, i really do.  but even with your oogey gooey sammies and tasty beer menu... i can NOT justify waiting 2.5 hours to sit down (let alone eat!)    on a few different occasions at this point, i have woefully left your premises because i was notified the wait would be upwards of an 1 and a half!  I'm sorry...  but that's just nuts."}
{"text":"That awkward moment when your \"appetizer\" of two, small pierogi costs as much as your friend's half sandwich and plate of fries.  Same goes for the ramekin of spinach dip to match the heaping plate of chips.  The cost for either was not compatible with the portion.  Seeing the receipt felt like being robbed.  The person suffering is the bartender who was tipped less, unfortunately.  Related : Why is a diet soda $3.00??  Is your profit margin so low?  Sort of related : Celery doesn't really belong in chili, but if it is, it should definitely be diced and not chopped.  Sad to put Melt on my \"overrated\" and overpriced list.  (The prices on the sandwiches is totally reasonable, of course.)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service. Who doesn't love a restaurant geared at beer and grilled cheese? 10/1 0 would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Yes, you'll wait. Boo Hoo!!!!! I can't believe the haters trashing this place. News flash: Just because this place is very trendy, and packed full of hipsters acting 15 years younger than they are Doesn't dismiss the fact that the food is AMAZING!!!!!!! Yes, service gets bogged down but, what do you expect from a place that EVERYONE is trying dine at? If you are impatient, can't wait, have somewhere else to be, or think that it resembles fast food in ANY shape, way, or form then maybe this isn't the place for you.   The Hungry Hungarian is my favorite with The Dude Abides coming in at a strong second. The portions are epic and the food is delicious. It is worth the wait...........Every time. Obviously my 8 year old doesn't like the wait so if it's bad we'll come back another time. However we have gotten in pretty quick with him a couple of times and even he likes the food. I wasn't sure he would simply because he's 8 and thinks that McDonalds is good. But to my wife's and my surprise he loved it and has asked to go back there!  Bottom line- Great food, generous portions, yes overcrowded, Definitely worth it. PS why hasn't anyone mentioned that it is very reasonably priced?"}
{"text":"Wow.  I can see why this place was featured on Food Network.  Best Monte Cristo we have ever had.  Also had \"the Dude Abides\"  (A huge breaded mozzarella wedge, meatbals and marinara).  I will warn you that unless you have a hearty appetite, a half-sandwich will do.  Great fries, but I probably only ate about five because my sandwich was huge.  Nice atmosphere, very casual and our waitress Ang was great."}
{"text":"I love the melt! We drive over 80 miles a few times a year just to get a grilled cheese here... Yes it's that good! They have tons of different type to choose from so even if you a picky eater like me you'll find something. My fave is the waking bacon and they have a huge selection of beers."}
{"text":"Very unique sandwich shop with good food and friendly staff. Good menu, wide selection of beer both draft and bottles/cans. I've been here probably fifteen times and haven't had a bad meal yet. They have seasonal special sandwiches and drink specials.. If you're in the Cleveland area you need to stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 2 stars because the review won't show up if I only give 1 star, (which is also too many.) People actually eat here?  And think it's good!?  The service was ok, but the food is terrible!  Here's a place called \"Melt,\" that specializes in grilled cheeses, and didn't even melt the cheese on my sandwich. I ordered the Jalapeño Popper sandwich.  It tasted like a pancake with bell pepper and bland gravy, (the cream cheese.). -not good. Costed about $7.  Also, If I'm going to a place that specializes in grilled cheeses, why am I going to eat a buffalo chicken sandwich, or a meatball sandwich?  I can get that anywhere.  I want a large selection of grilled cheeses.  I thought he \"Popper\" sandwich would be a grilled cheese with jalapeños- yummy. I noticed a lot of people drinking water.  I figured out why when I ordered iced tea.  It  was either the worst tea ever, or it was dish water."}
{"text":"This is why I live for Food.  Melt is my #1 restaurant of all time. Its the little things that make this place so special. The staff, the menus on record albums, the monthly specials and movie specials are by creative and magical.  Ahhh I just love it :)"}
{"text":"Heard about it and had to try.   Big portions make for an easy decision to make two meals out of the orders.  Prices were good considering the amount of food served.  We had Philly Steak sandwich, a bacon and egg grilled cheese sandwich, and mozzarella wedges. Sandwiches came with tasty and greasy fries and everything was very good. The wedges were way better than sticks most places serve you.  Service was easy to get along with and had good timing on drinks and other needs. Food took about 12 minutes to be delivered.   Didn't drink alcohol here so no comment on bar.  All in all a pretty good place. I've heard that these are a Cleveland \"institution\" which would set the bar low, but who knows. I'll just go with a cool place to eat."}
{"text":"This is a review specifically for the Lakewood location, which is the original.  First, the good: They're tasty, I'll give them that.  Healthy, not so much.  The portions are rather large, more that I can manage. For the quality of the food, I guess the price is alright.  They have a great beer selection.  The staff are adorably hipsterriffic with their tats and mods and fashion sense.  The bad: Sometimes the service is extremely slow.  Very often, the wait to get seated can be an hour and half, or more.  It takes a long time for them to make your food once you order, too.  They even expanded their Lakewood location to the adjacent storefront a few years back, yet their crowding problems didn't really improve.  The way they laid out the new half doesn't really give them much extra seating, and even when they're super busy with a long wait I often see the tables in the front of the new half unoccupied for no good reason.  I think their real problem is that their kitchen just isn't big enough to let them crank out food as fast as they need to keep up with demand.  Other locations don't seem to have this problem -- I've been to the one at Cedar and Taylor on the east side a few times and never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes to get seated.  Haven't been to the new location in Independence, and don't plan to unless I'm ever in the area.  The ugly:  When they first opened, they used to have a great music selection playing obscure but great music, underground punk and metal, as well as well-known artists (but not their greatest hits stuff that you've heard a bajillion times already because commercial FM radio sucks it hard in Cleveland).  A few years ago, someone made a decision to switch from that format to an intentionally \"ironic\" sampling of musical schlock.  It's like, \"Ha ha, we're playing that same annoying crap that WNCX and WMMS have been playing over and over for the last 40 years!\" I really wish they'd bring back the old music.  Also, the promotional tattoo thing, in my opinion, is kindof lame.  I dunno, I can understand someone getting a tattoo of a business logo that they love.  It just feels like bribery the way they promote it, not an organic grassroots kind of thing."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what the hype is about this place. I've came twice so far and it still hasn't made a huge impact on me like the rest of Cleveland. To each his own I suppose. The staff is really friendly the fries are awesome but the actual sandwiches just aren't my thing."}
{"text":"The new melt is absolutely fantastic. Wonderful atmosphere just like the old one, and now there isn't an hour long wait! Had the \"big Popper\" which is basically a sandwich-sized jalapeno Popper with cream cheese. It was fantastic although I hate how the menu doesn't tell you when its a fried sandwich.  Awesome as always."}
{"text":"Waited for about an hour for our table and then another 20 for our food. Had the westside Monte Carlo and it was amazingly good.  Very decent helping and giant portion of delicious seasoned fries.  Nap-worthy for sure!"}
{"text":"This is pig-out food; don't head to Melt if you're looking for a light (or health-conscious) meal. Messy, chaotic, creative and delicious. Portions are more than enough for the general human. Have had several different sandwiches and every single one of them has been amazing, and reasonably unhealthy."}
{"text":"Don't even bother to try to go to the Melt in Lakewood.  There is NEVER less than an hour wait and there is nowhere to park.  I like their food, but the location, parking and ridiculous wait time ruins the experience."}
{"text":"Great service,  excellent Bloody Mary's and cardiac food! So worth it! The one thing I was looking forward to coming all the way from Oregon."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is great.    However, the service leaves something to be desired.  The day I went we had an hour wait, which is fine with me for great food, but to see employees not working as a team was disappointing.  There was one very nice employee who was doing it all he was clearing tables taking orders bringing out food and just being a workhorse.  Yet, one guy can't do it all.  Thus, dirty tables were sitting empty while hungry customers sat looking at the dirty tables.  Two male employees sat behind the counter looking too cool to work while one guy and a couple waitresses made it work dysfunctionaly. I think some employees need a kick in the pants and reminded customer service is king and the more tables u turn the more money that's in ur pocket.  Hire folks that want to be in the food industry not cronies with tattoos just trying to be associated with a cool brand, they'll ruin the business.  Added pic"}
{"text":"Everything about Melt is awesome. The food is amazing. The waitstaff is great. The monthly specials are to die for. The only think you can complain about is the wait, and that is just the sign of a delicious restaurant. A must visit if you come to the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong here. It's exactly as advertised. I went for a huge sandwich, and delivered a huge sandwich was. I made my own and really enjoyed it. It takes a real fatty to clean the plate here. I ate half of the sandwich, didn't touch the cole slaw, and shared the fries. I was full just looking at the sandwiches leaving the window. That monte cristo looks like a challenge I'd like to take on at some point.  The other half of my sandwich and the cole slaw worked out just fine for dinner the next day. Smoked turkey, avacado, 10 slices of bacon, pepper jack, chipotle mayo."}
{"text":"Out of a party of 6, I was the only one mildly happy with the food.  The service is very slow, but we'd heard that before hand and expected it.  I sandwich, the Monte Cristo, was okay but not good enough that I'll go back.  One member of the party got food poisoning, and two others didn't feel that swell.  The other two didn't even eat their sandwiches, they only liked the fries. If you go, expect to spend around 2 hours, waiting for a table and the slow staff."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the infamous melt. Had something with fish in it...pretty delicious. I thought it was a bit greasy bit I guess that's the nature of it. Drinks were great...good service."}
{"text":"Not impressed and don't get the hype really. Cool place to go if you are looking for the kinda touristy, Hard Rock Cafe kinda vibe. Food is NOT anything special. It's original (ish) and all but it's NOT that good. I'm pretty easy to please but I don;t see waiting in line for it or being creeped out being inches from anyone else in the joint. I like my space when dining and this location does not offer that. The new joint in Coventry does a better job at this though...."}
{"text":"i am a Jersey native, and boy do i wish one of these came to jersey! I suggest getting a half because these sandwhiches are so damn big, and full of carbs! i was instantly falling asleep half way through. the perrogi app was a rip off so stay away from it, but their sandwhiches are amazing and i suggest getting the mac n cheese one...oh lord was it good!  Now, i only gave 3 stars because the service sucks. Sorry, had to say it. there were plenty of empty tables and we were still waiting 20 mins for a table, and  we were a group of 2. then it took awhile to get things, and receive orders. the table next to us were already seated when we walked in, we were receiving our sandwhiches and they didnt even receive their appetizers.  also they dont open until 4 pm, and it already had people in there by about 410 pm , people deff dont wait to come here."}
{"text":"I lived and ate in Cleveland for nearly 30 years before moving out of state. Of all the food I've eaten in CLE, Melt is the one that I miss most of all. I haven't had a Melt sandwich for over two years and decided to remedy that on our most recent visit home. Oh Melt, how I have missed you!  If you have never been here, the portions are huge! Given the large portions, my fiancée and I decided to split a sandwich instead of each committing to our own. I am a sucker for specials, so I convinced her to join me in splitting the General Tso's Delicious Manchu Dynasty Melt. The sandwich was comprised of Crispy Fried Chicken slathered in General Tso's Sauce, Crisp Broccoli Egg Foo Young, Rangoon Style Cream Cheese, Muenster Cheese, and a Sesame Seed Garnish. I would give this sandwich 3.5 starts. Overall, it was good, but the Egg Foo Young was bland and seemed pointless. I think it would have been better without it unless they add some more flavor to the egg. Next time, I will get my old stand-by the Big Popper. Needless to say, I have no choice but to go back to truly satiate my craving.  We finished with the Fried Twinkies. I had never had a fried Twinkie before. I must admit that, while it was good, it was not the amazing dessert I was expecting. I think I will stick with the bread pudding.  Melt is such a staple in the Cleveland community that you almost need to visit when in the area, but I do miss the days where Lakewood was the only location. The more locations they build, the more it looses its identity."}
{"text":"My first visit to Melt didn't impress me in the least. My friend and I waited thirty five minutes and then another twenty five for our food. Don't get me wrong our grilled garlic portabella  mushroom was awesome, but the wait was a real turn off. My daughter is in from California and the one place she missed in Cleveland was Melt Bar and Grilled. She was craving the Smokey Russian so I decided to give it another try, but to be honest I was not looking forward to the wait. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was no wait and we were served pretty fast. The food and the waiter were both really good. The trick is to not visit on holidays or when kids are out of school. I also think that sharing is a really good idea."}
{"text":"Great food, Great atmosphere , i have seen the place on many tv shows, i spend to much time chasing food from the tv shows lol, however this one was well worth it, my wife and i took a 1400 mile tour on our motorcycle in the state of ohio with many places we had to check off our bucket list, this one was great , food was very large portions and very reasonably priced , Melt was the bomb !!!!!!!!!! we will be back for sure and i hope they head north to cincinnati!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here with while visiting my cousin in Cleveland. The portions are HUGE.  I enjoyed th atmosphere and the food! All in all it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I go to Melt almost every time I go to Cleveland and this weekend was no exception! Just when you think you can't stuff something between two pieces of toast and cheese... Melt does! They have so many combinations of grilled cheeses, or you can customize your own. I was boring yesterday and just got grilled cheese with muenster cheese. My boyfriend got one that had fried chicken, potato hash, ham, and different kinds of cheeses. My one friend got a chicken and waffle grilled cheese.. Complete with maple syrup for dipping. And my other friend customized her grilled cheese with a bunch of different veggies! They do have a full bar with a ton of beer, but we didn't get any. If you're in Cleveland, you have to check out Melt!"}
{"text":"I ate at the location in Independence. It was a Wednesday night and the place was full, with a waitlist. Grabbed a seat at the long bar that runs almost diagonally through the strip mall space. Good energy. Interesting, if strange decor. Not enough TV's (the part of the bar I ate at you couldn't really see the monitor. I had the Korean roast pork sandwich and instead of fries I ordered the tomato soup (very good - sent back to come out hot - with basil. Hearty.). Korean pork was fantastic. This place would get 4 stars if it offered more of the creations as half-portions. The portions are \"Man vs. Food\" size and I get it, it's sort of their claim to fame if you will - but a full size sandwich has to have 2000 calories and 75 grams of fat. A belly buster. No one should come here expecting the tilt to be lighter, healthier fare, but at the same time if you're dining alone, which I was, coming to Ohio for business, you will likely leave a bunch of the sandwich over. Overall I enjoyed it and would come back - with a friend."}
{"text":"Okay, I have to admit I am a fan.  But, let me caveat by saying, 1) it is close, 2) it has a pretty good vibe an atmosphere and 3) the service has always been pretty good.  So is the food 'great'?  No, but it is pretty good and it is very creative.  I especially enjoy when they bring the burgers back into play.  This is also a place you can take people from out of town and freak them out with the size of the portions.  So there is always fun in that."}
{"text":"Not sure why I haven't rated this one, yet. Ive eaten here  what feels like a dozen times since I moved here last summer. I almost always do pick up because it gets a little too crowded to eat in. They always have my food ready when they say they will, though, and it's always great. I'm partial to the Dude Abides and the Parma, Italia."}
{"text":"Great food and fun atmosphere. Great place to dine with kids and accommodates all dietary requests. Good beer list!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Stopped here over the weekend on a trip from Pittsburgh because we have heard how good the food is! We were more than pleased with the service and delicious heaping plates that my hubby and I received. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Tried the tofu wings with the spicy buffalo sauce which were as non spicy as anything gets...the godfather sandwich, where the lasagna did not taste good in the sandwich and the waitress tried everything she could to get us out of there..never seen a waitress pick up the check before the customer leaves before this one..I just felt that was outright rude..."}
{"text":"Melt is just stupid!  Their ridiculously huge and awesome sandwich creations are stupid!  Their great beer selection or drink menu is just stupid!  And the reason they are stupid is because I live all the way in LA and I have no idea when I'll be able to have them again.    Right before I flew home, a large amount of locals said I had to try Melt, so I stopped in.... Place was PACKED, so I sat at the bar, was greeted quickly, and was given some recommendations per their crazy sandwich menu.... I couldnt choose on my own because everywhere around me was a different amazing looking sandwich....   Buffalo Chicken Soup!!! I regret not buying 3 bowls to go for the plane ride home... One of the best soups I've had in a really long time.    Chorizo & Potato sandwich!! so damn good... Per the barman's rec, I added fried eggs and sliced jalapenos.... made for a perfect sandwich...   I brought most of the sandwich with me on the plane and it made the 5hr flight home sooooo enjoyable!"}
{"text":"You can have it good, fast or cheap...pick one.  The food here is good....real good. But expect a wait for the gourmet re-imagined grill cheese. So many wonderfully imaginative sandwiches, other terrific items, and a great beer list. Friendly and attentive staff. But surely not fast food, although worth the wait."}
{"text":"STILL 5 stars.  I try and go here every time I come home (about every 3-4 months), and Melt never disappoints.  So far, I've had the following sandwiches - ranked in order from best to just ok, because I've yet to have a bad sandwich:  1)  Mushroom Melt - I'm not vegetarian, but this is just a solid sandwich.  If you don't like mushrooms I feel sorry for you. 2)  Big Popper - as a general rule, I'd get jalapeno poppers as an app, but something about throwing them between even more cheese in a sandwich makes them amazing. 3)  Northcoast Shores - inexpensive crabcakes, and you get your veggies. 4)  Parmageddon - because Parma is full of Poles, this sandwich is full of pierogi.  And kraut.  What's not to love? 5)  Purple Parma - Odd that I put the two Parmas together, but this is the veggie one to get if you don't like mushrooms.  And if you don't like mushrooms or eggplant, perhaps you should rethink the whole vegetarian thing, eh? 6)  Lake Erie Monster - I grew up near the lake, so I do sort of wish this were perch instead, but walleye'll do.  And the jalapeno tartar sauce adds a nice kick. 7)  Municipal Stadium Magic - nostalgia aside, who doesn't love brats?  And again with the kraut... Mr. Fish knows the way to my heart. 8)  Tokyo Tuna Melt - something different here, with tuna steak and wasabi.  The lettuce holds up a little meh, but you've still got that wasabi! 9)  Hot Italian - kind of like a pizza grilled cheese.  Who doesn't like pizza?? 10)  Smokey Russian - just the way I like my Russians.  No vodka here, but... wait - kraut!! 11)  Westside Monte Cristo - this is only at the bottom of my list because it's almost too much - batter and preserves?  You've gotta be a glutton for punishment to get this one.  Tasty punishment.  So there it is, apparently I've been to Melt at least 11 times despite living in Chicago.  In case Matt Fish reads these - once you get the East Side location going, if you're interested in a Chicago location... call me!"}
{"text":"Expect to wait a while.  My food is always VERY greasy, but good.  The cole slaw has too much pepper and not my flavor and the fries are over seasoned. I have been here a few times and it is 50/50 with the servers. Some of them are great and others are just horriable. The tables are also pretty much on top of one another. Hope you don't mind eating with strangers. Your best bet is to get pick up. It will save you time, and you won't have to deal with the servers."}
{"text":"Everything we had was great!  Couldn't finish a half sandwich.  My blt was so flavorful!  Had it with vegan bacon."}
{"text":"The service and food were \"okay\". Meaning it wasn't jaw dropping amazing nor was it dreadful. It satisfied our hunger.  We ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich to share. The portions were great in that two of us could share the sandwich and be satisfied (not completely full, but enough to not need to eat for a few hours). I did not find anything special with the sandwich other than the size and the novelty of being deep fried.  It was a busy place and had a fun atmosphere. It seems to be a good location for groups to enjoy and have a relaxed time."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly , melted cheese sandwich had a single slice of cheese with lots of bread , better bet is to double up on cheese if you order this , could not eat the tomato soap as it was way to salty , first time here so more than Likely ordered the wrong food as the other reviews are more positive. Would not try this place again"}
{"text":"Revised and updated menu.  At least the menu includes small plate salads and new appetizers.  There are also lots of \"add-ons\" to choose from.  Personally, I think Melt is just okay.  If huge portions are your thing then you will dig it.  I'm not into that.  I think there are way better places to eat."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars? Because it's an experience, but I might be too old for it.     ---   ---   ---  Something has happened in the last couple of years: my stomach just can't handle a ton of fried food anymore. I used to be able to consume an unlimited amount without repercussion. Now there's oh, so much repercussion.  My previous visit to Melt was only 2-3 years ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. But this go-around, my body punished me for eating half of a sandwich.  My recommendation for people visiting Cleveland: order 1 grilled cheese per 2 people. Don't feel like less of a man (or woman) for not being able to finish even half, especially if you've surpassed your 30th birthday.   If you're reading this, and regularly put down an entire Monte Cristo by yourself... then you're a real hero and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."}
{"text":"Been to the other locations and this one is the best so far. The portions are really big, I only have to order a half sandwich to fill me up. The food was soooo good. I definitely recommend the Mac and cheese sandwich. Every time I've gone to this location I've had great service and I would definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan but was a tad disappointed.....still giving it 4 stars but some things they should know...if they read posted reviews.  The location is nice, a lovely upscale part of Cleveland. I was visiting with some friends and after a full day at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame we were famished and ready so Melt seemed like a great place for a unique enjoyable tasty and memorable meal.   I had seen Melt reviewed many years ago on Man Versus Food and wanted to visit for a long time. The moment we got there were excited as the setting is super cool, the decor is awesome. Retro, unique, authentic, tasteful, and whimsical just plain fun!!!  We got seated rather quickly but then we had to wait.......honestly......45 minutes from the time they seated us until our meals eventually arrive. This is just too much and to make matters more frustrating our waitress didnt seem fazed by this at all. No apology, no manager came over to address the situation nothing. I was let down. In the very least she could've told us the kitchen was backed up and suggested quick appetizers like fries or something to tie us over. Just no real thought or concern on this point.   Our sandwiches were memorable and the price was right. In the end it was a great meal for sure and all 4 of us were happy. I dont come to Cleveland oftern (likely not again for a very very long time) but I can recommend Melt. My only tip is that you ask the waitress how long the kitchen is backed up so you can possibly get some quick apps on the table."}
{"text":"I thought I knew what a grilled cheese was...Boy was I WRONG! This place has blown my mind! Who would have thought to put Chroizo, potatoes, a fried egg, and cheddar cheese in one sandwich....WOW. AND! They have a great beer list and bartender was well versed in the in's and out's of the entire selection."}
{"text":"Never eaten at Melt. What a destination! Lives up to the hype, at least with the sandwiches. Ordered the Monte Christo and the Gyro. The MC was excellent! Those preserves just made it \"to die for\". The Gyro was good, not great. I prefer the trad pita. But the slaw was worthless and way too many fries."}
{"text":"Monte crisco was amazing food was crazy good fries are perfect first time there good sandwiches"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! So many varieties of sandwiches. The waiter was extremely helpful in deciding what to get. Great kids menu too. Sooo much food to eat, you will surely have leftovers."}
{"text":"This Melt location has quickly become my favorite, based on wait-time (at most 10 minutes of about 10 visits so far) and parking (never an issue). I usually order the Kindergarten with yellow cheese and seitan bacon, but really like the Purple Parma, too. I always order the tofu \"wings\", too and like both the Buffalo and BBQ versions. The beer selection is always awesome. There's usually a bit longer wait here than fast-casual restaurants, but diners should remember this food isn't just microwaved. Only bad experience I had involved a server not being upfront about discounts that were advertised and we asked about and were misled. Otherwise, all of the other experiences have been perfect and I always bring my friends from out of town to this awesome Cleveland original."}
{"text":"After seeing an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was filmed at Melt, I knew I had to visit. We came up to Cleveland from Dallas to visit some friends, and the only thing I told them we had to do was visit Melt. The atmosphere was very eclectic and fun. I loved the video game headers on the beer fridges behind the bar.  We each ordered a different sandwich, and they were awesome! We had a Monte Cristo, a chorizo & potato, The Dude Abides, and the Cleveland Cheese Steak. All of them were super yummy! The Monte Cristo absolutely rocked! It was by far my favorite sandwich.  The food was delicious, obviously, and the staff was super friendly and helpful. This is definitely a place we will come back to when we are back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner with my family. We ordered the hangover fries as an appetizer and our separate melts for dinner. I will start by saying the melts were fantastic as always! I personally had the Parma, Italy and it was great.  The fries we ordered though had a thick black hair cooked into the egg. We let our waitress know and she took it away and she was very apologetic!   Overall: excellent place to eat!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is somewhat kitschy.    Yes, you will be forced to wait (for seating) for up to an hour in what appears to be a lobby/seating area that wasn't so much \"lacking a plan\" as \"just plain poorly planned\".  No, you probably won't find a spot at the bar...it's also packed.  No, you cannot find another sandwich like this anywhere in America, yet.  And that's the rub.    This place is truly fantastic.  Their grilled cheese sandwiches are a revelation.  You can order off of the menu or sub items to customize your dream comfort food.  They come with the option of handcut fries, a green salad, or a chunky tomato soup.  In addition, you're given a pickle and vinegar slaw.  If you're the kind of person who feels so inclined...you can finish your meal with a fried twinkie...how very Kentucky of them...?  The beer selection is ample and geared towards the regional \"indie kid\" microbrew favorites.  Speaking of indie kids...they are the waitstaff.  Extra special bonus?  The menu is pasted to a backing made from LP covers.  Most of which seem to be Iron Maiden...I've never seen so many Iron Maiden album covers in one place...seriously."}
{"text":"Woohoo!!  Two dishes for the price of one!  Oh, that's just one?  Holy GIANT sandwich, people!  I went here for the first time for lunch one day on my own and sat at the bar.   I had a great view of the kitchen and quickly realized that these people were serious about contributing to the obesity epidemic.  I immediately wished my husband was there to enjoy the other half of my trough as I knew it was going to be way too much.    I enjoyed the special - a falafel sandwich!  It was amazing, the perfect combo of flavors and textures and I enjoyed it immensely (my waist line - not so much).  The fries were great and even the coleslaw was fab.     The service went above and beyond - literally - with both girls working the bar constantly asking me if I needed anything.      I didn't feel uncomfortable or bored there alone and I really enjoyed the other half of my lunch (I swear the to-go box weighed three pounds) later in the day.    I can't wait to take my husband here and split a plate!"}
{"text":"Gross.  No idea how anyone likes this slop.  Bread is all soggy and way way way too big.  Everything we tried was kind of tasteless and just weird.  Meatballs are horrible.  side salad was a joke...I felt like I was eating weeds. And...the bill was over $70.  I don't get it.  Are people in cleveland clueless about what a good sandwich is?"}
{"text":"Noisy, loud and really greasy. Call your cariologist when you leave..."}
{"text":"I'm glad this location opened up because the one in Cleveland was impossible to get into with such a long wait. We got seated and served really fast here. I can't remember what sandwich I had but it was great. They have so many different choices and variety of combination for your sandwich. The serving was huge and after leaving I said I wished they had a half size option and was told they do by someone who went there with me. I haven't verified that but if they do that is great. The waiter we had was very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. I'm marking down one star because the people I was with kept ordering beer and they didn't have it. Maybe they should work out a system to better list the beer that is in stock:)"}
{"text":"We just left melt after a great Father's Day meal! Vinny was so enthusiastic and wonderful, you could tell he loves his job. It really made the experience that much better. He also makes the best long islands around! Sandwiches were delicious! Can't wait to eat them for left overs!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food and an awesome beer selection. Personally I like the \"smoky Russian\" but I doubt you would go wrong with any sandwich. They give huge portions and you won't walk away hungry. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in all of Cleve.  They have great sandwiches and a great Sunday brunch.  All are not very healthy, but it's a huge grilled cheese so you get what you expect.  Portions are plenty to fill you up, and there are vegan options available for most sandwiches.  The veggies they have as substitutes are usually coated in some kind of sauce which can make them a little less healthy, but still tasty.  All of the staff is helpful, just be prepared to wait to get seated and to wait a while for your food as this is one of their smallest locations (the original).  Overall great place, if you've got time to kill and are super hungry this is one of the best spots in Cleve.  side note: their take out is just as good as it is in the restaurant as long as you don't have to drive too far.  The bread will get soggy depending on how far you drive."}
{"text":"Come hungry!! We arrived around 2:30 on a Saturday and had to wait a few minutes but- no complaints the food was definitely worth it!! We couldn't make up our mind so we started with an appetizer then ordered half sandwiches as our server informed us a full is rather large. I'm so glad she told us that or we would have had a ton of leftovers.  We ordered a Parma, Italy and Chicken and Waffles.  Best part you can change the sandwich up or create a one however you wish!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Melt locations in Cleveland. When going to Melt especially on the weekend expect to wait a while. Typically I get take out from here because its quicker but I have eaten in and had a wonderful experience. I have never had a bad waiter or waitress and the entire staff is very friendly. The food is delicious and they give you more food than expected. I LOVE Melt and everyone should try this palce at least once!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!    All of the sandwiches I've eaten here have always been awesome!  The Chorizo & Potato is even greater when you add a fried egg and fresh Jalapenos.  Two others favs are the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken and The Godfather.  Definetly not a place to go if you are counting calories, but a great place to splurge!   Seriously, run don't walk to your nearest Melt!"}
{"text":"WARNING! Do not come if you're wearing white or don't want to get your hands dirty! Came here with a group of friends and let me just say - this is one of the best casual bars I've ever been to that serve absolutely amazing food. They're best known for their grilled cheeses, but they also have an additional menu for those who don't want one of their sandwiches. What I liked the most is that if there was something you didn't like (for example, you wanted American cheese instead of mozzarella), they'll let you sub for it without an additional cost. Something else that appealed to me was that they offered a vegan option! They do have vegan grilled \"cheeses,\" but there are labels on the side of the menu that tell you whether or not they can make it vegan. Once we ordered, it only took not even 10 minutes to get our food. Let me tell you - it was mouthwatering, savory, and filling. There's an option to get a half or full sandwich, but I ended up getting a full one so I can bring it hope. This isn't a place where you spend a lot of money and get a little - it's quite the opposite. You pay a little and get a LOT of food. If I'm ever back in Cleveland, would love to come back here!"}
{"text":"The infamous melt bar in Cleveland heights Ohio ... It's a bucket list item just for the fact that in 2009 man against food won the crown for eating an exorbitant amount of food on the food network !  This place has a huge wrap around bar with tons of draft beers on tap and grilled cheese anyway you like it... Like I mean anyway you like it... They organize the menu by veg, poultry, beef, fish, and just cheese!  Cool laid back atmosphere with tattoos and flannels, there is no lack of culture splashed on the walls! It's fun for you, a couple or bring the whole fam. Just keep in mind the food is huuuuuge so you can share! Cheers"}
{"text":"I really like the bar here. Their cocktails are fabulous. I also enjoy the buffalo chicken chowder (comes with goldfish!) and their versions of poutine. The salads are ok but they suffer from the same dilemma as the sandwiches, which brings me to my confession: I don't like their sandwiches! It's not that they're bad, necessarily, it's just the whole \"here's a shit-ton of food piled up look how big it is!\" thing. I'd rather have a grilled cheese in which each ingredient was equally important and meant to be tasted. The bread is also on the too-thick side here, it can cut up the roof of your mouth if you're not careful. But the concept is still cool and worth trying, it might be more your thing than it is mine!"}
{"text":"Such a unique restaurant all the way from the menu to the decor! I love the Cleveland Cheesesteak and the Hangover Fries! They also have this delicious blueberry lemonade cocktails! It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Melt is the best restaurant we have eaten at since we have been in Ohio. The ambiance is loud, but a really cool place. They have tons of stuff to look at on the walls and such. The menu is incredible. Every combination of grilled cheese you can think of.   We started out with the Hangover fries. JESUS. This was the best appetizer I have ever had. fries with gravy, fried pork belly, green onions, cheese curd and a fried egg. They were so ridiculously delicious. Its a meal in itself.   My husband got the full Monte Cristo. It was HUGE. And delicious! I got the Korean War Pig. Holy moly. A half was almost too much. The flavors were definitely not lacking here. These sandwiches are definitely Los Angeles worthy. I miss the food back home because everything here is so flavorless. NOT HERE. Melt is amazing."}
{"text":"First timer at Melt and was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately came away completely underwhelmed. There was a 15 minute wait despite numerous open tables and service was painfully slow. The Cleveland Cheesesteak sandwich was decent but the sandwich and fries came out lukewarm. The quality didn't live up to the hype or the expensive prices. Perhaps it's just that this location has issues, as other people have noted slow service and cold food. But as of now I can't reach any conclusion other than that Melt is overrated."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! I was skeptical when my husband suggested grilled cheese for dinner, but it was so good and worth it! Our waitress was attentive as were all the waiters/waitresses, working as a team to get everyone served and taken care of. I had the bushwood club and it was excellent, wouldn't change a thing! Highly recommend for environment and awesome food!"}
{"text":"As guests, any inconvenience we encountered was promptly eclipsed by an accommodating staff and unique setting.  At 2:30 pm, the wait was two and a half hours long! You should either (a) plan for this ahead of time, even if you think you're going during off hours. The host offered to text us when our turn was coming up. Or, (b) check the bar for seating. After hearing about the horrendous wait, I immediately found two seats at the bar. Score!  Our orders took over an hour to materialize in front of us. The bartender, despite being absolutely SWAMPED, took note and wanted to make it up to us, even though we were not complaining in the least. We'd already had a couple of beers, but he offered us a round on the house. When I ordered an inexpensive brew, he said \"well, if it is going to be on me, let me at least choose your beer.\" He chose the Japanese Hitachino White Ale. OMG. Best beer EVAR. It tasted light and summery, but still had enough spice and flavor. I noticed later that this was one of the more expensive beverages on the menu. Totally worth it (but then again, it was free for me!).  I ordered the Smoky Russian. Yum, yum. My companion ordered the Monte Cristo. Mine was good, but his was better. I ate his leftovers the next day.  Oh, and you WILL have leftovers. GIANT portions.   And lastly... the decorations in this place are super weird. But that's fun."}
{"text":"Makes my gall bladder hurt!  Too much grease and fried food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good but I'd maybe heard too much about what a fan-flippin-tabulous place it is, because I was a little underwhelmed. First off, we were told there'd be a half hour wait and we waited at least an hour. Once we got it, service was prompt and cheerful. My Bloody Mary was gross. Served with a sweet pickle chip and all of 2 green olives, it was a sad excuse for a Bloody Mary. They need to run their sauce through a blender because there were large chunks of herb-twigs that got stuck in my teeth. They exchanged it without a hassle but the point is that I've had a better Bloody Mary on a plane. Appetizer was fried green tomatoes, which I normally love. In this case, I wasn't crazy about the breading. For my sandwich, I got the Rising Sun, an Asian style shrimp sandwich. That was great - thick, delicious bread and fat shrimp. That made me happy. On the whole, the place was pretty good, but not worth an hour wait."}
{"text":"CHEESE! so much cheese.  i loved everything about this place.  Firstly, the place was really decorated so cool.  and the waiter that we had was so awesome and helpful.  This is a really cool idea for a restaurant.  I was looking forward to getting the jalepeno grilled cheese.  it was absolutely delicious and was a monster of a sandwich.  (i added pepper jack cheese to the sanwich as well)  The waiter suggested that I add bacon to the grilled cheese.  I wish i did that because i feel like it needed a little bit more substance for such a huge sandwich.  all in all it was a great meal.  their fries were probably my most favorite fries i have had.  However, the only thing I would have changed about the sandwich besides adding the bacon to it ... after a while the deep fried grilled cheese got to be too much.  Me and my boyfriend wish that before ordering we got one deep fried grilled cheese and one regular grilled cheese.  I would totally go back and try another grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"Found this place thru Yelp and went prior to a show on a Sunday evening.   There was an hour wait, but luckily we got two seats at the bar.  The beer selection was amazing and I was able to get my favorite beer, Delerium Tremens.  The food was great too.  I had the fat city burger which is my new favorite and my wife had the mushroom burger.  We both loved it although she could have done with less pepper on everything.   Atmosphere was cool and very relaxing."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Melt for lunch.  Got a cold beer (much needed after a long drive) and had a grilled cheese with chorizo, hash browns, a fried egg and a side of sliced jalapeno.  It was a BIG sandwich and it hit all the right notes.  Not the lightest meal, but oh so good.  Fries were good too.  Nicely seasoned and well cooked.  A fun place."}
{"text":"What isn't there to love about this place. There's a beer list so long it takes up mutliple pages of the menu. The staff is awesome and very knowledgeable on both the food and drinks. And then there's the giant selection of different sandwiches. I had the special which was a Prime Beef sandwich with horseradish and mashed potatoes on it, along with a side of au jus to dip in. Yes, it was amazing. I had samples of the crab cake one, the perogi one, and the chicken parmesean one which all tasted amazing. I was so stuffed on the sandwich I barely ate any of the fries or the cole slaw, so I can't comment on those. I'm def looking to go back here anytime I'm back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. GREAT energy vibe as soon as you walk in the door, friendly staff, delicious aromas, indulgent variety of beers and menu selections to please everyone. We had a wonderful experience sitting at the bar eating. We loved our drink,  food & service. The layout of the place was open and inviting. I am super stoked to find out Melt is coming to CBus in the Short North....can't wait!"}
{"text":"My 10 closest friends and I placed a 15 sandwich order one glorious Saturday afternoon. We have a very complicated system where trading sandwich halves and bites is involved so we can try the most amount of Melt fare possible.   Within my bartering process, I was able to snag half of gyro, half a mushroom, and a few bites of the Chicken Paprikash & Parmageddon. The gyro was my favorite, but I'm certain that all of them have lessened my life span by a few hours...but they were worth it!   I ended up having to save some of my sandwich for later, which I broiled in the oven. I should have done this when the take out arrived. It was about a 20 minute drive after they picked up the sandwiches, so they got a little soggy. I'm glad we did this rather than wait in a 1.5 hour line!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.....the wait time is just terrible...2 hours? Food was ok, but nothing I should be waiting for over 2 hrs to get. Waitress was very nice but you might need your earplugs in there cause it gets loud,"}
{"text":"Great food was very tasty the melt if the month is great always never been disappointed.  Also I always like eating their dessert of the month it is a full meal but usually very over the top and kind of crazy"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place! I DO feel it is overrated, but it was good. Also, I don't see how anyone could have an entire sandwich to themselves. One half is a sandwich itself!!!! On this visit we had the BLACKENED CHICKEN SALAD: veeeeeery good, definitely the best thing we ordered. HOT ITALIAN: it was good but felt like it barely had any meat which shouldn't be the case with this sandwich.  BUFFALO CHICKEN SOUP: it was really good as well, but if you're not of fan of celery(which I'm not) then do not get it SPIN/ARTICHOKE DIP: okay, least fav thing, says creamy but our was cold and chunky. Also, HUGE pieces of artichoke. Overall, I was satisfied and food was good, but I feel it os overrated."}
{"text":"My friend and I had such high hopes when we went in. 4 stars on yelp, thoughts of melty sandwich goodness. How can anyone say no to that? Overall, it was just the food we were unimpressed by. The restaurant is a large sports bar like  restaurant with a bunch of crazy decorations. Fun! We went in right before the lunch rush and were seated promptly. Service was ok. The menu has a lot of choices and if you feel like you can't eat a whole sandwich, you can get half. Prices are very reasonable.  I got the Lake Erie monster (fried fish with slaw and jalapeño tarter sauce) with fries and slaw. My friend got the Kindergarten (basically a plain grilled cheese) with fries and the buffalo chicken chowder. The fish in my Lake Erie was lackluster, sort of like the fried fish fillets from the frozen section. If the bread was normal sized, it would look pretty plain. The slaw helped cut through the heaviness of the meal, though it was plain tasting. My friend like his buffalo chicken chowder. Very cute that they used goldfish crackers. However, he didn't even like his Kindergarten, which is just a basic grilled cheese.  Overall, it wasn't the melty goodness we were expecting. The bread is very hard and large and the cheese seems to be premelted onto the bread, so it wasn't even gooey. The biggest offender though? The fries sucked! How can you mess up on fries? They looked so good but tasted so stale. The fact that the food wasn't good even before the lunch rush makes me not want to come here again."}
{"text":"Another meh, over-hyped place. 3 stars is based on my experience but I've only been to Melt once during my visit to Cleveland so maybe it needs another chance? I say meh because really it's just the portions that make the sandwiches stand out. We split the big popper sandwich and a hangover fries between 3 people and were stuffed....so I'd definitely recommend sharing. Taste was average only. I can honestly make a better grilled cheese. It's mostly deep-fried bread and not a lot of actual stuffing...but then again maybe it was the sandwich we ordered....though the big popper came very highly recommended by locals and our waiter. Also the fries were soggy and not worth $10!  Had high hopes for this place but it was probably the worst meal we had in Cleveland. Not sure if I would give it a second chance. I'd much rather go to the West Side Market and get a $6 falafel or $8 gyro."}
{"text":"The thing I love about coming here is the lively atmosphere. If you're going there to partake their expansive beer selection, you won't be disappointed.  And if you're into greasy (cheesy) sandwiches, you've found your place. One issue is that it takes a while to get them. Grilled cheese sandwiches that take 45min to 1hr to get every time I've been there. This is unreasonable for a kitchen this large. Another is that the bread much thicker than it needs to be. Sandwiches are serviceable, but not worth such a long wait. Appetizers offerings are also below average as a whole.   Cool place, and somewhere I'd come to once a year, usually to take out-of-towners."}
{"text":"I went there to show off one of Cleveland's unique restaurants to out of town guests and we were deeply disappointed!    We orders Mom's Meatloaf and it was hideous and expensive!  The Bad:  -Big bread that was too thick! -small meat loaf that was dry, tough, room temperature, tasteless and small portion. (The meat loaf was thinner than one slice of bread) -mashed potatoes that were cold/room temperature  -$14 was way overpriced!  The Good: - great beer selection.   Suggestion to them: -Make the meat loaf more tender, serve at a hot temperature, larger size by making it wider and thicker! -keep a more strict eye on temperature as this is a major health concern.   -cut down on the thickness of the bread a bit.   Maybe we ordered the wrong sandwich, maybe this restaurant lacks the original Lakewood restaurant standards, but this experience was terrible.  No wonder why the restaurant was slow...a bad sign."}
{"text":"I stopped in to place a takeout order while my car was being worked on across the street.  Had just enough time for a beer while the order was being prepared.  Ambiance is casual and cool, many tacky plastic lawn ornaments (think Santa, Snowman, Jack O Lanterns, etc) and oversized vintage signs give this the cool, funky vibe it seeks.  It seems small though, I can see very long waits on weekend nights.  The Monte Cristo melt was great, enough for two meals and I am a big eater.  My wife had the eggplant melt and she enjoyed that as well.  Great beer selection, this would be a good place just to go for a drink too."}
{"text":"i've put off going to Melt for at least a couple years now. in truth I tried to go (before meeting Danielle) with coworkers when i worked for \"AT&T\" but the wait at the Lakewood location was near 2 hours so we went to Winking Lizard instead.  anyway, since meeting Danielle she's wanted to go and I'd lost interest - wasn't particularly excited about paying so much for \"just a grilled cheese\" and that was basically my mistake. i thought of it as \"just grilled cheese\". so, when we went to Melt on Sunday for the first time you might imagine my surprise to find out this was not \"just grilled cheese.\" in fact, as I just mistyped, this is more like \"frilled cheese\".   Elliot, our server, was a nice enough chap and basically did just enough to get a near 20% tip - which i'll give to nearly any server who does the near basic work. i could have used a couple more check ins to find out if we needed drink refills or whatever but, all in all, it was fine.  Let's talk about my sandwich though. I ordered the Cleveland Cheese Steak. Unlike other cheese steak sandwiches made with sliced rib eye, this was made with shredded/pulled braised beef brisket. this combined with the rosemary onion aioli made this one of the best beef sandwiches I've ever tasted. the only issue I had with it was that the bread crust was grilled (then baked, i assume) until it was very hard and tough to bite/chew through. minuscule issue, really.   The fries that came with the sandwich were overly seasoned. too much salt - way too much.  aside from the food, i liked the look of the place but it was really loud inside and very cold. Danielle went to the car to get her jacket. the menus are really cool. they paste the actual menu onto the backside of old LP records - which i thought was neat as hell.   since Sunday, I've already gone back to Melt - the new Fairlawn location this time, which is close to where i work - and i plan to go back again. I've now had the cheese steak and the Backyard BBQ (w/ pork) but have to try a few others I have my eye on."}
{"text":"I always get the parmageddon when I'm there and it never disappoints! Between the fun atmosphere and friendly staff, it's always a must when I stop through Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is a novelty. I've been three times.. Each time the food has been ok, the waitresses have had attitude and the meal has left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Fun place and good food, but I think it has def gone down a tad since so many other locations have opened up.  Not as good as the original days."}
{"text":"If we lived closer, I would be morbidly obese. No joke. Their sandwiches are amazing and their grilled vegetables and coleslaw are the best I've ever had. I'm quite surprised that all of the reviews aren't five stars, because other than long waits to be seated, we have never had a less than wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"The Monte Cristo is amazing. That was my first sandwich. You can probably split any of these between two people if you factor in the sides.  Second time I came here, I did the MELT challenge, where you have to eat a 13-cheese, 5 lb grilled cheese sandwich plus cole slaw plus fries without going to the bathroom. I managed to finish the entire sandwich but couldn't do the sides at all. I pretty much failed to strategize and should have taken a little bit of each thing (sandwich, cole slaw, fries) in circles or just gone kamikaze and eaten the thing messily and manically.    If you end up doing the melt challenge, block out a couple days for recovery. I threw up in the glove compartment on the way home and won't even get into gastrointestinal issues."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!! I had the Monte Cristo grilled cheese was so delicious.  I only ate have of it was a huge portion  for me to finish it there so I ate the rest when I got home and was still delicious reheated. The employees  were great very polite you can tell they love there job. The decor was nice to look at while waiting for your food Will be revisiting again."}
{"text":"I came to this Melt location to celebrate my brother's birthday. It was 5 o'clock and we were seated immediately upon walking in, which is awesome! Our server Brett was spectacular. He was super attentive, very friendly and helpful, and willing to offer tons of suggestions. He helped me to pick out a great beer.   As always, the food was delicious. My brother had the Dude Abides and I had the Big Popper. Both were delicious and came out quickly. We also chose to get the seasonal sides: Mexican street corn and crispy queso potatoes. They were delicious and actually my favorite part of our meal!  I usually go to the east side location but I found this location to be quicker and have friendlier staff. I will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"The BEST grilled cheese I have EVER had! Worth the two and a half hour drive we have made twice now just to eat there. Yes, the wait is usually long, but I think I would wait for days, standing on hot coals for a Melt grilled cheese. Their slaw is fantastic, and I don't even eat slaw normally. I had some great corn as a side first time I was there. I don't know how they made corn better, but they did. The second time I visited, I ordered and an extra sandwich just so I would have plenty of leftovers to take home - and also because it's kind of hard to choose from their yummy selections. The decor is fun, and I like the repurposing of the old album covers for menus. Crafty and cool."}
{"text":"I have to give this a 5 since it is funky and so unique! We loved the Soda in a bottle, Black Cherry and Apple!  The GodFather Melt was HUGE!  I have never seen a \"Grilled Cheese\" like that before, a must have..and the fries are delicious to! The staff was friendly to, and we really enjoyed our experience in this Guy Fieri stop! You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"So while in Cleveland during a freak snowstorm we decided to wait out the storm and give Melt a try. We had heard about it from Man vs. Food and some Food Network show. We went on a Saturday night and the place was packed. I couldn't believe that I found a parking space right outside the front door. (FYI. parking at the meter is free on Saturday nights at least)   We walked in and told the hostess how many where in our party. She then gave our daughter a \"Elmo\" name tag and told was the wait would be 1 hour and 45 minutes. I didn't mind so much as we had just came from my test drive of my Cayenne at Porsche of Beachwood so I had a ton of Porsche brochures to read to past the time. I have come to the conclusion that the bar area takes up the majority of the space hence the long wait times.   To my utter joy and excitement, 40 minutes later we were called and seated, 1 hour and 5 minutes before we were told we would be! For drinks I had a pop and my wife and daughter both had Sioux City Cream Sodas.  A cool thing I like about Melt is that the menus are on the back of album covers. I had Michael Jackson Thriller. My wife had Cindy Loper and our daughter  had Madonna. Talk about a 80's party, all we needed were stone washed jeans and some neon. Wow I'm old! LOL!  I got the Monte Cristo (honey ham, smoked turkey, swiss, american, beer battered, mixed berry preserves), my wife got the Parma Italy (breaded chicken, sun dried tomato pesto, roasted garlic & provolone) and our daughter got the 1/2 combo which is 1/2 half kindergarten, soup cup and salad. My Monte Cristo was EPIC and the girls enjoyed their's as well. Our only complaint is that there is no kids menu and my wife's bread was a little over toasted. Our waitress Rebecca was outstanding and never let our glasses get empty.  So is Melt deserving of all of the hype and 2 hour waits? In my opinion........... YES!"}
{"text":"Melt is one of the coolest places and best places to eat that I've ever been in Cleveland or its suburbs!  The atmosphere is great.  Comfortable, yet engaging.  There's tons of cool old Cleveland shit on the walls and the posters they commission for their monthly featured sandwiches are damn cool looking.  They posture themselves as a kind of tattoo-themed place (which is very cool), but the tables are filled with every kind of person, from punks to businessmen to college kids to families.  The atmosphere lends itself perfectly to the menu.  Every sandwich they serve is some variation/derivation of a classic grilled cheese.  This means deep-fried peanut butter and banana, walleye (the \"Lake Erie Monster\") and eggplant sandwiches, along with the classic \"Kindergarten\" (a straight grilled cheese).  The best are the \"Summer Chicken\" and my personal favorite, \"The Big Popper\" (jalapeno peppers, cheddar & herbed cream cheese, deep-fried and served with berry preserves for dipping.  It's a giant jalapeno popper!  Yes, it is as awesome as it sounds.).  This place is so awesome it makes it worth driving from the East Side to the West Side for lunch and almost makes me want to go back home to Cleveland!  Almost.  This is one of those places that makes Cleveland special.  Do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"Another great Lakewood Favorite!  You have never ate a toasted cheese until you had the Kindergartener!  Made with 5 scrumptious cheeses and fresh Jonas bread!  Soups are unique and exquisite!  Had Asparagus Soup and it was delicious!  Only drawback is the size of the seating area but any way you put it it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Simply Great:  Location Look Sandwiches Salads Music Beer Excuse to blow your caloric intake for 1.5 days  There is usually a wait during peak time but it's worth it, grab a beer and hang out.  They are expanding so hopefully the wait will erode without a reduction in food quality."}
{"text":"Love this place! Like most busy restaurants the service can be wonky, but the food always makes up for it. Consistency is what Melts all about. If you haven't been here make it a point to go, I promise you will always go home with leftovers!"}
{"text":"Update last two times I've been here the service has been pretty bad along with a rude waitress, also menu changes (no more burgers)"}
{"text":"I don't know if it was just because I drank a bunch of bourbon before I went but this was a next level experience. Got the Ultimate Fries to start with which in and of itself is a meal, then got the monthly special the Mighty Macaroni Melt (ie a block of mac & cheese grilled and then put inside bread with more cheese on it) and my girlfriend got the mushroom melt and we shared. Again I WAS DRUNK but both sandwiches were like the best thing I ever ate. The mushrooms melt was garlicy gooey cheesy earthy shroomy and caramelized oniony goodness. The Mac&Cheese thing was just like AM I REALLY EATING A GRILLED BLOCK OF MAC AND CHEESE? WHY YES I AM! then I'd shake some more hot sauce on it.  The cole slaw stuff was pretty good too, fresh."}
{"text":"My husband has become obsessed with their french fries so we get take out for him about every other day. On Saturday night, we got sandwiches for the whole family. We ordered ahead (which I recommend because they are very busy) and showed up at the appointed time. But the sandwiches weren't ready. After about a half hour, we started to wonder what was going on because that NEVER happens. Before we could complain, the manager went back to the kitchen to find what was going on. They must have lost our order, but the manager personally apologized to me and refunded our purchase and gave us the hot sandwiches to go. I was REALLY impressed with their customer service. Oh, and the food is awesome too."}
{"text":"I tend to go during non conventional hours because it can be packed around the typical lunch and dinner time. I love the monthly sandwich that changes and at first I thought that their prices were high, but the amount of food you receive is huge. I always have leftovers for the next day's lunch or dinner. The food I've received has always been fresh and my guests have also enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it.  Started off with the fried tomatoes and cheese bites.  Simply fantastic.  The sandwiches are huge!  My wife and I split the Cuban warpig.  It was filled with flavor and we enjoyed every bite.  My younger son got the Mac and cheese sandwich be rated it as one of his favorite meals of all time.  My older son got the godfather and enjoyed it but wouldn't order it again.  Service was great and we enjoyed our meal.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"Maybe the best place we have found in the Cleveland area so far. We are from the California Bay Area and moved here for med school 7 months ago. We were spoiled by the quality and variety of the food in the Bay, so our first couple months in Ohio were tough. Then we found Melt and it kicked us out of our food depression. A 25 pound grilled cheese sandwich can cure all illnesses. It honestly feels like the sandwiches are the weight of bricks. I can eat a lot of food (a whole medium pizza in one sitting), and I can barely finish my meal at Melt. Alone with the hulking sandwich you get a mountain of slaw and fries. This is the ONLY place that i have ever considered splitting one entree with my girlfriend. And it's not just giant, it tastes great too. There's a big selection of sandwiches with different types of meat, cheese, and other stuff on them. And if you don't like grilled cheese (aside from being a dirty communist) there are other things too. Clearing your plate at Melt may clog a couple arteries, but it is surely worth it."}
{"text":"Enjoyable but somewhat disappointing. The Purple Parma and the coleslaw I ordered were both on the dry side. On the positive side, we tried the tofu wings with the vegan sauce and they were delicious! Our vegan diner was delighted that Melt has a separate vegan menu. The kitchen was slow in getting our meals out (it was 1:30 pm and not much of a lunch crowd). All said, we will go back for a second time."}
{"text":"Seating process for large parties needs lots of work!!! Melt should be able to accommodate more than 2 large parties at a time. Just saying...the process was pretty terrible and uncoordinated. We were originally quoted 40 minutes, which turned into an hour and 15 minutes before we sat down. My boyfriend had been observing the dinning area and their process (or lack thereof). He pointed out that they seated a smaller party where they could have kept two tables near each other open for us. He pointed to 3 empty 4-tops at 3 separate areas of the dinning room their party could have been seated. So as the rush of customers kept streaming in, they were getting seated as quickly as possible, no one thinking ahead to accommodate us. We basically were being penalized because we had a bigger party. It was extremely frustrating. Finally two tables in the middle of the floor opened up and we could sit down. We had our waiter call the manger over and we complained.  She at least apologized and gave us 2 appetizers on the house. I understand it was a busy Wednesday night or whatever but that was a pretty common sense problem that could have been avoided had they been organized. Thankfully we had a great waiter who gave us excellent service, and our food was perfect. I don't usually go to Melt with a large party, and I don't think I will ever again :("}
{"text":"Food tasted fine, customer service was okay until they forgot to bring me the food I ordered, then they came to apologize and it was still another 10 min and it wasn't done. I left.  Too many excuses and not enough action."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night, not sure what to expect.  It was busy and very loud, but we were able to get a seat right away.  The waiter was great and the portions are huge.  We had mac & cheese bites for an app., for sandwiches I went simple with the kindergartner and my husband had the cleveland cheese steak.  We should have gotten half portions.  They were so large we barely ate any fries or chips (which are really good also).  Overall we really liked the meal, it was just a little too loud in general."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy! I need a second stomach to store the other half of this sandwich. Does anyone know a good doctor that does this surgery??  If you squint while looking at the sandwiches, they kind of look like a horse or a cow. Anywhat (anywho/anyhow) this place has an amazing range of brown sandwiches (because they are toasted).   This place is clean! I know they have French maids cleaning here after hours and when people aren't looking.  In all seriousness, this CLEVELAND staple is a must try! Not to be confused with Staples, that place is a gip! YELP!"}
{"text":"We made Melt the final stop on our family trip before heading back south, and we were so glad that we made the stop. While there was a wait even after the typical lunch rush hours, the food was definitely worth it. Be warned... the sandwiches and portions of fries and house slaw are not small, so be prepared. Even if you're hungry you may want to split the meal. I can't begin to explain how big other than look at yourself in the mirror... the sandwich is likely the size of your face. Since we did not know that going in, my wife and I ordered different sandwiches, and we were glad that we were able to try both. While size is certainly in Melt's favor, it is the taste that really wins you over. The sandwiches are not just masses of thrown together stuff. They are well thought out blended goodness that simply gives more with every bite. And the good news, you can have the other half of the sandwich for dinner. The service was great and even my four-year old daughter ate everything, so there's that. Highly recommend Melt and truly wish there was one in SW Ohio. Oh, it's not cheap, especially with a family of six, but worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Visited Cleveland/Independence last week and checked out Melt based on the numerous reviews all over the web.  This place is lives up to all the hype.  The wait was long, but it was worth it.  I had the Cleveland Cheesesteak as recommended by the staff (the other choice I had in mind was the Black Cat).  The sandwich tasted awesome, and it is worth going back for more.  I hope to visit Cleveland again in the near future just so I can try the Melt again."}
{"text":"It's just ALL good!!  Huge portions, great wait staff, and ALL of it - extremely yummy!! They also have a bread pudding of the month, which is perfection!!  It's not the fanciest restaurant in town - but who cares?  My mouth is watering as I write this!!  Just GO!!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday after waking out of another place.  The Melt is such a cool place, and we were greeted right away. The food and service was awesome and they made a great first impression! They give you a ton a food too , so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere are always impressive and welcoming. I always thought that their food was a bit overwhelming, but they recently updated their menu to allow half-sandwich/soup/salad. GET THE SALAD. And get bacon on your grilled cheese. Or get whatever sounds good, but get half so you don't get bored with your meal. Definitely get the salad though, because it has sun-dried tomatoes and eggs and oh my gosh I'm still dreaming about it."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! I had the Cleveland Cheesesteak and my wife had the Backyard BBQ with pork. The bread was fresh and crisp. The sandwich was dripping with flavor. I'm drooling just thinking about it a day later. The waiter was very friendly. The service was fast and the place looked like a nice spot to come watch a game. Very large portions, so eat up."}
{"text":"Got take out. -Fried green tomatoes, whole monte crystal, fries and a side of coleslaw. Everything was just ok. Not bad...but didn't knock my sox off. Didn't really care for the peppery slaw. Fries were really good. Order was ready when I walked in. Place was packed and was checked out quickly and front desk was nice. A ton of food (all the above was only $20.) Wasn't even able to finish half the sandwich. Will be good for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Melt is definitely worth a try.... I was really excited to try this place, I mean c'mon look at how many reviews it has and plus its been on TV :)  Well... we went there on a Sunday and of course there was a wait... waited for an hour or so... but I would highly recommend to get there when you are not hungry bc there's going to be a wait... I like their drink menu and beer menu... sandwiches looked alot cooler than what it tasted.  I mean the sandwiches are huge, so you should split one, and they also give you a ton of fries, everyone ended up bringing home at least half of their sandwich... I had the special, the mac/cheese sandwich, which didn't have much flavor, and the people that I came with thought it was good though..."}
{"text":"Melt? More like... Cold. The fries were fantastic. I have 3 friends and I was hanging out with ALL of them yesterday. We got 3 sandwiches total and cut them in half with a knife. It was a good spread, I just didn't know I was gonna be playing that much soccer later. (Thanks to the World Cup) this place has a great reputation and it's food precedes it. Delicious. I liked the sandwich with the shrimp. :( YELP!"}
{"text":"WOW I'M FULL.  Bodacious portions of greasy goodness.  If u r looking for healthy this is not the place, although they had veg and vegan options on the menu.  I had the hangover fries (fries gravy, cheese and an egg) aptly named.  Wake and Bacon good, should have gotten it with cheddar.  But good.  Tasted War Pig was jealous that I didn't get that.  Cool laid back restaurant with cartoons and classic video games."}
{"text":"If you come here, expect a long wait.  Don't expect a grilled cheese like I did.... It's anything but that.  They are HUGE sandwhiches.  I had a great one with perogi and sausage and cheese.... Strange but really good.  Its got a nice grungy and yet friendly feel.  Check it out... its a fun place, but be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"2nd time there. Great food and huge portions. You can get a half or whole sandwich. I barely finished the half I had. Mine was The Dude Must Abide, meatballs, mozzarella sticks, Romano, parmesan and mozzarella. Friends got Monte Cristo and Melted salad. You also get fries or chips."}
{"text":"This was our first time in Ohio. We had heard about melt from a friend. He didn't do this place justice. I couldn't describe this chain with any of the stereotypes you'd use with chains.  The beer selection was astounding. The menu sounded too simple but the selections were ridiculous. the jalapeño popper was great and my boyfriend's dude abides ( think meatball sub with mozzarella wedges) was fantastic.  Even for a Monday night it was busy but a three minute wait we were seated. food took maybe ten minutes. as if that were not enough the waiter gave us a banana bread a-la-mod as a welcome to Cleveland. If you come to Ohio, eat here!"}
{"text":"i have been going to Melt for years in Lakewood ..not to thrilled with the Rockside location...they open at 11AM got there at 11:30 ...2 sharp chicken bones in my Hungry Hungarian and cold fries I hope they are not losing their game!"}
{"text":"I work in the service industry and am very understanding of service mishaps, but this was really really bad. I arrived and sat at the bar for 10mins before receiving a menu, and finally had to ask for one... whatever they were busy. Then ordered a side, and waited for over 20mins for it, reminded the bartender, because maybe he forgot, turns out he did forget, (but didn't communicate that to me).Okay, stuff happens, then waited another 25 mins for my side that I now ordered 45mins ago, now I'm getting concerned and ask for a manager. The manager, Calvin, goes back to the kitchen and brings me a sandwich that I did not order. I tell him that's not what I ordered and even if it was 45 mins is a really long time to wait for a sandwich, let alone a side, which is what I actually ordered. He then begins to argue with me that the ticket time was 25 mins, okay Calvin. Firstly as a manager you never argue with the customer. Secondly, if you had talked to your bartender you would have realized that he had forgotten to ring in my side then in the 20 mins between when I had ordered and he actually put the order in, he had forgotten and put the wrong order in. We then decide at this point, it's time to leave. The bartender apologized for his mistakes, the manager did not.  I give them a  0 for customer service and restaurant management. A pity really because I was really excited about the concept of this place. I will never go there again or recommend them to anyone. This was literally the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. I've also never written a review before. So thank you Calvin, for making me feel the need to download trip adviser to alert people of your terrible customer service."}
{"text":"After management experience at the rockside road location, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"The Lakewood Melt is the original location and still my favorite. I have been here... *starts counting on fingers*... several times. Like a lot. I'm lucky to have friends that worked there and run the spot. I live in Phoenix now, so I basically have to look at the adds for the specials and drool in privacy. And sadly, my Melt tattoo has gotten me no discounts in the valley of the sun. That's right- you get a discount for life if you get a Melt tattoo of your choice.   I have tried almost all of the sandwiches, burgers, and monthly specials. That's a testament for the quality and yumminess of the sandwiches- I typically order the same thing at restaurants. Stick with what you like, right? Not here. Try it all. Favorites include the reuben, parmageddon, chorizo and cheddar, and the mac & cheese melt. I'm always attracted to heart attack friendly cuisine but it's worth it and my cholesterol is still darn low.   The staff is friendly for the most part. There always seem to be at least one or two staff members that focus more on \"cool\" than service, but it's generally a very friendly environment.   I've always loved the quirky decor that mixes Cleveland sports history with giant light up holiday characters. And the murals by Jake Kelly in all the locations are amazing! Yeah, there might be a crazy wait at times, but plan the time of your visit just right and you can walk right in.  P.S. Great beer selection and unique mixed drink selection."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, wonderful service and a funky atmostphere!  I love this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"BEFORE YOU READ PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR OLD PEOPLE!!! So with that said if you have an issue with your server having tattoos then this is not the place for you either! First time at melt and i must say i did enjoy myself. Sat at the bar while we had a 45 minute wait which was decent, it was really crowed so space was limited. I would suggest a larger location. Bartender was pretty cool kinda hippy but cool she helped as much as we needed and I never felt rush loved her wish I could remember her name.  45 mins flew by while we drank and talked now for the food. LOVED IT but for sure could not finish it. The portions are nice like really nice I had the black and blu cheese burger with fries. A lot of blu cheese prob won't get it next time we go but if u love not like love blue cheese go for it. Service was decent just the elbow space, like I said before space. I wouldn't recommend coming with like a party of 10 prob not more than 3 to be honest but hey whatever floats your boat."}
{"text":"I just know I loved my sandwich and my fries. Jalepenos inside , dusted  with powdered sugar outside and berry preserves on the side.  Pretty much a jalepeno Monte Cristo.  It was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Ok food, horrible service, cramped space, a hole managers... what's to like? I have had better luck at the east side bar, but the Lakewood location blows. I don't even know why people line up for the food, it is not anything special. Good, yes. Worth getting pissed off and annoyed to eat, no."}
{"text":"The new space is interesting, very spacious and there was no wait when got there 4:00 on a Saturday. My daughter and I split the chicken waffle sandwich-it was ok no flavor to the waffles.My husband ordered the beef brisket sandwich which was good, he ordered kettle chips (house made and good)-the waitress asked if we wanted the french onion dip for .75 cents ,and we said sure. One our boys had the chicken fingers and fries, and my other son had the melt burger from the child's menu,and it was generous for a kids meal. Prior to our meal we ordered soup as an appetizer The waitress was slow on picking up the soup cups and asking about soup refills. When the order finally came the waitress forgot the french onion dip,and I asked her if they had honey mustard,when she came back it was just regular mustard - ok no biggie. Waitress took a while again coming back after we asked for containers, then we asked for a plastic bag ,and that never came. The ambiance was really nice, however the service was slow. They charged $3.00 for pop!They double charged us for the french onion dip, and they even charged us for the mustard (waitress never told us we paid for that)  earlier she has asked us if our son wanted dip with his chicken fingers and we had said no! Wow they charge extra for everything. When we checked the receipt it was after we paid and it was really not worth it. This is my first review ever on yelp, thought that these little extra charges are little much since their food is not that cheap."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea...the food that is. My sandwich was beef, it was just overly sweet, overwhelmed the palate.    I guess it's just a cheese sandwich I don't get the hype. The wait time is obvious, don't go if you aren't prepared for a wait.  BUT I did enjoy the drinks and the bartender was great. I love that this is a local franchise and I hope they continue to do well."}
{"text":"Loved the food and ambience. Burger comes with fries, add a drink that's all you need, huge portions.  Great place to hangout"}
{"text":"Introduced a few years ago. Everytime I go though the Lakewood area I must stop! Heard they are killing it on the grill front with more resturants opening thought out Ohio. I know why. The store atmosphere is fun as fun as it gets! 1st time I had it, got it again 3 days later. Who would've known a deepfried, jalopeno, nacho cheese sandwich would've tasted so delicious? Enchiladas, pierogis, the works. And that's just the non meat ones. My meat eating friends are always left stuffed but wanting more are well. Ill be back Melt....oh ill be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review because I think a lot of people's complaints with Melt can be so easily helped if they just knew a little bit more about how to do this right!   The wait is long.. DUH. The wait is long because they have a great product and a really fun vibe. Here's an easy solution for you that I have found really helps me out: Go with one or two other people max and sit at the bar. Hover around for maybe 20 minutes and I know for a fact that you can snag a spot at that bar. Full menu is served up there and it cuts your wait time in at least half, if not way more!   Can't cut the group down? Go there early, put your name in and wander around the neighborhood. There are plenty of shops. If it's nice out, you can even take a quick drive over to Lakewood Park. They are pretty good at estimating the wait time here. Wander around a bit then grab a beer and the wait won't bother you at all.   My last suggestion for wait time: Put in a to go order, head across the street to World of Beer and wait for them to call you when it's ready. Pick it up, bring it back to WOB! You can bring outside food there and this will cut down the time waiitng for food by a LOT!   The food might seem expensive but I have literally not eaten the whole thing since I was younger and never seemed to get full. I now eat half and save the rest. Almost every sandwich here heats up easily the next day. I use the oven so it's nice and crunchy still. The fries re-heat well, too! The $10 price for a sandwich seems way more reasonable when you stretch it out for two meals.   The amazing beer selection is still a huge plus. The spinach and artichoke dip is my favorite ever, hands down. Spicy and amazing. The service is always great. It may be a bit slow but the kitchen is small and the staff is so friendly and fun that they make up for it every time.   Just know that you are not getting health food and plan ahead for the wait. You'll have a great time!"}
{"text":"- the only way to enjoy melt is to order 1.5 meals. how do you do that? between two people, order 3 sandwiches!! - by far, the The Dude Abides (homemade meatballs, fried mozzarella cheese sticks, rich marinara, provolone & romano) is frakkin good! - only reason this joint gets less than 5 stars is the fact that we had to wait like 90 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"I went here with my grandmother and cousin and this is THE WORST place to bring an old woman.  It was loud and a little bit obnoxious, but the food was pretty good! I had the regular old grilled cheese, but they had some of the \"crazier\" things on the menu and they loved it.  Mine was good enough.  Nothing spectacular.  It's becoming a Cleveland hotspot, so definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on a business trip. We got there around 5:20, just in time to avoid a wait. Our waitress was great, very patient as we sorted through the extensive beer menu to make our selections. The sandwiches were large - thick bread, lots of fillings, and lots of cheese. I had the Reuben Melt and it was one of the better ones I've had."}
{"text":"I finally took my husband to Melt! We had lunch together last week up in Cleveland and I wanted to take him somewhere he had not been before. We happened to be there around 2 so we had. I wait and walked right in. Our waiter, Chad was really great! He was quick to introduce himself and take our drink orders - and he was also great about giving us a minute to decide on our lunch and answer questions about the sandwiches. Jason had the Parma Italian and I had a Monte Cristo. Both arrived quickly and were absolutely wonderful! We both had eyes way bigger than our stomachs and both ended up only eating one half of our sandwiches... but that's OK I HIGHLY recommend getting a whole and taking half home -  makes for a great meal later on ;-)  We had a really fun time. The atmosphere is really funky and there is definitely something for everyone on the menu. I love that there are vegan options as I have friends who visit and this is a great place to keep in mind for them. My only complaint is it was way too hot inside. There really needed to be some air circulating a bit more to make it more comfortable. Other than that it was a stellar visit!"}
{"text":"I opted to try the Spinach Pie ($8.50): a grilled cheese-concoction of wilted garlic spinach, roasted red peppers, grilled onions, and feta cheese in between two thick pieces of sourdough bread. It was served with fries and their sweet slaw.  One of my friends -- who lives in Cleveland -- said the wait for food could be brutally long. Perhaps I went at a good time, or maybe it's because I placed a takeout order -- but I got my food within 15-20 minutes.  The feta was the star for me here. Just that added saltiness from the cheese imparted an extra boost of flavor in this one. The sweet, peppery slaw is a lovely side dish for this grilled cheese, and the stubby fries were cooked well. There are a number of great grilled cheese choices here, and I found it hard to pick just one.  Melt Bar and Grilled has great food and a lively atmosphere! Hope to come back one day!"}
{"text":"Yumo!  Serving are huge, food is fresh and a great selection.  The bar is well stocked with a great selection of beers on tap.  Definetly a repeat.  Right across from the BNV so it's convenient too!  I love that there were other options for a side besides French fries - I got the broccoli with cheese sauce."}
{"text":"Took an Uber to Lakewood, Ohio to try out Melt Bar and Grilled. MELT has been featured on several Food Network shows. I guess my Southern drawl was on full display because I got the \"Where are you from?\" from the server and the family table next to us. LOL! TEXAS REPRESENTING Y'ALL! Anyway, the older lady at the family table made it a point to tell us that Guy Fieri has visited this place. That shit is important. Remember that.  SN: Adam Rich from Man vs. Food has visited and done the Melt Challenge. It's a grilled cheese featuring 13 different kinds of cheese, 3 slices of grilled bread and a pile of hand-cut fries & slaw. Equals a hell no.   Our server Kayla was great because their menu is overwhelming as hell. I was like where do I start and where does it end. They do have a lot of vegan, veggie, gluten-free options. So everyone is good here. We order whatever Kayla suggested. I was like we get one shot at this. I don't know when the hell we'll be back in Ohio.  My boyfriend ordered the Good Burger which is a black bean burger and all the fixings. It was very tasty and be couldn't eat the entire thing. I opted for the Cleveland Cheesesteak. It was so good with so much cheese. I can't explain the creaminess and salty mix of the sandwich. But it was the best ever. I also didn't finish my food.  We thoroughly enjoyed our food. I have no complaints. I would say what knocked it a star down was the drinks. They were okay and didn't pack a lot of punch. So save your coins and hit up a good bar. Other than that, give a Melt a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food.  Definitely love the combo with the tomato soup, half sandwich and salad.  Seriously the tomato soup is awesome.  Thick deliciousness.  People are not lying when they say prepare to wait.  Not only can it be difficult to get a table at times, it also takes forever to get your meal.  Overall, poor service.  It's not that big of a place that it needs to take 45 minutes to make a grilled cheese sandwich.  Sometimes my stomach gets very upset with me afterward too.  I guess I'm not really sure why i'm giving it three stars."}
{"text":"Fun place to try. Kid friendly. More than fair kids prices. Staff very friendly. Only complaint. Not real cozy? Great art on walls, but tables and chairs in a square room Melts and frys amazing. Try this local chain"}
{"text":"Didn't really understand this place. Mostly I misunderstood why they didn't refill my water. But also, I felt that it should've been easier to have multiple cheeses on one sandwich."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go to! Delicious grilled cheeses that are huge and the decor is fun! Love this place, the best grilled cheese restaurant I have ever been to by a land slide."}
{"text":"Love it! If you're looking for a BIG meal that's the place to go. We always get the full sandwich, and have two meals out of it. We like to take family members when they come to visit. What else to say, good food, nice waiters/waitresses and affordable price for the quantity of food and easy parking situated in the back. Never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Melt has a really great bar and the decor of the place is really nice. However, the wait  is extremely long and the food decent for the price. I order the buffalo chicken soup  as an appetizer and it was extremely salty...i had to put in sugar to tone it down a bit. I also ordered the diablo burger melt and it was pretty good, the taste was there however there were too much bread and  it was almost hard as rocks. Overall my experience was ok...bu go here if you never tried it  the environment is awesome !"}
{"text":"Melt does it well. Great sandwiches, but enormous portions. Looking forward to checking out the half sandwich options.  Great fresh cut fries.  Honestly so much food, just ask for the box when you get served. That way you won't over eat! Great beer selection too.  Basically..it's a win."}
{"text":"I'm not going to weigh this review down with the same things everyone says about Melt.    It's a great place with great food, but I'd say the menu needs some cleaning up.  Very overwhelming and it can take quite some time to figure out what you want.  But hey, as long as you have a beer, who cares right?    Another thing that took me by surprise was the size of the restaurant.  As a group of 8, we didn't have trouble finding a seat, but I can only imagine what this place is like during busy hours.  I can see why they opened a couple of locations.    Regardless, incredible food and a must eat if you're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was really slow. It was busy but not horribly so. I would probably go back, but I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wait staff was prompt and friendly. I had the Dude Abides sandwich and it was really good. Only knock I have is that i wish the sandwich was a little hotter when it came to the table. Felt like it might have been sitting there for a little while before it got to me. Overall I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"My brother took me to this place, and it is my first time being to this restaurant, so I really liked this restaurant. The burgers portions were so big that the two of us could not even finish it, so we had to take it home to finish it. And also the fries were so good too."}
{"text":"FINALLY ate here with my bestie.  It was awesome.  Crazy good beer choice, loved the decor... awesome service.  Plus... THERE WAS A PIEROGI ON MY SANDWICH. YES! SO good.  And I loved that the coleslaw was more vinegar based than mayonnaise based, but that's just my preference. Crispy fries, nom nom.  Cannot wait to come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint.   It is the REAL DEAL!  I had the Rising Sun, it was one of the best things I have ever tasted.   If you are ever in the Cleveland area, this is a must visit."}
{"text":"pb banana sandwich is killer,  place is loud and COLD and service not so great, but keep going back for sandwich.  have had other ones but they all seem to be mostly bread, fries and chips are hit or miss often being cold or stale tasting, but I'm there for sandwich mostly.  Have had cheese wedges - can be good, tried the frys as app - nothing but gravy couldn't eat it.  very cool atmosphere, bring a sweater!  go every few months and patiently wait for food and drinks then box and bill, wish was more staffed for quicker service."}
{"text":"This place is a very cool and unique idea. All menus are on the back of old record album covers. The beer selection is very good and if you want it I'm going to assume they have it. The idea behind the food is that everything is made on a grilled cheese sandwich on thick French bread. I am a big burger fan so I always get the hamburger in the grilled cheese but they have just about anything you would ever want to order on the sandwiches. I do not like the hours. I don't live in the area since they opened so when we are local we make sure to stop for lunch or dinner. When I come in for lunch during the week I have found that they aren't open. I think they only open for lunch on Friday thru Sunday. The place is large enough that we rarely ever have to wait for seating and since this place is located in a shopping plaza it is easy to find a spot."}
{"text":"To be honest I am not a fan at all. The place is so noisy and crowded it is impossible to have a good time or have a conversation. While the food and service were good I have a hard time paying that much money for a grilled cheese that I can't enjoy eating because my brain is being crushed into jelly by the noise level."}
{"text":"Checked in at about 630  PM on a Saturday.  So far this place SUCKS!  It's freaking grilled cheese.  How LONG does it take?  Been waiting FOREVER.  Three re-fills on drinks and STILL NO FOOD served.  This is ridiculous.  Finally the food came.  Portions huge.  The Monte Cristo is bland and the fact that it is fried gave it a bit of a fried fish taste.  Again, service is sucking - Taking forever to get the check.  Finally the check at 819."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to posting this, although it's a few months late lol. I've been to about all the Melt Bars, and I really like this one the best. It actually has a more small town feel than the rest! Clean, great service, and always amazing food. Highly recommend the Hangover Fries, and the last time we were there the special sandwich was the six degrees of Kevin Bacon melt and it was to DIE for. At least three different types of bacon on that bad boy. The beer is always cold with a great selection , and the specialty pops are delicious. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"A must go to if visiting CLE. So many sandwiches your head will explode. Menus are made on the back of old records. Great craft beer selection! Get your sandwich deep fried for some extra goodness. If anyone can finish a sandwich and fries in one sitting.... I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"I had seen Melt Bar & Grilled on Man vs. Food and was excited to hear from friends that it was now in Mentor.  I had some time to burn so I decided to check it out!  I am so glad I did.  I was by myself and sat at the bar (because I didn't have to wait for a table.)  Jennifer was the bartender and she was great!  She gave awesome recommendations, didn't hound me for a decision, and was extremely friendly!  I ordered the Municipal Stadium sandwich!  It was a brat, napa cabbage, stone ground mustard and melted cheese, sandwiched between two pieces of Italian bread.  It was served with a generous amount of house cut fries.  I had to get a box because it was so much food!  It was just as good as left overs as fresh out of the kitchen.  The beers are reasonably priced too.  I think for all the food and the one beer I got it was not even $20 (including tip.)  Ill be back because there are so many more I want to try!!"}
{"text":"I've had the privilege of eating here twice with great pleasure. My first visit I had the backyard BBQ, the second I had the Korean War pig. Both were pulled pork grilled cheese sandwiches with a twist, and a side of fries. Amazing. You will leave very full and uncomfortable if you can finish your entire meal. Very good food, kind people, moderate speed service (worth it) and a good experience. Will return anytime I can."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed eating at the Lakewood location in the past..mainly due to the decor and the menus that are covers of old records. We have also eaten at the Mentor location.  But my husband and I will probably never go back. The sandwiches are way too greasy and I won't go into detail about what that does to one's colon. Nobody needs that much Cole slaw either. The prices are a little high for sandwiches, but the plates are full."}
{"text":"Chicken parmigiana grilled cheese,  your mother's meatloaf grilled cheese,  Chicken and waffles grilled cheese (I had this one), Monte Cristo grilled cheese, Fried Green Tomatoes grilled cheese and the list goes on and on. Deep fried Mac and Cheese bites, YUM!! Tomato Bisque soup was just ok for me. Service fast, friendly staff and great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate at in Cleveland, and man was I impressed.  I'm a huge lover of the sandwich, so this place was like a shrine to me.  I had the turkey sandwich with stuffing, cranberry sauce, and sweet potatoes and it was absolutely to die for.  I couldn't stop saying \"Mmmm\" as I ate.  The loaded fries were equally amazing, and I sat there astonished as this is not what I was expecting of Cleveland eateries.    The sheer amount of beer on tap was equally amazing, and I could have stayed here all day trying them.  It's great for lunch and even better for dinner.  The portions are incredibly gigantic, so come hungry or prepared to haul half a sandwich home.  This place is so good that I asked a friend driving from Cleveland to bring me a sandwich to DC.  No joke.  It still tasted great after a 7 hour car ride.  That turkey sandwich will haunt my dreams."}
{"text":"This place was just ok.  I feel like I was really let down with the over hyping that this place gets.  I almost expected it to be the best sandwich I ever had, and it definitely wasn't.  Maybe one of the biggest sandwiches I've ever eaten, but surely not the best.  I got the Monte Cristo based on the recommendation of someone who had been there before.  It was good, but the bread sucked up so much of the grease (it's a deep fried sandwich)  that I could only eat half.    My wife got The Dude Abides, which is sauce, a meatball, and a deep fried mozzarella wedge.  I ate half of hers, because she couldn't finish it.  It was so big I couldn't put it in my mouth, so I had to eat it with a fork.  The meatball was actually very bland, and I was disappointed with it, but it was ok tasting with the other ingredients.  Again, her sandwich was ok, and very large, but not as good as I was expecting.  I had had french fries for lunch, so I got cole slaw instead.  My wife got the fries, and I tried some, and they were great.  The cole slaw on the other hand was terrible.  It was very dry (our friend who we went with said this was the first time they got dry cole slaw there, so I guess it's usually better), but I would have been able to get past that, but they put huge pieces of raw onions in the cole slaw.  That was unexpected, since I've gotten cole slaw at probably a hundred restaurants before, and I have never seen an onion in cole slaw ever.  I am not a fan of raw onions, so I couldn't eat it.  My wife didn't like it either, so that just went to waste.  I would have to say it's unlikely I'd go back.  I'd be interested to see if I liked another sandwich better, and the prices were very good for the amount of food you get, but the wait is always 1 hour or longer, so it's unlikely I'd be willing to wait for an hour for a sandwich I may not like.  I can just go to Dibella's Subs 2 doors down, spend less money, and get a great sub in less than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Melt?!  If you write in your review complaining about the wait then you need to acknowledge WHY there is a wait in the first place -- the place is amazing!  My favorite is the Monte Cristo and I rarely stray away from getting it.  Their beer selection is superb and I will continue coming back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Located in lovely Lakewood Ohio, this bar and eatery is a fabulous blend of kitsch and very very very VERY filling food. If you don't want to wait up to 3 hours for a table, eat at the bar under the glow of crappy plastic lawn ornaments. Choose your grilled cheese bohemouth off of vinyl record covers, sit back and people watch, and choose from the large selection of small batch beers on tap."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, really lousy service.  I've been three times; one time, we waited for an hour and fifteen minutes and then went to Aladdin's, and the other two it took at least forty-five minutes to get seated.  If you can find the place at a slow hour, though, I do recommend it.    The grilled cheeses are pretty awesome; the bread is very thick and toasty and fresh, smelling of butter.  The ingredients, especially the cheese, are top-notch, but it's not like the grilled cheese you made at home; they're more like Dagwood sandwiches with some cheese in 'em.  Everything I've had on the (limited) menu was decent, but the place is too crowded and so loud you have to yell to hear yourselves speak."}
{"text":"Melt is a must-stop whenever I visit the Cleveland area. I almost always wind up getting the monthly special, whatever it is, and this visit was no exception.  For any of you Big Lebowski fans out there, February brings you the Dude Abides Melt... gigantic beef and pork meatballs, fried mozzarella sticks, topped with marinara, and romano and provolone cheese. Delicious. Huge, too. Another classic from Melt... we need to get one in Columbus badly."}
{"text":"Melt is great but you feel so stuffed after you eat it. My favorite is the buffalo chicken grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Enormous food portions! I had the monte cristo and it was awesome!!! I think it was enough to feed 3 people. If I ate a third of it, I'd be surprised. It was sad because we were business travelers and we couldn't really take any of it back with us.The slaw that came with it was shockingly good. The fries were just ok. I've had better.  The drinks are awesome!! And they have a pretty amazing beer menu. I'd go back just to try more of their beer offerings."}
{"text":"This review will definitely be in the minority here. I can't say I was too thrilled with our visit here. I like the concept but the execution seemed poor.   At the risk of sounding too negative I'll start with these: * Liked the atmosphere. Cool funky decorations.  * Good fries.  * No wait for a table.   We were seated immediately around lunch time. No wait time for our server to attend to us. We mentioned it was our first time here and he simply said \"ok, I'll give you a few minutes.\" There was no effort to introduce us to the restaurant or cover the menu or make recommendations. The most info we got from him was that the kids meal was probably too big for our kid. We should have taken that as a hint for our own meals.   We ordered a jalapeño popper sandwich, buffalo chicken sandwich, and kid's grilled cheese for our daughter. To say the portion sizes are huge would be an understatement. Either one of our sandwiches could have fed the three of us. The popper sandwich had the best flavor. It has a sweet battered crust to it, which I thought was very unique. We ended up splitting that one between the two of us and barely touched the chicken sandwich. It's not the type of sandwich that makes for good leftovers either so it went to waste. The fries are good. Nobody at our table came close to finishing a full meal. Such waste...  My main issues when it comes down to it: * The portion sizes are offensively large.  * The prices are just as large. $10-$12 for a sandwich? Cut both the sandwich and the price in half and make a lunch special or something.  * We were charged full price on the kids meal, when it was 1/2 price Tuesday. Our waiter adjusted it after I caught the mistake.  * Everything just seemed fried and greasy. After eating here, we both felt gross. My stomach is still recovering.   * Service was not exciting or engaging.   I doubt we'd go back if we were in the area. If you stop here, I strongly recommend splitting a sandwich - or maybe even try a salad."}
{"text":"Have loved this place since the first one in Lakewood. From the small restaurant that sold grilled cheese sandwiches and gave discounts to the few who had melt tattoos to the chain that has multiple Ohio locations and worldwide recognition.   When here, get the peanut butter and banana. It's almost too good to eat. It's my absolute favorite and I've honestly tried them all.   The only negative - and it's a small one is that the cost to change a side from fries to another side is WAY too expensive."}
{"text":"As a Clevelander , I'm surprised that this is my first experience at Melt Bar and Grill. I always wanted to try it but finally got around to it. Overall this was a good experience if you like unconventional sandwiches aka deep fried or unusual combinations. My visit included two of the top sellers which are the Monte Cristo and Cleveland Cheese steak. Out of these two I would say the Monte Cristo is better overall even with myself personally being a avid lover of cheesesteaks of any form or fashion.      The only thing I didn't care for were the fries here. Idk whether they were fried too hard or sat too long but they were generally unenjoyable."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this Melt location. I have visited the original location in Lakewood many times, and the East Side location once. The atmosphere was typical of Melt and the location was quite busy as it was 7pm on a Friday.  The wait for a table was shorter than we were told, which was nice. Our server let us know up front that food was taking about 40min to come out. While I think this can be problematic, it wasn't a problem for us and I liked that we were told right away.   Our server was friendly and helpful, especially with my friend's need for vegan accommodations and her to go order for her husband at home. The food did take a long time to come but our waiter was attentive in the mean time and our food was hot and as we ordered. Overall it was a great experience, and held up to the high standard I expect from Melt. I would definitely visit this location again."}
{"text":"I've been here and ordered take out from here many times. Always happy with what I get, I've pretty much sampled their menu. They've got a wide selection of sandwiches,  and have new specials coming out all the time. It's a great place to bring family and friends from out of town. The atmosphere in this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Wow, the Avon location needs help.  When you come in before 5pm on a Sunday, and there's tons of empty tables, and the bar's virtually empty, and they tell you it's a 30 minute wait ... then they tell you some BS story that it's about quality of service ... that by not filling their tables and making people wait, they can ensure better service and faster food.  PURE BS.  They either don't have enough wait staff or kitchen staff.  Epic fail, Melt!  If you're going to open all these new locations, make sure you can operate them efficiently!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to go after seeing of Food Network. Happy that Mentor got one, visited on a trip last year. So CHEESY! YUM!  You may want to share food, so many different sandwiches that it's hard to decide.  We went back on a Sunday morning to have more before leaving Ohio."}
{"text":"This place is worth the wait, trust me. If you lack patience, go right at 11am during the week and you'll probably get seated right away. The drink selection, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, is out of this world.  I'm partial to the Peanut Butter and Banana sandwich. To make it even better, I get it deep fried. Terribly unhealthy but too delicious to pass up. We all need a treat in life.  On the other hand, the Deep Fried Twinkie is not worth it. No offense to the amazing chefs, but I'm not sure they have this technique down quite yet. The Twinkie always arrives too overdone...you can tell because the filling has evaporated! Opt for the KILLER cheesecake instead!"}
{"text":"This place is a Cleveland icon, and a definite stop if you're in the city. You'll have the best grilled cheese sandwiches of your life (sorry mom).  I've been to all three, and this one is my favorite. Since its the original, they have some different things on the menu (unless the menu has changed at all of them since I've been) and have bigger portions. Appetizers are good, but I always make the mistake of getting one and then only being able to eat a few bites of my sandwich. Ultimate fries are delicious, but make assure you have at least three other people to split them with. You'll still have leftovers. Buffalo tofu is excellent, with crispy breaded tofu in a tangy buffalo sauce. Portions are huge, just like the sandwiches.  I've had quite a few sandwiches here. The purple parma is great, as is the veggie burger. My all time favorite is the big popper. Its essentially a remake of a jalapeno popper. How much better does it get than that? Not much, I'll tell you. The sandwich is filled with herbed cream cheese, cheddar and fresh jalapenos and then is deep fried. As if it couldn't be better, its served  with mixed berry preserves, which provide the perfect contrast between sweet, spicy, salty and crunchy.  I always feel awful after I leave though, and even the next day. Hence why this is a once-every-six-months kind of thing."}
{"text":"The food is nothing really special.  The wait is ridiculous- only due to the popularity from Guy Fieri and Triple D.  The jumbo lump crab cakes were delicious with the spicy sauce.  Everything seems somewhat spicy including the hearty and seasoned black bean lentil soup.  The Parmageddon is a heart attack on a plate with fried everything.  The perogies, polish sausage, cheese, etc. was ridiculously big.  The slaw was plain and lighty seasoned- and well welcomed from the mayo drenched slaw.  The Italian Chicken sandwich is pretty good as well.  However, nothing really wowed my palette.  It's just good for a sandwich place.  Sharing is recommended only because of the size of the dishes."}
{"text":"My first time here & I was impressed! Our server was awesome and helped me understand the menu choices (grilled cheese heaven)!!! Only $5 for half of a HUGE sandwich, fries & pickle. Very clean and great casual ambiance. Great place to bring the family (kids included)."}
{"text":"Very good food and a fun atmosphere.  My husband and I stopped by here after a strong recommendation, and I'm glad that we did.  We ended up sitting at the bar, because the wait for a table was almost an hour.  I ordered the 'parmageddon' which had pierogies, kraut, onions, and cheese.  It wasn't exactly what I had imagined (the kraut wasn't very flavorful), but it was good nonetheless.  My husband ordered the el diablo burger and felt the same way - not quite as flavorful/spicy as he had hoped.  The fries are delicious.  They include coleslaw with the meals, but I wasn't very impressed with that (again, kind of bland).  The alcohol selection is great and unique - we tried the banana bread beer, which I actually liked.  Our bartender/server, Steve, was a great guy and very helpful and kind.  I would definitely go back, but I would probably try something different."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place and it was pretty high on my list of places to try while visiting.  We started with an appetizer of the mac n' cheese bites and I'd just give them 2 stars.  They were okay but super greasy and the mac n' cheese was nothing special.  The cheese really didn't taste anything different to me and the flavor was a little bland.  Just hitting those with some simple salt & pepper would have been a huge addition to me.    I ordered the Monte Cristo and wifey ordered a melt sandwich with smoked gouda.  The Monte Cristo is huge and we should have just split that but again flavor wise was somewhat bland and forgettable.  It really didn't hit any big notes with my taste buds.  I would give this sandwich 2 forgettable stars.    My wife's \"smoked gouda\" melt sandwich was even less remarkable.  2 bland pieces of grilled bread with extremely bland cheese that had no smoked flavor at all.  It was like eating paper.  Tasteless and very boring.  I wouldn't even give this sandwich 1 star.    Luckily, our server was great.  I'd give him 5 stars and he did a great job.  He was attentive but not overly.  He made sure we had everything and just made sure there was no problems.  Even when the food was forgettable, I still tipped him 25% because he did an excellent job.    If I am ever in Cleveland again, I just do not see myself going to this place at all because I can't get passed the boring food.  Sorry! Oh, and the calorie and carb count are through the roof.  Doctor scolded me for going there and banished me to the exercise room where I was punished severely.  Lesson learned, doc."}
{"text":"Had the blue cheese burger. Wow, gooood! 2.5 hour wait for seating on a Saturday night but we went to the bar and were ordering in 10 minutes. Fries are pretty good and the coleslaw was the dry type but holy cow spicy!!  Super beer selection too. Friendly bartenders and good service. Great atmosphere. Can't wait til I'm back in Cleveland and I get to go again. Want to try the Russian sandwich."}
{"text":"Saw the story on the food channel and had to try it while in Cleveland.  It was awesome, everything I expected and more.  Long wait to get a table, but well worth the wait.  A must-do whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"Went on a busy friday night it was pretty packed and was given a 45 min wait, totally knowing that would happen I was ok with that but was able to squeeze right in at the bar that offered full wait staff. I am really glad I sat at the bar because I dont think I would have noticed their amazing beer cooler otherwise. The atmosphere it so radically rad with bits and pieces of my childhood strung on the walls. The menu was a little overwhelming and I was in such awe I just belted out something without really knowing what I was ordering \"there was so many to  choose from\" but after ordering I was just as stoked to find my fav beer in the cooler and really did not care what I ordered i just wanted it in its melty glory! the bar maid was helpful with answering the beer questions I was asking and knew what she was talking about \"I really like it when I am given awesome beer suggestions based on beer I like\" when my monster of a melt arrived I was pleased to see hand cut fries and homemade coleslaw hugging my sandwich! first bite was amazing and I cant even explain how awesome the melted smoked gouda was! I cant wait to return to eat my way through the menu and drink my way through the beer cooler. Thanks Melt its places like you that make me want to eat out more!"}
{"text":"Melt! You're so amazing! It's probably a good thing I can only have you once a year!    But you can bet that every time I'm in Cleveland, Melt is happening.  I love cheese, and I especially love grilled cheese, and I especially especially love grilled cheese with STUFF in it.  I have had so many different sandwiches here over the years, from the Chorizo & Potato to the Backyard BBQ to the Mighty Macaroni to the Korean War Pig I ordered most recently.  They have all been pretty darn tasty and I have never eaten more than half of a sandwich in a single sitting.  The only thing better than going to Melt with friends is having a bonus second Melt in my pajamas the next morning.  Or later that night, whatever.  Also a bonus: when we came in on our last visit, my husband was given a name tag with \"Bob Burnquist\" on it, and we had to wait until \"Bob\" was called to get our table.  It was unexpected and weird, and I enjoyed watching our party try to figure out who Bob Burnquist is.  A nice diversion on a crowded Buckeye game-day. :)"}
{"text":"So, my review of melt is not entirely based on their sandwiches, as it is not usually what I get when I come here. Melt salads are a staple of my diet and you can read my check in for the details of the awesomeness of their house and Asian noodle salads. Besides the salads, the other thing I love about melt, again atypical, is the fact that they have plentiful vegan and vegetarian options - which is not what one would think of when one thinks of melt. Any sandwich that you get can be made with vegan cheese (I'll leave it up to you to decide if the lack of lacto is worth the lack of flavor: vegan cheese sandwiches here are more similar to melted frisbee sandwiches, tbh, but maybe vegan cheese is a flavor one's palate grows accustomed to?), many melt sandwiches are vegetarian, and the servers \"get\" most other dietary restrictions. So, if you know Melt as a restaurant with sandwiches you cannot even finish, go back, and give them another try--for everything else."}
{"text":"Grilled PB, Banana & Cream Cheese is insanely good. I don't love the fries or the slaw but every sandwich that came out of the kitchen looked delish!!!!!!!!!  A lot of food for the $$$$, you will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"We went for the first time and I would definitely say they need a defibrillator at each table. No matter what food you order it is definitely huge. It's like going to a restaurant and ordering a large bowl of soup and you get a 16\" bowl with a shallow 1 cup of soup in it. The Melt Sandwich is mainly a thin slice of meat or substance, double dipped or more in thick batter, deep fried in whatever, placed with other items to make it thicker, piled with about 400 calories of cheese, put between an inch of bread on each side, lathered with butter or cooking oil (or battered again) and the grilled or fried to a dripping golden brown. The fries that it comes with can not even soak up the oil since they are saturated themselves. I realize that many people would love this type of food and that it is what our medical system thrives on (if the patient has money). You can not find any nutritional information for a good reason. They have not made one capable of measuring this stuff and it would cause them to lose a lot of business.  We took home our left overs with the intention of making a more healthier sandwich on some whole wheat bread. After stripping away the bread, filler, bread crumb crust, etc. we were left with a greasy piece of chicken (Italian Parm) and a thin layer of Eggplant (eggplant parm). It was so greasy we decided not to add bread and just to eat it with the left over fries. We were sick to our stomachs all night and vowed never to go back. Good luck to those who do not care about health."}
{"text":"This cult classic is famous for it's grilled cheese and double-deep fried french fries. A large portion of the sandwiches can be made vegan, and there are also some salads, soups, and appetizers as well.

{"text":"A must go, but honestly there are so many ingredients in each panini that it is difficult to handle them and even taste them."}
{"text":"Great place. Notorious for having good food. Nuff' said..."}
{"text":"Oh, Melt... What is there to say? Melt was always one of my all-time favorite restaurants, but the last time I went back home, the magic just wasn't there. It's lost a bit of the novelty, I guess--I mean, how many artery-clogging, big-as-your-femur grilled cheeses can one eat in a lifetime before the joy runs thin? I could deal with the ridiculous crowds and long waits (Note to readers: go with someone you can talk to for four hours), so long as the food was good and cheap--I don't know if it's just one Parmageddon too many or what, but my sandwich last time wasn't worth the wait.   Don't get me wrong! It's pretty cheap, the decor is great, there are plenty of beers to pick from, and the food IS good... Just maybe not hour-long-wait good."}
{"text":"I'd say this visit was more 2.5 then 3. Haven't been to Melt in quite some time and we were in the neighborhood yesterday so we decided to stop. We walked in and were seated immediately but it took about 10mins for our server to make his way over and take our drink orders. Another 10mins pass and my wife and I both make eye contact with our server from across the room and he immediately got the \"deer in headlights\" look and made a beeline to the bar. He had forgotten to get our drinks. My wife got her iced tea and it barely had any ice in it so when he came back she asked for a cup of ice and a lemon. The ice came but she never got the lemon. Anyway, we ordered and I went with the big fat gyro and my wife ordered the mom's meatloaf melt. The food took quite a while to come out, like 40mins. The place wasn't even busy. The sandwiches were just average, nothing to write home about. Even with not so great service, the worst thing about the visit was that they took the Parmageddon off the menu. That was like the greatest sandwich ever invented. I really used to love Melt but until the Parmageddon comes back I have no reason to go back."}
{"text":"First off, I have to state that I have never had to wait long at all to get a table at Melt. However, I have an odd habit of vising restaurants at off hours, so I'm sure I'm an outlier here!  Anyway, on to the food. I'm probably beating a dead horse into the ground here,but of course the food is good! At this point, if you live in Cleveland, you have a pretty good idea about what to expect at Melt: a honkin' big grilled cheese and a pile of fries. Comfort food at it's finest!   Definitely a must-visit. My only complaint lies in the seating: if you're seated by a wall, you're good to go. However, tables in the middle of the room will have to deal with being surrounded by a lot of foot traffic. Sorry, but it is kind of annoying! But it's easy enough to look passed that when the food arrives. Oh,and the staff is pretty awesome, too!"}
{"text":"I would literally open a franchise back in my home town of it were an option. I even asked about it when we were visiting. I've heard soooo many people rave about Melt...I even have friends who have gotten a Melt tattoo (apparently it gets you a 10% discount for life).  As soon as you walk in, the atmosphere reminded me of a nicer, cleaner version of our favorite dive bar/restaurant at home. Our service from start to finish was awesome!   The food...just amazing. My husband and I each got a sandwich and swapped halves. Honestly, I don't even think we touched the fries...just too much goodness in the sandwich, there was seriously no room in any spot of our bodies.   The only downside was our pierogis. The taste was great, but it was like $7/8 for 3 pierogis. Maybe that's totally average, but I'll skip it next time, and there WILL be a next time!"}
{"text":"It's best that these don't exist near me, no one wants to see a 500 lb. Nic P. Trust me on this one.  But, for those of you lucky enough to live in Ohio and indulge whenever you'd like, I hate you. Just kidding. Sort of.  This groovy, easy going, yet electric place is part bar, part restaurant, part hang out joint. I can't explain it, but eclectic seems to cover it. The decor, the staff and the food all fit under that heading. AKA AWESOME.  I've been here before and for the life of me can't figure out why I didn't write a review then. Pretty sure it had to do with keeping it all to myself. I'm consistently blown away by this place, never a misstep. The way they have elevated grilled cheese to an art form is a taste to behold. Get here.  I've been all the way through this menu and have found one measly disappointing sandwich. The odds of you finding exactly what you need (you'll figure out you need this place as soon as you indulge) are outrageously high. From meatballs to pulled pork, to waffles and chicken, if you can dream a topping, it's here to add to your thick sliced bread planted in between your favorite cheese.   I've had the chorizo and potato, backyard bbq, the dude abides, godfather and chicken and waffles which was a special. By far, hands down, the best one EVER is chicken and waffles. That mountain of cheese, waffles, some of the best chicken I've ever had and a side of jalapeño jelly that's way more like syrup is a taste blast. I mean, if you think it's fun to eat chicken and waffles with a knife and fork, wait until you pick that sucker up in sandwich form. Your life will be complete.   The others were fabulous in their own way, I think they are all just great sandwiches, but the chicken and waffles was special in the way that shoes are awesome (this is a chick analogy), but expensive shoes are far and above my preference. And so it goes with this sandwich.   The service here is friendly, attentive and fun. You feel like they really like you and want to make you happy. And don't get me started on the every-beer-known-to-man thing they have going on. That and grilled cheese. Okay, kill me now.   Get here, it's a unique taste experience that will make you hate living anywhere but next door to one of these."}
{"text":"Quite the interesting menu obviously. Obviously a place you should check out for I am in the minority for even thinking this place is okay. Food is good not great."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and I get to try many different types of foods all over the country. Stopping by Smash was one of the greatest experiences my tastebuds have even gone through. The food was fresh the appetizers were amazing and each dish has its own unique character. Great place to go and a definite favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with a friend for the first time after hearing about it through the grapevine.   We were told the wait would be around two hours, but regardless of my friends impatience, I held out for a seat at the bar.   After some friendly chatting with the guy ahead of us, he offered us his seat at the bar. Soon a second stool cleared.   Melt offers a great selection of hancrafted microbrews. Bell's family of beers captured my fancy tonight. After sampling the hoppy and light Two Hearted Ale, I went for the Best Hop Slam!  It was slightly fruity, hoppy, and with 10% alcohol I was soon proclaiming it's praises.   After a decent wait, which passed quickly due to the libations, our entrees arrived. A Summer Chicken and the paramount Monte Cristo. While the chicken passed the muster, the Cristo was superb. Ham, Swiss, Havarti on thick toast, bathed in batter, deep fried and dusted with powdered sugar. Halved and stacked, it towered over the strawberry preserves. Encore!!    We left with two boxes due to the the delectable richness.   My recommendations; if you don't want to wait, keep one eye on the bar stools. Enjoy the wide variety of crafted beers. Whatever you order, you will be asking for a to go box. Come April, forget about the long wait, Melt will be opening a sequel at Cedar and Taylor on the East side.  The experience left me literally skipping around the corner to my car, much to the consternation of my friend! If you arrive armed with lively conversation, the wait will be but a wink and you will be enjoying the melty goodness!"}
{"text":"We make sure to visit Melt every time we visit Cleveland. Even though there are so many delicious grilled cheeses on the menu, I almost always get the chorizo & potatoes which is by far the best thing on the menu. This time I tried the buffalo chicken which was also very good. My mom & cousin had the combo where you got soup, salad and half a sandwich for $9, which is a great value. The buffalo chicken soup was good but crazy spicy. The melt salad was amazing. If you love grilled cheese & haven't been here you have to try it. So good!"}
{"text":"Not sure how you do not give this place a five star!  The food is great, and great sized portions.  And as far as wait, go at peak hours, you will wait.  However, I have been lucky the past two times and not had any at all.  Both times around 3:00PM.  So go ahead, play hooky and get seated.  Or, savor the many tasty beers while you wait at the bar."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place forever.   Not what I expected.   It was good but kinda pricy  (15.50 for my meal alone)    other then that it was okay."}
{"text":"Finally visited Melt after hearing great reviews.  My husband and I visited on a Friday afternoon at around 3:30pm. I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated with no waiting. The service was good. Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. In regard to the food....delicious! I got the Cuban and my husband got the Cheesesteak.  They both were very good, hot and cooked perfectly! I also hard the Ace Pumpkin Cider on tap, it was also very good. Just an odd note for those blue cheese fans out there...we asked for a side of blue cheese to dip our fries in....best blue cheese dressing we ever tasted! The atmosphere and decor was modern and interesting to look at while we waited for our food. I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the ambiance. I would like to see some booths and a little heat would have been nice. The place was very cold. My biggest dislike was how loud it was in the restaurant. The dining area was not that full, but the way the building is constructed allowed for very loud back ground chatter. We will definelty go again!"}
{"text":"I am so sad to have to write this review. I was watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives about two months ago, and I saw Melt on the show. I knew I would be in Ohio this month, so I told my family I really wanted to try to come here on our trip. I was so excited to come here.  We attempted to come on Monday, since we were at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Melt is less than 10 miles from there. They were closed for Memorial Day. The rest of the trip we didn't have time to come. My sister lives about 45 minutes outside of Lakewood, and nobody in my family wanted to drive that far to eat.   When we were packing up and getting ready to leave on Thursday morning, I asked my dad if we had time to swing by and eat here before going to the airport. He had me look it up on the map, and he determined that we could squeeze it in.  We drove over here and parked about 15 minutes before they opened. Since I had read that the wait is normally atrocious, I was happy that we were going to be the first ones seated.   Doors opened and we walked in right at 11 on the dot. We were seated. And then we proceeded to wait, and wait, and wait. The place filled up very quickly. By 11:30 there were people waiting to be seated.   The waitress came over and took our orders, and then she didn't come back for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, people at other tables were getting served, and I saw them pumping out to-go orders from the kitchen like nobody's business. I honestly thought we were going to have to get up and leave, since we still had to return the rental car and take the shuttle over to the airport.  About 35 minutes after placing our order, the waitress came over and said our food would be out shortly, and that they had a ton of to-go orders today, which is why we were waiting.   The food arrived. I had ordered a Havarti grilled cheese, salad with garlic dressing, and potato leek soup. My stepmom got an American grilled cheese, salad with ranch, and tomato garlic soup. My dad got some sort of pork grilled cheese that had bacon and ham on it.  None of us liked the food. My salad dressing was literally pureed garlic. I couldn't eat it because it was too strong. My potato leek soup...maybe I was just expecting something different. I thought it would be chunky...potato chunks and chopped leeks. It was just a puree of what tasted like celery and pepper. Nasty.   My stepmom's tomato garlic soup tasted like marinara sauce (must be an Ohio thing, see my review of O'Charleys) and her salad was just so-so.  The worst though, was the grilled cheese. The bread slices were 1 inch thick. So, you have 2 inches of bread, and like, one slice of cheese. The bread to cheese ratio was not good. I ended up taking off the top piece of bread and only eating the bottom.  My dad said his pork grilled cheese was alright, but also too much bread.  The waitress came by to see how everything was and my dad told her to bring the check because we were in a hurry. At this point we had been there over an hour. Apparently they don't fuck around when it comes time to pay up and get you out of the restaurant, cause she brought the bill within seconds and it only took her about 2 minutes to charge the credit card and bring the receipt to us.   I was seriously so disappointed in Melt, and I felt so bad that I made my parents go out of the way and come here. Last time I listen to you, Guy Fierri."}
{"text":"100 stars! Been waiting all my life for a grilled cheese bar! I got the grilled chees that has fried Mac n cheese w bacon! SO GOOD"}
{"text":"Wow!! Talk about the glorified Grilled Cheese Sandwich! I got the mama meat loaf grilled cheese! It was humungous!!! not only a heart portion but so delicious as well. The staff were very inviting and friendly. I loved how the menu is on a back of a vinyl case.   With your meal you get fries and slaw. you can get your fries with cheese and everything on it as well. The monte cristo and the cheese steak sandwiches were on point!  You cant go wrong with any of the grilled cheese. I ordered a pirogi as well. you gotta try it. It's a small potato dumpling topped with cheese . mmm!!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Melt.  The place is ALWAYS busy and you should expect the wait.  I mean, we arrived before they opened on a Sunday for \"brunch\" and there was a line at the door before they opened!    Our server was great, and VERY accommodating considering the couple we were meeting ended up bringing their two kids and we had to expand our table.  He didn't rush us either, and considering the wait and the fact that butts in seats = $$$, I found this exemplary.  The food was MELT standard, crazy, and carb-a-licoius.    If you've never been there, then you need to make the trip...at least once."}
{"text":"First off let me say this. I absolutely love the melt! I have been to many of the other locations and enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, and the staff. I also really hate rating places low because I like to see the best in everyone.  My experience was not the same here. The manager was extremely rude. I had a few questions concerning my party (seating, etc) and before I could even ask the questions he cut me off and was shaking his head. He was arrogant, was not understanding and did not care about his customers at all. He made our visit extremely uncomfortable, and my entire party was disappointed with his inability to be professional. Due to the scene that he caused, my party did not feel welcome here and we chose not to eat. Whether he was having a bad day or not, it is very important to stay professional when at work. We did not appreciate being treated in a condescending manner before we could even speak."}
{"text":"Love it. I had gone the big popper and it was really good. My wife had gotten the gyro melt and that was utterly amazing. The fries were OK and but I'm not a fan of coleslaw so I didn't need that. The decor was amazing"}
{"text":"Busy---but love the first come-first served \"wall bar\" option. Excellent beer selection too. I don't get the hype on this place tho...it's the food that makes us fat-assed and lazy. That said, I like \"fat-ass\" food from time to time and if you do too, Melt fits the bill. Portions are very generous - buy one meal and share it with your dining partner."}
{"text":"Retarded great sandwiches. The half sandwich and side salad was plenty (like I couldn't finish). Tried the Chicken And Waffles this time but will be back for more. Also 25% food AND drink on Mondays for industry night!"}
{"text":"This is a Cleveland classic now as the original Lakewood one has spawned so many satellite locations - I hesitate to call it a \"chain\" only because that word is despised by so many foodies but it kinda is now that it's also in the Columbus market.   Anyhoo I digress the food is still on point - I mean you know what you go here for - a cheese baby to land in your stomach and take up residence for at least a few hours! I have my favorites but do try to go for specials when they have them AND honestly maybe get hungry for them like 3 times a year at most.   This trip was the New Bomb Turkey special with a cup of the Buffalo Chicken Chowda - yummo!  Ate half the sandwich / some of the fries - really MISS the delicious vinegar based coleslaw that used to come with sandwiches.  Took the other half home as the server said it would reheat well/better if I grilled it again - um yeah nope but I did eat the inside stuff with some boxed mashed potatoes (improvised it).    Still a solid Cleveland place just a bit more pricey than before in terms of ales, beers and sides - and not for things that require a holy grail like quest - I mean fatheads and Great Lakes we can all get cheaper than $6+ and the bottles selection is not something hard to find anymore. I just will not skip above soda or tea when I see that sorta thing - but that's me!"}
{"text":"Maybe I need to give this second chance - unfortunately I was in town for a business trip and don't anticipate being there anytime soon.  I went here under advisement from colleagues and friends, and of course - a nod from the travel channel and food network doesn't hurt.  I gotta say - I was disappointed. The colleagues who joined me were mostly satisfied -but it seems a lot of the hype might just be about the prices/portions themselves (a ton of fries and slaw).  Maybe I'm just bitter because it had been built up so much for me.  I didn't enjoy the slaw. 1 or 2 bites, ok, but it was by far over-peppered. And I like spice - I enjoy much hotter food than the majority of people, but it was like someone just got black pepper happy, making it almost unbearable.  The fries were good, somewhat limp but definitely not bad.  The sandwich itself was to have their housemade vodka kraut (which i just ended up taking off), smoked gouda, turkey and russian dressing on the side. All of the components were good, but my cheese wasn't even melted. At a place called \"Melt\" - you would at least expect that. The russian dressing I'm pretty sure was just thousand island - but it was good. I have no idea where their bread comes from - but it was toasted nicely and super tasty - honestly the best part of the sandwich.  They do have a pretty great beer selection and a full bar, but I wasn't in the mood to drink. I did try some of my associate's watermelon wheat ale and it was pretty good.  I think all of the hullaboo really just is about the comfort food factor and the fact that they have the melt challenge ($30.00 to try). Otherwise, I could make a grilled turkey and smoked gouda at home - and actually melt the cheese."}
{"text":"Don't know what all the fuss is about. This is a grilled cheese except the bread is so wet you can hardly eat is since there's so much grease! This isn't the best location for it but it works."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. Waited for almost an hour  on a Friday afternoon. Small cramped dining area--waiting area was larger than dining area and food was only so-so. My time & money could have been better spent!  On the plus side, good beer list--lots of great beer on tap & in bottles. One of the best in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"By far, the best restaurant for vegetarians and vegans who still crave meat (and those who don't as well). Almost every sandwich has a vegetarian option and several have vegan options. The best part: they don't change the sandwich! They use substitutes for meat that have similar tastes and textures. My favorites: hot buffalo chicken, cheese steak, and summer chicken, but I think these are the only ones I've tried.Even if you aren't a vegetarian, think about giving one of these a try with vegetarian option. You won't be disappointed.  Also, this seems to be the ONLY restaurant that acknowledges the fact that little kids tip over cups when they drink with straws. They have cups with lids and long, bendable straws that allow my kids to sit in their seats and drink from the straw without tipping their cups.  Speaking of kids, this is my son's favorite restaurant, so they do know a thing or two about toasted cheese!  A few more things: excellent selection of beer on tap and in general, great atmosphere (my kids love the FREE video games and all the stuff hanging on the walls, including the owl outside), and servers have always been friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is a vegetarian's (and probably vegan,too) dream! Especially if you are a vegetarian that misses particular meals that require meat. I never thought I'd have a philly steak and cheese sandwich again, but Melt makes one without meat and it is delicious! Most menu items have a vegetarian option that replaces the meat with plant based items that have a similar taste and texture as the meat they are replacing. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Ok, let's talk about it...imagine the BEST grilled cheese you have ever had - now times it by ten and you probably still aren't even close to the deliciousness that is Melt. This place was Amazing! Melt was highly recommended by every person we talked to when we said we were going to Cleveland. Our wait was about an hour, which was fine because then I was good and hungry by the time we were seated. When we ordered, we were greeted by a very laid back and uber helpful waiter. He was awesome and gave incredible recommendations about how to best upgrade/compliment your sandwich. He even talked my tablemate out of getting her original order and suggested her to get a sandwich more specific to Melt. This is something I can truly appreciate.  He definitely helped to make our experience all it could be. Our table had a variety of selections - The Kindergarten, The Dude Abides, The Big Popper...etc...everyone enjoyed their sandwich. Your sandwiches come with coleslaw and french fries. You will NOT leave hungry. The portions were seriously huge. The bread is thick and toasted to perfection. I ordered tomato soup and clearly did not need it. If you are in Cleveland, you must go to Melt."}
{"text":"Mentor is one of the larger Melt Locations. No matter how busy it gets (and believe me it gets busy) the service here is absolutely second to none. This fact added to the Melt fun vibe and amazing food really sets this place apart."}
{"text":"Huge kudos for the vegan options. The vegan vegetable grilled cheese was AMAZING. Since it was relatively light compared to the meat options, I was able to finish the sandwich and slaw and make a decent dent in the fries. The fries could have been better seasoned but the sandwich blew me away. The restaurant was packed so service was affected. I would love to visit when it's a bit slower."}
{"text":"I love Melt... And having it open up only 2 minutes away from my house is great too. I'm not really known for long reviews so I'll get to the point. The food is great! I love their Cleveland Cheese steak sandwich (ITS HUGE!!). The fries are good too, well seasoned. I'm not crazy about the coleslaw, but to each their own. Some of the appetizers are really small too, hardly worth it. (Like the pierogies or crab cakes) Nachos are huge though! If you want a substantial app, those are pretty good for the money. Service? Awesome! I don't know where Melt hires all these people, but I've always had really great service. Friendly, prompt, attentive. The decor is really sweet too! Love the giant WMMS sign they have above the host station. And the awesome mural on the wall?! Me and friends love to try and name everyone on it.     Cons: Expensive but worth it. Expect to spend about $45 for two people. (App, two drinks, and two sandwiches)   PACKED! On a Friday or Saturday you can expect to wait at least an hour. But also, worth it.   Overall, if you live nearby, Go. Seriously. Go and enjoy all that is the Melty goodness."}
{"text":"Never had a below excellent experience at any location. Even better now that is in Avon."}
{"text":"It was a disappointment. The tomato soup is not soup at all. It's a bowl of marinara. Tastes like marinara and is thick like it as well. The bread for the sandwiches is sliced so thick that it overpowers the flavor of the cheese and the crispy grilled sides. It has the atmosphere and quality of a national chain: generic. Lockview in Akron, while not perfect, is way better. I won't be back."}
{"text":"this was my first and last time ever to melt, I ordered a shredded bbq chicken sandwich and found maggots crawling around inside. IWas so freaked out and disgusted, I will never recommend nor will I ever return....  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"I struggled with giving either 3 stars or 4.   I was excited to try this place because of all the hype and it not YET being in Columbus.   The wait is long. We waited about an hour for our table to open up and then maybe 20 minutes for the food. The portions are big. HUGE. The portions are the definition of AMURICA.   I had the special, a Reuben Melt. It was good, the Russian dressing was delish. I wasn't a fan of the slaw that came as a side and there were WAYYY too many french fries.   I feel like once is enough. You feel so gross afterwards."}
{"text":"Classic Melt experience and much closer to home. Started with the fried pickles and had the Melt cheeseburger with fries.  Always enough to eat for lunch and can take half home for dinner or lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Nice melted cheese sandwiches and beers. Friendly and helpful attentive staff. Parking meters in the front we got a great spot and got lucky I think."}
{"text":"Great vegan menu! Delicious food and good selection of craft beer. Did I mention great prices?! I love this place! The decoration is fun and staff friendly. Two thumbs up, 5 stars, just fabulous!"}
{"text":"It's grilled cheese like you never imagined! Each grilled cheese is unique in its own way, and more than enough food. Get a whole sandwich and save the second half for tomorrow's lunch. I've gone multiple times and the service is always good, and the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three or four times and I've never had a bad meal. Just ate here again yesterday with my husband and son and once again the food was outstanding. I love that I can get mine vegan while my family can eat what they want. The portions are huge, the fries are my favorite cheat food and the slaw is incredible. Favorite Cleveland spot to stop when we are in town."}
{"text":"Melt is simply the best. Whenever I'm home from school, Melt is always one of the first places I go. Although the wait is long, it's definitely worth it as everything I've ever ordered has always been delicious. When I come here with my family, they are always accommodating to my dad's strict diet. The prices are fair and the decor is very representative of Lakewood itself. Believe the hype, this place is great.  My favorite sandwich is the Kindergarden and I usually get it with tomato, pickles, herbed cream cheese, and avocado. Sandwiches are big enough to split. The soups and salads are good as well.  If you don't feel like waiting as long, get it to go (although you'll miss out on the energetic atmosphere) or try to east side location."}
{"text":"Ughhhhh.   I can barely muster the energy to write a review. Just thinking about eating here makes me want to vom.   I was waaay excited when I heard there was a restaurant specializing in grilled cheese deliciousness, with homemade bread, deep fried yumminess...a full bar. I was prepared for the wait - 40 minutes - knowing full well we'd just find a seat at the bar. What I wasn't prepared for was the heat, hotter inside than out with a broken ac. I suppose even that would have been tolerable if the smell of sanitizing soap wasn't mixing with fried grease and wafting through the already stagnant air. An off duty employee - very nice guy - was the only saving grace if the place, being that he was super polite and confirmed we could just share one order.   Sadly, even that was too much. We split a Monte Cristo, a monster of a sandwich with some sort of berry preserve side (which the server forgot to bring out) that tasted like the oil it was fried in hadn't been changed in days. We ate the sandwich, walked out happy for the experience, and within ten minutes regretted every bite we'd managed.   I could never eat here again, even if I lived in Cleveland. Apparently they've had a lot of \"haters\" reviewing, but I give em three stars for concept - I say my experience, however, wouldn't merit even those three.  In short: if you're going to deep fry something, do it well."}
{"text":"Off the hook good food. Great environment, good service and the food lived up to the hype. If you have a bad experience here it was just an unlucky night or you have shitty karma. We are on an insane 3-week road trip and this is one of the top two places we have encountered. Jim n' Nick's in Tennessee was also spectacular.  The Melt puts Memphis BBQ to shame, as weird as that sounds.   Come here to eat. If you are disappointed, you just got unlucky or you are a chronic complainer and people don't want to hear your bullshit anyways!  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So. Much. Food. What I learned about Cleveland (I'm from NYC), is that they give you a LOT of food for relatively cheap pricing. At least they do at Melt.  The decor here is wacky cool. They have football and stuff playing on the screens, so yay. Wait time was pretty long (20 minutes), but from what my boyfriend told me, that was like the shortest wait time ever. I figured as such, because as soon as we were seated around 3:30~4:00, people just started pouring in. I guess this place really is that famous.  So the menu is really extensive. They have monthly specials, and from the sound of things, they also have occasional weekend specials (my boyfriend had this sandwich called the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon... lol). He had the monthly special this time, which was the mighty macaroni melt. I had the monte cristo, which the server told me was their most popular item. Uhhhhh freaking amazing. The whole sandwich comes out fried, so I was only able to finish half of it. The cheese and the berry preserves are sooooooooo good. I kind of felt sick afterwards; there's that much food. It also comes with a side of fries and coleslaw, which alone pretty much cover the whole plate. Leftover take homes are pretty much a must.  The server also recommended the Sioux City Sarsaparilla, which I had never tried before. It's really sweet for root beer, but I LOVED it. Trying to find it in NYC, but I can't. If anyone knows where I can get it (I really don't feel like ordering it off amazon), please feel free to message me.   Food was great, service was great, and had extreme food coma afterwards. Awesome Cleveland experience."}
{"text":"A must-eat in Cleveland.      I heard tale of this popular chain of specialized grilled-cheese restaurants.  When a work trip took me to Cleveland I knew I had to try it for myself.      Amongst the hipster-friendly, appropriately-lit atmosphere I took in the many names of noshables on the menu.  I decided upon the \"Mom's Meatloaf dinner\" grilled cheese sandwich    A buttery bonanza of meatloaf, mashed roasted garlic redskin potatoes, chipotle ketchup glaze, and muenster cheese.  Yum!     The bartender was friendly and explained his choice of having an action-heavy zombie-slaying sci-fi visual feast playing on the bar TV to accompany the carb-carnage that Melt's patrons were about to unleash on their stomachs.  He was right!    Additionally, it was great to see an assortment of quality craft beers, while still not losing focus on supplying a lot of the local flavors, including a bunch of options from Great Lakes Brewing.    I definitely reccomend.  Thanks."}
{"text":"This was so sadly mediocre. We got the pierogi appetizer. 2 pierogis for $7. When we asked the server why the app was $7 and it's $4 to add 2 pierogis he told us it was because of what it comes with. It comes with a tiny pile of onions and sour kraut a little bit of cheese and sour cream. That's ridiculous. I got a sandwich with chorizo hash in it. The chorizo tasted like corn beef hash from a can and the potatoes in it were raw. No one else enjoyed their food all that much. I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Jennifer and I went to this location before the pink concert in downtown Cleveland. We got a onion ring appetizer, that is good not amazing they could have also had a better dipping sauce that tasted like a thousand island dressing.  I got a chorizo and potato melt sandwich, it was also good but would have been even better if they had put some form of sauce on it. My idea would be something spicy, and my fries were good and seasoned well.  Jennifer got a gyro melt and fries. again it was good but a bit dry.  I wish melt would move in the youngstown/warren area."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first Melt experience.  Having never been there before I had no preconceived notions.    I went with a larger group.  We got seated quickly due to someone in our group doing recon 2hrs ahead of time (Hint).  The atmosphere was eclectic.  With gloriously tacky 70's Christmas decor, 80's arcade placards, old beer/motor oil metal signs, somehow it all worked for me.  The service was attentive and friendly.  My sons and I couldn't place the people vibe.  I thought hipster.  My sons thought some kind of punk.  There was a lot of \"ink\" and self mutilating piercings.  When in Rome...right?    My sandwich was really good and massive.  I had some kind of red raspberry dipping sauce that was good enough to drink by the glass.  The fries seemed fresh cut and reminded me of carnival style.  The beer and drink selection was very good of which I partook with great zeal.  I found the pricing matched the quality, quantity and overall experience."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Great Beer Menu, Very informative bartenders and the food is very original.  I had the Smokey Russian which was excellent, and my wife had the Parmageddon which was good as well.  The French Fry;s were good, the coleslaw was average/dry.  Great experience and will be going back."}
{"text":"Was *not* very pleased with this place... The wait was outrageous, and for what, grilled cheese? The service was sub par and the food was just ok. It wasn't anything to write home about. You'd think after hearing all the rave reviews of this place, that it was bound to shine. It was just a plain ol' sandwich, but too bready and with flavorless fillings. I got the Parmageddon, and it was just a mouthful of mush imo. Why in the world would they ever use a dense bread like Texas toast? There are much better sandwich shops out there for the price especially. This place is super expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Savory deliciousness smothered between two pieces of buttered bread.....  The Melt has a great history that is available online, along with current promotions & specials.  This location is on the corner of Reynolds Road & Mentor Avenue (Route 20).  There's plenty of parking on the southwest corner of the shopping plaza.  Atmosphere was casual & comfortable.  It was full with customers, & the sound level was tolerable (not loud, not quiet).  Drink menu was up-to-date, which is always important with the vast list of craft brew varieties.  The record album menus are always cool to check out, & I wondered where the heck do they get all their wall decorations & lights (you'll understand when you see it).  The food was on point.  First, the kids' chicken finger meal was huge, & the chicken fingers melted in your mouth (yes, I stole 1).  The sandwiches are so delicious.  Today, we tried Chorizo & Potato as well as the Peanut Butter & Banana.  We were feeling a bit more adventurous, & it certainly paid off in taste explosions!  The C & P had full flavor, like a great chili with twice baked potatoey texture.  The PB & B was super sweet, actually honey smooth with a raw sugar cane complexity, & the banana just set off the flavors of the whole sandwich - surprisingly awesome!  We were seated immediately by the door host.  Our server made the drinks & checked in on us often; Jennifer was excellent!  She made sure everything came out right & retrieved a stranded banana from the kitchen for my daughter.  She also registered us into the BIG CHEESE CLUB & provided us a card with points earned today toward savings later.  We dine out a few times per week.  Price-to-value was about average for what we usually spend, but the amazing thing is - we all have about half our meals as leftovers, so the serving portions are plentiful.  They do offer half orders, if you're not interested in a later reheat.  Overall, Melt's food is so enticing; we are destined to come back for a return visit just to try something new!  Other greats from previous visits are The Monte Cristo & The Big Popper (spicy).  Some great deals will definitely allure us back soon with a guaranteed return visit - Old Skool Burger Season, Spring 2018 (April/May/June), check it out on meltbarandgrilled.com, also Service Industry Mondays receive 25% off food & drinks, wow!"}
{"text":"Wait, Wait up!!  Grilled cheese delightful sandwich creations & NOW burgers for a limited time only, WOW, just WOW!!!.....  Lakewood is a beautiful community located just west of Cleveland and on the Lake.  It is filled with beautiful, historic homes and buildings.  Well worth the drive around, especially if you come in along the Lake, while you're on an adventure around Lakewood, you'll also notice many pockets of street shops, restaurants, & bars to stop.  Most of Lakewood has street parking within a short walk of any destination.  Private or public parking lots are here & there, just be aware as well as courteous to owners.  Melt is located on Detroit Road just east of West 150th/Warren Road & lucky enough to have an inexpensive public lot at the rear entrance with electronic (credit card) meter booths.  Melt wasn't too busy for a Wednesday afternoon, but we still paid the $1.00 per hour plus the free half hour.  The City does monitor the parking spaces, and as a gage for a party of two (2), on a not so busy day, we needed about one (1) full hour or so to relax & enjoy ourselves.  Melt Lakewood's atmosphere is always casual, cheery, & high energy (great for family, friends, or couples).  It's fun to eat & watch the Lakewood pedestrian street life passing out of the big glass windows.  If by chance there is a wait, then take some time to take in all of the elaborate wall memorabilia, cool stuff.  Brett asked for drink orders & the Heavy Seas (Maryland) Tropicannon on draught immediately caught my eye.  It was a satiating citrus IPA, so much beach flavor without as much of that hopsy IPA kick.  We always debate between all of the wonderful menu items; it's like a sandwich treasure trove!  Today, we went with the Mighty Macaroni Melt with side V.O.D. - Melt's unbeatable broccoli and the El Diablo Burger from \"May's Old Skool Burger Season\" menu.  We concluded in unanimous agreement that the mac melt was the best mac & cheese ever, just out of this world.  The El Diablo was on fire.  You know when that spot in your throat gets thunderstruck?  Sauces, flavors, & spices mixing so well, which a Latitude 42 (Michigan) Rainbow Weasel American blonde wheat ale nitro style beer was the perfectly smooth & flavorful fire extinguisher.  Brett provided excellent service & attention; he could scientifically read the heat from my face & rapid drop in beverage levels to check on beer refills.  Weekday lunch usually doesn't have much of a wait for seating, and Brett was the man with recommendations (El Diablo & extinguisher).  Food presentation is always spot on, & you'll have the option of full or half sandwich options.  Melt is on the higher end price wise for sandwiches, but these are high quality & gloriously tastebud bursting mouth bombs.  Plus, you will have leftovers for a revisit later at home.  I've tried so much, and I've never been disappointed - be adventurous & go for what you love!  There remains so many sandwiches on my Melt \"to-do\" list that I always look forward to a return to one of the many local locations."}
{"text":"Seriously, I don't get everyones intrigue with this place.    *We had a 30 min wait, when there were 9+ tables we could have been seated at.  All I can assume is that they're just not wall organized/ managed, because it appeared they had the staff.  I get that sometimes good places have a wait, but this is not that situation.  *The food is gimmicky.  Way too much bread.... greasy buttery bread.  The fries were made in house, but that's almost a minimum expectation when you're getting a $15 sandwich.  *The server rounded-down when she gave me my change back.  (I paid cash, and was expecting 6.27 back.. I got $6).  It's just rude to assume I don't want that .27 cents)  Look, if Melt was in an airport, or if I were drunk.... I'd go back.  But, that's not saying much.  I'm assuming this is the sort of place that the locals know better than to go to... but they pull in the out of town crowd."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Cleveland. If you like microbrews, the selection in bottles and on tap is amazing. You will spend at least 10 minutes deciding on which beer to have. Then you will spend another 10 minutes deciding on your food selection. The specialty of this restaurant is the grilled cheese sandwich, with every possible combination of ingredients you can imagine. Take your time. you will be satisfied with whatever you order. The one drawback to this spot is that it needs more space. Matt Fish, the owner, did expand a couple of years ago, but it is still too small. There is always a waiting list to be seated on Fridays and Saturdays. I wish that the bar had more seats. Otherwise, it is a great place to unwind."}
{"text":"I think the idea and the hype definitely outweigh the real experience. I have tried four or five sandwiches and for the most part they were OK, but they also all made me feel pretty gross after I ate them. Can't imagine eating here on a regular basis.  The portions are very big which is somewhat ironic because these gooey and greasy sandwiches are best when eaten right away making terrible left overs. For that I wouldn't even recommend getting takeout. If you look past all of the hype in reality Melt is just decent restaurant with a cool concept."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Great beer selection, HUGE food servings, and great atmosphere.  The food is fresh and flavorful.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Fuck yeah! Does not get much better than this.  I had \"The dude abides\" a toasted sandwich with meatballs and mozzarella sticks and a tasty IPA to wash it down.  Huge portions, I wish I could take this back to Australia with me."}
{"text":"This place is very overrated.  Way too much bread for the below average meat they buy.  I got what is supposed to be some awesome burger called Fat City Burger.  they put so much honey ham on it that was about all the flavor i got out of the first 2 bites.  so i pulled the ham off in order to  get a real sense of the flavor of the beef.  1 more bite later and still not a good taste i pulled just the meat out, all alone and tried that, terrible.  the other plate i got was The Parmageddon which was 2 potato & cheese pierogi, fresh napa vodka kraut, grilled onions, sharp cheddar.  i only took a couple bites because the combination of all those ingredients did not taste good together.  both sandwiches, if they were 4 inches in height, bread accounted for 2.5 - 3 inches of that.  way too much bread for a flavorless sandwich.  maybe that's how they get you thinking what you're eating is good, throw some bread with butter and maybe a touch of garlic all toasted to hide the terrible ingredients they have.  i would bet my life they don't use fresh ingredients everyday.  i guess their is a chance I bought the wrong dishes but i got what I typically get and what they recommended as \"this will get you back here\"  not even for a coke"}
{"text":"I love the melt! It can have a wait time but it's worth the wait. This is the original one that opened in Cleveland. I usually get the dude abides and it is basically a grilled cheese with meatballs and marinara sauce on the inside. It's amazing! They have vegetarian options too. The ambiance is chill and casual. Their decorations are a bit out there but their grilled cheeses are a bit out there so it ties the place together. The service is decent. I've never had a bad experience in the restaurant. However, my only complaint about this location in particular is that parking is scarce. You'll have to park on a side street and walk to the restaurant. It's not a long walk but it is kind of annoying. So if you want a parking lot there's one in independence with more parking."}
{"text":"This is a causal place for a nice meal. The portions are huge! So be hungry when you come because there really isn't such a thing as a light meal. They have options for vegetarians and despite it being a place for gourmet sandwiches they have gluten free options. I have tried the dude abides sandwich, mighty macaroni as well as the parmagedon. I have never been disappointed with the food. Their sandwiches come with a side of fries and a pickle. If you're looking for a nice beverage with your meal I highly recommend their electric blue lemonade. I gave it four stars because their service can be pretty slow. But honestly it's not that big of an issue."}
{"text":"Over the top food! The craziest grilled cheese you can even think of. I ordered the Chicken & Waffle Grilled Cheese it was great! More food than you can handle. You will need a doggy bag or an extra stomach."}
{"text":"Great food, huge beer selection and the Sunday brunch is a must."}
{"text":"Went yesterday in the midst of a snow flurry.   The decor is quintessential bar, with cherry toned wood paneling, numerous TV screens, and a fairly loud selection of music.  The beer list is prodigious, spanning more than 100 varieties.  The food list comprises mostly sandwiches and burgers with copious amounts of cheese.  I elected to get the Corny beast, which I'd imagined to be a monstrous corn dog.  As it turns out, it was a grilled cheese sandwich that was covered in batter with a hotdog inside.  Its relation to a corndog?  The fact that it was served on a stick.  While I couldn't finish it, it was definitely a good way to get your calories going fast... so if you're famished, this is a quick way out of under-nutrition.  It might put you into malnutrition in the other direction!  Not bad, not great... still, I might be back for the beer..."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Melt in Lakewood on a recent drive-up to Cleveland from Southern Ohio. We used to live in Lakewood about 30 years ago and wanted to see how the area had changed. It was about 2PM on a Wed. afternoon when we went in & we were able to street- park right in front of the place. We were immediately taken to our table. I had the \"Kindergarten\" cheese sandwich with my choice of cheese and I ordered cheddar. It was tasty, large, buttery, gooey and tasted like a toasted cheese that you would make at home except the bread was very thick. My husband had the Meatball with tons of dripping, gooey, mozzarella. Again a very large sandwich with thick cuts of delicious bread. Definitely greasy grilled and gooey.  We also ordered and shared the Peanut Butter & Jelly bread pudding. I love bread pudding and make it a lot. This really wasn't bread pudding. It was more like milky moist bread with peanut butter in between the two slices with a jelly sauce, ice cream and whipped cream on top. I was disappointed with it and would have never ordered it if I had known it was not \"real\" bread pudding. Real bread pudding doesn't need any extras on top of it.  I realize this restaurant is extraordinarily popular, and I've seen it mentioned on TV shows but after having eating there I don't understand why. The service was good but the small table stuffed in by the bar was not comfortable. The atmosphere was OK with old Cleveland memorabilia on the walls. Our bill with soft drinks came to about $34. We probably would not return."}
{"text":"This is a concept restaurant that is long on concept, and short on pretty much everything else. I had to go find someone to ask us what we wanted to drink, and service was spotty after that.  To top it off, they messed up our order. The food was better than good, which made up for most of the poor service, and they insisted on chomping our drinks. Bottom line though it is a lot to pay for a sandwich in a 'clever' atmosphere."}
{"text":"You won't leave here hungry. I wouldn't bother with desert or appetizers unless you have three people to share with. The best thing about this restaurant is definitely the variety of food for vegetarians and vegans. The standard melt burger is tasty layers of seasoned and grilled tempeh, sandwiched between two slices of toasted bread with pickles, tomato, lettuce, and cheddar. They also offer meat or vegan cheese as substitutes. You also get like 100 boardwalk style fries with each meal. The bar is fully tapped with rotating varieties of beer and their signature cocktails looked promising. This would be my regular spot if I lived in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm so obsessed with this place. I've been to all the locations and they are all equally great. I live in Indianapolis but come to the Cleveland area 5-10 times per year to see family. I always make a point to go. Only bummer is that winter chicken isn't on the menu anymore!!!! I'm hoping next time I go I can request it anyway."}
{"text":"There are a ton if vegetarian and vegan options here. Almost everything can be veganized. We got two seitan grilled cheeses and loved them both. The tofu wings were so-so. But come hungry since the servings are huge. And vegan!"}
{"text":"This place is just not for me.  I've not had a sandwich that really wowed me, the fries are of the extra greasy variety and the spinach dip appetizer was seriously a couple of tablespoons worth of dip.  I've tried a couple of their colossal sandwiches, but haven't really enjoyed any of them.  I might go back for the Shrimp Po Boy or the Fish & Chips, but after previous experiences I'm relatively certain I'll be underwhelmed and I just don't handle disappointment very well.   I know the buzz about this place seems to have everyone in a state of hypnosis, but honestly there are better burger joints, and much better beer selections elsewhere. When you combine the 45 minute wait with lackluster food and a uninspired beer selection I really can't see myself going back unless a guest has some burning desire to go there...and I couldn't convince them to go elsewhere...and they forced me."}
{"text":"My wife and I took our daughter there on Friday night. We wanted to know what all the hoopla is all about, this place used to have 3 hour wait. We didn't have to wait at all when we got there about 9pm. I am still trying to understand what the big deal about this place is because we were truly disappointed. We ordered Cleveland Cheese Steak (their take on Philly Sub) on a gluten-free bread and our daughter ordered Kids Burger. All the sandwiches were very greasy (which could be good or bad but for us it was little to greasy). The biggest think about the sandwiches is the bread and not the substance itself. The sandwiches were over-peppered and our daughter's burger was like a plain burger - nothing special. Fries were average. We did like the Vegetarian Chilly, it had a bit of a kick to it. Don't think we will be going back there"}
{"text":"Well, I've been avoiding Melt since they first opened in Cleveland.  Not because I thought I'd hate it... oh no... I KNEW I'd love it.  And let's face it... bread, butter, cheese?  Not exactly a great diet.  Ignore my dumb prejudices, and read on...  I had the Green Tomato BLT.  I would have to say that my sandwich was probably the \"healthiest\" option at the table, if there was one.  :)  The sandwich was amazing.    I tasted the Big Popper (Great Popper?) sandwich that a friend had.  WOW.  That sucker is deep fried, and has every single right flavor going on inside it.    The service was spot on, very friendly and helpful.  We were there at lunchtime, and it was fairly full.  The place was clean, and seemed like a place I could easily spend time after work.  The bar selection was excellent - I do love a good beer selection!    Plenty of parking.  Easy to get to.  I'll go again.  (I live closer to the Lakewood location, but parking there is a little more tricky!)"}
{"text":"I've made one trip to Melt and am already looking forward to going again. Large helpings of great, unique food. Worth every penny. Don't be cheap, grab a craft brew (or 2) with your meal and walk out a happy (and stuffed) man."}
{"text":"So so good! Creative grilled cheese makes them unique and fun! Super cool decor and their grilled cheese is so great! They have a bar as well! Great service!"}
{"text":"Food is great, they're always accommodating to my vegan diet and the takeout time is always reasonable. The cocktails are always fabulous"}
{"text":"I got the \"My Big Fat Greek Meatloaf\" sandwich and my husband got the Parmaggedon. We both loved our choices. Do not be deceived, these are humongous sandwiches- not for the faint of heart. But the sandwiches are so well put together that you make room. And we loved that the menus were on the back of old record sleeves. I think my husbands was David Bowie circa the 1980s."}
{"text":"Their pear beer was good and worth trying if you like something like and tasty. Probably girls prefer them more.   Even though we went on a week day, the place was still impossible to get seats! We ended up just finding a place to sit at the bar. Unfortunately they don't take reservations either.   Their special sandwiches are usually very good. I love the grilled bread. The sandwiches are hot. Oh they have Saracha sauce, which is rare for a sandwich place!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to coming here while visiting the Cleveland area. I settled on what they call the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, why \"wet\", still not sure, the ranch dressing was in a plastic cup on the side, and not much blue cheese taste in the sandwich slaw. The sandwich was large, the chicken was crispy and covered in buffalo sauce and tasted good, but in no way represented any form of grilled cheese. My sides consisted of cole slaw and a pickle spear. There was generous amount of cole slaw, but it was substandard at best. I only ate a little bit of the slaw and two other people in our group didn't eat theirs either and had the same opinion. The pickle was a good garlic pickle. The service was adequate and attentive. I guess my expectations were something else. If I come back, I'll seek out a more traditional grill cheese with fries."}
{"text":"I've been to this Melt location a number of times and the food and service is always good.  This time our party ordered the Purple Parma, Hot Italian, and the Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches.  All sandwiches came with fries and we all liked our choices.  Melt is not for anyone into light dining!  The sandwiches and fries are very heavy.. but delicious!  I used my CLE Seats app to get a 15% discount.  I'm new to the app and wasn't too sure how it worked but the manager was very nice and we figured it out -- saved me nearly $10!"}
{"text":"One of my hobbies is to visit restaurants that have been featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. I was so excited to find out that Melt was in my area. My friend and I were so determined to try it that we waited 2 1/2 hours just to get in. (It's not normally that bad.)   Nowadays, it is my favorite restaurant. My go-to is the Chicken and Waffles with the Buffalo Chicken Chowder instead of fries. I never hesitate to try the sandwich of the month. I have never been disappointed with anything I've tried on the menu.   You have to at least try it once!"}
{"text":"Gigantic grilled cheese.  During the road trip, we were looking forward to this since about 5am.  We called in our order for Smokey Russian and Porky Cheese about 15 minutes from Cleveland, thinking we could just pick them up when we arrived, and settle down to a good lunch while we got some time out of the car.  It was a 45 min wait for carry out.  When we did arrive the place was packed on a Friday.  If we didn't still have 1300 miles to drive, I think we would have spent the afternoon at the bar, drinking pints and snacking on sandwiches.  They are truly colossal, so you might want to split one if you're not starving.  Fries are super tasty too. If you live within an hour, it's definitely worth a drive."}
{"text":"The most over hyped place in history. My girlfriend and I both ordered sandwiches  and we both hated it. The food consists of 4 inches of bread, 2 thin slices of meat, and less cheese than an individually wrapped slice of American cheese. On top of food that is less preferable than McDonalds, the service was borderline intolerable. It took 1 1/2 hours from the time we sat to the time we left, which includes the 5 whole minutes it took for our drinks to be served which is also when we ordered.  Long story short, don't buy the hype. Go find a real restaurant."}
{"text":"Melt is good, but the wait is LONG...I don't know if it's the worth it for a grilled cheese...Make sure you get something \"exotic.\" Stay away from the chicken sandwiches.  Love the monte cristo!"}
{"text":"Never in my life did I think I would experience such a wonderful place. They've done such a phenomenal thing to make adult grilled cheese sandwiches and indeed they are to die for! I was able to customize just a regular grilled cheese sandwich, but there are plenty of options that are on their menu. The atmosphere was so much fun, and I felt much more trendy than I actually am. The portions are insane, so be ready to have some leftovers! The only problem I had was with my waitress, whose name I forgot, but she just seemed a little out of it and not so friendly. Other than that I have no complaints! Please go and check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This place is freaking fantastic.  I was such a happy fat kid here.  I had 'the Dude abides' and my only suggestion would be to cut that meatball.  You can't put the sandwich down once you pick it up.  Also, the half was enough!  I had a couple drinks that were fantastic and loved the fries.  Really cool place if you want to be bad!  It's so good you don't even feel guilty :)"}
{"text":"The Melt = star of Cleveland. It's a total staple of the town, proven by the long waitlist. The only real good time to get a sandwich is at 330pm in the afternoon at the \"daughter\" location in Cleveland Heights!  The concept of variations on a grilled cheese is BRILLIANT! Good job, the Melt. Their sandwiches are generally tasty - I usually go with the mushroom melt (portobello) and I've had the chorizo and potato before. It's ok. I'm blown away by \"Thanksgiving Dinner\" which is turkey, stuffing, butternut squash and cheese dipped in cranberry sauce. AMAZING. The sandwiches usually taste a little sweet, which is interesting.  You get huge portions for a good price. Sandwiches come with fries and a little cole slaw. The sandwich usually turns into at least 1 other meal for me.... the sandwiches warm up well in the toaster oven.  There's a lot of hubbub at these restaurants. The west side is the \"original\" so I'd check it out, but it's almost impossible to get a good table without a long wait unless you show up early at 11 or 1130am for lunch.  I usually come here for lunch but I hear they have an amazing collection of beer!  This is def where I would take visitors!"}
{"text":"The only disappointment I feel related to Melt is the fact that it's all the way in Cleveland and/or I don't have an extra stomach (or three)!  What you see is what you get: super tasty, creative, well-executed, and huge melted cheese sandwiches! I went for the Big Popper - think awesome jalapeno popper in sandwich form (with a mixed berry preserve dipping sauce) - but agonized choosing between that and at least three other sandwiches to the very last minute!  Be warned: Melt fills up fast! My buddy and I were the first ones there, arriving shortly before opening, and the place literally filled up within 10 minutes or so! I would gladly go back the next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"My heart is melting for melt. These people know what they are doing, and they do it well. Everything from the menu to the overall look and feel of these restaurants seem like they would be easy to carbon copy and make for great growth opportunities for these owners. Lord knows Melt has a loyal following of local Melters in Cleveland. Yes, props for that!   So maybe this stripmall location is lacking some of the charm with which the Detroit Ave store overfloweth, but everything else is pretty much the same except for one very important thing; waits are much, much more appealing here than at aforementioned store.   We ordered pirogies as an appetizer, I chose the veggie burger and Erin ordered a Reuben. Both sandwiches come with fries, and are huuuuuge.   Our 'entrees' arrived before our appetizer which was kindof a fail. Another fail was that our fries were stonecold, so those had to be returned and exchanged for a fresh batch which came out piping hot, crispy and satisfactory.   I tend to be apprehensive in regards to veggie burgers as you never know what you are going to get. Most often than not either the flavors are lacking or the consistency is off. If you're really unlucky you will be presented with a Garden or Boca frozen patty, items that would not satisfy even if you hadn't had solid food for a week. Imagine my surprise when I take a bite out of one of the best, homemade veggie burgers I have ever had. The spices used are incredible, there must have been at least ten in the patty alone. The burger is topped with tofu mayo, which was surprisingly creamy and tasty. I will warn you that the patty is slightly mushy, but nothing I couldn't handle. This 'burger' is in my top five best veggieburgers for sure!  Erin sortof enjoyed his sandwich. I think. It is obvious that Melt is not his favorite place on Earth, though he cannot really explain why. By the time we were finished with our food, our appetizer still didnt arrive. We had to ask what happened and canceled the order - a pirogie dessert didn't sound too appealing. The manager apologized, took the appetizer off our bill and packed an order to go anyways. All was handled fair and professionally which we appreciated.   I had hoped this Melt rematch would have bumped up the 'starage', but sadly Erin is still not a fan. Though the veg burger was great, our experiences as a whole continue to be kind meh. That's okay though, I'm still a fan."}
{"text":"My first initial instinct was to indeed jump on the love bandwagon, as the food is just so original and well executed. But then I remembered some of the things I disliked about this place. Things that for me were enough of an issue to go from Yay! Im a fan to A-OK.  On a cold winter night, my man and I were feeling like some good, solid grub. During my LBY (Life Before Yelp) I would often visit out of town places with the help of the always charming Mr Guy Fierri and his Triple D. Cue Melt.   What I did not expect however (again, at this point I am clueless of the most awesome website evah) was having to wait over an hour for a spot at the bar. Holy Grumbling Tummy!   We ordered pierogies and a reuben to split. The menu holds a ginormous amount of original and funky melted sandwiches. The word \"grilled cheese\" do not do them justice. Unfortunately for us, our waiter was a very good example of poor waitmanship. Unless of course, the term waiter refers to keeping your customers waiting. In that case, he would be the posterchild for this job.   Though the food was good, I will most likely not return simply due to the long wait times. Dont get me wrong, I am fine with long wait times, as long as I see instant sparkles and silver unicorns appear when I take a bite out of something. At melt I got confetti and ponies. Though cute, they just dont come close. I think sometimes a restaurants popularity can become its own Achilles heel."}
{"text":"I know, I know. \"Only 3 stars for Melt? WTF is wrong with you?!\" Well, it's not anything major- but rather a bunch of minor things. Put them together in one place and it gets annoying.  1) Something is ALWAYS COLD. Today, despite seeing my item appear in the window- and not sitting there too long, mind you- I dug into the admittedly huge meatball on my Dude Abides, and the middle was cold. I was expecting it and in too crappy a mood to care enough to bother the waitress. Figure out how long it takes to microwave the thing to 165. The fries, while not cold, had been sitting around for a while; they were mushy- as usual.  2) The waitstaff, while always personable enough to do a passable job, never do anything or act nice enough to get more than about 15% (again, as a former waitress, I round up). They were not busy enough to be under any pressure today.   Will I go back to Melt? Sure. It's an institution. But these problems are constant, noticeable, and fixable."}
{"text":"So fun! I think you have to order the right thing, though. We went at about 6:30 on a Monday night and had to wait for about an hour. Lakewood, the town, was adorable--we found a coffee shop down the street (delicious pumpkin spice lattes!) and read while we waited.  I think the trick to Melt is knowing what to order. I had the Big Popper, and was pretty pleased by it (though we all know I couldn't eat the whole thing). My vegan friend got the Mushroom Melt with vegan cheese, and was also thoroughly satisfied. However, another friend of mine got the Godfather, and was pretty disappointed. I think it was just too much for her, and she found the sauce of the lasagna to be a bit off. I had a bite and would tend to agree. However, the fries were great, and there's so much on the menu that it's almost certain that there'll be a few duds. I want to go back to try the winter chicken sandwich and even just a soup/kindergarten combo!  So, Melt. Gimmicky? Definitely. Perfect? Absolutely not. But good fun, and a worthwhile experience? Of course."}
{"text":"Used to be good before they branched out. Now the original people left, the replacements are rude and unaccommodating, and their food quality has dropped drastically. I know people close to me that were weekly regulars that now refuse to go back."}
{"text":"OMG! Cheese coma! If you love cheesy sandwiches or mozzarella wedges take the time out and go here! We started off with the mozzarella wedges and it was just amazing!!! I had the Shrimp Po' Boy and added Harvati cheese to the pepper jack it comes with and it was superb! He got the Cleveland steak and had pepper jack and Swiss added on and it was bigger than his mouth! The brisket was scrumptious and I had to get a few bites! Both of us had most of our sandwiches left to take home (the Cleveland Steak was still delicious the next day). We decided to try the fried twinkies...he hated it...I love LOVE LOVE them! The mixed berry preserve cut the sweetness with its tarty bite and I'd go back for just that. Over all staff was friendly and food came out quick. We went in on a Friday around 4:30pm and got seated right away. Also tried their microbrew it wasn't bad at all! Fruity after flavor reminded me a blue moon."}
{"text":"True to the positive reviews! Huge portions - enough to feed two. Had the Chicken Pad Thai Melt w/sriracha sauce... A must eat melt. Ordered the fried twinky. I am not a fan of sweets and the fries Twinky didn't change my mind. Staff was friendly and attentive. Fun place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Incredible staff and large portions! Maybe a bit too large. But for the $, more than worth it! Staff is friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. Atmosphere is loud but fun and different! Perfect place to be your regular bar or your once a year vacation stop!"}
{"text":"Melt is Melt. It's fun, different, eclectic and feel good food! The food gives you so many different options with so many different flavor profiles!! If you're looking for a fun, delicious, experience- go to Melt!"}
{"text":"I've never managed to eat my entire sandwich in one sitting. Huge portions. I had the Chicken n Waffles SO GOOD!!! My daughter had the Mighty Mac n Cheese which everyone begged to taste. My wife had the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken which she regretted ordering only half, because she wanted to take some home. Other sandwiches ordered Parma and Cleveland Cheese steak both superb. Great customer service. Attentive server. Would have been 5 stars if not from the woman sitting at another table who was scream laughing constantly like a laughing hyena. I wanted to get up and tell her to calm the f___ down, but my wife wouldn't let me. Everyone around her was annoyed. The wait staff should have told her that she was too loud or frankly asked her to leave. 20 minutes of that.Dont worry we'll be back, but be in control of the environment."}
{"text":"Went outta my way to find this place on a trio from chicago to Cedar point to cleveland.  Had the dude abides; sauce wasn't the best but the sandwich otherwise was tasty and definitely filling.  Side sauces great, server awesome,  atmosphere cool, tofu wings definite must."}
{"text":"I honestly think melt is a little overrated. The wait is always outrageous and you leave feeling like you're about to have a heart attack.  I also never thought I'd say this, but too much bread."}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever!!!! Went there with my son. We both were so happy we tried this place. Sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon. Bartender was as nice as could be.  I ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich. Heaven on earth. Fries were perfect. Great beer selection.  Can't wait to get back to area and try another sandwich."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you can count on to give you an extreme food coma every time. But it definitely lives up to the hype!   My all time favorite sandwich is the Backyard BBQ with pulled pork. I'm such a sucker for sandwiches/burgers with BBQ sauce and Melt does it right by adding onion rings in it :)   Be warned, the service can be quite slow!"}
{"text":"I just do not get the hype.  It's a pretty ok place with a decent beer list.  Nothing I would rave about.  Eaten there several times. Have not found anything that i would crave or go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Visited after a recommendation from the R&R HoF. Great decor, and a friendly staff. Not a vegan, but plenty of great stuff on the menu for the carnivores among us. Had the War Pig, and with a little hot sauce it was amazing! Good beer list, but didn't sample any this trip. Plan to make this a stop on our yearly trip to the area."}
{"text":"They seriously need to shut this place down.  The food is a bit too good.  I've gotta say though I am scared I'm gonna get fat!  I eat there about once a week and I savor every delicious morsel."}
{"text":"Metl is one of only two restaurants I have been to where I will gladly wait more than an hour for a table. I have never had a sandwich that wasn't amazing although I can particularly recommend the God Father and the Count de Monte Cristo.  All of the portions are large enough to cover two meals. If you have enough room for dessert it is also amazing."}
{"text":"Enormous sandwiches! We sat at the bar and the bartenders were speaking about personal things probably not appropriate for customers but overall we had a good experience."}
{"text":"This is it. This is where you go if you want amazing grilled cheese sandwiches. You found it.   I got the kindergarten throwback grilled cheese with extra cheese and bacon. The bread was sweet, fluffy and amazing. I don't like fries, but I got those too with a sweet aioli... They were amazing. My friend Pur'Tonya got tomato soup to dip her sandwich in. The soup was chunky, cheesy, savory, and delicious. She couldn't finish all her food so I finished it for her... For my country.   We got the fried Twinkie to make sure we ate as unhealthy as possible. Let it cool down a bit... You'll taste more of it.   The service was freaking amazing. Eric with the awesome spiked black hair gave us a warm welcome and our server was epic as well. Everyone was so kind and helpful. Maybe the sharp cheddar got to my head... But I'm pretty sure I want all of them to marry me. Everyone that works here. Yeah, the chefs too. I don't care about your political or religious beliefs. This is America, I should be allowed to have an amazing marriage ceremony with everyone who works at \"Melt.\" Why are you stopping me?  Enjoy your food. I wish I was you, discovering it for the first time again. God... I'm so jealous of you right now."}
{"text":"Oooooh man. I went to college in Wooster, about an hour and a half south of Cleveland, and there was nothing better than hearing your friend say, \"Hey, I'm thinking of going up to Cleveland this weekend and going to Melt.\" We'd pack eight or nine of us into a car and drive on up to begin our journey of love at Melt.  The all-time best grilled cheese I have ever had at Melt was their Cinco de Mayo special, consumed the day after my college graduation when ya girl was nursing what was, essentially, a two-day hangover. Grilled cheese is one thing. Enchiladas are another. An enchilada grilled cheese is its own rare, wonderful, beautiful bird. It should be on the menu all the time. My other faves include the Parmageddon, the Fish and Chips (when it was still called the Lake Erie Monster) and the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken.   If you get a grilled cheese tattooed on you, you get free sandwiches for life at every Melt location. I'm not really a tattoo person, but my God have I considered it. I don't miss Ohio at all, but I do miss those trips to Melt, when we'd eat and drink ourselves into a cheese-and-craft-beer coma."}
{"text":"Sandwishes are just toooooo big! The bottom of the sandwich was soaked with grease and sauce.   Basically it's better that they don't mention the calories per dish (...)"}
{"text":"Whomever thought of putting a pierogi onto a grilled cheese sandwich and stuffing in some kraut and some onions deserves a big kiss.  (Although I would recommend said kiss apres-onions.)    Melt totally lives up to all the hype. I was there with my best friend visiting from New York.  When we arrived, the host told us an hour and a half would be the wait-  and then he glanced over at the bar-  \"Oh wait!  If you two go fast, you can snag those two spots that just opened at the bar.\"  Love him.  We did indeed snag those two spots at the bar.   Our bartendress was awesome.  I think her name was Penny.  We opted for 21st Amendment \"Lower da Boom\", a 10.5% ABV beer that they have on draft.  It was a deep dark mahogany color with aromas of fig.  Hell, yes. Deliciousness.  Yum.   The bathrooms are downstairs.  There are chalkboards in there so you can leave comments, reviews, your phone number, etc.   Dara left me a message on the wall in chalk.  It was a nice surprise to discover whilst sitting on the toilet.    So I suppose I should share some information about the sandwiches.  (Aside:  when I lived in NYC there was a restaurant on the Lower East Side .  I believe it was just called \"Grilled Cheese\". A little hole in the wall.  I don't know why it closed, but it did.  I've been trying to find something like this place again.  Melt Bar and Grilled is really nothing like that, but it did just made me think of that place.  I miss you, sweet Grilled Cheese place in NY.)  Ok where was I?  Oh yes, the sandwiches!  So we of course had the Parmageddon (that's the one with the pierogi) and then the Northcoast Shores:  crabcakes, spinach, herbed cream cheese, or somesuch goodness.  There were loads of fries with it, which I dowsed in malt vinegar.  And then that yummy beer.  Oh it complemented my dinner so well!  We were so stuffed from all the deliciousness that we had to take half of our sandwiches home for the next day.  And then we came back again the day after that for dessert around lunchtime.  No wait.  Sat at the bar again.  We had bread pudding, which was okayyyyy, but not the best dessert in the entire world, although it gets a lot of praise, apparently.  Once again- very awesome and very cool staff.  We even met some other New Yorkers.  Since I am new to the area and Dara was visiting, we asked the people who work there for some \"must-see\" things to do.  They recommended \"Flower Child\" and \"Big Fun\", which were great suggestions and I'll write about in later reviews.  Melt Bar and Grilled:  much like my move to the greater Cleveland area, it ROCKS."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because you get a  RIDICULOUS amount of food....but my husband thinks that great!  Not that this place needs another glowing review but the food is killer!  I had the Hot Italian... WOW...  It was one of those rare moments that I had food dripping down my hands and absolutely did not care...sooooo good! He had the breakfast burger and it was awesome.   Wish we lived closer to Cleveland!!!  The food is a little slow, or at least was for us but we weren't in a hurry so it was fine.  If you want to eat your meal, do not get an app!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying \"Cleveland Rocks!\" (Explanation Below)  **Warning** be prepared to wait! (Over 1 1/2 hours for us) So as we walk in for lunch in mid-December this place was packed! When we inquired with the too cool for school chick at the desk, we were told it would be a 2 hr wait (and that was just for take-out). The three of us ordered the Monte Cristo, which was easily the best I have ever had but gets a 4-star review for the overabundance of bread.  Oh and the explanation of Cleveland Rocks! is as follows:  With MELT overly packed and unable to find a seat at the bar or anywhere without bumping into someone, we decide to walk down the street to find a less densely packed pub. As soon as we hit 2 blocks west, I see to the side of us that there is a crack deal going down so very literally we saw Cleveland Rocks. Pretty frickin cool!  Tip: Avoid going anywhere but directly to MELT"}
{"text":"okay okay okay, im gonna review this, BUT i have a disclosure before i do so. **I was at the bar, a few drinks in so i really dont fully remember the taste** HAHA. okay but here goes what i DO remember.  Got there on a saturday night around 7:15. The place was PACKED. 2 hour wait but i managed to push my way to the bar which is full service and got two seats. There was plenty of seating, but every last table was booked. Its a casual atmosphere, very \"bary\" not a word *shrugs*. Darker lighting, some cleveland nostalgia, very friendly staff.  The bartender (Vinny) was THEE man. Clearly from my disclosure above lol. So we had a round of drinks, i got the peeeeach (peoch). BOY was that thing made to perfection, the alcohol perfectly masked, no wonder i had 5 of them -_-.  We started off with some mac & cheese bites. They were PERFECT. SO creamy and cheesy, fried nice and lightly crisp. OMGGGGG. so good. I ordered the blazing buffalo sandwich, only a half because those mac & cheese bites were heavy.  The sandwich was crispy chicken smothered in hot sauce,but it was paired with a blue cheese sauce, lettuce tomato...SO good. I kind of regretted not ordering a whole, but to be honest the half was plenty.  Those drinks KEEP THEM COMING!!! Overall i had an awesome time ( from what i remember) and i will 100% be back!"}
{"text":"Melt in Mentor is great if you want a grossly huge grilled cheese with more than the works.  The prices are decent but on each occasion I have dined in, the atmosphere is very different (read: more family oriented, dull, typical) than the other locations in Lakewood and Cleveland heights.  I think this has less to do with the business itself and more to do with the general population of Mentor (I am from Mentor and when I want to go out and find a good crowd I am not doing it in my hometown).  Long story short: Go if you want a lot of food and to give a huge Melt sandwich a try.  Don't go if you want a lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious! I've never seen so many creative types of grilled cheese sandwiches. The kids menu was perfectly portioned and my kids actually liked all of the choices! I had the Cleveland cheesesteak and it was amazing. I'll be dreaming about it for days! The vibe was cool and the service was great. The only thing I didn't absolutely love was fried twinkies for dessert but really that could just be personal preference!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm certainly not going to get \"Review of the Day\" for this less-than-stellar review of Lakewood's golden child.  Ah, well.  Facts is facts...  I finally made it to Melt last night.  After having turned away from the hour-plus wait on previous occasions, this time we were seated in a scant 45 minutes.  Now, believe me when I tell you, I truly wanted to like this place...   THE UP-SIDE:  Melt pulls you in with a very pleasing - albeit noisy - atmosphere.  The lighting is low key, with splashes of light and color throughout the dimly lit scene.    The crowd seems happy - happy to have endured the long wait, happy to be soaking in the atmosphere, and happy to be happy that Melt is, indeed, making them happy.  The menu offers a truly inspired selection and feels fun to both look at, and order from.  Melt is an experience to be had - you feel like you are a card carrying member of, \"Club Fun, Different, and Happy!\"  In addition, the servers are incredibly down to earth and sincere - something that probably isn't too easy to pull off, given their constant state of mad rush.   THE DOWN-SIDE:  The food.  I wasn't in the mood for a sandwich with meat, so I decided to go with the \"Purple Parma.\"  While the eggplant inside was going to be lightly breaded and fried, I figured it was a safe and tasty bet.  Well, the \"Purple Parma\" should be called the \"Greazzzzy Parma.\"  I haven't had that much oily grease leak onto my hand since the last time I worked on my parent's riding lawn mower.  Upon arrival at the table, the bread on the bottom half of the sandwich was already soggy with grease.  Trying not to cause a fuss - somebody else was treating for dinner and I didn't wanna be a total complaining tool - I held the sandwich in a napkin and ventured on.  Do you know what a Hiatal Hernia is?  Well, I've had one for years, but it rarely acts up.  The torrent of grease running out of the \"Purple Parma\" and down my throat revived that hernia from hibernation in seconds flat.  The best thing I can say about that sandwich is that it could play a major role in any upcoming oil change you may have.   THE SUM-IT-UP:  Melt is a cool place.  I'm guessing lot's of people like the food, or it wouldn't be anywhere near as popular.  Plus, the servers are really hard workers and very pleasant.    Maybe it was just an off night for the chef and my sandwich.  Maybe he was getting a contact-high from all the happiness wafting in from the dining area. Maybe he is related to my gastroenterologist and they were conspiring to get me back for another visit.  Or, maybe Melt is just a regular restaurant that is riding high off the hype of offering something unique in concept, but sometimes lacking in technique.  ...and maybe I sound like a crabby old man.  Now you kids get off my lawn and leave me alone!!!"}
{"text":"I mean, duh, Melt. Too hard to pick a favorite sandwich. Tons and great options, and many that you can make vegetarian and vegan. They used to serve a delicious peppery coleslaw with the sandwiches, and still serve some pretty bomb fries. Portion sizes and huge and they always have a good selection of bottles and drafts."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to visit when I'm back in Cleveland.  My friends and I usually get it to go since the wait is rather long.  I guess I should be giving a bad rating so I can deter others from going... but since I do not live there anymore, have at it, it will be well worth your trip.  My advice, get it to go and re-crisp the toast at home!"}
{"text":"Love going to Melt every time we come to town to visit. The atmosphere is always buzzing and the sandwiches just can't be beat!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Melt.  You are so cute.  You, with your tattoo motif, your Christmas kitsch above the bar.  How did you ever think of making vinyl album covers into menus?  That is so cute.    Where you transcend cute is with your menu, though.  I consider myself a grilled cheese afficionado, and your original take on an American classic is superb.  I couldn't eat everything on my plate when I visited you, but your grilled cheese with portabello mushroom and carmelized onions tasted just dandy when I ate it cold the next day.  Scrum!    Even better was your tomato soup.  Like a mild salsa meets gazpacho.  So chunky and spicy.  Could. Not. Get. Enough.    The waiter you sent us was attentive to me but not to my hubby and bro who got the shaft on drink re-fills.  But that wasn't enough to slight me, for whenever I'm in the town of my birth, you know I'll be melting at the opportunity to see you once more."}
{"text":"Love love love.  Haters gonna hate but Hubby Man and I were very happy with our experience. No wait, fresh and hot food, great service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"being vegan and going out to eat at bar and grill is normally hard but not this place it was awesome had awesome tofu wings and the vegan good burger with vegan cheese the best !! Great service too:)"}
{"text":"They have a new menu! I had gotten bored with their old one so I'm glad. And they are going to have a new one every 3 months (this one is Sept-Nov so next one out Dec1). It has some unique salads.The cold noodle salad is the best I think but also spicy (in a hot Thai chile sense) so be warned if you are spice-averse. The green apple and prosciutto was really good too, especially if you like blue cheese as much as I do.  I remember when the only big salad they had was the roasted veggie one.Their buffalo chicken soup - whether with real chicken or tofu - has a good taste and just right spiciness, but I wish they would cut the tofu into cubes instead of tofu strips too long for a spoon. Pierogies were just perfect.  I'm not a big fan of the sandwiches (heresy!). They are more of a novelty to me. I thought it was fun trying them once or twice and still get enticed by some of the descriptions. I did try the new Shrimp Po Boy, it's mostly hush puppies.  Five stars because this is my favorite place to go tor relax. The dim lights, laid back atmosphere, short wait time (unlike Lakewood...), good beer, always great servers. It's not a place where you feel like they are trying to flip your table. They are keeping the menu interesting even if it's not always a hit. But often it is a hit. I hope they keep up the salad/vegetarian expansion."}
{"text":"Great place. They deliver on the MELT. Always soooooo busy tho."}
{"text":"Ever since Melt opened their Cleveland Heights location just up the street from my house, my boyfriend and I have been semi-regulars, typically dining there about once a month. The food is moderately priced (the two of us can typically get a meal for around $20 total, though the fact that we're non-drinkers likely curbs the overall cost of our dining experience) and the portions are extremely generous. We're typically able to make two meals out of what we order and bring our leftovers home to heat up in a skillet or in the oven. Since Melt makes their grilled cheeses on thick, \"Texas Toast\" style bread, they hold up well to being refrigerated and reheated later on (though I wouldn't recommend hanging on to leftovers for more than a day or so.) Knowing that I can barely make a dent in most of Melt's over-stuffed sandwiches, I often opt for the half combo (a smaller grilled cheese served with a cup of soup and a side salad.) In addition to having some great entrees, Melt also offers a nice selection of appetizers and sides that can be easy to miss out on. Be sure to ask about their soup of the day as they often craft inventive options out of leftover sandwich ingredients (the last time I was there I had a great Dortmunder \"ham and cheddar\" soup.)  There's typically a lengthy wait during peak lunch and dinner hours. Depending on the size or your party, you may be given a wait time of anywhere between one and three hours (I've noticed that they tend to inflate the wait time and occasionally parties find seating at the bar, which is first come first serve, or get fed up and leave, which can shorten the time you spend waiting.) Honestly, I wouldn't recommend dining at Melt with a party larger than four people. Though they do have one very large booth, the restaurant really isn't designed to seat larger parties. It may seem like a fun idea to get a group of friends together for drinks and gourmet grilled cheese, but you'll likely spend several hours waiting only to be grouped together over a constellation of round tables (alternatively, the staff may ask if your party is open to being split up and seated in different areas of the restaurant.) As a duo, my boyfriend and I have had very good luck with short wait times. If there isn't a table for two open, we're typically able to grab seats at the bar within a few minutes of arriving. If you live nearby and don't want to chance a long wait, they do offer carry out.   It's worth noting that Melt is vegetarian and vegan friendly and offers a small selection of vegan cheeses, so don't feel like you have to miss out on the experience of dining at Melt if you're a vegetarian or vegan. In addition to having vegan cheese on hand, they also typically offer a vegetarian or vegan alternative to their monthly special.  The restaurant has a small metered lot accessible from S. Taylor, but if you want to save your quarters there's free parking on neighboring residential streets (just be prepared to walk a block or two.)"}
{"text":"It was a cold Saturday night in March, not much was open past 10 p.m. in this neck of the woods, as far as restaurants go. But, that's where Melt stepped in to save the evening. They're open til 11p.m. in Mentor which is much appreciated. It's a hip place with lots of cool Cleveland nostalgia to gawk at, good specials and a neato soundtrack.   Ray was our late night server. He was very personalable, efficient and took care of us. My hubby and I both got the Gyro Melt. I had mine made vegetarian style, which was tasty. We subbed the tomato soup instead of fries.   My only gripe is that the tomato soup seemed really chunky and undercooked. It was tolerable  but I wouldn't order it again. Other than that, you get a lot of sandwhich for your buck! I'll go back."}
{"text":"Huge portions, unique sandwiches and great fries. Melt also has a very nice beer selection. Definitely would be a go-to if I lived in Cleveland, both for lunch/dinner and late night food on the weekends. The staff couldn't be friendlier either."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for excellent grilled cheese bars (see also Cheesie's in Chicago), and this is one of the best. The expansive menu offers something for everyone. I especially appreciated the complexity of their menu items (it's not just \"we will put anything in between bread\" - their combinations are clearly well thought out).   My sister opted for the potatoes and chorizo, which had nice flavor. I went for the Monte Cristo, which is a DEEP FRIED SANDWICH. It's sort of like the best breakfast doughnut ever. I opted to order a side of maple syrup as well (it comes with a berry sauce that just wasn't my jam, pun not intended).  We ordered fried pickles to start, which were crispy and delicious. That said, we did NOT need an appetizer - both of us could only finish half our sandwiches afterwards. This is from someone who can eat an entire large pizza. These sandwiches are HUGE. Order a half if you're not a BIG eater, and maybe even if you are."}
{"text":"It was OK. I wanted to try out the new location because I had heard so much about Melt. I went with the parmageddon being polish and all. It was just to much bread and pasta and not enough taste. The fries are good like you would get at the fair but nothing new. No kids meal but the kindergartener was big enough for two kids so that worked out. My wife did have the big popper and that was good but a lot of crust. I will say there was a ton of food I took three containers home. The service was not good. She forgot the kids milks and then I waited 10min for a beer to be told that they where out of Melt Light, its their specialty beer. Would I go back.... yes maybe this is just some bugs because it was the first few days they where open. I will try again and report back. Steve"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, nephew and I came to Ohio for a weekend. We saw the reviews of this bar and made a stop. My daughter ordered Cleveland cheese steak and asked for gravy on her fries. My nephew ordered the Backyard BBQ. My husband ordered chorizo and potato. I ordered the Dude Abides (meatballs, marinara sauce and mozzarella wedges). Let's just say unless you came here straight after being rescued from a deserted island, you won't have room for appetizers AND a meal. You get a lot of food! I am unsure about those who gave this place anything less than 5 stars. They must have come on an off day. Dinner and drinks for four adults was under $70.  This is a highly recommend place from me. The staff was very friendly and attentive and extremely down to earth. They have 3 locations."}
{"text":"Walking in to the restaurant, which is glowing with all kinds of old and new light-up objects, all you can smell is the aroma of cheese in the air! How can it get any better than that?? I was expecting our wait to be crazy long (like the original Melt), but I was pleasantly surprised when my name was called after only about 20 minutes. We were led to our table and given the menus which were on old record sleeve (cool!) There were tons of beers and drinks to choose from, and I got the electric blueberry lemonade while my friends tried different pumpkin spiced beers- All were delicious.    For my meal, I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese sandwich and oh my goodness was it tasty! The blue cheese crumbles paired perfectly with the buffalo sauce, and the whole sandwich reminded me of buffalo chicken dip.  The fries are outstanding (not too much salt and not at all soggy). I took half of the behemoth home to enjoy the next day and was just as pleased with the leftovers as I was with the meal the day I was there... Can't go wrong with double the pleasure!   If I had one complaint, it would be that it was a little loud and the tables were pretty close together so we could overhear everyone else's conversations... Not really a big deal though... Overall a really enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"Welcome to the most over rated restaurant in Cleveland. Lakewood, rather. This is not a locals spot. It's a spot where suburbanites with inferiority complexes take their douchebag friends. Walk in and treat yourself to an Applebees corporate vibe complete with  plastic made in China \"antique\" gas pump and wait an hour around other douches to eat a $12 sandwich that is 6 inches of bread and a nauseating kamikaze of whatever the hell the cook had lying around in the middle. I bet these same friends will take you to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame afterwards. LOL. Don't apologize for my city with this gimmicky bs, you yuppie scum. Go to the East Side and eat at Jacks if you want a real sandwich, or Slymans if you can handle the sight of homeless people, smokestacks, and trash. If that bothers you, gtfo!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. Any time I'm in Ohio, I try to stop at a Melt Bar & Grilled location. TBH like I would drive to Ohio just for their melts. My go to is the Korean War Pig with extra cheese, but honestly you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Huge portions, relaxed atmosphere, creative menu, and reasonable prices. Melt is by far my favorite place to take out of towners visiting Cleveland for all these reasons."}
{"text":"All I have to say is if you live or visit Ohio you must go to a melt-it's phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service was horrific, the worst I ever have had in my life. They said the wait was 2 hours for a table, then 45 minutes for a sandwich order...  The people were next to nasty in terms of business etiquette."}
{"text":"Came here twice while in Cleveland on business after seeing it on TV.    Really enjoyed everything I had here.  Sat at the bar for immediate seating and received great service.  Opted for the loaded fries the first time but it was just tooooo much for me so took the regular fries my second trip lol.  They also have a great selection of vegetarian and vegan options.  Mostly everything (with a few exceptions) on the menu can be customized to accommodate us veg-heads.  To top it all of, fun selection of beers also.     Looking forward to my next business outing up to Cleveland so I can cheese out again!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the great hype machine from MvF, tourists from near and far are drawn like moths to a flame. This review is waaay longer than usual because we were a table of four and I don't know when I'll be in town again.   I'm psyched that this bar offers an impressive variety of craft beers and signature drinks. I just stuck to one: Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold. It's not available back home and I enjoyed...hmm...maybe four+ pints? Just the right thing while lounging in the bar between scenes from Labyrinth (1986 Jennifer Connelly & David Bowie) on TV and chatting before your table is ready. I would be happy to eat at the bar just the same.   We started with the Melt Peirogi: two large doughy pockets with creamy potato and cheese filling, topped with a healthy dollop of sour cream, sprinkled with shredded cheese, green onion (but the menu says grilled onion), and \"napa vodka kraut\". I'm not familiar with nvk, but it was ok...reminded me of chopped, sauteed cabbage in balsamic vinaigrette. A good starter to share.   Next was my side salad. I was actually impressed that the \"small\" bowl had a generous amount of fresh greens accompanied by julienned red peppers, sliced cucumber, and crumbled feta. I'm getting full between the beers, pierogi bites, and the salad.   After mulling the possibilities, my final selection is the Municipal Stadium Magic. I originally wanted to try a Polish po boy while I was in town, but ran out of time (I'm hoping hoping hoping to make at least one final stop before my airline flight). The bratwurst in my sammy was dee-lish along with the blend of nvk, peppers, and smooth melty cheese between the signature thick slices of buttery, grilled bread.   So my cousins ordered extra fries instead of the cole slaw. I enjoy the texture and crunch that cabbage adds, but my slaw was dry (meh!) and the small scoop seemed more like a garnish, overshadowed by the massive breadwich and heap o' fries.   Two of the cousins talk about trying something different on the menu, but they always order the same: Melt Burger & Fat City Burger. Both looked meaty and delicious. My other cousin tried something different: BBQ Chicken. She didn't care much for the sweet BBQ sauce. She said it tasted like BBQ potato chips. I took a bite and agreed that the sauce seemed similar to bottled KC Masterpiece from the grocery store.   Our waitress was friendly and came by several times to check on us for drink refills. No room for dessert this time, but I hear they're pretty good too.   This moth would gladly return if the opportunity presented itself."}
{"text":"There are over a hundred and fifty reviews for Melt already, but I feel the need to share my thoughts! In list form...  YAY! 1. Grilled cheese mecca! The menu* is famous for its intensity, but even the basic \"kindergartener\" sandwiches (I suggest smoked gouda!) are delicious. *The menus are also printed on the back of album covers. Fun. 2. Unique atmosphere and decor inside. You will never run out of things to look at. 3. I always have leftovers. Half a sandwich and a mountainous pile of fries is more than enough for me. 4. A great beer selection--especially during pumpkin ale season!  BOO! 1. There can be an hour+ wait if you show up at the wrong times. Prepare for an especially long wait if you go during the weekend, especially Saturday or Sunday night. 2. The bar tends to run out of the best beers on tap during busy times. (Pumpking on Halloween weekend, I'm talking to you. Actually, EVERY pumpkin beer AND Octoberfest AND everything else I tried to order that weekend, I'm talking to you.) 3. If I go to the gym the same day I go to Melt, I regret doing anything healthy for myself earlier in the day. The \"blahhhh, so bad and SO good\" effects Melt has on me more than cancels anything healthy I did for myself that day. If this doesn't happen to you, tell me your secrets.  4. If you order a sandwich to go, CHECK IT BEFORE YOU GET HOME. The only time I did this, they gave me a completely different sandwich, and as it turned out, one that I couldn't even force myself to eat because it had all of my least favorite meats and ingredients on it. --This is the reason I gave Melt 4 stars rather than 5. I threw that sandwich in the trash and it was too late to go back and exchange it for another.  TIPS: 1. Park on a side street rather than at a meter. There are sneaky ways to avoid paying for parking! 2. Go for an early or late lunch on a weekday to avoid the wait.   I SUGGEST YOU TRY: 1. Bringing your out-of-town friends here. It is a good Cleveland experience.  2. The November sandwich of the month. It involves turkey, stuffing, butternut squash, and a cranberry sauce for dipping. Thanksgiving in a grilled cheese sandwich. 3. The BBQ chicken sandwich. 4. The brussel sprouts, as a side. I'm not sure if this is a regular menu item or just a reoccurring side special. 5. The spinach pie sandwich."}
{"text":"I am not reviewing Melt in general, but rather this location. I live on the East side so I frequent the Cleveland Heights location. If you've never been to Melt, stop reading reviews and get over there! It will change your life, and you will be amazed at how big one sandwich can be.   The Independence Melt is so small! I went there on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30 and we had to wait for an hour and a half just to get a table. My advice is to avoid weekend afternoons and evenings unless you truly don't mind waiting. And at this location, it's a crowded wait.  Otherwise, typical Melt deliciousness. Don't eat more than half your sandwich unless you want to feel terrible about yourself."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. For the price I thought it would be better. And they over cooked it. So it was like big bread, with a hockey puck. The combination of toppings I think was a great Idea. But where is the good beef. eeek I would go to the bumpers down the road. For cheap burgers and  beer."}
{"text":"Be hungry if you come here.  Also, be prepared to be super full when you leave.  The place is a cash cow.  How could anyone not love fried cheese?  Last time I was there I had a sandwich that I think was called a Monte Cristo.  It was huge, I think it was dipped in something, and then the entire thing tasted like it was fried, served with a light sprinkling of powdered sugar and a reduction raspberry sauce for dipping.  Well, I had to sleep off that sandwich, but it was a slice of heaven for my taste.  I have no idea if they have desserts as their sandwiches are simply overwhelmingly huge and toothsome."}
{"text":"I Love this place!!! I've tried several of the sammy's and I love them all. So many different options to add, subtract or modify; you've got to make several trips and try a bunch. They also have amazing soups and salads!"}
{"text":"Good food that will put you in a food coma. Seating can be a little cramped, but all is well when you taste this heavenly food."}
{"text":"The Situation:   Lunchtime at work, no one wants to leave because there is so much work left to be done. I left my phone at home. \"Hey all, I'm heading to Lakewood to get my phone. Who wants Melt?\" Everyone came running to give me there order.   I called it in for take out. 9 Sandwiches with only a 45minute wait time at 1pm. Definitely a plus for work lunch. Melt called me when the sandwiches were ready and I headed to pick up. I received a club card to get a $20 gift cert when I spend $100. Awesome! (I was 3/4 of the way there with that single order) Walked in the backdoor, paid and picked up within minutes. No wait. The nice girl at the counter sent me on my way with 3 bags full of sandwiches and all the condiments we could ever hope for.   My Portabello and cheese was delicious! Everyone else at the office was extremely satisfied. I'll have to try dining in at some point based on the reviews.   Definitely try it if you haven't. And definitely keep going if you like it."}
{"text":"Overall was a good experience. Went on a Friday night at 5pm. No wait and bar was completely open. Was there during happy hour drinks were stiff  and the boneless wi ha were great. The staff was not as involved as I would have like. But overall a good experience $$-$$$"}
{"text":"Went here one night when it was snowing pretty hard so the place was practically empty, which was nice. The server at the bar area was exceptionally nice and pretty much made our night.   We ordered the cuban sandwich and the cleveland sandwich, both full sized. The sandwiches came with a pickle and a ton of fries. The bread was a thick piece of sourdough bread. It was tasty but way too oily.   The Cuban: I enjoyed the sandwich but it was just way too dry. There is a LOT of meat in the sandwich which is great for meatlovers, but I'm sure nobody likes a dry sandwich.   The Cleveland sandwich: This one was pretty tasty. It didn't taste like a normal cheese steak to me because it was drenched in a sweet sauce. I really liked this sandwich though it does get too heavy to eat a lot of.   Food wise 3/5 but +1 for excellent service. 4/5"}
{"text":"Best Grilled Cheese sandwiches (okay their is a lot more than cheese there) in town.  Exceedingly inventive sandwiches on very tasty bread with lots of protein and veggie options to put into your sandwich.   My only complaint ...they are way too big (not so bad).  BTW their salads are actually excellent and their Balsamic is very, very good.  Be prepared to wait at any of their three locations at lunch and dinner .. but worth the wait and they have a really nice bar at all locations.  A Cleveland Classic"}
{"text":"Ok .. this gets a 4 from me ,but only because of our server who was fun and fantastic . The food still leaves a lot to be desired . It used to be so good consistently..and packed anytime o was there ..there were so many empty tables ."}
{"text":"So this is an excellent place of you're starving and a bad place if you're try to impress someone. MASSIVE portions of slightly greasy (in a good way) bread and french fried. You can order it anyway you want! I got chorizo and potatoes. It was fantastic.  The interior is very interesting and eclectic. Our waitress was really friendly. I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Had the big poppa with bacon!!!! TO DIE FOR!!!! Money well spent...the atmosphere was great and brings back childhood memories"}
{"text":"What can I say that 364 other people haven't said already? Okay, how about this: vegetarian food. I really appreciate that there are so many vegan-friendly and vegetarian offers on the menu, and their chili is also vegan-friendly.  Okay, so I decided to go here on the advice of a friend who lives in the area. She was spot-on... this was a great choice and exactly the atmosphere that I needed on a cold night after arriving in Cleveland.  The chili was pleasant, although it could have been warmer. I liked the serving size for a cup of chili, and the mug approach to serving the chili was the perfect size. I ordered a half sandwich, and was pleased with the size of the portion (Goldilocks would think it was just right) and the flavors. If I get a chance, I will definitely visit there again."}
{"text":"I've had Melt several times (all but one before the expansion and tv appearances so you could still get in and just sit down) and although the sandwiches were good, it's over hyped. After they were on tv, I placed a phone order to pick up some sandwiches and was told 40 minutes to pick up. So after 40 minutes I got there and waited another 45 minutes. TO PICK UP GRILLED CHEESE. It's just not worth it with all the amazing other places around the westside.    I just can't give them more stars when the service is so bad. Kudos to the melt team for becoming a tourist hot spot, hopefully when that dies down it will find a local customer base to stick around."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times and Melt has never failed to miss it's mark. The wet hot buffalo and backyard bar-b-q;.. both awesome! I may be one in a small crowd of odd palettes, but i truly miss the slaw... it was always the first thing I went for on my plate. However, the consistency and quality remain to make this place a winner every time. (I have tried the slaw since it being removed from the new menu and it was not the same) Try something new!"}
{"text":"Do I crave Melt, no. But do I always suggest taking out of towners here, yes.  It is the Cleveland staple.  It has a cool atmosphere, fun staff, great beers on tap and something for everyone on the menu.  I just don't love it and can never finish my meal and never find myself wanting my leftovers.   I have tried many sandwiches here, even soups and salads.  None are bad, but my favorite has been this shrimp one.  (I just tried to find the name of it on the menu and I couldn't.  I hope they didn't get rid of it!) It has sauteed shrimp, with cheese of course, a type of lettuce/slaw and a sauce that really pulls it all together.  It is really good and the shrimp is cooked very well.    Their fries are delicious and I love their coleslaw but you will never be able to finish your meal.  But if you can, high five!  I have also been here for brunch once, for the state I was in it was way to heavy!  At 11 AM I did not want eggs inside two huge thick pieces of toast and french fries, but their bloody mary's were spot on! Delicious! Would go back and have them any time, not just for brunch.  I would give it another shot if I wanted more of a lunch than a breakfast.    I say check it out.  You will not be disappointed, your meal will be hot and fresh, you just won't talk about it after you leave. You'll have a good time and leave very full!"}
{"text":"Every time we pass through Cleveland, Melt is a must!  Loved this location! We were seating quickly, the restaurant was clean and staff was friendly and attentive.   Food was delicious! Never disappointed!   My husband ordered the monte cristo . It came looking like a yummy tower of goodness! So much that the table next to us asked what we ordered lol. I ordered the wet buffalo I believe ....   it was so good.. tasted just like a chicken wing !   Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to Melt !!!"}
{"text":"I would rather eat dog food than pay for Texas toast with whatever cheese and meats on it."}
{"text":"A grilled cheese bar? Heavenly.  Tons of vegetarian options. I went with a Godfather. It was awesome.   I got a meal out of each half of the sandwich. This did leave me feeling pretty gross afterwards."}
{"text":"Strange place menu way too confusing u need to pass a test to order very weird dont think ill b back"}
{"text":"**Updated 1-Dec-10**  I've visited Melt 5 times total, including the day of the original review.  The last 3 times my sandwiches were greasy, and all 3 made me sick.  The second time I visited, my sandwich (mushroom melt,) didn't make me sick, but it didn't have much taste, either.  The other sandwiches I ordered were the Prime Time Prime Rib, the Guitar Gyro and Mom's Meatloaf.  The prime rib and gyro *tasted* good, but again, the bread was very greasy.  The meatloaf sandwich had very little flavor, and the bread was also greasy.  I'm not sure if it was the grease which made me sick or something else, but I haven't been back to Melt since early October.  When I'm paying over $10 for a sandwich, I'd like to not be sick the rest of the evening and into the next day.  Due to these experiences, I've updated my star rating to reflect my disappointment.  I originally gave them 4 stars, but knocked them down to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Stop it with the tattoos. Really. Nobody cares if you're \"tattoo brother 79\" and you get free GRILLED CHEESE 4 LIFE. What's worse is the people that actually tattoo that exact phrase on their arms. Or is it 25% off? Whatever. Who cares?! Either way, it's ridiculous.   I know someone who did this to himself. I didn't have the heart to tell him that he was an IDIOT.  disclaimer: I love tattoos. I'm obsessed with them. I just find this sort of promotional BS a tad bit gross."}
{"text":"Had to make this one of our stops on our weekend visit to Cleveland after looking up places on diners, drive ins, and dives. Let's just say well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Yum, yum and yum!  I travel 100% for my job, so I am always trying new restaurants.  This was my first trip to the Cleveland area, and when I asked my client for a restaurant recommendation, this was the first on their list for me to try.  I'm so glad they did!  I think the concept of this restaurant is so cool!  I've been in Cleveland three nights, and two of them were spent eating at Melt.  I have two future trips planned back to the area, and I'll definitely be in for more.  So far, I've had the Wake and Bacon and the Kindergarten, and both were absolutely delish.  The tomato soup is clearly homemade; a little gritty and a lot tasty.  I've also had the bread pudding both nights, and it is really, really good.  Overall, a great restaurants with a ton of variations of the grilled cheese that I can't wait to keep eating my way through.  Go here; you'll like it!"}
{"text":"YES.  One of the best ideas ever.  Gourmet grilled cheese, but don't let the concept fool you - this ain't some kinda candy-ass art nouveau sahnd-weech shop.  These are real sammies for real appetites.  Sammies that you can't finish at lunch or dinner but you look at it and think \"this is going to be so great at 3 a.m.\"  Totally unnecessary.  Utter bliss.  Served with really, really great fries, fresh-cut style and just a lil' soggy.  Get the honey-tomato-chipotle sauce on the side for those.  Trust me, just get it.  And to help keep you somewhat healthy, coleslaw comes with the sammies dressed in oil and vinegar, not laden with Marzetti's or whatever.  My most recent experience was The Godfather -  a lasagna sandwich.  A LASAGNA SANDWICH.  Delicious, sweet and savory lasagna by itself, but Melt puts it IN the garlic bread...wow.  I have also had the Big Popper, a jalapeno popper sandwich (A JALAPENO POPPER SANDWICH) with berry sauce (how it *should* be), the Spinach Pie and the Mushroom Melt - trying to get my veggies in there somehow.  I'd love to try appetizers someday but who has the room for that?  I'd also love to try the salads but why would I?  I've been here for brunch and it was also amazing - just imagine your sandwich mixed up with eggs instead of bread.  Melt also has an extensive beer list, including lots of domestics and imports.  The service here is always friendly and attentive.  You will wait a while to be seated, but you will be so happy when you eat your sammie that you won't even remember how long it took.  I will always recommend Melt to anyone living in or visiting Cleveland, and it will always be a must-do when I visit.  MELT - come to NYC - preferably BKLYN, there is nothing like you in the five boroughs!"}
{"text":"The Melt Ohio Tuesday December 27, 2011 Three Stars  We walked into this great grilled cheese place, filled with murals of musicians, light-up holiday displays, broken glass sculpture windows, and decent 90s rock music.  We made our way past two dozen people to get to the hostess station and she says that it is going to be a 2 hour wait for a party of two.  I said forget it, but my bold girlfriend scouted out two people leaving at the bar and swoop those seats within three minutes of getting of there.  Our waiter John was absolutely amazing: attentive, fun, friendly, and knowledgeable.  He told us that it would take 45 minutes to get our sandwiches from the time we order them.  We scoped out the menus, which were on the back of vinyl album cases.  We decided to go bold and ordered: Erie Sea Monster (Beer Battered Walleye & Jalapeno Tartar Sauce) & Purple Parma (Breaded eggplant, grilled tomato, sun-dried tomato pesto, provolone cheese).  After we ordered food, we were enjoyed a beverage from their selection of 40 draft beers: Great Divide Hibernation and Winterbach.  We also ordered their tomato soup: it came out immediately.  The soup tasted almost like pasta sauce but in a good way.  It was served with a mound of cheese and gold fish crackers, which was a nice touch.  As we waited for our melts, we stared into the kitchen and noticed that no one had any sense of urgency. After 30 minutes, our food came out, kind of cold and very disappointing.  The Sea Monster: The breading was thick, lack flavor, fell off the fish.  The fish itself was a large delicious piece of walleye but it had no seasoning at all.  The Grilled Cheese portion was excellent, but cheese and fish are not a great combination (especially here).  Purple Parma:  The breading was soggy and seemed to be cooked a couple hours ahead of time.  The flavor was so-so, but the thick bread and melted cheese was tasty.  My advice: sit at the bar, order something plain and drink a lot of good beer."}
{"text":"The tall blonde waitress was attentive and polite. She was quick to serve us and get our check when the time came. She wasn't overly bothersome like some waitresses are. I'd say she was perfect. She's the reason I gave this place 4 stars, but if I was rating on food alone (and the floors, more later) I'd give them a 3.  Atmosphere was noisy. Place is big with lots of seating at the bar and lots of tables. Bunch of sports on the big screens.  Lots of interesting grilled cheeses on the menu. Fries were pretty good. Salted nicely. Skin on. Good tomato soup.  For $2 more you can get your sandwich bettered and deep fried. I would advise against that. It ruined my sandwich. First, the whole sandwich wasn't battered, just the two slices if bread. Second, they were doughy.  I had a small glass of beer and it was $7.50! Had I have known that I would not have got it. I could get a whole microbrew 6 pack for that price.  Be careful when you walk in. The floors are like a bowling alley. Sliiiiipery! I almost fell twice as did my friend."}
{"text":"Love it! I had the Cleveland cheesesteak. It had the most amazing cheese sauce! Yum!! I was at the Fairlawn location"}
{"text":"Visited on vacation to Cleveland area.  First, the vibe was ok.  Trying too hard to be kitschy and instead it was just odd and dumb to have 50 or so retro light up holiday lawn decorations.  Also wasn't a fan of the large signs that just weren't as cool as the designer probably hoped it would be.  Great selection of beers and cider.  Mixed drinks were awful.  Margarita was sent back, organic pear something or other was equally awful.  Tasted like fruit juice concentrate.  Stick to the beer and cider.  Waitress was so not helpful or interested in sharing about the concept and selections to us non-locals.  Food was pretty fantastic.  No complaints there.  The kindergarten (their take on a traditional grilled cheese) was amazing.  The mac and cheese wedges were out of this world.  Buffalo tofu was spectacular.  The restaurant has a generous vegetarian and vegan selection as well as gluten free options.  Overall it's a great choice for food, not for the experience or a drink."}
{"text":"Oh how I WISH there was a Melt Bar & Grill in Los Angeles! At least this gives me another excuse to comeback to OH. Being a \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" watcher, I had to check this place out during our mini-vacation out there.  The only negative was the long-ass wait. Not sure if you can call ahead and get your name down before you show up - but I'd try it anyway. We were told that the wait would be 1.5hours - luckily we only waited 45mins, so not too bad.  I ordered the BBQ Chicken and Ben F. ordered the Godfather (a.k.a. Carb town! He wished it had meat in it, but what can you do). Both were delicious! The bread was hearty but didn't kill the roofs of our mouths. No flavors were overpowering the others. We ordered the yummy garlic-tomato soup to share - it was more sauce-y than soupy. The fries that come with your sandwich are wonderfully seasoned and crispy and the ranch dressing we requested on the side was excellent as well.  Like I said, aside from the wait, I loved this place - heavily decorated in rockin' kitsch and showing fun movies on their tv screens. Parking wasn't too hard to find on a weeknight either. The service was nice also. Definitely gonna hit this place up again whenever we return to Ohio!"}
{"text":"Visited last weekend while in Cleveland to watch the Tigers stomp the Indians.  I did pre-read some of the other reviews, and I can't figure out where some of the hate is coming from! This place is fantastic!  Yes, there was a 45-60min wait, but I expected that for a Saturday afternoon crowd. This place is popular for a reason folks!  The service was very good. The host was very friendly, had tons of personality and gladly provided me with a menu and beer list while we waited... I've been scoffed at numerous times at other places when making the same request. He joked a lot with the other people waiting and it shows that he really cared about your experience. Our server was much the same; very friendly, attentive, accommodating, and he was just as patient with us as were with them while we waited. This is a rarity, the service was very, very good.  The food was spectacular; generous portions, and everything was priced fairly. Simple ingredients and quality bread combined to make fantastic and unique sandwiches... and there were MOUNDS OF FRESH CUT FRENCH FRIES with each order AND MALT VINEGAR at each table! Score!   Let me explain... Hand cut fries are a rarity, but they're such a simple staple that can make any menu 100% better. The fry thing may sound weird, but McDonald's has somehow convinced Americans that their frozen shoestring fries are the end all of the french fry world. Not true, don't buy into that garbage. Hand cut fries are where it's at. You take a potato, you cut it, you soak it in water, you fry it, drain the basket and fry again for a few seconds. Easy, cheap, delicious. Why don't more places do this??  The beer list was pretty amazing and again, priced very fair. I don't want prices to increase or anything, but I would have paid $1 - $1.50 more per beer. Kudos for whoever made and priced this beer list, you did a great job!  I have zero complaints. Sure we waited a while, but I expected to wait as I've read how popular Melt has become. Melt is operating like a restaurant should. They're doing things right! Great food, more than reasonable prices excellent hires, fantastic beer list. Why can't more places operate like this? The folks at Melt are keeping things simple, and it's obviously working.  The next time I'm even close to Cleveland, I'm stopping in at Melt, and you should to!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved from out of state and recently came here for lunch after it was recommended to us by just about every person we know. Gotta say, we were pretty dissapointed. While the food was good we were expecting more cheesey deliciousness and really this was more like a place that makes really big hot sandwhiches that all happen to have a slice or two of cheese on it. The food was decent enough, as was the beer; I think we were just really let down after so much build up.  Will we come back? Maybe if we want to bring some visitors here to check it out. But I think we are not going to make it a regular thing.  Also, the bathroom was pretty gross."}
{"text":"This is probably a must visit! Me and my family being vegetarian had tons of options and ended up with loads of leftover. Ee probably should have refrained from ordering a starter which was delicious and filling and should have gone for a half order of the sandwich instead of a full. Overall - get atmosphere, busy crowd so be sure to arrive 30 min before u get hungry, great food!!!! I had no issues with service and got my food on time!!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously busy at all times (good for the owners & the servers though, right?!!)  for my first time there, it was definitely worth the wait... though I may only go when I am back in town and taking other first timers with me.  Special occasion type stuff.    At times, though, Melt feels like the hot guy you had a crush on for, like, ever... only to find out he's all pretty/no gritty.  He just kinda lays there being awesome and you should thank him for the privilege of waiting 4 hours for him to come by for a booty call.  The food, however, is pretty awesome and usually worth the wait.    AND they were all too happy to deal with food allergies for those of us that needed special food handling.  If you are celiac or have a gluten allergy, they'll let you bring in your own bread for one of their yummy sandwiches... because that's what ya came here for, isnt it??? :)"}
{"text":"Just went again for Father's Day with the family. Have been to this location many time, just decided to write a review. Sandwiches are great, just a couple comments.   1. Fries are always limp. I don't know what they do to them, but they are always limp and a bit greasy. Every time I have been there that is the way they are. I just don't eat them, but there are not any real better options.   2. The noise level is always high.  3. They charge extra for some silly stuff. This last time my dad got a side of tartar sauce. They charged $0.75 for a little cup. Like a tablespoon or two worth. After spending well over $100 on dinner one would think it would be gratis.   Besides those comments the sandwiches are super and totally worth the trip and the money.  Will be back again, my daughter loves the Kindergartner with American."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the portions are massive! We went to this place for lunch when we were in Cleveland for a wedding. I got the Monte Cristo- it was huge, but so delicious! I can't wait to come back to Cleveland and try some more of their unique options!"}
{"text":"Three of us went here for lunch during the week.  Not that many people were seated.  Took over 45 mins to get our food.  Staff didn't seem to care.  Food was sitting in the window getting cold.  The bread was way too big for the sandwich.  The food and fries were cold, and they were definitely not worth the wait.  The restaurant was nicely decorated with signs.  There were not enough tv's for a bar.  Nice concept, but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I visited Melt with my parents about a week ago on a weekday night.  First of all, let me just say that everyone who helped us in the restaurant was wonderful. Our server was pleasant and attentive and must have refilled my water glass ten times.   At first glance on the menu, I was happy to see greater than 10 vegetarian options.  I ordered the jalapeño popper sandwich, and it came with an order of French fries. The sandwich itself was good for me but not great. The portion was sizable (I eat a ton and ended up taking half of my sandwich home), but the sandwich itself was not inordinately pleasing to me. It was deep fried (which, yes, was on the menu) and just didn't sit well with me. That being said, their jam they serve alongside it for dipping was delicious.  Considering the portions, the pricing was appropriate.  Overall, while I think the food was good, it was not great. Perhaps next time I visit Melt I'll just get a salad; their salads are huge. However, I think my stomach needs a break from the grease ball I deposited while I was here!"}
{"text":"If I didn't get wicked heart-burn after eating here (my stomach can't handle what it used to!), I would probably be here all the time!   The creativity and wildness that is on this menu is wonderful! I had the After School Special, and when they say \"fried thick cut bologna,\" they aren't fooling around! It was at least 1/2 in thick! Yum! And it all melded perfectly with the sweet & spicy pickles and house made ketchup chips! What a unique place!"}
{"text":"Interesting place, beer good and cold. Sandwiches are nothing to brag about, the only good thing was the Mac & Cheese bites. So now I can say been there, never again."}
{"text":"Is it worth the trip, well yes. Melt is the grilled cheese experience. Sandwiches are great, stacked high and very filling. Choices are endless and it is a bar and the choices of beer are very good. We loved this place and made a special trip from Detroit on my wife's birthday just for melt."}
{"text":"I had the Korean War Pig was fabulous.  Loved the flavor of the Kim chi with the pork.  Will definitely go to the Akron location when it opens."}
{"text":"With all the hype about Melt, I expected something spectacular.  What I got was slow service, flat Diet Coke, and a giant but very bland sandwich.  When I told the waitress that the soda was flat, she offered to bring another but said that the new one probably wouldn't be any better.    After poring over the quite remarkable array of creative grilled cheese offerings, I selected the roasted vegetable one, which had muenster cheese and \"sun-dried tomato pesto\" (more on that later).  I almost ordered the \"popper\" melt instead, but it had raw jalapenos instead of cooked, and I wasn't up for that kind of pain.  Does anyone really prefer raw jalapenos?  The thick-cut bread and gobs of melted cheese on my sandwich completely over-powered the sad little chunks of squash, zucchini, and eggplant.  A roasted veggie sandwich needs veggies with some flavor, such as red peppers and onions, so the sandwich was basically doomed from the start.  In addition, the \"pesto\" tasted like tomato sauce.  I also sampled some of the pierogi melt, which wasn't bad but who really needs a pierogi inside of a grilled cheese sandwich?  Overall, Melt seems heavy on concept and low on deliciousness."}
{"text":"Plain a SIMPLE great food. If you are on a diet, do not eat here! Yummy in my tummy time!!!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought such a simple concept would be such a hit, grilled cheese sandwiches!!! Well I am a fan of MELT and let me say it's simply awesome. I use to go to the original one in Lakewood until Matt opened one in Cleveland Heights. I will be honest, I don't care what you get here, it's all good! One day I ordered a balsamic mushroom and onion grilled cheese sandwich with green bean soup  and I though I was in heaven. Another plus is that this place has perfected  french fries. The atmosphere is cool and laid back. I can't say anything but great things about MELT restaurants. If your in Cleveland or Columbus go to MELT, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time being there and loved the heck out of my sandwich! Best Cole slaw and great fries. Will go back! Couldn't give a five star because they gave us the wrong beer. Then asked for it back or we would have to pay for it! The catch: they saw us drink the beers........ they weren't going to serve them to anyone else? Right?.....hopefully!"}
{"text":"I had a great visit here while I was on a company trip. Would make a stop here if I was nearby again."}
{"text":"Melt Bar and Grilled made our list as a destination restaurant based on word of mouth and some celebrity exposure. We started off with the \"hangover fries\", which were tasty and unique. My only complaint was that we found precious little of the advertised seared pork belly in it. I thought the selection of appetizers was a bit sparse.  I loved their beer selection, and had a tasty local brew as did my companion.  For my sandwich, I ordered \"The Dude Abides\". It was really great when it first came out, with good flavor and hot and gooey cheese - but could have used more basil marinara sauce on it (it was a bit dry).  Since I didn't wolf it down in moments, the cheese wedges became kind of hard and the sandwich became borderline inedible. The meatballs on it were incredibly dry and didn't have much flavor. My companion had another of the grilled cheese sandwiches, and it was good but not super memorable.  Our server was pleasant. The atmosphere was rowdy and loud, which I definitely appreciate at times, but patrons should be aware and expect it.  If this place was local and I just happened upon it, it may have scored four stars. But with all the hype and having designated an out of town evening to trying it, Melt will stay relegated to a memory the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My second stop in Cleveland. By now I have noticed a big theme of make your own/ build your own entree.  We came as a party of three and were quickly seated. My friend told me this was definitely a local stop and the people I had talked to that are from Cleveland also mentioned it as well. I think I would best describe this place as huge grilled cheese sandwiches with a twist.  Scanning through the menu you could see a whole slew of different  style grilled cheeses, from cheese steak to meatloaf to jumbo cod on a grilled cheese?!  The whole take is pretty different from a classic grilled cheese sandwich.   We ended up ordering the cheese steak and the chicken and waffle grilled cheese.  In my honest opinion, the sandwiches were pretty decent, but it was because we had a cheese steak and chicken and waffles. I didn't really get the grilled cheese vibe from either of them and the chicken and waffles didn't mix to me like they usually do.  However the environment was fun and the wait staff were friendly and attentive.  I would come back for the concept and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Terrible service from hostess and waiter. Walked out. Should never have to wait when there are many empty tables."}
{"text":"Great food, outstanding beer selection. Unnecessarily long wait time."}
{"text":"Wow! I'd eat here daily, if I could. I should have ordered a half sandwich. The whole could feed 2 people easily. Every variant of grilled cheese you can imagine. I need to try a few more. It was a long time to actually get food but the mature tap list helped a ton and it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow....I need a nap after all that! Had buffalo chicken chowder that was delicious. It had like a light blue cheese broth, not too rich, and chunks of celery and carrots and banana peppers, sooo good. Then had fried mozzarella wedges that came with fig balsamic spread and jalepeno marmalade. As a meal we had the dude abides, and the chorizo and potatoes grilled cheese sandwiches. Everything tasted good. We say at the bar, the bartender was very friendly, and you could tell her knew what he was doing and really liked the food himself."}
{"text":"Awesome place with Giant grilled cheese sandwiches! So many different flavors and you can do half with some soup!"}
{"text":"One word: Yum. Visited Cleveland for my boyfriends birthday and this was the first place we went. Walked right in and sat down. Had a great specialty drink and devoured a sandwich. Fries were also amazing!! Would make a day trip just to eat here again."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffle grilled cheese is THE best. One of my favorite restaurants... Even though they always give me way more food than I can eat. Not a bad thing though."}
{"text":"Melt remains one of my go-to restaurants when I am in this part of Cleveland about every other month or so.  Creative sandwiches with unique flavors and, of course, lots of cheese.  At lunchtime, things get crowded pretty quickly so either go early or be prepared to wait for a table.  The shopping center that Melt is in has a Panera and DiBella's Subs in it as well, but don't despair because there is plenty of extra parking in the back with rear entrances for your convenience.  My table mate got the Korean War Pig today and - as an update to my previous review - shared that the mole was not overpowering.  Perhaps the chef on my previous visit just had a heavy hand.  My Monte Cristo was its usual delicious self.  I am also excited to share that Melt has brought back 1/2 sandwiches.  The reality is that no human needs to consume a whole melt sandwich in one meal if they want to have any hope of being able to actually walk out of the restaurant under their own power so do yourself a favor and act like the whole sandwich option in the menu does not even exist.  Melt deserves the hype and is worth your visit."}
{"text":"If you don't have a hearty appetite, this isn't the place for you.    I had the sausage and kale soup plus the Cleveland Cheesestake and fries.  First the soup was great!  It came in a tall coffee mug.  Great flavor with lots of kale.    The Cleveland Cheesesteak . . . cheesy, cheesy, cheesy!!!  The beef was tender and the sandwich was huge!"}
{"text":"We've seen it on TV and wondered if it would live up to the hype. It did and then some! We had the Tokyo Tuna, Monte Christo & PB&banana, we loved all three. The fries and slaw were also excellent. We will be back!!  Oh and we had NO wait! It was noon on a Thursday and  we thaught we'd have a lunch crowd to contend with, but NO! :)"}
{"text":"My nachos were ready and on the counter for about 10 minutes before another server bought them to us because ours was talking to other servers. They barely have any toppings and cheese. Waffle on chicken and waffle sandwich was cold and hard. Pretty disappointed"}
{"text":"Blagh. The ratio of bread+breading+sugar versus meat on the Monte Cristo was completely unpalatable. I ended up taking it apart and throwing most of it away. Marinara sauce on the dude abides was a saving grace: I could mop up that stuff with anything.  Beer selection was fun."}
{"text":"I can never finish my entree when buying from here or Melt U @ Tinkham. Large portion size (it better be for that hefty price) plus some decent quality fries. I got the Cleveland philly cheese steak sandwich. Kind waitresses who like conversation, service was adequate in terms of speed, and ambience was more bar-like than college sandwich shop-like (as expected)."}
{"text":"Let's set the scene. It was a Saturday during holiday season. After a day of visiting craft shows with my sister in Ohio City and Lakewood, starving we decided to brave the blizzard and head over to Melt to meet her friends for dinner. Rumor Rumor Rumor: soooo yummy you will not be disappointed!   We got there first and put in our hour-2hr reservation for a table. Yikes...Ok. So we had time to pawn through the menu and of course I was drawn to the MASSIVE beverage selection. I look at my sister and declare \"drinks!\". The bartenders where very friendly and answered any questions we had. For example...is the bar seating 1st come 1st served?  FF to 2 drinks later-all 4 of us were present-and the menu has been dissected (this does take some time), and our mouths were watering!!!!! We decided then and there is was time to start stalking for bar seats. NOTE: You can either wait for a table OR if you have a smaller party I would scope out the bar area cuz it's the equivalent of a busy parking lot. You check who is walking to their car/has their reverse lights on...well in this case...who's plate is almost empty/getting handed the bill.  FINALLY our bar stalking was complete and we found 4 spots at the corner and are very proud of ourselves!!!!! We order immediately. A variety of sandwiches are served in massive portions and we were happy campers! The Roasted Vegetable was delicious and the Half Combo was a huge portion...but if you survey the scene while waiting you will be witness to a variety of choices being served to your fellow diners.   All in all a good time and I will be back!!!! Can't wait for the new Cleveland Hts. location to open!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in a Sunday evening around 9pm right after flying into CLE. Sat at the bar and started off with a beer (root) - Abita brewed in Louisiana.. One of the best I've had - surprising bc I don't usually prefer cane sugar. The menu was ginormous, placed on backs of old record sleeves, and decided on the \"Big Popper\". Cheddar cheese and cream cheese with fresh jalapeños in beer batter and deep fried. Topped w powdered sugar.. Very good. Came witn a mixed berry dip, it is fab.. Interesting how it works well together. Not a big fan of sloppy slaw, thank goodness this wasn't. It was fresh slaw and def was awesome and refreshing. Must drench your fried in malt vinegar and ketchup. Will try a sandwich with meat if I get the chance."}
{"text":"Food was good, beer selection was was good!!!! Always good when Great Lakes Christmas Ale is available on draft, that just scream Cleveland Christmas TIME!!  However, the place closes at 10 and the bartender is closing the taps at 8:42 while the Cleveland CAVs Are in the television!!! I feel like I'm being rushed out"}
{"text":"I visited Melt with a girlfriend, arrived at 5:00 on a Friday night, and the place was filling up fast.  I ordered the Melt Margarita, which was a bargain at $5.50.  It was very good, fresh muddled lime, on the rocks.    I ordered the Rising Sun Melt sandwich which contained cheese (of course), battered shrimp, spicy kimchi and lettuce.  The sandwich was tasty and accompanied by pickles, spicy slaw, and seasoned handcut fries.  I only ate half of the sandwich, because it was huge!  I probably won't return anytime soon, just can't wrap my head around the calories and fat grams.    The ingredients were fresh and prepared well.  This place is definitely worth a visit, but just not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I had the New Bomb Turkey which was truly the most amazing miracle of my recent restaurant life, except that sadly I have to report that the cranberry dipping sauce tasted more like a candle smells than any cranberry sauce I've ever enjoyed.  The dressing and turkey and gravy and squash were delectable, and stood alone truly without the sauce.  fries were delish.  my friends both truly enjoyed their meals, and our server was fantastic.  our drinks stayed full, she was kind to the baby, quick with the bill & take-out boxes when we had to bolt because the baby had made it clear he was ready to go home.  two small complaints--nowhere in the restroom to change a diaper, also the volume of take-out business at 5pm on a busy friday made it clear that a huge reason we had to wait so long for a table, even early, is the large volume of take-out.  maybe they were short staffed, who knows."}
{"text":"Not that Melt's food is bad, it's just not worth all the hype it gets.  The wait is long, the serves is just ok and thought the food is good, I don't think it's worth the wait.    I do like to do take out from Melt because the you're not sitting in an overcrowded waiting area or the stuffed up dining room."}
{"text":"The food was great. I brought a friend here from Boston and she loved it. We sat at the bar around 3pm on a Sunday, so there wasn't a wait for food. Even though it was an off time to eat, the place was still pretty full.   We ordered two different grilled cheese sandwiches to share. The Mac and Cheese one was delicious but I was so full after 3 bites (granted, I eat like a bird). My friend finished her half despite feeling overstuffed just because it was too delicious to stop eating. The Cleveland Cheesesteak was great too, although much easier to eat.   While the food was fantastic, the attitude of the guy at the bar was not. He treated us like our presence was an inconvenience and had other bartenders and staff bring us our food and check up on us. That was probably for the best since they were MUCH nicer and significantly more pleasant.   Overall we had a great lunch and my friend was impressed!"}
{"text":"I will be honest to say we have never eaten here because all three times we could not get past the front door to be seated. Always crowded, which is fine with us, but the host was rude all three times. Would give us a ridiculous wait time. We always ended up leaving.  Seating looks uncomfortable. granddaughter has been there and said she had better cheese sandwichs at other places. She is 8 and knows her stuff when it comes to grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan of Melt, unlike most people in Cleveland. I had the sandwich that had a piece of lasagna on it because tips from friends. This sandwich was just a mouthful of oil and fat and I couldn't eat much of it. The side to this sandwich was also fries that were unappealing after the sandwich. There needed to be some sort of side or other element in the sandwich to cut that fat and oil. I haven't been back since and I don't find a need to go back."}
{"text":"I went to Melt with my fiance last Sunday for the first time.  Perhaps we have heard too much about it and had our hopes set too high, but we both left pretty disappointed.    Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular.  I had a grilled cheese with ham and tomato and he had an italian style sandwich with italian meats and peppers.  Both sandwiches came with fries and coleslaw.  The portions were huge.    Luckily we went early on Sunday so we didn't have to wait in a line to be seated or else I would have probably given this a 2 star review.  I would never wait 45+ min to be seated here as I've heard that the wait is usually over an hour to be seated.  I do not think it would be worth the wait."}
{"text":"I came here because I kept hearing people rave about this place, but after going, I wondered, \"why the hype??\" After eating there, I feel like a sack of lard. Completely greasy, heavy, and gross.   I ordered the pierogies as an appetizer: The cabbage was good. The (2) pierogies were ok but weren't super flavorful.   We asked our server for suggestions for sandwiches, and he was really nice, explaining in detail which ones were good with which modifications. I don't think I've ever really understood the concept of a calling something a grilled cheese when there's a ton of other stuff on it. The sandwiches are basically thick buttered pieces of bread with cheese (the grilled cheese part) - plus other fillings inside... But those other fillings basically convert the dish into a greasy sandwich with cheese in it.   I got the Chorizo & Potato sandwich w/fried egg on it (on recommendation), which was ok, but maybe too big, a little soggy past the top piece of bread, and again, not full on flavor. My friend got the Big Popper w/bacon, which was all pretty amazing on first bite, especially with the fruit sauce and funnel cake-like bread w/powdered sugar on it, but after that, it felt like I was just clogging my arteries every time I took a bite. This sandwich was probably one of the more unique items on the menu though.   The fries that come with the sandwiches were really heavy and most of them were fairly soggy.  In all, good service, some interesting sandwich concepts, and large amounts of food (definitely big/dense enough to split 1 plate between 2 people). If I were ever to come back, I would probably just get an appetizer and maybe split a salad. Despite it being what they're famous for, I could do without the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Love this place. Happy hour is great. Food, drinks, TVs. Especially the outdoor area."}
{"text":"Not sure where all the good reviews are coming from, any place that makes you wait 2 hours for a $12 grilled cheese where the cheese isn't even melted is not worth going to in my book.  Staff was rude too, restaurant was half empty but they still made us wait because the owner Matt wants to maintain a wait to keep people thinking that something they have is worth waiting for."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the atmosphere of this fast casual dining restaurant. Perfect for lunch with friends. I like the friendly hipster look the staff takes on.  No one comes close to the unique sandwich creations on their menu. They have something for everyone. Vegan options, amazing salads you would expect from a finer dining establishment. I ordered the Monte Cristo as I love trying different versions of the sandwich. Hands down best Monte Cristo in Great Lakes are. My partner had the Pork Belly and Brussel Sprout Salad and has recreated it at home becoming his new favorite obsession. In my opinion this place is best enjoyed as a late lunch spot."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and an incredibly extensive beer selection-- about 30 to 40 on tap. Chill atmosphere and great waitstaff. Only complaint is that the food service is pretty slow. It wasn't even busy. I also suggest splitting the sandwich in half if you are a light eater because they are enormous. On the other hand, the sandwiches make great leftovers"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Every time I'm in Cleveland I have to come here. I wish they would expand to other cities. Its incredible.   What makes their sandwiches amazing is the quality of the meat. Always proportioned well with sauces and bread. The meat is high quality and comes in thick slices that are not tough and chewy like other establishments. You can actually bite into your sandwich without pulling all of the meat out. Not to say the sandwiches aren't messy though. I always feel like a killed an entire tree because of the amount of knapkins I use.   Love this place. Glad to know I can still count on coming here for an absolutely delicious meal"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, tried nearly every one of the grilled cheeses which range from mediocre to fantastically EPIC. You're not going to find grilled cheese like this anywhere else. With the best ones at least, like the Godfather, what they put inside the grilled cheese is good enough to eat on its own, when encased in gourmet (in this case, garlic-toasted) grilled cheese, it becomes something out of this world.   BUT...  The wait is ridiculous. I hate that they don't take reservations. If they are successful enough to open new restaurants in Cleveland Heights and Independence, they could finally start taking reservations. I rarely go anymore because I can't bother to waste an hour doing nothing, waiting to be seated. Maybe if you're a drinker you can amuse yourself while you wait with their impressive alcohol list, but that's not my thing. I'm sure their seating policy helped in the beginning, making it seem popular and hard-to-get-into, but the novelty has worn off and they need to adjust if they want to get my business back.   Food: 5*  Service: 1* (for the wait)  Atmosphere: 2* (for the noise, cramped quarters)  Value: 4*"}
{"text":"Food here is really good. Is it ALL THE HYPE good; no... not really. Nothing wrong with it either just really good and a little pricey for lunch. @ 20.00 for a sandwich, cola, and tip most can't do this everyday.  That said the service was good, prompt and polite. The food; well far too much of it. I brought enough back to the office for AT LEAST one more lunch. With this in mind the price is not too bad but it depends if you want a reheated sandwich for lunch the next day? I am not into beer but it looked as if they had every brew made on the planet in this place so for many this will be heaven!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Much cooler than the one in Independence. This was my second visit to Melt. Can't wait till the new one opens in Fairlawn. I will be there for sure!"}
{"text":"This was the first location I went to. It was extremely busy even at 2:00 in the afternoon on a Saturday. Was worth the wait! Love everything about this place. It has a very cool vibe about it, and the concept is fun with the over the top huge sandwiches."}
{"text":"Do you like grilled cheese sandwiches? I like grilled cheese sandwiches. If you like grilled cheese as I do, you will really like Melt. Like me.   They offer so many different grilled cheese combinations your head will spin. I highly recommend looking at their menu online before going, so you have a clue as to what you might want. I kicked it old school at got a Kindergarten, which is just a plain grilled cheese. Ok a bit boring (esp. compared to the rest of the menu) but I wasn't super hungry, plus I was mid road trip and really didn't need to be in a food coma all the way back home to Chicago. Anyway, I enjoyed my sandwich, but the cheese could have been thismuch more melted. The place is called Melt, right? So hey, let's melt. But this is a minor complaint.  These sandwiches are pretty huge...unless you really want to put down some chow, go with the half sandwich.  Sandwiches come with some tasty fries, and an optional pickle. Further, if anyone is vegan, they have vegan cheese; if anyone is gluten-free, they offer gluten-free bread. Melt also offers soups, salads, and appetizers.   I was quite delighted to see the Burger Time video game in the waiting area. Anyone else remember that? I sucked at it, but if I was 11 and had a quarter, it was surely going in some video game, and Burger Time was in my rotation for sure. Now, if I see the Journey video game the next time I go to Melt, I will bump to 5 stars. And then some."}
{"text":"The service was really good, I think that's the most positive thing I can say. We had a great waiter who was really attentive. The food was ehh. Maybe the fries were the best part? MY daughters got the mac n cheese off the kids menu and in my opinion, the stuff I make at home is better... I don't want to sound mean - but its the truth. I got the fried green tomato burger and it was just a fried mess of beige food. I'm sure that appeals to a lot of people, but I enjoy flavor. I don't plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came here for this first time last month while visiting my in laws they rave about this place so I agreed to give it a try. I'm not a big fan of fried, greasy food but that's all they had. I ordered a half of some kind of turkey sandwich and all I tasted was grease. I get the concept of the restaurant and it's a good one but they need to have a few things that aren't greasy and fried. The atmosphere was bright and loud but liked the decorations."}
{"text":"This place is well worth the wait. Expect to wait at least an hour. Also the food takes about 30 minutes to cook, so this gives you lots of time to sample many of their items on the long beer list. I need to go back and try several items on the menu. Also the friend twinkie is a nice way to end the meal"}
{"text":"The place is just OK!  We stopped in around 3pm on a Wednesday, seated right away..  We started off with the spinach artichoke dip, large pieces of artichoke and huge chunks of onions topped with tons of cheese and tortilla chips for scooping.  The portion size was decent, nothing huge just enough for 2.  I would have really enjoyed it, except the cheese that was once melted on top became a thick 1/2 inch layer covering the dip. This made it very difficult to eat.  We ended up spooning our dip onto chips, kinda annoying.    I ordered the Monte Cristo and my boyfriend had a mushroom burger with onions and swiss. Both sandwhiches came with a side of fries and cole slaw.  Each around $10, not bad for pretty hefty portions.  My Monte Cristo was ham, turkey, cheddar and swiss battered and deep fried covered in powdered sugar, was pretty good.  I really liked the raspberry sauce for dipping.  It added a little something extra that I think the sandwhich definatly needed.  Over it was a pretty solid sandwhich. More then enough for one person, considering I only finished 3/4 of one 1/2. The fresh cut fries were okay, not a fan of fresh cut fries, but they were edible. The cole slaw was very peppery and didn't compliment my sandwhich at all. I love cole slaw, but with a monte cristo it just didn't work.    The mushroom burger was a mess, my bf was not happy with his meal AT ALL. This coming from a man who tries a burger almost everywhere we go. The garlic mushrooms were mush and the onions tasted just like the mushrooms, no distanct flavors between the two. The burger patty had a very strange consistency and didn't hold its shape (breaking off into pieces). The cheese was bland and over powered by the garlic from the mushrooms. He did enjoy his fries, but didn't touch the slaw. He says he would never get the burger again, so if your a burger fanatic like he is, I would probably pass on that one.   The seating situation is a bit crowded. The table behind me was close enough we bumped elbows. They definatly need a bigger space..Menus are on the back of old vynl record sleves, pretty neat. License plates decorated the walls, hey whatever, it's not my house..lighting is a bit dim, but enough to see. Parking is in the back in a lot with meters (1 hour 30 min max at the meter)  or on the street if you can find something. Cool place, but nothing so awesome I'd go back just to look around..  Overall the service was decent, everyone was polite and attentive. We walked out spending around $40 food, tax, tip. I'm not sure if I'd go back I wasn't thrilled like the other 300 plus reviewers were. The place just isn't all that great."}
{"text":"Loud but fun. Lots of food for the money, and tasty too. Not the freshest salad but a great martini."}
{"text":"Good food and a great server, but waiting a half hour for a table when there were several open tables in plain sight was infuriating.  Don't tell me you're pacing the kitchen!  Inconveniencing your customers for your benefit is awful.  Get it together Melt!"}
{"text":"Melt is worth the wait...period. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is cool and the staff is very helpful considering how busy they are. I think some of the reviewers who have given Melt poor marks because of the long waits have been spoiled by the fact that they live in a city where the populations allows them to rarely wait for anything. If Melt were in a larger city, you wouldn't be able to get a table at all. Keep doing what you're doing Mr. Fish, because it's truly fantastic!"}
{"text":"What can you say about carbs and cheese! I have gone down the list at this place! Love every toasty grilled cheese Ive ever had.  Can't go wrong with the Parmagedon or the Monte Cristo!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why this bank gave me a grilled cheese sandwich, but I will say that I have never been to Mexico."}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese sandwich around! The atmosphere is very laid back and casual. The space is small and trendy, but that's what makes it cool for it's location.  The food is incredible. Great hangover food or if you want something that will stick to your ribs before heading out on the town. The variety is incredible and the chips are delicious! Definitely a great venue to check out if you're in Lakewood."}
{"text":"three words - westside monte cristo.    sweet baby jeebus this is a big sandwich.  honey ham, smoked turkey, swiss & american cheese betwixt two thick slices of bread which are all then beer battered, fried, dusted with powdered sugar and served with mixed berry preserves - 'cuz you gotta eat healthy - and a plate full of crispy fresh hand-cut fries.  if you're counting calories, you'd better be able to count real high, real fast in this piece.  i'm happy to report i finished the monster off.  i wasn't hungry for 3 days afterwards.  true story.  the atmosphere is sports-barry with lots of photos on the wall, dark colors and, of course, a counter full o' melt merchandi$e.  the menus on old lp covers (you kids remember vinyl, don't you?) rock just slightly more than their original contents unless, like me, you get a led zep lp/menu.  tons of different sandwiches and the option to build your own (all for around $10 or less) + burgers and salads + a great selection of \"craft\" beers (harpoon christmas ale is considered \"exotic\" here!!) + friendly knowledgeable staff, most of whom seem like they've been there forever = people happily waiting 45 minutes to an hour for a table.  my crew stepped into melt on a chilly friday in december at around 11:30 a.m.  that's probably the time to come because the place was pretty empty.  by 12:30ish when we left, the line was out the door and into the 8 degree cleveland day.  frankly, the people who give this place 1 or 2 stars because they had to wait at a superterrificawesome place . . . um . . . suck.  you heard me.  you don't deserve to eat here.  go to mcdonald's.  we'll all be happier.  melt is opening a location on cleveland's east side, so that may help with the crowds.  i hope it's as good and will definitely check it out on my next trip to the area.  in fact, i hope it works out so phenomenally well that the ownership decides to franchise and open a place in boston.  if i have the means, i will happily sign up for the franchise and boston yelpers will make me fabulously wealthy.  i will be the king of cheese!!  melt is in lakewood.  odds are, if you live in the area, you have a car.  there are metered lots right behind the restaurant for parking.  there were busses going by on detroit ave. as well, so melt is accessible by public transit.  how conveniently, is another matter.  p.s. - if you get a tattoo of their logo somewhere on your body, you get 25% off for life.  but i think you have to show the tatty for the discount, so . . . choose your spot wisely."}
{"text":"Like many other cities, this restaurant (or locale), Melt, has seemingly gotten onto the list of places to check out if visiting the Cleveland metro area.  There are other Melt locations, but this one is in Lakewood, a somewhat hip city to the west of downtown and along a strip on Detroit Road where cool restaurants and coffeehouses are found, sans the hippie dippy vibe that many other similar neighborhoods elsewhere feel compelled to serve up.  Two very \"vanilla\" food items have been elevated to gourmet status in recent years, it seems:  macaroni and cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches.  As you can probably tell from the name, Melt has chosen to focus on grilled cheese sandwiches and elevate them to an art form.  Melt's menu of spins on grilled cheese sandwiches is quite vast and, with that, the servers know that they've \"got some 'splainin' to do.\"  And, they seem happy to do that.  The people at the front counter, where there are also t-shirts and maybe even cookies, were also very pleasant.  The grilled cheese sandwich I ordered, which came with fries, was hefty, tasty, and filling.  Then, together with french fries, it was a veritable meal.  I thought that the ingredients were nicely put together and of good quality.  Note that the price of these sandwiches is somewhat high compared to that of a grilled cheese sandwich you'd order in a diner.  However, you won't be getting a run of the mill grilled cheese sandwich at Melt.  Far from it!  This place also appears to be a hangout for people doing their beer and back slapping thing and, with its old school (faux) copper ceilings and the way it's decked out, it definitely looks the part.  I was going to start with 4 stars and then thought about going with 3 stars because of the price of the sandwiches.  But then I thought about it some more and Melt is more like a bad wreck that has you looking back.  In this case, \"bad wreck\" means a decadently good sandwich!  Thus, that would seem more like a 4 star event to me.  One just shouldn't go too, too often."}
{"text":"The only word that comes to mind is UNBELIEVEABLE! But here's my warning..........unless you're a over eater, you'll NEVER need a whole sandwich. Plan to share one or get a take out box for another meal. We loved this place!!!"}
{"text":"Vegan review- I got a takeout order from Melt to finally try this place out. The fries were great but mine were cold. My grilled cheeze was delicious- I got the mushroom one. Tofu BBQ wings - really not impressed, I've had much better at other spots. The vegan ranch was not good at all. Obviously not a healthy place to eat at but it does hit the comfort food spot. Not sure if I'll ever return but if I do I certainly won't be getting the wings!"}
{"text":"A must stop in the Cleveland area.  Food is great and the service is down to earth and friendly.  They have captured that \"lightning in a bottle\" and I hope it lasts the test of time.  Did I mention that they use lots of cheese here?"}
{"text":"My husband and I saw Melt on the Food Network months ago.  It looked amazing, so we decided that on our next drive out to the East Coast from Chicago, we would take a little detour.  We arrived at 2 pm on the day before Thanksgiving.  There was a 45 minute wait that included an incident where the door to my bathroom stall was rammed with a wheelchair by a staff member.  We were finally seated, and the service was chilly and slow, and ultimately our server shorted us on our change.    It took an additional 30 minutes to order and get our food.  My husband loved his Chocolate Stout Barbecue Chicken grilled cheese.  I did NOT enjoy the Big Popper.  Designed to be like a jalapeno popper (which I love) the entire sandwich is deep fried.  Inside are two kinds of cheese, including herbed cream cheese, and fresh jalapeno slices.  It is served with mixed berry \"preserves\".  I put that word in quotes because it was more like a syrup, but still tasty.  The menu did not mention that the sandwich is dusted with powdered sugar, which I found off-putting.  Basically the entire thing tasted like hot and fried.  There was no actual flavor of the ingredients inside other than burning.  I was very disappointed.  Each sandwich comes with fries (which were average) and sweet slaw (which both my husband and I hated).  We finished up our visit with bread pudding.  It contains dark chocolate, white chocolate, butterscotch, and peanut butter chips and is served with ice cream and chocolate syrup.  It was very, very tasty, but more like a bar than bread pudding.  It was very, very firm.  The place is new and cute and has a pretty great beer list.  Our entire check--including a beer and a specialty soda, two sandwiches with sides, and dessert was around $40, so it is reasonably priced.  If I were for whatever reason in Cleveland, I would go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Managed to get out here for a quick lunch with dad after picking him up from the airport, it was early and we didn't wait for a table, but there were only a couple open, the place would definitely fill up fast during peak hours, I would suggest coming here off-peak or be very prepared to wait a good deal of time for your table!  Ferris Bueller was looped on the TV screens, very apropos since I was playing hooky from work for the afternoon :oP  I gotta say, I loved the \"vinyl covers as menus\" thing they have going on there, I got a Bob Seger album and my dad got Tom Jones.....the day I get a Journey album it will be coming home with me!  Loved the retro decor, especially all the Dairy Queen signs, lent the space a cool vibe.  Food was good, I had the pierogi melt (can't remember the actual name on the menu) and it was pretty good.  I'm going to maybe take some heat for this, but the portion was WAY too big....I could only finish one half of the sandwich.  I wish they had an option for a half portion on their menu, it's such a waste of food.  Fries were excellent, very crispy.  Didn't try the coleslaw since I was too stuffed from the sandwich.  And my favorite thing about the restaurant??  They serve grape nehi....oh yeah, Radar's favorite drink, and it's totally awesome!"}
{"text":"By far, the most disgusting steak and cheese sandwich I have ever seen or tasted. Dry and mushy, just like the bucket it came from. The Gyro sandwich tastes like the back of a donkeys ass. Just pure garbage! $9 for a beer plus tax and gratuity! 4 beers $40, why? The tea cups had smears from the lips of previous customers. The chili was cold, sloppy and microwaved especially for us. Five hours later and I still feel nausea, indigestion and a headache. Just open a can of dog food and it would be the same as this dump. I can buy their tables and chairs for less than 10 bucks; so cheap. Decorations on the wall are so poor and stupid. The employees were so embarrassed to serve this peasant food. The owner of this place is a LOSER for serving this crap. He must really go out of his way to buy the cheapest food available from any food distributor. Even the fries suck! Wait till you see how stupid the soap dispenser in the bathroom is. Must be a retard to buy that dumb-ass dispenser. It was probably on discount. The TV at the bar plays reruns of FRIENDS, if thats not stupid enough. Whoever wrote a good review about this place is obviously accustomed to shit food and not being able to cook. Only a teenage punk with dirty underwear would say that the food in this place is good. I cant wait to come back and see it closed! Places like this do no good for the community and only benefit the money hungry and unappreciative owner. My review is an exchange for your shit food; you bought it when I wasted my money for a stupid wannabee sandwich."}
{"text":"This place really should be called \"Bread\", because you get a shit ton of it as part of your sandwich.  The food was just OK and not really up to the hype going in.  Saving grace here was the beer selection.  Not bad!!  Other than food and drink, the interior was also just OK.  I came in expecting to be able to kick it at the bar and watch college football.  It took me nearly 30 minutes to get a seat at the bar becuase the bar isn't very big.  Of the 3 bar TVs, one had a football game, another a soccer game, the 3rd had kung foo or something.  Got a lot of huffs and puffs from staff when I asked to have the tv in front of me changed from kung foo to football (maybe a Cleveland thing....who knows).  The front room seems like a magnificant waste of space considering how packed the 2nd room was.  All in all, I would go back if I struggle to find better options..."}
{"text":"Hadn't ate at Melt for some time but had enjoyed it in the past. Placed a takeout order and was told it would be ready in 25 minutes. Arrived at the Lakewood location at the 25 minute mark and they had not even entered my order into the computer. Then I watched the staff lie to other take out customers about why their orders were not ready. My food finally came out an hour after they told me it would be ready. Food was poorly prepared when I finally got home to eat it. Terrible service, terrible quality. This place has really fallen off from what I remember. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. I got the Attack of the Green Tomatoes as an appetizer and couldn't have been happier.   For my meal I got the Corney Beast. Other than being a little heavy due to the cornmeal better the sandwich was amazing. Also had a chance. To try the Chicken and Waffles and was fantastic."}
{"text":"Me and my friend made a trip to Cleveland yesterday and I was recommended by another friend to go here as this was what Cleveland was known for.  When we got here it was incredibly packed and we were told that we would have to wait 40 minutes to be seated. We decided to wait since I was curious about how good a \"grilled cheese\" sandwich could be ( I was warned by my friend that its not really a grilled cheese sandwich).   Our food took a really long time to come, which I understood that it was busy, but seriously 30 minutes to make sandwiches.... I ordered the Cleveland cheese steak and my friend ordered the Korean BBQ War Pig. I gave one half of my sandwich to my friend to try and he gave me his. I liked his better than mine. The KOrean BBQ war pig had a nice sweet taste to it and being Korean I love pork belly. The cheese steak sandwich didn't taste anything really special it was just meat and cheese with grease dripping from the outside (seriously it took 30 minutes to make this???).  The interior of this place was really dark, so I could not tell if I was dripping grease on my pants.  Our waitress was literally no where to be seen, when we needed our cups refilled and we had to ask another waitress to get our check, but we were told flatly by her \"to talk to our waitress about it\". I probably will never visit Cleveland again, but if I do I probably would not be coming here again. The long wait for sandwiches that I could probably make at home was not worth it."}
{"text":"My first time at melt, I had heard about it from friends that highly recommend it. It has a nice open clean atmosphere and friendly service. They have 20+ beers on tap. I am usually a wine or bourbon guy so I was not sure what to order beer wise. The cute and pretty bartendress made a few suggestions and brought me over some samples to try. I decided to go with the banana bread beer and it has a great taste and finish. For my dining experience, I ordered the Parma, Italy. The chicken was tasty and juicy with a great batter dipped coating, even though it said crispy breaded. I decided to add-on banana peppers and garlic mushrooms. The sandwich flavor was great, I really enjoyed it being served on Texas toast with grated romano cheese. I did feel that the chicken could have been pounded flat to cover the entire sandwich and that there could have been more provolone cheese to get the \"melt\" feeling I anticipated. It comes with hand-cut fries that were done to perfection, I order a side of house ranch dressing to dip them into. The ranch was made in house and was good but slightly runny, I would order it again though...Yum! My only issue was the price for the sandwich. Though not outrageous I did feel it was overpriced for a sandwich. I would go again because I would like to create a crazy sandwich or try a burger! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"We tried takeout from Melt a few nights ago. It was really difficult to make a decision since everything looked so good!  The experience didn't exactly deliver on the expectation. We went with the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer.  Expected creamy and cheesy like it was described...it was neither. Pretty much a bowl of spinach with some artichokes. They forgot the fries with the order and I was underwhelmed with the service at pickup.  I would give 2 stars if it wasn't for the sandwich. We'll possibly give it another try."}
{"text":"I have never been in the area so I checked Yelp to decide where to have lunch.  I loved this place.  Had the pierogi app and monte cristo.  Great!"}
{"text":"When I moved to CLE for school, I heard a lot of things that were new to me (came from the west coast). Being on a team of hungry AF football players, I kept hearing \"Melt this, Melt that...\"  After trying it 3 years later, the only thing I have to say is \"can I go back in time?\" I'm sure this is said a lot, but I don't know why I never tried it before. The selection and flavors are unrivaled for what they make. The Wake'n'bacon has to be my favorite, with the deep fried Mac'n'cheese at a close second.  If you are new to the area, or still haven't tried Melt, go and go now! The only positive for waiting that long was that my life expectancy has dramatically increased."}
{"text":"Food: 5 Decor: 4 Ambiance: 5 Service: 4 Value: 4.5  The grilled cheese, fries, and cocktails are very good. The tomato soup was the best soup I've ever tasted. This place is a quirky gem."}
{"text":"Went to Melt for the first time last week and was very impressed.  As others have mentioned, you will have to wait for a table.  For us it was 2.5 hours on a Thursday evening at 6.  Can't really knock a place for being busy.  If that wait is excessive (which it is) go to another restaurant, but don't come on Yelp and start docking stars.  That is like giving a movie a bad review because you couldn't find a parking spot.  The bar/restaurant is very kitschy with old, gaudy decorations behind the bar, retro Cleveland things hanging on the wall, and menus on the back of old album covers.  This Lakewood location is tiny with maybe 15 tables total and a fairly small, but lively, bar.  Anyway, on to the food.  I ordered the chorizo and potato sandwich and my waiter, a Charlie Day doppleganger, suggested adding a fried egg.  The sandwich was good, but I am VERY glad I took his suggestion.  The egg really balanced out the entire sandwich and kind of felt like I was eating a big breakfast between two slices of bread.  The bread was nice and crispy on the outside (to hold up the enormous weight of the sandwich) with the right amount of flavor and softness throughout.  The wife got the Parmageddon which was pretty amazing, too.  Very big, somewhat dense, pierogis made it very satisfying.  The fries were good hand cut fries and come in massive quantities.  Each plate also comes with some kind of slaw that isn't overly dressed, but adds a nice peppery crunch to the rather heavy meal.  Overall, one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten for a VERY reasonable price (around $20 for the two of us).  Wait staff was frenetic and attentive to my table's water refilling needs, which is a big plus if you plan on eating such a large meal.   Endure the wait and try it at least once, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Must have their fries and sandwiches. The BLT is loaded with thick slices of green tomatoes deep fried in crispy batter with sliced pork belly on top. This massive sandwich is about 3 inches thick packed with rich flavor and texture. The fries are also very delicious and hearty. My advice is stick with the sandwich and fries and skip the soup. The Roasted tomato garlic soup, although still rich in flavor, was more of a sauce than a soup. The taste and texture closely resembled marinara sauce. I almost wished that I had pasta to go with it after each bite."}
{"text":"I love Melt. Melt is one of the few restaurants in Cleveland that I loyally patronize. I don't often go out to eat, but when I do, it's to get something special that I would never make myself.  Melt is definitely special! So out of the dozen or so times I go out per year, half of them are to Melt! The sandwiches are piled high with delicious ingredients and one meal can easily fill you for two....If you can resist gobbling up the whole thing at once! They also have vegetarian/vegan options for when I'm trying to be \"healthy\". I especially like their Goodburger. The decor is kitschy and fun and this isn't the place for you if you want a quiet night out. If quiet is what you want, order your meal to go!"}
{"text":"Melt is my favorite restaurant in all of Cleveland and I've lived here my entire life.  Every one of their sandwiches that I've tried have been amazing. My favorites are the Waken Bacon, the Monte Cristo, and the Big Popper. Their 1/2 Combo is SO great and a lot of food for the price.   There are a lot of \"hipsters\" but that's their theme. If you can get past that and evaluate just their food - it is amazing!"}
{"text":"I can't think of a single person I know that would not like Melt. Just wow! If I didn't care about being morbidly obese, I would eat here EVERY DAMN DAY. I love the monthly specials and all the options... it takes a true master mind to come up with some of these wonderful creations!!  The sandwiches are HUGE and I can get full for the rest of the day just by eating half of one. The fries are also yummy. Last time I got the \"Dude Abides\" and it didn't knock my socks off, which shocked me. A lot of my friends get the \"Parmagedon\" every time they go so that is going to be my next choice. I can't wait!"}
{"text":"I've just been to the new restaurant in Cleveland Heights and I think Melt's business model is to make you wait for as long as possible before you can get food. Half the restaurant is empty space with about 10-12 tables and a large bar. On a random Wednesday evening at 8 30 we were told it would be an hr and a half to get a table for 3 people. Instead we found a space at the bar and were told that while we could be served, there was an hr and a half wait to get food because the kitchen was backed up. So we went ahead and ordered food. At one point we went to check to see if a spot had opened up for a table and were told that because we ordered food at the bar we were no longer eligible to be seated at a table. After all this when we did get our sandwiches (a little over an hr and a half after we ordered) they messed up the order and had to redo it. They did comp the sandwich they messed up on and the food and beer was fantastic, but I think the service and the layout of the place is designed to be as inconvenient as possible for some reason. I would never go if you're hungry and want a quick bite or with more than 4 people. Its just too painful."}
{"text":"Great food, but even when we place carry out orders, it takes over an hour and a half. After we have arrived to pick up our food, the order still isn't prepared. They have made us wait twice like that and it really is unacceptable for carry out."}
{"text":"Hmm...am I just as much a lemming as the rest who are enchanted by this place? Perhaps. I had planned to give three stars...but that didn't seem right. After all, Cleveland owes Melt a bit of gratitude, as it's placing our culinary corridor more prominently on the map.   Why? I'm not sure. I've never been a fan of grilled cheese. Apparently thousands of folks are though...some enough to permanently display advertisement of the joint on their flesh...at a price lower than magnet-ed ads on motor vehicles. But on to the review-  The wait? What wait? We walked in, made a reservation for 6, were told 1 1/2 hours, turned around and immediately sat down at the bar. Where you can order food.  I had to leave early, so that's exactly what I did. You'd have to be nuts to order a steaming grilled cheese sandwich in the summer, so I went with the peanut butter & banana with cream cheese. It was pretty good! It had a fruit preserve dipping sauce that cooled it down a bit. Add that to frosty fountain soda, and it was a pretty good meal.   It'd take me AT LEAST 15-20 minutes to re-create that in my kitchen, so I was impressed.  They have a ton of beers, and seems like a nice place to hang out. The bartenders were fun...however, the staff at the front desk didn't appear to care whether we were there or not. Which, I guess after hearing \"two HOURS?? Are you CRAZY??\" 100 times a day, you might see that effect.  So, everything was fine. I was happy to go and check out another Cleveland institution. But, not spectacular. Though reasonably priced. My friend who stayed said the five of them ate for under $50 (not including the bar tab they settled before hitting the table).  But, not because of the wait. It's because...well...it's grilled cheese people. Chill."}
{"text":"Well I was not expecting it to be so good! I had the monte cristo and wow, its amazing. I would have gave it 5 but it did take extremely long to receive my food. It was not crowded yet but I guess it takes a bit to create these crazy grilled cheeses!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome, excellent service and atmosphere. I stop here everytime I'm in the Cleveland/Lakewood area. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Friday after wanting to stop-in numerous times before. I was a fan as soon as I read the menu, and it also helped that the sandwich I had was delicious. This was not my first time at a specialty grilled cheese shop, so I was not new to the concept...yet this was by far one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've had. I had the curry chicken melt, because honestly I was skeptical that sweet curry chicken could go well with melted cheese, but I have to say they pulled it off wonderfully. The fries were cut to the right size and cooked to the right level of crisp and I'm glad they come with every sandwich because they're a great complement."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in after and Indians game, Was not crowded, was seated right away, food came a few minutes later after we ordered, We both ordered the Summer chicken, It was a very good sandwich, would get again, as for the fries, I give them a thumbs down, I don't like my fries burnt to me they were over cooked, not crunchy, and the coleslaw well I am not a coleslaw person so it was a no-go, but over all it was pretty good for the sandwich."}
{"text":"Was excited to see the new location.  Being used to the concept of a pilgrimage to partake in the fantastic and totally unhealthy food that makes Melt what it is, I was a little uncertain about it being a mid-week lunch destination.  So we arrived at 11:30am to avoid the rush to find only seats at the bar.  Not so bad, until I saw them keep increasing the time to deliver the food after orders went in increase to over 30 minutes. The kitchen seems to small and crowded and they were completing carry-out orders at a ratio of about 10:1.  Yea, no kidding, the engineer attending lunch with me kept the statistics.  Great food.   But don't go there for lunch unless you don't have a boss."}
{"text":"A true Cleveland original, as local as it gets. The funky decor provides the perfect atmosphere, constantly buzzing with friendly activity. Fight with your friends over whose sandwich is the most awesome! Just TRY to narrow the menu down to your top three or four favorites. Gluten-free bread was a welcome addition to the menu, too."}
{"text":"On an impromptu trip to Cleveland, my boyfriend insisted that we came here. He saw this place featured on man vs food and the second I heard how many grilled cheese they feature, I had to come.   We arrived at around 7 on a Sunday evening. They take no reservations and when we arrived there was an hour wait. Luckily, we found two seats at the bar to sit at. If you do decide to wait for a table, you pick a name tag from a giant pumpkin and you wear the name tag rather than putting your own name for your table. Originally, we put our name in for the tables and I received \"professor snape\" as my name. Such an awesome and fun idea- I loved it.   Their draft list was awesome- although I was recovering from two triple IPAs and ordered a water lol.   First thing we tried were the \"attack of the green tomato\" appetizer.. Fried green tomatoes. They were tasty, but appeared to have been fried too long- they were a little too hard and not the best fried green tomatoes that I've had. The sauce that came on them was very tasty though.   The boyfriend ordered the Cleveland cheesesteak melt with fries. He lovedddd it. He was only able to eat half of it though because it was huge!   I ordered the mushroom melt, with garlic spaghetti squash. My sandwich was awesome- the marinated portabellas were sweet and full of flavor and the provolone cheese paired so well with them. The garlic spaghetti squash was delicious! My only compliant was that I felt as if the bread was too thick and took away from my sandwich.   This place is awesome. They have a ton of vegan/vegetarian options as well! I had a great time/ awesome food/ awesome service :)-- would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We need another Melt review like a hole in the head. But hey, I haven't yet...so deal.  I'd like to give this place 2 or 3 stars, but quite honestly, it's the hype that leaves a bad taste in my mouth, not the food. I've eaten here a few times (mostly before they were popular) and I haven't had a bad experience. Cheese and grilled bread is pretty fucking good no matter how you look at it. Is it worth a 1-3 hour wait? Absolutely not. This is why I stay away. Although quite honestly, would it be so bad to drink for an hour or two before ordering?  What I find irritating are the freaking tattoos. I mean it's pure marketing genius on Matt Fish's part, but the idiots who get them? I mean, if I were to provide free advertising for a business for the rest of my life, I would expect more than 25% off my grilled cheese.   If a place ends up on the Food Network, it's gonna be popular. People are going to come from BFE and every farm community to come to Cleveland to go to a place THAT WAS ON TV! Holy crap! Hence the insane wait. I'm hoping it will taper off eventually so I can go eat here again."}
{"text":"If you've had Melt before, I've had this. Obviously over the top grilled cheese is the star of the show. This is greasy comfort food at its artery clogging best. This location features an excellent Avon inspired mural but the same experience that you would expect from any Melt. The location is huge and the waiting area extensive. The number of big screens in the bar definitely has it on my list for watching sports."}
{"text":"An excellent diversion on our vacation first heard of the melt on food network's diners, drive ins and dives. I had the big popper, if you like spicy food its great! My wife tried the Hot Italian another great sandwich. The wait is a bit long, we were quote 45 minute, but it ended up being a lot less than that."}
{"text":"I found out about this place through word of mouth but became a little leery about going because after seeing it on T.V. I got the vibe that the place was being hyped up more because of the 'cool' vibe people got from hanging out there rather than the food actually tasting any good. When I finally did go the service was horrible and I even questioned silently to myself if any of these people had even been trained because they were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off not knowing what to do next. Sure, they were all attractive and had tattoos and piercings, that's cool and stuff but, for me, doesn't make up for terrible service. The food came out room temp and over-all, was just underwhelming taste-wise. The soggy room-temp fries only became good enough to eat once I doused them with a ton of sriracha and my grilled cheese was poorly executed all around from the bread that was chosen to what was put on the inside and the fact that they served it to me barely warm. The place was loud and cramped and the decor seemed to be trying too hard for a cool and laid-back rock hip whatever vibe.   To me, this place failed big time at a good dining experience. I love funky grilled cheese sandwiches and hey, I even love hanging out at the 'cool' places to be, but I'd rather make grilled cheese at home than try to get a refill in that hectic atmosphere again. This restaurant just screamed sloppy execution all around IMO. For grilled cheese, I'll just go to Skillet here in Columbus and get their Truffled Griddled Cheese and be perfectly happy that I'm getting better food and saving money on gas.  The only really nice thing I can say about Melt is that they had a pretty large drink selection. *shrug*"}
{"text":"Long wait as expected. Told us an hour and waited about 50 minutes. Handful of empty tables the whole time. After finally getting seated it took about an hour and a half to get our food. Place has no sense of urgency for service at all. Food was okay but I feel like the place is good at generating hype for itself but doesn't deliver"}
{"text":"Food is actually \"decent\", not at all healthy but tasty!   So we ordered the spinach dip...Lotsa cheese dusted chips, not enuf dip.... hmmm gotta order more dip. 20 min later , no dip.. really...seriously?   Wanted sides, none. .. Hmmmm what's up with that? Do I have to order food I don't want and can't eat?  Ordered cocktail up, came on the rocks and short... hmmm, Y'all pushing ur luck...ordered another up, came with ice... suggestion...hire more astute bartenders.   Lastly, nobody will bus your table. You are left with dirty dishes unless you ask that they be cleared... c'mon guys... this isn't Dicks Last Resort, is it???   Drop the mic!"}
{"text":"what?! who are you people?? i have never waited at melt. actually, i take that back. i waited for 30 minutes once for a take out order. the hostess was apologetic almost excessively i felt like and gave us a $5 gift certificate for next time. awesome. other than that i have not waited. granted i've always only sat at the bar! which is awesome! because you can see all the beers they have on tap, which is an awesome selection. being vegetarian, i love their vegetarian substitutions. you can also customize everything, make your own sandwich, add things, sides, whatever! i've tried a few of these things here and they have all been good. the eggplant parm thing, the cleveland cheese steak with seitan instead of meat, the jalapeno popper thing. oh man so delicious. greasy, oily, but delicious. they have tofu too! the plates are huge - every sandwich comes with fries and cole slaw. honestly it's too much food, i can barely finish half my sandwich. but that means leftovers! yum. if you are too much of a health nut to eat greasy food, even once in a while, don't come here. i got the tomato soup once, it was kind of too fancy.. it was all chunky with garlic and chives. i would have rather have had just had a campbell's style tomato soup. oh i didn't mention how friendly the people who work here are! one of the bartenders gave us like a 3 minute speech about the menu and how it worked. so helpful! i still don't get the wait thing. sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"mmmm i love this place. i've already reviewed the location on the other side of town but i wanted to add a little bit about the lakewood location. i love the patio on the side. i know it's small, it's like in the alley way between two buildings, but i think it's just super cozy and a nice place to enjoy a meal on a nice summer day. being between two buildings in the alley just means there's shade so it's not super hot! i'll be back soon.. after i've lost the 5 pounds i gained after eating here last time!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time with my son for dinner. I had the Cuban sandwich. It was huge and it was good food. The coleslaw was also excellent and so where the fries. My son on the other hand and that of just getting a plain burger. Although he's not very picky he does not like a lot of cheese in his sandwiches."}
{"text":"The Big Popper... best sandwich I have ever had. Huge portions, I left with more than half my meal to take home and share for dinner. GREAT beer selection; if you can't find something you like, you're nuts. Very friendly service. I don't have one complaint."}
{"text":"Awesome - had the Kung pow Brussels sprouts and they were amazing!    Rising Sun recommended by Josh and it was delicious!   Great place, great staff  and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Certainly not the place to go if you are looking to be health conscious, but Melt is definitely worth the trip when you are in Cleveland.  I have been to Melt twice on two different trips to Cleveland and with it's eclectic staff and decor, there is a fun and relaxed atmosphere at the restaurant.   On my first trip to Melt I went for their November special, a Thanksgiving inspired Melt and it was MIND BLOWING. I am a huge fan of Thanksgiving leftovers and this sandwich took that love to a whole new level. The thing was so good I devoured the whole thing even though I definitely should have taken half home to avoid the post-meal food coma.   My second trip I settled on \"The Dude Abides,\" a sandwich filled with meatballs, marinara, Romano cheese, and fried mozzarella. Like I mentioned, not a meal for those looking for something healthy but it was also SO GOOD.   The service was great, our waitress was very quick and made sure to check back with us throughout the meal. While I sat at a table, the place also has a lot of bar seating and tons of beers on tap to choose from. This place is a Cleveland staple and somewhere I hope to return to anytime I am in town."}
{"text":"I came for a late lunch. Apparently this place is some Cleveland staple so I figured I should check it out. Generally it was good but for the price and the slightly strange service, I was underwhelmed.   I sidled up to the bar and the bartender gave me the food and drink menu. He kept telling me about the special which was an IPA which I am not really into, typically. Then he wasn't looking at me but I could tell he was talking to me. Apparently there were a ton of beers that were on their list but were sold out so he was looking at the whiteboard on the wall and reading them off for me. It was kind of annoying because the beer list is pretty large and I was just trying to read it, not have some onslaught of beer names thrown at me.   I asked him about a beer and he made a face like it was really bad. So then I asked about another beer and he did the same thing. So he says \"well, our special is our special for a reason because it's really good\". At this point, because somehow he hasn't figured it out yet, that I don't prefer IPAs. So he responds, \"oh, well that's about all I like so yeah..\" Thanks Captain Helpful! Glad you're my bartender, with such a sophisticated palate *sarcasm*  I chose the second beer I had asked him about and it was actually excellent. I proceeded to order the Cleveland cheesesteak, half sandwich. He told me it would be huge but it wasn't that big. Once I ripped off the crust, not much was left. Not that I don't like crust but it was really thick and difficult to chew so I just took it off. The innards of the sandwich were tasty but not $11 for a half a sandwich tasty. The fries were soggier than I would have hoped for. Maybe it was because the lunch rush was over so they weren't serving up really crispy fries, they had older stuff left? I don't know.   It was also atrociously loud in there. It was barely full and the noise was almost deafening. I can't imagine when they are near capacity. You'd have to text the person sitting next to you to be able to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and good service. Bar was pretty clean and the bartenders are friendly and ready to recommend good beers. No complaints on the bar staff.   Only gave it 2 stars because the sandwich I got was absolutely gross. It was the \"Popper\" sandwich with bacon added. I thought I was getting basically a grilled cheese / panini with jalapeños and bacon. What came out was a gross, deep-fried monstrosity that made my arteries clog upon first glance. The bread was 1 inch thick on each side and was deep-fried in a sweet batter that made it taste like a funnel cake. Sweet and spicy don't mix. That, and for a grilled cheese restaurant there was a suspicious absence of cheese on the sandwich.   I'm sure other sandwiches are good here (maybe.... it is Cleveland after all), but be sure to ASK exactly how the sandwich is made to avoid my mistake."}
{"text":"Pro  Nice location  Great friendly staff Good beer  Great food (big portion; reasonable price; great flavor)   Con Didn't experience any  Went at 3:30 on a Wednesday and didn't even have to wait for a table :)"}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken grilled cheese coleslaw sandwich. Need I say more? I always get the full size sandwich and save half for later. Absolutely delicious, also very heavy, you'll probably go into a food coma after eating here"}
{"text":"Good service. Good fries. The Breaded eggplant sandwich was no Bueno. Too much breading. Not sure bough eggplant."}
{"text":"I loved the west side location of Melt, but I live on the east side.  I was very happy when they finally opened a location on the east side of town.  Any review that talks about how long you have to wait should be ignored.  Yes, we know that the place is popular and has a very long wait.  Work with it, or don't bother coming.  My choice is to pick a day to do brunch and show up right at 11 AM when they open.  The last time I went, we arrived as they were unlocking the doors and were the second table seated.  We had our food by about 11:20 after looking at the menu and getting drinks.  You show up at 12:15 you won't get seated for quite some time.  You should know this coming in.  Enough of that.  Melt is exactly what it is supposed to be.  Great sandwiches and burgers, great beer selection and a cool atmosphere.  The last time I went, I had the breakfast burger, which had cheese, tons of bacon, and a fried egg on top.  The fries there are incredible and I only had a taste of the coleslaw because I wanted to eat the other stuff.  My wife had the Parmageddon and I have had the Monte Cristo before too.  I can't imagine there is a bad thing on the menu.  Also, the service has been pretty good and friendly considering how busy they are all the time.    Of course since this restaurant has been featured on TV it is bound to get the backlash.  Just skip that part of the storyline and enjoy Melt because it delivers exactly what it says it will.  Don't punish them because lots of people want to go there."}
{"text":"This place serves massive sized grilled cheese sandwiches. It has been featured on Food Network numerous times. They cater to vegans and vegetarians and have a loyalty program if you get a tattoo with their logo. As much as I love this place, I don't think I could commit with permanent ink if I lived in Cleveland, but to each their own. Since I live in Los Angeles, I have limited access to pierogies. So, I usually order the Parmageddon, but I get it without the kraut and request balsamic grilled onions. Most of the time, I just end up eating the pierogies. Don't get me wrong. The sandwich is delicious, but it's massive. If I could make one suggestion it would be to slice the bread thinner because it's super thick. The fries are pretty average. They make all of their sauces, so sometimes I get a side of their ranch. Overall, this is a great place for some unique grilled cheese sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I have a serious Love/Hate relationship with Melt. My first 3x that I ate (or attempted to eat) at Melt were awful. 2 hour waits on a weekday evening or mid afternoon and then cold food. However, I recently moved within a 5 minute walk to this particular location, so we've been eating here a lot more. We usually get take out or walk over, put our name in, walk home and then come back an hour or so later closer to the time that our table will be ready. The food, in my opinion, is hit and miss. Some of the sandwiches are amazing and others are things that I could make at home and have them taste way better. I do love that they have a vegetarian option for most of the sandwiches on the menu. I don't love that this place is a grilled cheese place and that you get very little cheese on your sandwich. I also am not especially fond of how greasy their bread is or that fact that I never seem to get pickles with any of my sandwiches. I will continue to eat Melt on occasion, when there is a special sandwich that I'm interested in or have a friend in town who is dying to go. Aside from that, there are plenty of other local places that make considerably more amazing food with a significantly shorter wait time... and plenty of pickles."}
{"text":"I got a half sandwich and fries (the mac and cheese sandwich) and it was really overwhelming and disgusting. I wouldn't be going back. I wanted to try this place for so long and I finally got to and I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Caveat: this review pertains to the Cleveland Heights location and not Lakewood  I love the look of the new location, the bar space is huge, spacious, nice design. I was able to walk right in at 7p and get a 2 stools, no wait...ahhh, that is refreshing. From there, it quickly took a turn for the 'meh'.  I must have arrived shortly before the real dinner rush, of course there were people waiting, when isn't there, that is part of the appeal, but the joint quickly filled up. From there I felt like i was rushed throughout my entire experience and it was not enjoyable.   There was one bartender who was so stressed and busy he was sweating. Running back and forth trying to take drink and food orders. None of the mull over the menu, have a beer or two, it was, what do you want? How do you want it?!? Ack! Ack! Get that order in. Once we ordered he did mention that the kitchen had about a 30 minute wait...as if it was a bad thing. 30 minutes? I was expecting AT LEAST that long. Of course 30 minutes is OK. Busy, busy, run, run.  Food comes out.   I ordered the Half Combo w/ tomato, a reliable choice. Well, until it came out. Melt is all about their grilled cheese, of course, it is famous for them. My sandwich definitely was not grilled, it was barely warmed. Luckily, there was a wonderful gentleman bar backing, possibly the manager, who heard me talking about the lack of 'grilled' cheese and offered to have them make me a new one. It came out quickly which was great, but this iteration was only slightly more grilled. I still ate it because it was much better but I was disappointed...Melt is known for its sandwiches and mine was prepared half-assed at best.  It seems like Melt, at least the new location, is catering to the press it got and a family environment instead of what it is known for: delicious sandwiches and a wait. If you want quick, crappy food go to Applebee's. I come to Melt because I appreciate a good meal and I am willing to pay for it both with my time and money.  There were great aspects. Melt has moved to biodegradable boxes - THANK YOU! I got a very perplexed look from a server when I requested tin foil. He implied it was a hassle and only when I was talking to our very wonderful, bald bar back did he talk about the transition to more sustainable to go boxes...thank you, no more tin foil for me. Thank you for taking the time to actually TALK to us. Thank you for taking the time to talk about the expansion, the move to the new boxes and just life in general. THANK YOU for providing the service I love from Melt, being a person, NOT rushing around like a maniac and allowing me to enjoy the meal and the ambiance. This man is this location's saving grace. Kind sir, you rock.   Overall, however, I am disappointed to say the least. While I still LOVE the beer selection and the food is still good, the service and quality at the Cleveland Heights location has sorely suffered. Please, please, please! Do not cater to the complainers. Don't rush me through every aspect of my meal because you feel pressure from other patrons. We will still come. The people who make you the most money (namely in beer sales) will still come, IF we feel welcome. I did not feel comfortable nor welcome during my visit last night except for the saving grace...the bald man in the gray shirt...YOU are a great brand representative.   There has to be a balance between service and expectations. Yes, it sucks to wait 1.5 hours for a seat at the Lakewood location but I will choose that every time knowing the service and my meal will be enjoyable.  Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives might just have been a bigger hindrance than it was a help."}
{"text":"I grabbed a passport and crossed to the East side... OK I crossed the Crooked river in search of cheese.  While having heard of this magically diary place of fantasy gooeyness, I have waited until the sun shone in February to go.  Seriously, I was alittle surpirsed by tales of waiting for a table about every review.  There are about 20 four seat tables, twelve two seaters, a handful of bar stool tables and a bar.  Plan on waiting the place is barely big enough to hold the 70's era WMMS billboard.  The place is decorated as a Cleveland landmark/people mural on one wall and plastic 70's lawn ornaments (halloween, easter, christmas, and thanksgiving, sorry uncle sam did not make the cut).    But we are here for food.  Menus are on the back of album covers (that is really big cd's if you are under 30).  The beer and more interesting rootbeer menu is bigger than food menu.  Step one of new place..look at other peoples food.  The portions are huge, as in the place has four inch stack of fries, slaw, and bread rising above this on every plate.  Step two tell waiter to come back as after ten minutes I'm down to four choices.  Menu has alot of variety in both meat, veggi-whatever, and toppings.  I went for Winter Chicken (grilled chickie, roasted peppers, grilled onions, chipolte sauce, pepperjack cheese, and super fresh bread).  In technical terms, the best way to describe it was yum.  It was perfectly cooked chickie juicy, just the right chipolte bite (Im not a fire eating idiot), peppers were great, grilled onions little crunchy, hell the only thing I could ask for was more cheese.  My partner in crime went for Summer Chicken ( chickie, lettuce, mater, havarti, roasted garlic herb dressing) Agian perfectly cooked bird, February maters are never red, but cheese was awesome nice flavor and more then winter chicken!  The sandwichs of course had fries and slaw.  Fries fresh cut with skins, every table is equiped with Malted vinager and ketchup.  The slaw is not your average slaw.  It will not be liked if you want creamy slaw (you can ask for mayo and make it closer to your liking), it has a chili pepper bite and vinegar flavor.    Next time I will be looking at North Coast Shores(Crab Cakes, wilted spinach, roasted red pepper, herbed cream sauce) or Fat City Burger (Steak burger, salami, honey ham, bacon, swiss and american cheese).  I would also be back late lunch/early dinner Prices range from $6-14."}
{"text":"This restaurant came by way of a recommendation from a friend in Chicago. It was definitely worth the trouble of getting there and waiting for a table (on a Sunday night nonetheless!)   I ordered the Hot Italian and hubby got the BBQ Chicken. Both were good, but we both liked the Hot Italian better.   Their entrees are big enough for two people to eat.  The beer selection was great.   Loved it."}
{"text":"An unreal sandwich experience. They dont take reservations, you have to be in the building when they call your name, there are 2 stoves, hardly any tables... but it is stil SOO worth it.  Amazing sandwiches, your Cleveland experience will not be complete without it."}
{"text":"Might have caught it on a bad day, but it was terrible. The service was really good. Greeted quickly and order taken with good timing.   Had the fried green tomatoes appetizer. It tasted okay, but there was soooo much aioli and corn relish, you couldn't even taste the tomatoes. I ordered the fried green tomato BLT.  Barely half a slice of over cooked yet soggy bacon. Each slice of bread was about an inch and a half thick and again with that over-abundance of aioli. The chips tasted like they had been sitting in the kitchen for a couple of days uncovered. Stale and nasty. My wife had the parma.  She was equally un impressed.  I tried her fries.  They were cold and mushy.  Not really sure how this place has made it on four different Food Network shows. And no, none was Restaurant Impossible.  Of course when you're going to be on TV, you have the A team on and everything is perfect. Glad we didn't go too far out of our way."}
{"text":"It freaking Melt... What is better than versions of Grilled Cheese! I would not go here if you are on a diet, but cheating once in awhile is okay. The food is freaking delish and the servers.... Super attractive... Nothing is better than being served a high calorie meal by an attractive guy.... all of them are attractive and different strokes for different folks, but enough about the hot waiters and more about the food. Hmmm,,, I really enjoy the Big Popper, because I love Jalapeno Poppers. Their portions are out of control too... I love it.... If I could eat here everyday and not care about being morbidly obese then I would. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Not too bad, service was a little slow, but food was good."}
{"text":"An American Classic with a gourmet twist.  The all American Classic grilled cheese sandwich grows up at Melt. Sandwiches that are so thick you can barely fit them in your mouth without dislocating your jaw.  If you are watching your fat or cholesterol this is NOT the place for you.   The atmosphere here is such a joy. Its like the eighties meets present day. 80's music blares on the stereo and menus are on old album covers.  The staff are a bit aloof from time to time which is my only complaint. As this place does get very busy on a Friday or Saturday night the wait can get very long but not to fear for they have beer. Let me rephrase this, if you cannot find a beer on Melt's beer list you are too picky of your brews. They carry over 100 beers They do not have a list they have a binder.   The sandwiches are served piping hot on fresh bread with a mound of fresh cut fries which are what a potato should strive to be. One of the most impressive things about Melt is their acceptance of change. Want a different bread, cheese or meat just put it out there and they make it happen so you can have the grilled cheese of your dreams.  I recommend The kindegarten (devise your own sammy) Tomato soup Municipal Stadium Magic (but with prololone instead of american) Westside Monte Cristo Smokey Russian The Hot Italian (sorry ladies sadly its only a sandwich)  Hit or Miss Getting the beer you order (give them a break with over 100 they get confused)  Avoid like the plague Vigorous activity after you eat here  Overall MMMMMelty cheesy goodness made to your every whim. Can you honestly ask for more?.  . . Well except for your next beer to come before the new year."}
{"text":"What is it with Great Lakes states and ridiculous but somehow delicious sandwiches?  First I discovered Pittsburgh's Primanti's (meat, cheese, coleslaw, and fries).  Then on this trip to Ohio, a friend and I went decided to check out Melt Bar & Grilled, whose grilled cheese is seriously on point.  It's not just grilled cheese, though-- it's grilled cheese with toppings.  Lots of toppings.  There's a page worth of combinations, and if that's not enough for you, you can always create your own.  We were a little intimidated but then decided that we might as well try some of the more interesting options, and shared both the fried green tomato BLT and the chorizo & potato.  The flavor combination of the BLT was great; I don't know if I've ever tried fried green tomatoes before, but these were delicious, and both the pork belly and the remoulade were delicious.  The only downside was that it was super messy, and got soggy relatively quickly.  I never would have thought to put hash browns on a sandwich before, but the chorizo and potato sandwich was amazing-- I'd definitely order it again.  Our sides of coleslaw were delicious as well; it's the vinegar-y variety instead of mayo-y, which is always nice.  They have a huge beer menu with lots of good options, and what looked like a decent mixed drink menu as well.  Parking is plentiful, but there was an hour wait early on a Friday night, so definitely plan ahead!  You can get on the waiting list and wander a bit as long as you show up again by the estimated time, so that's a decent option if you don't have a reservation.  Well played, Cleveland."}
{"text":"Meh. USED to be awesome.. What happened? Oh.. Marketing and expansion to other restaurants did. Quality, portions and menu options decreased while prices increased. I hardly ever order sandwiches from here now.. It's all bread. The fries are usually tiny pieces.. Honestly, I shouldn't need a spoon to eat fries. I love their salads.. However, you only need so much lettuce. Adding chicken to that? Sure.. Once you have a $16 salad that's mostly lettuce.. No thanks. The only thing that I enjoy here, and order from now on.. Is the tofu \"buffalo wings\" and crab cakes.. That's it. Everything else went down hill. Sometimes the buffalo chicken soup is good too. The wait to be seated isn't worth it to me anymore. Edit - crab cakes are no longer on the menu. I've lost all reasons to visit here."}
{"text":"Melt can do no wrong! I recommend the Parmageddon (pierogi and pickled onions on a grilled cheese? Yes, please!) and only order a half sandwich unless you're going straight home afterwards to put your inevitable leftovers in the fridge before you go to bed to sleep off your carb coma. I love all of the Melt locations, and the original in Lakewood is no exception. Hit up the Burgertime arcade game before you sit down to eat!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that the grilled cheeses here were awesome. Im talking life changing, in the best possible way. Made perfectly and customized to your hearts desire, this is a place that will please anyone with a wide range of food preferences. I can't stress enough how delicious our meal was. HOWEVER I have to say that as wonderful and glorious as the grilled cheeses were, the real show stopper here, was our server Vinny. He was funny, and friendly. He knew the menu inside out, upside down and backwards and when we asked for opinions and recommendations he had them. Shockingly enough his suggestions were spot on from the beer to the small tweaks in our order. I can't rave enough about him, or the food. Do yourself a favor and find or how epic the whole experience is for yourself."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Melt (or any grilled cheese restaurant).  It was fairly busy mid-day, with patrons waiting an hour for tables but we went right to the bar for seating.  We ordered the Cuban and Chorizo grilled cheese sandwiches and thoroughly enjoyed both.  The fries were delicious too - I loaded vinegar, hot sauce and salt on mine.  Several hours later and we're still massively full and will gladly return another time.  I took a star off for being a bit under-staffed but we were happy with the experience in any case!"}
{"text":"Mhmmmm melt. I'm writing this review as my food baby/carb baby is sitting in my stomach waiting to come out. The 5 stars is going to the food!  If you love grill cheese, unique sandwiches, big sandwiches, you will love Melt!  My all time favorite sandwich is the Kevin Bacon sandwich, which is a February special only.....they really need to put this on the menu full time. It's fully load with BACON, BACON and more BACON.  A sandwich that is on the menu full time that I love is the Wake and Bacon. Egg over hard. I love breakfast sandwiches! Served with French fries...yummy.  The wait kinda sucks on somedays. Since they opened the other locations in the area, the wait has gotten better. The food is worth the wait. You can always try and snag a seat at the bar or have a drink while waiting. Some of the tables are close together which I don't like, but you really stop caring once you put that sandwich in your mouth.  Everyone is real friendly. I love that they always keep up with refilling my water. There is a parking lot behind, it's a pay box during the day, free after 6 on weekdays.   Yay Melt! You make me smile!"}
{"text":"Get ready for a sandwich experience that's going to MELT expectations! The server we had was a rockstar and recommended some great sandwiches. Definitely split with your company as these will leave you with a serious food baby! Everything on the menu is great so I won't spoil the fun by giving any tips. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the for the 3rd time today and it was really great.  Got there at 4PM and there was no wait.  Excellent food, the meat and bread is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was great, lots of food for a half size portion. Fries were good, and lots of things to choose from on the menu."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars because my boyfriend and I fantasized about eating the other halves of our sandwiches for approximately 7 hours--the duration of the drive from Cleveland to NJ.  We were thinking about finishing our leftover sandwiches because these delicious things are so large, I cannot imagine eating one in a while sitting.  Plus the giant pile of fries and slaw also on the plate.  I had a Parmageddon because really, how can you pass up pierogies in a sandwich?  I was rewarded and the kraut was not super-fermented, which I enjoyed.  The boyfriend had a Might Macaroni as part of the Christmas in July celebration.  He really lucked out, as this is usually a sandwich served only in December.  Deep fried macaroni & cheese plus cheese between two fantastic slices of bread.  He added roasted garlic which can only improve things.  To top things off, the kind gentleman at a nearby table sent us a plate of fried Twinkies at the end of the meal.  Magically light for something deep-fried and filled with the kindness of strangers.  I would go back to Melt in a heartbeat.  If only it was not 7 hours away!"}
{"text":"OVERRATED!! I read this was the best in Cleveland, so it was my only \"big meal\". I sat at the bar since there was a line otherwise. My waiter/bartender was very friendly. I ordered the Monte Cristo on his recommendation. Highly overrated. Way too much bread and nothing to brag about. I didn't care for the preserves that were served with it. I ended up eating the meat and leaving both slices of bread. A heaping amount of fries came with it, but not worth their price.  I will highly recommend their pierogi. It was FANTASTIC! The cabbage and the meat were perfectly cooked and a fresh taste, which is hard to find in a fried food. If I would've only ordered the pierogi, my rating of this place would be top notch.  Meter parking along the street, so bring coins."}
{"text":"love everything here! lot's of food. if you want carbs and carbs then come here."}
{"text":"Unique and upscale grilled cheese sandwiches you say?!  Well, sign me up!    Client and I ended up at Melt during a recent business trip because apparently it's a Cleveland institution and it's also been featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives as well as Man vs. Food.  And, especially since I liked the sound of the concept.    Situated in a quazi-questionable neighborhood, this lil' bar/restaurant is cozy and lively.  Hipster crowd mixed with a few families and business folks from out-of-towners.  Since the restaurant is smaller with increasing popularity, expect a wait.  A long wait.  And they don't reservations.  Thankfully my client had a hook-up and we were seated within an hour.  Yep, that's how I roll.  We started off with the spinach-artichoke dip.  Skip this.  The dip was warm and not oozing with cheesy goodness.  It was bland and chips were stale.  After two bites, I refused to waste my precious belly room on this dish.  I decided to heed another reviewer's advice and split the grilled cheese sandwich with my dining companion.  We ended up with the HOT ITALIAN with fries.  And hot it was .  Spicy and heat hot, but decadently, sinfully HOT.  From the meat overload of pepperoni, salami, ham to the tomato pesto and the thick, oozing yumminess of the cheese.  This dish was true comfort.  My advice would be to watch your upper gums.  The texas-sized toast, though grilled to perfection, was very crunchy and scraped my poor gums up a bit.  The bar is fully stocked with countless beers, too.  Double score.  Melt gets two very greasy thumbs up for its creativity and unique menu of grilled cheese sandwiches."}
{"text":"Stopped here during my road trip to Cedar Point. Let me start off by saying why I chose three stars in list format : 1.) Not a hipster, so I don't get turned on by the ambiance of the place and the people working there.  2.) Not a fan of the wait. A popular place to be sure, but an hour wait at this place is far too long. 3.) Not a fan of the speed/efficiency of the staff (waitress and cooks). 4.) While the food price is fair, the quality/portion size isn't great.  Ok, with that out of the way, I'll say what I need to say. -The mac and cheese soup wasn't hearty at all. It was watery and made literally out of hamburger helper. Just runny hamburger helper in a coffee mug. NOT worth it. - I got the Big Popper. While the ingredients were top notch, the jalapenos were just too hot for me. I'm usually a middle of the road/medium heat kind of guy and the jap's were just too much for me. This sandwich is better served as an appetizer amongst friends than a solo sandwich. Also, the cream cheese inside was lacking. -The peanut butter sandwich had barely any filling in it. Seriously. Not worth the price, but it was tasty. - The waitress was pleasant but in her own world. Took FOREVER to get refills and the food. She barely stopped by.  - The food took about 35-45 minutes. Why on earth would it take that long for essentially a grilled cheese sandwich is beyond me.  - I loved their beer selection and the way it is presented on paper. Very detailed list. Probably the best I've ever seen at a restaurant. Kudos to whoever put that together. - The chocolate stout barbeque sauce is awesome. Find a reason to use this sauce on something (sandwich or fries).  Would I come back to this place? Yes, but very cautiously. I would never wait more than 10 minutes again to get seated and I'd probably be less accepting of the bad service."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection.  Major points for creativity.  Totally crowded on a Wednesday, but worth the wait. We got a seat at the bar fairly quickly, and the serivce there was great- I dont know what everyone is griping about!  It was loud- A place like it should be! We were still able to have a great conversation while eating fabulous food. The bread is seriously to die for. I had the summer chicken, but honestly I probably could have had any sandwich on the menu and been more than pleased.  Side note, the term lavendar mojito did not appeal to me what-so-ever. Melt is a total beer place.  My friend ordered one. I tasted it. And it was honestly the best Mojito I have ever had. EVER. I always think mojitos need something. The secret is Lavendar!   Go there. Now. Order a crazy sandwich. a couple beers. and then have a lavendar mojito. You will not be dissappointed."}
{"text":"It pains me to leave a sad review for one of my very favorite restaurants of all time. But sadly, this location fell very very short on the service aspect. I have been to 7 locations of Melt and the food is pretty much identical across the board. Matt (the owner) really has the QC down to a T. Hey, that rhymed! I am a poet and I didn't even know it. Or did I?  Tucked back off Detroit Rd and next to Mitchell's Ice Cream in Avon, this is a REALLY COOL location. They have the open garage door patio concept and a very very spacious interior. The bar is centrally located in the middle and plenty of standing (and sitting) room for those of us who like to make the day better with alcohol.   I was surprised and happy to see the menu revamp. A new kids menu, an added GF menu and a few new items tucked in. I was wondering when they would actually get around to this and they have! Ordered one of my faves, The Cleveland Cheesesteak on GF bread. Got their old school sweet slaw, lots of pickles and of course....their fries! OMGEEEE Their fries make me smile, my heart smile and my stomach sing. It is like Gone With The Fries (Gone With The Wind....Melt Style.)   A few things for everyone to know.   1) Their GF bread is SERIOUSLY AMAZING. The taste, the texture and the overall feel of the bread is really awesome. My kids (who are not GFree) love it. 2) Their peanut butter is a religious experience. If you have not already tasted it. TRY IT TRY IT TRY IT. Did I mention you need to try it? 3) They can pretty much make a sammie any way you want. GF, Vegan, Vegetarian?? They got your back! 4) Their fries will transport you to the fairs you went to in your childhood. Fresh cut, skin on and even malt vinegar on the side.  The ONLY reason I gave this location 3 stars is because our service was absolutely HORRIBLE. I do not mean it was kinda, sorta or maybe horrible. It was REALLY BAD. It took us over a 1.5 hours to sit, order and leave. We were 1 of 6 tables occupied in this establishment when we came and there was no excuse. We were ignored and even when we got someone's attention, we still didn't get the things we asked for. Definitely not Melt style. I would recommend another location if you are a newbie."}
{"text":"Melted cheese, fair-style? fries, and a cool hipster vibe? That is where it is at yo. Melt has to be one of my favorite Cleveland born restaurants. I have been to this location many times over the years. Why the hell haven't I reviewed it? Bad Ray. Bad bad Ray!  The Lakewood location has undergone a really nice renovation. It is more spacious (they changed the layout slightly) and definitely less \"divey\" in nature. It is more fitting with the new overall feel the newer locations have. I love the nostalgia Lakewood Melt offers. Being the very first location, it holds a special place in my heart. The parking here is enough to drive you to drink. Luckily they have an extensive beer selection and awesome bartenders.   I love that melt offers an AMAZING gluten free bread. I mean, you would never know this stuff isn't filled with gluten. They also cater to the herbivores too! Lots of vegetarian AND vegan options! Try their chili...you will thank me later!  I am not a happy camper that they downgraded their to go boxes and have downsized the portion of fries they give you. They also upped their prices slightly and I can feel it.   I love Melt and you will too. Come enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum!  I cannot wait to go again - it was that great.  Knowing the portions were large, my husband and I shared their August special - Slow roasted chipotle BBQ pulled pork, Fried sweet potato, Fresh crunchy slaw, Muenster cheese, Grilled sweet corn with roasted garlic spread & Homemade redskin potato salad.  It was delicious!    We also tried the August drink special of the Watermelon Boba and some other mojito type drink.  Both were really good.  Since we split our meal, we opted to try the Peanut Butter and Jelly Bread pudding.  Now this was something that I wish we had skipped.  I just didn't think it was all it was cracked up to be.  If I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely return and try a different sandwich or two."}
{"text":"i wrote a prior review for melt and noted that i wasnt happy about the lack of service and acknowledgement.  i decided to go back a couple of weeks ago and this is what i noticed:  *the service got \"marginally better.\"  to clarify, if i waited before for 15 minutes before someone saw me at the bar without a menu or drink list, this time it was 13 minutes.  and it was during the middle of the day where there was no more than 3 other parties at the bar finishing up.  *i dont like the fact they took my favorite sandwich, the \"lake erie monster\" off the menu list.  also, the winter chicken i had tasted like they ran out of actual patties and threw together some mashed up portion.  definitely did not taste like a normal winter chicken, very disappointing.  *other than that, the beer list is good, the food is alright (gotten worse), and i still feel that the service is still lacking.  thats too bad.  theres one bartender there who is always nice but even i felt she was slacking a bit."}
{"text":"really not happy with the fact that i placed an order online, was given a 35 min wait (order ready at 8pm)...and i waited 25 mins with no communication at all while 3 other people got their orders ahead of me."}
{"text":"As I passed it 3 times on my way to University Hospital with my Mom in one week, I knew we had to find time to stop in and see what everyone in NE Ohio is ranting and raving about! ;)  Soooo on my last trip to the hospital with my mom with I was in Ohio, we met up with my cousin who stays in Downtown, Cleveland he met us there and good thing it was before a lunch rush we found parking spot in a little parking lot a block down the road, it wasn't too bad of a walk but I wouldn't want to go on a busy day or time because parking does look very limited, or you have to park on the street at a meter .  Anyways, enough of the parking. O.M.G  1. Come with an appetite!!  You will need it!  2. There are a million different Melt's to try one to fit all needs, or you can change it up to your liking which I did.. because I can be a little picky. LOL  3. They come with great French fries, and Coleslaw. (Which I 86'd the slaw for pickles).  I think it's great for your whole family all ages will find something to eat if you don't want a sandwich they have burgers, salads, appetizers.  Even my Mom, who is a little picky to what she wants to eat, especially after just recovering from surgery, I was thinking she was going to pass on the idea once she seen how GIGANTIC the sandwiches are.. NOPE she stepped up to the plate and ordered The Dude Abides one with a meatball in it w/ fried mozzarella.   If you are in the area.. DO stop to one of their locations, it's definitely different from all the other places.   And the décor looks like Grandma's Christmas Yard Sale... huge lawn decorations lite up.. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge, great selection to choose from. Food is average. The first time I came I had the dude abides. Absolutely terrible. One giant meatball in the middle of the sandwich made it impossible to eat, and didn't balance all the ingredients well. The second time I came I had the popper. Popper was pretty good, not very spicy, which is weird because it is made with jalapeños. The berry preserves were on the side and it made it hard to dip the sandwich into it. Overall, I gave it 4 stars. Not a bad place, just not a great place either."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to get to Melt since I saw it on Food Network. Glad I made it, portions are gigantic, ambiance is cool and the wait is indeed fierce.  Some friends were in town from LA and we wanted to hang out before I had to take them to the airport. So we went to Melt to see if they are as good as everyone says. They are.  The menus are on the back of album covers. The beer and bottled soda list is long. The number of gourmet sandwiches is extensive. The cieling is blue punched tin. It takes a while to take it all in. We got there at 12:30 on a Monday and there was already a 30 minute wait, so we opted for the bar.  I had a bbq chicken melt, my friends had the porky cheese and crab cake sandwich. I loved mine and the porky cheese (ham, bacon and swiss) but the crab cake was a bit mushy. It was also really fishy. I'm not a fish fan so I am glad I didn't order it.  The bartender was awesome at answering all of our questions, making suggestions and just being fun.   Like everyone else said the portions are HUGE."}
{"text":"Anyone that doesn't give this place 4-5 stars is an idiot with no taste. Every sandwich is amazing, my favorite being the winter chicken. Tomato soup is to die for. Great beer selection. The only thing negative is that there is almost always a wait, but that's because it's just that good. It would be nice if they could somehow expand eventually, but as of now we can all deal with it. Expect to leave 20 pounds heavier."}
{"text":"I really like Melt, but I still like the Lockview in Akron better. Too many of Melt's sandwiches aren't grilled cheese, most of them have some slab of meat on them. I wish they had more creative cheese only options. That being said, I really like the Parma, Italy (basically a chicken parmesan sandwich).  Response to Bob's comment: That's the thing though, I don't want to make my own. I want to be provided specific options. I don't want to be given the ingredients to make my own meal, I would prefer that the chef does the work to make the creation. That's what I like about Lockview, they have a number of different grilled cheese options that have unique ingredients that compliment each other. Opposed to Melt, where I see it as more of a \"here is what we got, make your own creation!\" but I don't know what combination tastes good, I'm not the chef. Just my own thoughts."}
{"text":"This is one of my first stop when I visit home! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Melt! The wait is always long (around 2 hours) during dinner time, but you can wait by the crowded bar and order up some delicious beers from their large list. Cool environment too!  The sandwiches are HUGE!! My personal favorite sandwiches are the Parmageddon (full of pierogies, saurkraut, cheddar cheese) and the Monte Cristo (ham, turkey sandwich deep fried and dipped in raspberry preserves) I try to stray but these are my all time favorites and I ALWAYS leave satisfied (and usually with a doggy box or a second sandwich for the next day)  They also have some awesome homemade soups! Yumm!"}
{"text":"Great concept.  Poor delivery.  Fresh baked bread is delicious, but too thick, and cooked hard so that the first bite tears the roof of your mouth to shreds.  My sons had the Kindergarten.  Cheese was crusty on the outside of the sandwich, rubbery on the inside.  For a restaurant named after it , you'd think they could get a grilled cheese right.  Sweet slaw was dry and flavorless.  My chorizo and potato was delicious, but served overly hot.  The spice level was just right, but my mouth is still sore from the hard, hard, thIck bread.  My wife had the barbecued chicken sandwich, again, good, but the flavor was ruined by the bread issue.  The french fries were great.  The hipster wait staff was nice enough, but our order took a loooong time to get to us.  Not being allowed to order anything for the kids while we waited for a table also put a damper on our experience.  Table bussing could use a sense of urgency.  Dining room was unnecessarily loud due to echoing conversation.  Flooring or acoustic tiling would help.  I am a huge proponent of supporting local businesses, but I felt like the hype surrounding melt was very entitled: you have to love us, we are local!"}
{"text":"First time here and yes the Cleveland Steak sandwich was good as the waitress mentioned it was popular. It could have been more so had it been named the Pittsburgh Steak. My gripes, all the grease went to the bottom slice of bread making it too soggy. I was told the portion was large so I went with the whole for what was a ridiculous $15.50. The half was I believe $10.50. Bottom line the large whole that I ordered wasn't anymore than a regular size sandwich on 2 pieces of thick Italian bread. The 1/2 would have been more of a ripoff. I got coleslaw with it as a change instead of fries and it was terrible. Very vinegar and black pepper taste to it, again lousy  They do have a large beer selection and the atmosphere is nice, so that is a positive although the beer prices are a good $1 more than what you'll pay elsewhere"}
{"text":"This place is good for smaller groups. They have a good variety of drinks. Lots of bloody Mary options. I had the Mac and cheese sandwich, it was good but huge. I had enough for another meal. Our server was friendly but a little forgetful, nothing too bad though. We came on a Sunday afternoon, we had to wait for a table but only for a little while. There was parking in back as Well so that wasn't an issues. Overall I would go back and try some of their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Like most people, we heard about Melt from watching Man vs. Food, so we went out of our way to give the restaurant a try.  Their menu is excellent. However, we showed up for the grilled cheese 5 lb. challenge, so skipped all the excellent menu selections for the challenge sandwich.  The sandwich itself has 14 different cheeses, served on 3 large slices of artisan bread. To complete the challenge, the participant must also finish a pound of fries and 1/2 pound of vinegary cole slaw.  The sandwiches are dairy overload, but surprisingly the flavor overload from all the cheeses is delicious!  The challenge is nearly impossible to finish, and it also proved to be for us.  However, the quality of the sandwich and cheeses, everything was fantastic!  I'd recommend a visit here, even if you aren't visiting for the insanity of the Melt challenge."}
{"text":"Great service! The bar tender was so nice, the hostesses were real cool and they have a creative way to call you for seating! I loved the variety of options on the menu. The food was finger licking good and very hearty! I had a cheat day on the diet and splurged on this place people have been raving about. I went on Friday night and it was packed, we sat over at the bar since the wait was about an hour. I strongly encourage you to try this place if you are nearby. Pretty cool vibe, families, couples, singles...Ill be back! My bar tender Kev was attentive and friendly. He made me feel comfortable and Ill be back!!!! Xo"}
{"text":"We came to Cleveland on a quick spring break trip and picked Melt due to a Great Yelp rating.  This place is different from anything we have in Indiana a refreshing change from chain restaurants.    I had the Big Popper my husband had the Godfather.  So delicious and so much food.  The fries were amazing.  You could eat here often and not repeat meals.   I do not eat meat so this restaurant is perfect.  It also helps the staff is easy on the eyes.  The restaurant is decorated festive as well.  If you live in the area and have not eaten here u are missing out."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Service was fine but the food was underwhelming. Although the basic grilled cheese was delicious, The entree salad was blah and needed to be more chilled, the Mac and cheese appetizer was just greasy M&C in big clumps, and the spinach artichoke dip was the worst I have ever had. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Woah this place is crazy! I was really impressed by the decor and bar. Only problem with this place you literally GET TOO MUCH FOOD. SO FULL OMG. I got the purple parma (a little greasy) but I enjoyed it. One friend got the jalapeño popper and it was amazing (jealous). My friend didn't like the steak much and another friend got the cliche Mac and cheese (yummy!)"}
{"text":"I've been to Melt quite a few times within the past few years (this location in particular). Everytime I come here, the food is outstanding. I highly recommend The Dude Abides, or the Smokehouse Club. The sandwich in the picture is the latter. The food always comes out tasty with PLENTY of cheese. The sandwiches are always massive and frankly, its hard to pick just one everytime. The waitress we had tonight was very personable, and said that she wished she could eat with us! I wish i caught her name but alas, I did not. Side note, the menus all have a back to them that is some famous soundtrack. I happen to get Beauty and the Beast, which my wife loved. My only real complaint would have to be how long the food took to came out. There were only three of us in my party, and the restaurant itself was modestly full. It took about 20-25 minutes to come out. But in the long run, it was totally worth it. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"It's good.  Grilled cheese.  Advice? Order one meal and share.  I founded the clean plate club and failed.   Too much food.  Nice beer selection."}
{"text":"OK, let me try to take an objective stab at this one. After all, given the foaming at the mouth proselytizing that goes on about this place it would appear that I'll, once again, be in the minority.  I personally can't believe the risk that the owners of Melt have taken, expanding to four locations in about as many years in one of the worst economies our country has ever seen. I've got two words, big balls. At any rate, it would appear that their plans are working...for now. With an easily reproducible business model (Cleveland tchotchke, overstuffed grilled cheese sandwiches a la Panini's, decent beer list) and a market with a seemingly insatiable desire for anything fried, buttered and cheesed, Melt has turned itself into a local phenomenon.  I haven't eaten at all of the locations (sorry Mentor, just too damn far) but I think I've got the gist. Here's what you get:  Long wait times - We've visited at 5pm on a Wednesday and 6pm on a Sunday. We're talking about a 30 minute wait on average. It's even worse at the Lakewood location. If you can snag a space at the bar do it. The tables are bunched together and small anyway. Besides, the bar service is typically better.  Xeroxed décor - If you want to see what all the fuss is about, go to the Lakewood location; it's still hanging on to its personality. The other locations just seem contrived, mere facsimiles of the original. Big, light-up lawn decorations like snowmen and bunnies adorn the walls above the bar, a giant Dairy Queen sign on one wall, a black and white mural of all things Cleveland on the other. It feels more like a TGI Fridays than something that was lovingly created over years of collecting.  Creatively tasty variations on a grilled cheese - If there's one thing I can't argue with it's the sandwiches. Don't come here and order a salad or fill up on appetizers you can get everywhere else. Their grilled cheese sandwiches are big, greasy gut bombs that will easily render you helpless and in a food coma. On a recent trip I had the Hungry Hungarian, a grilled cheese (of course) stuffed with chicken paprikash. After I woke up I was just happy I had another half to eat for lunch the next day.  Awful cole slaw - Don't order it, seriously. It's served with everything and it shouldn't be.  It's basically dry cabbage with pepper on it. Where's the mayo? I don't want to be a part of a society where this disaster is acceptable. Need some help? Visit any KFC. This atrocity should be eliminated from the menu, it just angers the patrons and insults the sandwiches. You've been warned.  Average service - I can't blame Melt for this one, I think average service has become the norm just about everywhere. You'll wait longer than you want for your drinks, you'll probably get a server that seems annoyed with you, and you just might not get everything you ordered exactly as you ordered it. Just expect it and it will be easier to swallow.  It's loud - Your throat is gonna be raw after your meal. Call me old fashioned  but I like to be able to hear the person seated across from me when we're dining together. It's no wonder everyone's face-down in their phones. They're texting back and forth so they can understand the conversation.  A decent beer list - Melt has this one going for it. I don't remember the exact number, but I'm thinking a couple dozen drafts, regularly rotating, and 20-30 bottles. I've had some stellar brews here - Left Hand Fade to Black, Corsendonk Christmas, Bell's Two Hearted, you get the picture. If you're a beer geek like me you will find something new to try. If you drink Bud Light you won't give a shit. On the down side, I've yet to talk to a server or bartender at Melt that knows anything about beer. You know that look your dog gives you when you ask him if he wants to go for a walk? The one with the slightly glazed over eyes and tilting head? That's what happened when I asked our last server a few questions about their draught offerings.  Don't get me wrong, I do like Melt, I'm just not *in* like with them. Actually, I like who they used to be. They used to be a special little piece of Cleveland, sort of tucked away in the burbs, out of the mainstream. They were cool. Something that Clevelanders were proud and a bit protective of. This was before Food Network turned it into a destination. Before it turned into a chain. Before 45 minute waits, before the out-of-towners crowding up the joint (seriously, check out how many Yelps are from out of state). I don't know. I'm torn. Whatever happened to a place being happy with who they are? I'm just sappy that way. I still long for the days when Sam Adams was a microbrewery."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, lots of grilled cheese options, and great service - the food was so-so... We had the pierogi and Mac and cheese sandwiches. The portions were huge, and the fries were delicious. The sandwiches, while filling, were not very flavorful. The bread is what you mostly taste. Melt also has a great drink menu! The non grilled cheese food options are limited. I am not eager to go back."}
{"text":"The portions are huge. The flavors are awesome. The pierogi are solid. But the service...sucked.  After being seated almost immediately, I was standing up to leave following a 10 minute wait before a server ran to me to get my drink and food orders. Another server came up and apologized for not taking care of me, which was nice, but it still took almost another 15 minutes to get my sandwhich, and the only reason I didn't up and leave again is I didn't want to be that guy.  I had hoped the pierogies I'd ordered would be served ahead of the sandwhich to help break up the wait, but it all came out at once, and the server pretty much said they'd forgotten to deliver the appetizer earlier.  The food was ALMOST worth the wait, and I would go back if asked, but there's a limit to how long you should expect to wait for a grilled cheese, no matter how good it is. With better service, this would have been a four or five star review."}
{"text":"The Melt has a great selection of beers on draft that are all very reasonably priced.  (36 draft beers to be exact)  The food, meh, I guess it tastes good, but lets be honest, it's fried buttered bread, topped with copious amounts of cheese, excessive meat and other random high calorie tid bits.    The menu is out of control. It's like whoever made it decided to take every sandwich and make it as unhealthy and fattening as they could.  A meatball sandwich with deep fried mozzarella sticks?  Seriously?    So since it was going to be one of those kinds of meals (the hard on the heart, thick in the thighs kind of meal) I ordered the Melt Burger which was pretty much a huge greasy burger with cheese.  I was disappointed they didn't serve tomato, lettuce and onion with it.  Only a burger sandwiched between two buttered/fried pieces of bread with lots and lots of American cheese.  Of course the burger tasted good, but it was super greasy.  All sandwiches come with a mountain of fries and a scoop of coleslaw.  On a prior visit I tried the BBQ chicken sandwich which was grilled chicken slathered with copious BBQ sauce and topped with globs and globs of cheese.     I guess if you were paying for the number of calories you get for the dollar this place would be the best deal in all of Cleveland!  I'm hesitant to give it 3 stars, because honestly I don't like this place and won't be coming back.  But to be fair, I guess if a deep fried, cheesy pigout is what you are looking for at a reasonable price, stop no further, the Melt is it.   Bottom line: The beer selection is fantastic.  A meal here will be a greasy, cheesy piggy pig pigout of epic proportions at a reasonable price.  Service is polite, but slow.  You will also have to wait a long time to be seated."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Melt establishment in a few years, and I was nothing short of impressed when I came here last night.   Great service, impeccable food (highly recommend \"The Dude Abides\") and tasty assortment of craft beer!"}
{"text":"To the folks who say \"you shouldn't have to wait 2 hours for a grilled cheese\" - I say: DON'T! Please, I'm begging you, if you think you can whip up a grilled cheese sandwich at home of similar or better caliber, be my guest. I've tried with all my might to clone Melt at home; I've come close on some sandwiches, but it's not as easy as you'd think.  Look people, most of us grew up toasting two slices of bread with some American cheese in the middle. The fact Melt serves something that's also called \"grilled cheese\" does not mean it's the same thing. Get this out of your brain.  Here's something a lot of reviewers don't seem to know/understand: Melt (the original one in Lakewood) started as a bar - the fact that the sandwiches became such a hit was a nice surprise. BUT, the thing that Melt is really awesome at is being a bar! Do you like beer? Just look at their craft beer list. Few bars in town are going to have a list that good, and at decent prices to boot."}
{"text":"It's kind of weird that a restaurant as awesome at Melt now has a location in a place as lame as Independence.  In the land typically dominated by Panera, Chipotle, and side-of-the-highway hotels, you might drive past Melt the first time you visit, which is hidden away in a suburban strip mall next to a Nationwide Insurance office. As you dine, you can enjoy a beautiful view of a surface parking lot and some 3-story suburban office space across the street, while cars speed down the busy Rockside Road.  OK, so I don't think very highly of the neighborhood, and frankly, if it weren't for Melt, wouldn't have ever come out here, but Melt still deserves 5-stars, because it really is just that good.   The sandwiches are as good as what you'll get in Lakewood or Cleveland Heights, and there's 40, awesome, high-quality beers on tap. The staff is great, and Matt Fish has clearly done a good job with quality control, as the food here is as consistent and good as the other locations."}
{"text":"Ah, the original Melt... the little bar that started it all is still as awesome as ever.  A couple of years ago I was telling a friend of mine that I needed a part-time job. He was a line cook at a now-failed restaurant, and said, \"I cook with this guy Matt who's opening up a new bar in Lakewood - Melt. Maybe I could get you a job there.\" I said no thanks and it was too far from my house at the time. Who knew that this is what it would become.  Of the three locations, this is the smallest, has the fewest tables, the smallest bar, and the fewest beer taps. Of the three locations, this one feels the most like a true neighborhood watering hole.  The sandwiches are amazing, and if you think \"what's so special about grilled cheese?\" then you owe yourself a favor to at least try them out. I've tried with all my might to replicate these sandwiches at home. You can get the same bread and put the same ingredients inside, but it never turns out the same.  Listen, if you come to Melt, you're going to have to wait. If you can't handle it, Lakewood has plenty of other restaurants. If the wait is exceedingly long, I recommend the Root Cafe, about 2 blocks down the street."}
{"text":"Went to Cleveland for two days and was lucky enough to have a friend bring me here Sunday evening. For a late Sunday night, this place was surprisingly full. I loved the atmosphere, the decoration is quite unique and the layout of the bar and tables is strategic.   The tofu \"wings\" are a must. Especially for those who like tofu..and like wings. It literally is a hybrid tofu with fried chicken qualities. I tried the thai flavored one and it was absolutely delicious.   Shared the godfather grilled cheese with a friend. For an idea of the serving size, both of us barely made it half way through our own half. I definitely recommend sharing since this type of food just isn't the same when you pack it to go.   Also had the pear cider they had on draft. I enjoyed that a lot. Quite fruity, similar to most apple ciders out there, but pear flavored.   Overall, good atmosphere, good service, good food, and good drinks."}
{"text":"From the funky decor to the eclectic sandwich menu, this place was awesome! Unique sandwiches that can be altered for everyone. Most menu items can be made vegetarian and even vegan. The friendly staff (we sat at the bar) was more than accommodating while I modified my sandwich. Rotating drafts always a plus. I tried the colab with Fat Heads Brewing: Melt Lean Mean Machine. Solid beer! Sandwiches are available in half or full order and served with a generous portion of perfectly seasoned French fries. Would definitely recommend visiting Melt if traveling in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"The Melt Bar & Grilled has Great Sandwiches and an incredible selection of Craft Beers. The Monte Cristo is the Best Sanggie on the Planet!"}
{"text":"First off let me say that I used to be a waitress and have worked in customer service far longer than I care to admit. So I'm overly sympathetic and accommodating when it comes to wait staff. I'm the first to think, \"Oh, they must have had a hard day\" or \"Nobodies perfect\" when I receive poor service and I've never complained at a restaurant before. But the service here is inexcusable.   I've experienced waiters here go out of their way to be rude and insulting. Once while dining with a friend (who had the word \"Fancy\" tattooed across his neck) the waitress continually referred to him as \"fancy\" and \"fancy pants\" even after he politely told her he greatly disliked being called that. On a separate occasion another friend received the wrong order. After 25+ minutes of waiting for the waiter to come back so she could inform him (meanwhile everyone else was nearly done with their meal) he accused her of having eaten part of it although it was clearly untouched and gave her a hard time about taking it back. She told him he was being rude and \"a jerk\". He finally took it back and brought her the correct meal another 20 minutes later. Then he just never came back to the table... we were there an hour and a half and he never came back. We had to go up front and request our check just so we could leave. These were the two worst experiences but this type of treatment isn't uncommon. It's also an insult to have gratuity tacked onto a bill after treatment like that. I was told it is only automatically tacked on for parties of 6 or larger but every time I have been it was included in the bill, no matter how few people were there.  I suppose when a place has gratuity tacked onto the bill and is running on pure hype they don't need to have a polite wait staff.   I will say that there is one waiter we have had named \"Whitey\" who was very polite and attentive. Now every time we go (not my choice, I assure you) we request him specifically, even if it means a longer wait. He has been the only nice one.  I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the food is good. Good as in, better than ok but not great. I've had better and didn't have to wait two hours to get it and be insulted by a cosmetology school drop out hipster.  Bottom line, be prepared for a long wait for a grease bomb sandwich and a wait staff that expects you to lick their boots for the privilege of eating there (unless you get Whitey, the only friendly waiter there). 95% hype, 5% decent food."}
{"text":"For those who have ever been to a Mellow Mushroom - this reminds me of the sandwich version of it.   Lots of fun tshotchkes everywhere include random road signs and tons of Christmas yard decor.   When you check in they give you a name tag with a movie title instead of asking your name (I got Home Alone)  The sandwiches all look amazing and are HUGE. So even though it's a bit on the pricier side - you will get your money's worth because mostly likely you will get two full meals out of it.   The also have craft beer and sodas -- yummmmmy.   Good food and good service."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough about a place that focuses on my favorite childhood food. Who doesn't love grilled cheese? I'm so disappointed in myself for going after already eating dinner. I ended up getting a PB&J grilled cheese as more of a dessert and it was so delicious. I tried to stop by the last time I was in town but the wait was too long. I wish they had reservations.   I'd definitely come back and send friends this way when they are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe some of the comments in here.   You guys, go to the Westside Market, buy some bread from Mediterra and some cheese from anywhere, take last night's leftovers, butter one side of two pieces of bread, grill in a pan over medium-low heat.   There, you probably just made a sandwich that's better than anything from Melt.   The best grilled cheese ever? The best sandwich ever? Are you kidding?   How this place is our landmark absolutely baffles me. I just... undercooked fries, every. single. time? Lifeless vinegar slaw? Those fries are awful, they don't even bother to blanch them beforehand cause they're too busy making money on these sandwiches.   I really don't get it. I assure you, with less than one day's practice and one trip to a decent grocery store you can EASILY make a sandwich that tastes WAY better than any of these.   I've heard their salads are good but who goes to a famous sandwich restaurant for a salad?   One extra star because they have a pretty decent bar and strong bartenders."}
{"text":"Melt would have been a great experience, but the wait te was UNBEARABLE! We waited an hour for our table. Which would not have been a big deal except for it was another hour to get our food. the food was great but not worth a two hour wait in a cramped place with no room to even get a drink"}
{"text":"I'll simply say that I am a huge fan of Melt. The food is consistently good (although the portions are insane, so be prepared to take home leftovers), and the beer list is always interesting (good amount of both draft and bottle choices). The service also has always been terrific and have never had a negative experience from any of the servers or bartenders. What makes Melt truly special is that they can make essentially any sandwich vegetarian or vegan. They have a few vegan cheese options and have plenty of non-meat alternatives to choose from (even though their tofu is pretty darn good too). Of course, they have plenty of meat choices too, which makes Melt a perfect place for groups that have a range of dietary preferences.  They also have a build-your-own style sandwich option, if you want to keep your grilled cheese more simple. Sure, sometimes the wait can be a tad long, but the space is pretty big and I have never had to wait more than 20-30 minutes for a table. There also is plenty of seating at the bar, where it is easy to order food as well. All in all, a fun take on comfort food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"They food was very good, a friend got the crispy chicken salad looked great, I got the Cleveland steak also very good. My only complaint the music was so loud couldn't have conversation. When music went off for football better until kid started screaming bad acoustics."}
{"text":"I always love a visit to MELT when I'm back east; the Independence location did not disappoint. I was happy to see that sandwiches can now be ordered in half- or whole-sizes. A half-sized jalapeño popper with fries and sweet slaw was just what I wanted! The sandwich is deep-fried goodness stuffed with herbed cream cheese, jalapeño, and raspberry sauce for dipping.  Great food and conversation with my family during our Cleveland day trip."}
{"text":"I love MELT! So glad when the Mentor location opened, closer drive from my hometown of Erie, PA. My favourite sandwich is the Parmageddon, but once in a while I like to change things up. The jalapeño popper is another go-to that's really tasty. Can't wait to be back on the east coast and get my fill again..."}
{"text":"In a gist: a lot of indians, not a chief in sight.   Seriously. Who's running this place?   I'm not the type to hate on a restaurant purely because they have had nothing but glowing reviews. However, there are some serious flaws with this place, which thankfully isn't expensive or I'd have throw a temper tantrum the likes of which would have gone down in Cleveland history.  First and foremost. We waited 30 minutes for a table. The place was not crowded, it had a good number of customers, but nothing that well-run kitchen and a competent wait staff couldn't have turned over incredibly quickly.   Though pleasant, the wait-staff clearly had zero direction. Or perhaps they're all too young to know that TIPS means \"To Insure Prompt Service.\" I waited for 5 minutes after my crab-cakes (their label, not mine) arrived to get silverware which should have been on the table when I sat down. This was after looking around and waving at various waiters trying to get SOMEONE'S attention. Boxes had to be inquired even after we were clearly finished. And the bills took a separate trip from the waitress which was beyond ridiculous.  Along with this, the kitchen clearly had no direction either. There should be little to no wait between appetizers and entrees. There should be some kind of quality control (you know, to make sure customers are getting good meals) which was obviously lacking. And someone better make sure that my food gets to me HOT.  On to the food itself. Here's the problem with doing simple, well-known food: You have to be REALLY freaking good. If you're going to do sandwiches, those better be the kind of sandwiches that make your knees knock, cry out for Jesus, and grip the sheets just to maintain control of your sanity. Suffice to say, my nipples didn't even get hard.  The crab cakes were a conundrum. They were made by someone who had heard of the concept of a crab cake, tried one from the frozen food section, and then decided to whip one up. Granted, I know you'll say, \"But Jennifer, why on earth would you order a crab cake in a sandwich place?\" BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON A MENU, IT BETTER BE AMAZING. And I love crab cakes. There might have been crab in it. I don't know. The outside was crispy, the inside looked like something someone had put through the blender, froze, and then put it through the blender again. What was interesting though, was that the flavor was delicious. If I convinced myself I had ordered crab pate, I would have been delighted. The right combination of savory and spicy, the flavor itself was robust and held its own. The only mildly redeeming moment on the waitress' behalf was that the manager took it off the bill when I mentioned it had a horrible texture. And then she told me it was a common complaint. THEN WHY HASN'T THIS BEEN FIXED?! Again, where are the leaders in this place?  The corn salsa deserves it's own special little paragraph. You know the taste when you don't completely clean off a charcoal grill before using it again two weeks later? Yeah. The corn salsa tasted like that. G. R. O. S. S.   I also had the mushroom burger. I asked for medium and got rare. Which really isn't a problem in my book, but I have to wonder how many people ask for medium, get rare, and then die in horror (because, quite frankly, Americans eat most foods WAY over cooked). Again, piss-poor communication in the kitchen and zero quality control. Is there even a chef back there? I'll even take a pretend chef  as long as he or she actually looks at the food going out! The bread was mush, the cheese had long solidified, and the fries were either soggy or tasted like they had been refried from the night before. The best thing on the plate was the slaw. It was crisp, vinegary, and actually quite nice. I could eat a bucket of that stuff if you let me.    So. Yeah. It was my first visit to Melt, and it will most definitely be my last. I'm not looking for a 5-star meal from a sandwich place, but I am looking for a decent meal. When I start looking longingly at the Dairy Queen sign reflecting in the window and view it as a sign of HOPE, only to have my soul crushed when I realized there is no DQ near by and it's actually hanging in the restaurant....yeah, that's bad."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches.  Don't go if you plan on getting on a scale anytime soon, as I don't believe there is a single healthy option.  Sometimes, you've just got to go for it and this place is just where to do it.  I've had several different options, and love the breakfast burger and the parmageddon most of all.  They have the BEST hand cut fries I've ever had and give you enough for 3 people.  I've never been able to make it to dessert but have seen some pretty incredible things walk by.  There is always a wait, but if you get there a couple minutes before they open, you have a decent shot at being seated quickly.  Once you are seated, service is good.  Great concept, great execution."}
{"text":"Not very happy. The past few times I've done pickup orders, they've been wrong. When I called the person argued with me saying she packed it herself and they were in there. Funny. I was looking at the sandwich and coleslaw that was supposed to have fries and extra sauce (which I paid for). I don't think I'll be ordering any time soon."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat once in a while. It is what it is....gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches with really great fries. The barmaid had some great suggestions for additional toppings."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for business (Blodgett Welding Seminar at Lincoln Electric); I was told to visit this place.    Okay, ...so I wasn't told, so much as ...I enjoy Guy Fieri.  They were also on \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" recently.  I was sold on the premise.   Surprisingly enourmous boozahol selection; no complaints there. The wait (at ~7pm) was going to be 45 minutes for a booth; no wait for the bar area.  (This makes sense, as the bar is abnormally large ...and appears to make up roughly 60% of the square footage.)  Portions are very generous. Service was very good: despite the \"45 minute wait to be seated,\" I had my food in under 10 minutes. At the suggestion of the gentleman behind the bar, I had the \"Parmageddon.\"  (Parma is apparently a largely eastern-European suburb of Cleveland; makes for quality kielbasa and pierogies and the like.) Grilling pierogies apparently makes a world of difference from what I've had before.  And the kraut or cabbage (?) was pretty brilliant - the kind of stuff that would outshine the corned beef in a reuben.  (Sacrilege to say, but true.)   Not bad, Cleveland.  I didn't get to see a butter cow.  But not bad."}
{"text":"We came in to Ohio from New York and were looking forward to trying Melt. We went for lunch and to start we had the pierogi and the ultimate fries. Both were very flavorful  We then ordered the monte cristo, municipal stadium magic (bratwurst,) and black bean soup. The plates that came out were overflowing with food. The sandwiches had the perfect mix of various flavors and were delicious. We couldn't even finish them because we were so stuffed but we had lunch for the next day!  And there is a very impressive list of beers!"}
{"text":"Goldfish with tomato soup!  A little salty.  Sandwich was fun.  Good experience."}
{"text":"Having seen the spot on DD and D I wanted to try it. What a great, eclectic and fun place. Thankfully, we were there shortly after the doors opened and didn't have to wait at all, something I understand very rarely happens. This Sunday was the first Sunday that they did not serve brunch, so it seems that the food gods were smiling on us as we made our way into a half emply restaurant. Again, we sensed the pride of ownership, the care that is put into everything that comes out of the kitchen. Some of the friendliest waitstaff we have ever encountered was working while we were there. DH had a hard time deciding but in the end went with the monthly special - the pig roast. . I opted for the Westside Monte Cristo. After about a half hour wait our sandwiches arrived and we happily dug in. Let me warn you - the sandwiches are huge. And every bit as good as everyone says. The fries are great - hand cut with partial skins on them, super crispy and perfect with a light amount of seasoning. They do not skimp on anything here at Melt. The love of food shines through. As was said on DD and D they are taking food from 4 and 5 star restaurants and putting in sandwich form, something everyone is comfortable with. We were a little afraid of the long wait and it almost kept us from coming - I am so glad that we made up our minds to try it regardless of the wait. Why was this an amazing meal? The waitstaff - they all were so friendly and really wanted us to be pleased with our experience. The everybody-knows-your-name-neighborhood bar feeling we had from the time we walked in until the time we left. Oh, and those amazing sandwiches."}
{"text":"Pretty great place for sandwiches. I had the buffalo chicken.  The only downside was the blue cheese was a little over powering but still very good.   Hit the gym after you eat here, a single lunch is enough calories for one day."}
{"text":"Omg. This place was great!  While you may have to edit a bit longer then most places but it's worth it. Interesting decor while the menus come on old LP albums. It is definitely a place to comeback and try the various selects of grilled cheeses."}
{"text":"Delicious.  We were very lucky for a Friday night visit, in that we only had to wait 15 minutes, tops, for a table.  My sandwich was delicious, and lived up to the hype everyone gave it once they heard I was going to Cleveland.  I'm excited that Melt is opening a location in Columbus soon.  The prices are super reasonable and the service was fast and reliable.  I particularly liked the way they get your name, which is to have you pick a name tag from the pumpkin.  Clever and funny!"}
{"text":"My friends took me here. What a cool place. So original, eclectic and different. Menu on the other side of  old records. The Muriel on the wall when you walk in with all the celebs is great. Service was good and the food and drinks priced well.  The sandwiches were fine. The fries are the absolute worst in the nation and the coleslaw they schlop on the plate is inedible.  Otherwise its nice. I REALLY don't know who eats those deliberately burnt fries but I didn't. The Monte Cristo is a perfect way to cheat if you're on an atkins diet because there are so many carbs until you cant count them. LOL.  I have to say though that i thought i was at a biker restaurant as the entire staff has tattoos everywhere. I have 3 so I am not one of those kind of people. It was excessive. I mean, i guess its to be expected as it is to sandwiches what Red Robin is to burgers. My server was pretty cool though. He actually had a cool tattoo of a old school Nintendo joystick.   I guess my final review is that its a nice sandwich place/ upscale bar."}
{"text":"So you're not from town and you come in here let me tell you what you're getting into. Sit down. This will be a second. You woke up this morning and you said what a good day to die from a heart attack. I mean you're a gambling man the Cleveland clinic is afterall right here anyway right ? So you mosey on down to melt because while the name is melt all it can do is clog your arteries... And boy does it do that in the most decadent delicious way possible.   Now you're for some crazy reason a vegetarian they have a plenty vegetarian ways to accomplish your decided task of clogging your blood vessels. Oh did you say gluten free... They got you covered too. I almost feel like this place probably has a cardiology group running it making it the least healthy as possible.   Did someone say portion size? Well this is 'murica and nothing is going small here. These sammiches here make America great again or is it grate for the cheese that's on here I dunno and honestly I don't care.    The wait staff was friendly to a fault but then again it's your last meal right cuz if your heart did not explode your stomach will once you stuffed that sandwich down. Foolish you, ordered appetizers!!! Don't! Starve for a day, better still make it two, because that is how much food there is for this thing.   Full bar but don't expect a vieux carre or anything but hey full bar and besides this is a sandwich shop! Excellent beer selection though. Remember there's always space for beer.   Not bad but let's be honest Cleveland it's not that great either.   Flip side Fries were kinda sucky and place could use some cleaning."}
{"text":"Wow! Huge sandwiches. A lot to offer. Great decor. A great addition to Cleveland. Mushroom melt and Municipal Stadium Magic are awesome. Clean, great service, priced right. Nice area of the city! We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  It's an ooey gooey, cheesy take on every type of sandwich you can imagine.  There's a special each month.  I wish there was one here in Raleigh, NC."}
{"text":"Cheese heavy dishes with craft beers, yes please.   If you are a fan of any variation of cheese and starch expect your itch to be scratched. The amount and quality of comfort food is commendable. The bar tenders have a pulse on what craft beers are hot and new. The portions are huge, so eat half and take half for later."}
{"text":"I have now been to this location twice and it is fantastic! The first visit I got the Wakin Bacon and it is amazing. The sandwiches come with a huge pile of fries and coleslaw. I am a coleslaw fan, but not of theirs. That is the only complaint you will get from me for this place. The second visit I got the Peanut Butter & Banana. Believe it or not, this is one of the top 3 sandwiches I've ever had. I LOVE it!! I asked them to hold the coleslaw this time around. Definitely worth visiting if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I really LOVE the concept of this place...I mean...Grilled Cheese? Who doesn't love an amazing grilled cheese? My issue is with the execution of said grilled cheeses. The menu is beyond a little ridiculous and having just had one of their special's (TMNT Cowabunga), I don't think I'd try another one. It was just way too much, and I really feel like I missed out on eating something way better. I don't even much care for the bread that they use...its way too thick for a sandwich, in my humble opinion (and I am very humble). The atmosphere of the place was super cool and  the servers were very friendly. Overall, I loved the concept, but was disappointed with the execution, though I'd definitely go back and try it again to see if I can find anything better."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are huge and there is so many to select from and if that doesn't appeal to you, there is whole other list and you can create your own. I wanted to try to their creation and waitress recommended the Mushroom Melt and their special the reuben.  I love the bread and it was buttery, crispy, and just like a texas toast.  The mushroom were good but after the 3 bit the onion got to sweet for me. I moved on to the Reuben and it was really good not the best I have had but the bread was the best part. The fries are good and I was not a fan of the cole slaw, kinda bland. The girl scout chocolate mint breading pudding was really good. I like the idea of the place but my  artery was not so happy and I felt full until Lunch the next day."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese melt in december is amazing! Love the food but I do have a couple bad experiences. Mostly because when you order to-go over the phone, Ive have more times then I can count where they say a hour and when I come to pick it up I have to wait another 20 or so more minutes. Not enough to not come back but would be nice to try and fix that!"}
{"text":"wow. I am still in awe (days layer) of my lunch at Melt. I came into Cleveland on business and my friend would not stop talking about Melt.  I had high expectations walking in and I was not disappointed!  the decor was cheesy (no pun intended) but fitting. the menu choices were varied. I came in expecting just a bunch of grilled cheese options but there was plenty more. amazing salads, soups that sounded fantastic, a daily special vegetable (that days was roasted corn on the cob with garlic butter-yum!), a wide array of sandwiches and even vegan options.   I had to have a grilled cheese. I ordered the Wake 'n Bacon with added avocado. it was divine. they serve their sandwiches with fries and coleslaw. I subbed out for a salad. I never even touched the fries and only ate half of my sandwich and was completely satisfied.   an added bonus-a really awesome selection of microbrewed sodas (LOTS of root beer-my fave) and what looked like a rotating menu of beers.   I cannot wait for my next trio to Cleveland and I NEVER thought I'd say that about Cleveland of all places."}
{"text":"This place was recommended for a good place to eat in Cleveland,  and I most admit that all the choices on the menu sounded good. I went with the  monthly special, Smokey & the Riblet."}
{"text":"How can Melt only have 4 stars?   This veg-friendly place does get packed, but you can easily make new friends and grab one of their insane selections of beers. I opted for a delish hefe and our group of 7 settled in at the bar and wound up just eating there. The food was absolutely incredible. I built my sammy with portabella mushrooms and roasted red peppers and pesto. The sandwich is huge, and for being a stick figure, I plowed through my sandwich and 1/2 of my friend's, It was just... that good. Any selection that isn't a sandwich is delicious as well.   The bartenders were extremely accommodating despite the rush, and we were extremely pleased with the timely service and crazy decor. It's a fun place to chill, and even better place to eat. Though going to a ghetto strip club afterward made the night even more memorable. (Note: to enjoy Melt, visiting a strip club is not necessary.)"}
{"text":"We've been to Melt about 10 Times now and the quality is always consistent. Today I ordered the Cowabunga, a pizza roll grilled cheese sandwich and added pepperoni. The pepperoni honestly made the sandwich. It was pretty messy, but worth it. My husband got the Cuban war pig and he said it was a good flavor with a kick from the fried pickle. The service was a little slow, but we didn't mind."}
{"text":"I really didn't care for it at all,I waited an hour only to be meet by a server \"whom I thought on some sort of drug\" he did not write our orders down and messed all four of them up,the food was very greasy but I didn't mind,the portion was huge so the good want to bad at all,I give it I e star for the service and experience,"}
{"text":"The Melt is awesome! We lucked out & arrived early so we didn't have to wait. I miss the crab cake sandwich & the shrimp one too! I tried the chicken & waffles one & it was delicious. I really liked the sriracha butter!"}
{"text":"This place is bull shit it's taken 50 min for a Togo order I'm sitting at not been spoken to by a single dumb employee"}
{"text":"This place is overrated and not worth a 2hr wait for a friggin grilled cheese- sorry! My family politely disagrees with me but I hold firm to my standards of service when it comes to dining out and this location meets none of them."}
{"text":"Back at Melt again. This time had the chicken pot pie sandwich; that's right a chicken pot pie in s sandwich! It tastes as good as out sounds, just like your mom used to make. Fries were great as always too, hot and salty."}
{"text":"First off this place is Loud- really loud. If you go with friends prepare to have to bellow over the music, or give up on conversation.   Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, and the drinks are great, both the beers, and mixed drinks.   Their food is not my favourite though. All but 3-4 of the sandwiches have some fried thing as a component, and call me crazy but I like to have jalapeno poppers, and onion rings outside of my sandwich, not inside. Their sandwiches are made on Texas toast, I don't know if this means you should be more excited about it- for me it throws off the ratio of bread to fillings in a sandwich. Because of the massive bread slices, and fairly generous fillings, this is a knife and fork kind of sandwich affair (got no problems with this- just doesn't jive all that well with the beer and grease vibe they have going).   My roast beef sandwich was fine, if nothing to rave about. The chips we go on the side were rather salty. The portions are huge, so my husband and I shared a sandwich. We had a nice evening there but I don't think I shall be going back."}
{"text":"Had \"the dude abides\" and it was delicious. Came nowhere close to finishing it but damn it was good. i would totally make the. 9 hour trip from virginia to cleveland just to eat here again."}
{"text":"Omigosh, I love this place! Who doesn't love grilled cheese?!! The decor is funky, the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the drinks are on point.   I ordered the Lake Erie Monster and wasn't disappointed. It contained 2 pieces of battered and fried cod with a sweet slaw, and American cheese. The jalapeno tartar dipping sauce is genius. I'm so thankful I only ordered a half sandwich and still I took half of it home. The thing was huge.  Instead of fries, my friend and I ordered the seasonal sides to share. We received a bowl of Melt's own macaroni salad and a bowl of smoky chipotle corn. Both were fabulous.  If you get the chance, you should see if Vincenza can be your server. She is the perfect blend of knowledge, attentiveness, and friendliness without hovering too much or making you feel like you are taking too long.  I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Melt Bar and Grilled, and this location made a believer out of me.  THIS LOCATION.  Not the Parma one.  I was three days into a week long route changing air conditioner filters, it had been a cold wet day, I was tired, grubby, and achy.  It was about 8:30 in the evening, so the crowd had thinned out.  My coworker and I lurked in the lobby figuring out what we wanted for about 10 minutes.  As soon as we stepped into the restaurant, the hostess made me and the guy I was with feel at home.  She told us all about the menu, made recommendations, and talked with us about the difference between a big city like Cleveland and our little podunk hometown of 800 people and no traffic lights.  We then went to the bar, where we talked with the bartender and drank water (graciously provided) until our food was ready.  I had a mad scientist's concotion called the TNMT Cowabunga - fried pizza rolls, herbed cream cheese, pesto, marinara, and two other kinds of cheese I can't remember off the top of my head.  My coworker had the Cleveland Cheesesteak.  We took it back to the room, and it was glorious.  I had to use my face to help keep my sandwich together and it went all over my hands in the process, but it was SO GOOD.  I couldn't have been happier with the entire experience and this location has made a believer out of me.  The Parma location though, not so much... not so much, AT ALL..."}
{"text":"I went to the Melt in Mentor, and it made such a great impression that I ate at a different Melt - this one - the next day.  If I'd started at this one, I'd have never given the chain another look.  The second star is for the guy who took the orders - he was nice enough.  Not helpful in the same way the lady who took the orders at the Mentor location was, he just wrote down the orders.  Now, for context, the Cleveland Cavs/Indiana Pacers playoff game was on, the teams were tied 3/3 in the series, and there were 2 minutes left in the 4th quarter, so I was a little distracted.  Another guy, don't know if he was the manager or just another waiter, said to the order taker, \"make sure they pay.\"  He said it loudly, and accompanied it with a death glare.  I was more interested in the game and it didn't really register with me until later how rotten that guy had been.  Then we got the sandwiches.  I got the same TMNT Cowabunga (deep fried pizza rolls, herbed cream cheese, two other kinds of cheese I can't remember, basil pesto and marinara), just like I got at the Mentor location.  These guys served the sandwich lukewarm and forgot the cream cheese entirely.  The guy I was with said they made his sandwich right, but also failed to get it very warm.  The coleslaw that we got with our sandwiches was dry.  Two stars for mediocre half-warm food, minus one for the terribly rude individual."}
{"text":"I used to love Melt because they had lots of allergen-friendly options, but not anymore. Last night I went out with my boyfriend and long story short, they assured me my sandwich was dairy free, but I ended up being lied to and fed dairy. Do not trust Melt with your allergens unless you are ready to get sick for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Like the original location, the food is greasy and cheesy. It never fails that I THINK I can eat the whole sandwich, but rarely make it past the first half.   Also like the Lakewood location...be prepared to wait. A long time. A long, long time. Don't walk in when you are already starving, or you will get very frustrated and your stomach may begin to digest itself. Go a little bit BEFORE you are hungry, so you are \"just right\" when you finally get to your table. :) In other words, plan ahead. Don't just drop in and expect to get a table.  Now, if you are willing to be flexible...both the bar AND the long counter against the far wall are first-come, first-served. I put my name in, then watch like an eagle for seats to open at one of those places. Usually gets me a seat within 30 minutes instead of 1.5 hours.  I've tried the parmageddon (pierogies and cheese, plus vodka slaw), but would probably not order again since the slaw contained my arch-nemesis...caraway seeds.  This trip, I ordered the mushroom melt. Portabellos, caramalized onions and provolone. Really good, but be warned it has a  LOT of mushroom flavor. I would have liked it much better with some additional flavor. (I might get the Cleveland Cheesesteak next visit...which is the same, plus flank steak).  For those with families...no kids menu is available, but I ordered one Kindergardener and split it among two 5-year olds. Perfect.   Planning out my next visit already! :)"}
{"text":"I have wanted to go here since my brother moved to Cleveland a year ago and finally I got my chance!.   Think about the best grilled cheese sammich or any sammy for that matter you have ever had and multiply it by 100 and you will have Melt!  Flavorful and dangerously delicious. I tried 2 different kinds and neither one disappointed. Can't wait to try the others.   My thoughts on the 2 I tried:  Parma, Italy: \"crispy breaded chicken breast, sun-dried tomato pesto, roasted garlic, provolone\" - The chicken was so juicy and tender..a great crunch. The pesto was the perfect amount and had a great flavor.   Smokey Russian: \"smoked turkey, fresh napa vodka kraut, sautéed onions , smoked gouda, russian dressing\" -The thing I loved about this one was they put the dressing on the side. I luv dipping! lol. Everything was a perfect match together on there. Juicy turkey,super tasty kraut.  -1 star for messing up our order :/"}
{"text":"We heard how wonderful the food was so it was the first place we went to when we arrived in Cleveland.   We went  to the original location which was a cool place. The menu was on the back of old record covers.  Very cool.  We asked the waitress what to order.  She wasn't very helpful and we checked on the reviews on Yelp.  Still we weren't sure what we had to get.  We ordered 1/2 sandwiches.  Meatball grilled cheese and Cleveland cheesesteak. The meatball grilled cheese was dry. It needed more marinara sauce. I asked for some and was charged .75.  The bread wa so thick we couldn't eat it.  The Cleveland Philly had a funny taste to it.  I didn't like it at all besides there was no meat or veggies on it.  The best thing was the homemade chips and the onion dip. We were charged $3.00 for the dip.  Just so you know they charge per refill on the drinks.  If you combined the two halves sandwiches to make one sandwich and we had no liquor, the bill was still $34.00.  I had heard this place was featured on Diners, Drivens and Dives.  What did he eat?  Couldn't be what we ate!"}
{"text":"Try Melt, you will not be disappointed!  One of the best sandwiches places in the US."}
{"text":"I went to this location instead of the other one which is closer to my side of the city hoping that, just maybe, the wait time wouldn't be as ridiculously long. You see, I am a Melt fanatic, but even the cheesiest fan has a hard time waiting 2 hours to eat with 2 kids in tow. Unfortunately, this location had just as long a wait as the other.   This time I ordered 'The Dude Abides' - a sandwich packed with deep-fried cheese sticks, marinara, and meatballs. It was previously a monthly special that was brought back due to popular demand. My wife got the West Side Montecristo (her fall-back option, which is, in my opinion, their best sandwich). I thought my Dude Abides was a fantastically good idea and overall was very tasty but I found the meatball to be very dry. I think that if I get it again I will ask for extra sauce in case the meat comes out dry again.  Our server was slightly unfriendly, but since she was very attractive, I will choose to overlook her less-than-awesome attitude. Besides, most people don't go to Melt for the service - heck, after waiting for 2 hours to eat, you'll be begging for them to just throw it at you.  So, long story short, Melt is always tasty... I just wish that they could manage to feed my family without having to make it a whole evening event."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Melt simply because the whole idea of it is something we had to try. We saw it on DDD (Food Channel) and went while on a trip to Cleveland.  Keeping it short, I thought the food was incredible and the atmosphere is very fun. I love a good grilled cheese and the certainly know how to turn it into a gourmet meal. I had the Parmageddon and my wife had the Westside Monte Cristo. Both were fabulous but my wife's was better in my opinion. The berry preserves were AWESOME!   The only thing that kept me from rating it 5-stars is that the wait to eat is ridiculous. We went around 1pm and there was only one couple ahead of us. We waited an hour to be seated and then over 45 minuted for our food to come to the table after that. The food was good but I'd have a hard time justifying the time it takes to eat there on a frequent basis.  Oh, and avoid the bathrooms at all costs! They smell like outhouses and look just as bad. In fact they are so seedy that they are very reminiscent of rape nightmares and it appears as if they encourage graffiti in the stalls... which give very descriptive narratives of what will occur in said rape nightmares."}
{"text":"Since I'm in the neighborhood I had give this Melt another chance. We stopped by on Monday night and since business had slowed to a crawl it made for impeccable service. The server/bartender that took care of us, though I can't remember her name, was incredibly sweet, efficient and quite personable too boot.   The food was as I remembered, oily, HOT and delicious. Also, for the first time ever, our food was brought out in less than 20 minutes! There may be hope for this location after all."}
{"text":"Been wanting to stop in here for sometime but never got a round to it. On this particular visit I had already eaten an hour before but was wanting something else so decided to pop in. The first thing you'll notice is the eclectic art work all over the place, gives a cool, hipsterish vibe.   The food....oh man...the food!!!! I didn't know prior to me going in but this place was featured on Diners, Dives and Drive-ins (or whatever the show is called). After speaking with the bartender I decided to go with the Korean War Pig. IT.WAS.AMAZING! If you're a fan of Korean food than this would be the equivalent to eating a Korean restaurant smashed between two perfectly toasted texas toast. The sandwich had marinated pork, kimchi, pork belly, cheese and all sorts of other goodness. The sandwiches are HUGE but there is an option to do a half instead of a whole.   Had the fries which were perfectly seasoned, hot and crispy.   Another thing to note is that on Tuesday they have a kids deal for only 2.00! Don't quote me on that even though I'm pretty sure that's accurate.   I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I love coming home to Cleveland especially now that this place exists. I can't describe to you how amazing this food is, you just need to go find out for yourself."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have eaten here twice when I am in town. They have some of the best grilled cheeses. A lot of great choices it's hard to decide. Next time I'm in Cleveland I will definitely eat here again.   Prices are very good for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a had a very good experience. Overall this restaurant was delicious! I ordered a lemonade to drink, half of the Kindergarten grilled cheese with American cheese, cup of tomato soup, and fries. The bread on the sandwich was so yummy and I loved it, but the cheese on the inside was kind of hard and not a melted consistency like I expected which made me upset. My fries were absolute delicious. The soup had onion and cheese on top and it was thicker than normal tomato soup, it was so unique and different from any tomato soup I'd ever eaten and I loved it. And last but not least, as a person who orders lemonade everywhere she goes, this was one of the best lemonades I've had in awhile! Would totally recommend this restaurant to everyone who is a fan of grilled cheese because they have such a variety of options of what to get on the sandwich and it was overall very good."}
{"text":"Why can't this place be in Morrisville, NC?  Because then I'd be fat that's why.  This was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever eaten.  It was made on super thick bread, loaded with bacon, and had just the right amount of melted cheddar cheese.  I could only eat half of my sandwich and that made me sad, but the other half was good later.  Next trip to Cleveland will include another stop at Melt."}
{"text":"Came here because I have friends who always mention how good it is. The menu is on the back of an old record case, with small print so bring a magnifine glass if your site isn't that good. There's many different types of imported beers and cheesy foods. A basic grilled cheese sandwhich is overpriced."}
{"text":"I am really glad that Melt does not have a location in Washington DC...if they did, then I would want to eat there every day.  And probably die of a heart attack within the year.  A few of us made a stop here for a Sunday brunch before driving out of town.  We got there just after 11 and it was fairly empty when we arrived, though by the time we were done it was fairly busy.  Everything on the menu sounded amazing, which is terrible when you have to pick just one.  Luckily, I was visiting with a party of 3, so we were able to get 3 different sandwiches and try them all.  I ordered the War Pig \"Cuban Style\", which was a grilled cheese with three different kinds of pig and deep fried pickles.  I also got to try the New Bomb Turkey was a thanksgiving dinner in a grilled cheese and the monthly special, which was a double decker grilled cheese with meatloaf.  Each sandwich also same with a small mountain of perfectly cooked french fries.  All three sandwiches were delicious, but I think that my favorite was probably the War Pig, though the fried pickles got to be a little too much as I got towards the end of the sandwich.  The portions are ridiculous.  The bread for the grilled cheeses is as thick as french toast, and they pile the fillings on just as thick, if not more.  My sandwich (plus a good portion of my fries) was plenty for brunch, and I was still full at dinnertime.  Great and friendly service, and I really liked all of the random signs and holiday decorations inside.  I did not try any of the beers while I was there, but the bar has a huge draft selection to go with their huge portions.  Next time I am in Cleveland, I'll definitely have to stop by a Melt location again."}
{"text":"Nice chain, I wish they had them around New England as the idea and the food is great. Plenty of beer options, plenty of meal options. I had \"The Dude Abides\" and it was tasty, meatballs and lots of cheese with it. People think of grilled cheese as a kids meal but they do it right, I got a \"half\" as I was still pretty full from lunch and it was plenty, it comes with fries and I couldn't even finish them."}
{"text":"Awesome decor. If you're from the Cleveland area, you'll love it. Even if you're not from the area, the interior will probably harken back to your days as a mid-80's child, with its molded plastic holiday decor and arcade displays mounted over the counters. The food is awesome. I had the \"Dude Abides\" sandwich, which has a meatball, mozzarella sticks, and a whole lot of grated Parmesan. It was outstanding. We had a really good time. Impressive beer selection."}
{"text":"This is a Cleveland/Lakewood MUST. It's on my list of places I take people when they are visiting Cleveland. The food is awesome and the atmosphere is super fun. This is the original location and it definitely feels that way. The wait times are usually long (expect to wait at least an hour during peak times), but it's worth every second. Plus, the bar has great local beers on tap for while you wait. The grilled cheeses are HUGE and can easily be split. For a lighter alternative, try the brussels sprout salad."}
{"text":"thank you Man Vs Food for giving me a destination to hit up during my tour of Ohio - though we went to this location since it's right near my one cousin's house, not the Cleveland one.  was the wait for seating an hour? yes. was the wait for food an hour? yes. was the food delicious? fuck and yes.  the sandwiches here are similar to the grease trucks of Rutgers (from what I have heard, never actually been) in that you take something basic and pile every fucking combination of unhealthy food onto it.  I had the Parmageddon: 2 potato & cheese pierogi, fresh napa vodka kraut, grilled onions, sharp cheddar. ten bucks seems like a lot to pay for a grilled cheese sandwich, but these are ridiculously huge (on Texas toast bread).  the fresh-cut fries are perfectly seasoned, and the cole slaw is an interesting combination of sweet and spicy. these are included in the price of the sandwiches (which range from 5 to about 11 dollars).  would I come back? hells yes. I didn't have a cardiac arrest, though I did pass out in the car ride back home, so let's call this a win.  check out my photo of the PARMAGEDDON!"}
{"text":"Delicious and large portions. Deep fried pickles are great as an appetizer. I had the  mushroom melt and the caramelized onions were sweet and plentiful."}
{"text":"Good place to stop for a high end grilled cheese.   Sandwiches are large so go for a half not a whole.  Plenty of special beers on tap, but not the usual stuff. The best part about this place was the service.  Very pleasant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! We live an hour away and it is a rare treat to come here, but it is worth it. They have a wonderful beer list, a welcoming atmosphere, and good food. Lots of bang for your buck as well. We've almost never left without a take-out box."}
{"text":"Passing through. Asked a friend from Cleveland where to eat and this was his first response.  Lots of menu choices. We had the  Monte Cristo. Deep fried sandwich with berry dipping sauce. This sandwich is huge. All of the sandwiches are large. I know I could eat a whole one but I am glad we split it.  Large beer selection as well."}
{"text":"This is our second time at Melt and again we very much enjoyed our food had the Parma Italy and it was cooked well and had a nice garlic bread taste to the bread could have used more seasoning on the chicken though. The fries were especially good but almost better than the food was my drink, a Apple Martini, but with apple cider and whipped cream on top, fantastic!"}
{"text":"The SCOOP... Not bad. But needs improvement.  The bread they use on their sand. are too thick.  I think they have to justify a $9.00 peanut butter and jelly  and banana sand. The bread does not work for this Sandwich. Also ordered melt pierogi.  You get 2 for $5.50. Not recommended. Over-Priced. I also had another sand. but can't remember it.. It was forgetable. But worht a visit and you make up your own mind."}
{"text":"Melt is as popular and tasty as everyone says.  However, it's not as grilled cheese as I expected.  I would say that they specialize in grilled sandwiches with cheese.  I didn't see a single sandwich that looked like a grilled cheese sandwich to me.  I expect cheese to be the dominant ingredient of a grilled cheese and that's simply not the case at Melt.  This is only a negative to me because it's false advertising, I actually preferred that they weren't overly cheesy.  I loved the walleye sandwich that I ordered.  I added the garlic which really gave it a nice punch.  The fries are very good.  Hand cut, dark, and crispy.  The slaw that comes with the sandwiches is so-so.    The beer selection was very good (calibrated for Cleveland).  Although, as an out of towner, I would have like to see more local beers.  I could only find 1 Great Lakes beer and 1 Bells on tap.  They had 4-5 different Stone beers on tap.  Don't get me wrong - Arrogant Bastard is one of my favorite beers, but common have some pride Cleveland!  The Bells IPA that I had was delicious, I would have love to have more Bells or GLBC options.  I fell for the hipster style of this place.  It made me feel back at home in Seattle.  The menus are pasted to the back of LP covers.  We were all comparing which band we got from Jethro Tull to Marvin Gay.     Oh, and no joke on the wait - we waited over an hour.  As long as you're ready for that wait, it's worth it.  Don't show up when you're already starving."}
{"text":"Ok, we went to Melt on Sunday, my wife was very excited to try melt.  Needless to say we were very disappointed.  We went to the hostess and asked how long the wait would be, she replied at least 45 minutes!  This normally wouldn't be a problem for us, except that I counted at least 12 open tables inside and even more outside.    They really missed the boat here, why not seat people explain the kitchen is backed up, maybe at this point they will sell a beer or two while the people wait?    Well we ended up going elsewhere.  I will probably try this place  after they get the kinks out."}
{"text":"The food never dissapoints, the service and staff are always on their game... it's just the wait.  I love this place, but going more than every other month or so becomes a chore when you have to wait over an hour or more each time to get a table..."}
{"text":"Good Sandwich place.   I had the Oct. special: Meatloaf with mashed potatoes (on bread as a melt, of course).   Friendly bartender. Nice beer selection.  Fries are so-so.    I would recommend it to anyone.  I wish they would have the 13 cheese sandwich in the 5 lb challenge on a smaller scale just to try it!   In terms of the wait, go alone and sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"The place is called \"Melt\" ...but my cheese is never melted... My food often takes a long time to arrive...the dinner plate itself is hot to the touch...but the cheese is never melted...I stopped going for the food. I go for great drinks. #frustrating"}
{"text":"Several people recommended melt and I heard the gyro was good and generous but the only thing generous was the amount of bread served. I was very disappointed and will not go back. The restaurant was loud and there was a wait so I opted for carry out. I doubt if I had stayed that it would have been different, but at least I would not have thrown it out."}
{"text":"I'm a clevelander and have been to the Melt Bar and Grilled in Lakewood and loved it. Tonight my girlfriend and I decided to go to the one on my side of town, the Cleveland Heights location. After going to the original (in Lakewood) I would have to say this site seemed manufactured. Seemed like the owner was trying to capitalize on it too quickly. We wanted to get a table but the wait was 45-60 min. For a two top. Ended up at the bar. They have a great selection of beers across the USA. I had a Brooklyn wheat and an anchor steam. A total of 36 beers on draft. My food was good (hot Italian melt), but my girlfriend got the tuna melt and said it was good but didn't come out rare as expected. Service was great. Not pushy or nonexistent either.  Would I go back, yes, but only for the food, not for the decor...your best bet is takeout!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and always try to get something different.  It would take me a long time to go through the entire menu -- especially since they seem to add a 'sandwich of the month' each month.    Great concept, great menu, huge portions, very cool atmosphere . . .   The only downside:  be prepared to wait (and the street parking can be a bitch, too).  Still:  5 stars"}
{"text":"Back in BI (before investors), this was a a quirky experience.  It was different, and the company was committed to quality and employee happiness. Prices were high, but at least there was enough food served for two quality meals - one for now, one for later.    Then came Investors and Expansion.  Quality went out the window - the bread is no longer locally produced and natural; now it's shipped in from Chicago and from the same supplier as McDonald's.  The rest if the ingredients are Sysco or the equivalent.    From quirky and quality to cafeteria and cheap.  If that's the company's new motto, it's exceeding in spades.    Extra star given solely for the blow mold decor."}
{"text":"So I know it's opening weekend..but we waited for 82 minutes for a table and when I went to check on the status ..the hostess told me she had forgot about another list that she had and it was going to be another hour and thirty minutes before we could get seated..we put our names in at 5:16pm and at 6:40pm we still going to have to wait until AFTER 8pm TO EAT ?!?   Folks, this is a BAR..not a restaurant. I counted 20 tables ...for a seating of 150 people? You can order from the menu at the bar...but again the kitchen can't keep up  I don't care how good the food is suppose to be...the service and the way your treated is HORRIBLE. It reminds me of a college bar scene..except your paying for a restaurant experience. Did I mention the parking problem? Yeah, the manager from the KFC across the street was threatening to tow people who parked in his lot   Great spot if you 20-something and have a lot of tattoos ..otherwise wait until the hype is over, and try get a table. Maybe if my wife and I had tattoos all over and multiple piercing ..we would have gotten seated faster"}
{"text":"I'm not going to say anything about how they were going to \"tap into the Akron market\" -- Independence is still 30 minutes from Akron -- but when it comes down to it, you can't find a better sammy in Cleveland.  This is the first location for The Melt in a strip mall, which diverges a bit from its strategy of setting up shop in \"hip\" neighborhoods. Let's face it, there's nothing hip and cool about Independence.  The beer selection cannot be beaten. Matt Fish, the owner of The Melt, is a known beer aficionado. His expertise on cold ones gives The Melt what might be the widest, best-tasting selection of any restaurant in Northeast Ohio.  Most people don't come here for the beer. They come for the food. Grilled cheese is the name of the game, and they are unrivaled when it comes to how good their grilled cheese is. The wait can be longer than an hour. Yes, their food is THAT good.  My favorite is the Parmageddon, an Italian-influenced grilled cheese sandwich with pierogies, vodka-infused parsley, bacon, and cheese. Add a mound of fries and another mound of coleslaw, and you have yourself the largest meal in Cleveland.  Speaking of large meals, try the Melt Challenge. I dare you."}
{"text":"There is ALWAYS a 2 1/2 hour (or longer) wait to get into this location of the Melt; I've heard that even if you have a reservation, you're going to have to wait at least an hour or so.  Being from Akron, I first heard of this place the week before the Cleveland episode of Man v. Food aired.  I decided to make the drive up here to watch said episode at the bar.  Once I fought my way to the bar, I was amazed by the variety of alcohol they serve.  They even list how strong each beer and wine are.  I ended up getting the Arrogant Bastard, and I was in heaven.  I don't really remember much of the Cleveland episode except his monologue at the end of the episode (which had to have been pre-written), so when that happens, you know this is a good place to drink.  The food here matches the hype, in my opinion.  All servings are massive and come loaded with fries and slaw.  I got the Parmageddon my first time here, which comes with pierogies, cheese, and other stuff I can't remember.  I was in love with that sandwich.  The sandwich alone must have weighed over a pound, while the fries and slaw must have added another pound.  Yes, I've also tried the Melt Challenge, and while it was too much for me, it was one of the tastiest challenges I have ever done.  The 13 types of cheese on that each stood out, giving each bite a new flavor that added to the quality of the messy dish.  Just beware:  the fries and slaw take up 3/4 of the plate.  If they ever built a Melt in the Akron area, I would be there every week.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Upsetting to order take out, wait, drive to pick it up and be told oh sorry, we forgot to put your order in, but you know what I'm going to do, I will go to the kitchen and put it in and ask them to rush it. Well gee, I would sure as hell hope so! Then the dipping sauce was missing :("}
{"text":"Meh, defiantly has gone down hill.  Charging more and now smaller portions.  They cut out the coleslaw which was always included, now its a side item.  Sandwiches are much smaller, it used to be 2 meals.  Pop prices are outrageous, when it cost just as much as a cheap beer, there is a problem.    Was here on my birthday,  (Thursday 2/23) my food was warm, not hot, almost as if it was done early and sitting.  The place was not busy for a Thursday, so no real excuse.    Overall, not the experience it used to be.  Seems like the more locations they opened, the more quality went down."}
{"text":"As someone who doesn't like grilled cheese, I was a little nervous about coming here. I've always heard amazing things about it though and my friends really wanted to go. They have a huge list of sandwiches and they're all different! I ordered the Cuban War Pig (without cheese of course) and it still tasted incredible! It actually had fried pickle spears ON THE SANDWICH!  I ordered half of the sandwich but I honestly probably could have eaten the whole, even if they are massive. I left here feeling very full and very satisfied. Everything was great! I will definitely be back if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Foods is always good but the time it took was absolutely terrible. Waited over two hours for food. Will probably never go back to this Melt again!"}
{"text":"I'm rarely so conflicted over a review. I want to give it anywhere from 3 stars to 5 stars, but none of the ratings seem appropriate. * Staff: 5 stars. Very friendly, helpful, patient, knowledgeable, funny. I think Dan was the guy I talked to when I was there. He told me how it all worked, threw in some recommendations, and then another guy stopped by and told me to order drinks from the bar to save on tax. * Location: 4 stars, possibly 5. Right on the main drag through Lakewood, it's really easy to find, and there's parking all over the place. However, the parking is metered. However, I then parked, after searching fruitlessly for a free spot that wasn't permit-only, only to see \"Free time\" on the meter. Wait, how are you metering something for free? I punched the button 3 times while I was there, so I guess as long as you can walk outside to the meter, you're good? Confusing, or else I'd give it 5 stars. * Wait: 3 stars. Unfortunately, popularity leads to wait times, but this place has bad space utilization. There's room for at least 6-8 more people in the dining room, and then all this unused space in the second half of the building where people wait. 5 people wouldn't have to wait an hour at 1 PM on a Sunday if you just had the right number of tables around! Wonder how much business that's lost them. Similarly, I lost a half hour of my travel time just waiting to grab a sandwich to go. So don't expect to go during peak times and get served reasonably, but I imagine it's not so bad off-peak. * Food: 5 stars. Well, come on, they're famous for a reason. Ooey gooey cheese (how have I never typed that in my life before?), gourmet toppings that actually taste gourmet (I had port wine onions, or some kind of liquor, that actually tasted decadent like port wine, or some kind of liquor), and then just to remind you it's still a grilled cheesery above all, crispily pan-fried bread loaded up with butter. I can't downrate for the bread, because it'd just be a regular sandwich with anything else. * Price: 2 stars. Basic grilled cheese is $6. Veggie ones start at $9, and meat ones start at $12. Want to add anything? $1.50 per cheese, $2 or more per anything else. Holy hell. Granted, it's not gourmet, but I can go to the place here in Morristown and get a grilled cheese with all 8 cheeses for $8. Melt doesn't even have mozzarella, just vegan mozz! No good, no good at all. As good as the sandwiches are, and they stack up against any others I've ever had (grilled or otherwise), it's still expensive for a sandwich, especially if you try to customize it. And these aren't sandwiches, they're grilled cheese.  5 star food, but I can't get over how much I have to pay just for grilled cheese. As great as this place is, all I can say now is \"I've tried it.\" I won't be back, not at these prices. If they can maybe drop some of the add-ons down a bit (like, take off $1 from every single one), I would reverse these statements."}
{"text":"So, I am on a business trip and wanted to order food for pick up at the store. Sarah the receptionist said they don't \"Take credit cards\" over the phone. No worries. I will make sure I never go back here again and let all my clients know that they should steer clear as well. I've done this for years at the Lakewood location and never had a problem. Suppose they have gotten to big for their britches. Good bye Melt. Say good bye to all the corporate purchases I have made as well."}
{"text":"Melt is delicious!  I wish I lived closer so I could try all the sandwiches! I had the waken bacon and I was a little disappointed because it taste like a breakfast sandwich.  I don't know what I had expected but I had hoped it would have had a little \"flair\" to it. (Maybe a homemade sauce or something)   The decor is cute! It's pretty much a combination of music and my grandma's basement. Music art, pictures of the city, Halloween decorations, right next to the giant Santa Clause and some graffiti.    They also have half sandwiches in most of the sandwiches so it's a nice lunch portion."}
{"text":"Meatball, mozzarella sticks, and cheese made up the most decadent, perfect sandwich I've ever eaten.  Appropriately called \"The Dude Abides\", a Big Lebowski reference, the sandwich had thick slices of bread, was liberally buttered and was a culinary comfort food masterpiece. Get this sandwich. I paired it with a nice, light hefeweizen beer, which happened to be on special that night.  I came here on a weekend visit over the summer, thanks to a friend's recommendation. It was a busy Saturday night. The wait was nearly an hour, and the service was kinda slow once we were seated, but I think the sandwich made it worth the wait. I was stuffed after eating less than half of it. I was very thankful for leftovers.  Definitely making plans to stop there again next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Wow biggest burgers I have ever seen.the service and people there are great all the time the sandwiches are huge and the food is amazing when I can't finish I can't throw it out always have to take it home"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to Chicago for lunch. It was so good we stopped on the way home again for lunch and then even took melts to go home with.  We need one of these in Washington DC area.  There is nothing like this. Great atmosphere staff was awesome.  Great comfort food... Great for your cheat day during the week."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to go here since I saw it on man v food! I was a little worried about being disappointed because it was so hyped up but I was definitely not disappointed!!!! I ordered the fried green tomato BLT (vegan)! Absolutely amazing and delicious. The staff was very helpful and they had a large selection of craft beers!  The decor was eclectic and cute!"}
{"text":"Late night vegan food - in CLEVELAND?  Well, I have to say - I was very delighted AND impressed!    Not only do they have vegan options but it was VEGAN WEEKEND!  Despite the temptation of vegan bbq pulled \"pork\" - I went for the potato pierogie sandwich - that's right - a big ole potato pierogie with Daiya cheese grilled into fat fluffy slices of house made bread, just grilled crispy enough on the outside and incredibly delicious.   My bestie and I also had the tofu \"hot wings\" - which was one of my favorite fried tofu memories of recent dining.    Melt also had a very impressive beer menu - they even had 5th Amendment beers (Hell or High Watermelon is a local favorite for me at home) and quite a lot of good Belgian style beers.    Did I mention the portions are ENORMOUS?  Pretty good value if you know this in advance - two people can share one appetizer/salad and one sandwich and a beer each, come out for $20 - not at all bad! Of course, leftovers are perfectly fine as well."}
{"text":"Waiting for take away order more than an hour. May 11 2018 Staff promised to give our burger fast"}
{"text":"My God... the best American sized portion gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.. they have a fun tattoo themed atmosphere with over 150 beers... spiced coleslaw along with wonderful fries and never before thought of sandwiches such as the parmageddon topped with a peirogi and sauerkraut! Get in! Waits take forever."}
{"text":"Love Melt and love this new location! I've been to this location 3 times and have never had a bad experience.    It goes without saying, but the food is amazing.  They have several great regular items and the monthly specials often hit it out of the park.  During happy hour, they also have great apps for cheap prices, including fried lasagna bites that are to die for.  The chips and dip are great, as well.  Sandwich portions are generous and I almost always leave with 1/2 a sandwich leftover.  You can get half sizes on regular menu items, but not the special monthly sandwiches.  Our service has always been great.  There is often a wait, even on weekday evenings sometimes, but this is pretty typical for all Melt locations.  This past Sunday, we bypassed the wait by sitting at the full service bar.  (Note: on Sunday, they can only serve beer.)  Additionally, I am an avid ranch lover and think they have the best ranch around.  P.S. might I suggest some sort of ranch lovers monthly special?"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't get it here. Everybody in my party raved about their meal but I found it to be just a grilled cheese on very thick bread. I'll stay home next time."}
{"text":"Great big sandwiches!! If that's your thing this is a place for you. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was awesome. Along with the sandwiches the beer list is great. Very good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"For all you haters in Cleveland, there's a joint in Chicago called Kuma's Corner which is basically your Melt but with burgers. Two hour waits are because of hype, not the restaurant's servers or even kitchen's pace. Believe me when I say that they probably want to turn the tables over a lot more than you do.  With that said, we walked in on a Sunday morning around 11:30 with a group of seven and sat right down. Coffees and a few beers ordered, our server was really friendly and patient with a sleepy, larger group. It took us a while to make our decisions, but I went with the Purple Parma ($12?, eggplant parm, basically). I can see why it takes so long to order, you have like, 25 grilled cheese options to sift through and they all look pretty amazing. My sandwich was really good. Seasoned just right, hot and steaming, and gives my own eggplant parm a run for its money.  Everyone got something different and they were all huge. Only my buddy had the right idea and got the split - a half grilled cheese and salad. She barely finished hers and none of us finished ours. It's A LOT of food.  We had a great experience and by the time we left around 1:30, the wait was on. I was delighted to see that their wait system is pretty cute (they call you out by the name on a sticker which you're given, as opposed to your actual name thus eliminating line-jumpers). Ours was \"pepper\" with a little pepper shaker dawn just so, and my friend was \"The Log Lady\", which means something to only a very few people left in the world.  Since I'm moving to Cleveland soon, I'm sure I'll be seeing more of Melt but given how much food it winds up being I suspect it will be a long time between visits."}
{"text":"it's soooo good, but so unhealthy...but still sooooo good.  service is awesome, ambience is really hipster cool, food comes out fast.  It's so unhealthy though...so fatty, and heavy...but so darn good"}
{"text":"We try to stop here every time we're in Cleveland. Service has always been quick, friendly and helpful. Food is great and serving sizes are huge! Never had a bad meal"}
{"text":"Really interesting menu and place. Loved the album menus. Really enjoyed the decor. Food was good."}
{"text":"In town on business and my hotel recommended Melt. Phenomenal beer selection but the food and atmosphere were just okay. I'm not sure why they recommended a place with families and kids when I was looking for more of an adult scene. As for food, I chose the Korean War Pig. The flavor was good but in general, just a huge sandwich with 1\" thick bread slices. I've never seen a bigger sandwich. Ate as much as I could but couldn't take the rest home as I was leaving the next day. I looked around and don't think anyone finished their food. The super sized proportions are unnecessary and wasteful."}
{"text":"Yeah, that was a TON of food. Definitely recommend getting a half portion. I had the Parmageddon grilled cheese sandwich which featured pierogis, vodka kraut, and sautéed onions. Delicious! This place has a very wide selection of sandwiches and beer. The price for the amount of food is very reasonable. Again, most people could go for the half portion, making entree+side less than $10. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Oh no she isn't..  Oh yes she is!   That's right. I'm doing it. I'm writing a review of Melt! *GASP! (The world just screeched to a halt)  I can hear the whispering already. Well guess what? I like Melt. There. I said it. If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would. Please do yourself a favor and go into this restaurant with the notion that you're getting a SANDWICH, not a elegant, 5-start meal. Notice out front that the sign doesn't say, Blue Point.   I feel like Melt has been getting a lot of backlash from it's own backyard since it's popularity spiked. It's a grilled cheese sandwich restaurant, people. And an innovative, locally-owned one at that. I'm proud. Do I think it should get more publicity than our amazing orchestra, art museum and many other incredible CLE attractions? No. But folks are seeing a positive side of Cleveland and I, for one, am very happy about it. The world is getting a glimpse into our city's creatives, innovative entrepreneurs and talent. So, how is that a negative again?   The Lakewood and the Cleveland Heights locations have both given me the same, great experiences. Yes, I waited too. I also starved to death and died. Oh that's right, no I didn't! Grab a seat at the bar and you'll cut your time by 75%. On my most recent visit to the Heights location, I walked in at lunch and there was no wait. Keep in mind that Melt is a popular restaurant. It's just good to see a Cleveland business doing so well!  The food? Well, it is delicious! And by delicious, I mean a melty, cheesey, comforting indulgence that might make you feel a little guilty for not running the day before (or ever, in my case).  I've had the Wake-in Bacon, the Parmageddon, and a regular grilled cheese with tomato. I've yet to be disappointed, but I'm never without leftovers! The fries are fresh-cut and tasty - nothing too fancy. But the vinegary, spicy coleslaw makes for the perfect in-between-bites palette cleanser.   Oh, and did someone mention that the beer selection is awesome-sauce? Everyone has? OK, I just wanted to make sure.    (Psssst...you can park in the Rite Aid parking lot across the street for free.)"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly.  We got here at an awkward time when one server was about to get off work and another server was going to be starting.  The first server brought us water and explained the menu, and offered suggestions.  The second server took our order.  Both were very friendly and laid back.  Passing through town as was told by a friend that we needed to stop here for lunch.  My husband and I shared a Monte Cristo sandwich.  The bread is thick!  The sandwich is served cut in half and with each slice stacked on top of each other.  This does cause the middle slices of bread to become soggy (since it was deep fried).  The berry dipping sauce is thinner than I expected, so just be ready to be messy.  Hearty portion of fries is also included.  I would definitely go back if I was in Ohio again.  I would love to try something else... but I wish the sandwiches were smaller so I wouldn't be forced to share/compromise with someone else.  I bet you don't hear that everyday- who wants smaller portions?"}
{"text":"Melt is a Cleveland institution.  Not much can be said about it that hasn't already been said.  There is one sandwich on the menu that is your favorite sandwich.  You just might not have had it yet.  The wait isn't as long as it used to be, but on weekend at lunch or dinner time, it still can get up there.  Try going late on a Tuesday.  You'll get seated right away."}
{"text":"Love this place. If you love cheese you have to come here. Daughter is a vegetarian and they've expanded her vegetarian options so she's very happy. Great staff and priced reasonable."}
{"text":"This used to be a 5 star shop.  I miss what it used to be. Prices went up and quality went down. No more slaw. Fries are now frozen, not fresh cut. Many of the best sandwiches and salads (and dressings) are no longer available. It's as if management hired a consultant who instituted a traditional chain restaurant philosophy of cutting quality and increasing prices once your name is established. It's still tasty food, but nowhere near what it used to be."}
{"text":"This place has been generating a lot of buzz, so wanted to try it out. I did not see any parking lot so we parked on the street.  Inside, the wall decorations remind me of an Applebee's. There are old soda and beer signs and a large number of photos of Cleveland sports teams. There was a 15 min. wait for a table so we sat at the bar. There was one bartender working responsible for serving food and drinks to people at the bar, making drinks for people sitting at tables in the dining room and she was also waiting on tables in the bar area. As a result, getting our order taken took too long.  The menu has a few salads but people come here for the sandwiches. They must have 25 different kinds! Their craft beer selection looked very decent as well. When the food arrived, my 1/2 Hot Italian sandwich was tasty and filling. So the food was good and the service poor. Perhaps someone called in sick."}
{"text":"Om nom nom nom nom!  I had thee Parmageddon sandwich and a gobbler to drink. Wait staff is super kind and the food is to die for!  If you visit Cleveland this place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"I was trapped in a hotel outside of Cleveland so I turned to my trusty Yelp! App for a little help on dinner.  With a little luck and a huge assist from the DoubletTree for shuttling me farther than they were supposed to I was able to have dinner at Melt Bar & Grilled.  Now I admit the thing that drew me to the place besides the high star rating was all the mentions of the location's appearances a few prominent cable TV shows.  I thought even if it was a little cheesy, at least I could have a fun experience.  I am happy to report, there is nothing cheesy or hokey about this place, it is awesome with a side of kick-ass!  Make no mistake this place is a bar, the U-Shaped bar dominates the restaurant with a few tables lining the outside wall.  It has a great neighborhood feel even with all the TV notoriety and it felt like I was the only person who didn't walk to this place from my house.  I was able to a sit at the bar farthest from the door between a couple of friends and a family of five.  I was handed my menu which on the other side was an album cover from the 80s, I loved it.  The staff was very knowledgeable about all of the beers (and there was a laundry list of them) and even had pairing suggestions with the food, not something that I expected at a bar.  Nice touch.  Even though the place was packed the bartender, upon learning it was my first time there, took his time with me and walked me through sandwiches they are famous for, the Man vs. Food challenge item (a monster grilled cheese featuring 13 different cheeses, 3 slices of grilled bread and a pile of hand-cut fries & slaw. Over 5lbs of food) and the beers to go with it.  I settled on the Westside Monte Cristo which is honey ham, smoked turkey, swiss, american, crispy battered & deep fried, with mixed berry preserves.  It was great, I highly recommend it.  To drink I had a Brooklyn blonde ale and the special of the night, a North Peak Archangel (I felt the need to support a home state brewery from Michigan in Ohio).  To Recap:  The Good: The decor, the menus, the staff, the sandwiches, the beer list, the patrons.  I was made to feel like one of the gang.    The Bad: It didn't look like there was much around it, so it needs to be your destination for the night, not a starting point.  But this place can pull it off.  The Band This Restaurant Most Resembles: Marilyn Manson, an Unique Ohio experience!"}
{"text":"I've been a vegetarian for years, and never have I encountered more accurate, inventive, and delicious meat-substitutes as I have at Melt. I've tried upwards of ten different menu items and have enthusiastically enjoyed each one - to my knowledge, my omnivorous peers have been equally positive about their experiences. The portions are huge, the environment is fun, and the cuisine is unique. Literally the only negative comment I can conjure up is that the wait for a table can get really, really long, but, if anything, this attests to the quality of Melt's product and the restaurant's iconic status within the community."}
{"text":"The sandwich I had here blew my face off. I had the Cuban sandwich, which came with a heaping portion of seasoned pulled pork and, maybe ham, I don't totally remember. The meat, cheese and veggies were sandwiched between two french toast thick pieces of bread. I could literally feel my arteries clogging up. I don't usually save half of my meal, but I had no choice, but I was glad I did so I could prolong the magic the next day!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Bring your appetite and your stretchy pants!  This place was an amazing experience.  The food was great! The prices were very reasonable as well. I've paid much more for a much lesser sandwich.  I had the Winter Chicken and it did not disappoint. The flavors were very good and The chicken was tender. The sauce was a little bit sweet and a little bit tangy.  The french fries were very good as well. There were many different beers to choose from as well as craft sodas. This experience was a very good one.  I would Love to visit this place again in the near future."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I feel that whoever thought up their menu was high in the kitchen and never tasted their \"culinary creations\" when sober. A lot of sandwiches just have too much crap on them that ruin what could have been pretty good. There is really only one good sandwich on their regular menu, being the jalapeño popper, and every once in awhile, their specialty sammies are good too. A bit on the pricey side for having mediocre to poor food."}
{"text":"What more can be said about Melt that hasn't already been said. If you are visiting Cleveland, I would consider this place a must stop for good food before you leave. Gourmet grilled cheese at an affordable price.  I have had numerous sandwiches and many of the delicious monthly specialty sandwiches they have. The best, hands down, is the mighty macaroni melt. So, so good and cheesy. Usually available in December and one weekend in July (Christmas in July).  Expect an hour-two wait if you come on a weekend or during typical dining hours. To avoid a wait, come in right when it opens to be seated immediately. If you must wait, the bar is not overpriced and there are many coffee shops near by."}
{"text":"Whoa-hey! Finally got a chance to experience Melt while passing through Cleveland on our way to Cedar Point. Apparently, there's a lot of local hype about this place and as such opinions are split. When you walk in, you see it's a hipster bar of sorts with Halloween and Christmas decorations still up and menus resembling spiral records of sorts, vegan and meat options and a whole lot of craft beer on tap. I would describe the atmosphere as cool and casual.  I'll start with the food. Before I even got here, I was craving a burger. After waiting for about 20-30minutes to be seated (on a Saturday night at 7p--totally reasonable!), I looked over the menu and saw they had hundreds (literally!) of different sandwiches. Everything to please vegans, meat lovers, vegetarians seafood lovers and everything in between. They specialized in different grilled sandwiches, but also had a section for burgers. My eye spotted the \"BBQ Pig Burger,\" which featured an 8 oz ground steak burger, house roasted pulled pork, fried onion straws, chocolate stout bbq sauce and sharp cheddar. House roasted pulled pork AND 8 oz of beef? Best of both worlds!  The waitress assured me that their burgers are fantastic and remarked that it's one of the only places around that she would order her burger rare from. So, I opted for medium rare and about ten minutes later, all our plates come out (pretty much all at once!). My burger was cooked absolutely perfectly uniformly medium rare. It was out of this world delicious! The meat was tender, juicy and so fresh and the pulled pork and chocolate stout bbq sauce added a whole layer of delicious flavor! It wasn't confusing or even hard to eat like I imagined it might be because of the larger variety of ingredients. It, yes...melted in my mouth. The fries were solid and the cole slaw was crunchy and tasty just to my liking. Be warned: portions are huge!  Aside from the food being a delicious heart-attack cornucopia of melted goodness, the service that we received for our party of eight was fantastic: fast, cheerful and our waitress went above and beyond!  Toward the end of the meal, she goes ahead and takes the initiative of asking if we'd like our bill split! No awkward, \"uhhhgh, maybe you can split our bill?!\" because we were too shortsighted and focused on consuming loads of tastiness to ask beforehand. She just does it and makes it super easy! Yes, she tacked on an 18% gratuity for our large party, but that's cool. I'm pretty sure we all tipped her on top of that anyway. Would totally come back here when I'm in the area, but am sorta glad I live far away...otherwise I'd probably die a lot younger from heart attacks and the like! You're lucky, Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Love it! Good...GREAT food, so much of it. If you want to have a diverse choice to veggie-vegan- or carnivore you'll be here. Just be prepped to have a few gallons of water for the salt(which you can't taste at all)"}
{"text":"Amazing food. SOOOOO MUCH OF IT!!!!!!!!  Prices aren't terrible either. Be sure to bring a gallon of water with you the next day. You're gonna be quite thirsty from all the salt.  Cool place, great people, great food."}
{"text":"Home of crazy combination grilled cheese sandwiches and good sides make this a must try spot. We had heard about the grilled sandwiches, but were not prepared for how awesome the salads and soup are.  My meatloaf sandwich was huge with wonderful mashed potatoes squishing out.  The side salad was a perfect balance to its hearty flavors.  Love this place and its quirky, smart and helpful waiters."}
{"text":"It lived up to the hype for me. I had heard horror stories about long waits and the food being overrated, blah, blah, blah...whatever. I thought it was very good and would love to go back again. You should try it at least once to decide for yourself if you like it.  We sat at the bar (there are plenty of seats) and our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I had the Northcoast Shores grilled cheese (handmade crab cakes, wilted garlic spinach, roasted red pepper, herbed cream cheese). It was super yum, and I was so full by the end I couldn't finish it.   Decent number of beers on tap if that is your jam. I'm a big cider fan and loved that they had Wyder's Pear Cider on draft.  We were able to snag street parking out front but I think there is a one hour limit, so be careful of that. There was a lot in the back but it was totally full when we got there. I think there is street parking on some of the side streets in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"Attention all vegetarians! I ordered the Parma Italy and replaced the chicken with their tofu. It was absolutely amazing! I highly suggest this alternative when ordering. I  typically do not care for how tofu is usually prepared and they outdid themselves at the Melt Bar and Grilled."}
{"text":"Waited about 40 mins for a table but the place was absolutely packed .  service was excellent!  wife got the 1\2 godfather , son got mighty Mac and cheese 1\2 , and I got the Korean war pig . and fried pickles with a spicy sauce that was even good on the homemade fries everything was delicious and our drinks never went empty . would recommend anyone in Lakewood or the the other 2 locations in Cleveland if you have the time and are hungry for a massive sandwich melt is definitely the place to go ."}
{"text":"This is to Melt for having 25% off industry nights on Mondays! Hats off to you for remembering us fellow service industry nutcases on our coveted day off. Woo."}
{"text":"Well, with all the hype about this restaurant my husband and I decided to try it.  We love eating out and do so frequently.  This place is way over rated.  We both ordered burgers and Red Robin beats them hands down.  It was crowded and very, very loud.  Not our kind of place at all and certainly not worth the kind of waiting that many people seem to experience.  We were seated within 10 minutes but it was 20 minutes before anyone came to take our beverage order.  No one ever offered refills.  The food was hot and plentiful but not worth the money.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"An absolute must stop anytime you're in Lakewood. Tried their Columbus location and it was also good (but he original is best as always)  I recommend the Parmagetton, or The Godfather."}
{"text":"Went with my parents. Place definitely had style, but the wait was forever and we got there at like 4:30. Crazy. My mom had the montenegro, which was CRAZY good! deep fat fried sandwich with an awesome raspberry sauce. SO GOOD! Definitely enough calories to fuel you for about a week. If you eat the whole thing you'll die. Someone will bring you back with chest compressions and there'll be enough to kill you again. I had the Dude Abides. How could I not? It was pretty good too. And the beer selection was decent. Server was a douche, but he was pleasant enough"}
{"text":"On a Sunday night, wait time was 45 minutes to get a table, then another 45 minutes to get out food once we had ordered...not worth either wait. No apology or explanation from the server, just typical hipster nonchalance."}
{"text":"I was to pleased with my experience at Melt.  Even on a Saturday afternoon, the wait was minimal.  The facilities were very clean and eclectically enjoyable.  Our server Lee was efficient, personable and had great product knowledge,  We waited a very short time for our food. I was pleased there was a build your own option.  I chose that and my dining companion had The Dude Abides. Both were enough for two meals with the geneous servings of fries included.  The Margarita alas tasted like spiked lemonade.  It was good and refreshing.   I can not wait to go back to Melt again! Next time; Chicken Parm!"}
{"text":"I finally feel like a real Cleveland-er. I've lived here nearly 2 years and this was my first visit to melt. I understand why some would say it's not a good date spot, but I wouldn't mind. It's pretty eclectic and they play movies that will remind you if your childhood (if you grew up in the 90s anyway). I got the fried green tomato blt (pork belly, cheese, lettuce, fried green tomatoes) and it was awesome. I had been under the impression all their sandwiches are deep fried, but that's not the case; they ARE , however, all buttery and toasty and greesy goodness. I did get the whole sandwich and ate it all (I was hungry). I had to take the fries home, though, and they were great the next day in the toaster oven.  We could tell it was an extremely busy Saturday night when we went (they were clearly understaffed) so we waited maybe 40 minutes for a table for 5. Our waiter was practically running around the restaurant floor, but he was still kind and attentive to us. I was very impressed with him. Obviously, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here once when I first moved here because it was the place to go in Cleveland. I wasn't entirely impressed by the food or atmosphere. Came back a second time recently and confirmed my thoughts from the first experience. It's a casual place to go for a beer and a sandwich but not something that I would seek out.  I tried the italian and the gyro sandwich. I think it's probably worth it to get the full sandwich for a couple extra dollars instead of the half sandwich. The sandwiches are greasy, huge and bread heavy. If you like that, you'll like this place. I thought it was just a little too much. Get the fried pickles though. They are whole spears which I love."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. I've been a Melt fan for years. I've sat in Lakewood for 2+ hour waits for a seat when it was the only location they had. I'm a Big Popper fan, sub the spicy chicken chowder for the fries and I'm all set.   I usually go to the Independence location. They recently increased the seating close to double.   Tonight I ordered my usual. The place was busy but not packed. We had a 30 minute wait despite the fact there were many empty tables in the new addition. My guess was since it was 730 already they were trying to empty it out for cleaning.   It seemed to me that there was something amiss tonight. The food took much longer to come to us. It was just warm at best. And it just didn't seem up to its usual quality. Again, I just can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's the fact that they added the extra seating but didn't increase the kitchen size. I just don't know.  I like the place. The staff is good. I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"The Grilled Peanut Butter and Banana was very tasty, with the side of mixed berry preserves. Mmmmm. My friend and I had split our sandwich halves and a good thing we did... Mmmmmm. Her Parmaggedon was even better than mine. Very well worth the 30 minute wait!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had!  The fries are awesome, too.  It's a fun atmosphere with quirky decor.  SO very glad I stopped in here!"}
{"text":"Melt is one of the places that makes me want to flee to the Cleve, and in a hurry.  There are two kinds of people who don't like grilled cheese.  Vegans and Satan-worshippers.  And even vegans can be tempted by Melt's menu.  The beer list is a beer drinker's paradise.  The Parmageddon is the stuff dreams are made of.  Hello, Melt?  I'll help you open your Chicago branch."}
{"text":"Melted cheese makes everything better. This place is decadent and the definition of comfort food. Awesome beer selection too."}
{"text":"Melt is lucky that their food is so good and their menu is so creative because WHERE ELSE would you wait for a half-hour to have lunch or risk a 90-minute wait for dinner? Especially when there are so many other good options for dining in the immediate area.   Please, someone please explain to me why this place is so small?  The service is not fast at all and the servers are pretty laid back considering the huge crowd huddling in the lobby.    But... the food is great, and creative.  Don't ever attempt this place when you are on a diet or if you are seeking a \"light meal\".  A majority of the menu is smothered in cheese (duh, it's a grilled cheese spot!), slathered with butter or deep fried.  However, I have had their Kindergartener lunch combo with tomato soup and a side salad and it was a pretty awesome balance.  I could at least go back to work without being in a carb-loaded coma.  They serve the soup in a coffee mug and a side of goldfish crackers, which is a huge plus.  They have great vegetarian and vegan options of most of their sandwiches, including vegan cheese.    Moral of the story, come here if you want a big, rich meal but you better not be in a hurry.  They have a great beer menu so have a beer (or three) while waiting."}
{"text":"Cheyenne was our server!! BOMB SERVICE!! Give this lady a day off!! Knew the menu, knew how to give that 5 Star Service. MONTE CRISTO was on hit! Cleveland Melt thank you"}
{"text":"For the love of all things holy, this place is loud. Like can't hear the person next to you loud. Horrible choice of reflective building materials. Seriously, doubt we will be back for this reason.  The prices are on the ridiculous side when you consider what you are getting in return for your money. Bushwood club ($10 half, $13.50 whole) was bland. Sandwich was tossed together haphazardly. Could not distinguish any flavor other than buttered bread. The rosemary aioli was not assertive, if it was even on the sandwich. Wife did enjoy the Mighty Macaroni ($9.50/$12.50) but c'mon, this is fair food on bread. At a higher price.  Service-wise, server was ok, if not a bit absent. Outdoor seating, while present, was not offered as an option. Service-time was terrible. Memorabilia on the walls was excellent to see."}
{"text":"Yum. Long waits. Great sandwiches. A touch messier than I'd like, (we ate at the bar adjacent to a stack of dirty glasses) but all in, fun. Try the croque monsieur or the Cuban."}
{"text":"I have had my fair share of grilled cheese sandwiches. I have been to a few grilled cheese only restaurants. That being said, this was by FAR my best experience all the way around.   The Food: I had the Mac & Cheese bites for my appetizer. First, there is nothing \"bite\" size about them. They were huge! I could have had those as just my meal and been perfectly full. Oh and did I mention that they were also completely delicious!  For my sandwich I chose the Backyard BBQ with chicken. The sandwich and fries came out and had filed the plate out in all directions! The sandwich itself was at least 3\" tall. The onion rings on the inside made an extra crunch that was delightful.   The Service: While our gentleman server didn't quite understand the time constraints an infant at the table provides, all the interactions were pleasant and prompt. Nothing to complain about. He earned his 20%.   The Atmosphere: Ok, I have been to many a dive joint and while some of the decor was kooky nothing distracted me (could've been I was also to entertained by my small child as well).   Overall: an absolute MUST if you are in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want to leave full. Huge sandwiches and pretty good beer selection. Not to mention the service was great. We got there pretty late on a weekday and didn't feel rushed to eat. We were the last guests to come in and we were still given good service. Sampled a few beers suggested by our server. I ordered the Purple Parma. Delish. Couldn't finish half the sandwich. Like I said they are huge. Next time I'm in Cleveland I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Independence on the dime of our Regional Sales Director... Everyone got a sammy but I went rogue and got a VERY delish salad with all sorts of stuff in it.... GINORMOUS!!!!!  I ate it all cause thats how I roll!!! There were plenty of to go boxes cause the portions are big but TASTY! Everyone had the same experience.... EXCELLENT!!!! One ding cause it seemed to take forever...(Lets just wisper that one other star!!!)"}
{"text":"Why four? Place is too small. Business is growing but they don't extend and it causes long waiting lines. Otherwise food is delicious. I went only because it was on tv hahaha. Lots of cheese. Lots of sauce. Lots of carbs :)"}
{"text":"Get ready to wait an hour and a half for a table (maybe more), but once you sit, the food is amazing.  I tend to enjoy taking the Kindergarden to new levels, adding sun dried tomato pesto with smoked gouda...but every sandwich i've had has been great.   Amazing brunch as well!"}
{"text":"So I get it, who doesn't love cheese?!  But I think this place is a little hyped up because of the concept. Their sandwiches are good, don't get me wrong. But is it the best sandwich I've tried-no.   Also, since the name is Melt, and they specialize in grilled cheese sandwiches I kinda expected more cheese options. Yeah, I said it. I loveeee cheese and maybe I was expecting some unique cheese toppings and left feeling like hey I could make this at home.   The restaurant itself is kinda like a pub and a restaurant had a baby. Can't describe it but once you're inside you'll know what I mean.   Would I come back, probably. The food isn't bad or anything just overall okay.   Beware! The sandwiches are HUGE so go in with a full appetite :)"}
{"text":"We had a couple hours before my son's hockey game, so we decided to try this place out. I've had Melt carry out once before, but never dined in. The waiting area was spacious, which was a good think considering our 45 minute wait time. Once we were seated, the waitress was friendly and responsive. We started with a chips and spinach/cheese dip appetizer. It was delicious, but there was not enough dip to cover the 30 or so chips that came with it. However, the meals made up for that. The sandwiches were loaded; and the plates had lots of tasty homemade fries and their signature coleslaw (which is very dry, but chunky - and I liked it). I went with the Mushroom Melt which was an awesome sandwich. So, the only negative here was that - even after we were seated - it still took  us another 45 minutes to get our food. So, my son and I literally had to eat half our food in about 10 minutes and then hit the road with the leftovers. Once she new we were in a hurry, the waitress was accommodating, getting our bill to us in parallel with our food, and cashing out quickly. I'd love to go back, but since I'm not the most patient person, it would have to be during some off hours of the day."}
{"text":"The best comfort food! I had the Korean War Pig sandwich and even my burps were delicious later on!"}
{"text":"Food was great, although I don't know if it warrants a 1 1/2 hour wait.  We lucked out and found a table in the bar area, which are first come first serve.  Basically a glorified grilled cheese with whatever you can think of in the sandwich.  Like most meals today, it could have been half the size and still filled me up, so split the order with someone else if you can.  I would eat there about once a year because it will take that long to burn off the calorie count.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This place is very trendy and the staff is very friendly. Like the concept of unique grilled cheeses. They have a ton of options. Some combinations are more difficult to visualize then others.I had to decided between the meatloaf and chicken and waffle sandwiches. I opted to go with the chicken and waffle grilled cheese and it did not disappoint.  The sandwich was huge and came with a side of syrup. The fries were pretty good too.  I could not finish all of it, which was cool since I just had lunch for the next day. They also have a full bar, so you can get your drink on too. There is only street parking so you will have to feed a meter before you feed yourself. Oh well, but it is worth. I highly recommend this place and look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"How to prepare for melt-  1. Wear stretchy pants 2. Come hungry  3. Prepare for a serious case of \"the itis\" aka \"food coma\"  They give you A TON of really good greasy food.  The portion sizes are huge and you'll def be stuffed after. Melt puts and awesome twist on an American classic and it's worth every single greasy, cheesy, crispy calorie.  I've tried the backyard bbq, summer chicken, and chili.    If you're going with friends I recommend that everyone get a whole sandwich and swap half of it for a half of someone else's sandwich! I ended up torn between two different sandwiches and my friend had the same struggle so this worked out perfectly for us!  Everything was very good and it's somewhere I would definitely try again."}
{"text":"I use to think no one made better grilled cheese than my mom... then I went to Melt! WOW! They know how to make a grilled cheese!   I decided to venture away from \"The Kindergarten\" and be spontaneous and order a grilled peanut butter and banana melt! Possibly the greatest food decision I've ever made in my life! I am proud to say I ate the ENTIRE thing and still have dreams about this sandwich! I need to make another trip up to Cleveland soon just so I can go back to Melt!   The service was great- we had about a half hour wait for a table on a Saturday afternoon- but it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the Cleveland area. This location is true to their brand, and the service and food is excellent. Have never had a bad experience dining here"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Be warned they are huge. They're a little expensive but you get a lot of food!  They have a nice selection of beer to accompany your sandwich. Expect to spend about $20 if you get a beer with your food. The atmosphere is the usual upbeat indy lakewood vibe. They do get busy around lunch and dinner and they don't take reservations so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I just really love this place. The service is always good, and the food is always up to par. The leftovers keep and re-heat really well, too, especially if you re-heat in the oven. (I know I can't ever finish my whole plate when I come here.) I recently moved and definitely miss coming here monthly."}
{"text":"LOVE MELT. This is my second most frequented location. I just wanted to post and say the last few times I've been to this location the host has been super rude. But per usual, food is great and waiter is always wonderful."}
{"text":"Everything was spot on! So Freaking Good! Everyone here seems to say it takes awhile. We are in Cleveland for the day to go to a baseball game. My husband, baby, and I got to the cleveand heights location right at 11am when they opened. no wait. some tables but not overly crowded on this Sunday morning. we were seated, served, ate and paid  all within 35 minutes. I call that pretty speedy.  I like the off the wall ambience ...blue ceilings... menus on the back of old record album covers.  We opted for a burger with herbed cream cheese and jalapeños. We split it after hearing about it's mass size. Definitely glad we shared it. The burger was cook perfectly, the bread perfect. The herb cream cheese sooooooo melt in your mouth and married with the uncooked jalapeños....omg...I seriously can't even explain. We also loved the hand cut fries. Perfect.   I seriously wouldn't have changed one single thing about our visit. Amazing. The locals really must frequent the doctors with all the major cheese intake around these parts. only sad we can't get back to this place anytime relatively soon.   I highly suggest you stop here if passing through or if you happen to be one of the few locals who have never been. yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland, first time at Melt! I knew I was in for some serious eats, and was not disappointed. My sin of choice was the Shrimp Po' Boy (pan fried shrimp, cornbread hush puppies, tomato-chipotle jam, white BBQ sauce, arugula, and pepper jack). Loved it! But couldn't finish it. The fries were great, too! Ultimate \"cheat\" meal.. and then some! Whew."}
{"text":"(I have not been to the original Lakewood location.)  Arrived at about 10pm on a Wednesday night.  The place was packed, but we were seated immediately at the only available table.  Our server told us the wait would be an hour for sandwiches, so we ordered beers and the spinach and artichoke dip (on our server's recommendation) while we waited.  The spinach and artichoke dip was tasty, and we actually filled up pretty quickly on that.  Our sandwiches arrived at about 10:45pm.  I'd ordered the \"Purple Parma,\" which is basically an eggplant parm sandwich.  My partner ordered the \"Lake Erie Monster,\" which was basically fish and chips on a sandwich.  Both sandwiches were pretty much exactly as we wanted and expected.  The food wasn't amazing, but it was a good experience.  We're excited about this option on the East Side, especially that it's open at 10pm after a long, interstate trip.  We've had trouble finding food at this hour in this neighborhood.  Also, they have a great beer selection, and I really liked the plastic Halloween and Christmas decor.  Edited to add:  Have been a few more times.  Sat at the bar once, when tables were full, and I highly recommend it.  Not worth waiting, especially if you don't have to.  Also, not the place to go if you're really really hungry RIGHT NOW.  I've taken it down from 4 to 3 stars because... well, I just can't go there all the time.  Had to go 3 times in 1 month because of guests and, wow, that was way too much Melt."}
{"text":"If you want to wait 2 hours for a grilled cheese that is awkward to fit in your mouth, boring fries and a bar full of douchebags....Melt is the place for you.  I wanted to like this place so bad and I've gone there many times....... but my best meals from there have been take out.  I've received rude service in the restaurant a couple of times....almost like I wasn't 'cool' enough to be eating at a grilled cheese restaurant.  Being treated like that makes everything taste bad."}
{"text":"Alright, here is the down-low, I've been going to Melt since 2010 when they opened their Cleveland Heights location and have since been to the Lakewood, Mentor, and Independence locations numerous times. At the beginning I ate there way too often and have had most of their menu (and they have experimented with many different menus and monthly specials over the years), but then I kind of got burnt out. Melt took away the coleslaw, the prices seemed to get higher and higher, food quality seemed to lessen as they expanded, and there was the unfortunate experience with that clambake melt in 2014. (This sandwich was so bad I left Lakewood Melt a 1 start review along with completing their receipt survey. Their director of operations put aside a $20 gift card for me towards a future purchase and it took me over a year to use it).  After that terrible experience I have tried Melt 3 times since (New Bomb Turkey, Winner Chicken Dinner, Voodoo Chicken) and I feel okay enough now to give them a higher rating. The food has been good and portion sizes have been big enough to split into two meals for me. Doing so also wards off feeling too much disgust and regret. I mean, sometimes I spend the $3 to upgrade to a side salad instead of fries, other times I really love the unsalted fries dipped in that rosemary garlic aioli stuff mmm.   Staff has been friendly and helpful when I don't have my Big Cheese Club card on me but still want to add my purchase towards my points.   Incredibly loud inside. Went here for lunch to celebrate a co-worker's birthday and it was hard to hear what the people at my table were saying.   Last remark: it's unfortunate Melt has entered into money hungry chain status with ten locations in NEO and Columbus now. Maybe I am being a salty brat, but I just don't view them as a cool unique Cleveland restaurant anymore, they're turning into a hipster Mr. Hero (better tasting than Mr. Hero, but still)."}
{"text":"Love Melt, I am even a member of the Big Cheese Club, however I sometimes feel like there is not enough cheese on these grilled cheese sandwiches. Also the flavors sometimes disappear and i taste nothing but a big starchy mound of food.  And they have forgotten my sides before, but always make up with a small gift card. In the end some sandwiches are a hit or miss, anyways they still keep me coming back.   Always great service though. I have been to all the locations except Lakewood."}
{"text":"I started going to Melt when they opened their second location in 2010. At first I was like \"heck yeah, give me all you've got!\" but after awhile the shiny, greasy, appeal of their huge grilled cheese sandwiches started to wear off.  My trips became less and less frequent because the quality of the sandwiches started to diminish, they took away the coleslaw, and raised prices. This place is popular because it's a gimmick; they do like to change things up and keep that whole \"we're a cool unique hipster place\" vibe, but if you look past all of that and really pay attention to the food, mostly likely you'll be disappointed.   Case in point, the new Clam Bake Melt I got last night from the Lakewood location. Keep in mind I called in the order as I was driving to the restaurant so the picture I took is of a fresh sandwich. The menu says it comes with gravy and a cheese spread, but as you can see from the picture, any cheese \"sauce\" that was on it hardened up and I can barely tell there is any \"gravy\" on there. Did I really just pay $14.50 for a hard piece of bread with dried up meat on it? Dull, hard, plain, goop -  those are the words I would use to describe this debacle. I was expecting flavor, a huge tasty sandwich covered in sauce and gravy, but instead I got sadness.  Sorry Melt fans, I guess I'm just a food snob who won't settle for mediocre, but I have taste buds, so you can't really blame me."}
{"text":"Just wouldn't go back. Artery-clogging gross! I ordered the turkey club. The bread tastes like super thick French toast. There is no flavor to their Rosemary mayo. The fries are bland and greasy. My family of 5 was not impressed. Not one of us said, \"Wow! That was good!\" There are more downsides to going here than positive sides. In fact, we left with aching bellies and indigestion from all the grease AND everyone gained weight from the salt!! If this happens because of an amazing meal, it is one thing. But, when it happens from a bad one, it feels SO UNFAIR."}
{"text":"I have been to Melt many times and have never had bad food or a bad experience.  Sometimes they are so busy that I've had to wait, especially around the lunch hour so plan ahead.  The grilled cheese sandwiches are huge and can easily feed two people.  My favorites are the Chorizo and Potato, and the Big Popper (jalapeno, cream cheese, deep fried) -- amazing! The fries and salads are equally delicious. Melt is not healthy, diet food but absolutely worth the splurge once in a while."}
{"text":"After living in Cleveland for awhile and having ventured to the \"original\" Melt Bar and Grilled time and time again, I just wanted to say it is a definite must if you are in the Cleveland area.  That being said, it is good, but not the amazing place that some people think it is.  Every time I go back to the area with someone who has never been there, I do go back, but it is not for their amazing cuisine.  It is just one of those different places worth checking out.    I mean, I do love grilled cheese and all, but I have never been one of those people who likes crazy concoctions and lots of different toppings.  I do give them an A++++ for their beer selection (not many places have Southern Tier Creme Brulee on tap and they had on a few visits).  Portions are huge, the cole slaw is one that I actually dig (I cannot say this about many cole slaws), and the service was always good without issue.  Sometimes the wait can be out of control since this location is so small."}
{"text":"Melt perfectly exemplifies when something falls short of expectations that begin and only continue to rise as the wait gets longer.   For one thing, Clevelanders, it is a grilled cheese sandwich. Not a ride at an amusement park. Not Missoni at Target. I would consider myself a being of reasonable patience, but sitting in Melt for 3 hours waiting on said grilled cheese sandwich greatly tests the limits of my threshold for hunger. Probably in the 4th hour, a little after 9 pm, the sandwich appears. It is thick and looks unhealthy. I ate it.  As you can see, it was not very memorable. Come to me, and in under 600 seconds I will make you a grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Sandwich was really good. Ordered to go. Got summer chicken. Rest off an got chicken waffle, no flavor, cheese bread kids menu really good.   Woman who helped us had bad attitude for some reason. She said that for kids meal to go you don't get the included drink but the family with us did so I had to ask for a drink again. Besides how bad she was I thought food was good. It's a little overpriced  though. Half sandwich $10 $, 14 for whole. Although size is big a little high just for sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had heard about it from friends and watched part of a TV show about it. I had the Purple Parma which is a grilled cheese filled with layers of Eggplant Parmesan. It was super tasty. The eggplant was perfectly cooked. I really appreciated the crustiness of the bread, and the garlicky flavor. My only complaint is I thought the breading on the eggplant was a bit too much. I was impressed at how little I could get through. I usually can pack down quite a bit but was quickly defeated by half of the sandwich.   For sides and whatnot, I substituted my fries with a salad and got the thai chili lime dressing. It packs a bit of a kick, so be aware. They also have a great beer list."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, it took me a while to get on the \"MELT-Train.\" I initially found in overly kitschy, the portion sizes too overwhelming and some of the sandwiches rather pedestrian.  But, I kept coming back--trying new sandwiches, exploring their apps and salads--and began to appreciate this place more and more.  Their sandwiches are massive and it's easy to \"stay safe\" here, like with the Monte Cristo or the Wake & Bacon, which are both good.  There are a number of sandwiches, however that merit a try.  The Korean War Pig is so good. It's adventurous with kimchi slaw and pear onion relish, but mixes in familiar flavors like pulled pork and muenster cheese.  The Mushroom Melt is an incredibly \"meaty\" option with complex flavors from the very sweet port onions and the spicy, fresh arugula.  I'm not a fan of the sweet slaw and was happy when they moved away from automatically including it with your meal.  I know people like it, but I prefer my slaw to be more vinegary.  The fries are decent, treading that line of crispy and soft and always well seasoned.  I prefer them in the Hangover Fries! Poutain with pork belly and a fried egg? What more can you ask for? Also, their Fried Green Tomato appetizer is delicious.  Crispy, slightly spicy with a little freshness.  I also like that this place can be enjoyed by those erg dietary restriction and limitations, offering many vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options.  This is a Cleveland institution and rightly so, so I highly encourage you stop in and try something ADVENTUROUS. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We're on vacation and travelling to see our sons for the holidays. It was time to eat and we're not trying to eat fast food while enjoying vacation, so we looked for a place to enjoy good Cleveland food. We settled on the Melt after reading some rave reviews here on Yelp. We arrived, were seated immediately and the service throughout our visit was fantastic!. We ordered the pierogis to start--I had been craving them and they were great. As for the sandwiches, I ordered the Big Popper and my husband ordered the Garlic Mushroom Melt. Both of the sandwiches received high marks in many reviews, so we felt confident. My husband enjoyed the sandwich, but felt it was more of a \"mushroom sandwich\" rather than a fab grilled cheese with yummy mushrooms on it--too many mushrooms, not enough cheese. As for the Big Pooper...It was ok. For me, it was too much bread not enough everything else, but the flavor combination was delicious. Other than those observations, we really enjoyed our experience. The beer was awesome and the atmosphere will bring us back again. Check this place out, you won't be sad!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Cleveland Heights location for years, so it was nice to come to the original location a couple weeks ago.  The food was tasty and the service was efficient.  Need to get back here more often, although my arteries might disagree..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and lost of neat beers. And oh yea the foods good too. Make sure you read the menu closely as the beer descriptions are a bit confusing but the bartender was good at recommending."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I have been to both locations and like both equally.  I personally have have the Monte Cristo, which is freaking amazing!  I have also had the Big Popper, the Reuben, the Parmagedeon and you can't go wrong with any of those.  Keep saying I am going to try something new, but it is hard to deviate from the deliciousness of the ones I have had.   Well worth the wait.  Nice vibe inside."}
{"text":"The first and greatest Melt ever. Back in the day I remember waiting hours to get a seat, slowly getting drunk on high test brews.  Good times. Getting a seat at the bar was awesome.  Especially if Neil was tending!   This place is awesome. It's a cool punk feel with murals, record art posters, and hip not fake staff. Food and drinks awesome. Parmageddon, bigpopper, and dude (vegetarian) are my Favs. The buffalo wet chicken (veg) version was a fav, yet the hot sauce that it used to come with isnt around snymore. Boo. I recommend subbing vegetables for the fries. Yes there is an upcharge. But they are soooo good. Especially if the veg is brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, and Logan was the best server ever We had a large group so we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table but we were able to get some drinks at the bar while we waited which was nice and made the time pass by quickly"}
{"text":"when it comes to a grilled cheese, there's usually not much to it, right? well if we're talking about melt then that's so wrong. there is more to a grilled cheese than some buttered bread and cheese slices-this place has reinvented the grilled cheese and they've done so in a way that leaves me pretty much in awe. the chorizo filled grilled cheese is to die for and i won't even get started on the sweet potato fries. the wait is a bit excessive, but once you sink your teeth into one of melts amazing sandwiches you'll totally understand why a wait like that is more than justified."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! You will leave here stuffed. Came through while staying local for a football game. Kind of a long wait on a Saturday night and a bit loud, but once you start eating, you don't really notice. So many varieties of sandwiches to pick from. Fries are now on my top five!"}
{"text":"Update 07/02/09: Having returned to Melt several times since my initial review, I continue to support my veritably fawning statements regarding the radness of the place.  They also carry Rochefort 8 AND 10, which makes me a happy fellow.  Again, a ridiculously good beer selection, great food (huge sandwiches), and a fun atmosphere.  It gets crammed and busy at times, but if you expect that and take it in stride, you'll have a good time.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from my wife's mechanic, who told her the sandwiches were awesome but so huge that you couldn't eat here regularly. He pretty much described it perfectly!  Melt offers grilled cheese sandwiches with virtually everything under the sun thrown in between the hearty slices of bread. I had BBQ brisket & onion rings while my wife had meatballs and fried mozzarella wedges. Both sandwiches were tasty and really big. I barely managed to finish mine (which, looking around, seemed to be one of the smaller sandwiches they offer) while my wife took half of hers home for later. My daughter got a chicken strip platter from the kids' menu and it almost had as much food as the grown-ups' dishes, and was very yummy too (Daddy stole a taste just to be sure).  The wait staff was friendly and attentive, though the bartenders looked a little bored. It seems the lunchtime crowd goes there more for the food than for the variety of beers they offer. Can't say I blame them! We'll definitely be going back to try more sandwich combos."}
{"text":"Tried this place while in town. I was quite impressed. I got the Godfather and it was amazing. The service was a bit slow and we were even sitting at the bar. There was lots of stuff to look at around the resturant. It was super busy for a Sunday night. I would go here again for sure."}
{"text":"I love cheese so I had to go to Melt when I was in Cleveland.   You may want to fast before coming here because I'm not sure it's possible to eat a complete sandwich and a side of fries.  They have all different fun options from Buffalo Chicken to a Pierogi Grilled Cheese.   I opted to create my own grilled cheese masterpiece of American, Blue Cheese, Havarti, Avocado and Tomato.   Sounds so simple but it was just simply delicious.  The fresh cut fries were tasty too.  My only gripe was that the service was pretty slow on a Thursday evening.   On the plus side, we had ZERO wait to get seated."}
{"text":"Awesome find. I had a half club with the kettle chips which were delicious. The chips had a perfect crunch and the sandwich was big even for a half portion. I liked the cheesy-ness and the meat was plentiful.   I also got a side salad with feta and peanut sesame. Everything was so fresh and good. I liked the croutons and the fact that this had egg on the salad.   Lastly I tried a cup of the tomato soup and it was also very good. I liked the savory flavors that matched well eating with the sandwich."}
{"text":"Traveled here while visiting the area. Great concept and executed flawlessly. Wonderful service from the staff."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location. We arrived at 8:00PM on a Tuesday evening. The hostess said it would be an hour wait for a table of two. We managed to grab bar seats immediately.  While the bartender who served us was very friendly, we did not receive our order for over 50 minutes from ordering. My husband ordered a sandwich (the PB one) and I ordered a small side salad with the veggie of the day. My veggie special was barely warm.  I like the food, but until both locations improve their dine-in experience, I'll be sticking with to-go orders."}
{"text":"Omg this place was good! So many vegan options. The tofu wings were super! Also yummy kraut! Yay."}
{"text":"Surprised to find out my sandwich was completely calorie-free.  No, it wasn't. It really REALLY wasn't.  For those Bostonians reading these finely crafted words, consider the interior (and by this, I mean look, personality and demeanor) to be a punkier Friendly Toast. For those Clevelanders absorbing my sage advice, head to The Friendly Toast in your next trip to Boston. It'll remind you of a more retro Melt.  Meteorology aside, you go for the grilled cheese, albeit a slight misnomer as the sandwiches can easily be dominated by non-cheesey foodstuffs, much to your arterial delight. Not so fast, aorta - the other junk is a cholesterol den of animal flesh, fried foods and (there's hope!) vegetarian/vegan alternatives. Live to see another day?  My two-week red meat fast steered me away from the tempting Monte Cristo and the fried pickled-topped Cuban Melt. Tossing betwixt the the pierogi-loaded Parmageddon or the \"hey, let's deep fry a sandwich\" Big Popper, I asked the staff for halp. Because the latter is stuffed with fresh jalapeños, \"it's really spicy,\" noted Lil' Flo -our server who smiled wider than the Black Hole Sun video. Big Popper it is.  The promised peppers oozed from a crispy behemoth in a river of molten cheddar and herbed cream cheese, cooled only with time and the sweet berry preserves for dunking. One bite and I was hooked. Two bites and I was full. Three bites and things began to get uncomfortable. Four bites, and... well, buy the video. $10.50 may seem lofty for sandwich & fries kinda lunch, but trust me, the staff automatically brings boxes with the check - you'll get two meals outta deez gaiz.  Not to skip the eye candy that is the sango's guts, but the 'wich wouldn't be at the top of the stack without the assist from some serious bread. Soft and yeasty, while hearty enough to hold cheese at solar temps, it's the icing on the five-star cake. Oh wait, that's really icing? Eh, I'm in.  Free refills on fountain soda, small batch bottles for the snootier fizz palate, robust beer selection and a killer soundtrack (Ice Ice Baby? You bet!) mean you'll feel good all over! Except for that pesky distended stomach."}
{"text":"On my my road trip back from Philly, Pa to Detroit a stop at Melt's in Cleveland was a must.  I had seen this restaurant on Food Network several times and couldn't pass up the opportunity to check out some of these grilled cheese sandwiches gone crazy.  I love how these use old record albums for menus and by the time your done scanning the room with all the nick knacks hanging on the wall your food has arrived.  Crisp buttery flavored  bread crammed with your choice of delicatessens & gooey cheese.  How could it get any better? You could serve them with carnival like fries  & a unique refreshing coleslaw.  We tried 5 different sandwiches and they were all delicious, even the one stuffed with lasagna.  When they say Cleveland Rocks, I'm pretty sure their referring to Melt!!! This place takes me back to time when life was simple, a time when you didn't have to worry about who was paying the bill.  If you listen carefully you can hear the baseball card making noise on the spoke of my bike tire. I'm not sure how far people come from to try these sandwiches but it was so worth the drive. Rock on Guys!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in Ohio and my friend and I flew in for a friends wedding. We got in late and still needed something for dinner. Not being from Ohio and driving from the airport, everything looked closed (it was 10:15pm) but hoped once we get to the hotel, they could make a recommendation!   My friend looked at the list and saw the Melt was nearby and said we have to check it out. It was great because they were open until 1am!! As soon as we entered we were greeted and seated! It was nice to see this place in full swing and also be able to sit as soon as we walked in!   The lady handed us the menu and pointed out that they had vegetarian and vegetarian available options. Being a vegetarian, I truly appreciated her pointing them out! It's rare where you can find a place that does that!   After reviewing the menu and being torn between a few, I ended up ordering the basic grilled cheese which is called the \"Kindergarten\" and added avocado and tomato. Let's just say, I'm glad I ordered it because it was DELISH!!!   I wish there was a Melt in Massachusetts!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of grilled cheese sandwiches, so we made sure we sought this place out on our last visit to Cleveland. Thank goodness for our in-car GPS as we found this place without too much trouble. On-street parking or parking in a metered lot behind this small strip of businesses. The cutesy atmosphere with lighted pumpkins, Santas and all manner of strange lawn ornament-type decorations made it feel a little like visiting a beloved basement rec room. You can get grilled cheese here, but the hook seems to be that they have a large variety of sandwiches that -include- melted cheese as a component. My dining companion had a hot Italian sandwich and I had the aptly named Parmageddon (a grilled-cheese-and-pierogi combo). Our sandwiches came with a large portion of cole slaw and a HUGE portion of fries. Be prepared for to take home leftovers...or to possibly consider splitting a meal. I particularly liked my rough-cut fries and the plump pierogi...a Cleveland classic. The pierogi alone on my sandwich was as big as my face, so the sandwich was massive...sadly, we couldn't finish our meals in one sitting...our hotel didn't have a mini fridge...and we didn't have a cooler...so half of our meals ended up going to waste :( We stopped in around 5 p.m. on a weeknight, which worked out fine for us...no wait."}
{"text":"Does this place NEED another review?  Well, I'M GONNA cuz it was THAT GOOD.  If you wanna come here, try lunch time, ok?  We walked in at 12:45pm on a Friday and did not wait.  AT ALL. SCORE!  Had a super patient waiter who gave us awesome tips and was super helpful. (Joe I think?) Ordered full sammiches so we'd have leftovers for dinner. (Yeah, baby!) I got the Korean War Pig, and sister ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT.  Mine was...just pretty much amazing.  Those perfect bites where i got a little kimchi, some pulled pork, muenster, AND the pear cilantro slaw? WOW.  Awesomely spicy (but not too much.) Ordered chipotle ketchup for fries and loved the smokiness. Sister's sammy was pretty freaking good too. She LOVED the remoulade and said it gave the sandwich the perfect \"zing\". We each ordered a ginger beer, which was a lovely compliment to our lunch. The dude at the host stand even gave me a sticker! Totally putting it on my car. :) WILL BE BACK with the hubby so he can experience the awesomeness!  Quality? CHECK. Service? CHECK.  Deliciousness? CHECK!  Do yourself a favor and GO HERE."}
{"text":"Giant greasy sandwich for a great price, what's not to love! Decent beer selection too."}
{"text":"Maybe my taste or my expectations have changed but I thought this place was okay.  I get the fact of the hipster décor and approach to almost anything that involves food nowadays, but old Christmas decorations lining the walls it just ridiculous.    I digress,  the food, I ordered the backyard bbq with brisket, which was just good, certainly not great and the brisket lacked the flavor. Really my whole dish lacked flavor, even with the onion rings, cheese and bbq sauce between two loaves of bread.  My god, cut it thinner so one can enjoy a bit. However, I did enjoy the fries.   The staff was enjoyable and attentive and the prices are good, even for a grilled cheese.    Every time I go to a spot that Guy has endorsed, I have left disappointed and this time was no different."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the Lake Erie monster here and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Went Sunday night about 7, the place was basically empty, but figured just because it was an off time. The environment was horribly cold, both my husband and guest were freezing so it wasn't just me. My fries came out cold and overly salty. Gross but I ate them because I was starving and I dislike sending food back. My sandwich was also cold and extremely disappointing. I had the Cleveland Cheesesteak. My husband had the Dude Abides and my guest from Dallas had the Parma Italy. All of our fries were on the cold side, but I could at least see steam coming from my friend's sandwich and I think she is too nice and positive to point out anything bad about the meal. Sort of embarrassing when you talk up a place and it ends up falling flat."}
{"text":"Melt is always a treat.  Great atmosphere with the eclectic decorations; in Cleveland Heights I love the video game decor as part of the bar and the old DQ signs, plus of course the Santas, Draculas and other lightups near the ceiling.   Nice that with the multiple locations it is much easier to actually get in and get served.    The service is always excellent, it really helps when you have people who enjoy where they are working and like to help you out.  I have always found the Melt crew to be incredibly upbeat and helpful; and of course they usually have some really nice ink.  The menu has kept many of the old favorites along with some newer items; one recent change is that you can get half sandwiches, which considering the size of most of the sandwiches which is a welcome option.  This go round I had the Sanchez, which is the sandwich of the month for May.  A huge conglomerate of Mexican items including a cheese enchilada and a cheese tamale, along with chips and sides of salsa and flavored sour cream.  Overall the sandwich was good, but the tamale kind of overwhelmed the other ingredients.  Of course the pile of fresh made fries was a great compliment.  Ended up taking half the sandwhich home for the next day and it was tasty.  Melt has some great sandwiches, outstanding soups and overall wonderful food."}
{"text":"How do they expect I, a mere mortal, to eat this entire sandwich? I ordered \"The Dude Abides\", a miraculous grilled cheese sandwich, that according to legend stands at least 3 ft tall, filled with homemade meatballs, fried mozz wedges, marinara sauce, and provolone. If I was a better man I would have eaten the second half too, but I came up short and embarrassed my family name.  Someday I will return. And next time I'll be ready."}
{"text":"The Parmageddon may be the most perfect sandwich ever. Who ever would have thought that sauerkraut and pierogi on a sandwich would taste so incredible. The beer list is just phenomenal. Every sandwich I've ever had here is amazing. It just sucks waiting for a table for 2 hours on a weekend night."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated. I went here a couple of weeks ago and was really not impressed. I figured any place that would make you wait 2.5 hours to get a table and then an additional 45 minutes for food, it might actually be impressive. It was really anything but."}
{"text":"Overrated, grilled cheese with medicore tasting meat. What is they hype about? They have decent choices if you love grilled cheese, but I really don't see what they fuss is about. You pay a decent amount for texas toast, extra cheese, and to be in a hipster type place. Bar food at best, Man Vs Food helped pump this place up more than what it is. Sorry, I can't get on board with this one, like so many others have. Trust me, try this one at home yourself, you can do the same if not better. They just have the ingredients, I guess that is half the battle."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Lakewood spots. A true original. Need to get there at least once a month to get the newest special!"}
{"text":"Always great service and this time was no different, we waited 5 minutes to be seated and the place was just about perfect as usual. I love their buffalo chicken soup and the new asian salad was wonderful really a great fresh alternitive."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for any food item that incorporates gooey, melty cheese (mac n' cheese, grilled cheese, fried cheese, you name it).  Melt takes your regular, already delicious, grilled cheese sammies and turns them into a spectacular eating experience.  After hearing friends talk about this place for months I finally made a trip to Cleveland and got to check it out... it has probably been two years since I went and I am STILL thinking about my food and plotting my next return.  It's that good.  Or I am just a fat kid on the inside who dreams about gut-busting food on the regular.  Probably both.  My group consisted of 9 people and we showed up to Melt at about noon on a Saturday.  We, luckily, anticipated the FOUR HOUR wait and a member of our group had tracked down a bar within walking distance to pass the time.  This situation may have been somewhat remedied since my last visit as new locations have opened around Cleveland, but even if it has not the wait is probably worth it.  One friend and I decided the best approach was to each order a different sammy and split, to get the most out of our day-o-Melt.  She ordered the Northcoast Shores (handmade crab cakes, wilted garlic spinach, roasted red pepper, herbed cream cheese) and I ordered the Westside Monte Cristo (honey ham, smoked turkey, swiss, american, crispy battered & deep fried, with mixed berry preserves).  As I type this, literally years later, my mouth still waters thinking about these sammies.  The perfectly toasty bread (or deep fried, why not?), the gooey cheese, the delicious ingredients.  Yes, maybe one plate is enough to feed a small country.  Yes, this one day took so much out of me I vowed that albeit delicious I could probably only attend Melt to eat once a year (or maybe every six months... or few weeks).  But if those are the worst criticisms you can come up with for a sammich then I'm still sold on it.    While I have not been back to Melt yet (sorry, Cleveland, you leave much else to be desired) I am counting down the days until I am reunited with a giant plate of sammich deliciousness."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  From the food to the decor, it is a must visit if you are in town.  I love that they are not a large franchise, but I kind of wish they were so I could have one here in St. Louis!  Great Food and Great Service!  They really deserve all five stars!"}
{"text":"I LOVE that Melt has a location close to my hotel for when I travel to Cleveland. I love that the inside of it is reminiscent of decor in my former apartments. I love that the plates of food that leave the kitchen are piled a foot high. I love that on the night we went, the wait was 40 minutes and we totally cheated and slipped into a bar table and ate immediately. I love the service - the staff was helpful and great with recommendations. I love too, that it didn't break my wallet to get such a fine meal!"}
{"text":"cI've been planning my business trip to Cleveland for weeks and the one thing everyone told me was that I had to eat at Melt!  I went with my two colleagues. We absolutely loved the environment. Funky holiday decorations, local sports team paraphernalia, very friendly staff. We ordered the fried Mac and cheese as an appetizer. They weren't what I was expecting. They're huge triangle pieces of fried Mac and cheese on a bed of cheese sauce. Very good and very filling but nothing special (same consistency as easy Mac except a little more rich).  I ordered the special which includes a cup of soup, salad, and half a sandwich. It was a lot of food -- but I'm not complaining! The salad was large and delicious. Tomato soup was a little over-salted, but a good smooth yet chunky consistency with cheese and scallions on top. The sandwich did not fail. I got pork belly, gouda, roasted garlic aioli on it. Pork belly was crispy and salty, gouda was delicious and garlic aioli, although a bit thick, was very flavorful.   I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ever since moving away from Cleveland, I found myself constantly bragging about this delicious to people who had never heard. Recently visited family in Ohio but was sure to stop by and order my favorite - Monte Cristo.   I am 99.9% sure it is impossible to order a bad sandwich. Every single menu item I have tried has been fantastic, and the left overs make a great late night snack.   I will always come back for some Melt!"}
{"text":"Menu has reasonable prices and gluten free options. Service could have been better- took a while to get our food."}
{"text":"Luv the grilled cheese - hate the wait!  Nearly every time we've been here the wait to get a table is 45 min plus and once seated the wait for food is almost as long.  Bummer, because I really do like Half combo that includes a  1/2 sandwich, soup and salad.  They won't allow a teenager to be seated at the bar even with a parent which would have sped up the wait.   Wait here in. Cleveland hts is always bad since it is small."}
{"text":"I don't ever actually eat inside Melt, but I order it from UberEATS all the time. They have SO MANY vegetarian options. I love their tofu wings with BBQ sauce, and every sandwich I've gotten the vegetarian version of has been delicious. Also, their hangover fries are so good. The only thing I wasn't too impressed with is their fried green tomatoes (I'm from the south, and the tomatoes they used didn't have enough flavor). However, they more than make up for them with other things on their menu. For a vegetarian that wants options, Melt has so more options than any other restaurant I've ever ordered from!"}
{"text":"After hearing an unending amount of hype, we tried Melt Bar and Grilled on a Friday afternoon about 2:00 pm.  We timed it hoping for a slow time but the place was jammed and we waited 45 minutes to be seated.     So what is it that draws so many?  Perhaps in Cleveland we're desperate for something hip and trendy and this place has that vibe.  It's cool but with enough local references (check out the artwork on the walls) that you are reminded it's a local gig.  The menus are served on the back of classic albums and the beer menu is twice the size of the food menu.  What can be said about the food?  The sandwiches are basic flat grilled cheese on Texas toast with various fillings.   The names are cute and reflect Cleveland (\"Parmapocolypse\", anyone?).   ONE hour after placing our orders, our sandwiches arrived lukewarm with congealed cheese.  The handcut fries were dark brown (either from old oil or being overcooked) and tasted off.   The jalapeno sauce which accompanied one sandwich was a spicy treat but one needs more than sauce to make a meal.     Our overall impression is that we received the typical substandard fare you'd expect from any neighborhood bar with a greasy closet kitchen.   The difference here is that you'll pay a lot more for it.  I'll recommend Melt for someone wanting to sample unique drafts in a hip locale.  But eat somewhere else first.  PROS:   - Friendly wait staff - Hip decor - Fantastic beer selection  CONS:  - Wait time - Food quality"}
{"text":"We were worried that all of our anticipation of our first visit to Melt would make it impossible for them to live up to but they did. Our sandwiches where amazing.   My wife and I order two different sandwiches and planned on splitting them. Hers, the Italian and mine the Gyro, both tasted so good, piled high with meat, cheese and flavor! Their French fries are hand cut and seasoned perfectly.   The other side was a slaw and at first I looked at it and wonder if it wasn't just shredded cabbage with no sauce, I was wrong. The slaw had some very light sweet/savory sauce that we both loved that left our mouths with a very nice lingering pepper flavor. It was very unusual and we would love to duplicate but waiter when asked wasn't giving up the ingredient.   This was a truly worth while experience that when you include the service and beer list makes it a \"must\" while in Lakewood/Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good, but not stellar by any means. Certainly not the healthy place to go if that's a concern for you. It was a little pricey, but I think most people can get two meals out of it, because portions are huge! I did like the decor, and the service was great, so this is a place I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Was not bad . I'm not a big grilled cheese fan but my wife is so what the heck. It was good ."}
{"text":"While on town for a browns game, I took to my handy yelp app to find a popular lunch spot. This was at the top of my list.   I wanted something breakfast-brunchy, so unordered the egg and cheese sandwich . I love bacon, eggs, and cheese, so this was a no brainer. It's a very large sandwich that comes sliced and a large portion of fries (real potatoes). I was so hungry before ordering this, I had the buffalo chowder. It was sooooo tasty. If you love buffalo wings-flavor, you'd love this. It was tangy, spicy, creamy, ranchy, and included celery and green onions. Best chowder ever.  So glad we stopped in, and when in town, I'll melt again."}
{"text":"Oh Melt... This place never let's you down. The sandwiches are huge and can be dinner then lunch the following day. Their bar selection is great and they have many beers on tap. The food menu has a wide variety of options so no matter what your taste you go home happy. The parmageddon is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"With many facets of life, what might have been a 4 or 5 star experience in your 20's has a way of changing in your late 30's, 40's... (or vice versa).  I would have preferred this fatty, leaving me uncomfortable feeling, heavy food a few decades ago (or less..), now it just made my wife and I feel 'gross'.  Mac n cheese on grilled cheese for 12 bucks (pricey), paid the price for hours afterwards; bloated and fat feeling, cuz eating this will make you BLOATED and FAT (feeling, eventually looking..) it ain't good for ya!  Plus very busy, slow.  Tourists types seem to line up for this crap and obese people were rampant, in fairness so were skinny people (they probably see this more as a 'treat' than a regular occurrence, it's one HEAVY meal!)"}
{"text":"We were in town for the Tigers/Indians game and since I had been eyeing this place for the past year, I convinced my boyfriend to try it on the way home. I am so glad we did!!!    I honestly don't even know where to start. First, I had a pineapple beer that was ahhhhmazing. Then we had a couple gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches and fries and wow. Just so freaking good. Do yourself a favor and go here."}
{"text":"A really good experience. We stopped at Melt as we were passing through Cleveland coming home from vacation. We like to check out Triple-D restaurants (Drive-Ins, Diners and Dives) when we travel with our kids. This one did not disappoint. Terrific options, large portions, cool ambiance. We all really enjoyed our meals.  On the down side, while we expected to wait, even at an off time when the restaurant did not appear to be especially busy, we had to wait an hour for a table. That would get old if we were close enough to frequent this establishment.  Also, for all the inventive combinations and delicious jacked-up flavors on the menu, the cole slaw accompanying our sandwiches was very blah. The fries, however, made up for this shortcoming.  If you've got the time, this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Music is good, service is good, and most importantly the food is good.   Orange cream soda tastes like an orange creamicle and is really good of you want a sweet non-alcoholic drink.   I ordered the Hot Italian which was absolutely delicious. Meat overload!!   There's Vegetarian options and Gluten Free bread available for those who have restricted diets.   Our service was nice, quick, and correct."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and every time it has been nothing but incredible.  Warning: Come with a huge appetite. The sandwiches at this place are gigantic and I struggle each time to finish mine. I've tried something different every time and it never fails. I have had the Mac and cheese, chicken and waffles and buffalo sandwiches and honestly can't pick my favorite they were all that good. Menu has a lot of cool sandwiches and is very diverse. Also the atmosphere is really relaxed and cool. Definitely recommend stopping at this place"}
{"text":"Yes, there is a wait. Everyone knows this. Deal with it. The last couple of times I've went, I've gotten a spot at the bar in the first 15 minutes. If you want to wait for a table and there's 20 names in front of you, put your name in and walk down the street to Pacers for some drinks and come back in an hour. Like everyone says, it's worth the wait.   I've tried about 1/2 the menu and I've never been disappointed. As someone mentioned, you don't need an appetizer, although the pierogies are amazing!   Off the top of my head, the sandwiches (which all come w/ fries & (amazing!) coleslaw, range from about $8 or $9 to $14. And you can always create your own with the dozens of ingredients they have there. The portions are HUGE! I don't think I've ever eaten more than 1/2 my sandwich so you're basically getting two meals. If you're going w/ someone, I suggest both ordering something different and swapping a half so you can try more of them!   They usually have a side and soup on special and they are always interesting, unique combos and delicious!   The beer selection is vast and plentiful and the bartenders and servers are attentive and friendly.  As mentioned below, they give lots of info on the beer, like the alcohol content and a brief description.  I love picking out beers for my friends and trying something new each time.  This restaurant is definately an experience that never gets old!  MELT is a great concept and hugely successful for a reason!"}
{"text":"Funky downtown place with lots of great  beers and some crazy grilled sandwiches. Visited from NC and our family said we had to experience this place. Somewhat of a wait, come early. Really helpful wait staff, excellent food and plenty of it.Had 2 couples so we each ordered something different and shared, so much we boxed it up for later. This is a Cleveland must do when visiting, highly recommend....they even bring the Que Melt too y'all.  :o)"}
{"text":"AMAZING GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES!! I tried the Cheesesteak Melt for the first time at Melt and it was mouth watering goodness. I highly recommend this place and location because the staff are very friendly and courteous. Also, the atmosphere was on another level compared to many places I have been to. 5 STAR. 100%"}
{"text":"Melt is pure bliss. We went to the original location last Friday and only waited 15 minutes! Had The Dude Abides sandwich and could only eat half. Great beer selections, and a cool, funky place to eat. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of the premier food stops in the Cleveland area!   It's one of those spots where everything you order is fantastic. They also offer a wide variety of Vegan & Vegetarian options. It's a great and relaxed spot to come grab some exceptionally awesome food. I can't wait to come back to Ohio just to swing by here for dinner.   HUGE portions! Come hungry & be prepared to eat the leftovers for the next few days.  Atmosphere Rules, Services Rules, Food Rules, What's not to like?   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Greeted at the door, food was excellent and fresh.  My broccoli  and cheese was a little salty, but tasted good."}
{"text":"It is a very cool place. Great atmosphere but a bit loud.  I'm not sure if the hour wait is worth the sandwich. Next time I will just do take out. Even a fine dining place is not with an hour wait."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype of this place continues to be, been there a few times and each time its just a Meh experience for me. The sandwiches are built on an absurd amount of bread and I usually end up deconstructing them to eat them and skipping half of the bread. Fries are generally not very hot and really add to the carb/bread overload. The staff is generally very friendly but depending on how busy they are, it can be slow to get refills. Be prepared to order something that will taste good cold as leftovers or throwing half your meal away."}
{"text":"Always amazing food, drinks and service for a good price. Many vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"Ok so the hype is dying down and we were able to be seated without a wait.  Prior to this, we have only been eating takeout and I was less than impressed.  The decor is funky, eclectic Cleveland-esc.  The menu is interesting.  The tomato soup is amazing and the salads are fresh and generous in size.  Now we get to the prime reason to go to Melt- the sandwiches.  Yes you can get grilled cheese, plus a variety of specialty sandwiches and burgers.  They are all large portions and flavorful.  For my taste, they are much too starchy, with bread slices way too thick.  I am the minority opinion in my family, however.  Fries are good, cole slaw is different and with too much of a vinegar taste to suit me.  The Breakfast Burger stands out as a star item.  Beware the Pierogi Sandwiches. Service is attentive and pleasant.  Overall, a solid experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I headed to this place with a local friend and had a great time. We had a brief wait and were seated at a convenient place for the three of us with 2 children. The menu was somewhat overwhelming because of all the crazy options but I finally decided on one with pierogies, as I am from Pittsburgh. I actually was not incredibly fond of the sandwich, mainly due to the napa kraut, but it was a preference. The sandwich was huge as we're the other two at the table. My wife raves about hers and I really enjoyed the coleslaw (lots of onions and pepper made it unique) and the thick cut fries. The portions were massive to put it mildly... I had a second meal that was equally filling the next day. I look forward to going back and trying a sandwich with some meat on it.  Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"We drove from Toronto to see a few Cleve attractions. This place was high on my list of must trys and it didn't disappoint. I would go to Cleveland again just for this food. They should really just open up shop here in Toronto though. I should mention our server was great and helpful when we asked about other attraction in the Cleve. To be honest everyone we spoke to in Cleveland was nice, almost like we were still in Canada :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! The summer chicken sandwich is great! The monte cristo was just okay"}
{"text":"Great service, probably the most interesting décor I've seen, and food that greatly exceeded my expectations.  My wife got the BBQ pulled chicken and said it was the best chicken sandwich she's eaten in her life (and she eats a lot of chicken).  The Beef Brisket sandwich was the best that I've had, and the fries... wow.  Perfection.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've always been told how GREAT this place was going to be, even for those who don't love grilled cheese sandwiches. And i've also been told how long the wait was.  First, it seems like everytime I go (twice) no matter what time of the day, there's a 2 hour wait. What I don't understand is how inefficient the restaurant makes of their room layout. The place is so big and there are so few tables. Not just that, it seems like every time I go in, there's always empty tables but the wait is still 2 hours.   Now for the food.. i'm not a fan of grilled cheese sandwich and after melt, i'm still not a fan of grilled cheese sandwich. The sandwiches served here is just so oily and greasy. Despite that, the bottom of the my sandwich is always soggy and soft and not pleasant to eat.  To give Melt some credit, I can understand why so many people are in LOVE with this place. First, it is great for a group setting. Second, they give large portions so it's totally worth the price if you love the food. Third, the type of grill sandwiches they have are awesome. There's all kinds of flavors mixed together and different choices that it's pretty exciting to read and try through.  Do I think people should come and try this place? I do just because I do know a lot of friends who LOVE this place. I personally find it way too hyped up but definitely worth a try to see what you think of it!"}
{"text":"There's not much more I can say about this that hasn't already been said, but I want to add my two cents. Melt lives up to and far exceeds the hype. For all the complaints about how busy it is, it is worth every second of wait time.   I am generally skeptical of places that offer \"upscale\" comfort food, but Melt is the real deal. Nothing about it is pretentious, and the prices are great considering the amount of food you get. I visited Melt four times in my recent two-week visit to Cleveland, and I never once had a bite of food that was less than excellent. Melt is simply my favorite place on the planet.  Go early, or shut up and deal with the wait. It's worth it. Oh, an for the love of God, please don't be one of those people that orders Miller Lite at the bar. Melt has a fantastic selection of beers at reasonable prices to compliment their sandwiches, so take advantage of that."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday around 11:30 for lunch, party of four, and no wait!  The place was not packed and we requested to eat in the quieter side of the restaurant.   We all weren't sure how to eat our sandwiches because they were so thick.  Monte Cristo was delicious! The raspberry sauce came on the side and tasted fresh, with seeds and all. It wasn't thick and perfect for dipping. Indeed, my plate could have fed two people. Hubby really enjoyed the hand cut fries. I thought they were just okay. Mom-in-law had a half grilled cheese with salad and soup. Salad looked really delicious (had sun dried tomatoes) and tomato soup looked thick. The tomato soup came with a packet of gold fish crackers and it was served in a Christmas mug.  Everyone enjoyed their food. I put the other half of my sandwich in the oven and it was still quite good. Hubby said he would come back often if we lived by such a place. I would probably try a different sandwich if we ever got to come back.   Parking was in the back and you pay at one of the kiosks. I think the first 30 minutes are free."}
{"text":"On a recent day-trip to the Cleve, my girlfriend and I were told that we should stop in Melt - a place which exclusively serves variations on the Grilled cheese - before our show since it was in the area. I read up a little bit(Already having been sold on the idea) and decided it was a must.  So we finally show up at Melt, and the first bit of quirk we find is that instead of taking your name, they assign you a name on a nametag. I received the honor of waiting as Elvis. Tom Selek and King Tut sat on either side of me as we buckled in for the one-hour wait.  Now, don't be fool here - yes, the wait is long, but that belies the nature of this place. Melt has three times as much bar seating as it does table seating. Hungry? Saddle up. We could have grabbed seats at the bar within 5 minutes of our arrival - but since we grabbed a quick snack on the way up we decided that the hour would give us time to make room and grabbed beers instead. By the way, the selection here is great. Local and favorite crafts, a couple being rarities.  After about 50 minutes we were seated - the menus handed to us were printed on the backs of album covers. I got disco-pop superheros The Bee Gees while my girlfriend received contest-television star Paula Abdul. Everything on the menu sounds heavenly, with about 5-10 appetizer selections and 20-30 sandwich selections, it is fairly overwhelming. Having mental overload, I decided to play it safe and go with Yelp's favorite, the Monty Cristo. My better half chose the Parmageddon - being from Pittsburgh, we are suckers. Our eyes had originally caught the pierogies and the ultimate fries appetizers - but she got pierogies on her sandwich and you could upgrade the fries that came with your meal for $2.50, so we passed on appetizers. -- By the way, you can sub any cheese you get for their list of about 10, or add, or swap for vegan options.  Thankfully so, because you get a massive amount of food at this place. These sandwiches are stacked high, and everything else is piled on to the place. There is no negative space on this presentation - fries, cole slaw, and sandwich overwhelmingly take over the plate. My sandwich arrived deep fried in a copious amount of batter and sprinkled in powdered sugar. It tasted like half funnel cake, half delicious grilled cheese - magnificent I thought, but next time I could go without the sweetness for a more savory choice(Not to say it wasn't savory at all - it was a good mix).  The fries, cole slaw and parmageddon shine due to one thing in my eyes - an uninhibited use of an underutilized spice - black pepper! There is a monstrous amount used in this place, it permeates just about anything it can. It's a flavor I really enjoy, especially with the saltiness of cheese.  This cole slaw was also very good on it's own - while I usually like creamy cole slaw more, this was sweet and very good.  At the end of the meal, neither of us had finished more than half of our plate. Our takeout boxes had to have weighed a pound each.  We made a pretty big dent in my ultimate fries but hers were almost entirely untouched. The total bill(Minus our beer) was less than $25.  Why not five-stars? I feel like the service is a bit too laid back. Multiple times I saw food sitting up on the counter for a few minutes before it got picked up, which when food is being fried or grilled so heavily, those seconds can be precious. Also, I saw many parties leave and their tabled remained empty for up to 10 minutes before they were cleaned and re-used. In a place with probably a 2 hour wait period(When I left, I saw people I was waiting with still waiting - there are only about 15 tables) those tables should be cleared and re-seated in minutes.   I saw a lot of takeout orders go out, as well. Bottom line, this place is awesome. If you don't like long waits, feel free to sit at the bar, there is plenty of room. If you have a big group, maybe order takeout - I saw a girl leave with 9 sandwiches to go. But it is definitely delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and was told it would be ready in 35 min. Showed up after 30 min, paid the bill, and was told the order would be out in a bit. Twenty five minutes later I got my food, no apology. Bottom line, Melt: CLE Heights has serious issues with customer service. I've been here a bunch and have always had problems with the service. While the food is good it's not enough to overcome the abominable service. It's worth one try, but nothing more. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The waitress was really nice the food was amazing great location love the atmosphere had a zombie tiki drink. And got this little guy in my drink :)"}
{"text":"It was a great experience in the past went there a lot.  I lived right up the street from them their decorations jump out at you and the vibe is soo chilled"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough amazing things about Melt. My boyfriend is in a touring band and every time they go through Cleveland..this is a must. They've actually eaten here 3 times in two days. haha. After hearing a million times how amazing this place is, I finally got to experience this myself while on tour with them. OH MY GRILLED CHEESE HEAVEN. I think between the five of us, we've tried most of them. Their specials are fabulous so definitely check those out!! My boyfriend tells me that their special on 11/11/11 was the best thing he's ever tasted in his life! I got the one with the crab cakes. Most delicious crab cake sandwich of all time.   Need to plan a trip asap. LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"We visited this location for the first time today for lunch.  It was great!  Our food was so good and the server was very nice and quick which is always good when eating with a 5 and 3 year old.    We'll definitely be back.  I'm eating my leftovers right now, yum!"}
{"text":"There's no doubt, the food at Melt is pretty good (though I will say their perogies were disappointing, very dry).  Unfortunatly, I can't say the same for thier service.  I had been to the Cleveland Hts location previously and had no issue but this was my first experience at the Lakewood location and while I live closer to this location we won't return.  We found the staff to be unattentive and rude."}
{"text":"Always a good time with Great service and Great food.  They just added some new things to the menu like a couple burgers and a noodle salad which my wife and I really like. They are always running monthly sandwiches and specials. The beer selection and drink selection are also really good.  Had some small batch beers from Stone brewing time before last which was really great. Try the Gunslinger.  It's a slightly different take on a Moscow Mule and it's very, very smoove.  I prefer the Independence Melt (Kevin the bartender is super awesome) but all their locations have the same food and drinks.  Check them out, come hungry and try something new at the bar.  I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMFG. I can not believe this was the first time I ate here. 1st thing I would like to address are the haters.  I do not understand the hate. I really call it like I experience it. That is pretty much my mantra. Example: someone asks me\" do these jeans make me look fat?\" My answer is \"no eating at Melt makes you look fat!\"  Well  if your going to put really really unhealthy shit in your body, you had better seriously enjoy it! And this was 1st class unhealthy crap. By golly it was good to the last bite! This place was sandwich perfection.  I have not had a Monte Cristo since maybe college. And you know what?  It was worth the weight!!! Cooked to perfection with oozing  cheese, and a very crunchy outside, This was the most Kosher sandwich I had ever smashed down. This was a life changing event! No heart attack yet.  I split that and the meatball sandwich with a friend. There were multiple huge meatballs. I really could have split one sandwich but what the hell!  The fries were pretty tasty as well.  They were a little dark but well worth it!  Oh yeah and the beer selection is pretty fab. Lots of IPA's.  Melt you are a playa and I sure as hell don't hate!."}
{"text":"I honestly think melt is over hyped.  I've found sandwiches there in the past that I've craved but they either change them or take them off the menu.  The portions are enormous and do reheat nicely in the oven.. love their fries, and great bar selection.  I do like melt, but just don't think they're as great as ppl make them out to be."}
{"text":"If you've known me longer than five minutes, you know I have a passion for food: talking about it, reading articles and blogs about it, cooking it, baking it, writing about it, watching TV shows and movies about it, and just plain eating it.  I pretty much love everything about food.  That said, you can imagine my elation when I heard about a restaurant in Cleveland called Melt.  It's a much-buzzed about place that serves up superhuman-sized grilled cheese sandwiches.  Sure, you can order burgers and salads and a variety of appetizers, but the main event is their uber cheesy goodness on a plate. With the wait time exceeding three hours on some nights, you know the hype is worth investigating.   Our party of four adults and two children ordered the pierogis and spicy mushroom & sausage stew as our starters.  Both dishes were savory and the perfect way to prepare our stomachs for what came next. Between the four adults we ordered sandwiches called Westside Monte Cristo, Mushroom Melt, BBQ Chicken, and the Big Popper.  Words cannot describe how colossal these cheesy grinders were.  You have to see them to believe them!  Scott Bickel is a professional eater from a few towns over and we happened to be there the same night he conquered the Melt Challenge.  It was amazing just how many diners, fans and photographers they fit in to a small space.  I will admit, it was a thrill to be sitting two arm-lengths away from this guy and watching him devour what would take me three days to consume.  As he shoved food in his mouth, he wore headphones and bounced around.  After exactly 18 minutes, the meal was gone and only remnants of coleslaw remained on his face.   Personally, I give Melt a four out of five star rating.  While the space is cramped, the wait is long and the bread-to-filling ratio can be confusing, the flavor combinations are out of this world!  I see why so many magazines, newspapers and Guy Fieri gave this joint high marks.  I mean, who didn't crave melty cheesy bliss on toasty bread (with a bowl of tomato soup) for lunch when they were young?  Melt brings those feelings back, and changes the recipe just enough so you feel like you're reliving a happy part of your childhood in a gourmet kind of way.  I think the author of Treasure Island would agree, \"Many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese -- toasted, mostly.\"  Thank you, Robert Louis Stevenson.  Thank you, Melt."}
{"text":"I should confess that the only thing I eat here is the Westside Monte Cristo. I tried to branch out by going with their bratwurst sandwich once, and that is a mistake I would never make again. Not to say that it wasn't good, but the Monte Cristo is that much better, and I fear ever betraying it again (though I've got my eye on the peanut butter/banana). The Westside Monte Cristo is an already good sandwich that is brought to life by the donut-like batter, powered sugar, and the raspberry dip. Ohhh, the raspberry dip... I'm getting ahead of myself. Just order it, eat it, and thank me later.  The location is a nice one for me, since I only live a couple blocks away. The food is not nearly as good as the westside location, but on the plus side, the place is not nearly as busy. Between the two, I would rate this location a 3.5 and the other a true 4 due to food quality and overall atmosphere.  Decor is your typical sports bar and grill setup. Service is serviceable, but more attentive if you sit at the bar. Parking, like most places on the east side, is kind of tough. It's always packed, and I find myself parking in spots designated for nearby businesses not named Melt (with no issues to date).  Sides were not good. I'm just being honest. The fries were greasy and grease-flavored. The cole slaw was dry (no sauce at all?). Their sole purpose is filling out the rest of your plate.  One more thing to mention is their impressive selection of beer. Was able to try all kinds of beer I never knew existed. From high ABV, to foreign, to unique brews. Creme brulee beer? Yes, please."}
{"text":"My heart hurts thinking about what we ate there.  To try a couple of items on the ginormous menu, we ordered the gyro and the Godfather.  So the gyro was ok, not bad but nothing I would risk coronary artery disease for again.   But let's take a moment to discuss the Godfather, it's two pieces of buttery garlic bread oozing with cheesy goodness of a piece of lasagna in the middle.  The garlic bread is toasted perfectly and the lasagna would be great on its own.  This is a eat at your own risk type of place, not only because it has a lot of calories and cholesterol but because it's good and you might want to go back again and again."}
{"text":"We arrived at Melt with our hearts set on ordering the Tokyo Tuna (because it was featured on Diner, Drive-Ins, & Dives and I eat anything the Food Network tells me is good). Unfortunately, it was taken off the menu long ago (the episode is old). Instead, my boyfriend had the Lake Erie Monster (haddock fillet). I can appreciate their marrying 2 of my favorite foods (grilled cheese and fish & chips), but for $13.50 and a 45 minute wait (for takeout), we expected something a little more special. Our 2nd sandwich was the Parmageddon (pierogi grilled cheese). I obviously didn't have my head screwed on the right way because it didn't occur to me until after my food arrived that I just ordered bread sandwiched between two other slices of bread. It wasn't bad, but it is exactly what it sounds like--carbicide.  I did love the cute small park that's behind the restaurant. If you can't afford the time to wait for a table, the park is good place to scarf down the sandwich for which you'd wait 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Just a quick review since there seems to be some folks who still wonder if this place is 'worth the wait.'    I went on a weekday, at 5:30.  We got a table instantly, but those arriving at 6 appeared to wait for 10-30 minutes.  We also were able to enjoy their $1 off Draft Specials which mean most CRAFT BEERS were only $3.  They have an excellent, descriptive selection with the Style, ABV, and Price all listed so come here if you enjoy tasty libations.    The Menu is the same at the other locations.  If you're reading this, you're already aware that their unique fare is immensely delicious, comes with tasty fries and average cole slaw (could be creamier).  The Monte Crisco never disappoints.  I've had the burgers and while they are good, they're not leaps and bounds above other's ive had.  Overall, a great experience on Rockside, which has the same cool decor plus a patio."}
{"text":"I had to know what the hype was about! Very open, casual atmosphere. The food is simply oversized portions of the childhood favorite - thick cut slices of bread, well buttered, and essentially fried, filled with cheese and other goodies. I think everything is served with coleslaw and fries, though my fries were cold."}
{"text":"Can we put this disclaimer out there.. please do not eat for the whole day before going to this place until you got a tapeworm. They are known for grill cheese sandwiches well didn't say all the many combinations they have available!! So I had the Cleveland Cheese Steak. I could only half of the fully loaded sandwich. The leftovers were a tasty breakfast treat!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have enjoyed it. We tried it again last night and I was very disappointed. They have shortened the menu choices and raised the prices. I will give them props on their beer selection and beer pricing. I also particularly like the buffalo tofu appetizer, so I most likely would return for those items. The sandwiches...not so much!"}
{"text":"In town for business and this place was awesome. The staff was friendly and the food was a10 out of 10. Will return"}
{"text":"The Melt is a must visit every time I am in the Lakewood area. We live in Orlando, FL, so my visits here are rare but have been consistently good over the years. My grandparents live about a mile away, and I think I am the luckiest girl on the planet to have two things I love so close together. I love the Big Popper, and I usually order this grilled cheese. It is creamy, spicy, battered, and deep-fried. Holy hell, super delicious heart attack on two gravestone-sized slabs of bread. However, last time I got the grilled peanut butter and banana and hubs got the Cleveland Cheese Steak. The grilled cheeses are all great and all are very original recipes. The slaw is good, and the hand cut fries are super tasty. I would advise you to take a look at the plates on the tables around you before ordering to get a feel for the portion size. I think most couples could split one sandwich with sides. Most couples... my hubs simply refuses!"}
{"text":"I love cheese, but this was probably one of the worst \"cheesy\" restaurants I have ever been to. The tables are hardly clean and the environment is, I'll just say, not clean. The tables were greasy and there were crumbs all over it. They gave us a table right next to the kitchen and waiters and waitresses were running around our table trying to get food. At the front of the restaurant, inside a glass box, there were all these creepy Halloween, sculptures, I'll just say, and it wasn't even close to Halloween! Even though we had a nice waiter, the staff uniforms made me feel weird, uncomfortable-ish.  The food was way too greasy and the grilled cheese I ordered was as hard as a rock. Well, that's the only thing I ordered, so... The environment is not clean, and the food is not good."}
{"text":"The whole time we were eating, all I can remember is being insanely happy. I told my boyfriend that I was rating this 5 stars, no joke, despite some pitfalls like... um... my sandwich kind of sucked. But I was just so happy!   I guess that's what happens when you finally feed a tummy that's been starving for 4 hours and imbibe a little too much alcohol a little too quickly. But! I have to say, this could've very closely have become a 5 star review if they had just cooked my sandwich a teeny bit better.   I had the roasted vegetable sandwich. The zucchini, yellow squash, and eggplant were far too hard. They didn't seem roasted at all, more like steamed for a few minutes before making their way in between two enormously thick slices of bread. The bread was great but geez, I could not get my mouth around it. (Insert dirty joke here.) Some people have hated on the fries and cole slaw. I'm not going to lie. I enjoyed them a bit. Probably because I so rarely encounter fries that I turn into this fry eating machine when presented with a plate of them, and besides, the malt vinegar they put out is kind of fabulous on them. (I also put the malt vinegar on my sandwich because it needed something extra to give it a kick. Hit the spot there.) The cole slaw was not very dressed at all, but I appreciated it for its crisp and clean crunch compared to the greasy fries and big-ass sandwich. Did have a bit of a heat to it from the crazy amount of black pepper but I didn't mind.  My boyfriend ordered their house-made veggie burger with vegan mozzarella. Oh lord. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, don't bother with the grilled cheese sandwiches, go for the veggie burger. It is incredible and held together really well. We also had their vegetable of the day: broccoli in a pineapple soy sauce. It was also very lightly dressed. Seems like they don't really cook their vegetables fully and dress them with a heavy hand despite all the grease and butter all over everything else.   But... I was so happy the whole time! If you're looking for a meal to fill you up and hit the spot in that comfort, down home way, you'll find it here.  Biggest complaint, there seems to be a single coed bathroom in the whole place. It was absolutely disgusting when I went in after eating. Seriously Melt? Your place is SO popular so either have a person standing guard to clean the bathroom at all times or separate the guys and girls!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! Especially the chicken! It's always perfectly cooked, no fat and always crispy! People say it's too expensive but for the size of the sandwich you receive it's perfectly priced. I could never eat a whole sandwich, a half is plenty for most people. You can't leave here hungry!"}
{"text":"This place is worth a stop.   Comfort food at its best.  Service and the food was excellent.  Macaroni & Cheese Bites appetizer was exceptionally good.   Not so much good for you......but very tasty!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Melt countless times, I'm just waiting til my most recent adventure to restaurants to review them. I ended up at Melt about a week ago and had the same experience I always have: a superb one. I ended up getting the monthly special (The Firecracker Chicken) which was phenomenal, per usual. In my time going there, I've only had one sandwich that was below amazing (The Wet-Hot American Buffalo Chicken- too much bleu cheese for me, but that's a personal thing).  The food takes awhile to come out, but when the restaurant it stuffed and has a 30 minute wait on a Wed afternoon, that's what you should expect. Melt is nice enough you let you put your name in and wander around downtown Lakewood, no need to sit in their waiting area.   The servers are all very friendly and helpful. Our waitress came to check on us about 4-5 times in the hour we were there, just to make sure we were having the best experience we could.  Like I said, I've been to Melt probably 30 times and I have not one thing to complain about!"}
{"text":"VERY DISTURBING VISIT AND A WASTE OF MONEY, AND WORSE !!!  Took my mom there for lunch Sunday.. though the soup and salad were good, the grilled cheese sandwiches were almost all bread and the visit itself was very disturbing.   First, the sandwiches:   My mom got a mozzarella melt.. you could barely see the cheese as it was almost entirely bread.  I got the pirogi melt.. one, yes one pirogi.. covered with tons of bread.. a waste of money, a total waste of money and a ripoff.     On top of that the table changeover was stomach turning.. I watched them clear away a recently vacated table or two. they were wiping the table with the same rag/towel that they were wiping down seat bottoms.. The last thing I want is the table where I am served food wiped down with the same rag/towel used on chair seats. At another table,  I saw the bus person put the napkin dispenser, pepper and salt shaker on a chair bottom as we wiped down the table.. all totally inappropriate steps.  What was worse?  1. The sandwiches I would be embarrassed to serve to guests.  2. Table where food is served wiped down with rags/towels used on seat bottoms and other items including napkin dispensers also put on chair seat bottoms then the tables.  3. The waitress who agreed with me when I asked her \"Are you sandwiches mostly all bread\" which she responded to yes, they are mostly bread as we use texas toast.. saying that and not offering one iota of action to make it right.  The visit was very disturbing in many regards.. I will never go back.. I should have been refunded my money and given an extra $ 20 for being served such an meager sandwich, a sandwich served on tables I would not let my cats eat off of.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE.. I SHOULD GET A REFUND AND MORE FOR WHAT WAS SERVED TO US AND HOW THEY HANDLE TABLE TURNOVERS."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night with my 2 yr old son. Wait was about 15 min, but we didn't mind.  Food was great, staff was friendly and accommodating to the kiddo. Overall Greta first experience. Word of advice: come hungry (you'll leave satisfied)"}
{"text":"This was seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life!I have been to thousands of restaurants in my life and honestly this is the best sandwich I've ever had. I started off with the potato and onion Pierogis and they were absolutely delicious. For my lunch I get the Italian Parham with french fries.  The french fries were perfectly cut perfectly cooked same thing with the sandwich it was a breaded chicken breast I'm grilled sourdough with melted mozzarella cheese. If you are in the Cleveland area you definitely have to go here. It is worth the wait"}
{"text":"Was told we had an hour and a half wait at 2:30 on a Saturday, no problem we bellied up the bar and ordered 3 of my FAVORITE COCKTAIL EVER, the \"Kir Royale\". There were 3 of us so this is perfectly acceptable.   Another round of drinks later we actually got seated in about 45 minutes. At this point my lightweight mother was feeling no pain and I, the responsible DD had to sit out round 3. Insert sad face here.  Anywho, what I love about Melt is that you can make up your own sandwich and they are not rude about it at all. I ordered the mushroom melt and added turkey. It was amazing and so much better than the last sandwich I invented there. Loved every second of it and we had a great waitress.   Mom and best friend were quite chatty on the trip home after their 3 drinks of the delightful jesus juice and I was rather annoyed I hadn't brought grandma along to drive. Love it, would go back in a heart beat.  Only thing that sucks is parking BRING QUARTERS there are meters everywhere and the bartender told us they are strict on parking."}
{"text":"I'm in Cleveland annually for a conference, WMC Fest. In the 5 years I've been traveling up here, Melt is bar none both a \"must,\" and the best restaurant in Cleveland.   Greasy, unhealthily, glorious food, that is massive in quantity, and deliciously devilish. The amount of times I've walked out of there feeling like I'll explode, from gorging on their goodness, would be every time. Worth it. Every time."}
{"text":"When I was in Ohio for work I came to this restaurant twice. The first time I ordered the Mac and Cheese grilled cheese. The second time I ordered the Monte Christo. Both sandwiches tasted great after the first bite, but once I got to the fifth bite I was kind of over the food! The portion sizes are gigantic even if you order a half size! After a while everything becomes soggy and gross. I recommend this place for someone whose new to the are and or visiting and wants to experience something extremely different. I don't see myself visiting this restaurant again if I'm in the are."}
{"text":"This was a pretty busy restaurant. It has a bar type of feel to it with lots of tv screens and funky decorations. There was a dairy queen sign with some Easter rabbit lit up decorations near the bar. Since I just got into Cleveland the night before and felt gross after traveling, I ordered their chicken salad. The portions were very large, I couldn't finish it. We also ordered some appetizers - friend mac and cheese and tofu wings with buffalo wings sauce. I enjoyed both of them, but the fried twinkies were amazing! I never had one before, so I really liked the taste of the fried dough and cream filling of the twinkie. The only thing I didn't like about Melt was how loud it was inside. We couldn't talk to the other end of the table, but other than that, next time I'll  try the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Food was never disappointing until back in 2012 when I got food poisoning from their chicken something. Haven't been back to this location but still support the one in valley view.  Everyone deserves a second chance"}
{"text":"First time at melt. My company bought us lunch from the Avon location. I got the Parma, Italy. Let's just put it this way. Tasted like it was microwaved, the chicken was dry. Don't think I'll be getting or visiting a Melt again. Terrible. If I could leave zero stars I would."}
{"text":"So I've been a longtime fan of this restaurant. However, upon the first visit to my hometown branch of this local spot, I was extremely disappointed. You shouldn't have to wait 2 hrs for a grilled cheese lunch. The family next to me who were on the same time schedule left before they got served after probably waiting close to 3 hrs. (they had a disabled child). The restaurant is designed to have people wait with an enormous bar, ample waiting room, & limited seating. The Lakewood location had similar problems even after expanding. :( They have a great menu, decent beer selection, cute/quirky staff. Sorry owners this isn't how you keep customers coming back for more. I probably won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Now I know that there are some restaurants that people will automatically mention first when Cleveland comes up. Lola's, Farenheit, Table 45, Crop. Forgot about em. If you are visiting Cleveland go venture out to this place (or their new Cleveland Hts. location). It is what Cleveland is really all about. A bar that specializes in grilled cheese! They are affordable and how can you pass up a sandwich like the Parmageddon. The only knock I have on these guys is that you have to wait fo-ever to get a table. This is the only thing holding them back from 5 stars. However, it's a testament to how popular and good they are. Go here, then thank me later."}
{"text":"Trying this weeks special hot dog on gluten free bread! I luv that they hav g free. I've had them all so far this month and they r all great. Can't wait til next weeks- it has Fritos on it!"}
{"text":"Comfort food wrapped within a hug of the Cleveland bar vibe. It has the edginess of the cool bar (with a tinge of attitude from some of the servers) but nonetheless superb food.  A fan of the Chargers Street Gang (past Cleveland band with this restaurateur) I loved the rock edge of the album-slash-menus and the varied beer selection. My husband is from Europe and was giddy to try the deep fried Twinkies that he now craves. Alas I just partake in the buttery grilled cheese...believe me it's enough on it's own!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time when I was visiting Ohio and it was great. Fun atmosphere, big portions and cool drinks. If you're looking for a exciting/fun place to eat or hang with friends you can't go wrong. Service was also great! Will be going back again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Their foods are pretty special and tasty, even I ordered half size and still felt full. My friends and I waited for a while and their fries were a bit soft and not crunchy. However, I still recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Melt has great options for the sandwich lover in all of us. The sandwiches come out ginormous, and you have the choice between a whole sandwich or a half. The meals are also served with fries. Melt is definitely not diet - friendly, but it's a great place to grab a beer and some food. I would recommend the pulled pork sandwich, but all of their choices are great!"}
{"text":"OH. MY. LANDS. I LOVE this place!! I mean, I love everything about it - the decor, the waitstaff, the vibe, and of course the FOOD! Our waiter was incredibly insightful and attentive. I got the Fried Green Tomato BLT, which was fabulous. The flavors were just incredible and I couldn't have been more happy with a BLT. The portions are huge - big enough to share, if you want to give away your delicious food to someone else. My only issue was that the bread was really thick - which wasn't a problem for me, but they use the same bread for the kids' meals and my 2yo son had a hard time with it. I will be back every time I visit my parents. Every. Time."}
{"text":"Melt does not take reservations.  And it doesn't matter what time you go... if you want a table, you'll be waiting for an hour or more. But they make waiting fun - instead of you giving them your name, you get to pick the name of your reservation by pulling a name tag from a large pumpkin (e.g. \"Pookie\" or \"Dr. Claw\").  Here are some tips to get seated quickly - go at off-hours or off-dates like Halloween. Get there at 10:55 to eat at 11:00 am when they open.  Or vulture your way to a spot at the bar. That's how I've been seated in under 15 minutes every time I've gone since Melt got popular.  The beer list is great. The bar is awesome. The staff is friendly. The atmosphere is fun.  And then there's the grub.   I'd like to rate the food twice, because that's how many full meals I got out of my single-sandwich order. The portions are supergargantuanormous.  Most sandwiches are cooked on inch-thick texas toast and are substantially filled with cheesy goodness. The fries are fresh cut and piled high. The slaw is vinegar-based and is a great complement to both the fries and the sandwich.  So if my rating were on the food alone, I'd give it 6 of 5 stars served fresh, and 5 of 5 stars on day 2.   You can't go wrong with any sandwich. My personal favorite is the Big Popper - jalapenos in herbed crème cheese, in a sandwich that is breaded and deep-fried (like a Monte Cristo), served with a raspberry jam to dip it in. You can also create your own sandwich, or modify any of their options to tailor the taste to your particular palate.   Melt has quickly become a Cleveland legend.  If it weren't for the wait, I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Overrated. You can be inventive and have a big menu and a cool atmosphere but mediocre food. Fries were bland and burger had crazy stuff a on it but tasted like it has a bunch of random stuff on it. Burger meat was poor. Do yourself a favor and save your self some money and go to five guys or steak and lube instead. Note: this was for a visit Jan 15"}
{"text":"I decided to check out this deli on my way home from work.  I ordered take out.  I ordered Cleveland Cheese Steak melt.  What a huge sandwhich!  The fries were good, they were they kind that are cut with the peeling on.  The coleslaw that came with the melt was good, it was kinda spicey which surprised me but it taste good.  the Melt was on thick, soft, grilled to perfection bread.  There was plenty of shaved beef with lots of mushrooms, peppers and cheese... all very good.    I wish I had someone to eat with because the restaurant itself had a very fun vibe to it. The place was spacious, lots of funky art deco and very clean.  I'll be back when I have visitors...or make new friends out here LOL."}
{"text":"If you want amazing food, you will suck it up and wait. Best restaurant ever, enough said :)"}
{"text":"I hate this place, BUT when company from out of town come by they always want to go because they saw it on TV. I usually warn them, but what your guests want, one must provide.  A tip if you have to go there, eat before you go.  The food is sloppy and more often than not soggy or prepared incorrectly. Your server will always have a bad attitude. If you ask for it to be replaced, be prepared to wait. Don't bother replacing as your new meal will be just as nasty.  I've been to every location always hoping for the best, but now I just fill up before I go. I usually end up saying \"I told you so\" to our guests.  Maybe they were good at one time, but that time has been long passed. The very worst part is the service, or lack there of. I'm not a tip machine. If I get bad service,  you aren't getting a tip or at best, a dollar. I actually had a server follow me out and say \"hey, you forgot your dollar.\" When I told her that it was for her, she made a face and said \"if you don't like the service, why do you come here. This is how I pay my bills.\" I followed her in and talked to her manager who was \"SO shocked that she was rude to us.\" Didn't apologize. He just kept saying that's not like her.....*sigh* I really wish that they would pull it together. Clevelanders take pride in their city. Having visitors come to this place expecting greatness.....and getting the worst of the city, is heartbreaking.   Is it that hard? If so, maybe close or sell it to someone who can make it great again.  Gotta go fill up on chips now......"}
{"text":"I went to this place once, and had the Pierogi for appitizer, and the Big Popper sandwich.  IT WAS AMAZING!!!  I live in Chicago now, and whenever I hear my Cleveland friends talk about Melt, I get really jealous.  I wish one day they would open one out here.  The wait is really bad though, because the place is soo popular!"}
{"text":"If your visiting the Cleveland area or your a local like me, visiting Melt is a must. I always get the parmageddon sandwich here. The sandwich had pierogies, cheese (duh), and sauerkraut. What I like about it is it isn't as greasy as I thought it would be. I'm sure some other sandwiches on the menu are pretty greasy. But anyway all the times I have been to this location the service has been pretty average. Each time I've been here I've had to wait at least 40 mins for a table. I didn't give 5 stars because of how cluttered the place is. Seats are so close together it's hard to maneuver throughout. It's a struggle to get to your seat and your sitting so close to other people that you can't really hear the people at your table. The food is outstanding but I recommend coming for lunch or an early dinner to try to beat the crowd."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely fantastic! It is a little expensive, but the serving sizes are ginormous; we needed to share all of our sandwiches. The monte cristo sandwich was delicious, a must have. My brother loves the hot Italian and my mom was a fan of the brushwood club. Really, there is no bad sandwich at melts. Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"I would give Melt one star, but their beer selection is actually really good.    The food?  The sandwiches are dripping with oil and are overpriced and over hyped.  There is so much potential to do something amazing and delicious and Melt consistently fails.    What's with their slaw?  Too unbalanced with seeds and it needs to age before serving.  Notice how EVERYBODY leaves it on their plate?  Add this to loong waits and poor service, and I don't recommend Melt to anybody.  Go to Brennans for better dining all around."}
{"text":"First time visitor. Wait time we were told was1.5 hrs. (At 5:30 pm on a Saturday evening for 2 of us) but was actually less than an hour (!!+). But we waited nearly 45 min for our food. And when the couple next to us got their food ahead of ours (we were seated and ordered before them) there could've been a bit of a problem. It was hot and fresh though, and it came out right after theirs. True to other reviews, LOTS of food! Overall a decent meal, not too expensive but we both decided with a lot of places to pick from, if we're in the area again we wouldn't go out of our way to eat at a Melt again."}
{"text":"Was in the Cleveland area for work and found this place thanks to the wonderful reviewers on Yelp.   Three words for this place 'De-Lici-Ous'  Glad I don't live nearby or I would gain a ton of weight - but the food and the service at this place ROCKED!  Will definitely go back if I am in the area again!"}
{"text":"Sunday around 1:00.  Very busy.  They said 25 minute wait for the 2 of us.  2 seats opened at the bar within 3-5 minutes we sat there.  My hubby and I shared the Gyro Melt and it was delish!  I can't imagine anyone finishing their whole plate.  Everyone walks out with a to go box.  Sharing is the way to go!  We will be back but only on occasion.  Not a heathy choice at all but a great place to indulge once in a great while."}
{"text":"I walked in excited. I walked in interested. I walked in and Melt completely exceeded my expectations! As all my friends know I am \"The Queen\" of all things grilled cheese and this place definitely impressed me with their varieties and style. Service was cool, calm, and knowledgeable. The menu's were original as they were on the back of old record albums. The decor was everything Cleveland! Melt ... You are now my new favorite restaurant. Thank for your originality and deliciousness  If I could make one suggestion to Melt ... offer other bread choices.  The bread you currently use is good but it is so big and I think it would be nice if you were able to choose.  There are so many other great breads out there, use them!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while in town.  Several melt sandwich options for sure.  They are almost too much to eat and the bread can be a bit thick and hard to eat.   Cost us over $70 plus a tip for a family of four.  Way too much for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!  Finally got to try Melt today for my birthday with my mom. Although she is not vegan (and I am), we both got the special of the month - a Vegan Pulled Pork Melt... Droooooool... Simply amazing. The sandwich was so huge, that I have half left over. Fries were simple, appeared to be made from scratch, and there were tons of them. The sweet cole slaw was a bit different than I would have assumed, but not bad.   The beer selection. Wow. Very substantial and unusual.  We lucked out with getting a seat right away (about 3:30 pm) but I have heard this place is notorious for loooong waits.   Our fabulous (vegan) waitress was super friendly and did confirm the rumor I heard about a new Melt location on the East Side.   I'll definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited with my family for dinner on my recent trip to Cleveland. The December special was the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon Melt, so of course I had to get it.   Who can pass up: Hickory smoked bacon, black pepper crusted slab-cut bacon, maple bourbon glazed smoked pork belly, Italian pancetta, herb cream cheese with bacon bits, house-made bacon-infused mayonnaise, sharp cheddar, fresh romaine and sliced tomato?!  It was delicious and I was only able to eat half of the monster sandwich. I might get the Mayo and cream cheese  on the side next time - just a bit too much when the sandwich is hot.  But the sandwich was even better the next day, eaten cold. Think the best BLT you've ever had...   The rest of my party was very happy with their meals too and all left very full with no room for dessert.   Melt also has a great selection of craft beers, many from the Cleveland or Ohio area, as well as other standbys."}
{"text":"This place is on a whole new level in the grill cheese game. I had the hot Italian, which was good but I should have ordered without marinara. It was good, but huge even for the half order. It also came with AMAZING fresh cut fries and a yummy pickle.   The service was great! She explained the menu and even made some great suggestions. She covered the drink menu as well. I chose the electric blue lemonade which was super yummy.   I would defined th recommend this place if you get to Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Excellent spot! Great food & good service. They were able to accommodate a whole team of hungry teen hockey players & parents at the last minute. Everyone had a great meal. Sandwiches are huge! A half (not even) was more than enough for me & I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day! Great beer selection too. Mentor location is big & spacious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here right when they opened on a Friday morning.  The wait was 0 minutes and the service was excellent.  Not too loud either, and great tunes selections.  I also like their message board and their commitment to promoting local events.  However, the food left much to be desired.  I LOVE cheese and I LOVE bread, but what I expected to be a warm gooey crispy grilled cheese was soggy and room temp.  I also ordered a cup of turkey chili w/ cheese and what I got was cheese w/ a little turkey chili.  I understand the place is called Melt and they specialize in cheese, but it was OVERLOAD.  My friend got the fries w/ the works on top and that too was soggy and room temp.  Unfortunately, no matter how amazing the menu looks and how awesome the vibe of the restaurant is, I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"First off, the employees here are AWESOME! They are really nice and very cool. The only problem is that the sandwiches are MASSIVE! However, they are delicious."}
{"text":"Great bar atmosphere. Even better beer selection. Belgium Quads and several tasty IPAs. I had the Cleveland Cheesesteak. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with lots of nostalgia to look at. Just stopped in at the Mentor location, but I've been to the University Heights store as well. All are decorated similarly and the staff are always friendly and very laid back. Ray in Mentor gave us excellent service tonight!  There are a lot of beers in tap and a satisfactory selection of spirits. The menu has a few salads and soups and a small selection of mostly fried appetizers. The rest of the menu is grilled cheese sandwiches, of which there are MANY to choose from.  I've never seen so many choices of grilled cheese fillings! ...lasagna, perogies, fried Mac & cheese, egg, a burger, chicken, pork, ham, turkey, bacon, etc... nothing here is healthy. Heck, the monte Cristo is batter dipped and deep fried! There are half sandwich options as well which are decent sized.   The sandwiches themselves are huge and stuffed with tasty fillings, but I feel the bread is cut too thick and the cheese to scarce! Sadly, for being a homage to the grilled cheese sandwich, not one of us at our table of four could taste the cheese. They come with fries (tonight's didn't taste entirely fresh) or you can sub a vege that is generally sauced up. There is always a creative sandwich of the month to keep you coming back.   It's worth a stop if you love fried food or when you're needing to carb load!"}
{"text":"All I can say is,  OH MY!!!  This place is off the chain!  My first time in Cleveland and everyone I met said this was the place to go eat.  Boy, were they spot on!    Highly recommend the Cleveland Cheese Steak grilled cheese. Crazy!  Food was great! Service was awesome! (Sat at the bar and everything Sarah recommended was perfect)  Atmosphere is fantastic and really fun!  I will stop in here every time I'm in Cleveland, period!"}
{"text":"2 hour wait on a Wednesday night.  Sorry, it doesn't matter how good the food is if you turn away more people than you serve.  This place will be struggling to stay open through 2011. Mark my yelp."}
{"text":"Extra large sandwiches but when your paying $14  for a posted specialty Manhattan with amaroni cherries and the Bartender tries to give you maraschino cherries You politely ask for Amaroi. She tells you she's not allowed to give you more than one you ask her for two Because the menu clearly states CHEERIEST.  IKnow this sounds petty but anybody who drinks a good Manhattan will appreciate what I'm talking about bartender. The bartender refused to acknowledge me after that and I did not get any additional cherries.  As I was a former bartender  this was certainly not losing a customer over Which may be explains why this was the second and last time I will go in there and why there's usually not very many people in there I wish them luck."}
{"text":"Clean, modern, up to date and great service. A little pricey but it's worth it. Our server Brandon Lowe was very efficient, knowledgeable and gave us great recommendations on menu items. They offer a wide variety of delicious looking sandwiches and drinks. You have the choice of getting a whole sandwich or half and if you get a whole one chances are you'll be taking the other half home. Each sandwich comes with fries, chips or another option ( option is extra charge) and a pickle on the side. We ordered the Cleveland Cheesesteak (15.50 a whole sandwich)  (per Brandon) and it did not disappoint. The flavors were amazing and the meat was very tender.  For cocktails I had a prickly pear margarita which comes in a regular glass filled with ice, it was ok I'm just thankful it was happy hour so it was only 5 bucks. My significant other had a Melt City Light (draft)... it was just okay too. The lasagna bites we had for appetizers were pretty good. 55.00 for 2 people and hour at a sandwich place seems a bit much but it was worth the treat."}
{"text":"First visit. Ambiance is quite pleasant. It's inviting & fun! Great for everyone. Staff was very pleasant & patient, as we had a senior party. Lol! .  Food was delicious. Omg, the best tomato soup ever, dense & very tasty. If I could do anything different, it would be to slice bread for  sandwiches much thinner. Then guest could much more easily \"bite\" into it. It's simply impossible to actually pick sandwich up & bite into it. But, then again, they're successful at their business! # satisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"Yum...everything on menu is a winner! Awesome sandwiches & great fries. I did try May's special \"street corn\", made with cilantro, lime, special cheese...fantastico! Ambiance is laid back, very nostalgic decor & soft lighting. Hospitality was very friendly & welcoming! Which we all know, hospitality is half the pleasure of dining out....shout out to Bean, our awesome hostess. #satisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"Oh goodness!! Where do I begin.   I didn't want to go out, I've had a headache all day and I've been incredibly moody. But, my main squeeze talked me in to getting out of the house.  So, we went to Melt. You can't go wrong with a sammich from Melt! The chicken soup to start, perfect with the gold fish. One of my favorites.  So, when it comes to ordering my sandwich. I was confused. Because I wanted a few different ones. Our server said, why don't we make a special one.  MIND BLOWN!! So, we started to create the perfect pms sammich.  Mac n cheese Mashed potatoes  BACON Cheese  Toasted bread. Omg, when it came out. I was the happiest fat kid EVER!! Thanks for making me less stabby."}
{"text":"Melt is a favorite featured restaurant on food network and travel channel, and pretty unique as far as sandwich joints go, especially in Cleveland. I like to take my out-of-town friends here to show them one of the famous yet inexpensive option in the Cleveland food scene.  That being said, there is a lot that Melt leaves to be desired. For example, be prepared to wait if you come at prime dinner time, even on weeknights. And I don't just mean the 40 minutes you will have to wait to be seated. The waitstaff is not very prompt in greeting you, taking your orders, or catering your small requests for ketchup, more water, etc. The bar, too, is usually quite swamped, so although you may choose to eat your meal there, don't assume that it will automatically make the wait for food any shorter.  I've tried almost two-thirds of the grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu, and all of them taste pretty good. My favorite option the Chorizo and Potato. Be warned that Melt's sandwiches are HEAVY. Most of the time, I can only finish half of the sandwich and barely make a dent in the fries and cole slaw. Now I usually share with a friend, and still, its plenty of food. The dishes other than grilled cheese that I've tried (including tomato soup, salads, pierogis, and bread pudding) have all been mediocre, unfortunately.  My conclusion: Melt's a bit overrated, but its worth giving a try."}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to be too hipster-y for me but I was pleasantly surprised. They have an amazing beer menu and the sandwiches are incredible. I had the Korean War Pig melt and was blown away. The fries are really good but totally unnecessary. We got the peanut butter bread pudding and unfortunately it wasn't very good. Would definitely come back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Grilled Cheese Mecca.  I haven't been to the original location. Yet.  My group stopped by the newer of the two after the Browns-Steelers massacre.  The wait for 4 was an hour to an hour and a half.  Two of us sat at the bar to wait for the other half of our party where I got heckled for my fabulously GOLD Steelers hat.  (Oh well, it's not my fault your football team is a joke.  Some Clevelanders could take a cue from my beloved Buffalonians; realize that their team sucks and just have fun with it!)  We grabbed a drink (I, a Caipirinha; The dining companion, a draft pear cider) and just ended up eating at the bar which is probably why we had such a great time.  Our neighbor to the left was a riot, as she enjoyed her last evening of family-free sanity.   Anyway, on to the food.  The french fries on my plate disappeared with a quickness.  They were probably some of the best fries I've ever had.  Definitely blanched in mass quantities and then cooked to order right before your plate is sent out.  Fabulous.   I got the spinach pie, with bacon.  mmmmmm Adding bacon is always a smart move.  My dining companions tried the monthly special (a paprikash concoction), the Tokyo Tuna and the Winter Chicken.  I didn't hear any complaints.  The paprikash was gonzo, so I took the rest of those fries with the half of my sandwich that I couldn't finish.    Next time I'm in town, I'll hit up the original locale prepared with a snack for waiting and great company."}
{"text":"I'm slightly disappointed with many of my favorites being removed from the menu.  Blackened and winter chicken gone, along with several others. Also, you no longer get the slaw, only fries. This was my favorite place, but now not so much"}
{"text":"Melt has finally opened up on the West/South-side.  My girl and I entered for a late morning treat and beat the crowd, which arrived by the time we left around noon. The Menu is a bit over whelming with all its choices.  Not knowing what to pick, I went with a blackened chicken.  My girl chose Monte Cristo.  We both had a cup of buffalo chicken soup and it was delicious. I was a little disappointed with the chicken; it was dry and bland, although flavored on the outside of the meat. The Monte was quite the treat...in a French toast fried shell, and a fruity sauce...perfection. Both dishes served with heaping piles of French fries (fresh cut) and Cole slaw.  The pommes frites were delish but the slaw lacked something.  I hope this is fixed. I really was anticipating a higher rating, but based on the dry meat, and flavorless slaw I rated according.  Love the atmosphere.  Will probably be back.  Price for serving size seems spot on."}
{"text":"A great sandwich place that you can't go wrong with! My absolute favorite that I have a hard time straying from - Chorizo and Potato with a added egg! Awesome homemade fries too! Perfect for malt vinegar :) I am not a fan of the cole slaw though - it is spicy and I like more of a sweet slaw. I have tried many of the sandwiches and all are huge and good! If I had to pick a second favorite it would be the Dude Abides - Can't go wrong when u have mozzarella sticks inside a sandwich! Parma, Italy and the Parmageddon are on the very tasty list too :)  I love this is a Cleveland company and would def recommend it to people visiting the area! Plus it's been on the food network show - I love eating at the places I see on there!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place because everyone raves about it and it was also featured on Triple D!  The wait is ridiculous on a Friday or Saturday night.  So we went first thing on Saturday when they opened...we were seated immediately and the food came out quickly.  First off, I'm not a huge grilled cheese person so I had the Fish and Puppies.  The meal was HUGE and I ate less than half of it.  The fish was cooked well and tasted really good.  The portion was just too big for me.  The service was great, our waitress definitely knew what she was talking about.  I would visit here again, but next time would share a meal with someone."}
{"text":"YUM! I came in with a huge group.  We had to wait a while but this was no big deal as there is a huge bar with tons of different (Reasonably priced!) Beers.  There are also tons of tvs with sports channels... Definitely helped to pass the time...  For dinner I had the bacon and egg grilled cheese... um hell yes... There was a ton of bacon on it and the egg was perfectly cooked. The bread was crispy... Super filling! I had the half fries half slaw on the side.  You still get a huge pile of fries! And the slaw wasn't dressed with mayonaise which I really liked.   No. The food here isn't health food.  But if you're passing through Cleveland and in the mood for some guilty pleasure I highly highly recommend. This place did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Melt is very unique, and has a distinct hipster feel. There can be a bit of a wait, since there is not a ton of seating. These days we are in the 5:00 dinner crowd due to our small child so not an issue for us. We have learned that its not a great idea to go out to eat at 7pm, if your child's normal bedtime it 8pm. Your welcome.  They do not have a kids menu. We ordered our son an entire meal thinking we could take home the left overs. We could have EASILY also shared our food with him. All the sandwiches were delicious. I can personally recommend the September Special - the Flying Felafel. It was very good!   There is a large drink menu, craft beers and soda. All in all a great dinner out. I have no complaints about the sandwich, the service, the atmosphere, or the drinks. I did think that the sides were peppered too much. All sandwiches come with a side of coleslaw and fries, and these were great except for the amount of pepper! The coleslaw was good - it was fresh, light, crisp, and could have been so much better. The sides we got had so much pepper that it was almost border line inedible. Here's hoping that it was an off night for the pepper shaker . . . . ."}
{"text":"Hated this place! It was dark, dank, crowded & tight, hard to read complicated menus (plastered on old record covers; a cute idea, but I couldn't read the small print in the dimly lit room) bring a magnifying glass... noisy, expensive, tight crowded seating, poor service-took forever to get my sandwich, sorry but it shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a grilled cheese sandwich. Hard to eat thick slices of bread - how the heck can you get a 3 inch tall sandwich in your mouth. The bread slices are an inch thick, slathered with butter or oil (not sure what they use) a small amount of filling in comparison. Basically an artery clogging heart attack on a plate! Served with cold fries, My sandwich was all wet from the pickle juice it was sitting in from the garnish pickle slice \"INEDIBLE\"  The decor consists of hundreds of Halloween & Christmas light-up lawn ornaments lit up with strings of twinkle lights here and there (cute two times a year, but I don't want to see snowman, rabbits, pumpkins and Santa while having dinner lining the walls.  If you don't mind all this and are willing to spend an average of $14.50 for a greasy grilled cheese sandwich, then go. Otherwise you have been warned."}
{"text":"Really good food for a good price. Just make sure you go on an empty stomach and you're ready to engorge yourself. Portions are huge and food is heavy."}
{"text":"Abnormal grilled cheese, abnormal place, abnormally great.  You like jalapenos, cream cheese, and funnel cakes?  Get The big Popper.  A deep fried grilled cheese sandwich with the previously listed ingredients.   Their french fries are also tasty.  Check out their website for their list of many different sandwiches.  The bar is very large, and they have many great beers on tap.    I have been here only once, and it was just before noon.  Melt looks like a lot of fun later at night.  (They were having a Big Lebowski viewing that night.  My generation's Easy Rider!)  The only bad thing seems to be... get there, and get there early.  The line builds astonishingly fast.  It is easy to see how this place is becoming a Cleveland icon."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. Better than the one in Lakewood because it's bigger and you don't have to wait as long for a table."}
{"text":"How long can a true American wait for a perfect burger?  40 minutes? 2 hours? Lifetime? Speaking hyperbolically - probably even a lifetime is not all that long for devoted patrons of the certain restaurant.  \"Melt\" in Lakewood was overcrowded with people eager to invest hard-earned cash into the clogging arteries on a regular Tuesday night. (I would not even dare to go there on a weekend - it must be an apocalyptic scene!). I am not a health-conscious freak who is going to lecture you about cholesterol level.  I am well-known for waking up in the middle of the night, sleep-walking to the fridge, making myself a triple-decker of a sandwich and then devouring it in bed (waking up in the morning holding salami in my hand is particularly traumatic to my conscious and some witnesses of such an act). But this is how I prefer to violate my code of healthy eating:  fast, half-sedated, drunk, or if I am really going for it - the unhealthiness needs to be disguised with fancy salads, exotic drinks or some ethnic cuisines.  So waiting for the cheeseburger loaded with fried eggs and French fries loaded with lard in a lobby of a restaurant that reminds you of Greyhound station at the best was somewhat torturous for me.  I thought about how much time will it take me to burn my future meal on the treadmill, how I will lie about my weight to my mother again, how she won't believe me, about the Guess jeans I bought on sale and will fit in them only 10 pounds lighter....Anyway waiting was fun as you see. Don't get me wrong. My cheeseburger was as good as they come, French fries were French, and pear cider was delicious. But by the time we got a table I (already delirious from hunger) ordered an appetizer (Huge Mistake), went to the bathroom 4 times ( 2 tall glasses of cider!), and by the time my cheeseburger arrived I took two bites and was ready to fall asleep.   Down Side:  Long wait, 2 hours on the treadmill to burn it off, long wait. Up Side: He will love you even one meal and 10 pounds later"}
{"text":"Went on a summer Monday evening at 8.  No waiting, but was busy.  The host was a bit odd. It's like he was nice and cocky at the same time. I told him we had 3 (I walked in by myself as the others parked).  He asked if the rest of my party was with me. I told him they were parking and his tone changed and he said, 'I was just asking.' Which made me do a double take and wince my eyes as in, did you just talk to me like that!  So I had to reply with, 'okaaayyy, I was just answering your question.\"  So, moving on past that bit of uncomfortableness...we were seated.  Now granted, it was 85 degrees out.  But they have a ceiling full of fans that were on high.  I was freezing.  But you know it's bad when my husband and my   15 year old, 6 foot, 200lb rugby player, are shivering and complaining of how cold it is.  We mentioned to one of the servers about it being cold, and she said they could lower the fans but not turn them off.  It helped a little.  Was surprised no one else sitting had asked about that.  The service was a tad slow. Didn't bother us , it was busy.  I think we took one of the last tables.  All the tables outside in front were taken as well.    On to food. Unsweetened ice tea was good.  I always comment about the ice tea, because some places have bad ice tea with bad after taste.  This one was good. We got the Mac-n-cheese bites as an app.  I expected small little half dollar sized things like you get at most places. But not here!  You get 4 good sized \"bites\"!  Each one was like a mini meal in itself.  They are served with some sort of yummy cheesy sauce on the plate too..OMG, these were the best ever!!! We loved them!  However, moving on to the sandwiches was disappointing.  I got the summer chicken sandwich. I did take off the top bread and eat it with a fork and knife, but damn was it DELICIOUS!!  That was not the disappointing part.  Now I must point out that I had been to the original melts in Lakewood years ago. The crazy wait times and the tasteless dough/carb wad the parmegeddon I had there turned me off to ever going back for the last few years.  But now I'll keep coming back as long as they keep the summer chicken (hint hint: please keep through the winter too!).  Now the problem happens with my husbands and 15 year olds sandwiches.  The novelty of there giant bread cheese sandwiches is just that, it's a novelty that everyone seems to buy into and keep this place busy.  But like I said, we didn't, after that 1st experience, it kept us away for years!  But here we go again, reminded of the issue with the sandwiches.  My husband got the chicken and waffles grilled cheese.  It looked great.  The problem, it was bland and tasteless! All that bread took away from it.  The same with my 15 year olds mushroom grilled cheese.  He was disappointed in lack of taste.  I think they need to consider focusing on ramping up taste in the middle of the sandwich so it comes through all the bread, and perhaps also consider doing open face melts!!! A nice cheesy bread base with some awesome tasty fixings on top eaten w/a fork and knife.  Save the bread! Forget the top layer of bread!!    In the end, I'll be back for those bites and that summer chicken.  And the hubby and teen will probably try something else if not they will get that summer chix too."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to eat. Big portions nice atmosphere. A little pricey but you get a lot."}
{"text":"Whoa. All i can say about my \"big popper\" sandwich would be that word b/c my mouth is too full to say otherwise! A friend took me here for my first foray into Cleveland, and i'm so glad she did! The beer selection was GREAT, the options for food were overwhelming (but in an awesome way) and the decor was quirky and cute - just how i like it! I imagine this is a great place for a first date but regardless of why you're there, you'll be happy you are! Food/service/price were all fantastic and there was a great variety of people there over the 3 hours we ate, talked and drank. Go there! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Still tastes good, but $15 for a steak (pulled beef) sandwich that didn't have hardly any meat or mushrooms is not worth it anymore. Additionally only one half had onions and peppers, no sauce, the other side had sauce no onions and peppers. I wish I had shown my server before I ate any of it. The other sandwich we got was stacked with meat. Too bad."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a dinner last night. I've been to Melt before, but only to the original Lakewood location. I know there's a long 2 yr wait to get a table. I knew the Mentor location would not be as bad and that we would get seated right away. Boy, what did you know? I was right.   Now, the major difference between this one and the original location is the amount of space. I like the Lakewood one because it's tiny, jammed with people, and because of its tiny space and crazy decor, gives the space a great sense of character. I don't really think the gigantic space in Mentor can really pull it off quite the same way. It makes it seem more commercialized and a little less special.   Anyway, we chose to sit on the patio to enjoy the warm air. Now, in the past 5 years I've lived in Cleveland and eaten on several patios around the greater area, I can honestly say I've never encountered the problem I did last night. A woman who sat down just as we were finishing our meals was smoking a cigarette, and I'm sorry, but I'm eating my food and I would really love NOT to smell your cancerous stick or your cancerous stench or have your nasty ashes flying onto my plate. Thank you. I asked the waitress if this was legal and she said it was.   Now, I'm not a restauranteur nor am I an expert, but from a patron perspective it's a little disgusting and majorly offensive to allow people to smoke when there is food around. There HAS to be some kind of food safety violation. This whole incident really put a damper on my eating experience.   Anyway, food was fine. It's super heavy and almost sickening. I don't remember since it's been a couple years since I've been to melt, and I don't remember not enjoying it when I did go. Maybe my tastes have changed."}
{"text":"Melt is a restaurant that we visited a few weeks ago. The service was not very good and in fact we thought that the waiter was not very friendly at all. Then when the food case we asked for a side of ranch which took 20 minutes to come to the table. Not sure if we will go back."}
{"text":"I have seen this chain on many shows and it always looked great.  I am a huge fan of grilled cheeses so had to check it out.  Very extensive menu with a lot of creative takes on a grilled cheese. It was a very cool, laid back décor.  I came at lunch alone so sat at the bar.  The server was really friendly and kept my Diet Coke full.  My sandwich was a basic with American cheese and bacon.  It was awesome!  Fries were really good and the honey mustard on the side was phenomenal.  I ended up dipping my sandwich in it.  I'd come here more often if they expanded."}
{"text":"I had no idea this was such a hotspot in the Cleve area.  We tried to go on Sunday night but it was too crowded.  A two hour wait is not possible with a 2 year old so we split.  In that time, two separate employees were pretty rude to people waiting.  Despite this we made the trip from downtown for a late Monday lunch.   We were seated pretty quickly and got our drinks and were good to go.  The palce is decorated rock and roll style.  There are comics with kids looking at records.  Minor Threat, Iron Maiden, The Cramps, so I know this is my kind of place.  It reminds me of Kuma's Corner in Chicago but with Grilled Cheese.  I was digging my local Great Lakes beer and waiting for my food.    Good lord do those sandwiches come out slow.    We were seated by the food window and there was maybe one sandwich popping out a minute.  I could see about 5 guys back there moving around.  So we waited about 45 minutes and was tortured by giant meat filled sandwiches going past us.  All I could see was melted cheese, meat, and beer all going to other tables.  I watched our waitress go to the window every time a plate would pop up checking to see if it was hers.  Ding! Finally we got some food to our table.  I got the Godfather.  It is lasagna on garlic bread.  It was pretty good.  The garlic was raw so it gave you that sharp spicy flavor along with the cheesy saucy lasagna.  The old lady got \"The Lake Erie Monster\".  It was fried walleye and American cheese.  There was a jalapeno sauce that was pretty tasty.  I would have liked a plate of the fried fish.  It was really good.  Then we got the boy the \"Grilled  Peanut Butter and Banana\".  This title is quite literal.  The sandwich had cream cheese and a berry sauce to dip in.  All in all the sandwiches were pretty good.  The clouds did not part and no earths were shattered.  It was our most expensive meal in the Cleave but not the best.  I loved the idea of it and the bar itself is cool, I would come back but not with a wait."}
{"text":"Very good food. And lots of it. Staff was friendly and very attentive. Comfortable place to sit and enjoy a meal. Parking a little tricky, especially with it snowing. Enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"Refreshing place to eat. The prices are reasonable. Portions are huge so you may want to share"}
{"text":"DEEEELISHHHH, seriously.  i have heard  some people say just toooo much bread, too big, too this, too that.  but in my humble opinion, how could you ever have too much of anything???  i am a girl who LOVES sauces and condiments. like loves them. i would seriously marry a bottle of mustard if i could. sad, isnt that??? ok, on to better things. back to melt. schmelt. they have theeee best condiments for dipping your heavenly plate of fresh cut fries in. they are all made in house and they are just fabulous.  i have had a few different sandwiches and i have to say they were all superb plates of heavenly goodness. they are HUGE. like HUGE. always enough to have for lunch or dinner the next day. the piergi one is awesome. its a plate of comfort food in a sandwich form.  i always feel like a big beached whale after my dining experience here, but i wont let that inhibit this girl from going back to melt. it warms my heart.  beer selection is good.  atmosphere cool vibe.  servers all have fun eclectic personalities.  go. eat. there. now.  that is all. bye."}
{"text":"huge. fan.  i love choices. i love lots of choices. if you read any of my reviews, i make this a known fact.  melt has a lot. especially yummy dipping sauces for their amazing fresh cut fries.  a lot of people think that these sandwiches are TOO huge. huh?! how can that even be stated? hello lunch time leftovers. i love leftovers! the turkey sandwich special they typically have in november is delightful. turkey, cranberry, potatoes. i dont even know what else is on it? the kitchen sink?! seriously. the bread is soooo good. be prepared for a HUGE lunch/dinner and go hungry.  craft beer selection is good.  i honestly can not rave enough. i love melt and am beyond thrilled every time i head here. i am thinking maybe dinner option tonight! :)"}
{"text":"Great food amazing service and just all and all really cool venue. The staff was really nice, chicken and waffles is the truth !!! Lol #iRockParties"}
{"text":"OH-EM-GEE.   I've seen the Man vs. Food episode atleast 10 times. My mouth waters every time I see it. I day dream about it. SO, when we planned a trip to Cleveland...I just had to go here.  I wasn't disappointed. Sure there as a long wait, but there were seats at the bar - EVEN BETTER.  Great draft selection. Ice cold. And our bartender wasn't pushy or rushing us to make a decision. Laid back. My kind of place!  The food. Soooo many decisions. I got the Big Popper. A-MAZE-ING. A fried sandwich with a fruit dipping sauce...to make it healthy! Hubby had the pizza roll, he devoured it.  So good, if there's a wait, it's worth it....the sandwiches are huge, give people time to finish and enjoy them!  Don't forget to leave lovin' on the chalkboard in the ladies room!"}
{"text":"I love melt.  I don't go there a ton, but am never let down when I do go there."}
{"text":"I must say that Melt is an amazing place to try various entrees of cheeses. The portions and prices are very generous and makes to have a great time while dining. The most annoying thing about Melt is the wait time. I understand that waiting for a great service and food is expected, but sometimes the wait is 2.5 hours! I'm sorry, but I am not waiting 2.5 hours to eat, that's an airplane ride somewhere. My limit is usually in the range of 30 minutes to 1 hour TOPS. We got lucky and went between 2-5pm, so the wait was 20 minutes. The menu was so delicious just to look at, I couldn't decide what to eat! Even though the Melt challenge tempted me, I knew I did not want to ruin my first experience at Melt possible rolling out of the restaurant. I decided to try the Grilled Peanut Butter, Banana, and Cream Cheese  sandwich that came with fries and slaw. All I have to say is AMAZING! I have never tasted a sandwich like that and was very impressed. The portion was so great that you could get overstuffed on just that. The selection of root beers was very cool. For dessert, I had fried twinkies. Although very yummy, it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. If it wasn't for the constant long periods of waiting for a table, i would give it no less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great food. Interesting sammiches. All are priced around $10. They are very big sammiches though and my guess with drinks and fries there will be more than one person in your party taking leftovers home. Great beer selection. Very cool atmosphere. Good for kids too. RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"So, it's really hard to find fault with Melt's offerings.  I certainly love their vast vegan and vegetarian options, and their beer selection is relatively diverse and includes somewhat hard to find options.  Cocktails, from what I have sampled, are well made.  My only complaint would be the cost per portion; It seems a bit pricey for a mushroom grilled cheese and fries to be priced above $10.  I remember a few years back when the cost for the same was in the single digits, and not only came with fries, but with cole slaw, which is now an extra expense.  That said, I understand the laws of supply and demand, and if Melt can offer their dishes at an elevated cost and maintain business, good for them.  Personally, my patronage has declined in frequency because of the prices, but I always enjoy the splurge when my wallet is feeling generous."}
{"text":"Great Brasserie de Silly Pink Killer beer real flavorful! Great beer selection! Strong and good orange creamsicle martini with whipped cream and orange slice to boot. The Monte Cristo was real good but a lot more bread than filler / The Parmagedoon was a real unique combo of flavors but a little on dry side. The server Melody rocked! All in all, I'll be back."}
{"text":"The Buffalo Chicken soup is wonderful and I always get the Kindergardner grilled cheese, but I have noticed that the quality of food, service and portions have gone a little downhill. Still yummy, but not worth an hour wait time to get a table."}
{"text":"When I have people come visit from out of town, I always take them to Melt.  Having been there at least a dozen times, I will try to summarize my experiences into one hypothetical experience:   I went to Melt the other day and waited for 3 hours even though it was the middle of the afternoon.  There were a bunch of punk kids watching Voltron on the TV in the bar drinking obscure beers with funny names.  While I was waiting, I enjoyed a draft cider while I looked at the nostalgic pictures throughout the restaurant, which felt suspiciously like my uncle's basement.  When I finally was seated, I ordered a cup of soup, because I had heard that I would probably have to wait another hour for my sandwich.  The soup was good - it was something unique and boldly flavored that I would not be able to get anywhere else.  I ordered a grilled something-or-other, which came out greasier than I expected, but I guess I should have known what I was getting into considering this place's reputation.  I couldn't tell whether the coleslaw was really good, or if I just liked it because my body was trying to convince my brain to do something other than finish my sandwich.  But finish my sandwich I did - all 3200 calories of it.  After spending half the day there and eating a week's worth of saturated fat in one sitting, I was absolutely exhausted, so I went home and went to sleep.  I'll probably come back in about a week or so and do it all over again."}
{"text":"best grilled cheese ive savored but not the best food ive savored. great belgian beer selection.  i enjoyed st bernadus abt 12 with my tokyo tuna melt for lunch.  the bar gets filled up real quick and by noon theres at least an hour wait. they offer carryout but grilled cheese is best served quickly so the cheese doesnt firm up on you. reheating is no way to enjoy a grilled cheese sandwich of this caliber."}
{"text":"Can I tell you just HOW excited I am that they finally put the Mighty Mac and Cheese on the menu all the time other than just one month per year!!!!! JJJJOOOOYYYY!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a lot of food! Definitely go with an empty stomach. I like the sandwiches on the menu, but don't eat here often as it is very rich and hearty. Worth a visit if you've never been here before"}
{"text":"Melt is soooo good! The place is always super busy and a little noisy inside, so we usually order our food for carry out. I try to get a different sandwich every time I'm there, but my husband is loyal to his favorite, which is called \"the dude abides\". His is basically a meatball sandwich with mozzarella sticks and marinara sauce - really good. My favorite that I've ever ordered is called \"new bomb turkey\" which basically tastes like thanksgiving on a sandwich. Delicious!    I really don't know if you can go wrong with anything here. Everything I've had has been sooo good. I've tasted the Parma, Italy; the cleveland cheese steak; the curry chicken melt; and the peanut butter banana.   The portions are huge, and I usually save the other half of the sandwich for later. If I heat it in the toaster oven, it tastes just as good as the first time.  If you live close, I recommend getting carry out so you don't have to wait so long to taste the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Melt...I know I did. Into the chair and then into my car and I drove around in a carb comma for the rest of the damn day. The food is more than a Man V Food show, it's tasty, with attention to detail.  Not often you will see a \"craft soda\" section on a menu, and I urge all to try some. Boylan Birch Beer when great with my Build your own sammich. Which I did with great pride, my Turkey, avacado, jack chee, L&T with some red onion and honey mustard was OUTSTANDING.  No room for dessert, but I saw what they were dishing out, and I wish I had some room. OH and the fries were totally outstanding too!!"}
{"text":"large portions! good value for the price!  melty cheese with various stuffings. really thick bread.   i got the monte cristo. it was supposedly beer battered but it was surprisingly not oily at all! the jelly was delicious with the sandwich. the turkey and ham just tasted like regular processed meat.. eh  the fries and coleslaw were great accompaniments."}
{"text":"This place is nuts. Pierogis on a grilled cheese? Yes.  Chicken parmigiana on a grilled cheese? Done.  Your mother's meatloaf on a grilled cheese? Yup. Chicken and waffles, fried twinkies--you can't go wrong here!  We got seated right away and the staff was very kind. The restaurant itself is very fun, funky, and eclectic!"}
{"text":"Went in after a tattoo appointment. Sat at the bar rather than wait a half hour. Had the big popper which was excellent, and the blueberry lemonade which was just awful. The staff was for the most part aloof hence the lower rating.  I'll stick with the laid back Lakewood location this one was too stuck up for my liking."}
{"text":"A Cleveland institution!! One of my favorite dinner spots when I'm in Lakewood.I'm a heavily tattooed woman and get stared at at many restaurants. Not here. Most the staff is tattooed as well!! very refreshing. I feel comfortable when I go here. I am a vegetarian as well so the wide array of meatless options is wonderful!! Add a top notch beer selection and its a favorite for sure!!"}
{"text":"My daughters birthday so we stopped in before going downtown! Cheese wedges were perfect! Parmageodeon wow!!! No diet rods"}
{"text":"No way this place is a 4!  No way.  Went here yesterday.    Solid three but knocking it down for cleanliness.   Food: Completely average. It all had the same greasy taste.  Service is slow - 20 minutes for four people with a normal order on a night where the place is only half full.    Cleanliness: The young guy at the front, who I also saw expedite food at times, kept stroking his beard  and I didn't see him stop to wash his hands.  Gross.  Table was dirty when they sat us too.  Decor is fun though.  I visited another location a couple years ago.  It was cleaner.  Food experience was the same though."}
{"text":"Found this gem on a business trip to Mentor.  Melt was recommended to me by some of my local co-workers.  So, I wandered in here during dinner time.  Even though it was dinner time during the NBA playoffs, it was not crowded at all.  I got seated right away.  The service was great and our server was super nice about answering any questions that I had.  The decor was super cool.  I do not know how to explain it, but there was Christmas and Easter decoration, cool sign, etc.  Cool things to look at.   I was told by a lot of people that I should order the Monte Cristo sandwich.  I just could not get myself to order it thinking about the calories (It is a deep fried sandwich!!).  Lol, I know that sounds very bougie, but I could not get myself to order it.  So, I settled for a half of the philly cheesesteak and a cup of the tomato soup.  The food came out pretty quickly and I dug in.  I LOVED the sandwich.  The melted cheese into the sandwich was just right, the brisket was so tender, and the veggies were great.  I just thought there wasn't enough meat! But, tasty sandwich overall.  It does get very messy, so I ate some of it with my hand and the rest with a fork and knife.  I did not like the tomato soup as much.  I thought it would be a soup, but it was more like hot canned tomato.  I thought it was a little too thick and salty (and I love salty) for me.  I would definitely pass on the soup for something else.  Also, don't forget the dessert!  They do not have a dessert menu, but they have a few items that the server will tell you about.  I got the strawberry bread pudding.  AMAZING! It was very sweet, so I recommend sharing.    Overall, I had a great time at Melt and would come back again.  Maybe next time, I will be adventurous and get the Monte Cristo."}
{"text":"The bartender was so amazing, the food not so much! The buffalo chicken sandwich was just ok, I've had better! My fries were overcooked/extra crispy and could snap in half like a pencil. I won't be returning, I was very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Saw it on DDD and came to Cleveland for a visit and low and behold there is one right down the road from The family. This place is as good as it gets! Great sandwiches and great beer. I got the Double Dry Hopped Ruination IPA limited release and a Brooklyn 25th anniversary. Definitely get the Monte Cristo! You can't beat a deep fried sandwich with raspberry and an awesome beer!"}
{"text":"I was unsure if I would like the idea of a menu based on grilled cheese, but it  was a great experience. The menu had a lot of variety and my lunch was great. Portions are hugs and reasonably priced. Service was excellent. Melt was recommended to us by a number of locals."}
{"text":"Been a huge fan of melt since it first opened. I've been to both the Lakewood and east side location... both are well run. There was an issue with food and the manager came out within minutes, comped the problem dish and offered his most sincere apologies. Certainly won't hinder us from going back again and again. Every time we have out of town visitors, MELT is on the list!"}
{"text":"Every sandwich is good here (and I've tried many). Great vegan/gluten free options. We drive from Erie to eat here several times a year."}
{"text":"Great place! We were passing through the Cleveland area, and I asked a friend to recommend a fun place with good food and a good tap selection; Melt fit the bill perfectly!  The sandwiches are huge and yummy. We ordered the buffalo chicken, Monte Christo, and breakfast burger for the for of us, and took over a full sandwich home. The fries are tasty, but I can't comment on the cole slaw, as I dislike cole slaw...  There were 20 beers on tap - outstanding! The Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale and Stone Ale were delish.  Incredibly, the prices were very reasonable; the quantity and quality of food were excellent. Atmosphere was fun, and good service. I'd highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"I think this is a place that is worth trying at least one time whether it's this one or any of the other locations. I personally don't think I could go often.   Service was pretty good. I went for lunch on a Saturday with 3 other people. The place was about half full so we got seats right away. Our waiter did well. He was laid back, but he seemed to truly enjoy working there. Most of the employees had the hipster look. The decor is random with Christmas, Halloween, & Easter decorations on the walls. The menus are on old record album covers.  Now, on to the important part: the food. I didn't look at anything on the menu other than the grilled cheese since that's why they're famous. I got the Chicken & Waffles (battered chicken, waffle, sriracha butter, & pepper jack cheese with maple syrup for dipping). It was good but I was slightly disappointed. The sandwich, like all of their sandwiches, was gigantic. The bread is really thick and I think I would have preferred thinner slices of bread. The sriracha butter and pepper jack cheese implied it would be a little spicy. I definitely didn't taste anything spicy.  Dipping it in the maple syrup was good, but a little rich and made the sandwich extra messy. Now, the chicken and waffle were both fantastic and the cheese was melted to perfection. I only ate half of the sandwich and took the rest home which is saying something because I finish nearly everything at restaurants. The other 3 people ordered different sandwiches and all seemed to enjoy theirs although we all agreed that we would prefer less bread on the sandwiches.   This is not a solid 4 stars for me, more like 3.5 stars but I would recommend at least going one time to this place. To me, it's more of a novelty restaurant that's fun to go to every once in a while. I think I would get sick if I went more often. Maybe if I go again, I'll have to find something a little healthier."}
{"text":"Oh my god this place was amazing!One of the best sandwiches I've ever put into my mouth.The wait was a bit long (45 mins)and there is not a lot of waiting room there,but the place is very quaint and filled with plenty of tv's and Cleveland memorabilia on the wall(gave was a picture saying Indians World Series Champs 1997 doh!)I had a Hot Italian with grilled steak added,the waiter didn't write our order down and got everything right as well as always making sure our drinks were full.The sandwich?Heaven...that's all that can be said really.The fries were very good as well."}
{"text":"Coming from the dining mecca of Chicago, IL, my friends and I had high expectations for our first Melt experience. We were attending a wedding at the Embassy Suites down the block, so Melt was naturally our best choice for a noon lunch. We were not disappointed!   The decor here is so cool! I realize it's a chain, but other chains could take Melt's example and go nuts with their bar like Melt does. Constantly rotating beer, sandwich, and food specials are posted on chalkboards and the place is fun just to walk around and look at the tacky, hilarious decorations. Loved the touch of record album menus!   Service was great. The place was packed, but we were able to immediately sit at the bar. Our beautifully tattooed bartender was attentive, efficient, sweet, and cute! She let us sample many different beers before arriving at our final order. Also, she changed the t.v's to the Bears game, so props! Our food came just in time - not too soon or too late. We were in a bit of a rush, but didn't want to be forced out.   Finally, and most importantly, the food was the bomb dot com! I had the War Pig (Caribbean jerk pork belly, mango habenero salsa, plantains, slaw), my friend had the Parmageddon (one of us had to as we're Ukrainian and love pierogis), and my other friend had the Wake & Bake. After sampling all of them, there was just joy and full bellies. The ratio of ingredients was perfect and the chefs have such originality! Melt definitely blows their Chicago counterpart Cheesie's out of the water! The portion sizes at Melt are out of this world, and to think that my friend wanted to order an appetizer! The other half of my War Pig was still just as tasty at 4 a.m. following a plethora of Fireball shots at the wedding. If I'm ever in the vicinity of greater Cleveland, I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Carbon copy with twice the elbow room.  It's just like the one on Cedar, but easily twice the room.  We actually walked right in and got seated for dinner.  What can I say about Melt that hasn't already been said.  The slaw is devine, the fries are neer perfection, and the sandwiches; well i mean c'mon.  You better bring your appetite, you'll need a big one.  I recomend sharing if its your first time.  Just give me a shout if you're going, and I'll share any sandwich with you to break you in.  P.S.  Giant Hamm's billboard behind the bar...'nuff said."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I am a big Melt fan and have been to the Lakewood, University Heights and Independence locations on numerous occasions and tonight in Avon was far below the Melt standard.  After a 45 minute wait, my party of eight was put at split tables because \"that's all that was available.\"  Meanwhile, there were multiple open tables that could have been put together.  After another 45 minute wait for our food, what was delivered was subpar.  I get that kitchens can get in the weeds and service can get backed up but this was downright pathetic.  The Avon melt is a disservice to the Melt brand, hopefully they can turn it around soon or they've lost a customer."}
{"text":"Great sandwich-so many creative combinations it's hard to choose! Just have to keep coming back to try them all!!"}
{"text":"Great big sandwiches of you have a large appetite. You can pick from a breakfast, Italian, german sandwich whatever you want and the service is good also."}
{"text":"The portions  are massive  but some items aew available  in half sizw . There  are alot of toppings  too ! Veggies  were fresh . \" Good Buger \" was uhm ... Good !  Fun energetic  atmosphere ."}
{"text":"We came to Melt under the recommendation of a friend, while visiting Cleveland.  We were not disappointed!  The Monte Cristo was a great tasty dish and their fries were also awesome.  Make sure you come hungry to this place because all of their portions seem HUGE.  The service was super friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant thus far in Cleveland and that's saying a lot because I've had some bad ones.  Get there at 5pm (which I thought was early) to put our name in ahead of my party of 8 which would be arriving at 6:30. I was informed that because we had a large party it would be a 2 hour wait. RIDICULOUS but I read the reviews and that's why I got there 2 hours ahead of my party.  I had the intention of sitting at the bar and drinking until more from my party arrived but there wasn't a single seat that opened up at the bar that entire time. People apparently set up camp there as soon as they find a bar spot or a table and stay there the entire night.  Also no seats available in the standing area near the front door. SO I had to stand around in random locations near people's tables like an ass getting in everyone's way while I sipped my various not so great draft beers.  My party arrives one by one around 6:30. We eventually have enough in numbers to mount an assault on one of the seats near the waiting room. We took it with minimal losses. AND THERE WE SAT... forever... forever and ever and ever continuing to wait for a table.  Finally at 8:30 they get around to putting us at a table for 6 (note my party had 8 people in it which i told them at 5pm). They graciously offered to have us wait an additional hour or two for the proper sized table. We of course passed. All together a THREE AND A HALF HOUR WAIT PLUS CHANGE! Absolutely criminal.  Then for all that waiting we get served some average tasting cafe style sandwiches. Nothing groundbreaking and nowhere near the \"taste revalation\" many 5 star reviewers here claimed it was. I have a feeling some of these people are so starved for food by the time they get seated any food at all is worth it's weight in gold.   Waitress of course screwed up everyone's checks and took a good 20 minutes to sort everything out into the proper checks at the end.  To top things off my girlfriend gets sick and vomits as soon as we get home. Of course, I can't say if it was the food or not but the timing was very suspicious. She doesn't have the flu and felt much better after getting it out of her system.  I'd write the manager but I'm sure at a place like this he could give a rat's ass about anything that happens there.  Anyone that feels good about waiting that long for a sandwich is... um.... A MORON! Yeah you heard me. =)  10 thumbs down. WAY DOWN."}
{"text":"Unbelievable beer selection and good food. Definitely a great place to try!  I had the Classic Melt add onions and my wife had a Monte Cristo.  Both were very good."}
{"text":"Having been to the Lakewood location, I was expecting a more cozy decor. I understand they are renting in a newly built building, but the large open interior seemed so \"suburbia\" and noisy, rather than having a \"neighborhood pub\" feel.   We were told a half hour wait but soon found a table in the bar area. My burger was OK, I've had better; the chunky spicy cole slaw was quite good. He had the Cajun Chicken, it was good, but not spectacular. Next time we'll stick with the signature grilled cheese sandwiches. I do appreciate the extensive beer list, including several ciders to choose from."}
{"text":"The food is amazingly good and unique.  This place WOULD have five stars from me except for two things:  1) The front staff is unbelievably rude.  No matter who, no matter what time of day.   If you're running a business, leave the hipster 'tude at home, okay? 2) THE SERVICE IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN A RESTAURANT.  I have never, ever waited an HOUR from ordering to get my food.  I did at Melt.  My g/f and I returned there about three weeks ago, in the middle of a Saturday afternoon, to another hour-long wait just for a table.  Is this place ever NOT busy?    I know they are in demand but they need to either get bigger or get more servers or something.  Service this atrocious scares people away."}
{"text":"Woo!  My 100th Review!  Introducing, my new hit single...  [To the tune of the theme to \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\"]  Now this is a story all about how I took a little trip to Cleveland town. And I'd like to take a minute to tell you how I felt; I'll tell you how I enjoyed my night at a place that's called Melt.  Head east on Cedar Rd., up in C Heights, where the wait can run an hour even on weekday nights. So we chilled at the bar and enjoyed a few beers, getting set for the awesome feast that would soon be near. When a table was fresh, then we had a seat.  Rock music decorations on the walls were sweet. I got the chicken parm pesto and soup, tomato; our awesome server named Rebecca said, \"That's the way to go.\"  I savored every bite, half a sandwich was plenty.  With the fries and gooey cheese, it was all pretty heavy. No room for dessert and had to loosen my belt But I guess that's what happens when you walk out of Melt.  We.  Had.  Awe-some service by the sweet Rebecca with her killer looks, knowledge and sweet tattoos, brah! I left Cleveland happy with great memories  thanks to good friends and Melt, serving killer grilled cheese."}
{"text":"The food here is truly amazing!!!! They have a great variety of different grilled cheese sandwiches and sides. I had the grilled cheese with chicken and waffles (inside) sandwich. I was full after eating half the sandwich! Great customer service too! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place has such a good rating. I came to this restaurant expecting good food and good service with these ratings and I got the complete opposite. To start I went in early to get a table because there were 7 of us. So to cut the wait time down, I went early. It was still pretty empty and they said once half the party is there they can seat us. Ok no big deal. During the next 15 minutes people started coming in and in. Rather than holding aside the table I CAME IN EARLY TO GET, they just started seating everyone. There was another table of 7 who came in AFTER me. Our whole party was there and they weren't siting either party. After 45 minutes they finally sat....the other party!!!! We waited almost an hour! The staff just kept coming up and saying \"it's almost ready\".  I don't care if it's \"almost ready\". I came in early for a table. Why am I being seated after everyone who came in after me. And finally being sat, our waiter took about 10 minutes to show up. So we immediately ordered our room because one of my friends had to work. Tell me whose food came out LAST?! My friend who had to leave. And he knew that. My food was decent at best. The fries were good, yet rather cold, the pickle was good, but how do u go wrong with a pickle? I got the Parma Italy chicken sandwich and I'm pretty sure my chicken wasn't cooked all the way. It looked cooked, but since it was so thick, it had the raw chicken texture. I was so hungry after our 1.5 hour wait to eat I just ate half and threw the rest away and stuffed up on cold fries and a pickle. During my far from wonderful experience at melt, I watched the bus boy drop a container of napkins. The sprawled out all over the floor. So what do you think he did? He picked them up and started putting them RIGHT BACK IN THE CONTAINER!!!!! Napkins that have been all over the ground, are now in the container, for people to wipe on the faces and clean their hands with. GROSS!!!  I will NEVER return this is establishment and hopefully you don't have the same experience that I had. And PS. be careful when you're wiping your face with their napkins. They may have been all over the dirty floor"}
{"text":"Tried this place while staying overnight here, and wow, what a fun place! The silly decor is great and our server Pickles was friendly and great to talk to. I tried out the veg chili and the flavor was great. Then I ordered the Korean bbq sandwich. I got 1/4 of the way through and had to stop. Serving was huge! Was able to take it home for dinner. I just loved this place and hope I pass through town again so I can try another fancyshmancy grilled cheese! :)"}
{"text":"To those folks who complain about the wait and length of time to get your food--go sit at the Bar or hit Wendy's drive-thru.  This place is always busy and with good reason.  It's a really unique bar and grill.  So far I've had The Wake and Bacon, The Hot Italian and The Summer Chicken.  They are so simple but perfect grilled cheese sammich spins.  It's always hard to pick one but that's part of the fun.  Alas there's always home cut fries and homemade vinegar based slaw to join the selection of your choice!  On a side note...a few glasses of Kentucky Bourbon Beer on tap and Caspian's bartending really complete the Meltwich experience!"}
{"text":"Now that Melt has hit the south side, I've finally made my stop in...and it totally lives up to its reputation! Loved it! Only thing keeping me from giving five stars is the lack of a kids menu."}
{"text":"Huge portions. I couldn't finish the grilled cheese. Love the concept.  I think they should do a half sandwich concept with soup. That would be amazing. I had the Korean BBQ sandwich. I saw pictures for the burger one and was sad they didn't have it on the menu anymore.   Anywho, it was a really heavy sandwich but a great experience."}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant and didn't know what to pick due to how delicious they all sound/are. Trying something new is never a risk because it is a guarantee that it will be good. Cheers from your Alaskan customer, Melt. You did good. I love this place, definitely a must go. 5/5"}
{"text":"I truly love Melt. Next to the  amazing service and food the environment is just the best."}
{"text":"My gal and I stopped in here about four weeks ago for lunch.  We split a chicken salad and a Parmageddon sandwich.  I won't lie--it was all sinfully delicious and we enjoyed the experience thoroughly.  Fun atmosphere, good service and a very fresh and tasty meal.  However, 20 minutes later, we both felt as though we'd been punched in the gut.  This food goes down great, but comes back to haunt you a half hour later.  Unfortunately, we had to suffer through a two hour ballet recital in some serious gastrointestinal distress.  I didn't feel like we over-ate, but clearly the food was so rich that even just a little can do a number on your system.  I've heard the same story from others who have dined there.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't food poisoning.  It was just too much fried food for a healthy stomach to handle.  I would not recommend this place lightly.  If you plan on going, resist the temptation to keep eating.  Just have a few bites and see how you feel.  Otherwise, probably a fun place to sit at the bar and share an appetizer."}
{"text":"In a word... Amazing. The food was phenomenal and the service was spot on. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and checked on us frequently. Portion sizes are enormous. I would highly recommend getting half a sandwich. We got the hangover fries for an appetizer and then the monte Cristo/monster macaroni with soups for the meal. We both barely finished half our sandwiches.  My only complaint about this place is that there isn't one closer to my home."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is such a big deal. Its super crowded and we waited almost an hour just to sit at the bar. The sandwiches are super greasy and all the flavors meld together into a conglomerate of meat, cheese, bread, and fat that leaves you feeling icky after eating just half of one of their gigantic sandwiches. I don't get the hype, but maybe its an Ohio thing."}
{"text":"Good meal, but I fail to see the cult-like draw.  I knew what I was getting into, and was delighted to only have to wait for 15 minutes for a table during lunch.  I don't think I've ever seen a \"restaurant\" with such a high ratio bar seats to table seats, but that's not a positive or a negative, here.  Objectively, my Monte Cristo was really awesome.  I got a fried egg on it per my server's recommendation, and the sandwich took a good year off my life, which means it was a good sandwich.  The fries were fries - good thick fries, but nothing earth shattering.  The slaw, I really liked.  I like a good vinegary slaw, and this had a little spiciness to it, too - not \"heat\" but spice.  Really good!  Yes, they have a good beer selection, but I was surprised to see only one Great Lakes beer on draft. Surprised and disappointed.  Ultimately, while the tacky plastic figurines and DQ sign were charming, I failed to see Melt as anything other than a sandwich restaurant.  In that regard, it was great.  I'd have gone 4-stars maybe had my meal not been SO over the top.  The dessert menu looked awesome, but there was no way in hell.  Fried twinkies, reese's cup banana bread pudding, holy cow.  I wanted all of it.  Unfortunately, none of us got through more than half of our sandwiches.  4-5 stars, I reserve for a place where I leave completely overwhelmed with how wonderful the dining experience was.  To have to take half of my lunch and all of my dessert home just to be able to experience everything Melt had to offer, isn't my idea of a complete experience.  I'll try to stretch my stomach next time and be better prepared."}
{"text":"This place never fails me! I always tell people to go to melt if they never been to Cleveland! I come here often and surprisingly I always get veggie sandwiches  and brews. I know the grill cheese burgers and other sandwiches are delicious but the veggies sandwiches is legit! Always great to be at melt!"}
{"text":"Im changing my 2 stars to 5 stars. The five stars are for customer service. The general manager of Melt Bar and Grilled responded Immediately to my complaint and compensated me for my troubles. This makes me very happy. Melt Bar and Grilled  really cares about their customers. I will be returning for another meal and hopefully the food will be up to par to what it always usually is, great."}
{"text":"Not having the patience of saints to wait the alleged one hour or more to eat, we elected to visit Melt in Cleveland Hts. on a cold winter weekday afternoon around 3:30 to 4 PM.  We were seated immediately and a pleasant man came to our table with menus and  an introduction within 10 minutes of our being seated.  He was very  helpful with menu selection and suggestions.  Our meal was served within 25 minutes of our arrival. The crabcake appetizer was delicious,well worth trying.  My hubby had a blackened blue burger and I ordered a \"summer chicken\" sandwich.  Both were quite good but nothing to make the earth stop spinning.  Fries were delish but we did not like the cole slaw--seemed like just a bunch of dry, shredded cabbage.  It was fun to try Melt and see what all the fuss is about.  I can see where it would be a popular spot for the under 35 year old crowd.  We probably would return; I'd like to try one of the salads.  Our experience here was good but sorry,but there is no way I'd wait over 30 minutes for this place!"}
{"text":"Melt is the kind of restaurant that I would recommend to anyone traveling to Cleveland.  It is such a classical in the Cleveland area, but being a Cleveland native, it's not a restaurant that I go to more than once or twice a year - if that.  The food is great and the portions are on the outrageous side, but that's one of the reasons this restaurant is so popular.  If you like cheese, and who doesn't, you have to give this place a try.  If you're not a huge cheese fan, there are other options with no or less cheese.  Just this past weekend, I discovered the melt burger, which had surprisingly little cheese for it being made at this restaurant.  They also offer many options for people with restrictive diets."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food is always amazing. Don't believe the negative reviews about this place. They should just stick with fast food and free up the table space for people that love this place. It's worth the wait and price. Some of the best food around."}
{"text":"Great options for a vegetarian! And very filling. Ang was a delightful server. Too bad I don't live in the area, otherwise I would come back regularly. Seriously, so good and delicious!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had the Dude Abides and the Purple Parm. Delicious and huge! Fries were awesome as well"}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is good when people are tattoing thier bodies in order to get a small discount off their grilled cheese sandwich.  The problem is that everyone feels the same way which often results in 30-60 minutes waiting for a table.  They do a decent job of entertaining you with Santa Clause figures next to Halloween costumes in the decor, but is there any food in the world worth waiting an hour for? The sandwich selection is great, but the beer selection is even bettter - I believe there are at least 60 beers on the menu.   Unfortunately, the service is pretty crappy.  We sat at the bar & waited 15 minutes before anyone asked whether we wanted something to eat or drink.  Like many other restaurants, it all depends on what you want.  If you're starving hungry, put no importance on calories & don't care how you feel after you eat, check it out.  For roughly $25-$30 OTD, you can stuff yourself at least twice & enjoy nearly any beer you can imagine."}
{"text":"The Dude Abides - Really?  Did anyone actually take out the meatball and taste it?  My son said it was like a cheeseburger only harder to eat.  The Godfather was pretty good.  The bread with the Parmesan sprinkled on it made me think of the cafeteria food from grade school.  We both agreed that we should have gone to Chick-fil-a instead."}
{"text":"Cleveland does have great food, of course following the trail of great Yelp reviewed restaurants sure does stack the deck in terms of having great meals - and Melt Bar and Grill is no exception.    My kids got the melted bacon and cheese, and my oldest had a side of Pierogi's - very proud of his food diversity at a young age.  Anyway, these melted cheese sandwiches come out and are the size of their heads - a massive amount of food.  I had a small roasted garlic tomato soup,which was great, but had no idea that the sandwiches were that big.  My wife and I both had the Monte Cristo, because, well, those are hard to find in restaurants and especially good ones at that.  To me, rating a sandwich restaurant is dependent on how they make either a Monte Cristo or a Reuben.   Their Monte was great, but my wife and I should have just made one order and split it - well, next time we know."}
{"text":"Always great! Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. I enjoy the food every single time I visit. I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not the best vegan sandwich...the purple Parma never has enough sauce and it's dry. I don't know what kind of vegan cheese.  It sometimes is ok but overall not great. The amazing noodle salad was gross. The peanuts in the salad were just hunks of sugar and not enough sauce. I always keep ordering from there hoping it will be better but it's just a waste of money."}
{"text":"This place has a great, unique atmosphere and awesome food! Besides having a ton of delicious and HUGE-portioned grilled cheese combinations, Melt has some incredible appetizers and other small dishes too! My favorite would definitely have to be their tofu wings in their sweet BBQ sauce. Also , the service was great. If you're in Cleveland and you don't go to Melt, you're truly missing out!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch, and weren't feeling that hungry. I ordered their half Mac n cheese grilled cheese. Although it was good, in my opinion they're way overpriced and the food is not worth what your paying for. I personally believe a plain grilled cheese is better. I wouldnt return here."}
{"text":"I love Melt. I've been to the one in Independence several times when I lived down there and now that I am up in Cleveland Heights, just a few blocks from this location, I've ordered twice from here within a month. It's that good.   I recommend getting The Dude Abides with Lasagna. It's like $18 but totally worth it. You probably will only eat half."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great beer selection, fun atmosphere, and friendly staff. What more could you ask for?  The wait can get a little lengthy so I recommend grabbing a beer and stalking a bar stool. The bar is full service and first come, first serve."}
{"text":"Very interesting concept. Huge sandwiches and large portions of fries. Though I came for lunch and couldn't drink, I was impressed by the number of beers on tap. We ordered the Godfather and the Chicken and Waffle sandwich. Neither one amazed us, but that could just have been our personal preferences. This place was packed for lunch!  We each only ate half of our sandwich, because they are so big.  Hoping tonight's second half will be satisfying."}
{"text":"Great place to go! The wait time has drastically decreased since the other locations have opened. Having visited 3/4 locations, Lakewood by far has the most friendly, personable staff. Bartenders are very friendly and attentive. The building is small and cozy, so definitely stick to a small party. Don't expect a table if you show up with 7 or more people."}
{"text":"Just went with coworkers to the melt.  The food was good and we had a great server.  Problems came when we were given one bill for 17 people.  The manager needs to take a customer service class.  Most of us use debit or credit cards and carry very little cash.  The manager felt it was important to let us know that he was right and we had to pay one bill instead of working with us and accept individual payments.  Needless to say I won't be going back and I'll let everyone know how we were treated.  The manager cost The Melt a lot of future business!!!  I would have rated the manager at a -10 stars."}
{"text":"What is there to say about Melt that hasn't already been said?   I'll keep it simple and short.  Melt is phenomenal. A wonderful concept.  Large portions, amazing sandwiches, zingy cole-slaw, great sides, amazing atmosphere and decor, and solid service.   This is definitely one of the most famous restaurants in Lakewood and the Greater Cleveland area, and for a good reason. It works in every way!  The Lakewood location is by far still the best because of the intimate feel inside. The new locations are larger and lose that trendy feel to it, in my opinion.  Only drawback is the wait-times can be rough but it is 100% worth it. Call ahead and make a reservation. It's busy every night!"}
{"text":"Love Melt, both locations... Not good for my waistline, but great for my taste-buds. There is often a wait. Just head to the bar and check out the decor... A current legend of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Omgosh!! The food at this location was so saltyyyy!!! I ordered a sandwich and tofu soup. My mouth felt like I ate a block of salt. I haven't been to any other location since but I definitely don't recommend this one."}
{"text":"Typical new hipster joint, good selection of beer and wacky grilled cheeses; it's a fun place."}
{"text":"Bye bye, social interaction with the opposite sex. Don't plan on talking to any one you have romantic feelings until at least a week has passed from your encounter with Melt Bar and Grilled (even if I didn't fully appreciate the sandwiches, I definitely appreciated that pun!). I went to this establishment on a road trip with two friends a few years back. At the time, we were all very excited for this experience (seriously, who the hell doesn't want grilled cheese with a ton of shit on it?). I had the Yelp-adored Big Popper. However, I was dismayed by the overpowering jalapenos. I am a staunch supporter of the notion that if I'm picking off a key ingredient constantly from my sandwich, its just not the right ingredient for that sandwich. Now I like jalapenos as much as the next person, but there is a point where its too much and this was that situation. While I do wish I could go back and try the Monte Cristo, which one of my friends got and I sampled, I also believe that when I'm paying over 10 dollars for a sandwich, I should not feel terrible, fat, and greasy for eating only half of it. That's what fast food is for. Despite the negativity present in this review, I can't justify a two-star review because I really did like my friends' sandwiches, despite the fact that they also felt terribly after finishing them."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times, including the Lakewood location. The food is OK, yes you may not believe me, you saw this shit on Man vs. Food of course its good!! THEY HAVE NEAT STUFF ON THE WALLS! THE WAIT STAFF IS MADE UP OF COOL HIPSTERS! SO MANY BEARDS!  I was decidedly underwhelmed upon my first visit, but I got the deep fried sandwich with jalapeños, and at the time I just figured I shouldn't get an entire deep fried sandwich. My interim visits weren't memorable.  This most recent time I went (yesterday) was for a friends birthday, I happened to be in town and I wanted to take him out, he chose Melt.  When we walked in as they were seating us I whispered to the girl that it was his birthday \"we don't do anything for birthdays\" ok well I'd gladly pay you for a surprise dessert, do you fucking take money for desserts people order?! That is all I really wanted, actually I secretly go to restaurants to scam free things on people's birthdays its my only hobby aside from cat hoarding.  I got a salad and a cup of chili, I think they could pay a little more attention to the salads, it was iceberg with about 3 pieces of arugula mixed in, whatever its ruff age. It claimed to have sun dried tomatoes on it, but they were stewed tomatoes that had maybe been dried for a bit. I got cheddar on the salad (should've gotten blue) and it was clear that the cheese was for the grilled cheese, by all means yes use the same cheese but perhaps shred it in a way more suited to salads.  It was all really small pieces of cheese that ended up on the plate because they were too small for the fork.  Nit picky I know, but damn make the entire menu work.  So we are leisurely eating and getting caught up, mind you it is my friend's birthday and we haven't caught up in months.  Before I even touched my chili she brought us boxes for EVERYTHING. Slow. Your. Fucking. Roll. And let us eat.  As we were leaving I saw why she rushed us, there was a substantial wait for meat/cheese mediocrity.  So to all you poor souls waiting an hour or more to eat here go somewhere else and go here when you have time at 3 in the afternoon.   I'm not going to lie and say I'll never go back because everyone in the tri county area has a boner for this place and when I come into town we often just end up here. But I will probably just invest in alcohol."}
{"text":"I walked in. No line. However, it took several minutes to be acknowledged. Then once I sat at bar, again several minutes until anyone walking past me acknowledged me. It was loud and tacky decor, but I expected that. Food finally came. Fries were just eh. I ate about 2. I ordered the Dude Abides. Cheese was congealing already. Only 2 average sized meatballs on whole sandwich..and they were burnt and dry. I'm not super picky, but I was not impressed. If...and that's a big if...I go back..I will just be getting a simple grilled cheese. The bread was very good though."}
{"text":"Yes it's worth the wait, but seriously the wait is looooooooooong.  Delicious gourmet cheeses on thick cut  artisan breads. This isn't your kraft singles 1\" thick stuff.  Drinks are a bit pricey, IE hitachino ginger beer for $7 a pop. But if you can get around that then this place is perfect.  BTW, I tried the popper, it was delicious..."}
{"text":"This place is like \"The Emperors New Clothes\"!  All u get here is BREAD with little, poorly melted cheese...  Really?!  I can't believe anyone continues to eat here. Do you feel like you HAVE to to keep up with the hoi polloi?"}
{"text":"Simple concept with flair! Who doesn't like cheese, bread and beer?!   Melt uses the simple and comforting grilled cheese sandwich as the base of their inspiration and goes wild with different variations.  I echo others who note the long wait times, but the sandwiches are worth it. The fact that so many people are willing to wait for a table is a testament to how good this place is.   I can't wait for the East Side location to open up this fall!"}
{"text":"Typical Melt decor, vintage kitschy plastic holiday yard decorations, random beer signs, wood and brick.   Huge portions and good selection of beers."}
{"text":"Don't tell my wife, but I feel in love with another....great atmosphere with even better food. I had the Cleveland and it did not not disappoint. Portions are huge, so order the half or split a whole. Good luck and God's speed."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great service. Their menu is huge. And their sandwiches are even bigger! I got the monte Cristo and my husband got the chicken and waffels. Both were to die for! I will be coming back. A lot!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to pig out!! Order the Parmageddon and you won't be sorry...I mean, it's a grilled cheese with pierogies on it for crying out loud! The wait for a table can be long, depending on the day and time but it is well worth it. Fun atmosphere, great food!!!"}
{"text":"Melt is a really great concept located in the heart of Lakewood. Thick slices of bread surrounding ooey-gooey cheese in a mix of clever creations makes them a stand-out establishment. Who doesn't like a good cheesy sandwich? Their monthly special creations are usually outstanding; one I can recall immediately is the jalapeno popper sandwich; jalapenos, cheese, cream cheese, fried and served with blueberry preserves. It was really amazing.  Even with their recent expansion, Melt still has a pretty decent wait during busy times. I can handle the wait, what dampers the experience is that after waiting for 45 minutes it can still take another 45 minutes to get your food - which makes a work-day lunch stop very difficult. Maybe if my place of employment allowed me to take part in their beer selection (as one previous reviewer stated) it wouldn't bother me so much!"}
{"text":"I saw Melt on the Food Network and was still very impressed! By far the best place I have eaten since I moved here.  This is a great pick for ANYONE, they have something for every taste! I'm a vegetarian, and was very surprised and very happy at the choices on the menu. Over half the grilled cheese choices are vegetarian friendly, and they have multiple options for vegans! Meat lovers- eh they have stuff for you too of course.  I went here on a date for dinner and even though the place isn't fancy it's a great place to dress up to eat. I came in in heels, jeans and nice top and fit right in with the crowd. Great spot to drink- the beer selection is wide and again, there's truly something for everyone!  My date ordered the Godfather- which is a lasagna sandwich. He said it was one of the best sandwiches he's ever had! I ordered the Parmadeggon which was perogis and caramelized onions and was the greatest sandwich I've ever tasted. We got the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer and that's my only negative review for Melt because it wasn't up to my par when it came to dips.  Overall, this is a great choice for lunch or dinner! A great family or date spot."}
{"text":"I always make it a point to stop in here when I go to Cleveland. Our waiter was pretty helpful, and was happy to let us sample a few beers before making our choices. I like that you can customize your sandwich, I went with the club this time with no changes, it was good but it lacked something. It was the first time I left here wanting more. I look forward to returning and trying something new, again.  Coming here after running A Christmas Story run is always a nice reward."}
{"text":"It's a heaven for grilled cheese lovers and it's magical! Perhaps even more magical than any Apple products advertised. Cheesetacular selection and very generous portion. The sandwiches were cooked to perfection, fresh cut fries were devilishly delicious and coleslaw was wonderful. Service was terrific and beer selection was great. I'd recommend trying Big Popper, Gyro Melt, The Parmageddon, Northcoast Shores, El Diablo Burger.  The place gets pretty full quickly like rush hour in NYC subway so get there early! Otherwise your waiting could be somewhere from 1 hour to 2 hours. Overall, Melt is a great concept and is well executed. Yum, you will love the taste of melted cheese in your mouth. That sounds a bit dirty, eh?"}
{"text":"It's a good place to have a quick bite and to satisfy your cravings for comfort food. I had cleveland cheesesteak, kindergarten and Korean War pig and I would say that Korean War pig is favorite thus far. Servings are a big."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place. Definitely overrated. Our food was overcooked, dry, and greesy. No flavor. Just not good at all."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Melt Bar & Grilled and was pleasantly surprised. My last visit was very disappointing. The Monte Cristo that I ordered was scorched and very dry. My wife's entrée was also overcooked. After some years, and repeated encouragement from other Yelpers, I finally gave Melt a second try. I'm very happy I did.  For this visit I ordered the Mac and Cheese melt. This sandwich contains Mac and Cheese, battered, and deep fried with a layer of pepper jack cheese on top. Astoundingly good! Every bite was a piece of heaven. Delicious fresh bread, perfectly fried mac, and gooey cheesiness.  The accompanying fries were also delicious - seasoned well and fried crispy. A very satisfying meal.  Melt Bar & Grilled also has a decent beer menu covering a variety of styles. I ordered the Blackout Stout by Great Lakes and it hit the spot nicely.  Service was alright - nothing out of this world, but prompt and somewhat friendly.  I would recommend Melt to anyone based on this experience. Keep in mind that this was the location in Mentor, so I'm not sure how much location to location matters (our last visit was the original restaurant). We'll be back to the Mentor location for sure."}
{"text":"Leftover good burger.. Tonight I had the other half of my vegan burger ( good burger) and decided to throw it in the toaster oven so that the bread would stay crispy.     Great decision the sandwich held up to reheating. The bread wasn't soggy at all. As a matter of fact the sandwich soaked in all the different flavored of hummus feta and pepper jack cheese and was just as good if not better the second day. Just an update on my review since I had the sandwich two days in a row.happy customer."}
{"text":"I have been reading some of the reviews on here and I just laugh...I just watched this place on Food Paradise (cheese) and I have NEVER been here...YET :-D So give stars for what I saw...and will review once I bite into one of these awesome sammies. So even though this place doesnt need me to stick up for them, I need to say a few things for now...SERIOUSLY YOU ARE WAITING FOR GREAT FOOD FOR A REASON!!!!! Secondly,  stating the opinions about the staff like \"not displaying teamwork towards eachother\" YOUR NOT THE MANAGER THERE SO DONT WORRY ABOUT IT. YOU ARE GOING THERE TO EAT GOOD FOOD...FOOD CRITIC OR EMPLOYEE CRITIC?? YIKESSS....pointless dude....ok so of course you are paying for a good sammie but I am sure if ya want to add \"extras\" to it, it has the price listed by the ingredients list...YOU CHOOSE to add more toppings which means you spend more money!!! Ahhhaaa.  Dang I havent even been here yet and Im in love with this place!! Concerns about the long wait drives me crazzzyyy. That means to me this place is awesome and cant wait to eat!!! P.S the frozen eggplant comment was freakin hilllarious. You can see from every pic everything is FRESH....If ya dont know for sure about the eggplant or ya wanna argue about gluten free products, dont comment...its a waste of time to me and prob others. I WANT TO READ A FAIR FOOD REVIEW, NOT COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE WAIT, EMPLOYEES OR THE FAKE FROZEN FOODS...see ya soon Melt..til then...cheers :-D"}
{"text":"There's such a wide variety of grilled cheese sandwiches and so many of them sounded good. I got the Parma Italian one and it was great. The sandwiches are also huge which is great. Good atmosphere and service too."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about Melt and since I'm about to go o a dairy-free diet, said to myself the time is now. Prepare to WAIT. My boyfriend and I went on a rainy Tuesday night and thought it might not be that crowded--wrong! It was a nearly 1-hour wait, and took long to bring the food. I had the Parmageddon--potato pierogies, sauerkraut and cheese sandwich. The flavor was good, but it had almost no potatoes--way too much dough in the pierogis. I'm Polish so I know perogies--good flavor, too chewy. The coleslaw was so-so. My BF got the grilled veggie sandwich plus mushrooms and it was better than mine, very good indeed. I recommend only if you have lots of time and are big cheese fans. They do have vegan versions of most things."}
{"text":"Stopped for quick lunch as we were passing through Cleveland. It's more than a sandwich! Come hungry! Huge menu with many choices and combinations. I had a noodle salad that had more than a dozen fresh ingredients.  My husband had smokey Russian w/vodka sauerkraut and fries. Glad we went the extra 5 min off I90 instead of fast food."}
{"text":"So happy that they now offer Gluten Free bread! It's great to be able to eat there again! And it's nice to have the option to only order a half sandwich, which still comes with a ton of fries"}
{"text":"We went to Melt to experience something different, and let me tell you, we did. The wait was over an hour long and their wait seating area has approx 8 tables, why couldn't we have sat there? Very inadequate seating. When we were finally sat, which was not in the hour they promised it would be, we were sat at a dirty table with about 7 flies buzzing around. I thought to myself, okay someone left a door open. Not a big deal...yet. After we were sat, the waiter came over and did the usual drink thing. He did get 3/5 drinks right when he brought them back to our table. We also ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip. Choke is right on. It was overly peppered and took away from the spinach/artichoke flavor. After the waiter went missing for what seemed to be an hour (even though it was 20 mins, but we were hungry!) we were able to finally order. I have a lot of food allergies, so I asked not to have the slaw or the kraut, and of course that was fine. Between the 5 of us, we ordered 6 sandwiches, one was to split. Well, 35 mins later our food came out and my sandwich was completely wrong, our waiter only wrote down 5 of the sandwiches, and we still hadn't had any refills on our drinks. Needless to say, I wont be returning to Melt anytime soon. I was completely dissatisfied, and for $10.00 a sandwich, one would think the wait staff would be able to get an order right. Overall, one star. The place was decorated nicely!"}
{"text":"As always fantastic food. The atmosphere is very crowded and modern fueled, but you won't be disappointed in the end product. A must for any traveler or Cleveland explorer!"}
{"text":"Super good food and service. Lots of cheese so it's not for lactose intolerant or people watching their weight lol."}
{"text":"I end up coming here every time I go to Cleveland. Huge portions, as in, I never finish even half of what I've ordered. The wait around dinnertime has run between 15 - 30 minutes whenever I've gone, but the food is worth it. I had the Meatloaf Sandwich, and it was amazing.  I tried one of their seasonal drinks, which ended up being delicious. I'm not a fan of one of their ginger ales because it's ridiculously gingery and spicy, but their cream sodas and stuff are good.  Honestly, for the amount of food you get, it's actually one of the cheaper sit-down restaurants I've gone to and waiting is worth the deliciousness."}
{"text":"If you have food sensitivities, beware!! The menu boasts single-surface cooking for gluten-free options. I ordered a half-combo with a gluten-free sandwich. My lunch arrived on suspiciously non-gluten-free bread. After getting our drink order wrong (what's so difficult about a pitcher of water?) I was wary. Indeed, the waitress confirmed it was not gluten-free bread. She said she'd get a new one out for me and I could just eat this one in the mean time.  The salad had croutons on it and I'm fairly certain there were croutons crumbled on top of the soup and mixed with the cheese on top. So, despite their single surface claim, my entire meal had gluten in it and was inedible. In addition, another member of our party ordered a salad with dressing on the side. When the salad came, the dressing was mixed in. When the orderer said something, the server said \"well, that's not what I had written down.\" I understand this was mostly a case of a terrible server. The food was pretty unexciting, as far as food goes. I'll definitely be looking for other places to eat when I next visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"Huge drink selection, awesome food and the best part is you always have lunch for the next day with the amount of food they give!  A sandwich is around 10-12 dollars but worth every penny. Definately laid back environment nice spot for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I can't say much that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece. As a carnivore and a vegetarian I have stayed loyal. I converted my wife to a fan after 2 bad previous experiences. Almost every sandwich regardless of its ingredients can be made vegetarian and vegan. Gluten free menu available. Very fast and very casual with a HUGE beer and drink assortment. Craft beers and cocktails everywhere! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Different. cool atmosphere. But only white bread sandwiches?? Need more options.. The whiter the bread the sooner your dead. The ice tea, stay away swampwater"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, sandwiches were dry, cheese was so thin it was hard to find, ingredients seemed to have come from the deep freeze. Second time at this location, same experience. This time I was with a group of 7, my sandwich wasn't what I ordered (got celery slaw instead of blue cheese slaw on pot roast, blech), and no one in our group finished their food.   These were family and friends who were staying at my house and no one touched their leftovers either.  Just not good.  As for the comment below from the manager: I contacted Melt through their online form, waited two weeks and only then after no reply did I post this review. So until this review appeared on Yelp, the management had not been concerned."}
{"text":"Great food, good price, and great service. I had a burger with fries. The sandwich was more than you can eat in one sitting. One small point the sandwich had too much bread. We were seated quickly and the manager was at our table twice to make certain we had drinks and we were happy with the food.  Bottom line it was a great place for a sandwich but I would pass it by if you are on cholesterol medication."}
{"text":"Melt is one of my go to places. I'm vegan and I really appreciate the plethora of vegan options and complete transparency on the menu. I also enjoy a nice beer selection to go with my food. The atmosphere/decor is very cool too.   I enjoyed this place before I went vegan however every time I ate here I felt kind of gross after. Eating the vegan options does not do that to me and honestly I love this place so much more. My favorite is the Parma, Italy vegan with vegan chicken, no cheese, add sautéed mushrooms and a side of vegan ranch for dipping. The vegan ranch is so good. I'm not a fan of Daiya cheese and that is what they use.   I will continue to eat here and support businesses that provide excellent options for special diets. My only suggestion is that they get some new vegan cheese options which hopefully will happen with time."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and quick seating. Many large tvs which was perfect as we were watching Sunday afternoon NFL football. We were seated at the high tables close to bar which means the bar servers are responsible to refill drinks although we had an actual server. They did an excellent job too. My pet peeve is having to wait on a drink refill or have to ask the server. They did excellent job refilling before the cups were empty.  Great place to bring large groups or family. The Man vs. Food television show visited this location a few years back and attempted the challenge which is $36 and consists of 12 pieces of bread with tons of cheese and if you finish within the time requirement you receive a free mug and a shirt.  My boyfriend ordered the hamburger melt which was sky high. It was beautiful and absolutely huge.  I ordered the brush club which was also huge.  You have the option to order half serving or whole serving.  I ordered the whole and quite honestly couldn't even finish the half! But for $12.50 you fill your stomach and have plenty left over for a take home meal! Melts come with fries and pickle Spears upon request. I had asked my boyfriend to take me somewhere in Cleveland that was famous and he sure did!  Excellent atmosphere,  very friendly and up best wait staff, great prices and excellent tasting food. We will definitely return very soon! I do know they also have a location in Columbus as well for all my Columbus friends who would like to try this out without having to make the drive.  I learned that after the restaurant appeared on the food channel they brought the restaurant down to columbus as well. Most definitely recommend as you will not be disappointed!   My only issue was with the menu- so many options but the format was hard to read. Each selection on menu filling only one page..so many words so close together I literally had to point my finger as I read so I could be sure I was reading the correct sandwich and its contents."}
{"text":"Great food but a ridiculous wait if you go to the Lakewood location. Stick with Independence or Cleveland Heights and you are set."}
{"text":"Reason enough for me to question my move from Cleveland...I still moved, but every time I'm back i eat and drink here."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to check it out.  The menu was confusing, had to ask what the sandwiches come with (fries, slaw, salads)?  .....a platter includes a sandwich and fries only, cole slaw or salads are extra.  Other thing is people kept using the word \"kindergarten\" size  I assumed that was a child's plate, not every sandwich is offered 1/2 sized..  Wish our server had told us.  Two people can easily share a full sandwich. Some people like taking boxes home, I don't.  I would rather have room for desert, but not in this case....too large portions.  One nice thing, the server was very good about noticing we did not touch our perogi appetizer plate, it came to us cold.  Yes, I would visit again for breakfast or brunch, or a drink and appetizer but probably not for a dinner.  Also, their cole slaw while good is not the traditional creamy slaw with sauce; its more of a plain vinegar or something without any mayo type sauce.  Very loud in here, kind of goes with the high ceiling factory look decor."}
{"text":"My husband and I were thrilled to hear that Melt was coming to Avon. The staff that greeted us were pleasant and VERY friendly. It started our trip off well. Food is always  and this time was no exception! However, service is the reason for 3 stars. Our waitress, Melanie, seemed a tad hurried and only visited our table a few times. We spilled a full glass of water in the presence of the owner, his associate, and an employee. It was our blunder but no one offered assistance; it left us to mop it up with the thin napkins provided and water at our feet. Again, we did not EXPECT help...just surprised at the lack of attention. Melanie did pick up our soggy mountain of napkins, which we appreciated. If Lakewood is any indication of service, we are positive Avon will find their footing soon! We will be back."}
{"text":"If you're coming to Melt, you know what you're getting. A huge, greasy, unusual sandwich that's rich with bread, cheese, and other ingredients you might not think to put on a sandwich. I always LOL when people come here looking for healthy fare.  Melt is the obvious, true spot to include on your CLE bucket list of city-unique restaurants. No matter what, be prepared to wait a little. Both to be seated, and for your sandwhich. It'll be worth it!   I usually go with The Dude Abides, which is a giant meatball smothered with mozzarella. I also recently tried the Fried Green BLT. Piled high with huge, double green tomatos and pork belly. It was an interesting take on the BLT! If you're going to be stuck waiting on your sandwhich, try ordering from their extensive beer menu, or grab a craft soda. Melt is a place everyone should visit at least once!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Melt. I mean, if you're not, like, are you even from Cleveland? For those out-of-towners reading this review, Melt is a Cleveland institution of the ooeiest, gooeiest most unusual grilled cheeses you'll ever have. Whether a giant meatball on a sandwich or chicken and waffles, its all totally normal and awesome. I don't really think there's a bad thing you can order from the menu. I most recently tried the Monte Cristo, which would make even the heartiest of appetites satisfied after a few bites. Great batter, flavor and awesome berry preserves accompany it. My other go-to is The Dude Abides, which has that aforementioned giant delicious meatball.  The only reason I didn't give 5-stars is that the service has been consistently slow during my last few visits. On my last visit, water took 15 minutes to come, appetizer took almost 40 minutes and food came in an hour while the restaurant was half full during an off-time (yes, I was out in the freezing temperatures!). In the greater scheme of things, this is a first world problem, but it's just worth noting in case you're in a time crunch, only get an hour for lunch, etc.  On my way out, I did notice they had a stand-up apparatus collecting money for the Animal Protective League. I thought this was really nice. I think it says a lot about a popular business when they give back to the community. I dropped a few bucks in on my way out...supporting the APL is always a good idea."}
{"text":"Great Beer menu, great food (If your looking for healthy, this is not for you).  I love this place.  If your looking for a casual night with beer and sandwiches, this is for you.  Great selection of inventive sandwiches.  I tried the Gyro, thought it was fantastic, they put an interesting twist on all their sandwiches, even the ones you might think are commonplace."}
{"text":"Melt is the old Cleveland standby for a huge, greasy sandwich that is the ultimate hangover cure.  The Lakewood location is super reliable. When you get there, they actually have designated, non-metered spots you can park in, which I completely appreciate. This Melt in particular is pretty non-frills. Order your huge sandwich, get a beer, get in and out. They always seem to be a little understaffed, so I try to make my ordering decisions fast! I love The Dude Abides, which is a giant meatball mozzarella mess. They also have a legit selection of beers and old-school sodas that anyone will love. For summer, they also have a refreshing watermelon salad that's a nice break up from the carby food coma you'll get.  Be picky about when you go. Try to choose an \"off time\" that doesn't fall around normal lunch/dinner times and you'll be seated right away. Otherwise, there's been 1 hour+ waits. But hey, at least when you wait, they let you pick a hilarious nametag from their giant pumpkin. Paging Dr. Tobias Funke!"}
{"text":"I for one am sick of people bitching about Melt. The common complaints seem to be:  -- guh, I hate waiting for food  -- shyeah, it's only grilled cheese. I can make it at home and it's totally better.   First off, you can make it this good at home? THE FUCK YOU CAN. Everyone who's watched an episode of Good Eats now think they're a gourmet cook. Great.   Also, waiting? I went to a Max & Freaking Erma's last month and had to wait a half hour for a table during Saturday lunchtime. I waited 45 minutes at Melt today for a table during Saturday lunchtime. If that's asking too much for you, then get the hell outta here.   There seems to be a historically Cleveland mindset of hating places/people/businesses that somehow get too big for their britches. Oh, they were on the Travel Channel. Lame. Oh, they're getting press. Lamer. For Christ's sake, in any other city those would be actually good things. Every single person I've taken from out of town has raved about this place, from my latte-sipping friends in Seattle to my hipster douchebag pals from Brooklyn.   In the final analysis, Melt serves fantastic food, has a great waitstaff, a crapload of great beers on tap, and a distinct welcoming vibe. If that's not your thing, well, then it's your loss."}
{"text":"Yes, hell yes. Finally made it to this location in suburban-ish Cleveland/Seven Hills. I've been a Melt disciple for years, as the first location is within stumbling distance of my apartment in Lakewood. Hit this place around noon on a Saturday and waited about 10 minutes with my party of four. Service was fast and friendly and the food -- good god, the food. If you don't love amazing sandwiches and a shockingly large beer selection, than you and I will obviously never see eye-to-eye. GOOD DAY, SIR."}
{"text":"Been coming to Melt since the first week in opened its doors in 2006. Still fantastic anytime. I forgot that they do take-out, though! Even on a Saturday evening, they got our orders out within 20 minutes. Quick as hell. Great, now I'm going to gain 20 pounds."}
{"text":"The tomato soup is more marinara sauce than soup but it's great. Sandwiches are good but pricey."}
{"text":"I've had good grilled cheese, and I'm sad to say that Cleveland is a disappointment to the high standards I'm used to on the West Coast. Greasy, heavy, salty... but not in a good way. Flavor was bland considering how unhealthy the meal was. Dessert (cheesecake) was also a bland disappointment and chock full of empty calories as well. If you miss this restaurant, you're not missing anything."}
{"text":"How can you even decide what to order? Everything is awesome and super filling.  I recommend taking a week off of work, sitting down, ordering one of everything, and passing out into a Cleveland Coma where the Browns always win, the snow remains white, and the Free Stamp's ink never dries."}
{"text":"ok, waited so long to go there, and it was ok. love the concept, and fun, but food was just ok."}
{"text":"I will probably always think about going to melt for one reason . . . The Monte Cristo. This a hard to find classic sandwich that they do very well. But they deep fry it. Swiss, turkey, ham, on two thick slice of bread dropped into a fryer, dusted with powder sugar and served with a raspberry dipping sauce. It tasted like a county fair in a sandwich. Kinda like having a turkey leg, funnel cake and fried Swiss cheese on a stick in one convenient hand held bad for you food bomb. It hard for me to not order it time and time again.   Last night I order the chorizo and hash melt. Very flavorful, only order half and got the side featured. The side was kinda meh, sweet corn that quad some cheese on it, the hot sauce they had made it delish though. Service was attentive, outdoor seating available, Overly large beer list, seasonal features, creative menu, just like the place, can't think of anything wrong with it."}
{"text":"Melt is known to have fantastic sandwiches with a hole-in-the-wall taste.  The menu is comprised of multiple themed variations from the classic grilled cheese.  The first time I came here, I ordered the Monte Cristo due to my love for the classic Disneyland sandwich.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed in how doughy the sandwich was from the overkill of bread and breading.  As a result, I was initially disappointed by the restaurant but knew there had to be something more to this place.  But after coming back the second time, I was completely sold on Melt.  I ordered the summer chicken, which was amazing and completely redeemed the restaurant for me.  All of my friends also enjoyed their sandwiches and we had a hard time debating between complete food coma or putting down the second halves of our sandwiches.  The bottom line is that the sandwiches here are good and will definitely satisfy most tastes.  However, just be sure that you pick the right sandwich for you -- not everything here is going to satisfy everyone.  The wait is shorter than they tell you.  Case in point, we were told it'd be an hour and we ended up getting seated in 20 minutes.  There's also seating at the bar for anyone that's 21 and over.  Just be sure to avoid really busy mealtimes by going in relatively earlier or later."}
{"text":"I don't even live in Ohio and I have been here three times so far.  I have made the drive on every single visit to Cleveland even if it is 20 minutes or more out of my way.  I feel like this can be my entire review.  Really considering leaving that there.  Alright here goes.  Melt is simply fun.  When I walked in, the first thing I noticed was the decorations from multiple holidays up in the bar area.  This added to the nostalgia of ordering a grilled cheese and tomato soup with a root beer and goldfishes!  The menu has a million options and I get something different every time. One of my favorite parts is that you can order so many of the sandwiches vegan if you wish. My first time in, I ordered this barbecue thing with fake meat on it.  I know, that doesn't sound appealing and to me it wasn't really.  I am still fairly new to this vegetarian thing and I am not sure how I feel about meat substitutes yet.  It was okay, BUT, what my partner's Monte Cristo was AWESOME.  The tomato soup was absolutely the best ever.  You could actually taste the tomatoes!  So far, I have additionally tried the mac & cheese bites, the kindergarten, the purple parma, and a couple others.  I love that they have a ton of awesome craft beers and a handful of different root beers to try.  I love that they have a ton of sauces that you can add or use to dip.  The chili lime vinaigrette is a personal favorite.    The staff is awesome, attentive, and patient when I am indecisive.  This is great place to bring an out-of-towner when you want to show them around."}
{"text":"This is a very popular place, including being featured on the food network. I have been here 2 times and my advice is to get here early or make sure you have a lot of time to kill. The first time we waited almost 2 hours to eat.   Now for the food, the first time I forget the name but it was some kind of Italian and I really thought it was mediocre. I wasn't impressed for how long we waited. We recently went back and I got the Greek style sandwich and it was so fantastic. It definitely redeemed itself plus more. That was the best one we got and I really hope they keep it on the menu all the time because that is what I would get again hands down.   The coleslaw is...interesting. My husband and brother loved it and thought it was the best coleslaw ever. I on the other hand wasn't a big fan. It has no mayo, and it tastes like it has just vinegar on it but it's super crunchy. So it just depends what you like I guess.   The drink menu is great and I have never had bad service. The atmosphere is neat with all the stuff on the walls. I will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"We were very excited about this place after seeing it on Man vs Food & reading all the positive but unfortunately we were disappointed. I felt that firstly the sandwich had to much bread & not enough cheese, the meal was super unhealthy but lacked in flavour & was really bland for how unhealthy it was. The fries were the best part of the meal to be honest. Staff were frienly and meal was cheap enough but not worth the impact on the waistline & arteries!"}
{"text":"Another great location.  Had the buffalo tofu appetizer and the steak sandwich Melt.  Both were awesome.  Has some drank with grapefruit vodka and ginger and IT was awesome.  Usually its not something I dig but damn it was tasty.  Hope it stays on the menu.  Staff was all really fun, unike a lot of the new places popping up everyday.  Being a good server or bartender and actually engaging the paying customer is a lost art now.  My favorite part is all the amazing posters from Cleveland rock shows from years past.  I remember a lot of them when they happened.  Good times.  Sorry Indie buttrockers, country bumpkins and pop music putz's, these posters showcase bands that actually play music....with instruments.  Keep on keepin' on...."}
{"text":"Im changing my amount of stars based on the constanly worsening service at this location.  In Febuary they do different sandwiches every week and I risked thong season and tried three of the four sandwiches between take out/ eat in.  They were all sooo good but they are getting outragously expensive as well as the monthly drinks they have.   17 dollars for a take out sandwich?  Crack prices..   This last time I called it was 10:58 and the kid who answered the phone told me to literally call back in 2 minutes after I told him it was 2 minutes till!  THEN when I hang up and call again the girl who answeres tells me there going to be a 45 minute wait for 1 sandwich TO GO.  BUT I THOUGHT YOU DONT OPEN TILL 11?!  Aparently fancy office people who order the day prior through one of the lazy food delivery places get presidence over people who have been coming since day one and are in the frickin tattoo club??  Nice... I see where their loyalty lies.  Ive just been getting the feeling that the Melt crew (not all of em) have been getting the too-cool-for-school attitude and it sucks...  Aslo, if you get enough points in the Big Cheese Club they give you a credit for your next visit..on the receipt from this visit.  So, if you loose that or pitch the receipt your out 20 bux?  Aint nobody got time for that..."}
{"text":"Great service. The sandwiches were unique and delicious. Fun atmosphere and cool menus. They are printed on album covers. Loved it!"}
{"text":"We have a grilled cheese restaurant in Chicago.  I thought it was okay.  Now I know how wrong I was.    The two sandwiches I was lucky enough to try are the spinach pie and the big popper.  Let me begin with the big popper.  Oh my god.  Life changing.  Seriously.  Melty cheddar and cream cheeses and jalapenos in the middle of thick, fried bread.  I LOVE THIS SANDWICH.  The only negative was that it was so rich, I probably should not have had more than half.  Luckily, my husband and I split the two sandwiches, so I had no regrets.  The spinach pie was very good.  I thought the feta was of good quality, and got melty enough to qualify as a grilled cheese.  I also thought the vegetables were of good quality and were in good balance with one another.  We did not have to wait long to sit (20 minutes maybe), and it was about 9 pm on a Friday.  I thought the service was okay; they were a bit slow refilling drinks.  I also thought the beer list was incredible!  Multiple choices for lambics and sour ales.  I really could not have been happier."}
{"text":"We aren't from Cleveland originally so anytime we have family or friends visit, we always go to melt! It's a fun atmosphere and great food. I love that they now offer half of a sandwich. My husband always gets the special and he has loved every single one. I love the summer chicken, PB & Banana, parmageddon and Cuban war pig."}
{"text":"A multitude of options for grilled cheese and beer? I think they're on to something here. I tried the chorizo and potato grilled cheese and fell in LOVE. Next on my list is the Parmageddon filled with--you guessed it--perogies!"}
{"text":"My third different Melt location and a very good meal. I had the Bushwood Club and it was fantastic! My date had the Kindegartner, which was disappointing. I'm doing a low carb eating thing so I had the slaw instead of fries, and I highly recommend it. All things considered, it was great!"}
{"text":"The holy grail of grilled cheeses!  Cleveland  area, you have know idea of how lucky you are to have this place in your neighborhood!  This was my favorite restaurant  when we lived there and I still carve this 6 years later.  This location is in an old building  which was revitalized and decked out with alot of eclectic mix of things such as the collection of Christmas  yard art over the bar.  The menus are on old vinyl  albums and list the most delectable  sandwiches.  My favorite  was the Mushroom  Melt which featured caramelized port onions...yum!   The thick cut bread is buttery and crispy...and the cheese! Oh the cheese! All sandwiches  are served with fresh cut fries perfectly fried or you can get a delicious  side of sweet Cole slaw (not the mayo slaw).  Be prepared...the line to get in is long but I promise you it is so worth it!  I can't rave enough about this place!"}
{"text":"Melt bar and grille is amazing! Definitely not diet friendly, but who cares! The concept of the restaurant is that all the sandwiches are unique and extravagant twists on the grilled cheese sandwich. Sounds simple but the execution is exceptional.   Highly recommended for anyone tired of typical chain restaurant food, as this will blow you away! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had been to the melt before, but it was years ago and didn't want to write a review until it was fresh in my mind. So I went on New Year's Eve for lunch, and the wait was about 45 minutes, which I think is a pretty normal wait if you went for dinner. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations.   Anyway, we were seated and placed our orders. I got the Monte Cristo, which was absolutely amazing and gigantic, which I knew it would be. Our waiter was really great and prompt.   The sandwich itself was 5 stars, but I really wasn't a fan of the fries. They weren't really crispy, which would've been nice to have with a huge sandwich.   I recommend this to anyone and everyone who lives or visits the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Yum-O!!!   I have been in the Ohio area for a week now, and have been seriously disappointed with my food choices.   I tried Melt today, and fell in love!   The atmosphere is super cool! Love the fun decor.  The sandwiches were HUGE and delicious!   I could only eat half, so consider sharing if you aren't a huge water.  They have a rocking beer and drink list and they aim to please on the food.  I had the Cuban war Pig and it was excellent.  I am a sucker for anything with fried pickles though. I would love to see this concept in Denver, where j am from!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Melt? It opened while I was interning for Cleveland Magazine, & though I was smitten with the idea of it, I never had a chance to go before moving to Washington, D.C. - muuuuch to my dismay. Instead, I recommended Melt to every person I knew who was looking for a quirky restaurant in the Cleve, including five different friends who made trips there separately. Do you understand the depth of this? I recommended to FIVE PEOPLE a restaurant that I'd NEVER BEEN TO - & they all adored it, which of course only deepened my desire.  Now that I've moved back to Northeast Ohio, I was thrilled for the big day - my Melt Day. We didn't wait too long on a Wednesday night - about 20 minutes for a party of five. I had trouble, at first, deciding what to go with because everything sounded so delicious & so long-awaited. Ultimately, I went with the Chorizo and Potato Grilled Cheese, which had spicy mexican sausage, potato hash, sharp cheddar on thick white bread with a side of fries & a Franziskaner Hefeweisen to wash it down.  I was not disappointed. Melt pulled through for my taste buds - and how. I downed the entire sandwich & about half of the fries, then happily settled in with a bad case of the JAMS - \"just ate, must sleep.\" I sure do wish there'd been some leftovers, but who needs leftovers when you're that darn happy?  Melt, I love you. You were worth the wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I are celebrating our 1 year anniversary this coming Sunday, and decided to road trip to Cleveland! Bring the foodies that we are, we looked for the best place to eat in Cleveland and Melt came up.  We came in to great beer specials, and were extremely impressed with the service and menu. Sadly, we waited over an hr for our food BUT the manager Kevin was INCREDIBLE. He came to us before we went to him. Apologized for the wait and made our time here AMAZING  Kevin, thank you for everything! Our wait was definitely worth while! We can't wait to come back here, thanks to YOU (and the monte cristo. OMG) THANK YOU! HUGS FROM CHICAGO."}
{"text":"Okay so let me start of by saying that I am a melt addict, & I don't plan on getting help anytime soon. It's that good. The atmosphere is so cool & eclectic. The wait may be insane if you go during normal dinner or lunch hours but it is so worth it. Also you can avoid the wait by watching the side bar areas & grabbing a seat their when they become available. I've had an hour plus wait & then waited for a seat at the side bar, which was about a ten minute wait. I live in chagrin falls & will drive over to Cleveland heights whenever possible to grab a sandwich. & I am always bringing friends who have never been there. Melt is the best thing ever, hands down."}
{"text":"I'm from Michigan and for Valentines Day I planned a surprise trip for my boyfriend to road trip to Cleveland. We went to the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame and, after prior research , decided we should trust the Food Network and eat at Melt. To say the food was spectacular is an understatement. We started out with the Crab Cake appetizer which was phenomenal. Accompanied by garlic infused veggies, the cakes went great with the spicy sauce served up on the side. For dinner I got the \"Winter chicken\" sandwich, which I highly recommend with avocado. My boyfriend ordered the \"Fat City\" burger, only to be pleasantly surprised by the size of the sandwich. This monstrosity is not for the faint hearted. Topped with three meats including the burger itself and whatever cheeses and condiments you adore, one bite and you are glued.  If we are ever in the Cleveland area again, we will be coming back. Five stars well deserved."}
{"text":"Seriously, a-fucking-mazing grilled cheese.  I've been here a few times even though its a drive from my Canton area home town. But it is totally worth it.  Its two rooms; both with table, one with a bar and the other has a waiting area and the front desk. Nice bathrooms are downstairs. the decor it pretty cool. I like the old, hard plastic, light up lawn decorations lining the walls.  I usually have to wait at least a half hour (once 2 hours) but my fella and I grab a beer, pop-a-squat, and chat with the other hungry wait-ers. It gives you plenty of time to narrow down all the delicious sammies you want to eat. Their menus are on the back of old record sleeves; cute.  I've had the Porky Cheese (ham, bacon, swiss) and The Godfather (lasagna on a grilled cheese), both great! My boy and I like to switch half of our sandwiches to try both kinds because its so hard to pick just one! Their cream of mushroom soup is a super tasty side, if you're into that kind of thing. The only thing I'm not fond of is their peppery coleslaw but you can switch out sides.  Try the mixed drink specials, they're usually creative and tasty.   We had dessert once, which I believe was a special; maybe something like a chocolate graham cracker cheesecake. I don't remember exactly what it was, I do remember it being terribly good.   The staff is fine, I haven't had a standout great or a terrible waiter there.   Go, wait, enjoy."}
{"text":"First time here. An out of towner in for a hockey tournament. Great looking restaurant, clean and appealing. Staff is 5 star all the way. Ordered the Monte Cristo. Was below average compared to others I have had.  Too much breading to filler ratio. And the ham was more like lunch meat. Almost seemed deep fried as opposed to cooked on a skillet. Most people like quantity, I prefer quality.  I would definitely try the restaurant again and order something else."}
{"text":"This place has always been really good but the last 3 times I've ordered take out the quality has really gone down hill. They've forgotten things, such as fries. The next time the fries were cold as if they had been sitting out for awhile, not even somewhat warm. When we've gone to eat at the restaurant the service has been terrible, I don't know if management has changed or employees but this place has really gone down hill. I would no longer recommend it which is sad because it used to be so good."}
{"text":"A must stop when in Cleveland.  Amazingly large selection of grilled sandwiches and micro brewed beer.  I had a spicy chicken sandwich with avocado on it and it was simply awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome! A place I can take someone and not worry about coming off picky as they accommodate everyone's tastes. Fries were handcut and twice fried. Vegan cheese melted and tasted like the real thing. Great atmosphere and mood. Will be a fave anytime I head to Cleveland..."}
{"text":"I am a professional talker.  I make a living with words.   I was voted most talkative in high school.   I've been accused of having a big mouth.   I've even thought, \"Hey, I do have a big mouth!\"  Until I ate at Melt.   I would have to unhinge my jaw to fit their sandwiches in my mouth. That wouldn't be a bad thing.   I loved the feel of the place. Just a big kitschy mess of every holiday imaginable, old records, worn wood and neon. A great backdrop for gigantic sandwiches and beer. Our server, Julia, was full of energy and thrilled that it was our first time. She led us through the menu with great suggestions.   The menus are on old album covers that are donated by customers. Way cool.   We started with the Pierogis.  On the outside , smooth and flavorful potato filling on the inside, topped with a cabbage and onion kraut and sour cream. Perfection.   He had the Philly Steak Grilled Cheese. Oh man. Beef brisket, garlic mushrooms, sautéed onions and peppers, and rosemary onion aioli stacked on a provolone grilled cheese. I had a bite and immediately knew what I was ordering next visit.   I had the Monte Christo. One of my fav sandwiches and this did not disappoint.  Stacked with turkey and ham and two cheeses.  And then...slap me happy and poke me in the side...  ...they deep fried the whole thing!!   Let's say that again.  They deep fry the WHOLE sandwich...!!!!...in a light batter and then serve it with a side of berry preserves for dipping.   Sigh.   The fries on the side were crispy and seasoned well, the garlic pickles added a simple break from the heavy food.   Why 4 and not 5 stars?   Pricey. Even for huge sandwiches.  The pierogis were 2 pieces for $7.50. Hmmmm. I didn't mind the $7.50 if there were 4. But 2? I know what those things cost.   The sandwiches were $12.50 and $15.00. A little steep.   But, with that said...they are HUGE. You could easily get an appetizer and split a sandwich platter and walk away full.   Melt has won me over. Grilled cheese will never be the same."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Melt locations over the past few years including the original but this was my first time at this location. For 8 on a Saturday night I really didn't think we would get in very quickly and to be honest I wasn't really looking forward to it. I've gone so many times I was feeling burnt out. Plus you are paying $10-$15 or more for a glorified grilled cheese sandwich.  Don't get me wrong, they are amazing but at the end of the day it is still a grilled cheese at a premium.  To my surprise there were several seat options at the bar so we sat right away. I've always liked the decor at Melt being a Cleveland Fan. This location had the normal fare like vintage holiday light up yard decorations and Cleveland sports memorabilia.  All good stuff. The service was top notch and our bartender was very attentive even making beer suggestions and handing us several samples. He was talkative and really made you feel welcome.  I could hangout with this guy was the vibe I got.  I ordered the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken sandwich which ran me $13.50 for a full sandwich. I've not had it before.  I figure if I'm eating here again, I'm getting something different each time I come.  What an incredibly flavorful sandwich! The coleslaw and blue cheese were a great combo! I got really silly and dipped it in the provided ranch a few times which was equally good.  The fries were nice and fresh and I always get a side of sriracha ranch to dip them in.  We were in and out in under an hour and 10 minutes.   I wasn't looking forward to it on this day but in the end was glad we ended up here. Between the food, service and atmosphere it was a good evening and now a viable option for when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I like melt.  I liked it more when they had a burger on the menu.  I would say that the burger was probably the best thing on the menu.  I find this location is really easy to get a table / seated, and is usually pretty dead during the week.  Which is good and bad - good because there is no wait, bad because it makes the place feel kind of lame.    They have a great beer selection too - lots of TV's, the place could easily market itself as more of a bar too - but it doesn't."}
{"text":"Oh, Melt. I think I have not reviewed Melt yet because I cannot find the words. I love Melt. I'm vegan and still haven't tried everything I can eat here. That is really something! The new menu offers a lot of newly veganizable sandwiches. My favorite standby is the Mushroom Melt, but I also love Parmageddon and Backyard BBQ. They also have delicious hand cut fries and vinegar-based cole slaw (vegan slaw?!!? YAY!). The portions are huge, so be forewarned. Come ravenous or get a doggy bag.   The ONLY reason they lose a star is for the ridiculous wait times. I know everyone loves Melt for good reason, but even I don't want to wait 2 hours for the deliciousness. The few times I have withstood the wait times, staff has been super nice and fun, but of course there is a really long wait once you order too, so get there  and draw your name out of the pumpkin well before you are hungry. If you really want to experience Melt's dining area and bar (which is really cool!), I'd recommend coming when they open on a weekday.   But, definitely go. And if you're from the East Coast, please bring me back a vegan Parma, Italy. I've been meaning to try it :)"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal or complaint. If you like different this is your spot. One of my favorite places to eat. Carbs Carbs and more Carbs. Im not a huge French Fry lover but they have some of the best around town. The Purple Parma is delicious! Breaded eggplant, marinara, mozarella, grilled tomatoe, roasted garlic and romano. Perfection! Casual dining.  Servers are different. Not overly friendly but they do take good care of you."}
{"text":"Makes me miss the Midwest so much. I ordered the paramaggedon on my last visit, and it was absolutely fantastic. As of recent, melt has gained insane popularity, and why not? For the uninitiated, melt serves an insane amount of variations on the classic grilled cheese. For as busy as they have become, they seem to always carry a non pretentious attitude, and the environment is always welcoming and cozy. Along with the massive grilled cheese menu? Delicious sides, and buffalo wings. They also have a full bar. I don't know what more one could ask for."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! They have the best food and huge portions. Enough to share with another person. It is always crowded because it's so popular. A very cool atmosphere and a really good selection on beers.  Not the healthiest place to grab a bite but it doesn't hurt to indulge every once in awhile right? There is usually a long wait because they are so busy but that's my only complaint. The food is worth the long wait in my opinion. One of my favorite hometown spots!"}
{"text":"Great food and huge portions if you can stand the long wait as this place is uber popular."}
{"text":"I did not think it was possible to have a cheese hangover, or go through melted cheese withdrawals. If I could have injected the cheese from this place straight into my veins (just sayin') I would have.....this place was that good. Being that we are huge man v food fans, and lovers of all things cheese, we had to check this place out. We drove 2.5 hours from Pittsburgh, salivating the whole way there. As reported, the place was packed (it was Saturday afternoon), but we just kinda chilled and people watched while something became available at the bar. This place ha nifty artwork everywhere, super friendly staff an an overall great vibe. It's a pretty diverse crowd too. Finally got a seat and, in no time, our food! Check out The Big Popper- a double decker of deep fried Texas toast, like 5 diff cheeses and JALAPEÑOS!  Served with a heap of fresh cut fries and slaw. Every bite was magic. We will be making the drive again, until we have tried every variation on the menu."}
{"text":"Melt Bar and Grilled is a root in the Cleveland food scene. (No, no! The Root is just down the street! Where you go for coffee during your extensive wait at Melt. Yes, Melt is a bit overwaited, if you will.) How can you Not love a place like this? It's good and really cool and the only requirement for food is that it has cheese and it's between bread. And it looks like the only requirement to work here is that you're any form of frownless ruffian.   I got the Parmageddon, which is a sandwich made up of BREAD and POTATO PIEROGIS and with a massive side of FRIES. I have NO IDEA why I chose a meal full of nothing but carbs and starch the day after my huge Christmas food inhalation. (I know, I know! This is late! Sometimes I lack inspiration and a month later the review ends up looking like this.                )   Well, I see I'm running out of space..."}
{"text":"\"If I don't make it, I love you.\" - Text message sent to my pal Courtney C. while devouring a grilled cheese sandwich at Melt.  Heading to Melt after a few cocktails at the Porco Tiki Lounge was genius.  This place definitely gets busy - on a Saturday night, there was a 45 minute wait for a table, or you could sit at the bar.  We found the last two bar stools.    The most notable part of the decor at Melt is found in the ladies room.  Millions of \"HELLO...MY NAME IS...\" tags were stuck on the walls.  I used to hand these out at house parties in college and write dumb shit on them like \"Honey Smackz\" and \"Charles in Charge.\"  If you're a lady waiting to use the washroom, and it's taking awhile, it's probably because someone like me is drunk off their ass and trying to read every single nametag on the wall.  I learned about Melt watching \"Man vs. Food\" and have OBSESSED over this food challenge since then.  I'm not interested in competitive eating or winning food challenges, in fact I think most of them are really gross, but the idea of FOURTEEN cheeses on a single sandwich is quite possibly THE reason I decided we should stop in Cleveland on the way home from our Canadian road trip.  The variety of grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu will make it tough to decide.  I knew I couldn't finish the \"Challenge\" myself, although I really wanted to try it.  My husband & I decided we should share the challenge, but not actually compete.  For $30, we received a MASSIVE grilled cheese sandwich with three layers of bread and fourteen cheeses.  There was also what looked like a pound of fries, pickles, and cole slaw.    Shall I name them all?  Goat Provolone Mozzarella Cheddar Swiss Monterey Jack Bleu *possibly some kind of cream cheese* American?   OK I give up.  I honestly don't know every single cheese that was on the sandwich, but trust me when I say they all melted together fabulously.  We split the sandwich in two.  He finished his half.  I finished HALF of MY HALF.  The fries and cole slaw hardly went touched.  Did I mention we showed up quite drunk and starving?  Melt needs a location in Chicago.  It's a thousand times better than Cheesie's."}
{"text":"In on business from Cincinnati. Sat at bar service so so and there were plenty of them walking around. I think I got forgotten about several times...empty beer glass, had credit card out for a good 20 minutes and no one seemed to notice. Maybe it's free?! lol"}
{"text":"Melt is almost everything it has set out to be; except a grilled cheese restaurant. These are some mean sandwiches, don't get me wrong, but to call them grilled-cheeses seems just lazy. They're so much more, but this isn't always a great thing.   The kindergartener is one kick ass grilled cheese (don't forget to grab a cup of one of the best tomato bisque's I've had) but I think it's the only one that qualifies as a GC. The rest are some dramatically OVER-stuffed sandwiches. You're being gluttonous if you get through half your sammy and think you should finish off the plate. It's awfully nice of them to offer a salad for fry sub in though. Often while reading the menu I found myself thinking \"They were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.\" Thanks for that one Dr. Ian Malcolm.   All of this being said, I feel their most recent expansion to Lake County seems more than fitting."}
{"text":"I love Melt, but not this location.  Does that make any sense at all?  probably not, but I can say my past two experiences have been just ok.    The servers seem more apathetic and less enthusiastic about the food.  When asking for things, I almost feel like I'm bothering them, where as at the Lakewood location, the servers seem much more lively.  I'd gladly wait over an hour to have a pleasant dining experience than walk right in and sit down and feel unwelcome.  Not cool, Cleveland Heights Melt staff.  Even the food doesn't taste as good to me, which shouldn't be the case.  Maybe it's because every time I've been there, it's been a challenge to get my server to bring me more than one drink.  (service at the bar hasn't been much better...even with very few people at the bar eating or drinking)  I still love Melt, but I think I'm going to make the trek to the original location to get the great food and service that seem to be lacking in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"I have to upgrade my review to 5 stars. I've been back to Melt multiple times since my first review, and I love the place more and more every time I go there. I hope to be a regular at the new Cleveland Heights location, opening in February-ish. The wait is worth every second.   I really appreciate how vegetarian and vegan friendly Melt is. Every month they offer a vegetarian (if not vegan) version of their monthly special and are more than willing to accommodate special requests.   I'm a huge pumpkin fan and I'm totally loving their October drink feature - the pumpkin martini. It's like liquid pie!   If you're patient, not trying to eat out with absolutely all of your friends, and can be civil to the wait staff, please give the place a try. If not, stay at home so us Melt fans don't have to hear you gripe while we're all waiting for our delicious grub."}
{"text":"Delicious but overwhelming grilled cheese sandwiches like none you have had before - Jalapeño poppers and Purple (eggplant) Parma were the ones we tried. Both good but we took home half of each sandwich which is a lot of food to waste otherwise.  I would recommend they keep the same taste but reduce the quantity/calories.  Otherwise a good place to go with your friends if you plan to share sandwiches"}
{"text":"Ok so i love fish sandwiches and the Lake Erie Monster was a party in my tummy so yummy! Love the jalapeño sauce.  Fast service almost like they want u out really fast. This is my third time here and i always feel rushed. OK and the employees are extremely loud. Like they assume they are blending with the noise of the customers but you look around and no one is as loud."}
{"text":"Wonderful but definitely not a place to go to often. The food is overwhelmingly huge. Which is good. On occasion. We take guests who are new to the area here so we usually go twice a year. That is plenty.   My wife is gluten free which seems antithetical to a place that deals in sandwiches. However, they have gluten free bread you can get. We haven't gotten it though... My wife gets the Cuban sandwich and orders it without bread at all. So a delicious plate of meat. It's actually quite brilliant."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, Melt is a 5-star Cleveland area establishment. Yes, the wait is ridonkulous, but the beer and food makes it worth the wait. We turned up around 4:30pm on a Sunday and there was already 1.5-2 hour wait to be seated. Unwavering, we grabbed a drink at the bar (by the way, great beer selection!) and hovered around the bar stools, which are first-come, first-serve. We ended up snagging one in about 30 minutes.   I somehow wasn't prepared for the Melt experience. First of all, the menu is massive! With so many creative and innovative choices I can understand how someone would be completely overwhelmed and just order the Kindergarten (old school grilled cheese, no real frills). I ended up opting for the Northcoast Shores (crabcakes, garlic spinach, herbed cream cheese, & roasted red pepper). I made a slight change and substituted smoked gouda for the roasted red pepper, which I would highly recommend.  It was phenomenal, but literally enough food for 3 people. I felt like I didn't even make a dent! The crabcakes were massive and I think there must have been at least 3 of them in the massive sandwich slapped between two massive pieces of bread (Texas toast, perhaps?).   The ambiance was original, but didn't try too hard. It was sort of biker chic... if that's a thing. Old school holiday decorations are placed high above the masses representing  everything from Halloween and Easter, to Christmas. And, I must have lived in NYC too long, because I definitely felt like they could add more tables, despite others stating that the place can feel too crowded.    People really seem to love this place and feel the need to commemorate their experience (http://www.meltbarandgrilled.com/galleries/melt-tattoos/). I won't be getting a Melt tattoo anytime soon, but I would like to come back next time I make it to The Cleve!  (Note: things are big... (duh!) and hence, I used the word \"massive\" 4 times in this review. Ooops, make that 5.)"}
{"text":"Found this thru tv food app.  Was a good lunch spot and really enjoyed the patty melt.  My family enjoyed their meals too.  Portion size was good, even took some home."}
{"text":"Another great location serving delicious Melt sandwiches. I'm so glad that a location opened in Avon. Now I can make a Melt trip with every visit back home.   We came in as a family the day after Christmas for lunch. Lucky for us we arrived early and were able to get a table for six without a wait. The inside of the restaurant is much larger than the original location. This location has an industrial feel with a large, open dining area.   I ordered my go to Half Combo. The half of a Kindergarten (basic grilled cheese with choice of cheese) was cheesy and buttery with toasty bread. I loved it. The Vegetarian 4 Bean Chili was delicious with a great flavor. The House Salad is definitely not a basic salad. There are plenty of toppings like cheese, egg, tomato, and other vegetables. This is great for a salad. As if this wasn't enough, the combination also comes with a bag of goldfish crackers. This option is always a winner in my book.  My husband ordered the Fried Father which is fried lasagna grilled cheese. He loved this and said he would definitely order it again. The serving was huge like most of their items. The fries on the side were crispy and delicious.  Our waitress was great. She made sure we had water refills and took care in taking accurate orders. It was obvious that she knew the menu well. The waitress also checked in several times to see if we needed anything.   Just like the original location they aren't particularly fast with preparing orders. The wait isn't outrageous, but just long enough that you start wondering when the food will arrive."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and somehow have never written a review. I just can't justify giving them anything less than five stars. Since Melt started there have been restaurants trying to do the same thing that have opened, but Melt is still the best of the best when it comes to grilled cheese.   They have a nice variety of delicious sandwiches in addition to grilled cheese options.  I like that they have Cleveland staples like The Parmageddon (pierogis and kraut). I have to have my pierogis when I'm in Cleveland. The monthly specials are always interesting as well.  Even though it seems like a greasy, diet busting stop it does't have to be. They also offer many of the sandwiches in half sizes. The half sizes with fries would be plenty for most people. The only sandwich not offered in halves would be the monthly specials. I also love the Half Combo with is half of a Kindergarten (straifght up grilled cheese with choice of cheese), soup, and salad. As boring as it sounds the Kindergarten with cheddar is my favorite.   Seating can be tight during main meal times so I try to go at off times (think lunch at 11 or a meal in the middle of the day instead of dinner time. If main meal times aren't avoidable then rest assured that the wait will be worth it."}
{"text":"Food quality has suffered terribly. A staff member told me in private that they are very aware of this bring this to the managements' attention but are not listened to. When explaining our concerns to the manager, his parting words were \"ha, okay.\""}
{"text":"We had our first Melt experience yesterday. It was out of this world! First the ambiance caught my eye. The menu was in the form of an old vinyl record sleeve. A lot of kitschy things hanging from the walls but not in a TGIFridays sort of way. The staff was very friendly. The portions were MASSIVE and delicious! I ended up getting two meals out of one sandwich. The only downfall is that there aren't any locations in Illinois."}
{"text":"Beer selection (draft & bottle) is very good. The sandwiches are OK but not great. The cheeses are ordinary quality and as these are the stars of a grilled cheese restaurant.  I would have expected better. You don't get any bread choices so you will be eating thickly sliced Texas toast. Fries were OK but not crisp like I like them. All in all I would go back because of the beer selection and the sandwiches don't detract too much from the beer."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. We stumbled on this place while we were in Cleveland for a wedding and I'm really glad we did. We went to the wedding and were starving after so we went to get a little bite to eat. Little?...HA. The amount of food that you get for lunch is huge!! My wife got the buffalo chicken grilled cheese and I got the Philly cheese steak grilled cheese. We each split our sandwiches so we could try each others...Holy cow each were exceptional. Everything about the grilled cheese was perfect. The bread was super fresh and grilled perfectly and the filling was everything you look for in a grilled cheese sandwich, gooey, melty, flavorful goodness. The french fries were also perfectly cooked. I rounded out my low cal meal with a old school cream soda...please keep in mind that we had to go to the reception in an hour...so much for the light lunch. This place is way too good to not try everything on this menu. I'm slightly pissed that this place is six hours from me. If asked I would definitely drive the six hours to eat at this place again. Well done. My wife and I a few months later saw that Guy Fieri visited this place on triple D. I can see why. Go there and eat everything!!"}
{"text":"Give it it try! These grilled cheese sandwiches are huge and they come with a plate of fries or kettle chips. I tried the half macaroni grilled cheese with cheddar cheese and it was delicious. I was only able to eat half of my half of a sandwich because that's how filling these sandwiches are."}
{"text":"I had seen melt on various Food network and Travel channel shows and felt compeled to try a sandwich since I LOVE grilled cheese when I was in Cleveland last year. We had about an hour wait but in the mean time we were able to grab seats at the bar to enjoy some beverages before dining. They had a massive beer list, lots of craft selections on draft so that was great right off the bat. I ordered the Turkey reuben melt on Italian and added grilled onions. The swiss cheese was nicely melted and I loved a good turkey reuben too so this sandwich was amazing for me! The mound of fries that comes with the sandwich is a nice compliment as well. While the food was excellent the vibe was a little too hipsterish for me-kind of weird they don't call your real name when your party is ready to be seated too. Overall, I really enjoyed the food so if I'm ever craving a grilled cheese in Cleveland again, this will be my first stop!"}
{"text":"Food was OK. I had the turkey rueben - four slices of smoked turkey, one slice of cheese and an enormous amount of bread. I would say the food was on par with other bar food. The server we had was very cheerful and nice. We went for lunch and it wasn't overly busy but the service was very slow when waiting for our food and for our check. I might go back and try one more thing on the menu and see if I just hit the place on a bad day, as far as the service goes. If it was the same the second time I wouldn't go back, it just isn't that good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthy meal, come back another day. Melt is where you fulfill your greasy and cheesy (or vegan cheese!) indulgences.   It's eclectic. It's iconic. It's the flagship location. I like bringing my friends here because it's so different than what they find in their home cities. It's a Cleveland staple. I miss when the sandwiches used to come with both fries and coleslaw but I don't miss the two to three hour waits so I'll take the lack of coleslaw.   Melt has one of the best Moscow mules I've ever had! Very likely due to the fact they make their own ginger beer for it. Their rotating draft list is always full of great choices which I appreciate.   Sandwich-wise I always get either a 3 or 5 star experience for some reason. I can get the same sandwich and sometimes it's phenomenal and sometimes it's ehhhh. They have a rotating sandwich side and bread pudding every month to keep things interesting. My favorite sandwich used to have pizza rolls on it but they removed it from the menu years ago. I believe it was called the ninja turtle roll or something along those lines if you find it as a special!   Definitely worth a stop (especially if you had a heavy night of drinking) and you will more than likely have left overs which is always a win in my book."}
{"text":"Boooya!!  If you don't like Melt Bar and Grilled you probably don't like sandwiches period!  Korean War Pig (Korean BBQ glazed pulled pork, seared pork belly, kimchi slaw, pear onion cilantro relish, muenster cheese) is my fav!  The Lakewood location has a retro Centipede game that doesn't require quarters-Bonus!!"}
{"text":"Family in town visiting? Have they been to The Melt? Out of town colleagues in the office? Have they been to The Melt?  We take everyone here. Why? Because there's no other place like it. Because almost everyone loves it. Because we know they won't leave hungry. Because they have 36 taps!!!! 36 taps!!!! In fact, we may come here more for the bar than for the food these days.  So, my opinion of the melt has bobbed up and down a little in the last three years, but I think the real clincher is that we can't stay away. We keep coming back again and again. We love sitting at the bar and sampling some of their varied beers. Did I mention they have 36 taps?!?!   But... if you're not sure... you may not like the melt if you don't care for fried foods, or if you don't like beer. Actually, both of those can be mediated. They typically have a good vegetable plate and they have quite a selection of mixed drinks as well."}
{"text":"Imagine picking up a piece of toast.  Now, imagine dunking it into a huge vat of butter a few times, and maybe swirl it around a bit.  Now grill it with a piece of cheese until the cheese melts and oozes and slowly permeates into that fresh layer of butter.  Now, add a few toppings.  If your mouth waters after hearing that description, then melt is for you.  If you are experiencing a gag reflex from the thought of all that cholesterol, then steer clear.  Now, take that beautiful, extremely buttery piece of toast and toss it into the deep fryer for a few minutes.  That's the Monte Cristo.  I actually feel sorry for my friend for accidentally ordering that."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to review Melt because I always feel I haven't tried enough. Have I eaten enough weird grilled cheese to actually pass judgment? Have I tried enough cocktails and beer to rank its imbibe-ability? Have I actually experienced the gritty, greasy, wonderful reality that is the Melt?  Simply put, the Melt is my favorite place to take out-of-towners. It's nostalgic with the cartoons running constantly on the televisions, the softly glowing holiday characters lining the bar, and the retro albums backing the menus. The wait for a table is atrocious, but forgivable once you actually start ordering your hard cider or lavender mojito. And the food...   The Spinach Pie is one of my favorites (spinach and cream cheese, mmmm), partially because it's one of the lightest fare you get. The Kindergarten is classic and crunchy, the Westside Monte Cristo is sweet, cheesy and wonderful the next morning as a hangover reviver. The Roasted Vegetables is ok, but not good enough to have more than once. The North Coast Shores is simply fantastic.  I love you, Melt. Marry me. We can have a greasy, cheesy future together."}
{"text":"Unable to even review, they ran out of bread on Friday night at 9:00. Very disappointing, didn't even tell us when they sat us. Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Really cool inside of a bar and restaraunt . The local Cleveland stuff all over the walls was really cool to look at . The food was good and the happy hour appetizer menu is definitely worth it. I posted pics of the 5$ lasagna bites and the spicy chicken tenders which were amazing for only 5$. Big and spacious bar and the employees were very friendly . You can pick all sorts of crazy stuff to put on your sandwhich and even stuff to dip it in . All and all cool Cleveland place !!!"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting and I knew from watching The Food Network that I wanted to stop here for the Mighty Macaroni! It did not disappoint.  My 17 year-old son and his friend loved the place too. Very fun and neat decor!"}
{"text":"It is a very good thing that I live nowhere near this place.  My life expectancy would plummet dramatically.  The sandwich I had there was just so darn good no amount of reason, willpower or moderation would be able to keep me from eating here way too often.  After reading about this place here on Yelp and a few other sites I decided to give it a try.  Lucky for me, it was on a weekday so there was no wait.  I instantly liked the place based solely off of the classic arcade cabinet glass decorating the beer coolers.  (Note to self: find somewhere to buy those!)  First order of business was to get a beer (aided by the bartender that was a quick task to accomplish despite the large list) and start deciding what sandwich to try.  I knew that it was to be a grilled cheese, but even with that narrowing it down there was still a very lengthy list to read through.    I eventually decided on the Big Popper.  The bartender stated that this was a very good choice, but she did warn me about the raw jalapenos.  No problem, bring it on.  This thing was amazing.  By far miles away from any grilled cheese I've ever had.  Heck, this may just be the best sandwich I've ever had.  Chedder and cream cheese, fresh raw jalapeno slices on thick toast, battered and deep-fried, then dusted with powdered sugar and served with a berry compote dip.  I live in the Dallas area, home of the Texas State Fair, which every year has many people competing on who can create the best deep-fried item.  I've tried a few of the winners over the years, and none of them hold a candle to the Big Popper."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because it has been so hyped up, but I was woefully disappointed. The bread for the sandwiches was way too thick, and everything was just soaked in grease. I've gone to \"grown-up grilled cheese\" places before, and I enjoy a more even balance of filling-to-bread ratio. This place does not have that.  That being said, I still enjoyed the atmosphere and my sandwich was very filling. I just wish it hadn't been so overly greasy."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite, favorite place to eat! Last time I was in my waiter did Russian Poetry for us...in RUSSIAN! Then he continued to take the time to explain to us what the poem met. Not only is the food really good, but I really enjoy that their staff actually cares about their customers coming in, instead of worrying about the next table they get. Plus the portion size is more than enough, anyone who eats here, please prepare to take a box home and to have your taste buds and stomach satisfied!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been back to Melt in a very long while because we went vegan a few years ago and I AM SO STUPID!!!! I had no idea that Melt had so many vegan options!  It seems like half the menu can be made vegan!  Maybe it was always this way and before I was vegan I just didn't notice??  No idea, but I AM BACK! I had my new favorite pierogi,kraut and cheese stuffed sandwich and a December Special side: Kung Pao Brussel Sprouts!!! It doesn't matter if you don't like Brussel Sprouts because you will like these Brussel Sprouts.  The waitress said she couldn't stop eating them and me either!  Also ordered a cocktail: The Blob which comes with a sugar-cinnamon rim, vodka based and pink and it's the holidays, so perfect. I missed being here and so glad to be back!"}
{"text":"Yuk! Where are all these positive reviews coming from? The food was awful. No taste, no flavor, overcooked food and bitter salads wth awful dressing. Server was wonderful but that's all that was positive. Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Food looks pretty tasty.  Unfortunately, I'll never know for sure. This place, from a service standpoint, is garbage.  Walked in with the hubs (last summer) and granted it was busy. However, I've walked into many busy places (busier, in fact) and was at least acknowledged.   Tip for future restaurant owners: have a popular place with like 2 people working on a Saturday! Cool? Cool.  Had to ask where to sit after standing around for a few minutes. Was told, \"sit anywhere\". Mmk. Looked around and saw two chairs at the end of a long table against the wall.  So we sat next to people we didn't know. And we awkwardly sat. And sat. AND SAT.  No waitress. No waiter. No water. No order. No food. NO SQUAT.  Finally after 20 minutes of looking like complete (hungry) idiots, we simply got up and left and went elsewhere to eat. Oh and no one around us was getting served either, which was odd. What the hell was going on? Were we being punished? It was one of the most awkward experiences ever.  I may try the one in Mentor (MAY), but I'll never come back to this location.   Service is half the battle and they were defeated. Like playing Civilization V on Deity defeated."}
{"text":"This was one of the best restaurants that I found in Cleveland. Can we say adult grill cheese! Plus they server gluten free bread!   I was beyond happy to find a restaurant that served edible GF that doesn't taste like cardboard and allowed me to eat a childhood favorite once again. The staff was nice, and double checked on which sandwiches I could eat and couldn't eat due to ingredients that had gluten. Melt also had a full bar, including corn based Tito's Vodka.   There is additional parking for Melt in the back if you can't find parking off of Detroit."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed in this location, to be honest.  The atmosphere is more like a TGI Fridays than the original Melt location. The place wasn't even close to busy, and our service was seriously lacking in the attentiveness department.  The food was unique, Ill give you that. And the Cowabunga was unlike anything I've eaten before.  It had crazy amounts of pesto on it (which I loved)!"}
{"text":"Again, another Travel Channel find. Melt is a quaint little bar serving up 30 different kinds of grilled cheese and an equally impressive craft beer list to match.  Located in Cleveland, Ohio - the top floor contains two rooms, with a lower level with bathrooms. I expected it to be packed based on its Travel Channel appearance, but late night on a Saturday night, we have no problem getting in and finding a table. The staff is friendly and helpful - which is a must because 30 different kinds of grilled cheeses? For an indecisive foodie, this is a problem. Now, before you go all crazy on appetizers and sides, let me say - these aren't your Mom's grilled cheeses. They are huge and come jam packed. In addition, they come accompanied by two heaping portions of fresh cut fries and coleslaw. Each sandwich is around $8-10. Not bad considering the amount of food you get.   I opted for a Mushroom grilled cheese with tomato soup. Delicious, delicious, delicious. Thick slices of bread, and over flowing with mushrooms and cheesy goodness. The bowl of soup was quite large and refreshing since the grilled cheese is pretty rich. The fries seemed to be fresh cut potatoes and the coleslaw was nice, vinegary and light.  Best part? They had Predator playing on TV located above the bar shelf of old outdoor holiday decorations. I liked the ambience; it matched the laid back quirky simplicity of the menu.   I don't much else to day besides: Melt is a great bar. Good food, good beer, good people. What more could you want?  I will be going there again. After all.....I still have 29 more grilled cheeses to try."}
{"text":"A unique and flavorful spin on the simple classic the \"grilled cheese\". From the menus glued to the back of vintage vinyl record sleeves, to the tasty pairings of core warming comfort flavors, to the monster portions, Melt is a fun and soul warming spot. I particularly loved their tribute to The Big Lebowski with their \"The Dude Abides\" sandwich. A monster homemade meatball sandwich with all the trimmings. Being a true movie nerd myself I have to give props for that one, Abide!"}
{"text":"Always a good night at Melts. Food was great had the Monticristo. Had a couple of craft beers. Was a little disappointed the Seven Degrees of Kevin Bacon, was not available. Although staff said it will be there the last week of July. Any say road trip."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good!  I like the variety of grilled cheese sandwiches available.  Any grilled cheese aficionado will get a little weak in the knees at the possibilities.  Although I enjoyed it, I still enjoy throwing a few slices of wheat onto a pan with some American cheese and doing it myself from time to time.    It is definitely worth a try, and after consuming a few pounds of cheese you can come to your own conclusions!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that just opened a week before, this experience was awesome! Usually you'd expect some bumps in the road with a new place, but no bumps here. The space is awesome - clean, interesting decorations like the other locations, lots of fun local Avon stuff and plenty of room for the waiting area. The food was consistent with the other Melt places, which is to say A+!! My husband had the Dude Abides, I had the 5 bean chili and we were quite happy with both. The only thing that could have made my experience better, would have been to get a polka record menu. Maybe next time :)"}
{"text":"There's a similar restaurant in my area that I thought was pretty good, and the Melt blows that place out of the water.   I tried the BBQ pulled chicken sandwich with onion rings (yes, inside the sandwich) and sharp cheddar, and the massive sandwich came with a generous serving of fries and a big pickle.   Don't come here if you're on a diet. I'm not on one and I still felt kinda guilty about what I ate afterward. My sandwich was basically a mass of grease, cheese, fried batter, and meat. BUT its really good and definitely worth a visit. Delicious sandwiches, big portions, reasonable prices, cool vibe.  Tip: If you don't have a big appetite I recommend sharing one between two people (I was feeling pretty satisfied after finishing half the plate)."}
{"text":"Good food great staff. Good beer selection and huge portions of food. Most of the time I have left overs for another meal."}
{"text":"I wish I understood the hype behind this place. I just can't get behind it. I've tried three times and have been unimpressed. The employees are not friendly, by any means. The sandwiches are huge and so greasy... I personally do not enjoy having different meats and vegetables thrown onto my grilled cheese sandwiches, but I keep trying different sandwiches in the hopes that maybe I will find something I like. The wait time is always outrageous. Each time I've waited over an hour. They do have pretty good beer selections, so at least they have that going for them.   I feel like there are so many other unique restaurants in the cleveland area to try out before coming here. Plus the other restaurants will probably appreciate their paying customers. That's just my thought though."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant experience. Our server was great and informative - our food was delicious and generously prepared with attention to detail. It came out within 20 minutes of ordering, and it was actually quite packed.   I had the Cuban War Pig sandwich...the meat was moist and WELL seasoned, along with a well breaded and fried pickle. For fellow pork sandwich lovers, try this one!  I am trying the Korean War pig next time as it has Korean bbq sauce (yuuuuuuummm!!) update to follow!"}
{"text":"Just visited again 2 days ago. How this place doesn't have 5 stars from every reviewer is beyond me."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the advertised gluten free menu is a joke. They would not show me the guide the menu said they had and made suggestions by memory. Scared to get sick I stayed basic. Up charge for the bread, fine, but charging me again for a different side because they don't use a dedicated fryer is a rip.  I ended up with a $14 peanut butter sandwich and side of lettuce. Don't promote it if you are going to be difficult. It is hard enough to eat out with Celiacs."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! Always have half my food for leftovers. Portions are enormous. My favorites are the chicken parm or winter/summer chicken depending on the season!"}
{"text":"Chicago needs to step up its game and get a Melt. I wonder if they would franchise. MELT is seriously dreamy. So far I've only tried two of the sammies, but I think about them a lot even though I'm a couple states away. The Big Poppa was better than the pierogi one by a long shot. I would definitely get it again! I can't wait until December 18th when I'll be in the Cleve again and can introduce my belly to another Melt sandwich. I'll just have to remember to snack on something before because the wait is long!"}
{"text":"As you have probably heard, Melt Bar and Grilled is a must-do for first timers in Cleveland and anyone who loves cheesy, bad-for-you tasty food. I wouldn't say it is overrated at all, but I also would probably not make a special trip to go after having gone once. Don't get me wrong, it was good and I am very glad I went. I would recommend that anyone visiting tries it. For me, it would just be a special occasion type of meal. Yes, you will have to wait. For probably one of the most popular and well-known trendy restaurants in the area, it is extremely understandable. People that get mad at having to wait on a weekend are jerks anyway. it's clear that the staff is working hard to get you sat and serviced. We were quoted a one hour wait, arriving around 1pm on a Saturday. Hearing this, we got a \"name\" and decided to walk around the area for about 40 minutes. We walked to The Exchange and got some used cds at good prices, check that out for sure. When we returned, we were sat within about 15 minutes, so the quote was right on. Once sat, the service wasn't the most attentive or speedy in the world, but the server was clearly busy. He was friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious. I'm not going to lie. Yes, it's horrible for you, this is no surprise. I customized my sandwich and got the mushroom melt with sharp cheddar and added smoked turkey. My bf got the dude abides, which he enjoyed. Neither of us was crazy about the slaw- he doesn't like cabbage and I thought it had too much of a strong taste from the raw onions. Had I known I could substitute it, I would. In my opinion, the sandwiches shined over the fries, which were just all right.  Overall, I say check it out. Plan to wait, don't be a jerk about it when you do have to wait. Go crazy and make your own dream grilled cheese. I can't recommend the port onions enough- sweet and savory, they are a delicious addition. I only gave one less star because I see it as more of an attraction rather than a meal. It is a spectacle in itself and while I would go once and recommend it, I can't say for sure that I would have to return on my next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Incredibly awesome food and staff!!! Bring a large appetite because you will need it...."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese done right.  This placed has some of the coolest sandwiches I have ever seen.  Definitely get the TMNT if you can.  Cheesy greatness!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all.  It was extremely loud, crowded and overall a dismal experience.  Our server was non existent.  We had to flag her down from the other side of the room to get drink refills.  It took forever to get our food.  The Fries were too well done (borderline burnt) and the sandwiches were just OK.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"Went there with a large group on the recommendation of a friend. A definite Cleveland stop if in Cleveland. Menu was extensive and creative. Everyone in our party had a great time and great food."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend. We shared the pierogis. I got a salad with tomato garlic soup and the peanut butter and banana sandwich. The food is very rich here."}
{"text":"For grilled cheese lovers, this was the ultimate! All kinds of creative menu items, with the option to craft your own. Lots of beer on tap too!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here since I heard that this was \"the\" place I had to check out in Cleveland while I was there on business.  I was psyched to learn that they opened a Melt right by my hotel!  So I came here with a colleague on a Wednesday night around 8pm.  The place was packed, so instead of waiting for a table we sat at the bar.  Got a great local beer that was recommended by the bartender.  Also had their portabello melt, which was spectacular!  Homemade bread, coleslaw and fries.  Portions are HUGE.  Nom nom nom.  Only complaint would be the service was s-l-o-w (but very friendly).  And this place is noisy - but I wouldn't expect a menu like this to be in a cozy romantic spot.  Parking was super easy.  And they have outdoor seating if you don't mind a wait.  Will visit again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"After many years of waiting I finally got to eat at Melt for my first meal in 2017. I'm happy to say it lived up to the hype. I was impressed with the extensive choices and after about 15 minutes of perusing I finally was able to make my selection. I can recommend the Cuban with fried pickles. The mojo marinated pork on the sandwich was my favorite. Not too far outside downtown either."}
{"text":"I love grilled cheese so when I saw this place, I knew we needed to stop. The menus are awesome, pasted on the back of albums. So many variety of grilled cheese sandwiches to choose from, I eventually decided on the monte cristo. It was a great choice. The sandwich was so filling, the notion of attempting their grilled cheese challenge, which is 5lbs of food, seemed deliciously impossible. Might have to try it the next time I'm in town.  In addition to the grilled cheese, we had the hangover fries. Definitely different from the traditional bacon and cheese fries appetizers out there. Loved the egg on top and gravy. Service was good too. Since this place has been featured on Man vs Food, we knew we'd have to wait but the 25 minutes went by quickly. Our server was good and just seemed overall like a cool guy."}
{"text":"The Cleveland Cheese steak was amazing. The best sandwich I've had ANYWHERE. The sandwich was loaded with juicy beef brisket, mushrooms, onions and peppers. The sauce was sooo good. The fries were great and plentiful. The spinach artichoke dip was wonderful. Lots of spinach (not overly cheesy.) The chips were seasoned and dusted in Parmesan. Great flavor. This place would do amazing in Charlotte! Hint, hint!!"}
{"text":"My brother took me here for my birthday, and I enjoyed it. Had the Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich.  I would recommend this to anyone. Food is great, and employees are great."}
{"text":"This is simply the best. The best food, the best staff, and the best atmosphere you can find. It's like your in another dimension where you always feel at home and feel comfortable. I'm not sure if it's the fact that the people who work there always treat you like family, or because everything on the menu is so comforting. Either way, I drive 90 miles to enjoy the little world inside those walls and I'm always sad to leave. Try it out, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Anytime I'm in Cleveland, I have to stop at melt and get the peanut butter and banana grilled cheese with berry preserves. They have so many grilled cheese options, it's overwhelming. They also offer vegan and vegetarian alternatives for a majority of their sandwiches. The sandwiches are really big so if you tend to get full fast, you might want to plan on taking half home...they make a great late night snack. Their fries are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Their Monte Cristo sandwich had me craving the portion I took home as soon as I woke up the next morning.  I somehow made it to lunch, and it was almost as good reheated.  Bread was perhaps a bit thick on the MC.  We split a Peanut Butter and Jelly Bread Pudding amongst 5 people, which was for the best because we all left stuffed.  It was crumbly crunchy, but creamy with peanut butter and ice cream, and was one of the best desserts I've had in quite awhile.    I may have been the one scraping the plate."}
{"text":"It reminded me of California when I entered this place. The mushroom grill cheese sandwich and chilli was the bomb. They have a very good handcrafted beer menu too."}
{"text":"Glutinous heaven! Grilled cheese anything and everything. They also have the bestest fries in all of Cleveland. Salt and pepper and crispy... Perfection. Come hungry leave full, happy, and with left overs. They are always busy so if you don't want to wait get it to go."}
{"text":"Some friends tried this the other night.. I had a taste of a garlic toasted meat ball sub w/ deep fried cheese sticks, maraina sauce & some other tasty melted cheese's! Even cold  this was just the most amazing mound of yumness I had the pleasure of tasting! So, what happen's when u find a new treasure?? We come back.. Again & again"}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland over the holidays, I made it into Melt for dinner to celebrate my brother's birthday.  We called ahead last Friday night and were told the wait would be around an hour and forty five minutes to two hours for a table of eight.  Well, they weren't kidding.  I have been to the other location in Lakewood, and the wait there was just just as bad.  However, at the Lakewood location, they allow you to leave and come back when your table is ready.  At the Rockside location, they give you a nametag that you have to wear, and when you table is ready, they come find you based on the name tag.  A friend and I arrived early so that everyone else didn't have to wait the whole time.  We made our way up to the bar and grabbed a place to stand because an entire section of the bar was missing stools.  It's a good thing that Melt has an excellent selection of about thirty beers on tap, so you can drink a ton while you're waiting.  That way by the time you are actually seated, you're super happy and starving.  This has literally happened to me every single time I've gone to Melt.  Anyway, two hours later, our table was finally ready.  There was some table drama going on which the server definitely made obvious by the way she interacted with the host.  It was kind of unprofessional.  In general, I've been pretty disappointed by the service in Cleveland.  Maybe it's the lack of competition...I'm not quite sure.  Anyway, the service was fine once we got settled in.  I ordered the vegan Mushroom Melt, which is a favorite of mine, and my friend ordered the Backyard BBQ for us to swap.  I love the Mushroom Melt, but the Backyard BBQ really stole the show.  The only thing it was lacking way a little more BBQ sauce.  I love BBQ sauce and wanted it to be dripping.  Three other people at our table ordered the Purple Parma but weren't told until after ordering that they were out of it.  That was probably disappointing for the others in our party.  The fries that come on the side taste fresh cut and are excellent with some malt vinegar and lots of ketchup.  While I don't think anywhere is worth a two hour, Melt has a part of my heart, and I try to go there at least once a year during my visits back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday, with my boss. Decided on this place because I had been to the melt in Lakewood a few times and it was awesome. The one here on rockside is far from that, it's a sterilized boring version of the original.  The food was cold by the time it got to us nearly 25 minutes after we ordered, and the server seemed like he went on a smoke break at the start of our meal and never came back.  I'll stick to the original"}
{"text":"I want to love this place. This is all opinion based, and I should tell you off the bat, of all the places I've dragged my husband to for grilled cheese, this was one of his favorites. But me? Nah, I'll pass the drive from Akron (or Central PA, since really, that's where I drove in from) and kep going to my other grilled cheese staples.  So this place is really popular. Like it's got an hour and a half wait and is packed to the max in the waiting area right at 5PM popular. I've never been somewhere and dealt with over an hour wait, ever. Wait, actually once, but there were other bars and restaurants around and they called my cell to tell me to come to my table. Here, you have to wait around the restaurant. I suggest getting a beer and stalking the bar and eating there. Also, come as like a group of 2-3. Coming as a group of 5 was not smart on my part - we got smashed into a 4 person table which made eating fun and had to wait (even though 2 of us got seats at the bar.)  Their beer selection is pretty darn great. While there, I got an Ace pear cider which I haven't seen on draft in Ohio yet, so that was a nice surprise. Bar was crazy busy as well though, so there were constantly people kind of just standing on top of us.  The place is really decorated and bright - it's got this super hipster feel to it. The way they reserve tables is by giving you a name tag of whatever fictional character they like. We got 'Ron Swanson.'   The menus are all printed on old records, which is a pretty cute idea, but made for a crowded table as the giant squares took up a lot of room. The menu is fairly simple - grilled cheese with tons of things stuffed inside. Everything from just cheese to stuffed with BBQ chicken or pierogies. We ended up trying the buffalo tofu as an appetizer, a grilled cheese with cheddar, bbq pulled pork (you have to add the BBQ sauce to the pork), mashed potatoes and onion straws, and another grilled cheese - the specialty at the time which was a grilled mac and cheese sandwich with bacon and caramel port onions added.  The plates come with french fries and 'sweet slaw.' I asked for no slaw, yet it still came. My husband's didn't and he got extra fries - I was jealous. As was everyone else because not a single one of the 5 of us liked the slaw - even the guy who normally likes coleslaw. The fries are good - thick cut with seasoning, although one spice in their seasoning is still really throwing me off. The grilled cheeses are huge - and I physically could only eat half. They only have one type of bread which actually knocks it down a bit for me - it's really thick and kind of rough and cut my mouth up. Not a fan of that. The toppings inside were all pretty darn good - the pulled pork mashed potato mix up I created was better than the grilled cheese one. Those caramel port onions are REALLY sweet and will almost over power anything you put them on, so only get them if you are getting something else that is as strongly flavored.   Service was pretty decent. You had to feel bad for our poor waitress going in between so many tables. But out plates and glasses kept stacking up, and with 5 people at a 4 person table, we needed all the room.  My husband chose to end with fried twinkes as a dessert. They are not fried twinkies - they are just fried cream puffs. And bad cream puffs at that. The dough was too tough and the cream was over cooked and separating so it was almost curdled and just really gross. Totally got knocked down a star for the terribleness alone.  In the end, was it good food? Yes. Was it the best grilled cheese I have ever had? No. Was it worth the drive? For one time, sure. But never again. In my search for the yummiest grilled cheese place, this just wasn't it. Cincinnati still has you beat on this one, Cleveland."}
{"text":"If you are worried about a diet, probably skip out... It was my first time in Ohio and was told this place was a must eat.  They were correct! This place was sooo good.  We started out with the hangover fries which were ridiculously good.  I got the buffalo chicken melt, which I thought would be more grilled cheesey (?) but was delicious none the less. Pretty hipster vibe overall, but really enjoyed it. Will make sure to head back there next time we are in Ohio!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't alread been said?!! This place is first of all, a great idea for a restaurant and secondly, absolutely delicious! I had the big pooper of course which was as good as I had dreamed it would be. It is essentially a jalapeno popper in sandwich form and come is 3 large parts. It is deep fried but does not seem greasy at all. It also comes dusted with powdered sugar and with a side of raspberry preserves. This sounded weird at first but goes SO well with the spiciness of the fresh jalapenos.   As an app we got the buffalo chicken chowder that was served with Gold Fish cheese crackers. This soup was outstanding! I could have eaten a bucket of it! Make sure to get some, even if just to share before your gargantuan sandwich gets there.   My husband had the special which was some sort of pulled pork called the Big Pig or something. It was amazing as well. This place is not just unique but extremely tasty and well thought out. Love the restaurant too, very eclective decor and crowd. DON\"T MISS OUT!"}
{"text":"I am upset. Gastrointestinal-ly upset, that is. So now I am in that precarious situation where I have to ask myself: do I give  them a low score for the pain and suffering? Or a high score because I honestly loved my food... My butt has got me feeling vindictive."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm not going to even waste typing energy to write a detailed review. Everyone else has pretty much covered why this place is so great, and I agree wholeheartedly. I can't believe it took me so long to even bother coming out to try it out. I'VE WASTED SO MUCH TIME NOT EATING HERE UNTIL NOW!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I forgot to yelp about this place.  I go there once a week, lol.    I am so glad for 2 things, the expanded seating area and the lower wait time since they've opened their 2nd location in Cleveland Heights.    The place itself has probably some of the most charming scenery I have ever witnessed in a pub/diner.  I love the sandwiches, I always have a 2nd helping to bring home and enjoy later.  The fries are some of the best I've enjoyed as well.  This place is also a beer drinker's heaven.  I never have seen such an expansive selection.  I'm eager to try them all.  The staff is nice and normal.  No one is ever snotty or mean, rather they are quite endearing.  I never have had bad service.  Any time friends come in from out of town, I take them there and they fall in love.  This place I would have to say is the crown jewel of Cleveland...simple, delicious, cozy.  It's not quiet in there by any means, but I don't mind it, I think it helps set the mood to enjoy a good melt sandwich and talk overly loud with your friends!  :)"}
{"text":"Melt is the perfect hangover cure!  I went here on a Sunday afternoon after being snowed in on Sat night and going out to a Cav's game and out afterwards.   They have a great bloody mary, amazing grilled cheese, good fries and several really good beers on tap that cleared my hangover right up!  Being from Texas, I couldn't say no to the \"Big Popper\" grilled cheese that was filled with jalapenos, cream cheese, and cheddar, then deep fried and served with a raspberry dipping sauce.  The fries are fresh cut and hot out of the grease.  There were some really good and unique beers on tap that I had never heard of before....and that is saying a lot actually.  The only knock I have on the place is that it was way, way packed for the lunch crowd.  I could not get a table and I could barely squeeze in at the bar.  The girl I sat next to at the bar was really friendly and she said it's always packed for dinner and lunch ever since Adam Richman did his man vs food episode here.  Apparently people will attempt the Melt grilled cheese challenge (that huge grilled cheese with like 15 different cheeses on it) and will yak on the bar or table.  Gross...  Any way, it's a really unique and cool place with a great atmosphere.  I can't wait to go back and try a different grilled cheese.  There are so many different choices to choose from."}
{"text":"Nice bartender, horrible management. Extra star for the bartender, not his fault. Visiting out of state. Last time I came in April it was amazing. Second time here I'm very disappointed. It took an hour to get food and then it was cold. Clearly food had been sitting for at least 45 minutes with mayo on the sandwich. They replaced it with soup. They didn't make us pay for the food, but had to pay for the drinks. Bad management. Guys next to us also have cold food and hard cheese. It's called the melt, right?"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love melt and will continue to go there. However, I'm done ordering sandwiches to go. 3 out of my last 4 orders have been wrong. If I was getting to-go orders at a busy time I really wouldn't care but when I'm picking up a sandwich at 4p.m. and they can't get the order right, that's a bit ridiculous imo.   Still would recommend melt to everyone I know but only for dine-in."}
{"text":"Big Popper made my week.  It's definitely big - I had some later for dinner, and still later for the next day's breakfast - and it's one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten.  This place definitely needs to reconsider the way they use their space.  That huge waiting salon could just as easily be a seated eating area.  If they like, they can still call it a waiting salon, just let me eat while I wait for my bill.  If you know what a real pierogi is, don't order the Melt version.  It's not even close to being a pierogi, and will kind of make you a little bit sad inside that they call it so.  I mean, you'll recover because of the tastiness yet to come, but the Melt pierogi is just not that recommendable under any name.  You'd do better to turn your attention to the Ultimate Fries."}
{"text":"While traveling to Ohio to visit family, the cousins took me to this awesome spot.  When I think about it I haven't had better tasting bar food... probably ever.  Not to mention, a great selection of beer and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to trying the new Melt in Avon.  We waited a rather long time for our food and when we finally got it, both my soup and grilled cheese were lukewarm.  Not nearly as good as the Lakewood and Independence locations... hoping they improve with time."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way from Chicago to Boston in a day.   I love grilled cheese but I'm a lactard so I wasn't sure how this place was going to treat me.   I was awestruck when I found out that there are tons of options for vegetarians and vegans.   We did have to wait about 30 minutes during lunch time but it was so worth the wait. We'd spent the weekend hitting up places in Chicago that had been featured on TV shows or had gotten rave reviews and this was the absolute best of the weekend.  Our waitress was super friendly and kept my water topped off the whole time (which was a little dangerous because we still had 10 more hours to drive). I got the vegan pig roast which was the monthly special and it ruled. The potato salad was so good as was everything else on the plate. The other two in my group agreed that this was probably the best thing we'd gotten.  If they'd let me open one in Boston I'd totally do it."}
{"text":"So after a long day at work I'm looking for somewhere nice to take it easy and enjoy a good meal. A friend suggested Melt, so we're off to see what this place is about!      Melt sits on the corner with a nice frontage greeting the passerby, beckoning one to come inside and experience wonder. Walcing inside, however, I'm surrounded by plastic holiday decorations, lighting along the wall as if it's the Grizwold's yard and detracting from a rather nice mural on the back wall.      I wait a few minutes to get noticed, and the hostess seats me near the window. The decor continues in the same loud manner throughout the place, in some places it makes sense, in some places it's attractive, in others, just garrish.      The menu is straightfoward, nice selection of inebrients for most any palatte, but I'm here for the sandwich. The sandwiches are variatio s on the classic grilled cheese, other ingredients added to make their signature eats. I go with the wake and bacon, eggs and bacon and grilled cheese on texas toast.      I start with a couple pierogies, and find them to be rather plain. Rather disappointing for a Cleveland bar to have such plain pierogie.      Moving on to the sandwich, I find my meal much improved. The cheese selection fits the eggs and bacon well, the eggs are cooked to order and the bacon is savory and crisp. The texas toast has a nice crisp grilled exterior, but is still nice and buttery, well done.      For the price point, I thought the sandwich was great, the appetizer sub par, and the service was meh... not bad but nothing special. I would go back with friends, but not to grab a quick bite if I was solo."}
{"text":"I came into Melt before a concert I was in town for. The wait was something like an hour and fifteen and we were pressed for time so my fella and I decided to pass and grab a snack across the street at Panera and come back after the show. This was a great call. When we returned there was no wait and we were seated right away.  Now, this was one heck of a calorie bomb to eat right before retiring for the night but we were out of towners and wanted to try this place so we did it. I spend the rest of the evening in food coma, tummy distention in our hotel room but it was totally worth it.  The rundown-- We ordered a few of the appetizers to start. The pierogies and the buffalo tofu. As a Polish gal I'm pretty picky about my pierogie and these were tasty but not grandma made awesome. The buffalo tofu was also good, I liked the buffalo sauce and the tofu had a nice texture but again it didn't bowl me over. Over all, the appetizers were good but I wasn't completely blown away by either. If returning in the future I'm not sure I'd order them again just because they took up valuable stomach real estate that I would have preferred to fill with my sandwich, which was awesome.   For my meal I ordered the Monte Cristo--honey ham, smoked turkey, swiss, american, crispy battered & deep fried, mixed berry preserves. GOT. DAMN. This thing was good. I'm pretty sure I gained about 5 pounds just from eating one half, but it was GOOD. I was so full and so sad I could only get down one half, I was just too full from the appetizers. My fella got the sandwich of the month which was some sort of Thanksgiving inspired sandwich and he was buggin' it was so good. But he only could finish half as well. These are BIG sandwiches, after all, and they come with a side of tasty fries. Lots of food for around $10-$12!   The space is hella cool, our waitress was pleasant enough, they serve food late, and it's not crazy expensive for the amount of food you get and the quality. Plus they have a kick ass beer menu. Yes, I can see myself returning to Melt, but I'll be saving room for the sandwiches and the sandwiches alone. And coming late (or early) to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Huge grilled cheese sandwich's with tons of options. The tomato soup tastes more like marinara sauce though which was a bummer."}
{"text":"The most amazing place in Ohio and possibly the world to get \"grilled cheese\". I and my wife make a \"Melt\" date once a month to eat this delicious ambrosia.  I have never had a bad experience or bad food here!"}
{"text":"Finally! I've been wanting to check this place out for over a year.  Their cheesy food did not disappoint my cheesy desires.  Erm... you get the idea.  The only thing holding me back for a gift of 5 stars is that its too small, too crowded, and the wait is too long.  It's the sign of a well-loved restaurant, but I don't like bumping elbows with the stranger next to me while trying to eat my amazing food.  Specifically, I got the Cleveland Cheesesteak, and switched out the provolone for smoked gouda - perfection.  Fries were awesome.  Trendy hipsters servers provided great service, and something to giggle about."}
{"text":"No lie, the best way to my heart is through food. Especially when cheese and fries are thrown are a factor. Oh Melt, where have you been all my gluten free life?   What more needs to be said about Melt than already elated about by previous reviewers? Fantastic food. Fantastic service. Did I mention the fantastic service? When I mention to friends that I want to eat at Melt I normally get the cocked head confused look. \"You? The gluten intolerant wants to eat at a grilled cheese restaurant?\". Have no fear fellow gluten free friends, I'm not crazy, while gluten free bread is not on the menu yet Melt is happily b.y.o.b ( bring your own bread). They will not only happily make any sandwich gluten free. My heart just swooned. Grilled cheese and I are no longer on the rocks and have been reunited."}
{"text":"I went here a few day ago and had this amazing sandwich it was bigger than my hand!!! Server was very impatient because she asked what I wanted and I said could you come back to me she said no your ordering now! Like really! It also took 1 hour for food to come out but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"This was what I thought it would be. Filling, fun, and greasy. Every time I come to Cleveland everyone tells me to go here. (Perhaps its a big deal because of the pitiful selection of restaurants in Cleveland. Sorry!) Well, I must say that although it took a little long to get served by the bartender, he was friendly and recommended a good IPA. I ended up getting the Cleveland Cheese Steak. It was good, fries were ok, not crisp enough for my taste, but not bad. All in all I liked it. I'm sure if I was from Ohio I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great!!!! The fried Mac and Cheese appetizer is freakin great!!! Four big portions laying in melted cheese is all I need to say!! MMMMMMMMM! We had the Chorizo and Potato grilled cheese and the Pork Belly,Pulled Pork, Kimchee slaw grilled cheese!! All I can say is we will go every time we're in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone seems to love Melt. Because my office in Independence overlooks the restaurant I have seen people come by the busloads, Pose and  take selfie's in front of the restaurant, and fight to the death to park in front of it. There is not much to say that hasn't already been said, it's a fun place with good food. Probably not a place where you want to eat every day but more of a destination restaurant. So the next time you come up to see the Indians in the World Series or to celebrate the Cavs winning another world championship, make a stop at Melt to finish off the day and you won't be sorry. And my hunch is that you probably will sleep very soundly that night."}
{"text":"Whether you're visiting the Cleveland, Ohio area or your live around here, if you haven't already experienced Melt, GO THERE NOW! In fact, if you are for some reason reading this and aren't visiting Cleveland or planning a visit there, plan one just to go to this restaurant. It's that good.  First of all the atmosphere is great. The interior decor is really cool - eclectic and modern with just a little bit of weird. It's pretty small inside, which is why you often have to wait a while for a table (maybe even 2 hours if you go at a busy time but it's worth it). The bar is positioned in the back and is pretty large. If you're alone or with one other person I'd suggest trying to snag a seat at the bar. You're closer to all the great booze they have to offer and you don't have to wait an hour for a table. Plus the bartenders are really cool at this place. I could sit there and chat with them all day.  The menu (which is a recycled album cover) is ridiculously good. There's grilled cheese sandwiches on here that I would have never thought would exist or go well together, yet they just work. I suggest trying the Parmageddon, which is a grilled cheese with pierogi and sauerkraut... yum. My other favorites are the Mushroom Melt (like Heaven in your mouth) and the Big Popper which contains jalapenos, cream cheese and it comes with a mixed berry preserved dipped sauce which sounds weird but trust me it's really good. Needless to say there are plenty of grilled cheese concoctions to try and every once I'd tried so far has been even better than the last. P.S. don't you dare go to Melt and not order a grilled cheese or some kind, you've got to be crazy if you do that. Did I mention this place is super cheap at like around $10 a sandwich, plus you get a pile of fries and coleslaw too? Doesn't get any better than that...  The beer selection is awesome... theres a huge beer menu and many of them are on tap. Once I went to Melt over the holidays with a friend and we tried about 5 or 6 different holiday beers there alone. The menu has a pretty good description of what to expect from each beer but if you're still uncertain about trying something new, just ask your waiter or bartender and they'll give you a little sample. Which brings me to my next point...  The staff here is incredible. Everyone is super chill and cool and I feel like I'm hanging out with my friends every time I go there, even though they are all pretty much complete strangers. They are attentive and go above and beyond to make sure your experience is good while you're there.  The only bad thing about Melt is the wait for a table. Because this place is so darn good, everyone wants a piece. That means you could end up waiting 1-2 hours for a table if you go at peak hours. Even if you don't go at peak hours there's still usually some kind of wait. Don't even think about bringing a big group to this place, you'll never get seated. My suggestion to you would be to go with one or two other people and try to sit at the bar. You can order food from the bar and that way you don't have to wait and hour plus for a table. If you are set on getting a table, just grab a beer at the bar and sit on one of the open benches until it's ready. Trust me, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"So maybe if I really liked overpriced, trendy places I would love this place. Neat decor, neat idea, good service, very clean, lots a buzz (even though it is in a new strip mall).  Sadly, I don't like overpriced, trendy places."}
{"text":"Friday evening at the end of a challenging work week, feeling that a bit of indulgence would provide a positive punctuation mark, I closed up insurance shop for the day, walked Waldo dog, then got into the car with my sweetie and headed to Melt (this one, because Malley's is in the vicinity, and a hot fudge sundae might be good, restorative food as well, right?).  We decided to order a salad and a sandwich, and then split both of them;  ordering a half sandwich is a possibility, but the price reduction ($11 rather than $15) just seems silly.  We settled on a Crispy Chicken Salad (this place does not even pretend to have anything that your cardiologist would approve;  if you're looking for healthy, you will need to dine elsewhere) and The Dude Abides.  The restaurant was not busy (we arrived around 6pm), and our server did a very good job.  The salad was fine, and the sandwich looked scrumptious, but when we cut into it (I don't pick these sandwiches up with my bare hands), we found that the meatballs were very dry.  We were disappointed, and made do with the fried mozzarella in the sandwich, and set our sights on our dessert course (hot fudge can make a lot of things better)."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum.  We got here on a Wednesday night and it was packed!  They told us it would be at least a 2 hour wait.  So... we decided to get our order to go, which meant it would be *only* a 45 min to 1 hour wait.  It was worth it though!  I got the meatloaf sandwich- large portions, grilled bread with very hefty portions of meatloaf, mashed potatoes and cheese.  The fries are very tasty as well.  I will definitely come here again to dine in!"}
{"text":"Melt is the place in Cleveland for solid bar food.  It's amazing how many different things can go into a grilled cheese sandwich.  The portions are very large - I've gone several times with friends and have never seen someone not take part of the Godfather sandwich (lasagna on a grilled cheese sandwich) home. Every sandwich comes with a heaping portion of fries, which are very well seasoned and my favorite fries in Cleveland, and coleslaw, which tends to be lighter than coleslaw served at other restaurants.  My favorite sandwiches are the chorizo and potato and the blackened chicken sandwich.  There are also very creative \"sandwiches of the month\" which I often wish would be part of the regular menu.    Two pieces of advice - go at an off-peak hour, as the wait can be long during normal lunch and dinner hours.  And don't expect a salad to be a healthy option - you'll get as much bacon and cheese on your salad as you will get greens."}
{"text":"this was the largest grilled cheese/sandwich I have ever had. I was really pleased with how tasty the Parmegedeon was. for a meatless sandwich the pierogi was tasty and the crunch of the bread was delicious"}
{"text":"excellent place!! I had the brisket sandwich it was totally awsome and we also tried the Mac n cheese bites those were good too. great extensive beer list . this was my first time at melt and I would come back for sure staff was very good as well! not really a wine place and the wine glasses were not wiped off before the wine was poured. great place if u like beer and sandwiches"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Reminds me of Fatheads in Pittsburgh - we go here every time we are in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place with top notch grilled cheese.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Ok, we'll start w/ the DECOR. Very eclectic, various styles going on in here from all things holiday (Santa, Easter Bunny, a leprechaun, Frosty the Snowman, some jack-o-lanterns & other oddities). Additionally, various framed photographs of random people & landscapes, as well as various old renderings of Cleveland & other Ohio cities. Dim bar-like lighting, sticky wood lacquered tables, loud varied music styles, large full bar & rear outdoor seating available.   Now on to FOOD. If this review was based solely on portion size they would get 5 stars. Here comes the however...  Most of their dishes were lacking taste. Even a dash of salt goes a long way, but w/ so many included ingredients you just expect more.  You definitely must utilize their \"add ins\" for everything, including appetizers if you would like to enjoy your food. We ordered the Spinach Artichoke Dip - incredibly creamy and cheesy dip served hot and gooey with crisp tortillas - $8.00  Unfortunately, it was simply tasteless. Blue Buffalo Ranch Smothered Fresh Cut Fries - tossed in spicy buffalo, melted blue cheese, scallions, ranch drizzle - $8.50 - best thing about them as the presentation. Lacked any complexity in flavors, all you could taste was super salty buffalo sauce - that was it! Hubby was unimpressed by the Chorizo & Potato Grilled Cheese - fresh ground spicy sausage and hearty potato hash, sharp cheddar - $9.50 - shockingly, taste just wasn't there. Came w/ Chicken Chipotle Soup, which tasted like someone spilled all the salt intended for the other dishes in his tiny little cup. Pretty sure it gave him high blood pressure. I added sautéed garlic & plain arugula to my Mighty Macaroni Grilled Cheese - creamy homemade macaroni & cheese battered and deep fried, layered with cheddar cheese sauce & your favorite melted cheese- $12.50 Mmmmm mmmm mmmmmh. Hubby & I enjoyed this sandwich twice it was so humongous- see my attached pic. We agreed that it wouldn't have been good enough w/out the add-ins. By far was the best of the items we ordered. Would buy that specific dish again, nothing else."}
{"text":"It's ok. I thought the quality of ingredients would be much higher. It's a simple concept and simple food so I thought they'd use better cheese and better ham etc. I ordered a Monte Cristo. There wasn't much ham, turkey or cheese. It was mostly bread and breading ( at least on half of it anyway ). It was just ok. I waited a longtime for it. Really good pickles and awesome house fries. I had a couple great specialty cocktails. Hard not to give them 4 stars but the lame bottled corn syrup ketchup convinced me that they weren't trying quite hard enough for me. $11 for this sandwich didn't work for me."}
{"text":"We showed up at 11am when Melt opened, and there was no wait. I'm not saying everyone should show up when the place opens in order to get a seat, but for those who take the time to come on here and complain about waiting, don't come during peak hours. DUH!   Now the food. We got the spinach artichoke dip w/ chips as an appetizer. Very good. Probably the best I've had. And there was something about the chips that I really liked, too. I would definitely order it again.  I got the Parmageddon as my sandwich. After looking at the menu online for a week before we came, I knew it was going to come down to that or the Peanut Butter and Banana. I asked the waitress for her opinion, and while she highly recommended both, I went with the Parmageddon. Soooooo good. Bread was perfectly buttered and toasted. The pierogis were awesome. I was a little apprehensive about the kraut, but it turned out awesome. The fries and slaw on the side were average, but I hardly noticed given the awesomness of the sandwich. Yeah, that was 3 awesomes.  Since I've always wanted to try one, I got a deep fried Twinkie for dessert. It didn't exceed my expectations, but it was still really good. I mean how can a deep fried Twinkie not be good?"}
{"text":"I live in California. This place has the BEST MELT I HAVE EVER HAD. I don't really like to eat sandwiches, ever, but the melts here blow my mind. I can't really compare it any other sandwich grill spot, maybe The Melt (completely different restaurant) in the Bay Area, but only for the savory taste of the grilled cheese, not the whole shebang of a meal.  The Melt of Cleveland Heights, OH, has a rather inspiring menu of unique melts. It is a large pub, with large bar seating in the center. Yes! I approve of places that serve beer and sports television with greasy food! It just seems right.  I've tried the Cleveland Cheese Steak (favorite), Cuban Melt, and a chicken melt that I can't remember the name of for the life of me. The cheese steak was extremely juicy, cheesy, salty, fulfilling...and everything bad for you but tastes so good. The side of fries really completes this heavy meal. I had a mimosa as well. I probably could have hibernated for for a few days from this meal.   GET THE RANCH FOR THE FRIES. And if you want to change or cut the contents of the sandwich in the two halves, the server is happy to take that down for you. :) Awesome place, wish it were in California as well."}
{"text":"Super awesome grilled cheese sandwiches!! Everyone should go here! They have so many options! I say try the Mac and cheese grilled cheese! The sandwiches are huge! You definitely get your monies worth!"}
{"text":"This place and the food they served me was awesome. The sandwiches were huge and the contents high quality. I had the Mushroom melt. They have a nice selection of craft beer. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Since moving back to Ohio, Melt has just been killing the vegetarian/vegan scene in Cleveland! They've revamped the menu, adding new sandwhiches, and adding a vegan option for almost every one they offer now.   And it gets better! Now the second weekend of every month has an entire menu featuring special vegetarian/vegan options."}
{"text":"Nice that this location isn't as long of a wait now that there are others around Cleveland. Sometimes no wait at all, often no wait if you're willing to sit at the bar.   With the new menu changes, im LOVING the Hungry Hungarian. omg so good. But wish they'd bring back the Ninja Turtle sammie and keep the Big Girl Coffee drink on the menu!"}
{"text":"So, I was working in Cleveland and heard tales of this amazing grilled cheese restaurant and all I could think was \"I must try this place!\" and I am insanely glad I did.  I've bragged on this restaurant to anyone who will listen and am a little miffed that they don't have locations nationwide.    First and foremost, their beer selection is phenomenal!  Craft beers a plenty!  They put a lot of thought into their selection and the bartenders are very familiar with it and offer excellent recommendations based on your tastes.  We tried a creme brulee stout that was out of this world.  We introduced one of our coworkers to IPA and now he's hooked on them. lol  So, even if you don't go for the amazing food...the beer selection and knowledgeable staff are worth a visit.  The food....was...awesome.  The sandwiches are HUGE and stuffed full of deliciousness!  We had a large table of chatty coworkers who hadn't seen eachother in a long time and once our food arrived ....conversation stopped. lol  Others at the table ordered straight off the menu and all of them made \"mmm\" noises as they happily ate their sammiches.  I built my own with bacon, pepperjack cheese, grilled onions and avocado....it was awesome.  They put SOOOO much bacon on it!  It was glorious!    They need to open one of these in Austin, TX so I can eat there all the time! lol"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's unlike any restaurant I have been to before. The size of the sandwiches, the imagination, the ingredients, the quirky atmosphere...so fun and tasty.   I had the Westside Monte Cristo and loved it. It consists of honey ham, smoked turkey, swiss and american cheeses all in-between two thick slices of bread, then battered and deep fried, and served with a side of mixed berry preserves. It's like a funnel cake engulfed your Thanksgiving leftover sandwich - which makes it at least 3x better.   This is one of those unique dining experiences that leaves you wanting more. The next time I'm in Cleveland you better believe I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Right from the start I will say, Melt has excellent food. The place itself is also pretty cool, even though it is pretty much half bar inside. Our server was even top notch during our visit. So I give them ten stars for the food, and ten for our waiter. I'll subtract eighteen for the hostess. You've probably seen her there. She is the one who's giving death glares to all who enter and just. looks. MISERABLE. We stopped in because we were meeting some friends we don't get to see very often. Wanted to have a nice lunch! We brought along some kids....well 4. Now that means we had to seat all these small humans and after waiting there for about 20 minutes, shoveling what small snacks we had stashed for them I ask about this perfect large table in the corner. They say they are waiting for 'our' table to sign checks and we'd be in. I'm told \"that table is for 8 adults, but we'll sit you there if they take long\". Apparently 4 adults, 4 kids, 2 baby carriers, bags, high chairs, and coats = less space than 8 adults.  After another ten minutes of staring at the empty awesome table, we get to go around the corner to 'ours'. It's two, tiny round tables pushed together with high chairs haphazardly thrown around it. We get the joy of getting situated around that mess. Meanwhile there are plenty of groups of four waiting for a table! Why not give me the one I want, and then let two more parties in!?? Point being mrs. Miserable hostess girl really ruined the whole experience and what could have been a great visit. That's part of the reason people go out to eat. It's about the service. This place needs the kinks worked out in that regard.... Or maybe get the first person you see not to be the last person you want to...."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place! If you like tons of bread with little in between this is your place. I have been here exactly 3 times. I believe in 3 strikes and your out! The owner Matt Fish is nice and gave me a gift card the second time. We went on a Tuesday night at 9pm it was busy enough so we took a seat at the bar. We waited 15 minutes before anyone greeted us. There was one bartender and the bar was packed. We finally got our drinks another 15 minutes later., another 15 minutes later our bartender took our order another 20 minutes she asked if we wanted another drink...glass is empty, yes please! 60 minutes later food arrives :-( 2 big pieces of bread and hardly anything in the middle. 30 minutes later bartender asks how food is? My partner is not one to complain. I however will and do! I told her not as good as the first time I was here and I hate to tell you the service is lousy tonight. She didn't seem to care much. She was working her butt off and I took that into consideration with regard to her tip.  I hate to say it, but I'm over Melt. Drinks are good, food is over rated. I guess if your drunk enough you wont care much about the food or the service."}
{"text":"As much hype and popularity as Melt has received during the last few years, it still is one of the most fun, unique restaurants I've been to.  I first dined at Melt when there was only the lone location in Lakewood, OH, and it was only known to locals. I was amazed by the size of the platters, the portions, and the idea of taking an after-school favorite and combining it with fries and a beer. It's a winning combination to say the least.   The creativity of the menu also caught my eye. On first thought, one would think that you can't do too much with a grilled cheese sandwich. Melt found several ways to enrich and enhance Mom's recipe to include extras like fish, pierogis, bratwurst, eggs, bacon, veggies, burgers, and much more. The restaurant's atmosphere is trendy, but sometimes out of left field; however, it only adds to the experience because nothing -even the 80s plastic holiday statues- seems out of place. The menus were and are still one of the coolest I've ever seen. Taking old vinyl album covers, they print the menus on the backs while the album cover remains on the front. It's a nostalgic look at some of the greatest artists and it ties to Cleveland's love for rock music. It becomes somewhat competitive to reveal what album you receive compared to your friends. The names of the sandwiches are as unique as the restaurant itself. Make sure to try each one at least once. The variety of cheeses and glaciers is staggering, yet wholly delicious. If you're lucky, you might catch someone attempting the famous Melt Challenge. Holy Clogged Intestine, Batman!  The only negative on Melt is the wait time. I've never quite figured out why, lately,it takes 45 minutes to sit down at a table when half the restaurant is empty. However, don't let the wait deter you. You can mosey on up to the bar and grab a brew while you wait, or you can up there too - I recommend this. It's a good way to beat the wait time, and the bartenders are very friendly and accommodating.   If you haven't tried Melt yet, do it now."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's melt! A Lakewood staple. I try to stick to one visit a year given the high fat/cal meals which I don't want to have to resist! What a great place for a vegetarian. Almost every sandwich has a vegetarian option or substitute. I love the big popper. If you like jalepeno, you will love this sweet, salty, spicy blend."}
{"text":"Yummy food and a great variety of choices and lots of art on the walls to look at the only reason i gave 4 stars and not 5 is because its so crowded and so loud and you really have to be in the mood for something like that"}
{"text":"Omg I had a Monte crusto  that was to die for! I could not eat the entire thing the jam was amaze balls! Probably the best sandwich I've ever had (grilled cheese style) the fact that it was deep fried should've given me a heart attack but it was awesome and huge I only ate a quarter of the sandwich and an order of fries was really too much you only need the sandwich."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, large selection of grilled cheese even vegan grilled cheese.  They have loaded fries with regular or vegetarian chili (great twist).  The selection of beers is great but most of all the price is not too high.  At times the restaurant may have a longer than usual wait because of a smaller dining room, but I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this place! I decided to treat my boyfriend and my parents to The Melt for all of their help with my college graduation party (a review on the venue to come!). The service here has always been spot on for me. The hosts are so friendly and the servers and great. I specifically love that they have vegan and gluten free options, since I am lactose intolerant, and I can eat anything on the menu with the options they offer. I just love eating here and the price is right on as well. This time I ordered the Backyard BBQ Sandwich along with the Strawberry Sashay cocktail. I loved the amount of bbq sauce they put on the sandwich, I always feel that restaurants never put enough on, but that isn't the case here. I got a side of the kettle chips which are my favorite house-made chips to date and seriously  wish they sold them in bags! The cocktail was so delicious as well! I can never say enough great things about The Melt and I look forward to eating here once again!"}
{"text":"Not to mince words, but Heather is the best server I've ever had. Period. The decor and decadent food was emasculated when set against her vibrant personality.  Parking was alright."}
{"text":"Like all Melts, the food is phenomenal!  I am here the second day of the grand opening, in Avon, Ohio.  The wait for a table is out the door, however being alone, I got a spot at the bar.  Like always, I got the Cleveland Cheese Steak, can't go wrong with this monstrous morsel.  The tender beef and garlic mushroom concoction makes one mouth \"Melt\", it's so fabulous!  The fried tomatoes were absolutely delectable, perfectly crispy.  The fire roasted corn salsa accompanied by the remoulade was a perfect match.  I'll be back, when I'm back on business!  I wish Melt existed in the Chicagoland area!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable grilled cheese sandwiches with a cornucopia of scrumptious fillings.  I have been to a few locations and Lakewood attracts all walks of life and makes you feel welcome upon entry.  They all have been great, but I definitely like Lakewood the best!!!!  The food and portions are incredible.  After eating here, I recommend going to Lakewood park, to walk off the calories.  When I get back to Cleveland, I WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and I love their extensive vegan menu! Awesome drinks and always friendly service! Melt is my go to place"}
{"text":"Went to The Melt for the first time yesterday and man oh man was it delicious!! We ordered some buffalo tofu for appetizers and it was great. As far as sandwiches go, everyone ordered a different sandwich and I opted for the Smokey Russian. When the plate came out I was not dissatisfied at all. The huge sandwich is served along with some fries. My sandwich was delicious. The bread was nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The turkey, sour kraut, and smoked Gouda combo was dive! I only ate half the sandwich because it was so big, I took the other half home to finish for dinner that same night. Overall great experience and great food. If I ever visit Ohio again, I will definitely stop at the melt to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"This place has been reviewed by many, featured on TV, and is PACKED to the brim everyday so I am not sure if my review will sway anyones decision, but here it is nonetheless.    LIke I said above, its very crowded.  Get there early and expect to wait..almost without exception.  The beer list is 9/10....they have a great selection and wide offerings for everyone.  The cole slaw that is served with the sandwiches is amazing.  Its a bit spicy and dry...I don't think there is any mayo in it whatsoever.  The fries are delicious, you can tell they are made in house.   Now...for the sandwiches.  They are enormous, and the bread is very thick.  I have tried three different sandwiches.   The dude abides is pretty solid...the meatballs are huge.  My favorite was a greek style sandwich, not sure if they keep it on the menu year round.  The bottom line is if you want a really quality, unhealthy, huge, delicious sandwich...this is your place.  Grab a beer, get rolled home and call it a day."}
{"text":"Great bar atmosphere...great beer selection.  Menu looks great, wide selection of sandwiches.   Went simple for my first visit--a Monte Cristo--delicious.   Love the berry compote for dipping.   Definitely plan to visit often once I move to the area."}
{"text":"A sandwich joint that makes other sandwich joints irrelevant!   O.M.G. the BEST hot sammich EVER!  Ordered a Cleveland Steak and Cheese, minus the garlic mushrooms because fungus and I ain't good together, and it was melted sammich heaven!  No kidding... hands down the BEST of the BEST I have ever had!    Daughter ordered the Chicken and Waffles and told me, \"This is the best sandwich I have ever eaten!\"  Son ordered the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken w/no slaw and blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  WOW!  This 11 yr old boy has become quite the blue cheese taste tester and reported the 'house made' blue cheese dressing the best he's ever had!  My husband confirmed, upon tasting it himself, that this was indeed fact.  Cannot buy dressing, per se, but we bought 2 sides of it to bring home to  Chicago.  Husband had the Bushman, declaring it delicious!  The sandwich was double decked and he hadn't expected that, but amazingly constructed with a fantastic taste!  Our littlest guy had chicken fingers and actually ate them up, which is truly high praise because this kid rarely finishes an entire meal.  My 11 yr old wants them to open Melts in Chicagoland, but my cholesterol couldn't handle having it so close!  Melt, however, is a must if you're visiting Cleveland!  So glad I took the advise of a coworker and ventured out to get it!"}
{"text":"Love this place...so innovative and delicious.  All of their melts sound absolutely amazing and I would love to try them all!  We try to visit Melt every time we are in Cleveland and are never disappointed.  Last time we were there (which was over Christmas) my husband had the macaroni and cheese melt; I think it is only available during the month of December and it is oh so good!  I had the Parmageddon (2 potato & cheese pierogi, fresh napa vodka kraut, sautéed onions, sharp cheddar) which was equally delish.  The melts are huge and could easily be shared.  The decor is fresh and funky...and they have a superb beer selection.  Now that there are other locations, the wait time might not be as long but expect to wait for a short time if coming during busy times.  This place is great and I truly love the atmosphere, food, and beer!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from co-workers, and it's really close to my hotel, so I tried it out. The atmosphere and the decor are awesome - very good feel to this place - very unique and cool decor. The service was okay, but nothing special. The food was not good at all.  I had the \"Wet Buffalo\" grilled cheese sandwich, which was a fried buffalo chicken breast on a grilled cheese sandwich.  Everythign was just a mess - the chicken just tasted like cooking oil.  You'd think a place that bills itself for its grilled cheese would have good bread.  The bread just crumbled.  I know this sandwhich was probably not designed to be picked up and eaten, but that would have been impossible.  Everything was just sloppy and greasy and didn't taste good. I was there for lunch, so I didn't order from the bar, but they've got a great beer selection if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good service. The only down side is the bartender skill. I ordered a lavender mojito, but the bartender didn't have all the ingredients for the cocktail and it was obvious on the taste factor.  No private parking available, only street and meter parking."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I want to try just about everything on the menu.  Highest recommendations for the Lake Erie Monster, with jalapeno tartar sauce.  A word of advice...don't get an appetizer.  It's not that they're not good, it's just that your grilled cheese and mound of fries is gonna be so huge, you're not gonna be able to finish it all...even without the appetizer.  I still haven't made it to dessert here yet.  And I really, really wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly bread pudding (pout).  Also, check out their specials of the month...some really good grilled cheese specials in there!  For August 2013, their special is \"The Pig Roast\" grilled cheese (chipotle BBQ pulled pork, fried sweet potato, coleslaw, monster cheese), side of grilled sweet corn with roasted garlic spread, and homemade redskin potato salad.  And it was just Awesome!  PS - I can't believe there are people on here complaining that they give you TOO MUCH FOOD.  Really?  That's your complaint?  Too much food?  Really?  Really.  Really??"}
{"text":"Still 5*!  3 years later and still incredibly delicious!  I believe their vegan/vegetarian options have increased!!  This time around I tried the chorizo and potato (vegetarian) added an egg and asked them to batter and deep fry (additional $2), holy crap was it amazing!  While in town I also tried the cheese steak (vegetarian), and the buffalo chicken (vegetarian).   They make all their faux meats in house!! Delicious!  I also tried the Northside drink (I believe that is that name)  Tasty!"}
{"text":"this place is great! The food was delicious and the staff was amazing. They were very accommodating checked in a few times letting us know the status etc. There was a bit of a wait but they were busy so completely understandable. Loved the vibe and music too! - If you ask for extra bacon expect EXTRA bacon haha. I cant wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoy every sandwich I've had here. In particular,  the Big Popper. A nice crispy outer shell housing delicious and spicy fresh cut jalapeños inside. Have no fear the berry compote served as its dipping sauce helps to knock down the burn along with the meaty gooey cheese oozing out of the first bite.   Ma's meatloaf is good. Dude Abides is tasty. Trust the staff they know what to do with that menu."}
{"text":"First off, get past the wait. It's good food and you're going to have to wait for it. Yes once you get seated you're going to have to wait some more, but that's because everything is made to order and is fresh. The food is totally worth it though and there's an incredible beer selection.   If you think it sounds good on the menu it WILL be good. I'm partial to the Hot Italian with banana peppers added in, though you'd be hard pressed to find a bad sandwich."}
{"text":"If you haven't been, it's worth the trip. This is comfort food (read carb coma) that leaves you with little remorse. Delicious, creative combinations and twists on old faves. I'll be back. Service was great, no wait, and a dynamic environment that was accommodating to both road warriors and family gatherings."}
{"text":"Wow...  What can I say about this place?  It's a bar and grill where you go to have about 50 types of grilled cheese sandwhiches.  It's greasy, disgusting, loaded with fat, and hits just about every pressure point on the comfort food chart you can think of.  It's four kinds of fucking delicious.  Short version, it's yummy.  Go there, go early to avoid the rush, buy a peanut butter and banana grilled cheese if you have the balls, and don't think youself unmanly when you dip even your fries into the berry preserves dipping sauce that comes with it (oh, that delicious berry preserve dipping sauce, my heart pines for you still)...  Long version:  I flew out to Cleveland to meet my girlfriend's family for Thanksgiving.  Now anyone who has ever had Thanksgiving before knows that only their own family cooks Thanksgiving dinner the right way and no one (and I mean, but no one) can even come close to topping your Aunt Tessa's, locally famous, hot and whipped, raccoon and radicchio casserole.  They just can't!  So, right off the bat I was in the mood for something to help make up for the lack of my mother's mashed potatoes in my gullet.  I've heard of this place on a number of different Food Channel shows and my girlfriend and her brother both loved it, so I was ready to spend a Saturday night at Melt Bar and Grilled.  When you enter the door, the place is packed to the gills with many a group waiting outside.  For some people this is a put-off; for myself, it's a sign of good things to come.  And when you're with friends, family, people you like and / or want to get to know, you should have no problem spending an hour or so waiting for a seat while you laugh and drink beer.  We got three seats at the bar within 5 minutes despite the throngs of happy diners, so no problem there.  The atmosphere is crazy, Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Halloween decorations strung everywhere like the first few months of Kindergarten exploded all over it.  The bar is laced with video game plaques from the 80's (FROGGER, REPRESENT!) and the menus are printed on the back of vinyl ablum covers.  I was lucky enough to be graced with Wham!'s, very own, 'Make it Big.'  I know you men out there are jealous, don't be hatin'.  We waited close to 45 minutes for the food, which was surprising for the content, but it was delicious nonetheless.  I had the potato and chorizo grilled cheese.  Perfect amount of spice, enough cheese to give the sandwhich that gooey feel, without being a gloppy mess, and soft potatoes that were cooked well enough to melt on the tongue perfectly (as opposed to being undercooked crunchy or overcooked cinders / paste).  The bread is thick cut sourdough, making it a bit overly chewy, but good.  The sandwhich itself was one of the smaller ones, so I was able to polish off the whole thing, but don't expect most of the others to be the same.  My girlfriend had a Parma, Italy.  Tasty and huge, but it paled in comparison to her brother who opted for a Grilled Peanut Butter and Banana grilled cheese.  Holy Mary, Mother of Fuck, that was delicious.  For those of you who don't understand flavor combinations and just go, \"oh, my god!  Peanut butter on grilled cheese!  EWW!\", know that sweet and salty are ... FANTASTIC together!  Next time you're snacking chocolate covered pretzels, caramel popcorn, peanut M&M's, or Chex Mix, remember that you scoffed at the thought of this sandwich.  Weirdos.  And they have Stone Pale Ale!  I live in San Diego County, that micro brew is a staple here.  But traveling 2500 miles and seeing a local Arrogant Bastard Ale on tap was a trip.  Apparently its a top seller for them, too!  So, to wrap up, this place was brilliant.  Great atmosphere, great food, great fun.  I thoroughly reccomend it.  The only reasons I'm giving this a four instead of a five star rating are that I'm a stingy bastard when it comes to my ratings, I can easily see how the wait times (for both sitting down AND getting your food after ordering) can detract from some peoples' experiences, and even though the food was damn tasty, it wasn't that damn tasty that makes my nipples hard enough to cut diamond.  That is saved for a select few.  If you're in town, make a point to go here."}
{"text":"Melt is the best sandwich joint in America.  Picture this: gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches, made with inch thick french bread and the best kinds of amazing cheese. (Chevre, gruyere, gouda, etc etc etc) Add to that every kind of show stoppingly amazing meats; blue crab meat, blackened chicken, chorizo, perogies (yes I said perogies) and every other wild idea for sandwich stuffers.  I don't live in the Cleveland area any more, but when im in town, we MAKE time for Melt. It's that good.  Try to read the menu (printed on the back of old vinyl records, a nice tough) and try to keep from drooling. Physically impossible. Entrees such as smoked turkey, fresh napa vodka kraut, smoked gouda, russian dressing  on those thick slices of bread.....or even spicy mexican sausage, potato hash, and sharp cheddar turns your fancy. Melt will find your sweet spot.   The beer selection is excellent; the hipsterlicious joint stocks offerings from Bells, Stone, Great Lakes, and lots of other great local breweries.   Brunch on Sundays is exceptional; come here pre-Browns games to enjoy Waffles with ice cream and spiced apples, Pancakes with all sorts of fruit stuffing, perfectly fluffy eggs.....etc etc.  What i'm saying has been said a hundred times over; this is one of the most beloved restaurants in Cleveland. Fight through the wait (put your name down and then grab a beer, or stop in at one of the dozen bars within walking distance) and try this, at least once. You owe it to yourself.  If the biggest problem a spot has is the overwhelming demand for it, I think they're probably doing something right.....no?"}
{"text":"Keep in mind that even once you get seated here and place an order, you are likely to wait 60-90 minutes for your food. Fine if you know this in advance and are looking forward to a few beers and a leisurely evening, but not at all acceptable otherwise.  The food itself is generally good and shows some creativity, but also occasionally poor execution. After several visits to both locations I am starting to wonder if there is more sizzle here than steak. All of the publicity and media attention seems to have gone to their heads a bit or maybe caused a loss of focus on what matters -- food and service."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Melt in a few years so I was anxious to see what had changed. My sandwich of choice, the godfather, has been perfected! The sauce has somehow been altered but really compliments the sandwich instead of overpowering it and making the bread soggy.   Not only is the beer list unbelievably long, they have beers that you'd only dream of finding at an actual bar. All of the staff was super nice and made my visit as enjoyable as I hoped.   Born and raised in Cleveland, I can honestly say that Melt has become a real asset and gem in the community."}
{"text":"Great food, but my last experience here suffered from poor service. I met my wife and a friend for lunch on a Friday afternoon for a quick lunch. We knew to get there ASAP to get a seat and grab spots at the bar. We ordered their movie related weekend sandwiches (a tasty club sandwich). The problem was (according to them) that the system had an error that resulted in our ticket not printing in the kitchen. If our server had checked on us in the hour that we waited for our meal, the mistake would've been noticed. Finally, we asked someone else (only person we could find) to check. They talked to the kitchen, then the manager, then our server, and then walked away. No one updated us. I had to ask someone else to find out our problem. They got the food out to us in about 1hr and 10mins. While we waited, they got us some fries and slaw, which was nice. They comped a portion of the meal but not all of it, which they should have done because I had to work late on a Friday afternoon to make up for my late return from lunch.  Melt dropped the ball on service (didn't check on us, get the order in, tell us about the issue, or pick up the meal for the errors) but the food was good (as usual)."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have to stop here for food when we travel to Cleveland for fun! The eclectic decor and the always friendly staff is a plus. And the food has never disappointed!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner, ending our Cleveland adventure. I saw the place on Man V Food and it was definitely on my list. They have a good amount of vegetarian options, and I really had a hard time choosing. Ultimately, I chose between the eggplant sandwich and the mushroom melt and ended up with the mushroom melt.  So yummy!! Caramelized onions make ANYTHING and it certainly was awesome on this sandwich. It was like french onion soup on bread. YUM. The fries, I wasn't so keen on - yes they were hand cut and fresh and crunchy, but they weren't super flavorful. Could have used a frying in either tastier oil or a seasoning. The coleslaw is vinegar based, which is a welcome addition to the fatty cheesyness that is their sandwiches.  I'd love to return and try the eggplant one, the spinach one, or the jalapeno one, but the plates are HUGE. I only ate half, and that was good enough for me. My coworker had the half regular grilled cheese, salad, and cup of tomato, which looked like a much better portion. I would totally recommend that Melt make half specialty sandwiches (not just the regular) with a soup/salad. That would be AWESOME. Otherwise, I just need a friend to come and split everything with me. Oh yeah, and also the tomato soup was reaaally salty. Flavorful, but salty - Melt, please cut the salt.  PS the wait was supposed to be an hour and a half for a table, but luckily we found room at the bar. By 8, the place had pretty much emptied out.  Most plates are around $8 which is soo cheap. Cleveland, your food is so cheap!!"}
{"text":"I dined at the Independence location today.  It was my long anticipated first visit and I didn't have a good experience.  Our waiter was friendly and seemed to be trying to make the best out of whatever must have been going on behind the scenes.  That is pure speculation on my part in an effort to give the benefit of the doubt. -Ordered a bottle of wine because he said if we didn't finish it he could seal the bottle to take home. We later found out that wasn't the case and we would not be able to take the rest home. Next, the wine  glasses were filthy.  He told us not to worry because all of the glassware gets sterilized but he'd bring us new glasses if we'd prefer. WHAT?! -Had to ask for our appetizer 45 minutes after we ordered it and it finally came after our dinner was served.Our waiter volunteered to take it off the bill.  Good thing because the bottom of the pierogi's were BLACK. When our lukewarm sandwiches were served I wanted sweet relish on the side and I was told they don't carry it but I'd have a pickle with my meal. NO PICKLE.  I ordered a swiss, bacon, onion sandwich.  When I bit into the sandwich I thought they forgot the cheese so I asked my waiter if there was a mistake. I was informed that swiss isn't a \"melting\" cheese it's a \"shrinking\" cheese. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? I'm in the food industry and I've never used shrinking swiss cheese.   I couldn't make this stuff up!  My sandwich was COLD and that's why my cheese shrank!  I took half home and warmed it and yep you guessed it...My delicious warm drippy swiss cheese appeared.YUMMY!  The place was packed for sure so I get that mistakes happen, but geez.  Overall it just wasn't an experience to line up with the reputation of the place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food and beers.  Huge sandwiches.  The half orders are enough for most but if you're hungry go for the full.    The sandwiches are served with fries that are similar to Five Guys.   Pierogi appetizer was a good choice.   Servers are very friendly.  Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sure we had to wait for a table- gave us a chance to hang out at the bar and make new friends :) Bartender was very efficient- we were given the option to eat at the bar but we opted to just drink until a table was available.Food was good- lots of it- coleslaw was yummy and food and atmosphere both delightful. I would recommend !!"}
{"text":"A Haiku for my experience at Melt:  Mammoth sandwiches. Monte Cristo a delight.  Quirk, fun, and long wait."}
{"text":"I'm from Minnesota and here on business, this place is amazing! I got a pepper jack grilled cheese sandwich and Buffalo chicken chowder. To. Die. For! Loved the atmosphere and the service was great. If you like a SUPER horseradishy bloody you'll love theirs... If you don't I'd opt for another beverage."}
{"text":"Both my wife agree, way overated, mediocre grilled cheese sandwichs at best.  Not worth visiting a second time.  Must be all the hype of rave revues, 'cause it certainly is NOT the food.... yuk"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and I got the specialty sandwich of the month!  The firecracker chicken (with tofu, vegetarian style).  It was fantastic!  The bread was warm and hearty, cole slaw fresh and crunchy and delicious thick cut fries.  I really love checking out the specialty sandwich of the month but I also love the Lake Erie Monster and the Eggplant sandwich at Melt!  It's an Ohio staple.  I always try to bring people out of town to Melt."}
{"text":"The melt is one of out go to spots.  The food.is very consistent and reliable. The service and atmosphere  is always good."}
{"text":"This is one of the only restaurants I can legitly give a 5 star rating to... Not because the sandwiches are so special but because of everything that melt has managed to do. Their drinks selection is great the atmosphere is awesome, the service is top notch, even that the price is right!   Matt Fish, the owner, has a great sense for what the community in the near suburbs of Cleveland wants and his restaurants reflect his ability to supply that need.  I live within walking distance of this place and will always call an order in and pick it up on my way home from work.  Melt has made me a firm believer in the idea that there is a grilled cheese shaped hole in all of us!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were great, the vibe is fun, the service was really good under the circumstances, and even waiting an hour plus on a Friday night wasn't too bad - but it wasn't *so good* that I'd wait an hour again.  The bad?  Super-noisy, and I normally think that's par for the course when you're going to a bar.  Also, the sides were just okay - the coleslaw in particular seemed underdressed, and underwhelming.  In the end, I felt like it might be more fun to work there than to eat there, and I already have a favorite bar in Lakewood."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cleveland cheese steak it was absolutely amazing! Great food,great drinks. I also highly recommend the sriracha ranch"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the 5 star ratings.  I came here based on recommendations and will never need to return.    Pros: -Didn't have to wait long for a table for 6 -Service was good for food and drinks -Good beer selection  Cons: -The quality of the food was mediocre at best.  There are several local diners with much better food. -Distorted value.  Spending $12+ dollars on a grilled cheese sandwich and fries that would feed an army seems like a good deal, but anything you take home will not taste good later.  -Calories.  This chain is probably responsible for Cleveland winning the award of fattest city in America.  A splurge is worth it every now and then, but not here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Went here for lunch and got the chorizo and potato sandwich, which comes with fries and a pickle. The fries were good I wish they were slightly crispier, but that's me. The sandwich was tasty and the bread crispy. I really liked that the bread didn't get soggy. I do wish the chorizo had more flavoring tho. Overall a really cool restaurant, very clean, and the staff is nice.   Few things I didn't like were that they aren't open for lunch Mon - Thurs, the tables are really small for 4 people, and its slightly pricey for a quick lunch bite. But I'm glad I found this place, it's one of the better places in Mentor!   Tip: Get a half a sandwich, I was barely able to eat half of my whole sandwich. Or just save the rest for seconds."}
{"text":"The only way you could give this place a bad review is if your tastebuds were completely broken.  I came here today on the comment that they have giant sandwiches (I haven't eaten since 7 a.m. when I landed in ATL), so needless to say I was hungry by 6:30 p.m.  So I'm from the south, naturally I ordered the Chicken and Waffle Melt.  It was the perfect balance of sweet, salty, spicy, and juicy chicken!  And I have the other half for lunch tomorrow ..."}
{"text":"If you want to eat something sinfully delicious and don't mind a good shame sweat after eating this is the place for you. This place  was recommended by one of my employees who knows how I am with food. We stopped in for a take out order and it was all he promised.  It's a really big restaurant with extremely high ceilings, the decorations are similar to hipster spots in Williamsburg. It's a blend of pop and little punk rock urban appeal. The staff was really helpful and I had a Purple Parma which was eggplant and provolone. I had to dislocate my jaw to eat it, which is always a good sign of things to come. Heavy with cheese and grease and bread. The only thing missing was a defibrillator which totally would have been welcomed.  Eat here! and thank me later."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here while in Avon, and I was very underwhelmed.  While the restaurant and layout itself was quite nice (with very cool photos and tour posters of rock stars and other vintage family pics adorning the walls), the total experience just did not deliver for me.  We ordered Melt cheeseburgers, and they were below average.  The meat tasted cheap and low quality, like something you would get at a budget conscious Aldi's or Sav-A-Lot, etc.  There was even gristle in my burger which was very dissapointing and disgusting.  I also asked for 'well done' and got medium-rare, with ample pink showing throughout the center of the burger.  Also, the large slices of bread the burger comes on are no match for a proper burger bun.  At this point, I just took the meat off in order to try and salvage my dinner, so I was left with a repurposed cheeseburger turned grilled cheese sandwich with lettuce and onions.  To be honest, places like The Rail or B-Spot blow away these burgers.  Oh, and the fries were greasy and some even undercooked and raw.  I would say i'm 'one and done' with this joint, but I know my daughter loves to come here, so if I do come back, i'll have to try something else for sure.  The employees were very kind and professional."}
{"text":"Finally schlepped my way out to 'Melt Bar & Grilled' after all these years.  While the grilled cheese sandwiches and burgers were very good, the fries were soft and undercooked.  The coffee tasted average, at best, and I was only given one measly creamer.  Most annoying was the fact that it took forever to get our food served (they're sandwiches for chrissakes), and the place reminded me of an old, worn out train station or church.  After just about 15 minutes sitting on those dated old wooden bench seats, my aching arse longed for those comfortable, padded, high-back leather bench seats I sat in the night before at 'The Rail' in North Olmsted!  The place was also a bit pricey for what you're getting.  For me, this was an average experience, all things considered.  I give it 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Yuck. Not a fan. At. All. Greazy grossness at every turn. No booths, only tables, and the food was covered in weird sauces and cheeses. For the price, I was disgusted."}
{"text":"This is the WORST place in terms of customer service. They consistently act as if they are too cool or important to wait on you. The orders are often wrong and wait is horrible. It would be one thing if the food was amazing, it is NOT. That act like they are selling the cure for cancer but it is only a decent Grill cheese. Many of my friends swear to never come here because of the horrible service. I use to make excuses no longer. I will not be back"}
{"text":"Melt - how I've tried to lemming myself to bask in the glorious religious devotion to your sandwiches as the rest of Greater Cleveland. But you are just...so different yet not special.   I've had the parmageddon, the godfather(?), a firecracker chicken special, and one of the burgers. Sadly, the burger was my favorite - almost because of the ridiculously smothering of salted grease filled sauce that poses as cheese, reminded me of what I wanted in a burger in college years.  This place does to sandwiches what Olive Garden does to italian food. smother it in buckets of butter and fool people into thinking it's flavor. It's not - it's a greasy visual treat that triggers the body's instinctual need for fat as insulation and makes me regret waiting in line to the point I start understanding the plight of Ethiopians. Hype works, unfortunately...4 times for me til I called it quits.   I borderline hate this place except the really awesome coleslaw which always tastes like the first time you tasted it, then it spanks you for forgetting. I also like the chalk board drawings. Hate the hipsters swarming here that stylized their insecurity with the \"cons with intellectual depth\" look. I don't want my food served to me by someone that still has yet to figure themself out, at 29. But what do I know - I'm the Clevelander that is too unhip to like Melt. I will say though, that you get a luxurious amount of food for a very good price. And for that, you're twice as star-worthy as White Castle."}
{"text":"The picture pretty much says it all. I at a heart attack on a plate, washed it down with a beer, and didn't eat dinner that night. And loved it. I hit up the Independence location for lunch on a random Monday by myself (business travel, not Total Loser. I swear.) I started with the mini pierogies, which were delicious and served atop cabbage with slight searing. I'd get those again anytime. Unfortunately, they ruined my dinner! Why? For a main I chose the Monte Cristo, a deep-fried grilled cheese with multiple meats, multiple cheeses. It was so much, so rich, so flavorful, that I couldn't finish it, fell into a food coma most of the afternoon, and never ate dinner that night. Yes, this is food worth starving yourself for. Unique, filling, and YUM. They also had a great on-tap beer selection, and the bartender was very knowledgeable, providing excellent recommendations to pair with my food bomb. Decor is neon, inflatable stuff, TVs, and other random stuff. Echo previous reviewer... wish there were one of these in Raleigh."}
{"text":"I realize that there are people out there who think this is an overrated restaurant, but maybe they're not getting the right thing. The god father is my absolute favorite! I love trying the sandwich of the month though. This past visit I tried the chicken and waffle melt...to die for! It had just the right amount of savory and sweet. The chicken was so tender and not at all hard to bite through. Pared with the waffle and butter, it was just fantastic. Not to mention the delicious jalapeño syrup for dipping. Just a delightful combination.   I also had a few bites of the new bomb turkey. Obviously I was so involved with my own melt to have any interest in this one, but it was just another example of how well they put together flavors that compliment each other. The perfect sandwich to give you a taste of Thanksgiving!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing. I got the breakfast sandwich and holy fuck was it amazing! I couldn't eat for like 2 days after it but so worth every sinful bite!"}
{"text":"Cuban War Pig, The Dude Abides, Godfather. These are modern classics. Opening on a plate near you.  Melt never fails to make me wish I hadn't driven myself there, so that I could just happily doze off in the back seat after stuffing my stomach to maximum capacity (and then some). While I have yet to achieve the greatest feat of all, and that is to finish my Melt sandwich in one sitting, I would not recommend it, nor do I think it is wise. Melt is one of those rare establishments, whose food is just as good the next day.   These sandwiches are beasts of flavor that make bold statements both to your eyes and to your belly. I think they do a surprisingly good job of actually making the sandwiches feel and taste like sandwiches and yet also like the meal that is being stuffed into them. For example, with the Godfather, I feel like I'm enjoying a wonderful lasagna, and yet I also am enjoying an explosion of a sandwich. It's so tricky and so marvelous. Cuban War Pig is sweet and tangy and just sooo saucy, you'll need lots of napkins! The Dude Abides is cozy and very satisfying. It tastes like homemade meatballs, and yet so much better. It makes me feel like I've known those meatballs my whole life lol.   Since Melt is so amazing, expect long wait times. My best advice is to call ahead with your order and pick up your food to go. These beauties should probably be enjoyed on your couch with a pair of large sweatpants. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Massive portions. Delicious food. The only downside is they don't take reservations so the wait can get long."}
{"text":"Yum. Fabulous, original sandwiches.  Quality bread, through to cheese and other extraneous fillings.  Quality beer, and lots of it.  Our server was friendly.  Our wait was probably about what the hostess said it would be ~20 minutes at 8 on a Sunday night.    Downsides weren't significant enough to take off a star, but here they are.. Inefficient use of space - tables seem to be arranged rather oddly, and it felt like they should have tried to shove a few more in.  I could see things getting waaaaaay slow in here at busier times because there really just don't seem to be that many tables.  Erratic beer menu - what they have is great, but it's kinda all over the place and seems a little imbalanced.  Heavy on lagers, quite a number of IPAs, lots of wheats, and 3 or 4 stouts & porters.  Yes it's summer, yes those are heavy beers, but ... I like a nice dark beer in July almost as much as I do in January."}
{"text":"Hey, at 4-stars and 291 reviews, there's not much left to say, but for good measure, I just gotta say this place is so legit. The Monte Cristo + pear cider is my jam, and it's superb every time. If you go any time between 5:30 and close, expect a 30-minute wait. Late afternoon affords you the great food, plus no wait and more attentive service. All-around one of my favorite Lakewood restaurants."}
{"text":"We've been to the Cleveland Heights melt twice. Both times we waited a minimum of 30 minutes, but the wait times were overshadowed by the impressive beer selection, quick and friendly service and excellent food. The portion size makes for a great value (including next day's lunch)."}
{"text":"What do you think of when you watch an episode of Man v Food.  Stomach ache?  Well the thought of eating a fancy grilled cheese does sound.  This brings me back to the memories I had when I was little kid and my sophistication was very limited to a basic grilled cheese.  I want to thank to Man v Food for the long wait, actually I'm one of those non locals that normally cause the JAM around here.   I walked in and noticed the bar takes up half of this place and the dining area took up another half.  No wonder there is always a wait here!!!  I sat at the Bar for an hour and the place had a HIPSTER feel for Cleveland standards.  The bartender was very attentive considering the crowd and prices for their beers were very reasonable with most of the beers running at $4.  They had a very big drink list with a variety of craft beers and imports.  I decided on New Hollad Ichabod. That HIT THE SPOT!!!   I looked at the Menu and stared at the Melt challenge.  You basically have to devour over 5lbs of food that includes 13 different cheeses, 3 slices of grilled bread and a pile of hand-cut fries & slaw WITHOUT ANY RESTROOM BREAKS.  I passed.  I split the Monte Cristo ($10) and THE Cleveland cheese steak ($11.50).  When they served it up it was a lot bigger than I imagined it to be.  The bread slices are almost 2 inches thick and there is a LOT of melted cheese (you have plenty to choose from)!!!  For my taste, the cheese was a little too overpowering and there was too much bread.   I have a big appetite and I couldn't even finish the meal.  I felt like such a sissy!!!   Would I come back? Yes but I would be more cautious on what I order.   There is TOO MUCH cheese and bread for my taste, but I like the service, the crowd, and the alcohol selection."}
{"text":"honestly, you can never go wrong with a meal at melt! the atmosphere is modern and funky. the holiday decor is mirrored at each location and keeps the visit fun. my go to meal is always  The Dude sandwhich, but this trip was specifically for the seasonal sandwhich, The Melt Pig Roast sandwhich. Wow, from the succulent pork loin, to the sweet, spicy BBQ sauce. to finish the meal , we had the s'mores bread pudding. that has to be, hands down, the BEST Melt dessert of them all! The only negative at the Independence location was the huge lapse in time waiting for our meal. For an early Saturday evening meal, the wait for food was over a half an hour. the only reason a one star deduction."}
{"text":"Melt is one of those restaurants that put Cleveland on the culinary hit list. I've met people from all over who ask, \"You're from Cleveland? Have you been to Melt?\" For that, I want to give Melt and Matt Fish 5 stars!   WHY I HAD TO KNOCKOFF TWO STARS: 1) Long waits = More $$$ - An hour long wait for a grilled cheese sandwich?! You are bound to try a couple beers and these ain't no $2 Black Labels. A couple craft beers and microbrews add up. 2) While I find the monthly sandwich specials fun and inventive they tend to be a bit outrageous. I'd take tasty over crazy any day. 3) The recovery time! You just ate two pounds of delicious melted cheese wedged between butter soaked bread, you will be in a food coma for at least an hour.  With that being said, maybe my nostalgia for my local grilled cheese haunt has worn off but, that doesn't mean I don't recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with Melt.  Great food, great craft beer and soda menu and always friendly service.  My personal favorites are the Tokyo Tuna and Parma, Italy. Everything on the menu is worth at least one try.  Just be prepared for a wait no matter the day or time.  Usually the wait is around and hour I will credit the staff on trying to keep things moving as quickly as possible without ever rushing any of the customers."}
{"text":"Yum! Always go for the new special sandwiches!!! :) and don't forget the vegetable of the day, always a delight!"}
{"text":"I like it, but I don't think it's worth the two hour wait they ALWAYS have. I usually put my name in and then go back home to hang out for an hour and a half (don't tell them you're leaving and then coming back, they don't like that). Or, you can always try to grab a seat at the bar that's first come first serve. It is an extremely small space, so when you get a table in the front of the dining area, they people that are waiting for a table are basically standing next to you. Love the extra dinner guests (not).  Aside from that, the food is very good, and if you're going to be eating here, eat very lightly during the day because it will surely put you WAY about your daily calorie count. The fries are awesome, and they give you a decent amount. It you want something not too crazy and different, go for the melt burger--that is, if they still have it. I haven't been there since they have made a new menu. It looks like they have gotten rid of my favorite- the Cleveland Municipal Stadium, which had really awesome vodka kraut on it. If you're gonna do an appetizer, do the perogies.  If you want to try out the place, refer back to my first paragraph: be prepared to wait!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time we been here.. if in Cleveland stop here, it's awesome !  And so are the portions.."}
{"text":"Melt is amazing.  There are signature sandwiches but you can also create you own.  I selected the Westside Monte Cristo - a combo of ham, turkey, cheese that is battered and fried.  As any good 'cristo, it is served with preservative.  O-M-G it was heavenly.    Be warned!  You are getting a crazy large amount of food.  Each sandwich is served with an amazing tomato soup and a side.  If that wasn't enough, you are also given goldfish crackers to accompany your soup!   If I am ever back in Cleveland, I'll be sure to hit Melt up."}
{"text":"In Cleveland part time, Detroit the rest,, We went here yesterday for dinner, it was excellent ! Innovative menu, Had the meatloaf and a couple drinks, we all enjoyed it immensely. Service was friendly and prompt. You need to open in Detroit ! Perfect demographics for you, , exploding restaurant scene downtown and midtown,  You will make a million ! There is nothing like Melt there,  Melt  Is a great place for a wonderful fun food experience."}
{"text":"Crazy good and filling.  Not the most healthy meal but look at the menu and tell me you could resist a visit.  So many delicious options.  There will likely be a wait but the kitchen and servers are always hoppin' so it shouldn't take long to be seated."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Friends took me here on a visit to Cleveland, and it was definitely a win. The sandwiches were HUGE...two meals worth, at least. We had an order of pierogi, which was super tasty, and I tried the curry chicken sandwich. Line was long, so we just sat at the bar and had really great service. It was a pretty heavy meal, but definitely worth doing every once in a while!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the clientele left something to be desired. My colleagues and I went here for an Anthropological conference and were met by some very racist attitudes of fellow diners. In particular, one red headed fellow, who kept screaming about African American penises. The manager nicely managed to clear things up but I don't want to dine at an establishment which allows such riff raff."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where I heard about Melt from...maybe it was on Man V Food or maybe it was DDD... Either way I decided to hit this place up on my way out of Cleveland the other day. Boy am I glad I stopped.   I got to Melt at about 11:45AM on a Tuesday. I walked in and was told that there was a 45 minute wait for a table! On a Tuesday?!?! At 11:45?!?! I decided to sit at the bar.   I ordered the soup of the day to start, Buffalo Chicken Chowder. It came out immediately and it was served in a coffee mug that said \"New Mommy\". Nice touch. The soup was awesome! Very spicy (as to be expected), but also very tasty. It was loaded with chicken, banana peppers and celery.   I was really at a loss when ordering my sandwich. I'm not from the area and I wasn't sure if or when I was going to make it back so I wanted to make this time count. The bartender was helpful and I eventually decided on The Parmageddon. How can you go wrong with a sandwich that has pierogi and sauerkraut?! You can't! It was awesome. Very very good. It was served with fries (they were alright) and \"sweet slaw\" (which was not).   The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was that it took FOREVER to get my sandwich. Like I said the soup was out in a hurry, but I didn't get my sandwich until like 45 minutes later. I literally had to feed the meter twice (which is another minus. Why no free parking???)."}
{"text":"Soo......good!  I always get the full sandwich and take it home for leftovers the next day. Chicken Parmesan, Meatloaf, Summer Chicken, so many choices, so little time!  Took an out of town friend there for \"grilled cheese\" and she is still raving about it over a year later."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, I have tried almost everything on the menu at this point and have yet to be disappointed. They have monthly specials, my favorite being the mighty macaroni melt. You can customize almost anything to your liking, but I have found one of there long time bartenders (sadly I don't know his name) gives wonderful suggestions.   The drawback is, as others have said, the wait but it's a small place so there's not much that can be done about it, but it's worth waiting for! Most of the lot is paid parking too, so bring change. The staff is always friendly, it has a fun atmosphere, love it all around! Oh but be prepared for the food coma that will follow a meal here, it's one of the few places where I just can't stop myself from over eating."}
{"text":"I love Melt! Their huge, greasy sandwiches, delicious French fries, and great beer selection will cure even the nastiest of hangovers. You will always leave here feeling completely stuffed, but so satisfied. I have never been to any of the other Melt locations, so I can only speak for this one when I say that no matter what you order, you will love it! I've made it a sort of mission to try as many of the sandwiches as I can, so every time I go I try to get something different. My absolute favorite will always be the buffalo chicken. However, the backyard BBQ and the cheesesteak sandwiches are also fantastic. Their fries are delicious and they definitely give you enough food for 2-3 meals. Although they now offer half sandwiches, the price difference is not enough for me to get anything but the full. This place is also great if you are vegetarian or vegan! My mom is a vegetarian and it is always hard to find somewhere that we both love to eat, but Melt is one of those places. Most of their sandwiches have vegetarian or vegan options to please everyone. They also have more than just grilled cheese. They always have a soup and side of the day, they have delicious looking salads, and other menu items as well. So no matter what you're looking for, you'll find it here!"}
{"text":"I've driven an hour-plus out of my way just to get a sandwich more times than I'd like to admit.  Melt offers a really interesting take on already delicious comfort food.  The Dude Abides is my favorite sandwich, period.  It's such a dense sandwich packed with flavor and texture that makes it irresistible.    There have been rumblings of a Pittsburgh location opening at some point, which would be heaven.  Though maybe it's better for my arteries if I have to go to go to Ohio for Melt."}
{"text":"If you ever eat here and wonder why your obese it's because they will literally fuck anything you want into your sandwich.  Deep fried pulled pork, no problem.  A gang bang of mozzarella wedges, done.  Bukkake that bitch in ranch and you're in business.  Everytime my girl and I wanna go there we say we are gonna split a sandwich it never happens.  It's delicious and I always take the other half to my brother, he's overweight too.  The fries are really good, hand cut and deep fried proper.  Dont forget your heart pills before you go."}
{"text":"Don't go to melt unless you want to be stuffed and fat! Monthly sandwich specials! Interesting hipster servers and decor. Always a decent or no wait at the Mentor location.  If you're a judgy person who hates fun and too many carbs, go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Austin, this place was recommended by a friend.  One of my all time favorite places now!  Incredible, big food.  Incredible service.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"Fun place to try for out of towners. I do think the quality of the food has gone down compared to a few years ago. For instance, the bomb turkey and teenage mutant turtle pizza roll melt don't  taste the same as they used to, and that is dissapointing.  I feel like they changed the recipe to make it easier on themselves. Maybe they are making more things ahead of time now.  I don't really know. But if you are an out of towner you dont really have the advantage of my years of eating these sandwiches to know that so you will probably think everything is amazing.   I do like to try the new sandwiches. But my favorites are the big popper and the (old) bomb turkey.   I do have to say their customer service rocks. For take out and in house.  I like to sit at the bar. It's really chill and the bartenders are great. Im really into their Mixed drinks. Very good. I love it when things are muddled and their cocktails have a certain degree of muddling and always taste great. Late at night after  the kitchen closes, this is a great place to hang out. Probably the coolest ambiance in lakewood for a drink at night. And the younger drunk crowd is non existent here.  So that's cool. Its a good place to catch up with a friend or have a date or just relax by yourself."}
{"text":"melt is the best!  every time i visit cleveland i make it a point to go there as many times as possible.  i love the beer selection!  the bartenders are super nice, especially Steve, who on my first visit recommended the Left Hand Brewing Company Nitro Milk Stout which has since become my favorite beer.  It's a shame that a brewery located in Colorado doesn't distribute to my home state of California yet I've come across Left Hand even as far as Boston.  bummer.    of course, i've never seen so many grilled cheese varieties EVER.  my favorite is the municipal stadium which has bratwurst, sauer kraut, grilled peppers, and american cheese.  yum...  and it's reasonably priced.  bonus.  all of my clevelander friends and family always complain about the ridiculous wait times there, but i've actually never had a problem.  even at their busiest, i was able to walk up to the bar and get a seat and order off of the full menu.   i even went so far as to get a tattoo of a melt grilled cheese so that i could be in the tattoo family.  25% off for life!  too bad i live 2500 miles away, but i will be back in ohio soon enough to visit my family, and to visit melt."}
{"text":"I am mixed about Melt. I really really wanted to love this place, but the parking at this location sucks, the employees are hipsters that think they are to good for you  and there was hardly any tables in the place. Wait times were high. Maybe it was just the bartender we had, but she was nasty and seemed to hate life. I def would not go out of my way to go back.  The reason for 3stars is 1 star is for the concept of the restaurant and the decor. I liked it, very different and had a unique feel.  Another star was for the menu, They have so pretty awesome grilled cheese sandwiches and FRESH CUT fries.   And another star because I feel it deserves more than 2.  But just for the record  the employees of this place def ruined my experience, felt uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Delicioussss. Definitely not the healthiest but still yum. Many vegetarian / vegan options. Favs so far at the peanut butter banana and the vegan good burger! If you're looking to dine in you're looking at a good long wait for a table. Best to order take out from here honestly just because of how ridiculously busy this place is. Pictures are of the vegan good burger."}
{"text":"We saw this place on the morning news while getting ready to go to cedar point. Decided to try it out on our way to the airport in Cleveland. Definitely not disappointed! The food was awesome and the bartender was super friendly. Definitely recommend the Buffalo chicken and the Cuban war pig grilled cheeses. Too bad we dont live here so we can't sample more! They also have gluten free which is a plus :)"}
{"text":"I love Melt.  No trip to Cleveland is complete for me without enjoying a gooey grilled cheese and a craft beer.  I've been here a handful of times.  It is filling and over the top, but I just love it.  My favorite is the Fried Green Tomato BLT.  It is always a welcome treat.  I love the fries with malt vinegar (seasoned to perfection).  The service is always quite good and they have a great selection of beer.  If I lived in Cleveland I would probably be here all the time!"}
{"text":"I got the pleasure of eating at Melt during a recent work trip to Cleveland.  All I can say is wow.  Juicy, drippy, yummy grilled cheeses.  I was trying to be healthy (bad place to try to be healthy) so I ordered the Purple Parma.  Little did I know that this sandwich was two fried pieces of eggplant covered in cheese and marinara served up with yummy friens and cole slaw.  It was delicious.  I was there with my boss, who ordered The Godfather, which is lasagna on a sandwich.  That's right - Lasagna.  On a sandwich.  Great beer selection, as well - I had the Pumking.  I will definitely come back next time I'm in Cleveland.  The only reason I didn't 5 star this place - I felt pretty yucky afterwards from all the grease!"}
{"text":"Went into the Cleveland Heights location last night. The evening started out well enough but shortly after we placed our order at the bar it started to go downhill. Our server became less and less attentive to us but did manage to pay lots of attention to the patrons on either side of us, to the point where we would ask him for something and he would proceed to do something for them and then do some busy work before he got around to us again, usually forgetting altogether what we had asked him for. The final straw was when he took our credit cards to cash us out then set them down on the other side of the bar where we could no longer see them and proceeded to make drinks and do busy work cleaning up the bar for at least 10 minutes before another bartender saw our cards, ran them and brought them back to us. The worst part is that when we spoke to the manager about this her only response was \"sorry that happened, I'll have to talk to him.\" I've had excellent service here before and this was just such atrocious service from Caspian and Jen that I'll reconsider the next time I think about eating at Melt."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place! Our only issue is our eyes are bigger then our stomachs. I love the chicken and waffle sandwich but highly recommend only doing half of the order."}
{"text":"Great, creative menu choices. Food is good but they give you a LOT of it so it's hard to finish and you can feel sick afterwards if you eat too much. Good ambiance and it looks like they have a good selection of drinks. The only reason why they're not getting four stars is because the individual parts of the sandwiches can be a bit meh, but add up to an overall good eating experience."}
{"text":"Wow! The jalapeño poppers was amazing, by far my favorite! The chicken and waffles were great (part of my chicken batter was a little doughy), the fried green tomato was great! The peanut butter banana was super messy and not that great. The peeeech beverage was really good!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try melt out our service at Easton was horrible took over 40 minutes to get our dinner and it wasn't packed. Second part our server didn't seem to be very attentive didn't pay attention that we had no drinks never came back to check on her table never came back to tell us our food was going to be late nothing. I was so looking forward to this and the food was not very good are french fries had to go back cuz they were cold. Very very very"}
{"text":"I ordered the cheesesteak and all I tasted was salt between two pieces of greasy bread.  Gross!  Meat was flavorless-all you tasted was salt.  I'll stick with the summer chicken from now on, which is excellent. The chorizo and potato is good, the purple Parma is good, the big popper is good (warning-it's so greasy you'll want to throw up after), the fries were seasoned nicely, and the slaw was good at this location.   We arrived at 4:30pm, there was no wait.  (Lakewood location is a whole other ballpark!) I ordered a zombie cocktail and it was gross; no flavor except for vodka (supposed to have rums).  I get this cocktail at other places and it's always the same; not sure what was in this one.  Server was cool, not smiley, but nice and on the ball.  Kitchen took forever as they usually do, but the food was super hot upon arrival, which almost never occurs at the Lakewood location.   Our friends said, \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Why not, I'm making Melt my 50th review.  I'm still a little hung over from the weekend and was going through reviews and finding new friends when I noticed Melt and thought to my self, that sounds pretty damn good right now.  I also suggest reading the other reviews, these people on Yelp know what they are talking about.    Only things that rubbed me the wrong way about Melt and by no means will this prevent me from going back were the following.  1) Wait (service)-Gotcha, but when the first thing that the hostess says is that it will be more then an hour just so you know, instead of hi, welcome to Melt, that kind of bothered me.  Did get a spot at the bar in 45 minutes and waited another 45 for food.  No biggie, already forgotten.  2) Food - Food was good to really good.  I went with the special of the month.  One of the pieces of bread was the ass end of the loaf and didn't over up my sandwich, not to mention they cut it extremely thick which made it a little chewy.  Really was hoping for some Au Jus but didn't get it.  We also ordered Ahi Tuna app that never even came out to the bar, this left us a little pissy too.  They didn't charge, no biggie.  3) Checking out- We waited another 20 minutes or so for our check.  We were trying to make room for other people but no go, once again we were left waiting.  Like I said before, these are the only things that p'd me off but I have the patience of a Saint so I'll go back especially for the spicy cole slaw, that was a nice surprise.  I'll probably go with the Monte next time or the straight up grilled cheese.  Solid 4 stars, must try, I know the owners read all the reviews they find online, I just hope they follow through and your experience is a little better then mine."}
{"text":"So ok. It's famous now because it was on Man v. Food. That's cool. And although many places raise their prices after such recognition, they seem not to have done so. That's also cool.   Beer selection - very cool/huge.  Decor/atmosphere is awesome - tons of Cleveland nostalgia - when I was there once they were playing Major League on the TV (juuuuuuuust a bit outside!).  A fun place for sure.   The food is really good -  I've had a few of their different grilled cheese offerings and they've all been great. The fries and slaw that comes with the sandwiches are good too. I know some people say the burger was gross but you know, that's kind of like ordering a steak at IHOP. Order what they're known for and you won't be disappointed.   The only downside to this place is the wait. DO NOT go there on any night if you are starving. You will wait a decent amount (like an hour or more if they're busy) for your table. After that, you still will wait at least a half hour-45 min for your food.   The first time I went, shortly after the eastside location opened - we waited for nearly 3 hours door-to-food time (we sat at a table that time). Recently, though, we went at about 1pm for lunch and found a couple of barstools within 10 minutes.   The thing about this place is that there is more bar seating than table seating and the bar turns over MUCH faster. I recommend the bar seating if at all possible. Put your name on the list for a table, grab some beers, and then keep on the lookout for bar stools. Chances are you'll be able to snag some spots.   You KNOW about the wait. If you've read some reviews, you can't say you weren't warned. Don't go there starving especially if you've got your heart set on a table.  But the food is damn good so go early, have a beer and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is great! A lot of fun. They have a lot of different sandwiches that are always delicious and they have different menus for different times of the year. They usually have a great special sandwich for every month. Also if you're there try the Buffalo chicken soup it is amazing!"}
{"text":"OK,  here it is.   This review is for the three Melt restaurants I have been to (Lakewood,  Mentor and independence).   My first trip to the Lakewood Melt I took the Melt challenge and lost terribly.   The sandwich had good moments,  but an equal number of bad ones as well.    Flash forward a couple months and I visited the Independence Melt.   Waited an hour and tried their sandwich of the month which happened to taste great,  or at least for the first pound of sandwich.   After that,  it became a chore to finish and it had lost some of its luster.   Could I have gotten a to-go box?  Nah,  day old grilled cheese is not an attractive option.   I left stuffed and out $20 for a sandwich and soda.  Last visit was Mentor.   We noticed a trend,  make people wait even with many open tables.   It was our guess they did this to 1) create a buzz 2) make people hungrier and thirstier so they order more.  But I digress....  I opted for the eggplant sandwich and it was a huge mistake.   The bread and cheese were okay,  but the eggplant was the worst pre-frozen eggplant I've ever eaten.    I was also upset that there were six or seven empty tables,  yet entire families were forced to wait (with some sitting on the floor) in the lobby.    Bottom line,  this restaurant supplies terribly unhealthy food and provides lukewarm service,  all at a fairly high cost.   In the end,  I see this restaurant slowly playing out,  collapsing under the weight of its own ego.   Maybe I'm a dick,  maybe I don't get it, maybe I just should have ordered the Parmageddon instead,  but I really would be shocked if I ever returned."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed. The sandwiches are made with fresh ingredients and the service is excellent even on busy days. They have a seasonal menu and an option to build your own sandwich. Anything I have ever had has been excellent.  It can get very busy at times and there is a wait for a table, but I can usually get a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for a couple years now, and I finally made the trip from Pittsburgh to dine on a delicious Melt sammich!  Though the sandwiches were amazing, I think my favorite piece of food I ate was the Buffaloed Tofu!  I have never heard or seen such a thing nor have I ever though I would say I enjoyed tofu.  It was amazing!!! You have got to try it!  I think right now I would take an order of those over a plate of real chicken wings!  I decided to go big and get their new Rising Sun Melt.  It was packed with shrimp, kimchi pickles, shallots, field greens, and of course Munster cheese.  It was absolutley phenomenal!  The bread was mouth watering too.  Did I mention that the huge sandwich also comes with a heaping pile of fries and coleslaw??  Amazing..  Oh yeah, the decor and atmosphere of this place is unlike any other place I have ever been to.  It is like a constant party here.  I would drive the 2 hours right now for another Melt meal in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This was our first night in the Cleveland area on June 28, 2017. We thought we would try a local eatery and picked one that served BBQ. Always fun to compare our pallet for BBQ with that which has treated us well in the KC area. So off we went at 6pm. But when we arrived, it was closed with a sign that said sold out. Good news, bad news. So we opted for another local, Melt.  We arrived around 6:30 and were seated quickly. Drinks ordered and arrived promptly too. But what to eat since everything on the menu was different. Almost went for the Monte Christo. Should have gone for the Monte Christo, but opted for the 1/2 Mighty Macaroni with slaw as the side. The Yelp pictures of the sandwich looked so good and creamy as does they menu online. My spouse opted for the 1/2 Mushroom Melt and kettle chips. Liked the holiday related decor and the noise level enabled us to talk to each other very easily.  Sandwiches arrived in a reasonable amount of time but mine didn't look anything like the picture on their menu or in my head. The mac n cheese was fried, but it was just a block of mac and not the ozzing cheese anticipated. Mine tasted ok, but very dry. On the other hand, my wife's mushroom melt was very good, so a 50% hit. Took one bit of the slaw, and my mouth was burning. Never had very spicy slaw. Also wasn't warned that it would be spicy, so maybe this is the norm in this part of the country. On the other hand, my wife's chips were very good.   Overall, my meal wasn't what was expected, therefore the resulting rating. My wife's was very good, therefore the mixed review. On to another local eatery tonight, but won't go back to a Melt when in the part of the country."}
{"text":"I love cheese. I love grilled cheese. Even with those two phrases, I don't think I will ever try the grilled cheese challenge. Despite that, they have other selections which I absolutely love the Spinach Pie (well, to be honest, I love spinach and feta anything) as well as the Blackened Chicken. Definitely worth a stop if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is worth all the hype. Sandwiches bigger than your head and fries seasoned by the gods. They serve full and half sandwiches, which is great because even the half sandwich will make the button on your jeans pop off. Prices aren't bad either! Half sandwiches range from 9-13$. The atmosphere is like a hipster version of TGIF, and I'm alright with that. They do get super busy though, so try and go for an early dinner or around lunch time."}
{"text":"Are you  DEEF? Why is the music so loud? Can't even talk to person across my table without screaming"}
{"text":"Grilled cheese is my go to food and this place rocked!!! It was a great atmosphere with tons of nostalgic items to keep your mind busy waiting for your food. We sat at the bar where the local beer choices were plentiful and servers were amazing.   But that grilled cheese sandwich with turkey, stuffing, cranberries and butternut squash was better than any Thanksgiving I can remember. This is a must. Especially if you have in sweats to expand the waistline."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the melt locations since my first visit to the original Lakewood spot years ago. The atmosphere is trendy and is usually more appealing to the 20-30 something's. I have never had a bad experience at a Melt and this new location is no different. For those that have never been, expect to wait, order a drink from the amazing craft beer menu and chill out. A table or a seat at the bar will be yours in usually less than an hour. Seating moves faster than stated usually. The menu is great and has some humor built in to the titles. They also cater to the vegetarian/vegan crowd too. Personally the summer and winter chicken are my faves. He says the dude abides and wake and bacon are his. There is a sandwich for everyone, just wait your turn to find out. The service at the new mentor spot was great for being the second night open and I am pretty sure that was owner Matt, expediting the kitchen line as the orders came out."}
{"text":"I don't see how others cannot like this place. This is a Cleveland original that has blown up and if you are visiting Cleveland, you must stop here. I understand the place is small and the wait times can be long, but have a seat at the bar and enjoy their awesome beer selection for a while before food. I strongly suggest the winter and summer chicken. I always get one of those when I go, and I looove the vinegary peppery coleslaw that they serve. He likes about every thing he tries but the Waken Bacon is his fave. Huge sandwiches, quality ingredients, prepared well, great atmosphere, and great beer selection. You've just got to try it for yourself...oh and the bar is full service...so if you find a seat, stay and eat!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was laughably terrible.  My band is on tour with a band visiting from Japan we have some vegans with us and were told to make an out of the way stop here. We arrive immediately the hostess is blubbering and unable to comprehend a very simple order change. Three different people came over not able to help and suggested I just buy a separate item on the menu and give the item I didnt want \"to a friend\". LOL ok great thanks.  Then we ordered vegan food which is heavily advertised on their menu and the vegan grilled cheese came w. No  vegan cheese. We then had to purchase the vegan cheese as a side, which we had to put on the sandwich ourselves.  They were rude and not helpful at all. And immediately after giving us our food which we were still assembling they said \"oh you can't eat food to go here\" literally assembling the food I just paid for you to make me. THANKS FOR THE VENT SESH YELP. Melt is meh. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Melt is our go to pig out place.  Fantastic food, great beers, super service, awesome environment.  There's something for everyone here.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible customer service! Incompetent and rude bartender and even more rude manager! Obviously no one there has heard the phrase 'the customer is always right' or has ever learned to smile. Will not return to the Lakewood location ever again!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times, and I must say, Melt is a fun place. My favorite is the mighty mac, which is a comically large brick of fried mac n cheese, topped with more cheese, on the best toast you've ever had. This past week, though, service was really off. From our waitress who we almost never saw (they weren't crowded), to a bartender who made it awkward when we tried to get a second round of drinks before the end of happy hour. Yes sir, I know I can order from my waitress; but we haven't seen her in 30 minutes. Please take my money...  Anyway, once the novelty of a huge, variegated grilled cheese menu wears off, there is little that sets this place apart. Go just once to say you did, then commit to going somewhere better next time."}
{"text":"Another overrated Cleveland restaurant. Sub par grilled cheese big effing deal. I don't get the fools who are constantly raving about this place like its the greatest thing since sliced bread. I could make a better grilled cheese at home any day and not have to wait 3 freakin hours to get it. The only good thing about this place is the decor and the fact that I met the love of my life there."}
{"text":"So this was my first time at this place. I'm not sure if they take reservations or not, I didn't ask. But if they do- make them! We got there and they said it would be an hour wait- ugh. The place was packed. It was a Saturday night so I get it. So I guess I don't advise just walking in and expecting to be seated right away lol   So, we decided to get some drinks since we'd be waiting a while. No seats at the bar either so we had to just order and walk away and stand in the waiting area. Bartenders took a little long to acknowledge us, but again- I get it, it was a busy night. And anyway what made me smile was the price on a round of drinks. 4 drinks and it was 19 bucks! Booyaa! That was nice. So-we waited in the area where they call your name when the table is ready. We really did wait about an hour to be seated. In the meantime though I do recommend getting a drink and trying to scoot away in a corner though and stay out of the way of the people traffic. Enjoy the cool decorations, drawings on the walls, and lights hanging up in the meantime. I also loved the fact that they had a huge donation piggy! They had a sign up to donate for an animal cause- which I had to contribute to! I love animals :-)   So on to the service and food. The service was great. Had a good attentive waiter who came to check on us multiple times. Always had a smile on his face too. I think he said his name was Levy. Very cool guy.   So the food. The food was very delicious! They have the option of getting a whole sandwhich or a half. I wanted to share my sandwich so I got a whole one and my fiancé got a whole one so he could share his with me. This sounded like a good idea until the food arrived lol Holy moly- the sandwhiches are huge! I barely made it through half of my own lol I got the monte Cristo sandwich and it was delicious! He got the Mac and cheese one which was also delicious. You are definitely getting what you pay for here lol Ended up leaving with a lot of left overs haha No way could I finish that haha And the bill was 78 bucks for 5 adults and 2 kids! What?! Lol that's crazy! I guess I'm just used to paying 78 bucks for TWO people in NYC lol So that was awesome!   Overall- stop in here if you get the chance! :-)"}
{"text":"The Cuban melt is my favorite so far (get it with honey mustard instead of brown). I've also had the Monte Criso which was the shiz and the Rising Sun melt, which I was not such a huge fan of. I once ordered the blackened chicken salad and it was KIND OF AMAZING. You could actually taste that the chicken was grilled and the combination of bleu cheese crumbles and crispy onion straws was definately something to write home about. Also, the fries are an experience; order a side of Russian dressing to dip them in. Trust me."}
{"text":"Have always loved melt and gone there for years, but the last time was very disappointed. The quality of the sandwiches and ingredients has decreased . the portions also decreased in size as well. Along with no slaw anymore. Still worth going for unique experience, but I will find other places."}
{"text":"Do you like sandwiches???  I don't think it gets better than this place.  I ordered the fried green tomato sandwich and I still dream about it.  YUM-O"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. The sandwiches are unbelievable and the fried macaroni and cheese is the best I have ever had. They have an amazing beer selection. If you are going here on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait. The wait is worth the food. My recommendations for sandwiches are The Dude Abides (meatball with Mozzarella stick), the Parmagetton (Pierogi Sandwich) or the Chicken and Waffles.  No trip to Cleveland is complete without a visit to Melt."}
{"text":"Melt Bar and Grilled of Cleveland Heights is top-notch! Took some friends who had never been there recently and they positively raved about it afterwards. They have a huge food menu, and a huge drink menu (with pear cider!) so it's impossible to go wrong. They also have monthly and sometimes weekly specials that are definitely worth a try. They even seem willing to accept substitutions--I've even had the servers suggest some delicious-sounding modifications.   I would recommend that you be fully prepared to get a seat at the bar and wait for a table. You can enjoy a beverage (or several) and maybe an appetizer. The bar is full service as well so you can eat there if the wait is too long for you. Bartenders and servers are helpful and cheerful, even late in the evening.   The only thing I'm not in love with is the coleslaw, but the sandwich you get is essentially a meal in itself. The fries and appetizers are decent. But I can't say enough good things about the grilled cheese! I'm so glad they brought this place over to the East Side--the short trip makes it that much more delicious."}
{"text":"Went to Melt on a recent trip to Cleveland. I could not have been happier with the meal. Melt has a very nice beer selection and the sandwiches are amazing. I ordered The Dude Abides (homemade meatballs, fried mozzarella cheese sticks, rich marinara, provolone & romano) and it was perfect.   Our waiter was very friendly and a few people at the table made substitutions without any problems.  I would recommend to anyone in Cleveland or visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great Food, Environment, and Ambience.  TVs for Sports Fans and TVs for Children as well. Winner!"}
{"text":"We stopped by around 2 pm on a sunday and were seated immediately. You can pretty much have any style grilled cheese that you'd like. There are very large portions. The fries are also good too. the restaurant is decorated with halloween and Christmas display lights. Theres not a lot of seating and the tables are close together. You also can look into the kitchen as you eat."}
{"text":"We have waited for this for a long time! We have driven from Avon to Lakewood for 2 years for Melt about 1-5 times a month. This is by far the best Melt of all 10. It is clean, bright, and the \"classiest\" one. It is still Melt, but a little more upscale. They have a large waiting area and seating/takeout order desk, a humongous waiting area with a mural coming soon, a huge bar, plenty of indoor seating, a small outdoor patio, and a huge 4 season room equipped with garage doors. They did a good job with this newer building (2015) previously occupied by Bar 145. They used the nice building, but made it their own. The food was the same as the others, and the staff were friendly, but these things could very well change over time. We will definitely be back soon!! We love the convenience, easy parking, and proximity from our current home. Thanks to Matt Fish for bringing Melt to the West-Westside of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Three words:   YUMMY.  Angio.   Plasty."}
{"text":"Every time we come to melt we have a wait. However, it is always worth the wait. The food is so good, with every penny. And the servers are right on it, we have never had an empty glass here. I love it."}
{"text":"Really great vegan reuben.  Only reason 4/5 is that I told the staff repeatedly I was vegan and my salad came with eggs on it.  No biggie.  Great food n beers."}
{"text":"I can not believe how bad this whole experience was!  TERRIBLE service, workers who could not care any less and a final price for our order that left us with the impression to eat at a restaurant or elsewhere!         Where to start with this unbelievably awful service and low quality experience?  It was a Tuesday afternoon this past week and three of us nearly completed a massive yard work and landscaping job on your friends yard in Lakewood.  We wanted to try something different for lunch.  We decided on Melt Bar and Grill.  The three of us looked at their online menu which feels so clustered together and not one item had a picture!  We still managed to figure out what we wanted for take out.  This is when Melt's terrible and careless service started.  Their phone number was NOT working!  You could not reach Melt by phone on a Tuesday afternoon!  All three of us tried on our phones and NOTHING!  We would dial the number and hear silence for a few seconds followed by three beeps and then disconnected.  We tried for 30 minutes and eventually we were just getting hungry so we wrote everything down and drove up to Melt as it was relatively close.        Parking can be an issue for some because it doesn't matter if you park on the street out front or in the back, you have to pay for parking if it is not Saturday or in the evening.  We parked out front and we were lucky. There was almost 15 minutes left on our meter.  Just enough time to order.        As soon as we approached the front counter my one girlfriend who was with me is sometimes more blunt (this was one of those times).  She said, \"Does anyone care here that the phone is not working?\"  I replied with her explaining that we have been trying to place a take out order so we had to come in because the phone was off.  Not one but TWO employees had the worst responses!  One employee said, \"Yeah, that's happened before.\"  Another employee next to her said \"That happens quite a bit actually.\"  WHAT!?!?!  Apparently that was the end of that for them because they were not going to do anything about it!!  Oh well, I'm sure they lost business on this day.  I even proceeded to call their number from my cell phone and show the employees (there were 5 of them at the front take out counter).  All of them had absolutely NO interest if the phones were working or not.  What if an employee had to call in??  Not important at this establishment I guess.        We ordered our food and they said it would take 15 minutes??  We ordered 3 Burgers, pierogies, and my friend ordered ribs (or so we thought?).  We put more time on our parking meter and went next door to Campbell's Sweet Shop.  We spent just about 15 minutes there and headed back to Melt.  We walked in and sat down on the wooden bench they have near the takeout counter. We might as well have been ghosts or invisible because those same 5 employees that were at the counter before were all up there and not one of them asked if they could help us!  In the next 15 minutes of sitting there (We are now approaching 30 minutes for what was said to be 15 minute food) and not one employee there asked if they could help us or if we needed anything.  Within those 15 minutes I did try to call their number again and still nothing.  After 15 minutes of sitting on the wooden bench two girls walked right past us with yellow plastic bags and placed them on the take out counter.  The two of them talked over the bags for another 2-3 minutes.  We thought they were organizing the food for us. No, I was wrong.  They were simply talking to each other about their friends calling and not calling them and proceeded to take out their personal phones and walked away from our food!  I was seriously upset at this point and my girlfriend who has very light skin was now red in the face like a tomato.  I told her I would ask if that was our food as there were NO other possible take out orders since the phone wasn't working!  I simply asked the employee who was there, \"Is that our food?\" and gave him the name.  He must have been new because he seemed to be reading EVERYTHING on the receipt as it took him quite some time to tell us that it was.  Just as the employee verified our food an older gentleman who was an employee we had not seen walked behind the counter and my friend then replied again \"Do you know your phones are not working?\"  \"Oh, they aren't working?  I'll get right on that.\"  At this point all we could do was shake our heads.  I'm sorry honey but a day late, a dollar short and the bank is closed!  NO COMMUNICATION from one employee to another!  Disorganized and it wasn't very busy!  There were two tables used totally approx. 8 customers dining in. NO EXCUSE FOR ANY OF THIS!  On top of that our order was $56!!!       All I cared about at this point was our food and getting out of this place and the hope our food would make this whole trip worth something. Pictures with their online menu would help. We should have eaten elsewhere."}
{"text":"THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS AT ALL!!!   Food was amazing. I was able to change the cheese on my sandwich to add even more flavor to an already amazing meal. We showed up at 11am when they opened. They worked with us to seat a group of 8 and were very nice. I wouldn't attempt to do this later in the day as I've heard it gets very crowded.  The menus are printed on old record album covers and are cute and kitschy. The decor was a mix of different holiday lights, and lining the tops of their drink coolers were the marquees to classic video games like \"Galaga\" and \"Pac-man\". The bathrooms for the ladies had a chalk board in there. We asked for chalk but they were currently out. =(  Otherwise we had such a great time. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We originally wanted to go here after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  We first attempted to go on a Saturday night at 7pm.......not a good idea!  2 hour wait!  Another sign that said we have to try this place.  We went back on a Tuesday at 3:30pm and were seated right away.  I have the Monte Cristo and my wife had the Crab Cake Melt.  Both were awesome!  Our kids shared a Burger Melt, which was more than enough.  You also get a huge portion of fries and coleslaw.  The melts were all very good, especially the crab cake.  if we venture back to Cleveland, we will certainly hit this place again.  Sitting right by the kitchen we saw so many other melts go out, we now want to try them all!  Service was great as well!!"}
{"text":"By far one of the most unique food establishments I've visited. They taken the standard grilled cheese to the next level! First let's start with the ambience-very unique. A bunch of random signs on the walls but the best part are the light up plastic holiday figures. Examples include santas, pumpkins, Easter Bunnys. The staff was very welcoming and we were seated quickly.   The menu is rather large for modified grilled cheeses. We started out meal with Deep fried Mac and Cheese. Delicious! Great meal opener. I had the Parmagadden. Which was a grilled cheese with pierogies, onions, and kraut. Yes that's right, two pierogies on a grilled cheese. It was delicious, quite possibly the best thing I've eaten. My wife had the Cuban War Pig-which was ham pulled pork, Swiss cheese and honey mustard. She also enjoyed it. It's important to point out, I'm a big guy and I went with the full sandwich and it filled me, near the point of not being able to finish it. You may want to strongly consider getting the half...  This is a great place with a unique concept. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Still an overhyped greasy spoon to me.  I came here again with a group of people.  This time I thought I would try to remove what didn't like last time, to get bread that wasnt dripping with grease when i bite into it.  I tried asking for no or even just a little spread on my bread.  NOPE. They refused to do it.  They claimed that their bread is pre margarineized. So again, all I tasted was greasy salty slices of bread and not my tasty innards.  Why can they substitute so much for vegetarians and not other folks who want to taste the contents of my sandwich and not just the greasy bread?  Now i didn't come here trying to find a low cal meal. I just want to be able to taste the comforting goodness of the sandwich insides.  I honestly can't when my bread is dripping with grease. Given this, I can do so much better at home, where i can really taste my comfort food and without the upset stomach.  However, I do need to give credit where credit is due.  The tomato soup was damn good stuff!  Servers and hosts are friendly too.  But I will not be back unless it is just for the bar.  I still love the knowledgable bartenders and selection.  Kudos to them!"}
{"text":"I usually come here in the summer for the awesome pig roast melt. It's a summery monthly special sandwich with pulled pork, cole slaw, sweet potato, and muenster. You can go wrong with it! But I'm here to let you in on a little secret..... My boyfriend ordered the wet hot buffalo chicken melt and it was awesome! If you like spicy foods you gotta try it. I found myself trying to sneak a bite (and then stealing the leftovers) every time he looked away. Ill be back for it!"}
{"text":"Holy moly!!! If you don't like savory oozing cheese, then don't come here!! Ordered the half order Monte Cristo- something I only treat myself to about once every 15 years. It was beyond perfection and incredibly too big to fit in your mouth (even if you have a big mouth like me!). Raspberry preserves are traditionally served on the side, but they served theirs with sauce- which was just as yummy! Great atmosphere; casual and buzzing. Friendly service. Smiles all around."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and decadent. Unfortunately, today's experience has been frustrating. I had many failed attempts via the online ordering system, ultimately choosing to order a combination of items that weren't my first choice. The problem seemed embedded in the online system.   Our order was then 30 minutes late."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak sandwiches should really only be eaten at places that specialize in Philly cheese steak sandwiches. I got excited though and ordered one here the other night and it found its way inside me with no problem. Food's great and a perfect ambiance. This place really captures Cleveland. I weep when I think of the cities I've visited without eating at places like this. They also have a monte cristo that comes with a side of grape jelly that my friend ordered. Upon taking a bite I produced jelly of my own. The bad wrap the city of Cleveland has had for so long is on its way out. If the Cavs don't win in 2015, they'll do it in 2016."}
{"text":"(Not this is not a recent review, but my opinion has and will more than likely NOT change.)  The best gourmet grilled cheese ever! Worth every penny.  I have driven from Buffalo, NY to Cleveland, just for the melt! I'm pretty low-key when eating here so I haven't tried anything other than the Kindergarten, but let's just say that aside from making my own grilled cheese sandwich, nothing compares to this when eating out and craving that grilled cheese."}
{"text":"The Melt is probably my all time favorite restaurant. They take Grilled cheese to the next level, and it couldn't be done better. I've frequented both locations during my time in Cleveland, and I can honestly say, it is the only restaurant where I would both wait 4 hours for a table, and not even be upset about it.  The servers are always friendly along with the bar staff, great beer selection (which makes the long wait a lot easier). Every time I walked in they would be playing a different 80's movie  classic on the televisions, it's really a great vibe when you come in. Even their menus come on the back of old records.   I've never gotten a sandwich there I didn't like honestly, and thanks to their giant proportions, I always manage to bring about half of it home for a tasty treat later.   If you're going to be in either Lakewood or Cleveland, you simply have to go to the Melt. At least once. Be prepared for a long wait (especially if its around the dinner hour) but trust me when I say it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"ok, you guys.  i find the melt obsession to be over the top. nothing would convince me to get a tattoo of a grilled cheese. i would never come here more than once every six months or so. i don't come during the day, i always expect to wait a few minutes even at 10pm, and i don't care what TV shows it has been on.  yes, this is a tourist/suburbanite hotspot. but is this food good? YES. IT REALLY IS.  i get the plain grilled cheese with muenster and tomato soup. this is my favorite meal of all time. i don't get the fries or slaw. just a simple sandwich and soup.   melt makes me feel like i've swallowed a brick, and i typically don't feel so hot the day following. it's not the best restaurant in cleveland- i mean, the suburbs!!!!- but it's freaking good.  they need to open a downtown location. eff independence! open up downtown, support to city of cleveland, and delight in being one of the most popular restaurants in the CITY of cleveland. thank you and goodnight."}
{"text":"I heard the rumors, I thought \"there's no way it's as good as they say\"--and boy was I wrong. The Dude Abides is like a Sheetz big mozz on all sorts of supplements. I was blown away in a cheesy supernova with some fries."}
{"text":"Melt has half and full sized sandwich options.  The price difference is just a few bucks.  Just be aware that the full size is really about the size as two sandwiches.  Plan to share it or take it to go.  Had a great sandwich there and also a good salad.  Decent number of beer choices in a nice relaxed atmosphere.  Problem is it is pretty busy and packed.  I can see why..."}
{"text":"Ok 2 hour wait; at 7:20 with 8 tables open.  Ok I get it. Your are The Melt, but the hostess says, \" yes there are tables open, but we have to clear the tables, first. I do know a little bit about what I'm doing\"! That was not necessary.  I merely asked because there just a few waiting. Have not been there in quite a few years, and may not go back real soon! I know the food is good, but the hostess was not very gracious"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's usually pretty busy on the weekends and you'll probably have to wait a while to get a table, but that's expected with Melt and the wait is usually worth your time. But if you need a quick fix and don't have the time to wait to dine in, they do takeout and the wait has never been unreasonable (around a half hour from the time I called).   The service is pretty solid and the people are cool. They definitely handle to flow of guests well.   I would recommend the Dude Abides sandwich for anyone who's never tried (meatballs, mozzarella sticks, grilled cheese, parmesan, marinara sauce...delicious). And the beer selection is very good as well."}
{"text":"Delicious. So many choices and it's a very fun setting!  My gripe unfortunately is with the staff and customer service. While I can't complain about the wait since I came in with a big party, the girl who took down our name at the hostess/to-go counter was just one eye roll away from being reported to her boss. I get it, you're a hipster in an up and coming part of town... But you should still treat waiting customers with respect by talking in complete sentences and not giving me a bad look for saying we are willing to wait for a large table. While waiting, my husband decided to ask for a sandwich to go so that he could run it down Belle to our aunt who was stuck at home. The same young woman didn't seem to understand this and instinctively told him he couldn't do that until we sat down, cue eye roll. Even if it was a separate order. Fortunately, her co-worker came around, understood what we were asking and took care of the order.  Once we sat down, the poor waitress looked like she hated life. Hey management, if your wait staff is going to be short with people when it's not super busy, cut them and get a replacement. When I asked what kind of cheese was on the basic grill cheese sandwich that we all know and love (I couldn't remember if it was cheddar, American, or something else?) this waitress's face was clearly annoyed. Sure, it's a dumb question, I could've googled it, but I thought that maybe this woman would be able to help me figure it out or be less rude about it. Embarrassed, I just picked a cheese and just left it at that. When she came out with soup she slammed it on the table and walked away swiftly. If I wanted to be passive aggressively abused via service of food, id go to jail or go to boot camp.   This place has a great reputation and delicious food. But screen the people who are the face of the business and make sure they properly remove any sticks from sensitive orifices."}
{"text":"Cheese lovers, rejoice! Even cheese likers, rejoice! Melt is a fun spot with awesome comfort food and a great drink selection. The menu is split into different sections like beef, chicken, vegetarian, etc., but each sandwich is made to order and you can substitute or add almost anything. There is even a section of the menu dedicated to add-ons and accommodations, including meat substitutes and other options for vegetarians and vegans.   I got the Dude Abides, which comes with marinara, mozzarella sticks and two big, fat meatballs. It was flavorful and delicious - my only complaint is that it was too tall to fit in my mouth! Each grilled cheese comes with a pickle and a generous amount of fries that are crispy and well-seasoned with salt and pepper. I heard that it gets crazy-crowded, but I went at around 2 on a weekday and didn't have a problem getting a table for 4. I highly recommend this place and hope to be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Their food is okay, but it's just sandwiches and I'm not sure they are worth the prices. I am also not very impressed by their french fries. Their hours don't make much sense to me since it seems like brunch food but most days they aren't even open for lunch at all."}
{"text":"ate here about a year ago in the restaurant while visiting family, and then came back again this year for takeout. the food is just outstanding. the mushroom melt was delicious and enough for 2 meals. prices are quite reasonable for how much food you get. would definitely come back through here on my next trip!"}
{"text":"(This is probably closer to 3.5 stars to me.)  Melt has a large menu of flavorful, creative grilled-and-cheesy sandwiches...plus menu includes the basic grilled cheese for good measure.  The sandwiches are HUGE, so the half-sandwich option is nice.  (The next time, I'm ignoring my stomach's ego and taking that option!)  The sides were good and seemed to have southern bent.  The drinks menu is also giant; it's heavy on beers, both on tap and in bottles, but includes plenty of cocktails and wines as well.  The restaurant has a fun vibe.  This starts with the décor -- which includes numerous light-up lawn decorations from several holidays and a few lit signs from businesses like Krispy Kreme and Dairy Queen -- and extends to the friendly, lively, responsive staff."}
{"text":"\"I would move to Cleveland for this,\" is what I thought throughout my visit here.  This is an amazing place.  The atmosphere is fun and lively, and it's a cross between a dive bar and a fun casual restaurant . . . emphasis on the dive bar feel though, which is perfect.  As everyone else has said, the food is outstanding, unique, and PLENTIFUL.  (Definitely bring your appetite!)  Plus, there's an extensive selection of draft and bottled beers from all over.  To top it off, the staff across the board is warm, friendly, helpful, patient, and hilarious.  I look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for a Parmageddon three days ago and I finally got to Melt. No disappointment, they delivered. People complain about the wait but I usually just sit at bar. Great service, great vegan and vegetarian options, great beer selection. Cool decor. You almost forget you are Mentor the capital of suburbia and strip malls."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from Melt.  The concept sounded so gimmicky to me and I was sure I would't like it.  I was very wrong.   I ordered the Godfather and my friend ordered the special, the Prime Time Au Jus Melt.   The lasagna layered inside the Godfather sandwich was great!  The idea of pasta wedged inside Texas toast sounds like a bad one but it worked. I think they throw the lasagna on the flattop to give the pasta some texture and crispiness.  Whatever they're doing in the kitchen, they got it right.  The Prime Time Au Jus melt wasn't as good however.  There was not only roast beef but also a layer of mashed potatoes inside.  The mashed potato layer made everything feel mushy and my friend found it unpleasant.  It was the complete opposite texture of the Godfather.  Maybe if they replace it with a fried potato croquette, it would result in a better sandwich. Just a thought....  I also want to give props to our server David(I think it was David). Something about his demeanor just made lunch that much more enjoyable.  He seemed to genuinely enjoy his job and always had a smile when checking on us.  It's the little things like that that elevate a restaurants rating.   If I ever need to carbo load in the Cleveland area, this is the place to do it!"}
{"text":"I really wish we enjoyed our food as much as a lot of the people on here seemed to have.. both my fiancé's and my sandwiches were soggy and we aren't feeling that great after. We enjoyed our deep fried pickles app though."}
{"text":"I've been to Melt many times and have almost tried every sandwich. However, hands down the Buffalo Chicken Melt is my favorite. I was really excited when they made it a permanent menu item. If you haven't been to Melt I suggest you go when you are really hungry. Portions are large, service is great, and the food is delicious. Definitely a 5 star establishment."}
{"text":"This was my first experience to Melt and I have to say it was awesome.  Everything was fantastic, and I will explain... my buddy and I went for a late lunch today (Monday) and there was only a few people there, so for me it was perfect since I am not a fan of crowds.  Next, the decorations are creative, fun and playful... and I had never thought to use holiday light sculptures as a decoration other than a yard ornament, but it is looks great and works for the space.  The server was excellent and attentive; he came back to the table at least 4 or 5 times, and repeatedly refilled our drinks, made sure we were doing okay, asked if we needed anything... wonderful service.  I ate the El Diablo, which was great... really spicy, but I like to sweat and tear up when eating tasty things.  It brought a tear to my eye; but in a good way.  The burger was spicier than I expected which caught me off guard... loved every minute of it.  The quality of food was excellent and matched with the quantity, which was very filling.  The menu had so many things I wanted to try.  The beer list looked great, but need a designated driver for next time.  There appeared to be a variety of root beer options, so a variety of root beer flavors?  Every thing I am writing is leading me to one conclusion, and that is I am going to go back to try different things, and share this fun atmosphere and great customer service experience with my wife.  I whole heartedly recommend this place which exceeded my expectations and made me a believer of this establishment."}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant on rockside road... Very attentive waiters, long beer and drink list, good atmosphere, sandwich list that is overwhelming.  I had the cuban which was amazing. Fries were hand cut.  Could hardly eat half of my order.  Many tvs with game on.  Affordable prices.  Def one of the cooler restaurants to grab a quick, but good, casual bite. Everyone working there was very friendly"}
{"text":"Omg too good went here for the first time saw all the reviews on yelp and not a dissapointment  I got the 1/2,sand which and soup with salad yummy"}
{"text":"Melt certainly made my experience in Cleveland very memorable. In fact, I celebrated my 20th birthday there!   The menu is unique and the place is buzzing with people. The sandwiches are totally awesome - however, the best part really is having a sweet drink menu. There is a huge selection of not only beers but ROOT beers. It really doesn't get much better than a greasy grilled sandwich + a delicious 'boutique root beer'. If you're not from the area, you should definitely check this place out!   The murals here are cool too but I think I prefer the Lakewood location."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Great service to start.  We had the potato soup, had great rich, peppery flavor. I got the fried eggplant grilled cheese with fresh tomatos, delicious! big enough to share for sure! We rounded out the meal with fried twinkies. Everyone in our party loved their meal!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find.  The food is delicious, and there are a ton of options. You would be surprised with the amount of choices when it comes to a grilled cheese sandwich. The creations are all very smart and fun, you will need time to really narrow down your search, because you're going to want half the menu. They also have a really nice beer selection and a ton of TVs to catch the game.  Be prepared to wait a long time for a table. Bar staff is good, not great."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time visiting this location and I love the food. The first time I had the Monte Cristo and the 2nd visit I had Mom's Meat Loaf Dinner and both were excellent. I love the raspberry dipping sauce with the MAC and the ketchup on MMLD is so freaking good! To boot the French fries are fresh and so good! Can't wait to return to try my next sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Awesome grilled sandwiches.  I don't really like grilled cheese so I wasn't pumped to come here as I assumed all the sandwiches would be pouring over with cheese.  Instead, what I found in my sandwich- and in the sandwiches of the other people I was with that I tried- were very balanced ingredients in which cheese played an important but not overwhelming role.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service. My sandwich was a solid portion on crispy think toast. I definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong at melt, especially if you have a big appetite. Came while family was visiting. Was the first time I only got half a sandwich and boy did I feel way better afterwards than I usually do after eating a whole one and all the fries. Got Mac and cheese bites to share. Delicious! Then got the potato chorizo half. Melt is amazing though definitely once in a blue moon visit or else I'd double in size."}
{"text":"I was visiting Ohio on business and saw this place on Yelp. Decided to give it a try. I showed up on Sunday around six and the place was packed. Luckily there was a lone seat at the bar so I took it. I was driving in an unfamiliar place so I decided just to drink an iced tea.  The menu is extensive to say the least. If they haven't dreamed up the sandwich you can customize however you like. My server was named Vincent and was extremely helpful. I told him what I hate and then asked him to order for me. He asked me a few questions and then we agreed upon The Big Popper plus bacon. I initially wanted onion rings but I was told the fries shouldn't be missed. Well, Vincent was right. The sandwich was awesome as were the fries.  Regarding decor- I've never been to the original so I don't know how off the mark this one was. Bottom line, the decor is kitschy. It's a restaurant centered around grilled cheese sandwiches. I really didn't expect much decor-wise.  The beer menu looked comprehensive. The sandwich was immense BTW. it is of Carnegie Deli sized proportion. I felt bad wasting so much of it but I wasn't taking it back to the hotel room. The dessert menu was eh but really, how many people have room for dessert after those melts? I tried the fried twinkies b/c I had never tried them and could cross them off my bucket list. I'd go with an \"eh\" on the twinkies. Nothing wrong with the restaurant's execution. I just don't love twinkies.  As I was eating my sandwich I thought to myself that this would be a goldmine in NYC. Then I remembered that we print calories on our menues. Had I seen the calories on this place I probably would've left before ordering out of sheer guilt. I didn't think it was expensive but I'm used to NY prices.  I will say te wait here can be daunting. There was a family seated on the bench waiting for a table when I walked in and they didn't get a table 'til I was nearly through eating. It also took time for my food but the place was packed."}
{"text":"ME AND MY WIFE wanted to try something new so we went with Melt Bar and Grill and it didn't disappoint. If you are in the Cleveland area you must try it out. There fried Mac and Cheese bites are unreal and there Monte Cristo and Parma Italy didn't fall short either. It was really worth whatever the price was and the cost for good food is priceless."}
{"text":"The wait is long but it is WORTH IT. Every time I am in Cleveland this is a mandatory stop. Delicious vegan options and great craft brew selections. I CRAVE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"Heading east to Firefly in Dover, my girlfriend and I decided to stop at Melt -- I've heard, read, and seen a lot about Melt via social media and on television, so I wasn't going in here blind, but with high hopes and my fingers crossed.  I can say that Melt, for the most part, delivered.  Walking in, the place is cozy in appearances and also in size. The aesthetic reminds me of Stella's in Grand Rapids in Michigan ... okay, I'm going to guess 99.7% of anyone reading this doesn't know what that means. It just has a very nostalgic vibe to it with a few arcade machines and cartoons playing on many of the TVs. My first impression is good.  After being seated, we were greeted by one of the most kick ass waiters ever, Dave. He was helpful in going over the menu, was knowledgeable about what was on the beer menu and the city of Cleveland, and was just all-around very helpful.  My girlfriend opted for the chicken and waffle grilled cheese and I went for the chorizo and potato grilled cheese. My girlfriend's sandwich was ridiculous -- I wish I had taken a picture. It was an absolute monster, and is unlikely to fit in most normal human's mouth. We had pictured a filet of chicken breast between two waffles, but nah -- Melt puts the waffle between the bread.   Now, good things tend to come in small packages, but this is an exception. Incredibly crispy, tender, and juicy chicken, a delicious raisin-filled waffle, a subtle spicy sriracha kick, and a little bit of sweet maple syrup on the side to dip or pour at your leisure. This truly was one of the better sandwiches I've ever had -- my two criticisms are minor. One would be that with all the bread, it's a bit dense... especially because of the waffle. My second would be that for being a grilled cheese, the cheese seems to be an afterthought on this bad boy. Regardless of that, this is most definitely a sandwich worthy of a purchase or two or seven.  My sandwich was a little less jaw dropping, unfortunately, mainly because the filling in my chorizo potato grilled cheese wasn't all that ample when compared to the thick bread on my sandwich. The flavor itself was good, but there was a little too much bread. Also, I feel like this sandwich was a little dense as well... in this case, a little more filling or, better yet, some sort of sauce would have been great.  The fries were pretty decent, but not fantastic. They came out a bit cold and a little on the soggy side, but the flavor was there. I love fries with skins still on them.  I'm no doubt nit-picking with my score, because the service and chicken and waffle sandwich were both top notch, but the fries and the chorizo and potato grilled cheese aren't something I'd likely re-order -- especially with a menu of grilled cheeses as extensive as Melt's.  If you're craving something greasy and cheesy that will make you feel a little remorseful after finishing it, Melt has you covered. I will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well well well. 7/15/15. I need to try melt university and the stand at the Jake, excuse me, progressive field. But I've been to all the other locations. Mentor is still my favorite. Good crew here. They treat me pretty well when I come in. Jason is turning into a mind reader (as a good barkeep should). Always enjoy being waited on by Ray, Josh, Ashley, and more. Not usually a wait late on a Wednesday when I usually go, but if there is you can get the full menu at the bar.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had a terrific meal at Melt.    Ordered the,Gyro melt and my wife had the Italian.   Both were huge and looked and tasted great.  Our waitress Felicia was super friendly.  A couple slight drawbacks,  its loud in there and I still don't understand the slaw.   But don't let that stop you, its a real treat!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty much non existent. Prices were WAY over the top.  We'd finally had enough of the overcrowded and way too noisy atmosphere when our hostess couldn't seat us before taking a personal call and then the server not coming around for drink orders at all. We walked out. Save your hard earned money for some place you might actually get waited on."}
{"text":"Amazing. Great service. I got the Lake Erie Monster. The cod was fresh and the fries were crisp. Couldn't ask for more. Try Melt!!!"}
{"text":"The food isn't spectacular but gluten free bread for their grilled cheese section is enough for me!! I feel like a little kid again. They have an extremely detailed description on their menu of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options. The waiters were funky and the place had an old fashioned indie rocker vibe. I love these hidden gems, and supporting local businesses! Definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Great food service was quick and the drinks were good. Kid friendly which is a major plus"}
{"text":"I met a guy that works at the airport that says he goes here all the time and that is very good.  I'm so glad I remembered he mentioned it when I was walking by Saturday.  We tried the Outback earlier but there was some weird ammonia smell that after being reseated twice was still overwhelming.  So we got up and left and started heading down the main road in search of something to eat when about after a half a mile or so we saw the sign for Melt.  It was definitely worth illegally crossing an 8 lane highway for on foot! It was packed with at least a 20 to 30 minute wait for a table, but we easily got a seat at the bar and were promptly engaged by our server.  It was a little overwhelming at first.  So many sandwiches and then we saw them coming out of the kitchen.  They are gigantic!  We started of with some Perogies and some Labatt's Blue.  (I know there are a ton of different beer options here but, I never get Labatt's at home and it makes me nostalgic for fun times in Canada and I actually do like the cleaner purer taste than a lot of other beers in its gam.)   We finally decided on the Meatball sub with the four huge slices of cheese and a grilled cheese sandwich.  We couldn't finish it all.  I switched from beer to corn syrup free Sioux City Root Beer with cane sugar when the meal came.  The sandwiches beer and root beer really satisfied us!  I would definitely recommend this place if you like huge sandwiches and beer. The staff were all very friendly and engaging and extremely efficient.  We had a good view of the kitchen and they were all methodical and quick, but not frantic.  This place runs like a well oiled machine both in and out of the kitchen.  I'm impressed and I will be back when I am in town again!"}
{"text":"food was really good. Enough food for 2 meals just way to expensive. I would go back should try atleast once"}
{"text":"I thought it was about time to update my review. I have been to multiple Melt locations many times and I can say the food is great. My food has always been fresh, hot, and delicious. Also, I can never eat the whole meal and the food always heats up well in the oven for a second meal. I recently tried Sunday brunch and it was very good. The food is very heavy but that is the point. If you are looking for something light Melt is not the place to go.   I have never had bad service at Melt either. The location I have received the best service and food at is the Mentor one. It is not nearly as packed as the other locations and the staff is very friendly. I make sure to go to Melt during non peak eating hours and I never have to wait.  P.S. The reason you see empty tables in a restaurant and are not seated is probably to not overload the kitchen. If not you would be waiting an insane amount of time for your food."}
{"text":"I enjoy Melt very much.  It is a place I enjoy taking out of towners. The staff is always friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"This is going to sound crazy but I don't go to Melt for their sandwiches. They have amazing soup, salads, appetizers and drinks. My friend and I regularly go here for brunch, lunch and dinner and the  service is always really good and the selection of drinks is great. I'm vegetarian and their options are great. I regularly get the house salad with the sweet chili lime dressing and the tomato soup. It is my go-to. The awesome noodle dish is great too. Yummy!"}
{"text":"HUGE portions. The Mac and cheese bites are ah-mazing.  Had the turkey club, and it's lasted me for three meals. The Rosemary aioli is fantastic. Beer selection is top notch.  Service was also awesome."}
{"text":"This month, I had my first \"Melt\" experience while visiting family in Cleveland.  I'd been informed that the Lakewood location is the best, but not wanting to make my family travel from the east side, we decided on the Mentor location on a Sunday night.  Firstly, I was extremely pleased by the service.  Our waiter was attentive, worked around multiple food allergies/restrictions, and put up with several people changing their orders.  We were a needy table, and he was sweet at pie about it.  Next up, the food.  My brother and I shared the pierogi as a starter, despite warnings from our family that we wouldn't have enough room for our entrees, but I'm so glad we did, because it was the highlight of my meal.   The napa cabbage kraut was a fantastic touch; I've been craving that flavor since I ate at Melt.    For my entree, I tried the \"Wake and Bacon\" sandwich, with jalapenos added, and a side of tomato soup.  The sandwich was delicious, but so dense and greasy that I really could only take a couple of bites before admitting defeat.   The tomato soup was less impressive -- a weird consistency (more like tomato puree) with very little seasoning.    I was pretty content with our food while we were dining.  I took home most of my sandwich, and let me tell you, it was disgusting the next day.  So savor it while it's warm. (Tomorrow it will be a greasy mess!)   I'd dine here again though it won't be on the top of my list."}
{"text":"If you live in the Northeast Ohio area, you know there isn't a lot of unique places to eat. Melt has always been everyones go-to place.  It gets really loud, and sometimes seating is too-close-for-comfort. The food is hit-or-miss, but I still believe it remains to be quality. The first time, get something you know you're going to like.  The best part for me is the vegan and vegetarian options. Hard to find in NEOhio. The vegan wings are SOOOO good."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great. The fries are mediocre. When the restaurant opened in Lakewood the fries were great. They were fresh cut and dark brown and crunchy. Once they opened more locations the fries became bland institutional crap. The bread pudding is excellent and we actually check the email each month to see what the sandwich and bread pudding specials are so we don't miss a good one."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese is one of my favorite foods and Melt does not disappoint. It's also very simple so I wouldn't call it a must-have or to-die-for meal. It's cheap considering the big portion. I liked the soup and sandwich deal, was a good portion! Interesting interior and a full bar inside!"}
{"text":"Unreal and awesome. Went with the gf and 2 friends.  We were really hungry, but my friends advised against getting an appetizer since it will spoil our appetite. Boy were they right. The menu is very diverse and there is a great selection of beers. I got the \"dude abides\" after asking the waiter. It was meatballs and mozz sticks on a grilled cheese sandwich. Wicked sweet and it was as big as a shoe box. Well worth waiting for. The gf got the special \"the melt pig roast\" Bbq pulled pork on grilled cheese.  Everyone enjoyed their meals, and while the service was a little slow, we loved the chance to talk and drink. Within minutes I was thinking how to get financing to make my own Melt back home. Great concept, great atmosphere. Great price (8 drinks, 4 entrees = 100 bux!!!!)  If you ever find yourself in Cleveland eat here and the city will totally redeem itself."}
{"text":"The Kindergarten Melt (Grilled Cheese and Tomato) was almost perfect, but the tomato was over ripe, which ruined it. Sorry, you just cannot get away with serving rotten tomatoes.  My friend got the Monte Cristo Melt and loved it. Beautiful looking. The best selection on the menu. I liked the choices for Vegans too. The coffee was terrific. The service was perfect and the food came out really quickly. Now for the noise report: The music was annoying...lots of electric guitar played too loud on some very cheap speakers. Yes, I am over 30. It was frantic rock...not enjoyable rock. Those of us over 30  had to shout over the music.  It feels like a dance bar, but it is a restaurant. I think the goal is to attract the under 30 crowd.  When we left at Noon on a Sunday, there was a line out the door. Standing room only. Lots and lots of people love Grilled Cheese. The food is very good."}
{"text":"Wow really good food. The banana cider was great. The meatloaf grilled cheese was so tasty. The bread was gluten free. Thank you."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. Love the vintage Cleveland-Area post cards, posters, signs and all things Ohio. Really great atmosphere. Huge draft selection. Huge selection of grilled cheese and you can literally build a sandwich with almost any ingredient you can think of. This place is legit."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in the door, you know this place is more than grilled cheese.  From the eclectic decorations on the walls, to the eccentric servers delivering mounds of deliciousness, to the knowledgeable bartenders that help you hand pick your libation, Melt is an experience all visitors to Cleveland must have.  Now that the \"4 hour wait\" is a thing of the past due to more locations, you can drop in and cozy up to the bar almost immediately.  As someone who loves their cheese, but loves their hops even more, the one-two punch of \"Sandwich of the month\" and a myriad of both draft and bottled beers makes every trip to Melt a unique experience.  Gigantic sandwiches at reasonable prices are accompanied by mounds of coleslaw and fries, or you can make it all fries, or all slaw.  For a minimal fee, they even allow those health conscious patrons (there ARE more calorically responsible selections than others) to change to a veggie of the day or side salad.  Vegans and vegetarians beware.  You will not escape satiety.  They have dreamed up alternative versions of even there most carnivorous selections, and even the finely tuned palate of a corn-fed Midwesterner might have trouble differentiating.  So, whether you are a Man vs Food follower conquering local challenges, an aunt or uncle entertaining the nieces and nephews, or the slow-pitch softball team making a pit-stop to rehydrate, Melt Bar and Grilled has what you are looking for!  I have even contemplated a small tattoo for their tempting lifelong discount!  Good luck picking just one sandwich to try!"}
{"text":"I had the purple parma and this sandwich is a belly buster. All of the sandwiches are huge. The atmosphere is really cool and the employees are just as interesting to look at. The food tastes great and you get lots if it for what you pay. Not to mention they have a great draft beer selection."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love Melt and recently visited with our daughter. We had two great meals and thought the service was good too. My only two complaints are that at this location they clean/clear the plates at the bar and it was REALLY loud. And second, I asked for honey mustard and was charged for it. I don't mind paying for it, but I think restaurant's should tell you if they are going to charge you for a condiment."}
{"text":"The place is cool. The decor is rock and roll. However the food is not that good. I thought it would be so much more."}
{"text":"Consistently awesome, creative, inexpensive for the amount of food you get. Great veg options and good specials! Wait times are no longer insane, bartenders are great. Fries are meh so get the veggie of the day or a side salad and share if you can! Takeout is great too - love love love!"}
{"text":"Always good fried and fattening food. The chili is awesome.  The beer is ever better with Dortmunder on tap."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer, gigantic portions, and friendly staff. If you're expecting anything else, that's your fault. My date and I sat at the bar and had several drinks while we waited on our food- that's exactly what you should be doing here- and everything was great. The waitress was usually back in time to pick up the next beer selection by the time my glass ran dry, and after a few rounds our food appeared. I'm a big guy, and I had to work to eat half the Monte Christo. The portion sizes have to be seen to be believed, and that makes the prices very reasonable. I got reasonably drunk, completely stuffed, and had a laughing good time with my girl. That's exactly how a place like this should be- although they could stand to turn down the music a touch."}
{"text":"The peanut butter and jelly grilled cheese was suuuper good. Might be the best pbnj i've ever had. Also had the parmageddon, and that was delish as well. It was packed when we came, so the food came out quickly. My family and I just loved every bite of the grilled cheeses.   The next time I go back, I'll try the Big Popper or the Spinach Pie. I'll probably get the pbnj as well!!  Great selection of beer!"}
{"text":"Yummy....sandwiches big enough to share and fries are great!  Very fun atmosphere and friendly wait staff.   Have had several different items off  the menu and was very happy with all of them!"}
{"text":"Back again last night. Who can resist a place dedicated to exotic grilled cheese sandwiches? Once again an amazing culinary experience. I went with the monthly special \"prime rib\" and a cup of broccoli-red-pepper-alfredo soup. They have expanded since the last time I was in town and it's still packed... Expect an hour wait any night of the week."}
{"text":"Stopped here, hung over the day after a wedding in Beachwood. It was a first stop prior to going to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.   I fell in love, once I walked through the doors. This place is seriously quirky. Lots of cool people work here. Our waitress was bitchin'.  Full bar, and from what I could tell, there were at least 50 beers on tap. They have everything!  The menu is so rad, it was printed on the back of record albums. I wish I would have taken more time to browse; I ended up getting the Wake and Bacon, and it wasn't until days later, when I learned they had a Monte Cristo sammy. BLURG!  I loved the atmosphere, and the service was pretty good. Pricing was within my ballpark.   It's kind of a \"must see\" if  you are in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Delicious. The portions are huge. The food is made to order. The sandwiches with fries and slaw is almost too much to eat. Great bar service even when crowded. Which is always. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've tried many of the sandwiches and have loved every one of them. My wife stays with the mushroom melt and thinks it's the best sandwich she's ever had. She used top Getty the burger, but wasn't thrilled about it. The melt city light beer is actually really good. I don't usually like light beer but the melt city light goes great with just about every thing on the menu. A 5 start place for me bcz the food is great, there is a plethora of beer options, and the service has always been solid."}
{"text":"We love this place!! We came during lunch on a weekday and expected a wait, but sat at the bar and were waited on right away! The food came out quick and tasted amazing. I love that you have the option of ordering a half sandwich now. There's a lot of beers on tap and the drink of the month was the sangria bomb pop - awesome!! We will continue to come back here again and again... Even if there is a wait, it's totally worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I went back a third time, and I HAVE to update my review! Me and my friend went in on a Tuesday around 4:30ish and got seated immediately  (I know the weekends are a different story). The staff once again were awesome. The guy we talked to was cool, and the girl who took our order was awesome (even noticed some movie and gaming references that was pretty sweet!).  Now, I decided to get the Parmageddon again for the second time, and we ordered (on the girl's recommendation) an appetizer of Hangover Fries. These fries were the best fries I had in a long time! They consist of gravy, pork belly, mozzarella curds, and a fried egg on top. This was an amazing recommendation on her part. (Wish I knew her name to give her a shout out for being great). Now my previous review was based on take out, and eating the sandwich an hour later cold, but this time I had it fresh, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The flavors popped on the sandwich, and that pierogi was just flavorful as I could imagine. The Nappa Vodka Kraut was the right blend of tangy and flavorful. I was pretty amazed, and unlike my previous review; I can now say that the price is well worth it IMO.  I been here three times, and all three times the crew has been nothing but helpful, and great for conversation to boot. Definitely will be going back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"I am honestly really sad that I'm giving this 3 star rating because everyone from Ohio was telling me how amazing it was. Honestly the best thing about melt wasn't even the grilled cheese sandwiches to me it was the vegan chili soup so so good!!!  We ordered half mac n cheese grilled sandwich and the dude abides they were okay nothing special, maybe we got the wrong ones but I was not impressed. On the other hand I was so impressed on the decor in there it was so cute!! Very LA"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Hard to find anything low cal on the menu, even the salads are drenched in dressing and fatty toppings. Lots of \"bar\" type food and greasy. Huge bar menu, lots of options."}
{"text":"Was a long wait but very good. This is the kind of place that doesn't need apps or dessert on the menu. I don't think the fries are worth getting if you cuttin."}
{"text":"Took a trip on advice from a friend and just loved it. They have 20+ different types of grilled cheese sandwiches and 20 beers on tap. I chose the Parma, Italy grilled sandwich sandwich which had breaded chicken, sundried tomato pesto, and excellent cheese on some great bread. The founder's breakfast stout was great. Very nice atmosphere, cool bartenders and just a great environment overall. I noticed on the bulletin board that they even have \"vegan cheese\" -- in the American and mozzarella variety."}
{"text":"Very good food, with attentive and helpful service.  The food was very good and came in large portions. So large, in fact, that we split a Cuban sandwich, one salad and an appetizer of fried  green tomatoes with corn salsa (5 stars). I ordered a specialty drink made with mango juice and it was also  very good. The star of this meal was the fried green tomatoes, followed by the to big for the plate Cuban sandwich and fries. All of the food was better than average and we took home left overs.  If I find myself in Cleveland again I will definitely seek out the Melt for food and drinks."}

Now sporting some half-dozen restaurants, all thriving including those in Akron and Columbus, it was just past 9:00pm that our party of three was offered seating amidst televisions and luminescent plastic lawn ornaments, a middle-aged server with the company since nearly day one explaining a few daily specials before leaving  us to our decisions, the recent addition of half-sandwiches allowing a whole lot of variety including appetizers and dessert.  Showing Sunday night football in below a soundtrack of tunes spanning the sixties through the eighties it was with still more people entering to fill our section that items started arriving, three golden Mac & Cheese Bites followed by two more with a joke about the cook's math skills, the gooey insides somehow still featuring springy Pasta with extra Cheese sauce added for dipping.  Unable go halfsies on specials, the Voodoo Zombie Chicken Melt thus arriving in whole and flanked by a quartet of half-Sandwiches, those looking for a bit of heat will be happy to know that the Halloween themed dish packed plenty without going atomic or tongue-melting by way of Pickled Peppers  and Plantains, the housemade Chorizo actually a bit more poignant as the breakfast favorite was topped iun crispy Potato Hash and an add-on soft-poached Egg.  Spinning the classic Meatball Sub forward with fried Mozzarella triangles, the Big Lebowski themed title not particularly sensible unless there is a subtle Italian reference in the film that I missed, more great bites were found amongst the messy Cuban War-Pig that sees Havana's famous Sandwich re-created with Frickles and Honey Mustard, the fried Monte Cristo going all-in with both Ham and Turkey plus Swiss and Raspberry Preserves, a rarely seen combination that some will say is true to the dish's earliest diner origins.  Not particularly interested in Fried Twinkies, another Half-Sandwich joining the Seasonal Bread Pudding to round out our meal, my only regret was not ordering the Peanut Butter & Banana Sandwich with a trip to the deep-fryer, the results still tasty but lacking in the face of Custard soaked Chocolate Bread wrapped around Peanut Butter Frosting atop a bed of housemade Whipped Cream and crowned with an oversized scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Full review in blog.  Browsing the menu there were in excess of ten sandwiches I wanted to try and a quick glance at the dessert menu let me know I'd have to save room.  Watching coverage of The Masters and listening to the 60's/70's/80's era music over the stereo we were soon greeted by a young lady named Sophia who would serve as our waitress - and the waitress for nearly half of the busting-at-the-seems-busy restaurant.  Aside from being ridiculously cute and friendly, Sophia was also potentially the best waitress I've ever seen at a busy casual joint - full of information, checking in frequently, drinks never dropping below 1/3 empty, and always with a smile on her face.  Approximately 45 minutes after we were seated our sandwiches arrived - and they were as big, bold, and beautiful as advertised.  Served alongside each of the sandwiches were excellent dill pickles, hand-cut fries - crisp on the outside, densely potato within, and lightly salted, and \"sweet slaw.\"   Beginning first with my Aunt, her selection was entitled Porky Cheese and it featured Honey ham, Crisp bacon, and Swiss cheese.  Featuring hefty slices of white bread, well buttered and grilled perfectly, surrounding a sweet yet savory amalgam of ham, Swiss, and salty bacon I must say it was more nuanced than it reads.  With the bacon adding some crunch and the creaminess of the Swiss balancing the ham the overall effect was almost akin to a croque monsieur though not quite as refined.  With that said, a very serviceable and delicious sandwich.   For my mother's selection she apparently felt so fondly about her first experience at Melt that she ordered the same thing again - but this time she got it deep fried.  Entitled PB and Banana the sandwich featured the same hefty white bread as my Aunt's, but this time was slathered with fresh made peanut butter and sweetened cream cheese served alongside a cup of mixed berry preserves.  \"Mmmmm-ing\" from her first bite I must say it would be hard to say she made the wrong choice - even if I am all about trying new things - as the sandwich was glorious.  With the bread first griddle fried and then dunked in a tempura-esque batter before a quick dunk in the deep frier the sandwich came out piping hot with ripe bananas, liquid peanut butter and mascarpone-sweet cream cheese filling every bite.  Tasty on its own and only improved by a dunk in the delectable fruit puree of raspberry/strawberry/blackberry the crisp bread married perfectly with the creamy interior forming a nut butter sandwich only rivaled by Keller's Cashew Butter and Apricot Compote on Brioche at Bouchon.   For my selection at Melt I went with the monthly special - the Corny Beast.  Opting for the vegetarian version as I don't eat beef my plate contained two enormous cornbread battered and deep fried \"sandwich halves\" with a wooden stick in each.  Contained in the beautiful golden shell was griddled white bread sandwiched around a well charred and excellently textured vegan corndog split and surrounded by double American Cheese - cheese so densely packed that it was leaking out of the batter.  Without a doubt this is the best thing one can do with a hotdog and aside from the fact that the cheese was wonderful, the cornbread was even better.  Served with a Chipotle Ketchup that was not really needed but certainly added another level to the \"sandwich\" the entire effect was smoky yet savory, crunchy yet creamy.  While this dish may be only available for a limited time if I were Melt I'd keep that cornbread batter around for appetizers and more sandwiches in the future.   Having skipped breakfast there was certainly room for dessert. With bread pudding ranking as my very favorite way to finish a meal I went with their dessert special of the day - Fudge Brownie Caramel Pecan Bread Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream. Featuring a thick and fudgy brownie as the base/crust the dish was topped with a well saturated slab of warm and buttery bread pudding laced with ribbons of caramel and fudge and crunchy pecans adding texture.  With two large Chocolate Goldfishes and whipped cream alongside the steaming hot dish was topped with a scoop of creamy ice cream and drizzles of fudge.  Rich, hearty, large, and whimsical I very much liked the dish and although it was not as refined as many of my favorite bread puddings in the past the flavor and balance was excellent.  Having dined at many of the best restaurants in the United States as well as many of the most famous houses of kitschy yet delectable food I can absolutely recommend Melt as a MUST visit for anyone visiting Cleveland.  As one would expect from their cult local following and expanding empire Melt does it right - from food to service to setting.  On their website Melt's owner and chef Matt Fish states that he wanted the restaurant to feel like family, but also wanted eating there to feel like an event - I'd say he succeeded on both counts."}
{"text":"Melt is exactly what it advertises; a ton of food with a lot of cheese. There is a surprising amount of variety to the place in both it's food and drink choices. Being Cleveland, this location has a lot of great beers on tap.   I had the July special, spicy pulled chicken, pineapple spread, avocado slices, all sandwiched between a ton of cheese and thick toasted bread. It's a great meal, and the price may seem hefty, but I have always been able to easily make each sandwich two meals.   On top of that, the staff has always been fantastic. This is a must if you are near Lakewood."}
{"text":"I try to come here every time I come home for a visit.  Mind you, there is always a wait though (yesterday it was 45 min to an hour).  If you drink, chill out with friends over a lavender mojito or some of the yummy beers they have.  I find that the wait does not seem as long when you are in good company   If your group is just two, scope out the bar as that area is first come first serve... Also the corner area midget be good for more people to eat and have a conversation.     The menus are on old records... so it's fun to see who you get.  I had Bryan adams, the others in my party had Pat Benetar and Polka.   The decor is made up of lots of old Ohio License plates, and decorations from most holidays that seem to stay up all year.    It's a chill and laid back place.  The menu has many favourites like mine Parmagedon which consists of a grilled cheese and perogis.  There are many catchy names, ad they always have a special sandwich.  In december it is a mac and cheese grilled cheese.  It is baked or fried mac and cheese within the sandwich.  It was amazing!!!   Despite the long waits, I have always had enjoyable experiences except for that one time when I was hungover.  However, that was of my doing, and the service that day was great as well."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were exceptional. My son loved his chicken parm! We had the club which was great. Good place to go when you don't want to dress up and have some great comfort food. You"}
{"text":"Fried green tomato was excellent. Had the sandwich with the perogies and it was ok. Could have used more sauerkraut than what they put on. Good place would like to try more sandwiches"}
{"text":"Yes, the wait is long.  Yes, the service is slow.  Yes, there is only grilled cheese.  Once you move beyond these issues, Melt is a great place to eat.  The wait is long because people want to eat there.  The service is slow because there are a ton of people in the restaurant and the kitchen is about the size of a bathroom.  I have always had very friendly service.  It is not the server's fault that the kitchen works slow (again, see bathroom comment).  In other words, don't come to Melt if you are on a schedule.  I haven't had a sandwich there that I didn't like.  I also found out last time I was there that they will deep fry any sandwich for you!  Now, why you would want to do this, I don't know, but it is nice to know the option is there.    Realize what you are getting into when you go to Melt and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite at Melt today with my long time friend and our kids.  I ordered the fish sandwich with a side salad.  For my son, I ordered a cheeseburger and fries.  The wait staff was nice and tattooed and the ambience of this Melt was very nice.  We arrived around 11 AM and within a short while, the house was packed.  After about 20 minutes, our food arrived.  My fish sandwich with hushpuppies and cole slaw built in was obnoxiously big, but oh so tasty!  The fish was awesome!  It was a huge serving of who knows what kind of fish.  The hushpuppies could have been crunchier because they were in the middle of a sandwich absorbing moisture.  Anyway, it was all very tasty.  My arteries are a little upset at me now due to the overdose of bad cholesterol, but I'm hoping they get over it soon.  My house side salad was really a fully salad and it was tasty with Ranch dressing on it.  This isn't a place I plan dine often, but for fun, it's a great place to go.  I couldn't eat all of my food in one sitting!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat if you love burgers, grilled cheese, and beer. My favorites are the Chicken and Waffle and the July feature Firecracker chicken. Totally worth the wait! Now the wait time can be a little long, so stop at the bar, get a beer and enjoy waiting for a table. Best days are to go are lunch time and during the week. Weekends can be very busy."}
{"text":"Today marked my third try at Melt, with some coworkers for a long work-lunch. Unfortunately though for Melt, in my book, it marks 'three strikes, you're out' for the gourmet grilled cheese joint.      I'm a Clevelander through and through and as any unique, novel, and craft establishment opens up - I want to not just like it but love it.  I'm one of those people who sees my $$ as 'votes'.  If I love a place, I want it to succeed and grow and support the local economy, yadda yadda, all that stuff.       I wanted to like Melt, it seemed fun and inventive, and everyone else seems to love it.  I however, find it kitsch.  I've tried three very distinct and different items here (jalapeno popper, pizza roll, and pirogi themed sandwiches, respectively) yet each one tasted exactly the same to me.  All I tasted by a strong margin each time was butter and bread. Overwhelmingly butter and bread, with a minute hint of either spice, marinara, or potato based upon each one I had.  And I've left each time feeling gross, even if I only ate half of my meal.        In my opinion, Melt is by far the most over-hyped joint in CLE and has a loyal following due to the 'celebrity' of it.  I went to the original location when it first opened, again a couple years later, and now for the third time -hoping each bad experience was a fluke. Alas, not.        Take my review for what its worth, plenty of people love Melt as one can see from the reviews, and it's worth a try - even to discover you really don't like it, as I do."}
{"text":"Sandwich was good. Fries were excellent.  Kids ate the mac & cheese sandwich which they loved.  Huge portions.  Even though I didn't drink, their beer selection is excellent. BUT, 45 minutes to get seated and then ANOTHER hour to get our food. I don't have that kind of time or patience.  I like the whole menu on the album cover thing. That was cool."}
{"text":"The food is still great and the beer selection is still wonderful.  The sucky part, is that even with the expansion, you wait a crazy amount of time to sit down and when you get to your table, you wait a long time to get your food. I doubt this has anything to do with the servers (who are very friendly and do a great job). It's more likely due to kitchen size vs. volume. Maybe the change would change the quality. But whatever it is, it kind of makes it disappointing. You see all this space in the place from the expansion and the new section is usually closed (I have a close friend who prides himself on having eaten almost every sandwich on the menu, and he has been there several times since they added the new spot and it's never been open).  Regardless, if you prepare yourself for the wait, you'll be rewarded with tasty goodness. Four stars doesn't mean I don't love Melt."}
{"text":"Not going to get too in depth here - but the food was excellent and the beer selection was great.  I for one love sandwiches and all that, so I guess that makes sense.  Other than that cool atmosphere and not a bad place to have a meal at all.  Also, plenty of TVs to watch the game."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here several years ago when they first opened, I was blown away by how good it was.  I've eaten there 5 or 6 times since then over the years and it just doesn't taste good to m anymore.  Was I just caught up in the hype originally?  Who knows.  I've tried a variety of sandwiches, the latest one being the Monte Cristo.  The bread is so thick on all the sandwiches, almost making it hard to enjoy what's inside.  And the batter on the outside was over the top thick.  Although tasty, it was overwhelming the rest of the sandwich.  The french fries were soggy, greasy and cold.  I've had much better Monte Cristos at mom and pop diners for less money.  At peak times, the noise level is really high and unpleasant making it hard to converse easily with others at your own table.  Lots of people like this place so maybe it's just me.  Give it a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing!! The only bad thing about going here to eat is the long time you can expect to take in ordering your food. You will want to just eat the entire menu. Me and my co-worker decided to order 2 different sandwiches and then split them. Both of them were for sure on the top of my list for best food I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Yeah, there's a lot of hype and such about this place. Wait staff seems to be dead-on hipsterville. But those sandwiches... damn good. Damn good. YOu get a LOT of food for your money, comparatively."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I watch Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives (a lot). But through this program, I've discovered some of the best eats while traveling that I can imagine, the latest being Melt Bar and Grilled. I went to the Detroit Ave location as it was advertised as the 'original', so I felt it would be the best place to capture the experience where every sandwich is part of a larger, grilled cheese sandwich. Naturally, this eatery did not disappoint! We even went back a second time (the tell-tale sign of a great place, for us).  First, regardless of whichever delicious choice you make, each sandwich is served on tasty, thick sourdough. Coupled with a bountiful (and beautiful) amount of fries, I'd recommend wearing your \"big pants\" if you come to dine here. Don't say I didn't warn you!  Next, you should know in advance that they do not give straws for the drinks, unless asked for. As part of an ongoing green initiative, we learned that straws are available by request only. So please, don't think your server is off their game if they bring drinks sans suck sticks. (That's alliteration, Holmes).   Oh, the food. Oh my, the glorious food. On our first visit, I enjoyed a big 'ol Buffalo Chicken sandwich - \"Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken\". I made a slight cheese sub (blue cheese slaw AND crumbled blue cheese felt like a bit too much for my belly), but other than that I enjoyed it in it's thick, spicy, slaw-covered glory. Holy smokes was this terrific! The only drawback was I felt like I had an anvil in my midsection for the balance of the day (we went right when they opened at 11, to beat the advertised crowds).  I couldn't stop thinking of that amazing sandwich, so I successfully navigated a second run at this place two days later (navigation on par with Christopher Columbus, no doubt). To make you, the Yelp reader, fully understand how great this place is, I felt obligated to try an additional sandwich to verify my initial experience - I'm doing this for you, guys.   This time I decided upon the \"Parma, Italy\" sandwich. Again, served on thick sourdough and topped with romano cheese, this may have been a top 3 chicken parm sandwich for me. Learning from my previous experience, I actually left some of the fries on my plate so as to allow me to board my plane later in the date and not anchor it to the runway.  The only slight drawback I wanted to note is they do not use Heinz ketchup. I know, I know, ketchup is just ketchup......until it's NOT. But despite this, I still bestowed upon Melt, a 5-star review. I'm not Guy Fieri, but without his show, I would have never found this gem on our trip to Cleveland. So thank you, sunglass wearing, catch-phrase spewing, red car driving man. Thank you."}
{"text":"Got to love a restaurant dedicated to one of my favorite comfort foods.  Now I just need to find a restaurant that's nothing but mac & cheese.  Granted, there is a place near where I live that has an impressive list of that singular dish, but I digress.  Travelling for work again and got the recommendation for this place from both co-workers from where I live as well as the locals.  The menu is HUGE, almost too big with too many delicious sounding choices to pick from.  I kept bouncing back and forth between 3 and settled for the half chicken & waffle sandwich:  waffle, fried chicken breast, pepper jack cheese, sriracha butter, with maple syrup for dipping.  Based on the description, I thought maybe the waffles would make up the bread of the sandwich.  I was wrong...two huge pieces of bread with a quarter of a Belgian waffle between one of the pieces and the chicken.  The sandwich was huge, too big to actually pick up and eat.  I even tried to cut with a knife and fork and dip the piece in the provided syrup.  It all failed, so I just ended up drizzling the sandwich in the syrup and eating it with knife & fork that way.  It was a wonderful mix of salty and sweet, with a hint of spice.  I was definitely glad I snagged only the half sandwich.  I subbed in one of the monthly specials, cheesy romano cauliflower, for the fries.  Roasted cauliflower in a heavenly gooey cheese sauce topped with breadcrumbs.  Thumbs up all around.  I also nursed a hot cider alcoholic beverage before & during the meal.  It was everything I want in a winter holiday/Christmas beverage...sweet, tart and lots of warm cinnamon.  Hopefully I get to pay a visit to this place again soon to try one of the options I passed on."}
{"text":"I'll stop the world and Melt with you!  I admit, it was a bit cheesy to start this post about Cleveland's grilled cheese sensation \"Melt Bar & Grilled\" with a line from that tubular 80's song. And it was even more cheesy for me to describe it as \"cheesy.\" But everyone loves cheese! Which is what makes \"Melt\" such a smashing (seemingly overnight) success! Melt has taken our favorite childhood food staple and revoluntionized it! What used to be nothing more than two pieces of Wonderbread, a slice of Kraft Singles American cheese, and a side some Campbell's tomato soup has now become an artform with dozens and dozens of creative, wacky and delicious fixings.  Melt is constantly packed. Your wait at any given time is surely a minimum of an hour. That's if you're lucky. I have attempted to go to Melt with a group of 8 and was slapped with a whopping 3 hour wait. I've heard horror stories of people waiting up to 5 hours to hook their tastebuds up with gooey goodness. But, to them, it's anything but a horror story. These folks clamor that the wait is 100% worth it. Not everyone has that kind of time on their hands (me included), and so heading to Melt takes some preparation. Just make sure you have a couple of hours carved out of your day and you should be set. The smaller your group, the more likely you'll get in quicker. My successful trip to Melt was with a group of 4 and we were able to snag some stools at the bar after just a few minutes of waiting! This was a win/win situation, because I feel eating at the bar is even more fun than at a table!  The drink menu is massive. It's chock full of tons of local and import beers, wines and liquors, from the well-known to the obscure.   The real fun, of course, is deciding which of the masterpiece grilled cheese sandwiches you will choose for your dining experience at Melt. It took me a long while to sift through the mounting menu of mouthwatering choices (printed on the reverse of old album sleeves), but I ultimately went with the \"Parma, Italy\" (pictured above) which consisted of breaded chicken, provolone, garlic, and roasted red pepper pesto. It was everything I could ask for and more. The sides of sea-salted fries and cold and spicy coleslaw added to the perfection.   My choice was one of the more tamer of sandwiches that are available at Melt. I nearly ordered the \"Parmageddon\" which included 2 cheese and potato pierogis, sauerkraut, cheddar cheese and onions, and leaned also toward \"The Godfather\" that had three-cheese lasagna, provolone and red sauce. Not your typical grilled cheese sandwiches!  Fellow diners in my party ordered the \"Purple Parma\" (eggplant, tomato, pesto and provolone), the \"BBQ Chicken\" and the \"Chorizo and Potato.\" All were satisfied with their choices, with the eggplant getting the most praise of all.  Other menu highlights include grilled cheese burgers, The Lake Erie Monster (walleye on a grilled cheese), Municipal Stadium Magic (bratwurst on a grilled cheese), The Dude Abides (meatballs and mozzarella sticks on a grilled cheese), and The Northcoast Shores (crab cakes on a grilled cheese). What's also fun is that they do provide the option of getting a traditional grilled cheese for the non-adventure seeker; and the option of taking the \"5 Pound Challenge\" that was taken when the television show \"Man V. Food\" was filmed at Melt.  You will surely be stuffed after any item you order here, but if you somehow have a bit of room for dessert, go for the Fried Twinkies! You might have trouble walking out of the place due to the inevitable food baby you'll be carrying, but believe me, this is a dining discovery you will be dreaming about for years to come!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  No pics = no memory, but each sandwich is more than enough for three normal eaters. They are also very happy to combine any individual ingredients from one sandwich to another.   Sold spot to check out should you be trapped in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I think this place was way too hyped up...that it didn't rise to my expectations. 3.5 stars.  After waiting 1.25 hours to be seated at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon (yes, 3pm!), we sat down to order. My friend got the wake n bacon, and I got the smoky russian. After waiting another 30 minutes, our food came out. I mean, c'mon, it's a Sunday afternoon and your restaurant isn't THAT busy!  First, the sides on the plates. The fries were drenched with salt and pepper. BLEHHH. The coleslaw was one of the driest things I've ever tasted. BLEHHH. Then the sandwich! Don't get me wrong, the bread on it was great. But everything else? I didn't even think my gouda cheese was all that great..there was so little of it. I mean, isn't this suppose to be a grilled cheese place? It was just, overall, WAY too salty. My friend felt the same.  I was a tad disappointed with MELT. Why did it not live up to my expectations? Sure, they have a crazy amount of selection of beer and sandwiches, but still..... I just wasn't impressed. The quality of sandwiches....just wasn't that amazing. I'm kind of disappointed, Melt! Did I order the wrong item? :P"}
{"text":"This is the Cleveland equivalent of Primanti's in Pittsburgh. The sandwiches are HUGE. The walls are covered with fun stuff. The servers are friendly and funny.   I highly recommend arriving 30 minutes earlier than you had planned. The wait is usually long and the seating is somewhat limited. Plus, once you do get seated--with your snarky fake name tag--you'll need some time to digest the menu.   I chose to build my own sammich, which included two gargantuan fistfuls of bacon, two thick slices of tomato, and a wonderfully sharp cheddar; however, the menu offers 6+ types of cheese and probably two dozen different grilled cheese concoctions and burgers. The fries are equally as yummy, as are the pickles and slaw. Don't plan on drinks or dessert - the enormous portions will completely fill your tank.  If half your meal isn't on your face and falling apart on your plate, then you picked the wrong sandwich! This is a good stop for anyone passing through Cleveland."}
{"text":"We decided to try Melt based on the reviews and we were not disappointed. I had the Monte Cristo which was piled high with meat and served with a delicious berry sauce. My son had the Summer Chicken which he thoroughly enjoyed. We both left stuffed and satisfied. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Yeah. Enjoying the ultimate grilled cheese.  The buffalo chicken chowder is probably my most favorite soup ever.  I can't wait to try all of the different grill cheese sandwiches.  tonight i had the italian meatball, it was way to big for me to finish by myself.    be prepared to wait for a while if you arrive during normal lunch or dinner hours pretty much every night."}
{"text":"Ridiculous sandwiches that are ridiculously good. Knowledgeable staff, I'm in from out of town and they had a lot of great recommendations. The Monte Cristo is great, half sandwich is more than enough unless you want leftovers!"}
{"text":"Been to Melt twice. First time, tried their Lakewood location, which was very very busy - at least1 hr wait for 3 on a Friday night and this was 5 years back, before they became wildly popular. This time, went to the Cedar location with a group of three on a Friday night. I was expecting difficult to find parking and long waits but we were seated within 10 min and street parking surprisingly wasn't too bad. Service is meh,  but I'm not expecting a ton of great service like I would at restaurants like L'Albatros. We ordered a sandwich each. They all come with fries. Portion size is huge. The first time I came, I think I ordered a turkey flavor, which unsurprisingly, was not too flavorful. This time, ilet my friend pick, and she ordered all of us a Cuban War Pig, a shrimp po boy, and a potato chorizo sandwich. The cuban war pig was too meaty and gamey for me. The potato one was not flavorful enough, but the shrimp po boy was so delicious. The greens and dressing in the samdwic gave it a refreshing kick of flavor, and really does balance out the deep fried batter of the shrimp. Too much food, so we didn't end up gettimg dessert. There was enough leftovers for two more meals!"}
{"text":"Another Triple D! This place was such a blast! The staff was very friendly the, the atmosphere was inviting and laid back, and I loved the funky decor (plastic, light up, yard, Easter bunny, lite up over the bar).  They have a huge beer selection & a full bar.  We got the Parmagedon (pirogi grilled cheese) and the Peanut Butter Banana grilled cheese...yes grilled cheese!  Both of them we amazing but the peanut butter banana was over the top!  It was peanut butter, bananas, candied peanuts, sweetened cream cheese, bacon, (they asked me if I wanted it deep fried!! I passed but I imagine that would be insane!) and a mixed berry jam dipping sauce!  The tartness of the jam really balanced out the sweet of the sandwich.  I would absolutely order it again! The buffalo chowder was great and the hand cut fries had a ton of flavor.  Next time we'll save room for the fried twinkies!"}
{"text":"Great food and alot of it. Extensive bar with some great beers! Plan on a long wait tho!"}
{"text":"Experience. It's what Melt is and will always be about. Given the opportunity to open a restaurant where the consumer can reminisce about the days of being in kindergarten and coming in from building a snowman, relishing in the warm gooeyness of a grilled cheese (and tomato soup maybe?). My opinion: this is a great casual place to eat and enjoy life. If you are looking for an upscale 5 star gourmet restaurant, then go to another one of Cleveland's finest. I'm not saying this is chain style cafe; rather, it's a homegrown classic that you long for when you decide to embark on new adventures outside of the Midwest. This idea of grilled cheese is nothing beyond the spectacle of making your own, but that's not the reason it has grown into a Cleveland cultural phenomenon.   Melt has grown because of its devout followers. For peets sake! People have tattoos to commemorate this place, and it's brilliant. What better publicity than permanently marking yourself with a grilled cheese? I truly enjoy Melt and the delightful sandwiches it brings and I am willing to wait for one, but to those nay-sayers about such inconveniences Melt has created so much publicity that YOU also are willing to wait the two hours to sit in its unique environment celebrate the American culture that is the essence of Melt, lap up the generous options of beer on their list, and dive into the  1/2 foot tall sandwiches they offer-be it vegan, vegetarian, or full on carnivore- just to try something different from Cheesecake Factory. Just remember what you're going in for: grilled cheese, aka nothing short of a coronary. I have to say they are doing something right here.  I'm not going to change the opinion of everyone. Don't have 2 hours to burn? Don't like grilled cheese? Don't go here. It's as simple as that. But as an occasional Melt go-er, recognizing the brilliance behind an American classic that has become a tradition of Cleveland really, just like that million dollar idea of the sham wow, aren't you thinking: \"damn, wish I had thought of it first\"?"}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit in my opinion. Their sandwiches are GIANT and very yummy. No wonder it's always so busy every night. So plan to go before 4 or after 9 or 10 if you dont want to wait for an hour or something. I really liked the sun rise sandwich. It has shrimps and some veges in it, so it doesnt make me as sick afterwards as other options do..  They also have this \"melt challenge\" where if you can finish 5lbs of food with 13 different kinds of cheese, you will be on their record and will win a 10 dollar gift card and a cool tshirt. One of my friends from Chicago actually was training to do this challenge before he came, and we got to this place pretty late, and we said that we want to do it! the waitress was like you know, it takes about 45 mins to prepare and you know 5 lbs of cheese is not that delicious and it's actually rather disgusting. I have only seen one person who won the challenge and she's a small lady. And yes the waitress finally convinced my friend to save this $50 and go with a yummy sandwich instead. I kinda laughed cuz I thought she just wanted to go home early. LOL"}
{"text":"WOW!  I don't even really like grilled cheese sandwiches but WOW!    I ordered the summer grilled cheese and I'm still having dreams about it.  It's a good thing I don't live in Cleveland because I'd be REALLY fat if I lived anywhere near this place.    Also amazing: they cater to vegans!  Melt offers a vegan mozzarella and a vegan cheddar cheese that can be added to any sandwich.    Beware: the portions are HUGE!  I was only able to eat half of the sandwich and a few fries.  It did make a great dinner, tho.  This place uses great, quality, fresh ingredients that you can taste in every bite.    The one con: There will be a 1+ hour wait regardless of what time you go and they don't take reservations.  I made use of this by putting my name down and then walking down the street to caribou coffee.  When I got back my name was next on the list.  So be prepared to wait alittle but trust me it will be worth it."}
{"text":"I don't like to wait in line for much. Movies, sporting events, bathrooms, the receiving line at a wedding: all are made immeasurably worse by having to wait in a line to enjoy them.   So believe me when I say this: waiting for an hour just to eat a sandwich isn't something I usually sign up for. But Melt, you get a lifetime pass.  I am not from Cleveland, nor do I reside in the Cleveland area, but I find myself there at least once a year on business. And to me a trip to The Cleve without a meal at Melt is like a trip to Paris without seeing the Eiffel Tower.   Aside from the food, the place does absolutely nothing to win me over personally. It is a haven for hipsters, a group I share little in common with besides a love of thrift stores. It has a large beer selection but not especially great bar prices. Their fries are nothing to rave about. The parking situation is less than ideal. And there is often quite a line at any reasonable meal time.   But it simply doesn't matter. The sandwiches, my friend. Oh Lord, the sandwiches!   I found myself in town this week, and drove after work downtown like a madman to arrive before the 11pm Monday closing time. I was about to drive 420 miles back to Milwaukee that night, and could not let my trip to Cuyahoga County pass without a visit to Melt.   Now, I have eaten the delicious peanut butter and banana sandwich, and several other offerings as well. They are all spot-on, and all are priced south of the $10 mark. And believe me, they'll all take you to flavor country.  But allow me to be blunt. If you're a man, you'll order the Monte Cristo with bacon. And by \"man\" I don't mean biologically. I mean, if you like football, eat nachos, buy the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, and/or can open an import beer bottle with your eye socket,  you will adore this piece of sandwichilogical prowess.   But even if you're just a poor facsimile of a man like myself, you'll still want to eat half the sandwich and marry the other half. The twin meats. The twin cheeses. Bacon thick like bathroom tile. French toast. Then you deep fry the entire thing.   They've done to the Monte Cristo what the Dallas Cowboys did to Jumbotrons. It's decadent and nearly uncalled-for. A triumph. Thank you Melt, and may your grill never grow cold."}
{"text":"Great for vegans because they have a vegan cheese option--and it's good, too! Very rare and welcome.  Most of their meat sandwiches can be made vegetarian--they use well-prepaired seitan (wheat gluten) instead of the meat.  Not so good for gluten-free... too bad. They could offer a gluten-free bread choice. They do at least let you bring your own gluten-free bread for them to use, but that seems like a halfway solution.  The food is very good, but I only go occasionally when I'm really hungry! It's terrible for you! Lots of carbs, lots of fat. I love it! But not all the time. Maybe they have healthy options, but that's not why I go to Melt. I go for huge greasy vegetarian sandwiches and great seasoned fries.  They lose a star because the wait can be surprisingly long, and because you sometimes get packed in elbow-to-elbow with strangers, and because parking is very limited, and requires quarters. Go at off hours to avoid these problems. I have not had a problem once seated: service has been fine."}
{"text":"Pros: - The food was terrific. My family got grilled cheese sandwiches, which is of course their specialty. They were not too greasy, but full of flavour and completely stuffed. - Large American portions! As a Canadian, I'm not really accustomed to ginormous amounts of food. My Backyard BBQ grilled cheese was huge, as well as my serving of fries. Unless you've just finished fasting, you'll probably have leftovers. - The service was great. The servers were attentive, very friendly and offered reassurance when the food was taking a while (see below). - Atmosphere was casual and comfortable. There were multiple screens showing sports (or kids shows), along with purposefully tacky decor that fit the general vibe of the place.  Cons: - Prepare to wait for your food if they're busy. We probably waited around half an hour for our food after we ordered, which was rather annoying. Good thing they had one of their TVs showing cartoons for the kids.  Overall: Fun place to have belly-busting sandwiches, but you might have to wait for them."}
{"text":"What can I say, they are unrivaled in their preparation of multiple different selections on takes of grilled cheese sandwiches. Their sandwiches are enormous and can definitely feed two."}
{"text":"I headed to Melt with a couple of friends last Saturday @ 6pm, having been to all of the Melt locations I knew going into it the wait would be LONG. We got their and surprisingly the wait time stated was 45 minutes but was actually only 15, score!  We sat down with our beers from the bar (I had my standard IPA, good as always). Our waitress came quickly and was very friendly. I've frequented Melt locations ever since the original Lakewood location was opened and tried various sandwiches. The only original sandwich I have never had was the Parmageddon (pierogies in a grilled cheese) but was informed that they were out of pierogies.  I opted for the \"Cheese Steak\" style grilled cheese (with peppers, onions, provolone, hold the mushrooms). I will say this wasn't my favorite sandwich on the menu but it was good. I really enjoyed the rosemary onion aioli sauce that was on the sandwich. The fries on the side were exceptional this time as sometimes from past experiences they have been soggy.   The decor of Melt is wacky and hipster-esque. Beards galore, craft beers, tattoos and the HUGE sandwiches. It's hard to review Melt, as I have been here over 10 times. I've had good sandwiches (the Dude Abides, Monte Cristo, Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken) and bad sandwiches (the hot Itallan, Winter Chicken). This time overall was a 4 because we had great service, food was out fast and tasted good but I will give a 3 overall for the times I've waited over an hour and a half, had soggy fries and for not having pierogies like I wanted!   Give it a try if you never had it before or if you're visiting Cleveland but be ready for a LARGE meal and button bursting on your pants.   PS. I prefer the Independence location as it is the largest of the 3 in Cleveland. Lakewood has the original charm but you are walking on top of people in that location and I don't care for the east side Coventry locations setup."}
{"text":"I am not from Cleveland but came here with co workers. I was at first disappointed because I wanted to eat healthy. However, I was blown away with their menu and food items.   I got a gluten free cheeseburger and a side salad. I went basic but my coworkers ordered their speciality grilled cheese items and wow!!! Huge portions. Very creative items.   They have a big beer selection. I was quite impressed.   I recommend going here if you are starving and want a sandwich."}
{"text":"Good, but the hype is a little much.  You leave smelling like greasy texas toast and feeling like a possible heart attack coming on.  The wait is just silly.  I (and 2 others) rudely made me way into the bar squishing the couple next to me hogging their spot at the bar eating dessert.  I don't know how anyone has room for dessert after that mass of bread and cheese but whatever, it's America.  We're fat."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend once for his birthday lunch. Firstly, this is not a place to go to when you're on a diet. I'm tickled to death at all their crazy concoctions of sandwiches and they all seem really good, just be careful if you're conscious about what you eat (or at least take advantage of the vegan options). The record album covers as menus thing was pretty cool and the prices aren't too terrible. I ordered the Dudes Abides (spelling?) whereas my boyfriend chose a non-specialty sandwich. We did not appreciate our waitress trying to coax him into ordering something else when he clearly stated what he wanted, that was very unprofessional. I understand the atmosphere is supposed to be edgy and modern, but that's no excuse. Otherwise, the service was alright. I'd go back and give it another try sometime if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"Server was great. Environment was great. I ordered the Parmageddon which is a potato and onion pierogi. I thought it was okay, not as flavorful as I thought. The sandwich was huge and came with fries. It was a little messy but worth it. Definitely would go back to try something different. I like places that bring a lot of food and this place didn't disappoint. If you want lots of food, come here."}
{"text":"If I didn't watch what I eat, I would totally eat here everyday! A very laid back and colorful place to grab a quick burger/sandwich and a drink. Arrive early on the weekends as this place gets busy!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this was the very first melt ever built, but this is where my journey with this chain began, and I'm so glad it did!! The sandwiches are HUUUGE and so so delicious, definitely get something different every time you go! You'll Never leave hungry!"}
{"text":"If you're open minded to sandwiches, then I would definition recommend this place. The mighty macaroni has to be the most cheesiest sandwich there, next to the melt challenge. Personally I enjoy the mom's meatloaf dinner and the monte cristo. Don't be fooled. These sandwiches are pretty big, so I would recommend coming on an empty stomach.   The staff was very friendly, especially the bartenders. Every month they have a special sandwich, beer, cocktail, bread pudding, and so much more."}
{"text":"On a quick trip to visit a friend in a Cleveland hospital - this place was recommended to us by pretty much ALL the staff and it also popped up on Yelp as the best place for late night eats in the area.  Both steered us right!    I love me a grilled cheese  ... or pretty much anything with cheese on it .... so I was delighted.  The menu has a lot of options, and while some did not necessarily feel like a spin off the traditional grilled cheese, I could see how there was def something for everyone.  I would have appreciated some more gourmet options ... but that's my NYC mind talking.   We decided to split one of the Specials - which was a traditional Thanksgiving dinner type of sandwich.  Turkey with Havarti and stuffing and a cranberry something.  It was really good.  What I loved was that we said we would split it and it came already split with our own fries.  I'm assuming a lot of people do it there.  The sandwich was huge and very filling.    We started with the melt pierogis and some vodka - which really hit the spot after a long day and drive!"}
{"text":"Very cool place, server (Dan) was very helpful, and did a great job.  Seems like a very trendy, younger crowd and it was very busy the whole time I was there. Got the Prime Time Special which was amazing, and they offerered just the right condiments/additions to it to give it amazing flavor and taste that was really great.  The Ultimate Fries were just okay, but sandwich and service was great."}
{"text":"I am a tattoo family member. One of the first 100. They have gone so far down hill it's incredible. The bread is always soggy. The fires undercooked. The servers rude on another level. This place peaked 4 years ago. I got my tattoo covered. Never going back. Not worth the wait or your time. It's a shadow of its former self."}
{"text":"Contrary to other reviewers, this is NOT your average grilled cheese place. I didn't find it to be overpriced either. The sandwiches are HUGE, more than enough to make two meals out of. The three of us dining each ordered something different, we sampled the Peanut Butter & Banana, The Lake Erie Monster, and the Monte Cristo. All of these sandwiches were great, but the Monte Cristo was our favorite. The slaw they serve on the side was a bit peppery, but I actually enjoyed it and I am not a huge fan of slaw. The fries were home-made and crispy. I honestly can't wait to go back to this place. The atmosphere is fun, and our waitress was fantastic. We were told the wait would be an hour to and hour and a half, but ended up only waiting about 45 minutes. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow. An awesome gluttonous meal. Great beer, Grilled cheese larger than yer head, and fantastic service. A cheese lover's paradise. The fried twinkies are worth the trip alone. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Killer grub! Cleveland has a hit here!  The menu is pretty diverse and even offers vegetarian options. I was torn between two sandwiches and before ordering I asked what the bigger selling items were. When the Hot Wet Buffalo Chicken sandwich was mentioned I knew it was a 'go' as it was one I had been considering.  Wow! What a great pile of food! I took one bite of the sandwich and though I had chipped a tooth- turns out it was the super-crisp breading on the chicken. I was super impressed how crisp it was from first bite to last. Ample portions of seasoned fries and a vinegar-slaw accompany your sandwich.  I thought I knew what I was getting into so I hadn't eaten all day. Sadly, I couldn't finish every bite of deliciousness put in front of me."}
{"text":"My sister and i went to this for the first time.  Nice, fun, kitschy atmosphere and pleasant efficient service, but after that, meh.  Their slaw is extremely dry, in fact, there's no dressing; the fries look much better than they taste as they were not crispy or flavorful.  I had a smoked gouda with bacon and tomato sandwich and u could barely taste the smoke or the gouda...tasted more like cheddar with a hint of smoke and the bacon was fatty and the tomato tasteless.  I liked the texas toast, which is the only bread for their sandwiches, but it would be nice to have other options, especially when the whole menu is already limited by stuff with cheese.  The other entree was a turkey sandwich with similarly disappointing results.  When it first comes to the table, u think wow, then the taste just doesn't measure up.  The menu appears creative and imaginative, but unfortunately, not the results."}
{"text":"I have a couple of friends that frequent and rave about Melt like it's the second coming of Christ, so when I was in the area to visit them, we decided upon Melt for dinner; because in their words \"we have to try it\".  It was recommended to me that for my first Melt experience that I go with the straight grilled cheese.  What arrived was a large \"grilled cheese\" consisting of basic bread, soggy from grease, barely toasted, and a boat load of fries.   Taste was second rate, comparable to a greasy spoon diner.  For a place that supposedly serves \"gourmet grilled cheese\", my expectations were high.  I expected artisan breads, blends of cheeses creating a unique flavor, touches like heirloom tomato, and prepared using proper technique (like actually grilling the sandwich till its toasted).  What I received was none of that and is barely memorable.  From what I can tell, Melt is nothing more than hyped up bar food focused on quantity, not quality.  The grilled cheese spin is a gimmick no different than Panini's putting french fries in a sandwich.  By the way, the restaurant is more akin to a Panini's than anything even remotely higher class.  Food & Wine just put together a list of the top 25 best grilled cheese sandwiches in America, and Melt didn't make the list.  Ironically, Lola made the list with one of their sandwiches and they not even a grilled cheese specialty shop (#21 out of 25).  This should tell you something about the quality of Melt's food:   http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-grilled-cheese-in-the-us      If you're a simpleton whose primary objective in life is to fill up your obese gut on greasy bar food while slugging down a beer, this place is for you.  Fortunately, I am none of those things and consequently I will never return (unless I'm dragged there against my will).  I was going to rate this place one star, but as long as I compare it only against its closest competitors ( bar food joints), it rates a little better.  Note: my friends keep on telling me that the Cedar location of Melt has numerous quality control issues and that the only way to really experience Melt is to go to the original Lakewood location.  They say it has something to do with Matt Fish not being physically there and that the line cooks and employees have a don't care attitude. I'm open to give it a shot again if I'm in the Lakewood area, but Melt sure as hell has a high threshold to cross after being so lousy the first time."}
{"text":"I've been going to MELT for years now and it gets better every time! You better be prepared to eat because the amount of food you receive is insane!"}
{"text":"Where do you go when you want to smash a few thousand calories in cheesy, bready, chewy goodness? Well, Melt of course!  The food is generally quite inventive. Something new and intriguing yet comfortably familiar. Overall the food is pretty much in the \"amazing\" category. The bevvy selections are something to text home about, too.  But where it loses me is in the atmosphere. No, it's not the eclectic holiday decorations and randomness on the walls (including the pretty wicked local celebrities mural). It's the uncomfortably loud and obnoxious atmosphere. I guess that's why I don't frequent sports bars; I like to be able to have a conversation with whomever I'm dining. And to wait over an hour for my decadent melty sandwich with my friends and family, only to be drowned out by music and raucous patrons is off-putting.  So, if you call for takeout, or do the uber eats or whatever it's probably going to upgrade your dining experience from a 3 to a 5. Unless you enjoy not being able to talk to your relatives...that's always a possibility."}
{"text":"This four star rating comes with some warnings/suggestions:  The sandwiches here are great, you just have to order the right one. I would recommend sticking with something that is based on deli meat. They also have a good selection of beer and a big bar to occupy you while you wait for a table.  This being said, there is a long wait, which seems in part due to non-efficient service and lack of tables (note all the dead space by the bar). My first of two experiences here we had a large group, for which they only had one table to seat us. We had to wait 2 and a half hours for the other party to leave the table before we could sit down.  I would recommend coming with a small group of people and then sit and order at the bar."}
{"text":"I must eat some cheese. We had ages to decide. Monte Cristo?  Yes.   Ommmmmmm"}
{"text":"I am beginning to suspect that the owners of Melt are trying to kill me by introducing monthly sandwich specials that could kill an elephant.  By that I mean that they are over the top calorically, and chock-full of deliciousness.  The regular menu items I have tried have been great, but August's Pig Roast, December's Mighty Macaroni Melt (tied with the Buckeye Beer Engine's Fatty Melt for the title of most preposterous sandwich), and this month's Corny Beast are all not to be missed concoctions.    The fries are generally very good, and the slaw has a nice kick to it.  The specialty vegetables and soups can be great too, but might not appeal to all tastes.  Aside from that, the fried twinkies are a nice meal topper should your bottomless pit of a stomach not be filled by one of their gigantic sandwiches.  The wait times can be ridiculous, but that is really just a simple case of supply and demand.  If I have the urge to go, I make sure to get there as soon as they open if I don't feel like waiting. I cannot stress this enough-If you get there between 11-11:15AM, you will have you pick of tables, by noon, the place will be packed.   I love the atmosphere.  It's got the heart and soul of a dive-bar without the filth.  Melt is one of those places that you need to take out of town visitors.    This is the kind of place that makes Cleveland great."}
{"text":"A very strange thing happened to me about 24-hours after my inaugural visit to Melt......I started craving grilled cheese. Not grilled cheese in a general sense...but THIS grilled cheese specifically. It started to permeate my unconscious thoughts and dreams.   So, that either means Melt's sandwiches are truly exceptional in some not-so-obvious way that was only revealed to me the next day, or they are lacing their sandwiches with crack cocaine.   (Either theory could correctly predict the outcome of Melt's excessive popularity.)  I may need to conduct further experiments...."}
{"text":"Great ambience - lively, active, good looking bar seating.  Very nice service. Overly greasy food.  My gallbladder had to work over time for this meal.  It seemed like a college rugby frat designed the menu."}
{"text":"I ve eaten there once, a couple of years ago. nice place, HUGE portions. typical american food, great burgers and sandwitches, reasonable prices, friendly stuff. I would go again for sure!"}
{"text":"WOW these sandwiches are good. I lived in the Cleveland area for most of my life, but for some reason I had never been to a Melt before.   When we got there during late lunchtime there was a 45 minute wait, but the huge bar gave us something to do while we waited. I would recommend looking through the many choices of grilled cheese sandwiches while you wait, so you're not left staring at the many combinations when it's time to order.  While you're waiting for your food to be brought out, be prepared to stare at every other person's plate and be very, very jealous. Each sandwich is oozing with cheese and assorted fillings, and are absolutely massive. I got the Cleveland cheesesteak and it was incredible. I'm usually not a slaw fan, but the slaw they serve with their sandwiches is very fresh and peppery and very tasty. I finished about half of mine and took the rest home, which seems to be what everyone does.  Great place, great food. If you're feeling particularly brave, you can do the Melt Challenge, for $30 you get about 3 pounds of cheese between 3 pieces of bread, and tons of fries and slaw. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Watching man versus food Cleveland Ohio melt bar and Grill old that's all I have to say this place is awesome so awesome I got a grilled chez sammy  tattoo"}
{"text":"Sooooo many options for vegetarian food. I'm not from Cleveland, but I will drive to Cleveland specifically for Melt."}
{"text":"I had the Rising Sun. One of the best sandwiches ever with perfectly seasoned fries and an Ace pineapple cider. Very relaxed and friendly server. A great experience."}
{"text":"First time here, will probably come back.   I think that their food is decent and I like their choices on the menu (and there are alot).    We came during happy hour and they have some very good specials.   I did opt for a draft drink, but then found out it was not on special (I think they could do some clarification on their menu)....   but other than that we didn't really partake.  I got a monte cristo.   It is the kind that has very thick bread and is much like a french toast grilled cheese.  It isn't my preference for a monte cristo, but it was good.  My major complaint is there wasn't much \"stuff\" in the sandwich.  There was too much bread.    My husband got a philly, which looked very good.  Fries were good and our appetizer was also very good.  I think their prices are a little high for what you get, but they do provide a unique atmosphere and great service.    But, this is something to keep in mind.  Also the hipster game is strong at this place...."}
{"text":"So I'm from New Jersey and I've never heard of this place before. My three brothers and I were on a road trip returning from a trip to Cedar Point for my brother's bachelor party. My oldest brother had friends in the area that raved about this place, so he convinced us to go and meet up with his friend for lunch. Boy am I glad he did!  I'm a vegetarian and a road trip with fast food constantly left me with not a lot of options. I am however very happy to say this place offers the largest variety of vegetarian and vegan options available I've seen in a long time. Being a grilled cheese place that may have been a given, but they go out of their way to be accommodating and mention on the menu they'll try their best to make you happy  They have a handy legend on their menu, 'Vegetarian', 'Vegetarian Option Available' and 'Vegan Option Available'. So the majority of their sandwiches and be made specially to order to accommodate your needs.  I ordered the Parma, Italy sandwich with breaded tofu (instead of chicken) and it was... phenomenal! Even I was surprised, the tofu was delicious, the toppings were great, the bread was awesome and the fries and slaw were good! (even though I mostly stuck to the fries). I was so satisfied.  Being a long way from home I knew I wouldn't be able to have something this good for a long time. I took my time and saved half of my sandwich for later. I gave my girlfriend in NJ a call and asked if she wanted anything. She got the vegan version of my sandwich (with vegan cheese). The waitress, who was vegan, noted the tofu may have butter or eggs in the breading (she was unsure) and the bread was not vegan (due to the butter I think). So that's good to note. I'm not sure if they may be able to have non-breaded tofu or even have the bread without the butter, the thought escaped me. I was too busy enjoying my sandwich. But it wouldn't hurt to ask, and I don't see why not.  My three brothers and my brother's friend all enjoyed their meals (with some take-out bags filled with precious leftovers). They also have a fun little gift shop by the register with t-shirts, posters, pins and more.  I wish this place existed closer to me... but maybe it's best it does not (health-wise). However if I am ever in Ohio again, I'll be sure to come back to the Melt.  If you have the chance to give this place a try do your self a favor and DO IT! You'll be very glad you did."}
{"text":"Monthly specials are typically to die for, seriously they'll give you a heart attack! I've enjoyed just about every sandwich on the menu and never went wrong! These are legit melts/ grilled cheese!!"}
{"text":"The only word that comes to mind for me when I think of Melt is 'overdone.'  they just try to put too much cheese and stuff together on a sandwhich to the point where it ruins it for me.  Call me crazy, but I just don't eat here anymore.  Whenever I see the sign for it, I can feel a 10 pound brick of cheese in the bottom of my stomach that reminds me \"Don't do that again!\""}
{"text":"I love this crazy sandwich place! This location is great because it has parking. I would not recommend the Cedar Rd. one because the roads are jenk and there's no parking lot. Melt should take reservations because the average wait time is crazy. Pass the time by staring deeply into other people's ginormous orders :).  The variety of sandwiches is through the roof good! I've gotten the Monte Cristo and the Chicken n' Waffles. The Monte Cristo is 5 stars. Deep fried, powdered sugared and cranberry dipped goodness. The chicken and waffles was a load of carbs. The thick pieces of bread should have been substituted with waffles instead--isn't that a novel idea? Can't complain about the large-ass piece of chicken though. Enough for two HUGE meals. My mom ordered the Korean war pig which she loved. My mom usually hates sandwiches/burgers and is one of the pickiest eaters I know. This sandwich passed her test.   The staff are always friendly (for it being the hopping place it is) and the interior of the restaurant is surprisingly roomy.  My only suggestion? Open a branch in Pittsburgh! Primanti Bros ain't got nothing on Melt!"}
{"text":"I used to love Melt up until recently when they started downsizing the portions and jacking up the prices. My favorite sandwich to get is the Cleveland Cheese Steak. I usually order it vegan. I am not vegan; however, I like the taste better. This sandwich used to be $12. Then it went up to $14.50 some months back. The menu has just changed again, and the sandwich is now $15. They offer half portions now, which I thought was pretty cool at first until I realized that a half portion of a sandwich is the same cost as what they used to charge for a whole sandwich. They charge extra for the vegan version, so that makes the sandwich that I like a whopping $19.50. I'm sorry, but I am not willing to pay that much for a sandwich. Also, the Wild Tofu Wings used to be $8. They are now $10, smaller, and no longer come with celery. People used to say to me, \"Melt is so expensive.\" And I would tell them, \"No, it's not. You get a huge sandwich, coleslaw, and fries for like $12!\" You don't get coleslaw anymore, and the prices are getting ridiculous. I've also learned that Melt has strayed away from buying fresh ingredients locally (the chicken is from Tyson, the fries are frozen), and their staff is not treated very well. That is pretty disappointing. Sorry, Melt, but I'm breaking up with you."}
{"text":"I gave the 4 stars only because my friends insisted... I would have given a three mostly because of the incredibly slow service when there were not too many tables taken. It took forever for us to get our drinks, it took foooooorever for us to get our food... It's just sad...FYI, we went there around 9pm on a Sunday  As for the food, the black cat really blows my mind, the fish was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was just right. I really like the spicy kick. As for the big fat gyro meatloaf, I didn't enjoy it as much, but still a decent sandwich."}
{"text":"This is truly one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. They have great food and there are even vegan/vegetarian options (good for moi). Sometimes the wait can be a while (bring a book) and what they show on the TV can sometimes be annoying (I had to sit through 3 hours of Fraggle Rock). Overall, though, it is still a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place was overrated.  The wait for a table was too long so we got food to go.  There were so many photos of different sandwiches on yelp that I tried to order, most of them they said they don't have any more.  Finally I decided on a special, it was like a pile of mush, very disappointed.    Prices are pretty typical, service was average."}
{"text":"I've had several amazing sandwiches here.  If you manage to have space for anything else, the fries are great and I like the cole slaw with a bit of malt vinegar splashed on it.  The last sandwich I had was the one weekend only Breakfast Club.  It truly was amazing, savory, delicious (and HUGE).  I do have a couple criticisms, one being that the service isn't that great and waiting isn't fun and I believe they could add more tables and use the space a bit more efficiently (but they'd have to expand the kitchen).  Anyways, affordable delicious food and awesome beer selection for the win."}
{"text":"Melt has been a Cleveland favorite for a while, and I was excited when one opened in Mentor. It seems that nobody in Mentor really cares for it though, as there's never that many people there. There's always a long wait at the Melt in Cleveland Heights, but I can always get in at the one in Mentor (which is fine with me).   I love making my own grilled cheese, and usually get havarti, sundried tomatoes, and arugula. I keep it simple. Except the last time I was there, they had taken havarti off of the menu and that is crazy because havarti is the perfect cheese for a grilled cheese sandwich. PLEASE BRING BACK THE HAVARTI. Thanks.  Also, great selection of beers."}
{"text":"We tried to go here before but we weren't going to wait for an hour so we went elsewhere.  Thankfully we got in just before the raging crowds.  (aka- 15 minutes after opening)  I got the Porky Cheese (ham, bacon and swiss) and the hubby ordered the Monte Cristo (turkey, ham, cheddar & american cheeses egg battered and grilled)  He decided to order a salad first and ordered the garlic dressing the waiter said \"you don't want that.\"  He's like \"uhhh, ok.\"  The waiter tells him it's better as a sauce and not a dressing.  Um, he's eaten spam musubi and esgargot, I think he can handle garlic dressing.  Why would you list something that didn't make a good dressing for a salad?  So ranch it was and a leery first impression.  The staff was nice, the place was loud for no reason (the music wasn't too loud but everyone was screaming) and the food was fine.  The monte cristo was soggy though, the sandwich halves are stacked so the steam took away any hint of crunch.  The hubby said he wouldn't get it again but liked mine)  I would probably get a straight up grilled cheese if I went back.  I ended up picking off my bacon and I love bacon.  I think perhaps the chatterbox teenager beside us was making me want to speed the visit along.  Maybe it's because we have a similar place where I'm from (though admitedly with less options) that we weren't overly bowled over.  It was good I just know I wouldn't go back if there was a wait because when it comes down to it, it's grilled cheese.  It's one of those places you have to go just to say you have.  Plenty to choose from including burgers if grilled cheese isn't your thing."}
{"text":"In the first few years that Melt was open, people would wait 3 hours for a table. Often times, after the \"new\" wears off a Novelty restaurant the service or quality tends to decline as well. That's not the case with the Melt. And as far as novelty well this is way more genuine than that!  The menu is thoughtful and spansive and the food is just as delicious and exciting as it was when they first opened up. The service is great.  I hadn't been in a while so it took me a bit to decide what to eat. I went with the Cuban which was delicious. My husband had the Cowabunga and he said it was very good. Ummm, pizza rolls in a sandwich? How could it not be?!  Melt continues to provide a perfectly Cleveland experience and I will continue to patron them!"}
{"text":"The Melt is a little overhyped for me. The sandwiches are certainly big and creative, but I only really like a few. The Thanksgiving and the Cuban sandwiches (I don't remember the exact names) are really good. The vibe and service are just ok for me. There are other spots in the area that I prefer."}
{"text":"You better walk into this place hungry and if you're on a diet, make it a cheat day. Loved everything about this restaurant. The food portions are huge but worth it. They have a ton of items to choose from with something for everyone. If you're a beer drinker they will likely have something to tickle your fancy, craft soda kinda of person? Yup, they have something to satisfy that need also. The decor was peculiar but brought a sense of nostalgia when you looked around. The wait staff was friendly and helpful and just an overall pleasant experience. :-)"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are huge, menu is creative, and you'll always find something good unless you don't like food. If you don't like food, then this is not the place for you. Even if you won't want a gigantor sandwich, they have fantastic soups, salads and small plate appetizers.   I like that they now sell half portions if you don't want to have leftovers, which are guaranteed with full potion. This last visit I had the Bushwood Club with turkey, bacon, tomato, lettuce and rosemary aioli - pretty good. My favorites are the Monte Cristo and Fried Green Tomato BLT with regular bacon (the default it seared pork belly).   Love their monthly specials - my mom tried this month's General Tso's, she took five bites and was beyond full. I tried it and thought the flavors were yummy, but it was a little much (although sometimes I think that's the intention). They always make good fried chicken - super plump, moist and delicious.   This location and the others in area have a really good beer selection. Also, I love their posters, old album cover menus and kitschy interiors. Service is always friendly and quick.   Still wish they did't take the Diablo burger off menu, but other than that, five stars. Keep up the good work, Melt."}
{"text":"Certainly my fav bar to go to and late night eat! Food is delicious n so different ! U can't get anything melt anywhere ! The staff are always friendly and nice :) the atmosphere is vibrant ... Family friendly n also good to hang out with friends or date ! I truly love this place !!"}
{"text":"I think this place is trying to imitate their restaurant in Lakewood - but it doesn't make it. The reason is that it has higher ceilings and the noise level is deafening. It doesn't have the ambiance that the one in Lakewood has - they think that displaying plastic lawn ornaments is considered \"decorating\" - it isn't. Every single person who works there is tatooted to the hilt. WHY? I think it's distracting. I want to listen to what they are saying, but all I concentrate on is why did they do that to their body??? It's just not attractive."}
{"text":"Ate here last week - the half portion sandwich was MORE than enough.  The fries were delicious!!!!!  The Gyro sandwich I had was actually very good - I'd get it again.  The service was nice and the beer was cold.  Didn't have to wait for a table.  It's a nice bar type setting - the only weird thing is the decor:  they have all these plastic holiday light up thing all over."}
{"text":"While many people rave about Melt, I am not its biggest fan. Yes, the food is good and fresh--- but SO MUCH BREAD! I understand it is based on grilled cheese, but a meal here is just as expensive as a good Italian dinner here in town--- which I would much prefer."}
{"text":"First, I'd like to start off by saying that we absolutely LOVE the food at Melt!! Unfortunately, our love for the food is not stronger than the dislike for the HORRIBLE service at this location! We are only ten minutes from the Mentor location, but will now always drive about 20 minutes to go to a location in Cleveland. Have been to this Melt several times and am always so disappointed by the service! Took my three small kids in there today after a doc appointment and we were treated so poorly. There was also a misunderstanding about the price to add on a soup and salad instead of fries and the manager was not willing to make it right. So sad. The $3.50 was not a big deal to me, but it was the principle of the matter. Have been there several times and have probably only had good service about once. A real bummer. I wish the management that is higher up would make some big changes to the staff there. If I've been treated so poorly on several occasions, how many others are being treated like this, and how many of us won't be back because of it? A lot of money being flushed. Too bad. :-( I'm giving it two stars because the food is still great! :-) Definitely worth the drive to Cleveland to get better service, though. I was beyond upset when I left there with my little ones! My husband was even more upset when I told him what happened to us. Bad business! :-/"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh - so glad I was hungry when I arrived, because there was tons of juicy melty goodness on my plate when my order was served! I ordered the Cuban War Pig - a whole sandwich, and I was stuffed half way through. But it was absurdly good and I didn't want to stop eating.  Call me crazy, but the bread was the best part. An amazing sandwich needs amazing bread and Melt does it right. Kudos also go to the hand cut fries - seasoned perfectly.  I loved the decor, and the very friendly staff. We arrived at about 2 for lunch, and had no problem getting a table immediately. We had two young growing boys in our party - tired and hungry from the day of shopping, and lunch from the kid's menu and they loved their meals. I would say their meals were quite generous too."}
{"text":"We took our whole family to Melt this past week. We loved everything except for the fries. The fires were greasy and a ball of potatoes. But, the sandwiches were stellar. The Monte Cristo is one of my favorites. The atmosphere was fun as well. Total must visit."}
{"text":"*2 1/2 stars*  When yelpers mention there's a wait... boy was there a wait. If waiting was an Olympic sport, I'd win the gold twice!  Great friends decided to make a 24hours stop in Cleveland en route back to Boston. Checked in at Melt- 6:15PM. Quoted wait- 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Actual time- 3 hours. (True story) The rational- 'we waited this long..we just CAN'T leave?!!' Another 15 mins, became 30 mins, became another hour! The longer we waited the longer we were determined to get our table... it was like Modern Warfare 2.  Hunger pangs knocks us over, delirium sets in...we finally got our table! Ordered foods STAT! Another 35mins before any food touched the lips. Left the restaurant traumatized with cramped stomachs.   Ordered- blacken chicken (good), 3 bean chili with grilled chicken (okay), the porky (friend A says 'too salty') and winter chicken (friend B says 'chicken was burned), and fried twinkee for dessert (disappointment- 3 breading balls battered and fried with oozed cream on the side, sat on a bed of pureed berries-not the actual twinkee we wanted).  Group consensus- the food ranged from 'okay' to 'good,' the bread lacerated our hard palates.  Do the math..food not worth the 3 hours wait time. Never again... this place turns me off and an entire evening gone,,, over-rated, game over."}
{"text":"We are out-of-towners (from Michigan) and in Cleveland for a sports trip. We heard about this place either from TV or somewhere else, so we made it a point to try it out. We didn't realize the drive it took from downtown Cleveland to the restaurant. There was parking behind the restaurant in a small downtown area.   The decorations are trippy and just crap all thrown together - eclectic you may say, but always something to look at inside. The bathrooms were a bit dark, but otherwise did the job.   We got sat at the bar because otherwise the wait was going to be too long for our stomachs. Thankfully, we came in on a full stomach, especially important for the portions here.   Our waitress/bartender was friendly and helpful. However, we were right next to the server's area/kitchen door and we must have gone where there was a group leaving and going. Lots of bitching going on and talking crap within the servers to other servers. I get venting at work, but doing it right next to customers wasn't too cool in my book. My dirty looks I guess weren't cutting it for them to catch a hint to complain elsewhere.   I got the Chicken and Waffles sandwich with fries, while my husband got the Monte Cristo. Sandwiches are huge and we both got whole orders thinking we would take them to our hotel for a late night snack and boy did we!   Both sandwiches were flavorful and delicious. Good blend of sweet, savory, and spicy with the Chicken and Waffle sandwich. The Monte Cristo was crunchy and sweet all at the same time. The fries as well were good, but the sandwiches are the main show.   Wish Melt Bar & Grilled was in Michigan, but next time in Cleveland we will go back and try something else! Definitely a place to glutton out and have no shame with stuffing your face or worrying about calories."}
{"text":"I've always said cheese makes everything better! This place nailed it! Super friendly staff, VERY clean, bright, fun decor for your eyes entertainment,  great place to bring the family. I came here with a business partner and was blown away by the menu. Who knew you could make a grilled cheese so many different ways! We sat at the bar and the girl working had the best attitude!  She was funny, upbeat, fast and kept a smile on our faces. I don't think it matters what u order here because everything looks amazing. You get more than enough on your plate for the price. I would maybe suggest sharing if you don't have a big appetite. I will definitely be returning.  Don't forget to eat it quick though while your cheese is still hot!"}
{"text":"Cool place, awesome menu names, overall a nice place for the young crowd.    Expect to wait for a good amount of time before being seated.  I went on a Thursday night and thought it wouldn't be too bad, but even then it was about a 20 min wait, so I can't imagine Fri/weekends.  They give you a sticker with a random name, not your own (ours was \"dumbo\"), and they come find you when your table's ready.  Cute concept, but I wonder how reliable the system is when the restaurant gets really crowded.     The waitress was super friendly (or I was just in a good mood).  She explained the food, their sandwich concept, and commented on our orders just to the point of seeming very amicable without being overly involved/intrusive - quite hard to do.    I thought this was just going to be a cheese sandwich joint with a twist.  Well, it's a pretty nice twist.  Personally, I'm not a huge cheese fan, so I was semi-apprehensive, but there are a lot of menu options, many of which the cheese doesn't take center stage or doesn't seem overpowering.   The sandwiches overall are very dense, oily, and...good.  The side of fries were decent.  But I state again, VERY dense and oily.  You come here on a Monday and you'll be juicing the rest of the week.  Also, I can normally eat a whole sandwich/burger, but this time, I had to doggy-bag 1/2 of my meal for lunch the next day (which might be a fine thing for some people).  Stuck the 1/2 sandwich into a toaster oven the next day and it was good as new and just as greasy!  So, good, hearty meal.  Just can't eat it every day or even every month."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I have to base my review on the service that I received from the front door. I didn't stay to try the food. When we arrived, all of the TVs were on the Ohio State game except two. One station was not on sports and the other was on the Arkansas/Texas A&M game. I understand the OSU TVs. I don't understand the no sports in a \"sports bar\" environment. Before we were seated, we asked if we could have one of the TVs on the Alabama (#1 team in the country) game. The receptionist informed me that they prefer to have their Cleveland teams on the TVs. I would like to know when OSU moved from Columbus to Cleveland. I'm also trying to figure out whether it is Arkansas or Texas A&M that moved to Cleveland. Oh...the non-sports channel....hmmmmm....she got me on that one. We turned around and walked out. We went to Red Robin. They accommodated us with the Alabama game. Others got to watch the OSU game and they had good burgers. Hey lady....Good luck with your Cleveland teams."}
{"text":"Amazing variety of grilled cheese sandwiches, if you can still call them that. Combine grilled cheese with a full dinner at home. First time here, A+ food and service."}
{"text":"I just love melt!! I have never had a bad sandwich. It's especially fun to go with a group and share so you can have a bite of everything. It's also a great place to go if you have friends that have food restrictions, because they have something for everyone. I have a few friends that are vegan or lactose and they have cheese alternatives. Just make sure to loosen your belt before deciding to eat here! They are BIG portions!"}
{"text":"Had a blast here.  Initially we were waiting for a table and they give you a name tag and I was Flava Flav.  This cracked me up  because I met him on a shuttle at LAX many years ago and was just tellingly coworker about the story before I walked into Melt.  Karma.  Bar seats opened up so we scarfed them up to avoid the long wait.  Lucky!  I ordered the Parmageodden (sp?) as I am half Polish and you don't get many pierogies in the DC area.  It was soooo good.  Oh and I had them add jalapeños for an extra kick.  I watched the Guy Fieri piece on Melt before I went and it was great.  Can't remember what my dining buddy had but she loved it!"}
{"text":"Ok this goes beyond comfort food.  This is wear stretchy pants and have Lipitor handy. Omg grilled cheese heaven"}
{"text":"The only downside is that they don't take reservations and the wait is usually 1 hour or longer. NOW  TO THE GOOD STUFF!!!!  Hubby and I decided to try MELT for our anniversary, after hearing nothing but great things about it.  Hubby had, \"The Dude Abides\" and I had \"Chorizo & Potato\" and added a fried egg and avacado per the waiter's advice.  Hey, if I cared about calories, I wouldn't have come here.  The sandwhiches are so big that we only had 1/2 of a 1/2 and the slaw is to die for.  The fresh french fries were SOOOOOO good too!  Not too much salt and had a wonderful crunch on the outside with soft potato on the inside.  It could not have been better!  For dessert we tried the fried twinkies and were rewarded with a wonderfully fried twinkie with a raspberry sauce.  It melted in my mouth.  IT WAS FABULOUS!!!!!   The parking was less than desirable, but the service was wonderful.  We always had something cool to drink and napkins to wipe our hands with.  We never felt neglected even in the busy place!  I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what I could say that hasn't been said already.  This is my 2nd time to a MELT, but my first time at this one.  It's smaller than the one in Cleveland Hts, but more space to move around it.  The staff here was super friendly and very helpful.  It was the first time hubby and I brought our kids and NO they don't have a kids menu, but to help out, they had a ton of \"small\" suggestions.  We decided to get the \"Kindergarten\" meal and split it between our boys.  THEY LOVED IT!!  Basic grilled cheese and fries.  They were in heaven!"}
{"text":"The wait time is about a half hour during dinner time.  At least the wait name tags were humorous. The portions were gigantic.  and was cooked to order."}
{"text":"Their food quality has changed within the past two years. Do not get the kindergarten combo with tomato soup. The grilled cheese sandwich hardly has any cheese and is mainly 2 extra thick slices of bread. The tomato soup is a bigger disappointment. It was extra heavy and seemed like it was just a can of tomato paste dumped into a cup."}
{"text":"it's got the perfect amount of kitsch! Not going to lie - you tell me I'm waiting an hour and spending $13 on grilled cheese, I'm gonna say \"you're crazy,\" but being that I jump on the trend train and if I saw it on the Food Network and it's known throughout all of Cleveland (let's face it, there isn't a ton to talk about there, really), then of course I'll have to make my way there.  So yes, there was a 60 minute wait on a weekday afternoon. Parking was easy. The wait wasn't a true hour, but there was enough to look at and take in to make the time go fast. Not to mention, I appreciate the extensive bar so waiting once again isn't as dreaded as it might seem.   The menu is vast. There were a lot of great looking items, none that would be considered diet friendly. Hangover fries are a must. I love poutine and this is for sure a winner! I went monte cristo, I wish I hadn't. It was embarrassing how big it was. While i definitely was able to get three to four solid meals out of it, I didn't really feel good about myself after the fact. I prefer a chutney or chunkier preserve to accompany the monte cristo montrocity, but that's just me.  We also had a Cleveland cheesesteak; which was really good. I mean butter, cheese, meat, etc...how can you go wrong?! I wish they had a flight sampler because there were just too many things on the menu I wish I could have tried."}
{"text":"I would give this a 4.5 but I rounded up. The food was delicious but salty. The guy was super laid back and honestly super awesome. No issues, maybe he could of come over a little more but it was dead and he could see us from the back anyways. Regardless food was delicious and the strawberry margarita was amazing! decorations were a little tacky for the restaurant though, I do not understand those but all in all great experience would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites in Cleveland.  I am a creature of habit, so I always order the Parmageddon.  The pierogies are done well, the cheese is melted perfectly, and the homemade kraut is absolutely amazing.  The flavors all mesh well together.  They also have great fries and drinks.  The atmosphere is very cool and I love how they have the menu on the back of old vinyl record cases.  Whenever friends from out of town visit, I take them here."}
{"text":"Went here on a early Saturday evening. The wait was OVER NINETY MINUTES! The only reason we waited was because we had heard nothing but good things. Once seated, the food and the service were great. Was it worth the 90 minute wait? I don't think so, but seeing as this is the iconic place to go to in Cleveland, I think it's a place everyone should experience at least once."}
{"text":"This place is excellent once you get a seat.  The Parmageddon is awesome.  My only issues is the wait.  I would go way more often if the wait wasn't constantly 1.5 to 2 hours..   The wait keeps me away which is a shame."}
{"text":"Unique grilled cheese restaurant that offers a great selection of beer. Delicious but I must warn you come hungry! Food is heavy! There is a bit of a wait if you come at dinner."}
{"text":"The refrain heard up and down Detroit road for some two years now: a whole hour for some bread and cheese??!! blah blah blah... It's not a problem if you call ahead and get take out. The dine-in experience is just not worth the time right now. Maybe when they're not so popular i'll have a seat. We inquired about the Soul Vegetarian( greens and fried tomatoes, ick. no thanks. thought it was gonna be something better). I had the Lake Erie Monster again. Big piece of fish with jalapeno tartar sauce. Delicious does not begin to describe it. I made the mistake of chomping right into the decorative jalapeno that came with it. And chased it with red wine. Not that refreshing. Fries were better than usual. Fried tofu appetizer is nothing special. Slaw still tastes and looks like chopped up stuff you find in your garbage disposal.  I have some suggestions for new sammiches:   the County Commish. A fat pile of greasy bacon \"covered up\" with what probably runs through J DiMora's veins, mascarpone cheese. It's okay, I'm Italian.  the Wide Brieceiver. Big slice of HAM,brie and pepper jack so hot it forces patrons to drop it every time they touch it.  the Gambler. A slice of wonder bread and some ketchup packets. Affordably priced for Clevelanders who will lose their shirts gambling at our fantastic casino."}
{"text":"Bring an empty stomach and a love for cheese.  This place has every possible combination of sandwich that can be turned into grilled cheese.  This includes meatballs, Cuban pork, etc.  It's worth a visit when in Cleveland, but don't eat here too often or you will need to join Weight Watchers.  Especially if you get the special that gets served on a trash can lid.  I don't know how anyone could finish that in one sitting."}
{"text":"Perfect late night sandwiches with beer and cocktails to boot. You can't say no to grilled cheeses and beer. I wouldn't want live in a world without the two. The perfect combo can be found at Melts!"}
{"text":"This is grilled cheese heaven with combinations of cheese sandwiches that I've never even thought of.  While I didn't have any on my last visit the beer selection is vast and outstanding.  if I offer one warning other than being careful not to over eat it would be understand that YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT TO BE SEATED.  There aren't a lot of tables and the bar fills up quickly so walking in starving may not be the best idea."}
{"text":"When you're craving some good ole grilled cheese and homemade just won't do.   What's not to love, grilled cheese, funky menus, weird \"tacky\" 80/90s decor, and every Christmas/holiday lawn light up statue known to man!  Most weekends/evenings are pretty busy so come early and expect a wait. Staff is pretty friendly and service is \"quick\" or an quick as you can be making mass quantities of grilled cheese.   Big thing to note - they have gluten free bread and practice safe kitchen practices for those with gluten intolerances.   Best items IMHO: Fried mac n cheese - as a starter or meal! Kindergartener with tomato bisque! Smokey Russian Cuban war pig Mushroom melt  Also unless you have a large appetite/want leftovers - order a half and you'll still be stuffed."}
{"text":"One of the best places in America for a sandwich. Great value ($9-10) and super generous portions (the waitress said only 25% of the customers can ever finish their plate) you can't go wrong coming to the Melt on Cedar Rd.  Unlike other locations in this growing local chain, there is plenty of seating and waiting room up front. Also, they have a fantastic draft beer selection."}
{"text":"A cool interior - the old school ceiling 'preserved' and painted blue is kind of cool. Whether or not you are a fan of the Halloween, Christmas, AND Easter light up decorations adoring the top of the bar they do add to the character of the place. The parking situation at lunch time is bleak - it's all meters. The 6 or so free spaces reserved for Melt were all full the few times I looped around them. We were seated right away - in the window. The waiter was friendly, but the kitchen service was very slow - about 40 minutes. The portions (even the salad I ordered) were massive. It was very good though. The spinach salad with fried egg - add chicken - is my healthy recommendation at this place. Healthy is possible anywhere!"}
{"text":"Such a fun Place! Staff very helpful, and menu is not as intimidating as it appears. Great selection of beer and cocktails. Servings are huge! Kids meals have good options. The vegetarian in our group was delighted with the many options, and raved over the buffalo style sandwhich with tofu."}
{"text":"I have been to this location of Melt four times now, including my visit last night. Their pierogie appetizer is two perfect pierogies that are better than any I have ever had. Their sandwiches are great and their fries are acceptable. My advice is to always try their special feature sandwich; they never disappoint.   However, on last nights visit, our appetizer was almost burnt and my sandwich wasn't prepared as requested. As always, their service was great and they worked hard to help me. I will say I like the Cleveland Heights location a bit better, but this was just one negative experience compared to three positive times."}
{"text":"A few months ago me and my parents had decided that we wanted to try a new place to eat out. We had previously noticed that this Melt was normally not to crowded. When we arrived we were seated right away and our order was taken, the service seemed a bit slow for a place with so many servers and when our food did arrive it was good but not worth the prices they charge. Alone this would have merited three or maybe even four stars, until I bit down on a French-fry and CRUNCH! At first I wasn't even sure what happened and continued eating until I felt around the back of my mouth with my tongue and found a rather large chunk of molar was missing. We told the restaurant manager, who was fairly kind and took down our information and told is to call corporate. I got my tooth repaired but when we tried to call corporate, no one ever answered, they have yet to contact us and for this horrendous treatment (and apparent lack of food safety standards) this Melt gets the lowest rating possible."}
{"text":"My husband and I along with our 2 kids went to melt on a Monday evening for dinner. We surprisingly had no wait and sat right down. We ordered the buffalo tofu bites, which were amazing, as an appetizer. He ordered the teenage mutant ninja turtle sandwich, which was also amazing and had the perfect amount of pesto and pizza rolls! I love the big popper and the monte cristo, so the waiter suggested combining the two!! It was amazing! I had the ham and turkey from the monte cristo with the cream cheese and jalapeños from the big popper. Normally it is a long wait for a table and for food, but our food arrived in a timely manner. We love melt and will be going again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. Prices are fairly decent and you get a lot of food. Location isn't the best because the building is on the corner where traffic is usually busy but food makes up for it. P.S bring quarters for parking!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food on planet earth. Believe the hype."}
{"text":"Why is there NOT a Melt in Baltimore?! I visited my aunt in Cleveland over the weekend and this was our dinner spot for Saturday night! WOW. We got to melt around 6-6:30 (a party of 9) and even tough we had a 30-40 min wait - the place was PACKED - we were able to entertain ourselves by first checking out the extensive beer/drink menu and grabbing a sip at the bar. After we were seated we were promptly tended to and given waters. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, the menu was almost overwhelming just with how many variations there were! Plenty of vegetarian and meat-friendly options, appetizers, salads, and desserts! I started with the 3 bean veggie chilli which came in a coffee mug and topped with sour cream & green onions - BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE because I have never had something so delicious in my entire life. Everyone at the table had a spoonful which led us to ordering another mug. My boyfriend had the soup of the day which was a delicious spicy peanut and potato that our waitress had recommended. After seeing how HUGE the sandwiches are I decided the getting the Southwest salad would be my entree, and I definitely got what I paid for! This must have been a head and a half of romaine at least, topped with shaved pepper jack cheese, red peppers, cucumbers and tortilla strips PLUS a honey chipotle drizzle. I barely made a dent in it, but I could eat that salad every day. Fresh everything, house made ranch dressing (on the side, but also super tasty) crunch veggies and chips.   The decor was awesome, they have several TV's playing a variety of different shows, and gigantic portions of amazing food!"}
{"text":"We went here on the suggestion of reading Guy Fieri's suggestion from the Food Network. We love his shows. When I first read some of the reviews we almost didn't go but I am so glad we chose to stop in. When you walk in it looks like you walked into a restaurant decorated specifically for just Halloween. I love Halloween so it didn't bother me. The only thing I'd complain about is that the wait was unnecessarily long especially when I saw open tables available. 35-40 minutes for a wait. But to be honest it was well worth it. The menus look like covers to vinyl records. Everything looks delicious and they give options for vegetarian and vegans which is nice. I got the fried green tomatoes BLT with a side of salad. I saved the other half for later. The portions are huge. So go hungry."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say or where to begin! Grilled cheese combos that are battered and deep fried or just grilled but all are melty and gooey!  I had the Big Popper. Herbed cream cheese, cheddar and jalapeños battered, fried and dusted with powdered sugar.  Served with a mixed berry jam and a mountain of French fries and slaw.  This is not your mamas grilled cheese!   Lots of beer on tap and old school decor from arcade games gone by to a huge Dairy Queen light up.  Tin ceilings.  This place is fun and a must eat when in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"If you're in Cleveland....this is sort of an institution. You HAVE to eat there once. You'll have so many mixed emotions....elation, shame, pride. You could probably get through most of the 7 deadly sins here in the best way possible.  Took my fiance here on our last night in Ohio. They have a wonderful seasonal craft beer menu which we REALLY enjoyed. He had a Southern Tier Warlock, which is one of the most delicious autumn beers (like a gingerbread cookie!) and it's practically impossible to get here in CA, let alone on tap.  The sandwich menu is huge, like the sandwiches and uber customizable. He had Cuban War Pig / honey ham, roasted pulled pork, mojo glazed pork belly, fried pickle spears, honey mustard, swiss. Before you balk at the $13 price tag, know that the sandwich is 4 inches thick. It's worth it! I opted for half a plain cheese sandwich (with bacon), buffalo chicken soup (phenomenal, craving it now!) and a salad. I could not finish it.  I guess that's why they have a challenge to eat 3lbs of cheese here! They also have vegetarian and vegan options if that's your jam.  The decor is fun, the staff had a good vibe and we really enjoyed gorging ourselves out of Ohio."}
{"text":"Yes this place is famous and has been on tv and is always packed. I don't really understand the hype though. I do like the concept however. I've had better grilled cheese sandwiches(like at Denny's -_-) and they're pretty pricey here as well. They have really unique and cool dishes. I like their falafel. I don't like their fries, and I don't like their soups. It is definitely a place to check out if in Ohio"}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago.  I came with a friend from work that has brown skin.  The service we had was so messed up I couldn't believe it.  Forget this place.  That was 4/2/14"}
{"text":"I had an amazing breaded-tofu grilled cheese sandwich w/cole slaw before hitting the road on the day after performing in Cleveland. This place is amazing. Almost every meat item on the menu has an alternate vegetarian AND vegan version. I wish more restaurants did this! If it were a little later in the day (and I didn't have to drive 2 hours), I would definitely down one of their delicious-looking draft beers! The only thing they are missing is breakfast, but that's not a big deal because everything else about this place is great. FYI, the fries are cooked in the same oil as the meat, so do with that info what you will. I substituted cole slaw. Good stuff."}
{"text":"This place is pretty neat.  I'm always a fan of vintage and bright colors, so the layout of this place really appeals to me.  This place really reminds me of a Jimmy Johns.  The food here is pretty decent, but is as \"American\" as you can get.  It's basically different versions of Grilled Cheese sandwiches, and there's nothing healthy about that.  But it's good, if you like huge portions of fries and giant sandwiches.  I don't, but I came along with a group.  I wouldn't go here again, it's not my thing.  But it's not because of the food, it's pretty good.  So I'll rate it a 3 star because it didn't look very appetizing to me (a bunch of food on a big plate), but I'm sure others may find it more appealing to the eyes."}
{"text":"First time visit. Been here an hour. Host stand quite disorganized, plenty of seating on patio as they assumed we wanted inside and didn't ask. Half hour of waiting for no reason. Our server Silena was cheery and so far has made the experience somewhat bearable. Not impressed with the food or the experience despite all the hype."}
{"text":"We arrived Monday at about 5p great parking in back (but we did have to pay) and there was no line. We were almost immediately seated (the four of us). The atmosphere is random, endless decor, however it's charming and entertaining.  I found the tall blue ceilings to open up the restaurant and make it very peaceful and artsy. They had rock music on, some songs were a bit too aggressive and I was a little annoyed lol (but one song out of however many we heard wasn't bad). We did discover some inappropriate writing on the bathroom walls though, so not sure I'd bring my child. The employees are alternatively dressed with piercings and quirky outfits, they're super inviting and helpful when inquired about drinks on their menus (which are laminated to old record covers) and very helpful to the vegetarian at the table. She was very attentive, but not overly so. Our drinks arrived quickly, and our food options were endless. Two ordered the Cleveland Cheesesteak, another ordered the Green Fried Tomato BLT (vegetarian style), and I ordered The Dude Abides (a meatball melt basically). EVERYONE LOVED their sandwich! The fries were great too, unfortunately the coleslaw was a bit spicy for me (so I took it home and added a diluted sugar mayo mix to it and it was really good) The Melt provider a very sturdy take home container for it that could probably be reused at home. Their food is reasonably priced and can easily be two meals worth (my sandwich was especially enormous, I only ate half the sandwich and was full). Overall, hubby and I were already planning another date there before we had even finished eating! We loved it! The entire time I was eating my sandwich (with a fork since it was so big I couldn't pick it up without it falling apart) I was saying \"this is so good, omg, this is so good.\" Lol I tried the cheesesteak and it was much more flavorful then I expected. However, I loved The Dude Abides much more. I loved the Italian sausage giant meatball, the sauce and the fried melty oowey gooey mozzarella cheese and the garlic bread dusted with Parmesan cheese on the outside... Dang. Sorry getting caught in the moment!! Anyways, new fave place to eat hands down! Thanks Melt for your amazing restaurant!"}
{"text":"If I've seen it on DDD, chances are that I want to try it.  The moment I heard about this restaurant all about grilled cheese I tried to think of a reason to drive all the way to Cleveland.  I finally found myself in town and stopping at Melt was at the top of my list!  Yes, there was a long wait, but that's just how it is. Some people just need a little patience.  Anyway, my mom and her friend shared the Monte Cristo and said it was delicious!  I ordered the big popper (cream cheese and jalapenos, battered and fried!) without realizing that the sandwich came in 3 sections (instead of 2, like everything else) so needless to say, I didn't finish it even though it was great.  I love that they don't use flimsy little pieces of bread for these amazing and huge sandwiches.  I almost feel like the word \"sandwich\" isn't good enough for these works of art.  I can't wait to go back, especially since I had a hard time choosing which sandwich I wanted to begin with!"}
{"text":"I saw Adam Richman do a challenge here.  Not sure if he completed it or not.  Came here while I was in town for the HOF ceremonies.  The place has a nice cool vibe.  all kinds of stuff on the walls.  Local artist displaying and selling their work.  Nice crowd and ambiance.  Food portions are large, there is a veggie menu.  Ordered the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken: breaded chicken breast, buffalo sauce, fresh blue cheese and cole slaw.  Also on the plate is fresh green salad and more cole slaw.  Everything was good.  I was not able to finish the food, had to take it on the plane with me..  Service was great.  Waiter was cool and funny.  Would recommend"}
{"text":"As a frequent traveler I am always reluctant to just have just any old meal if I can prevent it. I'm looking for the top of the line or either something I can go back and tell my girlfriend about via snapchat. Now let's just say there was a snap involved here but nothing that I was just blown away by. Didn't even make it to \"My Story\".   I started with the Fried Mozz which was simply ordinary. I love fried cheese sticks of any variety and was not impressed--I should have tried the fried tofu instead. I decided to go with the BBQ Pig Burger, which again was \"any old meal\", simply a burger with what seemed like microwaved pulled pork. WAY TOO MUCH BREAD! I'd rather my burger reign over my bun, not the other way around.   On a brighter note--service was great, as I am from Austin and made me feel like I'm back home in a nice hippy, Freebird-ish atmosphere. As bad as this review sounds, the food was good and will probably come back I'd just stay away from the normal items. I hear the Monte Carlo is pretty good, but read a review about the serving of meat you actually have on your melt, order with caution!  Yours Truly"}
{"text":"For starters, the food was great.  However, our experience was soured due to the bad service.  We always visit Melt, when we visit family in Cleveland.  So, you could imagine our disappointment when we were told our wait was only going to be thirty minutes, when it was actually an hour.  There was evidently a staffing issue, as the front of the house manager had to clear tables.  We noticed several tables available, so we questioned the wait.  Why couldn't we sit at one of those?"}
{"text":"So, turns out checking into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on FB proves to be really beneficial at times- a couple of coworkers who are from the Cleveland area immediately texted me and said, \"You have to go to Melt! afterwards!\" This place serves some of the biggest grilled cheese sandwiches I've seen- not to mention some really good flavors combinations! I got their chorizo and diced potato option-thick pieces of perfectly grilled bread held together a really delicious combo of chorizo, diced potato, and cheddar. My mom, who is a big salad fan, ordered their fried chicken salad which comes with a really awesome Sriracha/ranch dressing- she was able to get the fried chicken swapped for non breaded, shredded chicken without a bat of our servers eye. On top of this, our service was fast! And friendly! I don't think we waited more than 15 minutes from the time we ordered to when our food came out. Melt also does a mean take out business- I saw numerous cars pull up and people running out with bags of food during my meal.   Now, Melt also wins some points for being fully veg/vegan friendly- all of their sandwich options which can be made as such are listed on their menus. I am not vegan (hence my love affair with chorizo), but it was nice to see this as an option while staying in Erie."}
{"text":"First time here. Food, drinks and service were all great. They handled a large party and were very attentive."}
{"text":"Every location has pretty much the same quality. Large portions and many unique options. It is also very vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free friendly. Sometimes there can be a long wait, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Every location has pretty much the same quality. Large portions and many unique options. It is also very vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free friendly. Sometimes there can be a long wait, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"All the positive reviews of the food are true.....I've tried a lot of the menu and have seriously liked every sandwich I've gotten (The Lake Erie Monster, Municipal Stadium Magic, Smoky Russian, BBQ Chicken, The Dude Abides....).  Admittedly, I haven't had any starters or desserts because the sammies are so huge.  They've got a great bar with a good beer selections.  Service is good.  There are long waits sometimes.....but they're usually what you would think would be the busiest times (Weekends/Weekend Nights)."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here because we were starving, and it was one of the few vegan friendly restaurants in the neighborhood. I had a vegan grilled cheese with sausage and potatoes, and he had soup and salad (he's not vegan). My sandwich was so good that I had to ask if they sent the correct one out. My husband loved his tomato soup and his salad. The fries were just ok, but I was so impressed by the sandwich, that it didn't matter. The service was not spectacular, but it was good enough. If we're back in Cleveland, we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service. The peanut butter banana sandwich was glorious. Not sure I'll be back in the area anytime soon, but if I ever am, this place will be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Quick service. Unique combos on the sandwiches.... Owner has a lot of thought in this place and it shows."}
{"text":"This local spot in downtown is a staple, it definitely does not lack in character. From the moment you walk in, there are curiosities from floor to ceiling and everything in between.  If you're coming with a friend, you can share a sandwich because the portions are enormous. We had the Parma Italy and it was delicious- with its Texas toast, juicy chicken, melted mozarella and marinera- everything was on point, except the service, the waitress lacked attention to detail and seemed like she'd rather be somewhere else.  Definitely a great spot to check out in Cleveland with a great beer selection. Cheers."}
{"text":"Great place! Fun atmosphere, lively crowd and interesting menu. We just stopped in for drinks and apps. They've got a great tap list. We had the pierogis and buffalo tofu. Both were outstanding. I would have loved to try one of their sandwiches but we had other plans. I'll have to make sure I get back there."}
{"text":"In a perfect world every place would live up to the hype.  I have experienced a glimmer of the perfect world here.  Maybe it has to do with a little cheese too...  Melt absolutely lives up to the hype.  From the funky atmosphere, to the ultra friendly and laid back vibe to the delicious melty sandwiches, I'm a fan!  Going in I expected at least a 2 hour wait, as I had heard is the standard.  Thankfully it was only 30 minutes long, which wasn't bad at all compared to 2 hours.  We went on a Saturday at 1pm too, but I think maybe the ungodly hot weather just kept everyone at home in front of their air conditioning.  Doesn't matter because we won that day!    I was immediately blow away by their MASSIVE beer list.  Holy crap.  I really don't know if I've seen so many beers.  I love draft beer and they even had about 30 beers on draft, which is awesome.  I choose the Southern Tier Creme Brulee which tastes as good as it sounds.  A dark beer with a sweet aftertaste.  Delish!    I picked the Mushroom Melt because I can't help but pick a portabella mushroom off the menu!  The sandwich was huge, with thick slices of Italian bread, piled thick with marinated porto mushrooms and the most tasty provolone cheese I've ever had.  And... it was melted.  The mountain of fries just topped off the whole meal, since it equally matched the amazing sandwich in quality.  The slaw was the forgotten child, as it was just okay and slightly marinated with vinegar.  But seriously, who cares about that when you have a plateful of other deliciousness?!    I'd say Cleveland's got a winner with Melt, but they already know that!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the wait. And wait you will. About an hour and a half generally, unless you go on off times. Don't despair though- there's beer! And if Melt is packed, you can find a bar close by and wait it out. I have the most impatient hubby when it comes to lines and even he agrees it was worth it. Now then, to the food.  I got the Porky Cheese- swiss, ham, crispy bacon, and added on two fried eggs. It came on delicious Texas toast and was surprisingly not messy! The fries (OMG- THE FRIES) are so f'ing good. My cuz suggested we skip the coleslaw and get extra fries and I totally see his reasoning behind it, even though I opted for keeping the slaw (it was good and I like to get a veggie in there somewhere!). I was only able to eat half of mine, but in all honesty, if there hadn't been any witnesses, I might have tried to eat the whole damn thing.  Some other sandwiches I witnessed being shoveled in to loved ones' mouths...Westside Monte Cristo (looked amazing!), Summer Chicken (my cuz loves this one), Flying Falafel Melt (the special of the month), and The Godfather (lasagna style!).   All in all- a great place. I even bought a t-shirt and joined the Melt Army!  Special Note: They have a patio!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite burger joint. The portion sizes are massive, and I LOVE the way the toast for the bun is prepared. I explicitly build my own burger. Their fries aren't anything special, but they're good.   Their craft beer selection is spot on. Nothing goes better with a good burger like a good IPA (in my humble opinion).   I have but two gripes with this restaurant: 1) The wait for food is a little longer than it should be. 2) The wait to be seating is longer than it should be.   Both of these are intentional. The idea is to always make new customers wait to create a sense of \"this place is so hip, it's always busy.\"  I find that rather disturbing, but it's working because that place is always slammed."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience here. My turkey sandwich had some bad flavors going on, and our waiter was snarky. Sorry, Melt fans, but it's just not the place for me."}
{"text":"The gluten free kimchi sandwich was awesome! They don't have a designated fryer for French fries though so you can't have any of sides except a salad (which you have to pay extra for). But it was fantastic"}
{"text":"Been here twice, I stop in any time I'm in the area. Great food, a nice selection of beers, and very attentive service. Be sure to come in with an appetite! Every grilled cheese combination you could ask for, but there are also options for those who don't want a grilled cheese sandwich. Highly recommend this place! Also, try the Heavy Seas Tropicannon draft. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Decided at the end of the day even if its the best of its kind I can't give a sandwich place 5 stars.  But for all intensive purposes consider it as such."}
{"text":"Yes, the food is big tasty and messy and the beers are plenty. Yes, I ate like a pig. Yes, I fell in love (lust) with a punker girl half my age who works there.   it wasn't busy when I was there at 5pm on a Thursday and i shot the shit with many of the workers there, who were all sweet as the raspberry sauce that came with my Big Popper sandwich.   `Nuff said suckahs! if you are near this place forgo the local Whole Foods and Panera and come get some!"}
{"text":"OMG. The food was fantastic... but I might die from a heart attack later.  I got the Cleveland Cheese Steak, and let me tell you, it puts all Philly Cheese Steaks to shame.  I would eat this over any philly cheese steak... if you can promise that I won't die of clogged arteries with the next meal.  I love that their kitchen is open late, so I can get a great meal after a long day of work.  A half a sandwich is more than enough for me, so it also gives me lunch for the next day.  My sandwich made me drool even after microwaving it for lunch the next day.  But I do think I must have taken 500% of calories and fat for the 2 days, and I probably took a year off my life.  Might still be worth it... just not too often.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"I just went to this place a few days ago while on tour with my band. The place came highly recommended by a guy in another band and I was a little scepticle at first, because it's a place the pretty much only sells grilled cheese.... And I'm vegan!   I googled it a little before going to see what was up and it looked pretty real, as far as vegan options go, so we checked it out.   The wait for a table was very long and so was the wait for take out, but it was a little shorter, so we just did that. As it was it only took like ten min.  So my girl friend and I got the mushroom some thing or other with the vegan cheese... And then we also got the kindergartner with vegan cheese and adde the baked tofu to it, then we split them so we each got half of the other. Both were totally amazing!! They use like Texas toast or some thing, for the bread, and it's really good.  I highly recommend this place if you're in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"If you're dieting, don't go to Melt.  If you don't give a damn, go to Melt.  You only live once.  Go to Melt!"}
{"text":"We love Melt Bar & Grill! You will need to expect a wait bc of its popularity. Our favorite is the melt sandwhich with a pierogi on it!"}
{"text":"The Melt has a lot of hype but that is a blessing and a curse for them. Sure they have a lot of business (which I guess is the main goal) but the food is just alright. And that is the curse, they have this high-level bar to always hit. This was our first time to the Melt and instead of being blown away I regret not going to the Red Robin at the other end of the shopping center. The staff was friendly and attentive but the food was overpriced 'eh.' Our Melt Pierogi was burnt and I don't know anyone who wants a plate of the hard white base of a cabbage. My Chorizo and Potato sandwich was surprisingly lacking in taste and spice. So really I had plain meat and potatoes with cheese...for $9.  The fries are good and it is cool they load the plate up with them. Also, the atmosphere is great, the eclectic styles mix great (minus the holiday plastic lawn ornaments, that kills the great looking bar IMO). All in all, the food was not horrible and the environment is interesting. I just cannot understand the hype and doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"I will make the 3 hr drive back to Cleveland just to go back to this place!  I knew we were going to love it as soon as we walked in the door...old school plastic Christmas, Halloween, and Easter decorations all over the place.  While we were waiting for the host some guest left and the host said \"Have a good day...and good luck pooping!\" and \"...Rome was not built in a Dagobah System.\" Heck yes, this is the place for me!  We wait about 30 min for a table for 4 on a Saturday afternoon, but since this place is all over Food Network and Travel Channel...thats not bad!  Plus it is a small place so we were fine with the wait.  The beer list is AmAzInG!!  There are more beer options than food! :-)  The beer menu is 4 pages, all organized by type and a list of recommended beers.  Food...oh sweet Jesus the food!!  I went with out waiters recommendation and had The Big Popper. Cheese, fresh jalapenos, and herbed cream cheese slathered over to pieces of thick bread...and deep fried!  It combined the two things this fat kid loves the most...jalapeno poppers and bread....and deep fried it!  Then it was served with a mixed berry dip!  Crunchy, sweet, spicy, cheesy and ooey gooey smooth cream cheese!  I haven't even gotten to the hand cut fries....SO GOOD!  And spicy slaw!  I felt like a pig and the plate...better yet platter, didn't even look like someone had ate anything! At $10.50 I had 3 meals off of it...how's that for value?!  The Hubs had The Parmageddon. Perogis and kraut with grilled onion and cheese.  He loved every bite of it, and like me, he was able to get another meal out of it because there is so much food!  My sister-in-law had the Monte Cristo, which was also very good.  It was a typical Monte Cristo, and still very gooey and delish!    My brother-in-law had The Dudes Abides and he LOVED it!  His had TONS of cheese...plus cheese sticks!  And huge meatballs!    The portions are huge, I strongly recommend sharing a sandwich with someone if you can!  The atmosphere is nice, service is down to earth and very nice.    I like that this place is itself.  If you are not a hipster you wont feel out of place...it is a place for everyone to EAT, drink, and be very merry....and a bit blocked up from cheese."}
{"text":"Melt is obviously awesome, so I'm reviewing the bartender...  Vinny is not only the best bartender ever, he is by far the employee of the century. He basically runs the place, serving every single seat at the Melt bar as soon as they arrive, making super informed recommendations, slinging beers, crafting cocktails, memorizing food orders, helping the servers... He's on top of EVERYTHING. We love to sit at the bar and just watch him work. It's kind of amazing how much he's able to handle. All the while being an awesome dude and great fun behind the bar."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Melt. I really wish you sucked and had terrible food so I wouldn't have to wait to get in.  I'm always annoyed that restaurants with fantastic food have a waiting list. Just think of this.... if Lola and the Greenhouse and Crop had lousy food and service we could probably walk in and get a seat anytime of the day or night!  That would be so cool.  I was stuck downtown for a few hours between work and a late meeting so I went to Melt hoping to score a seat at the bar.  I had to wait about 30 minutes, but I eventually grabbed a seat. The wait was made more tolerable by the Belle's two hearted ale I ordered. There is a lot that can be fixed with a great beer list and Melt has one of the best.  Which also sucks because if all they served was Schlitz and Pabst I could probably get a seat at the bar more easily.  One can only dream.  I ordered the Monte Cristo. My God what a sandwich!. Cheesy meaty, toasted beautifulness.  Although I wish they didn't add cheese because you know how cheese gets a little greasy when it's melted. If they didn't use cheese then I wouldn't have to use my napkin so much. So it would be great if they didn't use cheese anymore.  Hopefully they will read this review and keep that in mind for the future.  Aside from the food and the beer I just love the little touches. The menus are so cool and the decor is perfect for the hip eclectic place that it is.  I'm not sure if they do this already, but perhaps they could set up a system where you give them your cell number and they can call you when you reach the top of the waiting list.  It's in a pretty interesting neighborhood and this way you won't be all jammed in with everyone else crammed in against you. You can wander around or get coffee while you are waiting.  Other than that I love everything about this place."}
{"text":"Yum! I've been here a few times since moving to Cleveland and this place (food-wise) doesn't disappoint! Every grilled cheese i've had here has been delicious and I try to take out of town visitors to this very coveted sandwich shop. I've had the chorizo and potato, smokey russian, and purple parma (tip: add chorizo to make it even better) and I can't pick a favorite. Also, try the desserts, the bread pudding is humble but delicious.  The only reason why it's 4 and not 5 stars is because the wait is extraordinarily long. I've hit 3-4 hour wait times on weekends and evenings. The wait time for carry out is not much better. Come prepared and bring something to keep you entertained because I guarantee at least an hour waiting time and you have to be there to get your name on the waiting list, no call ahead."}
{"text":"I came to town for a festival and some locals took me to Melt. I went everyday I was in town (not the same location) I had the vegetarian Wake & Bacon and the Mushroom Melt twice!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Be prepared to wait a looooonnnnggg time to get a table unless you visit at random times.  By following them on Twitter @MeltBarGrilled you can find out when they have a shorter wait.  When I really want a Monte Cristo (the preserves it's served with are to die for) but I don't have at least an hour to wait for a table, I call in an order to go.  It's your whole week's worth of calories in one meal."}
{"text":"This place is fun and different, but the food is nothing to write home about. For one thing, I don't even think the sandwiches they server are technically grilled cheese sandwiches??  It's thick slices of Texas toast (which are delicious) with whatever random meats/cheeses/veggies stuffed in between. It's not nearly as cheesy as a grilled cheese should be though. I'm also not a fan of the thick fries.  I tried the prime rib season special. The meat was super dry and there was barely any cheese.  My co-worker had one with mozzarella cheese sticks in it though and that one was decent. (because there was more cheese?)  Also tried the Monte Cristo which was decent. (At this point I'm thinking maybe the strategy is to just stay away from the seasonal special)  Great beer selection!  the 5lb grilled cheese challenge takes 45 minutes to prep, and when we asked her if it's \"good\", the server flat out told us it doesn't taste good, haha.  Overall a fun experience, but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Local fare establishments are always the best to visit on a vacation, and one must not miss Melt. Even at lunch hour midweek, this place is hoppin!  Waited for 30 minutes not be be disappointed! The absolute BEST Monte Cristro sandwich!  Even better than that ol' Bennigan's one from times past.  The berry disposing sauce is to die for! The bacon they use is superb.  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing! The only thing keeping a 5 star rating is the noise level.  You need to shout to the person next to you in order to have a conversation.  Not very cool! Overall, a must to visit again, and again, and again.... Here is a hope-expansion across the country!"}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Portions are large, so large it appears everyone takes some home. Very busy even at 2pm on a Thursday. Serve was blah."}
{"text":"Coming from a true cheese fanatic, Melt was only created out of the deepest food fantasies of my childhood. I swear the owner and I collaborated on this! I would dream of cheese being pulled apart like an accordion atop a fresh and plump piece of bread... perfectly golden brown with a side of some Fresh Cuts... delicately balancing my bites between gooey incredible cheese and salty potatoes... well look no further, young Danielle... here sits the beauty of your visual obsession finally realized!   I am in complete awe with how fantastic these Leaning Towers of Cheese-uh look every time! I swear I get 40% of my enjoyment from my chin-dropping stalking of the plates while they leave the kitchen. While I, myself, stick to a more pure selection, the laden down with meats and toppings sandwiches amaze me all the same!   There is not much more anyone can say in a review to convince you to try this fine establishment. You 100% HAVE to give it a chance yourself to ever truly know the unbe-cheese-able experience your taste buds will adventure upon! Support local! Say cheese, please!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Had the Cleveland cheesesteak and couldn't  have asked for a more delicious meal. Terrific service and well worth the drive from Pittsburgh to enjoy it. Guy And Adam from the Travel Channel didn't exaggerate at all on this place. Absolutely wonderful. Too bad I didn't have room for the fried Twinkie!"}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and turned to Yelp to find a dinner place. This fit the bill perfectly. The menu is huge and every plate that went by our table looked amazing, in addition to big portions. We split the friend green tomatoes and the Caribbean Jerk War Pig melt and we were stuffed! Great craft beers and our waitress, Sam Smith was a huge help. The place filled up fast and we see why! Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Stopped here one of our most recent road trips - spreading the word about locally-owned businesses. Though it was only a Tuesday they had a heavy lunch rush. Regardless, we sat immediately. Our co-founder ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT (fried green tomatoes, seared pork belly, southern herb remoulade, romaine lettuce, cheddar). Our server was excellent and seemed to know menu items well and what the customer favorites are. If you haven't seen them on Man vs. Food, be prepared because portions are huge. If we're ever back in the CLE area we will stop back in, because locally-owned restaurants return two times more money to the local economy than national chains."}
{"text":"I love Melt. Every time I am near one it's not up for negotiation, that's where we go. I just went with a friend to a concert in Cleveland so we had to stop. We pulled in around 2:00 on a Saturday and they were busy but out of control, we waited about 10 minutes or so for a table.  Since we were going to a concert and not to hibernate I went with the simple Kindergarten sandwich with sharp cheddar and a cup of tomato soup.  The food is just so comforting and delicious. Service is always on point and food is always amazing."}
{"text":"Please come to Chicago!!! Our first (and hopefully not last) visit to Melt was definitely memorable. The atmosphere was cool and relaxed. The menu is huge and has unlimited choices. I ordered the Big Popper, which was amazing. My wife, the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken Melt, which I was more than happy to help her finish (It was awesome). The fries and slaw definitely completed our melt-tastic meal.  Not to mention the beer menu was worthy of an extended stay. Nothing better than grilled cheese sandwiches, micro-brews, and MLB on TV. Only question is where I'm getting MY Melt tattoo!!!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure at this place. Customer service is good and I'm happy that they have vegan options! Please try the vegan food burger'"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant from my girlfriends Aunt and boy o boy did she deliver. OMG the food is out of this world and the sandwiches are ginormous.  I could barely finish my meal because of the amount of food you get, and I got a cup of soup.  I can't wait til the next time I visit Cleveland again so I can visit this place for more menu items. Lol. 5 Stars here"}
{"text":"Huge portions!  We had a great waiter who helped explain the entire menu and offered suggestions!  Food was fresh and very good! I had the BbQ chicken with a salad instead of fries which I enjoyed very much!  Homemade blue cheese dressing was a bonus!"}
{"text":"Lorrrrrd hammmercy! Cleveland knows what's up when it comes to amazing foods.  The good:  There are so many melt options! All of your food fantasies can and will come true here. Ever wanted a meat loaf grilled cheese? DONE! Ever wanted a philly cheese steak sub as a melt that'll probably clog your arteries? DONE! Are you thinking \"oh no, I'm a vegetarian I guess I'll just eat a bunch of appetizers...\" not to worry, bless yourself with a cheese, mushroom spinach melt.  Service here is A++++. So if you have a screaming toddler like we did, don't even worry. A magical waiter will come to your rescue with a bowl of gold fish crackers.   The bad:  It's a tad pricey for a family (but worth every penny) There's a risk of you falling into a deep food coma"}
{"text":"Food outstanding.  Great menu.  Music irritatingly loud.  Unbelievable cheesesteak sandwich and fries!  Server went to great lengths to make sure we were happy."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite restaurants in the US.  I crave this place when I'm back in Boston. I even go as far as to look at the menu online to see what's new.   I got a huge plate of food and french fries. I, like someone who hasn't eaten for days devoured every last bite with sheer joy.   The only complaint I have for Melt is that the wait stinks. We waited for 2 hours for a seat. However, patience is a virtue and I still have mine intact especially when the reward is artisan bread, delicious cheese with all the fixings! Not to mention the beer isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Melt Bar & Grilled is one of my new fave places to dine in NE Ohio. The atmosphere and decor are pretty wild. They have Christmas and Halloween decorations everywhere. It's weird but kinda cool too!  First things first though, if you're looking for a quiet place to dine- this isn't it. We went on a Thursday night and found that this joint was packed, bustling, and LOUD with a capital \"L\". Probably the loudest place I have ever dined.   I didn't mind it so much though, because the service was good and the menu and food were awesome.   I really love the concept of this being a \"Grilled Cheese\" restaurant. They have everything from traditional grilled cheese, to chicken & waffle grilled cheese, to pierogi grilled cheese, to cheesesteak grilled cheese...I mean, the options are endless!  I ordered the lasagna grilled cheese which is called \"The Godfather\". OMG! It.Was.Bomb! Basically it's a hunk of lasagna smashed between two pieces of scrumptious, buttery, grilled bread! So gooood!  I also ordered the Awesome Noodle #1 salad which comes with greens, lo mein noodles, avocado, tomato, mint, cilantro, candied peanuts and a few other yummy ingredients. I added crispy tofu as well. It was DELICIOUS! Seriously one of the best salads I've ever had.   I absolutely LOVE this place and it will definitely be among my regular hot spots when I go back to Ohio to visit family!"}
{"text":"Winner winner, chicken dinner! That's the name of the sandwich I had tonight. It was very tasty. Have you ever had sweet corn puree and scalloped potatoes on a sandwich before? Well, now's your time to give it a try. Bartenders are very attentive and helpful.  The beer selection is extensive. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the prices are a little steep. I remember the days of going to Melt in Lakewood and the food was good and CHEAP. Now, the food is good and moderately priced."}
{"text":"Adult grilled cheese?  Novel concept.  The food was good (not great).  The wait was long - prepare for a long wait, this place is always packed!  The bread is quite greasy, but the innards were excellent, along with gigantic portions."}
{"text":"really enjoyed my peanut butter and banana sandwich with cole slaw. Prices are reasonable and you are able to get the half sandwich which is plenty. I believe that they make their own peanut butter which is flavorful. Service is always very good and this location was expanded about a year ago so I had no wait. They have specials each month and their vegetable sides are always unique and tasty. Matt Fish has a hit with this concept and it is run very professionally."}
{"text":"I've been to this place since they opened up in Cleveland heights, and yes it's great but after going here for 5+ times you will get bored of it.  Their menu changes a lot since they first opened which I'm not the biggest fan of. For example, they gotten rid of giving their coleslaw with every sandwich. They got rid of some of sandwiches that I really liked (can't remember their names)  I would recommend this place if you want a unique grill cheese, a cool atmosphere, and a nice desert/drink special. I will only come back if my friends really wants to go."}
{"text":"Melt has the best sandwiches around. The Monte Cristo is highly recommended, however you can't go wrong with any of the other choices on the menu. Melt also has a variety of unique flavored Root Beers on their menu. The wait can be hours long however so do not go on a tight schedule (and they don't take reservations). If you are short on time, calling for takeout might be a better option."}
{"text":"I went at noon on a Monday and was seated immediately. The server did a great job of explaining menu options and the food was prompt.   The sandwiches were very good, but the amount of it is entirely too much to consume. Giant sandwich + fries + slaw is delicious but I hit the wall halfway through.   I'll go back when I return to Cleveland"}
{"text":"Melt bar and grilled is the suture that pulls the skin of the hipster community together in Cleveland.  Food is always excellent, draft beer selection is both huge and affordable, service is good, and the interior is a pleasure to look at.   The fried sandwiches, both the Monte Cristo and the big popper, are certainly the greasy stars of Melt, I would suggest out of towners try these. However, their menu has many excellent options.   Buffalo fried tofu salad?  Plain grilled cheese kindergartner?  Melt burgers?  All excellent choices.  Be sure to enjoy with beer.  Not all is rainbows and butterflies however.  The wait at the melt can sometimes be atrocious, food can be greasy / heavy, and beards are quite large among the staff (possible pro or con, ahaha)."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place when you are in town you need to check out- especially if you love grilled cheese and comfort food.  I used to go to the original Melt, so I was very excited to try a different location.  The Independence location is cool and definitely has a lot to look at and check out, but the atmosphere is not as great as the original.  There is still a lot on the walls, things hanging from the ceiling, and an awesome menu that comes on an old record to view.  Because we were out for lunch, the three of us all ordered the half sandwich, which is more than enough to get you full. We ordered the Wake & Bacon, Chorizo & Potato, and the Summer Chicken.  The Wake & Bacon and the Summer Chicken were fantastic.  The sauce on the Summer Chicken really makes the sandwich stand out.  I was not a huge fan of the Chorizo & Potato.  Our server was awesome, which always adds to a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is not for me. I like my grilled cheese sandwiches simple."}
{"text":"When our friends heard we were headed to Cleveland, they all said \"You MUST visit Melt!!!\".  We were meeting friends in the area for dinner, and decided to, indeed, give it a try.  I had very high hopes, but our experience was, all in all, pretty dismal.  There was a 30 minute wait for a table, which I understood, as it was 6PM.  But, it was a Tuesday..so I thought if there was that kind of a wait on a TUESDAY, it must be fantastic!  When our names were called, we were led through a dining room that was at least 1/2 empty.  I'm not really sure what was going on...servers were EVERYWHERE, but SO many empty tables.  I'm not quite sure why we had to wait 30 minutes when the restaurant was half empty and there appeared to be more than enough staff, but I'm not in the restaurant business.  Still...it just seemed....odd.  I chose an appetizer, which I seldom do, because I'd never  had perogies.  I found them bland and tasteless, and rather soft and mushy.  Neither the taste nor the texture was especially pleasing.  For my sandwich, I chose 1/2 a BBQ sandwich, and it was..below average.  The fries WERE outstanding, though.  All in all, I found it an overpriced, mediocre, at best, experience.  I don't anticipate returning."}
{"text":"Its a roll of the dice! Sometimes food is ok and sometimes cold and not good. I think since they have opened more stores they have slipped."}
{"text":"I never order anything there and really enjoyed it. The wings are good and I love the beer!"}
{"text":"Very Good  While visiting Cleveland with the hubby, son and daughter-in-law, we decided to check out DDD recommendation for Melt... we were not disappointed.  Huge portions of very nicely cooked food.  Nice downtown ambience with friendly service.  We had the Fried Green Tomatoes, which was delicious.  We also had the Eggplant Parm (forgot what they call it) and it was cooked perfectly.  There fried mozzarella and meatballs was to die for and the meatloaf, delish!  The fries unfortunately, I must say, were pretty awful, but thankfully with the huge portions of main entrée, it didn't matter much.  The only negative is that service was pretty slow and the food only cam out warm, not hot... which to me is a BIG MISSTEP.  We sat outdoors which was very cool.  Well worth the trip to Lakewood from downtown Cleveland.  Another right on the money tip from Guy Fieri."}
{"text":"First off, quite pricey for what you get. The fries were not good and the pickle was wilted. As for the sandwich, I had a mushroom sandwich, but I don't remember the name. The juices soaked the bread, making the sandwich fall apart. It was fine, but nothing that much better than you average bar food. Overall, I was quite unimpressed."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and addicting. The service is slow but nice and worth the wait. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor. TONS of beers on tap and bottled. Huge menu of food. Huge portions also. Monte Crisco was awesome. Friendly people. Huge Bar w/ tons of TVs for watching the game. Def would come back if in the area. Def worth the drive for out of towners."}
{"text":"Firecracker Chicken was super delicious if you like spicy food. The pineapple really seals the deal to balance the spicy part. A bit of a food comma now but so worth it as a once a trip event."}
{"text":"Food here is absolutely delicious.  I've tried the Lake Erie Monster, Dude Abides, Wake n Bacon, a burger, the fries, the chocolate chai bread pudding, the strawberry bread pudding, the fried pierogi...always beyond awesome.  However...make sure that you are not in any sort of rush when you go here.  Not only will the wait range from 0 mins to an hr, but on occasion I've had waitstaff that were UNBELIEVABLY slow.  On my last visit we waited 10 mins to give our drink orders and had to ask the waiter to take our food order, the food itself took a little long considering there are only about 20 tables in the whole place and only 1/3 were full.  The food was good, but...the waiter only came back once--one friend never had his drink refilled and then we sat there for 15 min trying to get the waiter's attention to get the bill and boxes.  I had to call over another waitress to bring him out from the back, and when she did, we waited from 6:30 to 7:10 for him to come back.  Eventually I had to go up TO THE BAR to ask someone to let me pay and they said \"only\" our waiter could ring us out, so I had to stand by the kitchen door...pathetic...to personally grab him and hand him my credit card.  In the time we stood at the bar waiting to pay, they'd cleared our table, sat a new group, and had brought out their drink orders--seriously!  It's a good thing my friends and I are decent people because we almost left without paying.  I wish I could give 5 stars, but there's no way that being treated like that by waitstaff won't sour an experience.  It would be one thing if any of the 3 employees we asked for help had actually helped us ring out, but the (apparent) policy about swiping our card ate up way too much of our evening.  You will love the food, just...make sure you have 2-3 hours to spend at Melt."}
{"text":"Much larger and more open than the original Melt (in Lakewood).  The building kind of sneaks up on you if you haven't been there before.  Food is consistent with the other restaurants."}
{"text":"Very vegan friendly.  Usually a long wait on weekends.  I have waited up to two hours.  In that time, though, I typically try to find a seat at the bar and a lot of times will just eat there.  It's a really good place to go to just hang out if you have nowhere else to be.  The atmosphere is super hipstery, but typically has awesome service and staff is very informed about what they are serving you.  Very large and very awesome beer selection.  I'm not sure they even sell bud light, which is refreshing.  Their vegan cheeses are made by Daiya (I always get the mozzarella) and they have tofu as well as an incredible homemade seitan.  I typically get the \"kindergarden\", which is just bread and cheese then you pay for each topping you want.  I get a little crazy most of the time.  What I get (if it's not November or they're not serving the vegan thing with stuffing, seitan, cheese, cranberry stuff..... Thanksgiving dinner on bread):   The Kindergarden with: vegan mozzarella, avocado, seitan, caramel port onions, berry preserves, spinach and sun dried tomatoes.  It ends up being huge and crazy but SO delicious.  Get the berry preserves to dip your sandwich in.  Overall great.  Pros: Fun atmosphere, great food, great beer selection, vegan-friendly, knowledgeable staff.  Cons: Long wait, VERY high calorie food"}
{"text":"The ambiance is perfect. Great wrap-around bar. The decor is Cleveland. Cleveland Rock! The bartender was a bit overworked, but had an awesome sassy attitude that kept us laughing. Sandwiches are enormous. Cole slaw awesome."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Melt for a while so while in the area for a work conference I had my family meet me for dinner. It is very noisy but that isn't surprising with how busy it is. The beer list is great. I got a weitbeir can't remember the name but it was good. I ordered the parmagedon sandwich with fries. Oh my goodness the sandwich is huge, enough for lunch the next day. The perogies in the sandwich  were delicious and the flavors all worked well together. The fries were great as well. Our waiter wasn't very attentive or friendly but we got the correct food quickly which is what really matters. I will have to stop the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I love Melt! Glad the Independence location opened up as it is close to home. We went on a Saturday night around 8 pm and there was a 1 hour 30 minute wait. This is typical! Glad we waited it out though because five min. later there were open seats at the bar and we were seated quickly. I got some kind of \"slinger\" mixed drink, I forget the name of it, but it was very good! Also ordered a side salad with homemade dressing, yum. The fries and coleslaw with my sandwich were good, although coleslaw was a little too peppery for my taste. For my sandwich I ordered the Westside Monte Cristo, not knowing how enormous it would be!! Wow! I only ate one third of it and took the rest home. Great berry sauce to go with the deep fried sandwich made up of ham, cheese, and turkey. My husband loved his Parmaggedon, too, which had pierogies on it. The only thing that was not on par was the service -- not for us, but for the people next to us. They arrived before us, ordered before us, and still had not been served by the time we were finished eating our meal. I felt bad for them, it just seemed like the restaurant didn't have the timing down pat. We had great service at the bar though and a very nice waitress! Can't wait to go back and try the sandwich with eggs and bacon on it, I forget the name of it."}
{"text":"Great options for vegetarians and vegans. The tofu wings were great. my mushroom sandwich was delicious. Sandwiches are big so get a half and it will fill you up. Cool decor. A must go to in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"HAPPY APRIL FOOLS!!!!!!! Um... this review has nothing to do w/ any FOOLING--for serious.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I was very excited at the prospect of eating here.  I was actually trying to convince a couple of our buddies to do the CHALLENGE.  However, none of it went down...  We arrived at about 8:00 PM and was told the wait would be nearly 2 hours.  That would've meant that our dinner start would have been 10:00 PM... now this was no fault of Melt but it was certain disappointing... the bar was filled with activity so there was no way I was going to stand around drinking while waiting.  I liked the fact that the had the TALL BOY cans of Pabst (24 fluid ounces) among a very extensive selection of IPAs... lots of beer here.  Again, in my old age w/ my rickity knees, I can't just stand around for 2 hours drinking... for you college boys and gals out there and other youngstas, this is the place for you!  The ambiance (for the 30 minutes that I experienced it before deciding to go somewhere else) was very cool.  The semi-dim lighting created a warm yet exciting atmosphere.  It was opening day so it was good to see some baseball playing on the LCDs that are scattered aplenty throughout the tavern-esque pub.  The crowd was great--and I'm not sure if there's a college nearby but it had a very COLLEGE-Y feel.  The crowd was great--again, I'm actually getting bored at how nice everybody in this town is."}
{"text":"Love it every time I visit there!! The sandwich sizes are huge. I had the Parma Italy this time--the chicken was so juicy and tender and was essentially a chicken parm sandwich with garlic bread!! I loved it so much I will order again very soon!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked since I saw it on Man v. Food. When one of my friends recommended it, it was just another sign that I needed to check this place out. The only thing is - it's not exactly in Cleveland. It's about a 20 minute drive out of the city, so if you have a car, that's fine. There's plenty of parking. But if you have to take a cab or public transportation (if it even goes there - not too sure since I'm not from around town), then it's not really worth it.  I had the Cleveland cheesesteak (braised pulled beef brisket, garlic mushrooms, sautéed onions & peppers, rosemary onion aioli, provolone). It comes with a side of fries but since we were already getting Hangover Fries (hand cut fries, seared pork belly, mozzarella cheese curd, rich gravy, fried sunny up egg & scallions), we subbed it for a soup for an extra $2.  The Hangover Fries is exactly what is sounds like. Or at least how I would imagine it - kind of like how you mix too many different types of drinks the night before, that don't belong together. It's a similar situation here. Everything sounded like it would taste good together, but it just didn't mesh well for some reason. It was too much. I think if I ate these during an actual hangover, I would probably vom.  But back to the sammies. The first few bites are good. Everything is packed with flavor. But then when everything starts falling apart, and the sauce is a bit much is when you start getting nauseous. It's one of those foods where you first eat it and you love it. But as you eat it more, you almost kind of hate it. I'm not saying I hate it. It wasn't that bad but it was just too heavy for me, which I was expecting. The roasted garlic tomato soup that I got, tasted like they poured tomato soup out of a jar.  My boyfriend had the Might Macaroni (macaroni & cheese battered and deep fried, layered with cheddar cheese sauce & your favorite Melted cheese). This again was too much for a sandwich. But I think it would be good as an appetizer (I think they have mac and cheese bites, which is probably the same thing). He wanted to add garlic as an add-on but they said they only had garlic powder, which was kind of weird...how are you going to count that as an \"add-on\" and then charge the customer $2 for some seasoning? Made no sense so he opted out of it. For his soup, he got the buffalo chicken chowder (creamy spicy soup with pulled chicken, blue cheese, celery, carrots & banana peppers). I liked this soup the best out of everything we ate. Surprisingly, it wasn't overly creamy.  Our waitress wasn't too attentive, but she was really nice. My boyfriend was about to order a full sandwich until she suggested that a half would be more than enough. So I'm glad that Melt isn't just out to hustle their customers (you know, garlic powder situation aside).  If you're nearby, maybe get half a sandwich to share. But fair warning - you WILL feel like a greasy bear afterwards!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to go to this place and when I finally went, I wasn't disappointed!   We didn't have to wait too long and we had a pretty big group. What I love is taht this place has a great bar and also great food to back it up! I mean, look at their sandwiches, they are HUGE! The coleslaw was meh, but the fries and that sandwich were amazing!  I had the Big Poppa sandwich, 4 cheese filled jalapeno peppers, between two pieces of toast with more cheese, then deep fried and covered in a bit of sugar and served with a jelly preserve. I will probably lose 3 years off my life, but it is worth it!  I will def come back and they always have a monthly special so it is a changing restaurant."}
{"text":"Really cool ambiance. We waited 10-15 minutes to be seated on a Thursday evening. Quick drink service. Waited several minutes after placing our order, but not for an unreasonable amount of time. Food was good- was not a fan of their fries. Service was really good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight with friends and yes there was a wait but what do you expect from a place that has been featured on every Food Network show there is?  The beer selection was great, the food was great, and the service was outstanding!  No wonder there was a wait here.  Friendly, neighborhood atmosphere and they don't try to pack you in nor do they rush you to turn the tables.  Everyone in our party said they would be back!  The Mote Christo, the Ruben, and the Godfather were great as were the fried Twinkies we just had to have - and the prices were very reasonable.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"The place is beyond noisy.  The service was friendly, but kind of lax.  The menu is confusing.  I had heard of this place and had high expectations during our recent visit to Cleveland.    Frankly, we were underwhelmed - except by the size of these sandwiches.  THEY ARE HUGE!  We each took home 1/2, and were glad that we had a fridge in our hotel room.  We had them for breakfast the next day, and sad to say, they were pretty miserable and messy after reheating in the microwave.  The sandwiches are good, but just too many flavors all at once.  It's like entering a room with ten different, glittering, loud colors when you bite into one of these things.    The wine list is very overpriced.  About 4X retail, which is entirely over the top for a super casual place.  We both agreed - if we were to return, we'd order simpler items, probably making up our own instead of the house specials."}
{"text":"Melt, you and I are just never going to see eye to eye.  After attending a Cavs game with my family, my sister remarked that she was hungry and wanted to try something new. I remembered that Melt had opened their new location in Independence, and I prefer to support local businesses instead of chain restaurants, so I threw that out as an option. My sister is a cheese fanatic, so she was on board immediately.  One of my issues with Melt has always been the wait time, but I figured at 9:15 on a Sunday evening, that wouldn't be an issue.  The Independence location is big and open, which I liked immediately. Our wait was only about 20 minutes (after being quoted 45-1hr). Our waitress was very cool and friendly. And the wait for the food was only an additional 20 minutes.  But the food, man. The food.  I ordered the Parmageddon. I loved everything in it--the pierogis were delicious, as was the fresh kraut (which was really more like delicious cooked cabbage). But Melt, where's the damn cheese? You're a grilled cheese spot, and there was maybe one slice of cheese on my gigantic sandwich? The bread-to-cheese ratio is my biggest gripe. The bread used is huge, and all it does is soak up the grease.  My sister had the Monte Cristo, which she loved while eating it but hated the second day. My dad demolished a Big Popper, and i'm not sure he actually tasted any of the sandwich. And our friend ordered the Chorizo and potato melt. The waitress recommended putting an egg on top, which he did, and he loved it.  I liked that we were able to substitute the veggies of the day for the cole slaw (because i hate cole slaw, unless it's from a Barberton chicken spot).  I know many people who are huge fanatics about Melt. And hey, hats off to you. I love the quirky decor, and the food at this location was served hot (which was a first for me and my Melt experiences). As a person who doesn't live close to a Melt location, I think that there are plenty of other restaurants in Cleveland that i'd rather dine at. I won't always rule the place out (especially this location), but it will never be a destination spot for me, or on the list of places i'll take my out of town guests."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, hoping for a good experience. Have I had one yet? Nope.  I like the atmosphere of Melt, love the artwork, and the wait staff is pretty good. My major issue is with the food.  Both times i have been there, my food has arrived at the table cold. When I think grilled cheese, i think melty, yummy, gooey cheese. i've never had that experience at Melt. The fries are gross, and the cole slaw? yuck.  I wanted to love Melt, i truly did. Otherwise I wouldn't have gone there twice. But both times, i was disappointed. If i'm going up to Cleveland, i'd rather spend a little more and have a hell of a shorter wait and go to BSpot for a burger."}
{"text":"When my family visited Cleveland this summer, I was excited to finally be able to try Melt!  We went to the new one on in Mentor on a Saturday night. We were prepared for a long wait but were pleasantly surprised to find the place half empty.  Our server was great with beer suggestions. I ended up getting a blonde type of beer which actually wasn't that good...but that happens when you try a variety of beers.   I didn't feel too adventurous that night and just went with a simple Kindergarten with ham. It was pretty tasty and really hit the spot. My Mom got the Wake and Bacon and I must have heard her say, \"Look how big this is! I can't finish THIS!\" 4x. She ate half and said she'd back for another.  My husband got the Caribbean War pig and said it was pretty big. He can put away a big serving and only ate half!   I like that they are kid friendly and have good selections for kids.   Excited to go back and try something else next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant. The staff is amazing and always making sure you have a great experience. I tried this months special \"The Firecracker Chicken\" and it was amazing. Spicy chicken, cheese, pineapple salsa and avocado. I really hope it becomes a regular sandwich it's that good. Hands down one of my favorite places to eat. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to stop in and check out the new Melt in Avon on a Saturday night and I'd say it's the nicest out of the 4 that I've been to throughout the years.  The place opened in the old Bar 145 location and they did a great job transforming it.  There's a ton of room inside and it's bright, clean, and less hipster compared to the Lakewood and Cleveland Heights locations. The front of house is very open, so you don't feel as cramped as in the other locations when you're waiting for your table. Like all Melt locations, it's pretty busy on weekends and they don't take reservations, but they have call ahead seating.  Our server was friendly and did a great job dealing with our loud group of 6 dudes.  The food was awesome and came out pretty quick. Much better than the experience I had at the Independence location!  If you're not familiar with Melt, they're known for their huge gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches and a tasty seasonal craft beer list. You won't leave here hungry, that's for sure! The original location is in Lakewood, but this new one in Avon is waaaay better and parking is much easier. Stop by and check it out!"}
{"text":"Melt is such a cozy place with the dim lighting and holiday decorations. I've been there a few times and it's been amazing every single time. It's a great place if you love carbs because the bread they use is thick and delicious. Last time I went there I got the Monte Cristo which was a perfect combination of sweet and savory. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I really like melt mentor. I go with my brother Chris P. the duke of mentor melt. I think the staff do a really nice job they are always friendly. We really like Ray and Josh and all the other servers. I usually get the half sandwich combo. It has just a plain grilled cheese half with a really nice sized salad tossed with choice of cheese and dressing. But it ALSO comes with a cup of soup AND goldfish crackers all for like 8 bucks. and I usually add a side of fries that are really cheap. They have other excellent sandwiches, and I like the jalapeno tartar sauce if they still have it. So it is a good place and they do a nice job."}
{"text":"Where else can you get a grilled cheese sandwich with 2 giant pierogies inside?  All of their sandwiches are made on really thick pieces of perfectly toasted bread with plenty of cheese.  The decor is fun; the menu is written on the back of an actual record album.  And they frequently put cartoons on the television (I'm guessing to go along with the whole \"grilled cheese is a kids sandwich\" vibe).  They've also got an extensive selection of beers available on tap."}
{"text":"Went there while visiting family in Ohio.  There was no wait for a table on a Friday night. Service was fast and friendly. They were out of a few beers listed on the menu and the one monthly special beer, which was disappointing.  Everyone loved their food except me. I had the fried green tomato sandwich and it had way too much remoulade on it. I Definitely will go back, but I won't have that sandwich again."}
{"text":"Awesome Service! Friendly Service! Lots of food! Huge Portions! Food was GREAT! Awesome Decor!! Clean Restaurant!! BEST SERVICE we had in the past 5 days in Independence, OH!!! The only thing i would change would be to turn the much down 1 notch :) Thanks guys for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great bar feel, fun & doesn't take itself too seriously - Boomerang, Cartoon Network & ESPN on the bar tv's. Great selection of beers. Great fries, good coleslaw with every sandwich. Best tuna sandwich I've ever had - The Tokyo Tuna. Tuna steak, Wasabi sauce, lettuce, tomato, muenster cheese melted and toasted of course. Saw Melt featured on food network, two days later I found out I would be working in Cleveland for 1 day. I knew exactly where I was going to eat and it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I had the godfather once and it was meh...ok.. But that potato bacon bomb omg!!!!!!!!!! It was a special of the month and it sucks cuz I've been craving it the sauce was too die for!! Please bring it back I don't wanna wait another year!!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD - HORRIBLE OPERATIONS - I went in for lunch and it was an odd experience even getting seated.  Our party totals were messed up with another party.  NBD there, but we were seated and then not acknowledged by a server for about 5 minutes, which we then gave our full order.  It was over 30 minutes after that where we finally gave up and walked out!  The whole time we sat there without a single visit from our server.  I could see the kitchen staff hovering around the window, trying to figure out what needs to go out and not actually working on thins to get those orders out.  It just seemed like their operational processes were horrible.  Keeping an efficient kitchen, training your servers, and maintaining a well organized hostess station is the operational aspect of restaurant management and Melt is very lacking.  When telling my friend of the experience, he said \"oh yeah, that happened to me twice there.\"  WHAT?!?!?!  How is that possible?"}
{"text":"I went to this Melt yesterday after raves from my sister for quite some time about Melt in general (and recently seeing it on Man v. Food).  I had a great time. They told us repeatedly that dine-in was 1 1/2 hours, carry-out was 45 minutes. If you don't want to wait - don't come here, you've been warned.  My group found 5 seats at the bar together (on July 4th weekend) where we had an amazing time. The bartenders that were serving us were really nice and helpful. Juan is awesome! He told us about the drink specials and even let us try some Blueberry drink and Lavender Mojito. He was really funny, cute and helpful to Melt newbies. My friend also got Hotel Phuket, cucumber/thai drink, really good.  The sandwiches: Oh WOW. If you don't want greasy, fall-out of the bread goodness, then don't go here. It's piled high, cheesy, bad-for-you amazingness. I got the Chorizo&Hash brown, it was AWESOME. (My mom doesn't like chorizo and tried my left over, she loved it.) My friends ordered The Godfather (lasagna sandwich, it was so-so), Big Popper (jalapeno pepper one--awesome, but spicyyy), Parmageddon (pierogis-really good), Summer Chicken (also really good). (Sidenote: At the bar, it took about 35 minutes for our sandwiches to come out)  Overall we were very satisfied with our meals, the warning about the wait, the bartending staff, and the cheesy goodness that made up the sandwiches. I'd go back in a heart-beat."}
{"text":"Yuck!!! We detoured to try this place. The DDD feature is now off the menu. The Monte Cristo was inedible. It was so thickly breaded and fried it could not be cut. It was greasy and you couldn't taste the meat or cheese. Homemade chips were also greasy, over cooked, and badly needed at least salt. The Cleveland cheese steak was just weird tasting with a side of bland potato salad (again needs salt!) The iced tea was so so...didn't taste fresh brewed but the Pepsi was good! Our server was wonderful and it is a really cute place with cool decor but the food....?"}
{"text":"Funky, eclectic, and a ton of fun. From the \"pumpkin of destiny\" where you pick out your name for the waiting list to the inventive menu, a must stop when in Cleveland. I had the Parmageddon...pirogues on a sandwich, who'd a thunk it? Very good. Served with a ton of fries too. Glad I didn't get an appetizer. I'll be back when I am in Cleveland for sure."}
{"text":"Went there this past weekend.  It was fairly crowded for a Sunday evening, and we had a 30-minute wait.  I had the Parmageddon sandwich, which is basically grilled cheese with pierogies in the middle.  It was delicious.  I would definitely get this again.  Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert.  The beer list was also pretty extensive.  Our server was quite knowledgeable about most of the beers on the list, which I appreciated.  I'm knocking one star off because of the parking situation.  It's mostly metered parking in the area."}
{"text":"5 stars. 5 stars. 5 stars. From the Burger Time Arcade Game to the BBQ Tofu to the mounds of Vegan options, this place was heaven. Why are you not in Detroit??? I'm still thinking about that fresh sauerkraut on my sandwich and those yummy Pierogis. If I ever go back to Cleveland  (and I hope I do!) I am soooooooo going back here.  Do not pass it. You will regret it."}
{"text":"War pig w espresso and ancho pulled pork, pork belly, tamale cake, and mole sauce. Boulder chocolate porter. Tofu buffalo 'wings'.  I was very impressed with the tofu. If I closed my eyes I would have thought I was eating wings. The sandwich was great. The combination was perfect to give the sandwich a real Mexican vibe. Service was ok and beer selection was huge. A Cleveland original that I'll continue to support."}
{"text":"I went here for my first time and I was blown away. Where to start? The server was extremely helpful and checking on us regularly we where seated fast also we made it just before the dinner crowd. The cocktails where amazing I got the electric lemonade and my wife got the melt Margarita.   As far as good it was absolutely amazing. My kids ordered of the kids menu and got the kids size grilled cheese and chicken tenders. I ordered the Monte Cristo half sandwich and filled me up it was a Swiss and cheddar over ham battered and deep fried with a raspberry jelly to dip and powdered suger. It was so melty and cheesy I want to go back for another. My wife got the smokey Russian which she said she enjoyed looked like a good sandwich too.    So 2 kids meals 2 cocktails and 2 half sandwiches and fries came to 47 bucks not bad deal. There was bar seating too if your into that I am if I'm alone. all in all vegan or meat eater there is something for everyone here and I'm glad I tried it im gonna be back soon."}
{"text":"A great place for cheese lovers. Everything comes with cheese!  I think I will spend more time crafting my own sandwich next time instead of choosing one they've presented on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Melt pretty much since the day they opened and I have never been disappointed.  They always have unique special items on their menu and their regular daily selections are also delish.  I have yet to try anything I didn't love.  And their beer selection???  I'm in heaven!!  I would recommend getting veggies on the side vs fries if you are having a sandwich because it is way to much fried food otherwise!!!  Trust me, your tummy will thank me later!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the combo half sandwich, soup and salad. My husband loved the breakfast sandwich and our son could barely get his mouth around the Club sandwich."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are ridiculously big (recommend sharing one), but very good.  Fun and eclectic place.  Highly recommend a follow up visit.  See you there!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday afternoon at about 4PM. It took forever to even find the check-in station and when I found it, the host was very cold and rude. He informed me that there was a 2 hour wait (!!) for a table of 4, which seemed ridiculous for the day and time. No apologies, no empathy, just some surly contempt for making his night marginally busier than it was before.  My party waited for awhile and were almost run down by the waitstaff. There really was no proper place to wait and if 1-2 hours is the norm, that is unacceptable. They don't provide the buzzers for when your table is ready, instead using some asinine nametag system, therefore we were afraid to wander away from the little waiting area. We ended up leaving, which is a shame because I really wanted to try this place. I hope to update with a proper review at some point in the future."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. Food is so-so. Not sure if I would come back again. Good atmosphere. Parking is difficult being on the corner of a busy street."}
{"text":"Melt is.. awesome!  I was honestly not really expecting a whole lot from the online menu due to the high prices for a grilled cheese place, but I'm very glad to have given it a shot.  The prices are indeed high, but the portions are huge.  I had been going to Winking Lizard quite a bit due to its closeness, but Melt is a much better value.  A dollar or 2 more for nearly twice as much food.  I could barely finish, but I wanted to so badly because everything tasted amazing.  I had the veggie burger, which is served on bread like a sandwich, with smoked gouda.  The burger itself was thick and perfectly cooked with a mild sweetness that you don't usually find in a veggie burger... but it worked.  The fries were very well done... not those greasy stringy fries you find at a lot of pubs.  They went perfectly with sriracha mixed with some ketchup.  The coleslaw was also way better than I thought that it would be.  I'm not normally a huge fan of vinegar based slaw, but this stuff was some of the best I've ever had.  I don't know what they put in the stuff, but it probably involves crack considering how impossible it is to stop eating.  The beer selection is also quite good with pretty fair prices even durning non happy hour.  I will absolutely be back, and when I eventually move from Cleveland after school I have a feeling that this place will be missed the most.  The only downside is that parking can be a bit of a challenge, but that seems pretty common around this area."}
{"text":"Great concept done exceedingly well.  Great brew selection and atmosphere.  Food is great - can be a long wait but worth it"}
