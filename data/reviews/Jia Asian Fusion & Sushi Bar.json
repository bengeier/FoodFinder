{"text":"We go at least once a month and travel over 30 minutes just to go here. Susan the server is absolutely our favorite. The sushi is top notch quality compared to many Charlotte Restaurants. Every appetizer we have tried has been fantastic. I love that there is a small restaurant in this area that is producing some amazing quality cuisine!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Gastonia; so much our favorite, we go there every other week.  Whether you are wanting their delicious sushi, or one of their Asian dishes, they are just the best.  And, if you are a tea lover like me, they have the best tea ever.  Our very special dish is the Lobster Cha Cha, and if you want to make the meal even better, start with an order of the Dynamite Shrimp.  All the staff at Jia are wonderful, but our very favorite is Suzan.  She makes you feel special and welcomed.  Jia will not disappoint!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food! Sushi was nice, staff was friendly and accommodating, overall a great place to eat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town, great sushi. The Pot Stickers are the best dumplings in the area. They have some really nice entrees, especially the seafood (the snapper is super). Really big portions. They have sake and beers if you want a drink. Great all around, big fan."}
{"text":"Service and food were absolutely wonderful. 

This restaurant has been named one of gaston county's finest, and in one publication it was labeled a \"must try restaurant\". 

I ordered garlic chicken and the dynamite shrimp as an appetizer. The shrimp had an appropriate kick of spice. I loved them! The garlic chicken was delicious, but the lunches of my friends made me want to try so many more dishes! 

I will most certainly be back and tell my friends to eat here!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Great service, good prices and delicious food! My wife and I have had lunch here the past three weekends in a row and I can't wait to go back. We used to travel to Charlotte to get good sushi and I'm so happy to have found this place so close to home. The hot and sour soup is also the best I have ever had. Do yourself a favor and go there today! Your tastebuds will thank you!"}
{"text":"This was the absolute best place me and my fiancée have had Asian food at. The food tasted great and the presentation of the Sushi and flavor was amazing. The customer service was great also. The Host and waiter were both great! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Gastonia and also one of the few places that can handle our kids' dairy, egg, and nut allergies. Great sushi and lunch specials and fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here before going to a haunted house the weekend before Halloween.  A third girl was supposed to join us, but the waitress was understanding and did not show any sign of irritation when she didn't show up.

I had California and Philadelphia rolls. They were delicious.  My friend ordered the crab Rangoon, which left some to be desired.  The outside flaky crust was tasteless.

Our waitress visited our table often and was very friendly.  She was never too pushy about ordering more drinks or dessert.

The only other turn off was a manager or other worker chastised the two hosts relatively loudly at their station.  That seemed unprofessional to me. While I understand she was upset that she had not known about a table being seated, that matter should have been handled more privately."}
{"text":"I've been to Jia three times. The sushi is excellent,  lo mein was excellent, and the lettuce wraps are to die for. It's much better than any other Asian restaurant around. Service is great as well. I will be a return customer!"}
{"text":"A really nice place to stop in and eat. Very pleasant service and very clean. We enjoyed all the different dishes we had here, but we enjoyed the Sushi Rolls the most. My wife didn't like sushi before we tried this place, now she loves it, as long as it is prepared the Jai way.  Stop by and give them a try, order what you like to eat, and you will be glad you did. Chopsticks or silverware, your choice."}
{"text":"Love the new location!!!  It now offers plenty of seating & a very nice sushi bar to sit at. We went for lunch. The portions were large & very delicious and only $7-8 each. Great prices, great food and most importantly, great service!!!"}
{"text":"So I saw a lot of reviews about here and majority were good so I tried this place out. Ate by myself so sat at the sushi bar. The girl that took care of me was very attentive. I hat the dinner combo with soup. That was very filling. A good variety of fish, it was fresh and  good. I would definitely eat here again when I'm back in this town. I travel for work."}
{"text":"this place rocks!! i eat here quite often. their thai coconut soup is to die for!! their sushi is always fresh and made on the spot!! the service is friendly helpful and fast. would recommend this place everytime to anyone."}
{"text":"Great local spot for sushi and Asian fusion. I always get Tuna Tataki and a Sunomono Salad to start. From there, pile on some great nigiri and any specialty rolls and you won't be disappointed. Ask for their special sushi menu to get some variety. Reasonably priced at $11-$13 for most specialty rolls, and far better than surrounding competitors like Akahana, Sakura, and the inexpensive spots like Sake."}
{"text":"Had the Chinese Chicken Salad with wonton  strips and cashews.  Excellent!  Very friendly service too.  Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! The best Chinese food that I have found in the area with extremely good service.  It reminds me of home - San Francisco!  Now that we have found it we will be regulars! !"}
{"text":"We met friends here from out of town, everything was perfect. The food was all really delicious and the service outstanding. Even though there was wait to get in we never felt rushed after our meal while catching up with our friends. Will definitely return for more awesome sushi even if it is a long drive from So. Charlotte."}
{"text":"Sushi is really good and nice lunch special deals on it too.  What I really love is the Shanghai Fried rice.  You get such a humongous portion of it and is very delicious.  Only problem, they need a website with an online menu, I kept losing the take out menu and had to try to order from memory, my food, over the phone. Other than that, well done Jia!"}
{"text":"Wow how did I not know about this place. The lettuce wraps were awesome! Our food was delicious.  The sushi looked absolute gorgeous!  We will definitely be back. One of the best restaurants in Gastonia.  If you haven't been you should!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. The one Sushi establishment I approve in Gastonia. Sushi is definitely a must try. Creative and fish quality is fairly fresh. Friendly, caring and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Jia is consistently delicious. Be sure to try the lettuce wraps as an appetizer. They are light and flavorful. Since learning about this restaurant last month we've been back quite a few times. I've tried the sesame chicken, broccoli beef, Mongolian beef, tiger roll, and crunchy tuna roll. All have been delectable! This is my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fantastic place to eat with the family! I highly recommend this place! Fresh sushi, and the food is amazing. McCathern"}
{"text":"Jia is a star in the area. The owner has moved to a new location and the service and quality is exceptional. I recommend that you try the pan fried sea bass very very good.  The sushi is very good as well.  We have this quality without having to drive to Charlotte"}
{"text":"Was out of town on business and had a craving for sushi..... I found this little sushi place in Gastonia NC. I was very impressed will everything i ordered and how fresh my sushi was.  If your in town or just passing through and have a craving this is definitely worth the few mile trip off I-85."}
{"text":"Jia is truly one of the best restaurants in Charlotte - period. The food is phenomenal.  The sushi ranks amongst the best I have had in Asia, NYC or LA. But everything on the menu is great. If you haven't tried the Shanghi Fried Rice or the curry you are missing a real treat. And the staff is exceptionally attentive and funny at the same time, making it feel like you are just having dinner with friends. This is a must Go...but just don't take my seat."}
{"text":"Best choice for sushi and Asian food in the entire state as far as I am concerned. It's really amazing. The quality of sushi is amongst some of the best I've ever tasted. Servers are super nice the atmosphere is great. I absolutely will not settle for sushi anywhere else. We drive 30 minutes just to get here it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better options in the Gastonia/Belmont area...we really enjoy the sushi. Some of the best around. I like the chicken pad thai, which is filling but not terribly spicy. The sparerib appetizer and gyoza (fried dumplings) are awesome! Chicken basil dish is wonderful...and my teen son discovered there's enough to top a package of Ramen the next day for leftovers!

Great staff, nice location. Definitely drop by!"}
{"text":"Jia never disappoints. BEST hot & sour soup I have ever had in my life! The hostesses are all so warm and friendly, and the wait staff is on top of things. The drunken noodles and Hunan chicken are two of my favorite dishes. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place ever! The staff are great and the food is amazing! It's a great place for families"}
{"text":"A good place to eat. Sushi is top notch for Gastonia. Also, try the Curry, it's made with coconut like Jamaican style. It is excellent. Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Absolutely loved the sushi. Lots of different and creative rolls to choose from. Everything was fresh and delicious.  There were others in my group who ate off their regular menu and enjoyed their food as well. Overall a great experience....I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love the cashew chicken but I honestly don't think you could go wrong with any choice you make here. Everything tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Plenty of variety on the menu. My son who doesnt eat Asian food really enjoyed the lettuce wraps and scallops. The sushi  is delicious and fresh. There is a good selection of beer. The staff is friendly and attentive. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sushi is INCREDIBLE.  The creativity of the sushi chef seems to have no limits.  Other dishes are very good, but I can' t get enough of their sushi.  

Nice and friendly staff, great service, and good quality food."}
{"text":"I love the sushi (and quality). My entire family loves the food here never a complaint, and to-go orders have always been correct. Best Chapanese fusion near Cramerton."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi nothing fancy. Ordered the spicy basil mussel it had a good flavor but the mussels were tiny. Fried soft shell crab was tasty. Next ordered the sashimi dinner & chirachi bowl basically the same thing. Only had tuna, salmon, white tuna & yellowtail not much of a selection. Wasn't bad just wasn't great."}
{"text":"Jia is reasonably priced with an inviting ambiance. The food is very high quality. The chicken is always perfect --never sinewy or chewy. My boyfriend says their sushi is some of the best he's tasted, and it's priced well enough he can easily try new kinds whenever we go. You always get more than enough food. I'm excited to introduce this place to others."}
{"text":"I dined in on a Sunday evening with my little one. There was no wait and we were sat promptly. This was our first time and we had looked at the menu before going in so we knew what we wanted already. Our server was attentive and took our drink and food order at the same time. I ordered a hot and sour soup to have before my entree and that came out at a decent time. The reason for my 4 star review is because of the wait time to get food. Our (1 kid and 1 adult) entrees took right above 40 minutes to come. This to me was aggravating because this was not a full house, or even close. I noticed a table around whom were there before me  and get their food after me- they were irritated as well. The food on the other hand-amazing! So I can say it was \"worth the wait.\" I will be returning and recommending it to others."}
{"text":"So, the service has been getting worse over time. The high school kids that seem to be running the place are soooooooo bad. They need to be trained in service. The food is still good, more average then great. The price to value has now gotten to a point that we will look for a new place. 

Bye."}
{"text":"First time.  Food was wonderful and priced right for lunch.  Glad it was busy since that  means they are overcoming the location challenge .  pot stickers  (steamed) were very tender as was the beef in my sa cha beef with noodles. 

Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Love this place, fresh delicious sushi and great hibachi.  The server was nice and helpful when selecting the sushi.  Clean floors and tables, also didnt have to ask for a refill."}
{"text":"I will have to give them a second chance....
Stopped by for lunch last week. I did not receive what the pictures that have been posted indicated. Service was great, fish was meh. I will have to try dinner and reevaluate."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices - went here with 4 kids, and they were nice and accommodating. Try dynamite shrimp. Friendly staff, we left behind a stuffed animal, they ran to the parking lot to return it."}
{"text":"My go to place for sushi has just changed to J'ia. Wow!  What a fantastic selection to choose from. We ordered a few rolls to start with and finished with a noodle dish. Everything was presented beautifully and tasted fresh and delicious. Our server was excellent. Don't let the strip mall location scare you. This is definitely Gaston County's best sushi."}
{"text":"One word... Amazing!!! The food and the staff exceeded my expectations . We got the crab Rangoon , two different sushi rolls and the beef and broccoli , everything tasted super fresh ! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I came here again for dinner, my first dine in. 
It looked busy but we were seated pretty quick. We started with the mussels. I'm not a big fan of mussels, I find them rubbery and tasteless but I convinced myself to give them a shot based on other reviews. Boy, am I glad I did!! They were absolutely delicious, the sauce had coated them well and it was so flavorful!!! 

I had the seafood noodle soup but I substituted the scallops for more of the rest. The menu said it contained crabmeat and I asked the waiter if it was REAL crabmeat or imitation. He told me real, ' like we use in the sushi' . What a lie!! It was the weird, disgusting imitation crabmeat! But there wasn't much of it thankfully, most of it was nice, plump shrimp! If you try this add a dash of lemon to it! Tastes amazing! 
Hubby had the firebird/firecracker( not sure which it is) sushi and really liked it.
For dessert we had the chocolate mousse cake which it's a good dose of chocolate!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi
This is a great place the service was impeccable,the food amazing 
Atmosphere was awesome 
Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Great food. Presentation is awesome, selection was vast, and the taste was something you don't get often in the Carolinas."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for what I wanted.......any guess Sushi yes their Sushi is fresh vibrant affordable & plentiful. I thoroughly enjoyed every thing we ordered We went back for round two & my 3 yr. old daughter enjoyed the experience please don't deprive yourself of a proper meal by this place"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their lunch specials.  Great food, and a good price.  Their red curry is delicious.  My wife gets the chicken version. I go with the shrimp. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"We found out new favorite somewhat local Asian restaurant.  It's a smaller place with average atmosphere but the food was great.  We have been twice in the past couple of weeks, once for pad Thai and the second for sushi. Both were much better than anything not near uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wow! Super impressed with this hidden gem. Polite and attentive wait staff and wonderful food. We all left with full bellies. I highly recommend the sushi entree and my husband recommends the Chilean sea bass."}
{"text":"This is my family's FAVORITE sushi and Asian restaurant. The food is fantastic, and the service is also great. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I shared sushi. It was delicious. We started with the yellowtail negiri  and then had the  seared tuna roll. Our favorite was the dragon tiger roll, soft shell crab. Yummy. We will return."}
{"text":"I usually order a combination Lo mein with no veggies at any Asian place that sells it, and so I tried Jia's. I got it with veggies this time, and it honestly was amazing. The next time I went back, I didn't ask for no veggies it was so great. The first time they let me combine shrimp/scallops. The scallops were perfection, so were the shrimp. The second time I had beef/chicken/shrimp (wouldn't let me do shrimp/scallops over the phone, I guess?) but omg even the take out was amazing. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews and seeing that this restaurant was rated 4.5 stars by 75 people I decided to give them a try. After driving 20mins there and to get back home. I attempted to eat this food with my fiance and I just couldn't. I was anything but impressed. We both ordered the bourbon chicken, me with white rice, and my fiance with fried rice and I also ordered the crab ragoon. For one, as many times as I've had bourbon chicken I've never seen or had it breaded. Breading the chicken, tossing it is sauce, and then putting steaming hot food in a closed plastic container is going to do nothing but make the food soggy and that's exactly what happened. My rice was fine, but my fiancé so called fried rice was a combination of sticky and soggy and my crab ragoon was not at all sweet. We were so disappointed. He ate his food, he's a man and will eat anything if he's hungry enough and this place isn't cheap so he certainly wasn't going to waste his money. I on the other hand couldn't do it, it was horrible. I would have been better off getting the 2 entrees and a side from the food court at the mall for $6.99. My food would have been good, cheaper, and closer to my house. I will never try them again and would not recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food and staff!  Ask for Phon for your server, she's amazing! Best sushi in town!"}
{"text":"We are return customers at this establishment and We are never disappointed.  The food is always fresh and prompt, our order is always accurate, and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Service was good...sushi tasted fresh..we ordered three different sushi, they were very good..this place is a hidden gem"}
{"text":"You want to talk about false advertising in a good way!  My husband and I went to this restaurant for lunch and of course ordered off the lunch menu.  We're expecting the usual-sized portions for a lunch meal but we were rather shocked when we got this HUGE plate filled with all the food we could possibly eat!  I had mala chicken and it was very yummy and just a tiny bit spicy and the basil was infused throughout the entire dish instead of just put in as an afterthought.  My husband had the crusted snapper and for the price you just couldn't beat it; heck, it could have cost double that and he would have gladly gotten it again!  Add the complimentary soup and egg roll and we couldn't even eat HALF of what they brought us!  We got a sushi roll to share just in case we didn't get much along the lines of portions and the roll was fabulous both in taste AND presentation; it might explain why we were only able to eat HALF of our entrees!  We're already planning a return trip to Jia's on our next date night!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a great date night destination for us. We love all the staff, they are so friendly. We especially love Bryson, the bartender. When you stop in, have him whip up one of his specialty drinks,"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was great. The beer selection was small, but it offered some excellent beers that I have not been able to find elsewhere in Gastonia. We will be back."}
{"text":"The best ever! So so so good! We ordered 7 rolls and they were amazing! Each one unique flavors. We eat a lot of sushi and this was some of the best the fish was so fresh mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Besides needing a little upgrade in decor, we enjoyed eating here. The sushi was good, great presentation, and staff was very nice. Quick service. My husband loved the volcano roll. Have had better spicy tuna rolls but tasted fresh. Will be back when ever in the area."}
{"text":"Solid 4-stars. 
As expected, the sushi at any Pan Asian place is going to be substandard, but the Thai things we got were above average."}
{"text":"I have been to Jia for over 10 times, I think I should write a review for my most favorite restaurant in Gastonia! If you like sushi, here is the place! They use very fresh fish and sushi rice is just right! If you don't like sushi, you can always find many other choice, great food, great price, highly recommend this place, must try!"}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's favorite restaurant EVER. If you're coming here for sushi, ask for the specialty sushi menu!! The Monkey Roll (pictured) is my favorite sushi roll, and I eat sushi a LOT!! The Rock N Roll and Tiger roll are awesome too. I brought my mom here and she ordered the orange chicken (pictured) and loved it. That picture was after she finished eating!! Portions are huge! The spicy basil mussels are amazing as well, we get them as an appetizer almost every time we come. The spring rolls are great. Honestly, everything here is fantastic. If you haven't been here you are missing out!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!
Had the Tiger Roll, wife had the sushi combo plate, others at the table had \"normal\" meals.
Excellent food, good atmosphere, friendly staff. Would definitely return & recommend.
Amount of food for lunch price is a steal!"}
{"text":"Asian Fusion, Sushi, awesome. Shrimp LoMein, delicious. Excellent lunch offerings. Look forward to returning. Service and presentation,  outstanding!."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for lunch now. They have a list of lunch specials 11am-3pm. I've had their Sesame Chicken ($7), General Tso's Chicken ($7), and Mongolian Beef ($7.50). All 3 were delicious. The Sesame Chicken and General Tso's Chicken both came with a side of broccoli. The lunch specials come with choice of white rice, fried rice (50 cents extra), or brown rice (50 cents extra). It also comes with a side of spring roll, egg roll (1 piece), or crab rangoon (2 pieces). Hot and Sour soup or Miso soup or salad can be added for an additional $1. Their food tastes great, but it takes forever for it to be prepared! On each occasion, even when it wasn't busy at the restaurant, it still took what felt like an eternity for the food to finally be served. I'd say it took at least 15-20 minutes the first time I tried this place. This aspect needs improvement."}
{"text":"I have some really good food here. I would recommend the one to go to for good Chinese or sushi."}
{"text":"This place is great! Sushi is always fresh. The drink combos are super tasty. Many girly drinks made with saki. The green saki drink is my favorite, it tastes like a jolly rancher. It is always crowded with a wait, I am unsure if they take reservations. It does take awhile for food to come, but you will leave happy!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  Delicious, fresh and beautifully presented sushi.  The red curry chicken was tasty, also.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went to Jia as a loyal customer been going for months now since I've moved and haven't had an issue until last night. The waiter took our drinks and brought them out promptly, it would be the last time they were prompt about anything though. We waited half an hour. Yes half an hour for our food to be ordered and then another half hour for them to come back to check on us. No refills on our drinks, we had to remind them to do that. All of this while the table next to us is getting the best service possible. They even commented on how bad our service was. Needless to say after sitting 1 hour and 25 minutes, we decided to get our food to go. Luckily the chefs got this correct and everything tasted great. When we let the hostess know what happened, they blew it off like nothing happened and gave us an empty apology. We spoke to the manager on the phone and they said they'd speak to their team. Again, food - great, service - stay on them if you want your food."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best Asian food in North Carolina.  The service was fast, prices very reasonable for \"lunch specials\" and quality of food was very good.  We had the Kung Pao Chicken and Mala Chicken; they were both excellent.  The waitress recommended their sushi, but we did not have the chance to try it--but other customers seemed pleased with their sushi orders.  Highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for fresh, quality Asian food.  The waitress was very friendly, and way above average in service."}
{"text":"Good sushi,  but little high priced compared to other eateries to get sushi.   Recommend for food taste,  but not for prices."}
{"text":"This place is really not that good. Items on the menu don't list all of the ingredients so be careful if you have allergies. The sushi is honestly and truly just sub par. There isn't enough variety, rolls are small and you pay way too much for what you get. There are other options within a similar distance that are better quality and price. Staff is nice though, but the staff is also nice elsewhere."}
{"text":"After hearing nothing but good things about Jia, I decided to take my wife there on Monday for a belated mother day lunch. It was a hit! First, the sushi was excellent and very reasonable priced. We split a few rolls (the mango/ salmon roll was very good with an excellent flavor) and the eel roll was also one of the best I've had. 

Also had a salad with ginger dressing. It was very good! The ginger dressing was neither too pungent nor too sweet. Just right! The salad was made from a nice spring mix, not just iceberg lettuce.

The entrees, however, were incredible. I had the red snapper with chili sauce. It only cost 7 something, but if I had paid 15 dollars for this entree I still would not have been disappointed. It was plentiful and the chili sauce was fantastic. My wife was very happy with her hibachi chicken, but we both agree the red snapper was incredible (she stole a piece).

The service was great. Very friendly wait staff who actually waited until our sushi appetizer was finished to bring out our hot, fresh food. Very appreciative of them! This is a new stop when we're in Gastonia and wanting some great sushi and asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in this area! Love their rolls wrapped in cucumber and the pineapple fried rice!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Gaston County. I love the jalapeño yellow tail and the sashimi is awesome. The new location is super crowded and wait times were too much but I'm sure they will work out the kinks of seemingly being understaffed.  Nice bar too and they have a few IPA beers."}
{"text":"Great and very fresh sushi !! Very friendly staff. We had hard time choosing from all the sushi selections and everything was delicious and made with care. Oh and also try the plum wine if you like sweet wines. Soooo good !!"}
{"text":"Usually me and my guy have to travel to Charlotte to get sushi because sushi places in Gastonia aren't good. After reading the reviews of Jia asian fusion, I decided to make a trip. I ordered some sushi and spring rolls for an appetizer. The spring rolls tasted fresh, but a bit on the greasy side.. My sushi came out not too long after. I was pleasantly surprised at how good and fresh it was.
This place used to be Hsia(?) chinese restaurant.. I used to go there all the time and was sad when it closed down. I'm glad another great restaurant opened up in its place.
I can't wait to come back again and try their entrees."}
{"text":"Sushi is great, however, over 1 hour waiting... still no raw sushi roll...on a Monday night at 7:00... How is that ok?? And how does that make sense?!? Between the 2 of us we ordered only 2 rolls... they better figure out their volume control before moving into their new larger location... just sayin' ! #slowAF #stillwaiting

oh better yet...went inside at 8:10 to ask about our rolls and THEY WERENT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING READY... wtf I mean really over an hour after we ordered and still no where near being ready ... don't waste your time folks ...

Ohhh and the place wasn't busy at all... again maybe they should think about that before moving to their new location..."}
{"text":"This is a really great Chinese restaurant in Gastonia.  I've eaten several chicken plates and all have been good.  Last time I got the tofu lo me in plate.  The prices are reasonable and I love that they have healthy options.  You can choose between brown, fried, and white rice.  There is also sushi, but I have never tried it.  The location maybe isn't the best since it's a little away from the main part of town, but Jia's is worth a visit."}
{"text":"We recently went to the newly opened location.  Very spacious and nicely appointed.  The food is still excellent and there is now a full bar. We are happy with the new location and very pleased that the quality."}
{"text":"LOVE SUSHI? This is the best we think no we have ever had!!! BUT....
They have an appetizer of a wasabi, pork dumpling!!!!!! OMG! To die for!!! Worth getting just 2 orders of them and then \"drop the fork, but there is loads of FRESH sushi. They also have typical Japanese/Chinese/Thai dishes to choose from. No complaints there! 
Everything we've take out or \"eaten there,) has been great. The only reason after 2-3 times of eating there, is that the atmosphere is not great at all. Loud, Bright, uncomfortable chairs etc. changing all of that could be done overnight.  I suggest that they do. I was there a year or so ago, but my husband has picked me up carry out a lot of times since. 
Well worth the yummyness here!"}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good. Much better than sakura. Service was fine, my only gripe was the tables were really close together and its pretty small. I felt cramped and like I was sitting with the table next to me. Overall probably your best best for sushi in gastonia"}
{"text":"Sushi is always fresh and portions are excellent. Can't wait till they move to their new (and larger) location!"}
{"text":"A five star Asian restaurant in Gastonia? \"Pshaw!\" I say. Well, yesterday I gratefully ate those words and enjoyed every bite. Located in a strip mall in South Gastonia with heavily tinted windows. What lurks within? Wow, atmosphere!! Totally not expecting to feel like I entered a relatively upscale restaurant.
Very friendly and helpful waitress - she happily asked the kitchen at least three questions about food for us. She even knew to put in apps first and actually give us time to enjoy them.
Chicken Satay($6):  marinated in coconut milk served with peanut sauce.
Spicy Basil Mussels ($8):one of my favorite dishes of the meal, Chilean mussels pan fried with onions, hot peppers, green peppers and a killer sauce - full of flavor.
Spring Rolls ($3): crispy crunchy with ground chicken and sweet sauce.
Pan Fried Dumplings ($6): nice smoky flavor from the wok, great texture and taste.
Thom Ka ($3.50): huge bowl of delicious coconut soup - large pieces of fresh mushrooms and chicken.
Mr. Flowers Roll ($10); spicy tuna, avocado, tempura shrimp, romaine lettuce and masago. Yum...
We aslo ordered some basic sushi rolls and some orange peel chicken. Everything was fresh, good quality and wonderful. Was introduced to Lucky Buddha beer which I dare say, may replace TsingTao as my favorite Chinese Beer.
Five of us gorged ourselves for $64.
And for dessert a big tasty helping of \"Pshaw!\""}
{"text":"Happy JIA has a new bigger location but the hosts up front could do a better job managing the front for JIA's guest. Like acknowledging them! I hope the food service is still good."}
{"text":"I'm noticing a trend. They sit the black people in the very last booth across from the bathroom!!  I have been her Many times and even when they first open at 11am. Why are you walking me all the way to back of the restaurant. And when the next next start coming in for the ouch rush they sit them ALL in the front. That's not cool!"}
{"text":"Very nice, authentic Chinese food. Excellent sushi, made-to-order. Also enjoyed the pot stickers and orange peel beef. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to Burlington, NC and stopped at JAI for a quick bite on a Friday around 6:00 pm. The parking lot was full and there were people waiting (I assume 30 min wait time?) but the bar had plenty of seats available. We sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs were very friendly! We had quick service- egg rolls, dynamite shrimp, 4 sushi rolls and a hibachi meal were delivered to us and we finished eating within an hour. We had the Franklin roll, Baja roll, double happy roll and spicy tuna roll (see picture below)!! The place has a nicer yet casual atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great sushi!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant - I must have not eaten at the same place - or something with similar name - everything was great - very fresh - service was good"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Asian restaurant in Gaston County! Huge menu of delicious entrees as well as an expansive sushi menu. They can easily accommodate picky kids, gluten-sensitive folks and vegetarians as well as good, old-fashioned carnivores like yours truly, feeding us all in perfect harmony :-) 

I highly recommend the crab Rangoon (LOTS of crab inside) the Franklin Roll for sushi (deep fried deliciousness), and the broccoli Triple Crown for dinner (meat, meat, meat!). Everything was fresh, perfectly seasoned, and in generous portions--I had plenty left over for lunch the next day! 

The restaurant is always busy but has decent waitstaff and quick turnover on tables, so the wait won't be terrible most evenings. Oh and try the plum wine--it's delicious and a perfect complement to any dish ;-P

The only thing I didn't like at all was that, because the location is quite small, I could only find one unisex bathroom for the entire establishment! We sat on the left side of the restaurant (away from the nice bar and cute patio), so I didn't explore the entire place, but...a solo bathroom is definitely a tough situation for a bustling place like this. Thankfully I was told they are opening up in a larger location just down the road so that should take care of the bathroom thing.  Other than that it was a lovely dining experience and I look forward to trying more sushi and delicious entrees. Enjoy folks and keep eating local!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! My husband and I only live a 5 minute drive to this restaurant. We 
have gotten takeout at least once a month for the past year. Quality and quantity are always consistent and the food ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place on my way back from the mountains. I was craving Chinese and the reviews caught my attention. This place is DELICIOUS!!! 

First it was packed on a Wednesday night. Our server don't remember her name was very friendly and suggested we try a special dish called the Seafood Mala. We also ordered the chicken in red curry sauce something we were familiar with. Let me say this: her suggestion was better! He mala sauce was so amazing and tasted great with the fresh seafood they used. 

While this restaurant is far from where I am it is absolutely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Had the pepper steak and it was very good.  I had the hot and sour soup which is the best you'll get anywhere.  The staff is excellent."}
{"text":"Great place, had the sushi specialty roll.  Good beer menu, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Jia Asian Fusion is an adequate purveyor of Pan-Asian food and sushi, without any huge flaws but also without any particular standouts.

We got dinner here at around 7:30 on a Saturday night.  The place is certainly popular enough, so we endured a 15 minute wait for a table.  We started with a tempura appetizer, which comes with five pieces of tempura veggies and three shrimp.  The shrimp were good, though the tempura batter could have been a bit crispier.  The veggies were unremarkable (sweet potato, mushroom, zucchini, and red onion).  My biggest complaint here is that the slices of red onion had tough outer layers that should have been removed, as it made them more or less inedible.  The dipping sauce they came with, which was mostly soy, was good.

For our entrees, we split a bunch of sushi rolls.  We tried the Firebird roll (spicy salmon, avocado, tempura flake, topped with spicy tuna, tempura flake, lemon mayo sauce, basil flake, sesame seeds and micro green), which was the highlight of the meal.  Every component worked beautifully.  We also tried another specialty roll but I honestly can't remember which ones, but I remember it was tasty.  For our other three rolls we got spicy salmon, philly, and asparagus.  They were all tasty if not earth-shaking and the asparagus roll really surprised me with how good it was for being just asparagus.

I also ordered two pieces of salmon nigiri, and this was the biggest letdown of the night.  The salmon used for sushi is a fatty fish that should really melt in your mouth when you eat it, but this salmon was unfortunately very tough and unpleasant.  It was difficult to chew and a bit rubbery, which made it a challenge to eat.

Jia's drink menu was fine, if a bit limited on their draft beer selection, but they had an IPA I haven't tried before which I enjoyed so I won't ding them for that.  Service was rather slow, but our server was nice enough.

Our meal wasn't incredibly memorable, but prices were reasonable and it's not too far so I think we'll be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten sushi all over the world including Japan and this is my favorite. Ask for their special sushi menu for some extra unique flavors. 

The Chinese food here is far above any you will get elsewhere with all white breast chicken and other fresh ingredients. My favorite is simply the sesame chicken but I have them make it 4 star spicy. Also the Mongolian beef is far better than I have had elsewhere. 

The new location is great with way more space and a full service bar!  Ask the bartenders to make you one of their special drinks and you won't regret it. The Sake is also outstanding. We go here 1-2 times a week and have never been disappointed.

Continue to love this place. Tried their Pho soups, and loved them. Also the Seafood Mala is full of huge shrimp and great tasting scallops for those seafood lovers."}
{"text":"Been here two times. First time I had the sushi and I enjoyed it a lot. The second time I decided to order off the menu and was really disappointed. If I come back again sushi only."}
{"text":"It was pretty tasty and they were able to make any dish vegetarian for me.  Huge perk there!  I just thought the atmosphere needed some work.  It was bordering on a fast food atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best hot and sour soup, sushi and dishes. Derive is always great as well. This is one we eat at regularly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner tonight.  The place was standing room only.  Ordered a tiger roll and seaweed salad.  Some of the best sushi I've had in a long time.  Hoping my business brings me back this was so I can explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Fish was fresh and delicious. We had the Mango Salmon appetizer, Happy Roll, and Sashimi Dinner and loved it all. Beer selection is decent for a Japanese restaurant. My major complaint would be the number of rolls with fried or cooked elements because I love the fresh stuff. Can't believe I found this in a small town. Lots of people around us were going for the fusion food that evening."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and I have never been disappointed. The sweet & sour chicken is the best I have ever eaten, period. The pad Thai is also wonderful and the sushi rocks. This is among the very best in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Very good local place. Good ingredients, variety, great prices and a nice place for dine-in."}
{"text":"What a gem. And I'd of all places Gastonia
Super fresh and delicious   Can't go wrong on any of the choices!  Small and casual place in strip mall"}
{"text":"favorite place EVER for sushi! always great food, always great service, & the bartender, Bryson, is even more a amazing! not only can he make the good drinks on the menu but he has about 50 custom made drinks by him that's not on the menu! & they were honestly some of the best drinks i've ever tried. go check him out!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had! Love the owner and the wait staff are personable. They just moved to their new spot. We went Wednesday and it was superb. My friend has traveled extensively and he was very impressed especially by the Franklin Roll. I love the kanisu to start off with, the shrimp tempura roll with extra eel save and the shrimp and vegetables tempura.  Atmosphere is on point. I adore Jias! When we go as a family most of us order the scrumptious Mongolian beef. Everything is so delectable you just can't go wrong with any choice y ou make!"}
{"text":"Jia's expansion in their new location has made them bigger and better than ever! Good food, good sushi, and really nice looking restaurant. Even though they have expanded, there is still a wait on the weekends so go early!"}
{"text":"Jia has a new, larger building and the food is amazing.  The 3 times I've been there since they've moved we have had issues with service, once last night so bad I had to speak with the manager.

She cleared it up and got things rolling, and for that I was grateful.

The food is always delicious, prepared hot and fresh and packed with flavor.  I've seriously never had a bad dish here.  We love the sushi and the Tom Ka soup the best.  

If you visit, especially on Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait.  It is worth it, though."}
{"text":"Good tom kha thai soup but was missing a little heat (spice) in it. I loved their red curry chicken. Bf got the Mongolian delight & enjoyed it but I thought the curry was better. The restaurant is family friendly & not terribly expensive. Waitress was very friendly & helpful even on a busy night. I plan to go back & try the sushi."}
{"text":"My first time here...we came by late after a soggy day at Carowinds.   The service was exceptional, friendly and accommodating.  The miso soup was one of the best I've ever had!  Hibachi chicken w/brown rice was cooked to perfection-- stellar!!  I can't wait to come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! Beautifully presented and fresh! People are so nice and friendly, makes you feel right at home!"}
{"text":"This place is great ! Sushi was awesome and fresh ! The hot n sour soup was perfect ! Service was quick and pleasant ! Definitely recommend this place to all !"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Sushi was great,  Susan waited on us and she is a delight.  So thankful to have decent sushi place this close to home."}
{"text":"Super great sushi & nice wine & sake! 
Ask for the Duck, it's not on the menu but if they have it, it's exceptional! 
Fabulous presentation of cuisine"}
{"text":"A solid choice for sushi or asian fusion if you're willing to go a little out of your way. The restaurant was clean and there for a few customers inside for a late Sunday lunch. The staff are nice as well. We ordered a sashimi appetizer, and eel and avocado roll, and the fusion red chili snapper. Our sashimi consisted of salmon, \"white tuna\", maguro and imitation crab. When we saw the imitation crab it was a little disappointing because when ordering sashimi, you sincerely hope that your chef does not decide to give you imitation crab. The eel and avocado roll was good. I enjoyed our fusion red chili snapper dish. The sauce was delicious and the fish was fried perfectly. It also comes with a small bowl of rice. I would come back here to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food.  Sushi is different, tasty and made under watchful eyes. Peter was the sushi chef at Sakura in Gastonia.  This is his restaurant.  Follow him and come hungry!!!!  Ask him to surprise you.  I asked for a hand roll with eel and whatever else he knew would make me happy.  A party in my mouth.  A tad expensive as far as the sushi ones but you won't care and justify it. I will Yelp back with the review of the rest of the menu.  I am told the pad thai is good..... I will tell you if that is true.  Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Very casual pleasant atmosphere.   The most delicious sushi and Chinese food I have had in  a long time.  I have nothing to compare to in this area.   

Very friendly and courteous waiter (Ryan).  Very patient as we worked through the menu. 

For the quality of the food I thought the pricing was reasonable.  

Would definitely like to come back for the lunch specials. 

Thanks for doing restauranting well and way above average for Gaston County."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We walked in at 7:05 on a Saturday night and we were sat immediately. The place had a lot of customers but luckily they were on the ball with seating people. The hostesses were friendly and greeted us. After we were sat, our server greeted us and took our drink orders. I forget her name but she did a great job the whole night. I ordered the pineapple shrimp and it was delicious. I wish it had more shrimp, but I suppose what was given was reasonable. My wife had the chicken drunken noodles and they were great too. I think hers tasted better than mine. We also wanted to sample some sushi so we got the firebird roll and spicy shrimp roll. Both were amazing and had great flavor. As a bonus to all this, they had gluten free soy sauce. We don't have a gluten issue, but we think gluten free soy sauce taste 10 times better than regular soy sauce. Just a small added bonus. We will definitely be returning and can't wait to try more new things"}
{"text":"First time here, chose this for my birthday! We ordered various types of food, lettuce wraps, lo-mein, sushi, etc. everything was great and the service was even better! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We're from out of state visiting, and have eaten here twice in the last month in 2 difference visits.  
APPS- get the Spicy Mussels.  So unique and delish.  The Lettuce Wraps were equally good. 
SUSHI- Baja Roll is so refreshing and different with its Yuzu sauce
ENTREE- the Sesame Chicken was good quality and tasty.  

Great reasonable prices, friendly, and good service 

Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews BUT I have to say, if you are a sushi lover, this place IS IT! Ru Sans in Charlotte was my fav, until this place! I'm so glad I don't have to travel to Charlotte for great sushi! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Horrible lunch today. I had company from out of town who never got any refill even when asked, no pre bussing ANYTHING on the table. When I complained that my son's sweet and sour chicken was greasy, she said it's because they put the sauce on the side now and not on it. Meaning it's always been greasy and you just haven't been able to notice it and you obviously don't know that is what it is suppose to look like. Umm, no, grease isn't suppose to shine off your food or soak your fingers when you squeeze it. She was very short with me too a couple of times ordering. Can do without going back and their food and especially service has been going downhill as other reviewers have mentioned."}
{"text":"Very excited to have found this place. Went here last week and was very impressed by the food and service. Started with the crab rangoon and dynamite shrimp; both were good but a little extra spice to the shrimp would help it live up to its name. Thai coconut soup was the best I've ever had. Order the veggie and add chicken, you get a lot more vegetables that way. All the sushi we had was good as well. Great waitress and quick service even on a Friday evening when the place was pretty full. I've found my local go-to for my sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. By far the best sushi I have ever had. They're huge and delicious. Customer service was great. If I'm ever in the area I will definitely go back there"}
{"text":"Color me surprised! Looking for a place to eat on the way to the botanical gardens, I didn't have high hopes (sorry, Gastonia). Of the options we thought sushi would be the best, and the few reviews helped us single out Jia. Well, I'm so glad we stopped in!

We walked in and the special roll was based around chilean sea bass - well that's new for me! Looking at the menu, the salmon mango salad spoke to us - mostly because it actually said \"A MUST HAVE!\", so we fell for it and also ordered the \"Jia\" lettuce wraps. Moments later they both arrived. Seriously, the salmon mango salad really is what they say it is, so order it! So delicious. Once you get over that they served you an actual wedge of iceberg for the wraps and not just the nice outer pieces, you're going to love it too. As almost off-put as I was as soon as they put it down, I realized the smaller pieces actually worked in our favor for smaller bites, and the chicken mix is perfectly seasoned. 

We ordered two rolls for entrees, the mango tango roll (might as well keep with the mango theme) and the yummy(?) roll. The mango roll was HUGE. It was only nine pieces, but they were very large pieces, and pretty good flavors too. The second roll was also good, but didn't stand out as much as the first, and was also more normal sized.

Our server was great, the food came out pretty fast (almost too little time passed between appetizer and entrees), I definitely look forward to eating here again. The only thing that seemed weird was some of their beers, a decent amount of high gravity and heavier ones that didn't really seem to match up with eating sushi, but maybe I'm not aware of this pairing."}
{"text":"Super high quality Sushi! Came here and tried the spicy tuna, white tuna, and mango salmon! The white tuna was a little odd, but that's personal preference. The spicy tuna was FABULOUS! They have super good prices for lunch. We did the 3 rolls for $12! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I sat @ Sushi Bar & had the eel, Fireball Roll, & Dragon Roll. All very good, fresh w/ right amount of spice. The service was nothing special, a little slow. I gave it a four because food."}
{"text":"Jia's food is mediocre. The sushi is just ok. The egg rolls taste like sam's club egg rolls. I know a lot of people love the place, but having been there four times. I find myself feeling like I could've gotten better food at a lot of the fast food Chinese places in the area."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before until trying to find dinner to celebrate an anniversary. I saw the solid reviews and thought to give it a try. I'm really glad I did. Our visit was on a Sunday night about 7:45pm. We were seated in the back but unfortunately had to wait about five minutes before our waitress came by for our drink order. After drinks came around we ordered the crunchy tuna roll for an appetizer, I ordered the bibimbap and my husband ordered the triple broccoli crown. The wait time for our appetizer was about 30-35 minutes. I was pretty upset about it. After the first 10 minutes of waiting our waitress came by, apologized and stated we would have to wait a little longer. I thought maybe another 10 minutes...but then another 10 rolled by, realized how long we waited total, and was ready to rip this place apart on Yelp and vow never to return. Finally the appetizer makes its way to our table. Trust me when I say that crunchy tuna roll saved the day. IT WAS OUTSTANDING! My husband and I devoured it in probably less than a minute. It was deep fried on the outside, tuna on the inside was cooked to a perfect medium, and had some type of soy sauce it was sitting in that I just could not get enough of. I had poured soy sauce in the little dish to dip it in before it arrived. It was so well seasoned it never touched the soy sauce I poured. If I can recommend a sushi roll that will please everyone, pick that one. I will probably order three of them next time I return.

Our main entrees arrived about 10 minutes after our appetizer, so luckily no additional wait for the rest of the night. I had never had bibimbap before so I thought I would try it. It was absolutely delicious and EXTREMELY filling. It was beef with chopped veggies (I'm pretty sure it was zucchini and Japanese eggplant) and fresh scallions all served over steamed white rice in a hot pot. The hot pot was so well insulated even as I was finishing the last bit I was still blowing air on the food so I wouldn't burn my mouth. My husband loved the triple broccoli crown. There was a lot of meat to the dish and the rice was served on the side.

The wait time on the appetizer is the only reason I'm not giving this place a perfect review. The food was absolutely fantastic so I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very good service and delicious food.  Sushi is yummy and they cater to shellfish allergies!"}
{"text":"We have tried it about 5 times and the food is okay but the staff seems to gather together and not pay 100% to the patron. We have had to get up to get the waitress or waiter attention for tea or additional condiment that should be just as attentive as we are paying consumers. 

Food is okay but truly nothing to write home about or even special as it should be.  I'm just hoping they do improve as we like the place but maybe with time?"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the newer, larger location a few times as of this review. The best part of that is shorter wait times. This place is pretty popular and people are always coming in to eat. This is a great place to have a meal with someone who doesn't eat sushi, because the regular food menu is extensive.

If you come here for sushi rolls, be sure to ask for the special roll book, it's an additional three pages of rolls to choose from. My friend and I chose 3 rolls from the list plus the special roll written on the board out front. When it's busy the wait for your rolls may be noticeable, but when they come out, absolutely delicious.

I'm a fan of the new full bar, and never miss an opportunity to order a cocktail with dinner. I will continue to return."}
