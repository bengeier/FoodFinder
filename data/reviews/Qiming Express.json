{"text":"Not the fanciest but definitely delicious. Had the Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, comes with delicious wonton soup and a roll for $9 Overall very yummy and affordable"}
{"text":"My friends and I have ordered from here three times now and the food and service has always been great. We really appreciate how fresh the vegetables are. The quality of the meat in the dishes has also been very good. We keep coming back because the food is never too greasy and we like the combination of spices used. One time the shrimp and vegetable dish was so exceptional with its soothing, light broth. I don't know if they always make it like that. We might have been lucky.   I can recommend the Singapore noodles and szechuan shrimp dishes. The egg rolls are very small so you might want to just stick with the main dishes for value."}
{"text":"The Cantonese chow mein had hard noodles and was just too saucy. The dumplings weren't great either."}
