{"text":"Great food and very fresh. My favorite is ginger chicken with jasmine rice. Great service. Worth trying."}
{"text":"Great Thai dishes!!  Their seafood coconut soup is one of the best I've ever had (although they have been putting less and less seafood in) and both standard and country Pad Thai are perfect.  Curry dishes were very good as was the duck dish I had.  Satay was great, especially the beef.   They also have one of the best Thai Ice Teas as well.  I've had Thai food in all the major cities including San Fran, New York, Chicago, Honolulu HI, Washington DC and this rivals them all.  Word of warning however.  Twice we have gone with friends who are not Thai food lovers and they ordered typical Chinese dishes that ARE on the menu and both times they thought it was only fair at best so they did not like it.  Stick to what they know and that's Thai food.  Pad Thai the way it is SUPPOSED to be, not the typical overly oily or worse soy sauce ridden dishes you see elsewhere.  Please support this local spot and keep it open!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out on a Tuesday at 7pm and ready at 7:10.  Miso soup had lots of Tofu, seaweed and flavor.  Pineapple fried rice had plenty of shrimp and chicken, pineapple and raisins and included veggies.  All tasted very good.  The dish didn't have much spice but that can sometimes mask the true flavor anyway.  Portions great and value too!  I travel for business throughout Midwest but would recommend Spice Thai Cuisine since I used Yelp myself to find it.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Spice Thai three times and it's been amazingly delicious and affordable!   We highly recco that EVERYONE try this place to support our local businesses.  PS - if you like spicy food, but don't like it too hot...order at the #2 level!  :)"}
{"text":"Some of the best Pad Thai I have ever had.   Country style is wonderful - however they serve it sans tofu.....BOOO!!!  Generally, not crowded at lunch.  Meal comes with complimentary soup of the day which can be hit or miss.   So disappointed they no longer carry flavored bubble tea's - BRING back the Taro bubble tea!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times and I have been impressed by the fresh ingredients and fast service each time. The staff is friendly and efficient and the food is as good as any Thai restaurant in the area. I hope it's around for a long time."}
{"text":"Love the noodle soup best I've ever had in was pleasantly surprised on the service we got right in and people were extremely kind.  I would highly recommend it to some one who enjoys Thai food and doesn't care to wait 15 min for food"}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been here twice in the past 3 weeks. The food is outstanding!  We found out they are under new management. We will be back very soon. Keep up the great cooking, wonderful flavors with the fresh ingredients! Best of all, if you want it a little hotter or a little cooler, they can do that too."}
{"text":"I've been at Spice Thai a few times now and the food has been consistently great. I love Thai curries and Spice's are always flavorful and have just the right amount of heat when requested.  Friends and family have enjoyed the noodle dishes and loved them as well.   I definitely recommend this place for great Thai food in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I have dined in 3 times (once with my in laws) and ordered take out twice. We have had nothing but positive, wonderful experiences every time!  The staff is always super friendly and service is always great! The food is amazing every time! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Went to Spice Thai for lunch today. We came in at the last part of lunch rush. All the tables were either occupied or covered in dirty dishes except one. Only one waitress who greeted us nicely and dropped off menus. She was doing the best she could under the circumstances. A busboy would have been a great help to her but it's a small operation and I imagine they need to keep costs down.  My wife and I had steamed pork dumplings and chicken satay along with chicken lo mein and shrimp and chicken fried rice.  The food is what you would expect to see in an Asian buffet. I ended up vomiting the meal as soon as we returned home. I normally have a cast iron stomach.  We tried this restaurant a couple years ago and based on the recent reviews we decided to revisit as it sounded like they'd improved. They haven't."}
{"text":"Amazing! We love this place. Lots of vegetarian options. The Tom Yum Noodle soup is so good!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, hot and fast food. Spouse says it was tasty, perfect cooked chicken in crispy pad Thai. And plenty of it. Worth a try."}
{"text":"I went to this place on suggestion from few friends, we really liked the food. Crazy noodles was good, so is pineapple chicken. I would go back for sure and recommend it to others"}
{"text":"I ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp and chicken and it may have been the best pad Thai I've had. I ordered carry out and it was ready in about 15 minutes - very quick and easy for a work night. The location is super convenient since it's right off the highway. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Twinsburg! We were a little concerned when we walked in and didn't see many patrons. However, our orders of crazy noodles and crispy pad Thai are worth the trip. Friendly and attentive service from the waitress as well. We will definitely be back soon and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. Went there for a Saturday night dinner with kids. Place was empty but yet pathetic service. This is a 2 man operation, one cooks and the other waits. My daughter made mistake of not saying no shrimp in her pad Thai. When the food came, they refused to remake it unless I paid for this dish. Never had that experience before. You ask for extra cutlery and paper napkins, you get exactly one of each. It was not like the food was great either. My ginger chicken was bitter, the pad Thai was undercooked and way too sweet. $15 entree too, very expensive for this quality and service. Sorry but I will never go bck there again."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. A hidden gem in twinsburg.  Will be going back many more times. Good size menu with great variety. Would recomend to anyone who likes Thai cuisine or is looking for a chnge from the same old Chinese dishes that flood the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their curries. They're definitely better than anything else we have locally"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place opened. We desperately needed a Thai place in Twinsburg.   I've lived in many cities and have had Thai cuisine everywhere. This place is right up there with the best. So far I've been there twice and both times they did a great job. The first time we had Country Style Pad Thai, Green Curry, and the dumplings as an appetizer. Everything was very good. I learned that their \"spicy\" was not really that hot so the next time I went I asked for 2-1/2 stars on the spiciness. The second time we got the masaman curry and the wild boar basil. The wild boar basil was fantastic, I didn't have much of the masaman.  The wait staff is made up of a couple of adorable Thai girls that are very attentive and kind of shy, which I love. They don't speak English all that well but always get the orders right and your water is always filled. The jasmine tea was good too.   Now for the bad: no liquor license yet, and the place was sorta empty both times I went in. The liquor license is coming shortly according to the waitress. The place being empty scares me because I want this place to flourish in the worst way.   To sum it up... Go there. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with my father just before a medical appointment. Even though we told the wait staff that we were in a hurry, the service was slow. To be fair to her, she appeared to be working alone, covering greeting & seating, taking orders, answering the phone for takeout orders, and serving by herself until another employee arrived about 1/2 hour after we were seated.  Our food was very good when it did arrive. We each had a bowl of Tom Yum Goong, and we split an order of chicken cashew.  It was all fresh and light and flavorful, as good Thai food should be."}
{"text":"Food was good.  My wife and I went there for dinner and the place was an absolute ghost town.  I mean literally at 5pm on a Friday we were it.  Service was good, food was good.  Definitely not the best Thai I have ever had but it is quite acceptable for this area."}
{"text":"STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!  We should've taken it as a sign that this place was completely dead on a Friday night.   We ordered the crispy pad thai and the massaman seafood curry. The noodles were \"crispy\" alright...they were not even cooked! We kindly asked the hostess to exchange our crispy pad thai for regular pad thai. She returned less than 5 minutes later and tossed the takeout container to us like we were animals! The hostess unwillingly provided a refund after we shared how terrible the customer service was. I will NOT return."}
{"text":"I was excited when I read some of the reviews, but this place just didn't do it for me.  The service was great, however the food was very mediocre.  What really bothered me the most though was the bathroom.  It felt sticky and dirty, like it just needed a good scrubbing.  I can't handle stuff like that so I won't be going back.  The whole place needs to be painted and scrubbed down."}
{"text":"I have been going here with my wife since it opened.  It was good, and close by, but not outstanding, and really took a dive recently.  They closed for a week or two in November, and they are now open again under new management.  The new owners are experienced with a first restaurant in the Coventry area.  Our first visit was good (Some of the best soup I have had) - I'm looking forward to seeing how it matures."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service needs some help. I would order take out until they can get their inside service corrected. Not real busy but orders took a while to get. It was great when I got it!"}
{"text":"I'm always excited for Thai food and the staff were very nice. I had ordered their drunken noodles and Tom Yum soup which were tasty. I would have given this place 4 stars for being your typical, decent Thai place for food and service as what you may come to expect from a local Thai restaurant catering to a somewhat non-native demographic, but I unfortunately think this place upset my stomach and my husband believed it had upset his the first time.  The restaurant did seem clean, however and we have only been here twice... so personally, I'm wary of coming here again but the verdict is still out..."}
{"text":"First time here today. Ordered Pad Thai, and soup. Delicious. Nice restaurant , with nice, polite staff, and good lunch prices. Lunch menu has a nice selection with reasonable prices. Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Nice staff and the Country Pad Thai was perfectly spicy with lots of white meat and large shrimp. I got it to go and it was still hot back at the office. The only think missing was fresh lime juice - I don't know if it's served tableside but it needed that kick of acid. Chicken Satay app was nothing special I'm afraid, sauces let it down there."}
{"text":"I was really hoping this place would be great, but sadly... It wasn't. I ordered the Shumai and the Crazy Noodle. First, the Shumai were store bought. No kidding, they're the same ones you can buy in the frozen section of a Giant Eagle. Don't get me wrong... They are tasty, but when I go to a restaurant, I expect homemade or at the very least a frozen version of something I can't buy myself. The Crazy Noodle was okay at best. I wanted Pad See Ew, but it was not on the menu. At the suggestion of the nice waiter, I tried the Crazy Noodle. It wasn't horrible, but all it really tasted like was spicy star anise. Overall, I was severely disappointed."}
{"text":"Must be new ownership, or at least new management. Prices got raised, service worse, but at least the food quality and taste is still good. However, I feel it's no longer worth the price. We're now going to Akira in Solon, mainly for sushi (and much better service and pricing."}
{"text":"The food receives an \"A\" for adequate Tai food.  The facility is not well equipped to handle large groups.  We arrived with a large group and only one waitress was available.  She served a table that was sat down before us and the service was very slow. They also did not provide Straws."}
{"text":"Awesome little suburban sprawl Thai, red curry is fantastic, would recommend add mushrooms and no carrots. I'm amazed at the temperature the food must be packed at, it's like molten lava when we get home, which is perfect because slightly warm Thai food gets meh'd. The chicken coconut soup is my favorite I've ever had, really on point and so much flavor."}
{"text":"I was staying at a local hotel and ordered takeout. I walked into the restaurant late on a Tuesday night and there were no customers, so I was a bit concerned about the food quality. But the two dishes I ordered were crazy good. The pad Thai country style was some of the best Pad Thai I've ever had and the green curry with chicken was outstanding. Portions were huge. Just finished the leftovers and had to submit the review. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fist time here. Went with coworkers for lunch. The place is bigger than I thought. The service was very good and so was the food. The soup was very light and tasty. I ordered the chicken and shrimp mango delight. Not a heavy oil feel/taste either; which I liked. Although you only get three shrimp and not a lot of chicken the food was still very good and so was the presentation. I will definitely go back and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Solon/Twinsburg/Hudson area. Very authentic. Don't hesitate to ask for \"Thai spicy\" which is the real deal non-Americanized fake."}
{"text":"Every time my wife and I have been here the food has been amazing, and the staff has been super friendly!  I particularity love the curry dishes, Tom Yum noodle soup, and the Crazy Noodle."}
{"text":"The good: the restaurant seemed clean and nice, our server was friendly. The salad was good, as was my Thai tea. Also quick seating, although the place was pretty empty at lunch time. Not a good sign.  The bad: We went here for lunch. My daughter ordered the bubble tea. The tapioca in the tea was hard as a rock. We then ordered the calamari appetizer. The batter was flavorless and the calamari tasted old (freezer burn?) For lunch we ordered Pad Thai and Masaman curry. When our lunch arrived we immediately noticed a foul odor. I leaned forward to smell it and gagged. Something was not right, rotten or spoiled with the pad Thai. My daughter lost her appetite after smelling it.   The ugly: My husband said that's enough- and went to talk to the manager (?) who was an older American lady.  He explained that we were having a bad experience with the food and would like to pay for what we ate and leave. She told him she could offer him a free meal coupon for our next return. Umm, we will not be coming back. She then gave him a bill for the entire meal, including the foul pad Thai. We paid, left and regret ever coming here.  We have eaten Thai food all over the U.S. and this was by far the worst, ever. The poor customer service didn't help matters either."}
{"text":"I love supporting small, family owned businesses. I must say, definitely impressed me. I ordered the country pad Thai and it was delicious. The place is clean and the food is good, that does it for me. So happy to have found a new place to frequent and support!"}
{"text":"Not terrible, but nothing to write home about. Ordered the pad Thai and it was ready very quickly, only contained 2 shrimp though (enough to make it plural on the menu, I suppose haha). I think there's probably better menu items, but I was in a hurry and ordered without exploring through all the selections.   Overall, nice if you're in a hurry and want something outside traditional chain restaurants, but if you're specifically seeking Thai food, I would search for other options."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food.everything as ordered. I went a little crazy on this order. Chicken satay, spring rolls, Tom yum shrimp soup, pad Thai and spicy basil chicken fried rice. It was all delicious and authentic. Flavors and portions were right and delicious. Courteous staff and only a 15 min wait for take out. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Sadly, this place is under new management and is rather poorly run. The wait staff seems uninterested and several people came in and had to wait a couple minutes before anyone noticed them.   I've been here several times since it reopened so I waited to post this hoping it would get better.  It didn't.  Although the food is still decent the service leaves a lot to be desired.  Chris"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here on 06/29/2014 after reading reviews. The place was empty when we got there. Food was hot and fresh. Love the Crab Rangoon. Ordered the Crispy Pad Thai and while it didn't taste bad, I should have ordered it the regular way. Will order from there again but only takeout as most of the reviews I read talk about horrible dine-in service. I don't want to experience that so takeout it is! If you are in the Twinsburg area or are close, drop in. You won't be disappointed....In the food anyway."}
{"text":"Awful, awful food.  We normally go to Thai Gourmet on Graham and Darrow, and absolutely love it. We thought we would try something new, and were nearby, so we stopped here instead.  Let's start with the positives: friendly service, so-so decor, acceptable appetizers.  After the appetizers, we still had our hopes up. But as soon as the server set down the plate of Pad Thai in front of me, this terrible smell hit my nose. I waited for my girlfriend to try her Ginger Chicken dish. After one bite she had this disgusted look on her face, and said \"This is horrible!\" I thought she was joking, there was no way it was that bad, but as I put my fork into the Pad Thai, it was like scooping up a clump of slime. I took a bite of it and got completely disgusted. It did not taste anything like Pad Thai - just bland, nasty slime. I could only force down a few bites.  She thinks the Ginger Chicken was bought ready-made and just microwaved, and I have to agree, it had the taste of frozen food. It was still better than mine (which is not saying much), so after she had a few bites, I had some of hers. She really wanted to say something to the staff, but we held back. We quickly boxed it up, paid the bill and left. We've never thrown out leftovers before, but there's a first for everything.   They have to know how bad the food is, yet they serve it to you with a smile. If this was a cheap $5 all-you-can-eat buffet, I could understand it being this bad.  Save yourself the money and drive down Darrow Rd to Pad Thai. Or even better, go further south down Darrow Rd to Thai Gourmet, which easily has the best food, service, and decor in the area."}
{"text":"We had seen this place while driving on 91 and decided to give it a shot. I LOVE Thai food (the week before this I ate at Palm Thai in Madison, NJ, which was superb), and the prospect of a good Thai place right here in Twinsburg was intriguing. But there was so much wrong...where to start? The sweet and sour chicken was inedibly dry, which was odd because it was covered in sauce. The spring rolls tasted like they came straight from a package (I swear I've had the same ones from Aldi's), and the duck sauce was watery. I ordered a side of jasmine rice and got plain steamed white rice, and ordered plain lo mein noodles for the kids and got noodles mixed with vegetables. The basil fried rice was heavy and greasy, with the basil lending very little flavor. We dropped over $50 here and it's one of those times I wish I could just get my money back and forget it ever happened. At least now we know."}
{"text":"Poor food and flavor. The chicken was over cooked and the noodles were all clumped together. Only positive thing is that the food came out quick! I will never visit this place again and neither should anyone else."}
{"text":"Great dinner after the festivities for Friday's night TwinsDays.  Only us and another two friends Eating there. Great food"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot and maybe dinner.  All the food I have had has been good.  I love the basil fried rice.  The free soup is really nice."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at Spice Thai. Pulling up to the strip mall in Twinsburg, the outside is not nearly as telling as the quality of their cuisine!  Holy guacamole, huge portions! My Mom and I ordered two appetizers thinking they would be small. But the seaweed salad alone is big enough for two! The scallion pancake also had the most delish sweet sauce for dipping in, and our service was incredibly fast. The green curry with chicken was literally the perfect blend of spicy, giving that \"kick\" I was looking for with my meal. The vegetables were very fresh and colorful. Yet again, this portion was so large I took nearly half of it home...and it made the best leftovers.  While the restaurant was somewhat quiet, the phone did not stop buzzing! They seem to run quite the goldmine on takeout. Looking forward to trying their crunchy pad thai on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Overall: For my takeout, the food was hit-and-miss.  I'll probably be back to try a different dish.  There aren't many Thai options in the area.  Food: 3 stars.  Pad see ew was bland and below average.  I'd prefer they use Chinese broccoli (kai-lan or gai-lan) instead of mushy regular broccoli.  The good news is there was a lot of it, so you'll definitely get 2 bland meals.  The Tom Kha was very good.  Spring rolls were average.  Prices: 4 stars.  Very reasonable, especially considering the other Thai places overcharge.  Pad see ew was $10, Tom Kha was $4 and spring rolls were $5.  Service (takeout only): 4 stars.  They had the meal done on time, and the employee seemed nice enough.  Appearance: 3 stars.  It's fine.  It's not unique but it's adequate."}
{"text":"First experience with takeout here was not too bad.   Got the crispy pad thai & the country pad thai~ Very good.   It was fresh & a decent portion size for the cost.   Also ordered the tempura veggies.   That was a dissapointment!   Very small portion for the price & for what it was, soggy & mostly carrot & onion~Unimpressed.    Decided to go back last night for another try & ordered the crispy pad thai again, the ground pork pad ka prow & crispy spring rolls.   WHAT A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY!!  The crispy pad thai this time was basically a tiny pkg of broken up Ramon noodles with \"3\" lousy shrimp & a few pieces of bland chicken.   It was grossly runny as well, considering the name C-R-I-S-P-Y ~Disgusting!  NEXT,  The pad ka prow was the worst excuse for a $14. 00 dish. It was literally nothing more than a scoop of ground pork & onion swimming in a pool of brothy water~About to cry at this point.  Lastly, of all things,  the spring roll was a rubbery crab stick rolled in a spring roll wrapper~ HUH??   I really wanted to love this place.   It's very nice inside & seemed to produce very appetizing dishes from the kitchen to the table both times that I was there.  However,  their takeout is inconsistent & lacks any degree of pride.  I gave them 2 stars for cleanliness & a pleasing dining room.   Sadly,  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"3/10/18 Country Pad Thai medium spice will kick your butt with awesome flavor. This is some of my favorite Pad Thai anywhere. The peanuts and peppers are so so integrated into the dish you can barely see them. It's not spoiled with a bunch of vegetables to try to put some modern flair into the dish. Just full of delicious flavor. The dumplings are very good as well. Only downside is the atmosphere. Only a table or two has customers typically."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Thoe was so sweet and helpful. We came with a party of 12 for the twins day festival.  She was great to guide us with our choices  and the food was delicious.   Tom yum and Tom kha was so good I'm still dreaming about it. Curry dishes amazing too. Order brown rice for a healthy option too. Love this place. Coming back next year !!!"}
{"text":"When we walked in there was no one in the place ... Which made me worry... Buutttt The appetizers were amazing as well as our dinner!!! I would highly recommend! Not sure why the place wasn't packed!!"}
{"text":"Quick service but the pad Thai was overly sweet. The summer rolls were fresh and crisp but tiny."}
{"text":"Food is decent but this place is DISHONEST!  By dishonest, I mean check your receipt AND your credit card statement if you do decide to eat here!  We ate here a short time ago and the food was decent and well prepared but I've had better Thai food in my other reviews.  When a group of us were finished I paid and gave tip with a credit card all on one receipt.   It was in writing with a set amount!  Well, when I received m credit card statement I noticed they charged a few dollars more than what was the original amount on the receipt!  I don't care if it's just a few dollars or even a few cents that is DISHONEST and STEALING!  I will not be returning here.  So, for anyone who does eat here and pay with a credit card get a copy of your receipt (WITH TIP WRITTEN ON IT like I did) and check your statement."}
{"text":"Hey guys! If you never been in Thai and have no idea what the Thai cuisine should look like then you could visit them. They gave me BREADED tofu! Breaded, Karl!! Like regular chicken fingers in MCDonalds... Crispy duck means breaded duck instead of regular Asian cooking way!  Its not Thai restaurant and cuisine! Its the restaraunt where guys think that they know how the Thai food should taste. Terrible terrible terrible! Never do that!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Service was good. Good overall was excellent! Got the Tom Yum Noodle soup with seafood and it was delicious. Others got various fried rice and all of which turned out great. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I come here for take out all the time for lunch, and have always been very happy with the service, and the food. The Indonesian Fried Rice, Panaang curry, and Green curry are delish. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious: Shumai, hot basil dish. Jasmine tea. Many choices from not spicy to very hot.  Nice ambiance  Waiter very friendly & helpful.  We will return."}
{"text":"Pretty good! We got take out so I cannot comment on the atmosphere but the food was good! I had the spicy thai green curry with chicken with brown rice - vegetables were fresh and the curry was very flavorful!"}
{"text":"We had a top notch experience at Spice Thai on a chill Saturday night.  While Panini's was slammed, Spice Thai was not.  We gladly accepted this.  The restaurant was quiet and mostly desolate except for another table and take out orders.  That's a scary sign but thankfully we roughed it out and got some top notch Thai.  We started with shrimp spring rolls and went on to soup.  The Miso Soup was much better than anything you will find at Japanese places, and the Kimchi soup was amazing, and hot!  We prefer spice and heat, so you can select your level of hotness.  My basil chicken was sooo good because it was fried chicken, with basil, and peppers.  The Pad Thai was also some of the best we've had.  And best yet we had food to take home for the next day."}
{"text":"My mom introduced me to this place and I love it. The mango wings (or anything with mango) are always amazing. Anytime I go, I also order the beef bi bim bab."}
{"text":"There was only one other guy in the whole restaurant and two other people stopped to get food to go. The pad Thai was okay. It had two shrimp in it. They should have just made it chicken. A small salad came out in advance. It looked like it had been been prepared a while ago so I didn't eat it."}
{"text":"I order from here at least once a month. I've had their Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Tom Kha, Mango Sticky rice, and Satay and everything has been great and they serve generous portions. I've always gotten my orders to go but the restaurant always seems clean and the staff is friendly. I would recommend Spice Thai."}
