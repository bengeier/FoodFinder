{"text":"This place is truly an insult to Caribbean cuisine... Let me start with the good - located in a prime location parking is within walking distance.  The bad calling themselves a Caribbean fusion restaurant. The rice and peas were undercooked and loaded with coconut milk and sugar. Please do yourself a favour and skip the macaroni pie. This disgusting concoction had no flavour and they had the audacity to add coconut milk and garnish it with shavings. This ingredient should never be added to this dish. If you like pepper shrimp then stay clear of this place. We were served with prawns that weren't properly cleaned and the sauce was disgusting. The jerk pork and chicken were under seasoned. Jerk is a blend of herbs and spices, how can you mess this up? The meat was obviously not marinated long enough. The texture of the chicken was dry and couldn't detect the seasoning in the pork.   The ugly - from first glance the restaurants decor looks inviting, but please look more closely. When was the last time they mopped this place? Look under the table, there is dirt caked onto the stands. By accident we saw a sneak peak of the kitchen. This place needs a health check immediately.   Overall, this restaurant is over priced and the food is underwhelming. I suggest the owner take the cooking staff on a tour of west Indian restaurants and learn how to cook all over again. Let me suggest Rum Diaries, Beryl's Pepperpot, Cravings, etc. In the meantime, save your money Torontonians!!!"}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to love this place.  I really enjoy Dirty Bird and was excited that they had another restaurant opening.  I had read the Toronto star and Blog TO articles so when my partner and I were in the area last week I suggested going.    The one thing I have to admit is the decor is amazing.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  As others have mentioned the music is way too loud.  Several occasions I saw the staff having to run outside to take phone orders because they couldn't hear anything either.  The service is extremely confusing- not only as patrons but also to the staff.  You're given a card that you complete (similar to dim sum) and you bring it up to the cash and place your order and pay.  The problem was in the follow through.  They seemed to have forgotten us as tables who placed their orders after us received their food.  They also asked us several times if we had paid and what we had ordered.  They offered us a free beer but I don't drink beer and my partner just wanted his Ting that he had paid for but took forever to arrive.  After we got half the order we realized that staff forgot to place half of our order even though it was clearly marked on the card.  We obviously paid for those items and there wasn't an offer for a discount  even though we turned down the free drinks earlier.  The food was the biggest let down and most concerning.  The rice is expensive at 3.99 for a tiny bowl that is half full and it just isn't pleasant to eat- it tastes stale and is overpowered with coconut.  The oxtail was ok- nothing special but decent.    The biggest problems were the pepper shrimp and the jerk chicken.  Both were undercooked!!  Because I usually don't want to make up a big scene I didn't say anything about the shrimp.  We ordered a lot of food so we ended up taking a lot of the jerk chicken home with us.  We didn't realize the chicken was undercooked until my partner took a bite out of it a day later.  The photo speaks for itself.  He was ill the following day as well.    We will not be going back and I would not recommend this restaurant until they get their act together."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my family. It was the worst meal that I had especially for the the $90 I spent. I could have made a better dinner at home. The concept of the restaurant is really nice but they have to find another cool. Awful!!! I would not go back."}
{"text":"Girl at the cash barely had a clue what was going on. Had to ask for drinks multiple times. Oxtail was pretty shit. Mostly beans. Had like 4 tinys pieces of meat. And i paid for the 1lb order. Dont know how that happened. Jerk chicken came out bone dry. Boring flavour. Really sad for a Caribbean restaurant. Rice and peas was pretty shit too if im being honest. The mac n cheese was pretty good though, probably the only thing id go back for if i was to go back. Thats a big if."}
{"text":"I sorry to say this was not Jamaican food. It was dried chicken with some sort of spicy sauce. The location is great and the staff were very nice. The seating area was clean and comfortable. But no authentic jerk chicken or stew chicken, Even the plantain was dried out when it should be fried, ripe, & juicy. Com'on Joel you can do this better!"}
{"text":"I look at food/drink, price and service when evaluating establishments. That being said, AF1's rating that I gave is propped up due to their wonderful and attentive service. Unfortunately, they dropped the ball in the other categories.   Here was my journey:  Entering- the smell of their food is amazing! Truly great and the decor really elevated my expectations of what was to come. You can tell the owner(s) care about their image and are trying to bring Caribbean food to the forefront of choice.   Food - my girlfriend and I ordered jerk chicken, curry goat, rice and peas and plantain. As a side mention, we originally wanted ox tail but they were out of it so we settled for the curry goat. Although the food was presented nicely it all lacked something.   CURRY GOAT: was tough and the flavour was missing that good Jamaican curry flavour we are accustomed to.   JERK CHICKEN: was okay but seemed to be one you can buy at the grocery store. It wasn't that great tasting.   RICE AND PEAS: for some reason tasted like sweet coconut rice. It was pretty terrible.   PLANTAIN: they were okay.   COLESLAW: the slaw served on the side was more vinegar based and was rather basic.   Honourable mention  JERK PORK: we were served jerked pork accidentally which was given for free after the error. It had the right flavour but the meat was tough as well and just wasn't that good.   WHITE RICE: didn't have that when asked.    Drink- my girlfriend wanted the rum punch but they unfortunately ran out of that and she settled for water.  For me, I was pretty happy here because they had one of my favourite beers, dragon stout.   Price- the price wasn't too bad considering the area but in terms of quality I was a little disappointed. The price  didn't reflect the quality that would be expected with such a dollar figure.   Service- this was the best part of the experience and is why I will try going again to see if the product quality and value changes."}
{"text":"Terrible front of house staff - rude and indifferent. Slowest service, with pretty bad food too. Just waited about 25 mins for a take out jerk pork with slaw and bread. I got jerk pork with rice, no slaw or bread."}
{"text":"Despite the bad reviews here, I decided to stop in for lunch because one of their lunch specials seemed as though it might be good.   The place is nice and my oxtail gnocchi was good... Not great, but pretty good for a grand total of $9, including tip. See picture.  The one thing that is brutal though is the service. I guess that it's somewhat friendly, but here is how my visit went down...  - I walk in not knowing whether to seat myself or order from the counter... What kind of restaurant is this? I can't tell. - The server is staring right at me for about a minute, not saying anything. I'm not sure if he noticed that I was confused (?) - I finally ask him, \"So, how does this work?\". He finally tells me that I can sit down. - After looking at the menu, I had to wave him over to take my order. Please note that I was the only person in the restaurant at this point. - Food came quickly. Yay! - While I'm eating my food, he asks if I would like some water, I say YES, he walks back to the kitchen... And I literally never see him again. I am one of two people in the restaurant at this point. - When I finish eating, I wait for someone to give me the bill. No one. I go to the counter and pay for my meal and I think it's the chef that is taking my money.  It was all pretty funny, so I wasn't mad. But wow."}
{"text":"I really want this place to thrive but issa no for me dawg. Lemme break down the experience:  1.Service was horrible. We has to repeatedly ask where are food was and they kept forgetting things in our order.   2.You can tell the food was not fresh , it was pre heated then served. Most of the dishes had huge  coconut shavings on top ... WHY??  3. The mac pie is NOT  a pie its a Mac and Cheese that also has coconut shavings on top... WHY?  4. My friend ordered the oxtail and rice and peas. The rice came in a tea cup saucer size plate and the oxtail ( that looked like beef stroganoff in a can) came on a huge plate with two pieces of meat. Did I mention that the rice had huge coconut shavings on it.   5. The jerk chicken tasted like chicken with Diana Sauce and they has two pieces of Wonder bread on the plate. No coconut shavings on this one.   6. As we were suffering though our tasteless meal ( and being there for about 25 min, the waiter asks if were OK... Boy bye!  7. Don't get the rum cake.   This place needs a Gordon Ramsay Kitchen Nightmares intervention of realness.   Oh the decor was nice tho."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. Prior to their grand opening, all of the marketing and build up got me excited, but ultimately the food was a disappointment.   I took my fiance here for a quick bit to eat on a Saturday afternoon. The front of house staff was super friendly and welcoming.   We ordered the food, was not a lot of meat (mostly gravy) which was disappointing. Moreover my meal did not include rice & peas (which is a delicious staple in a lot of Caribbean dishes).   Our meat dish came with hard dough bread (often called 'hardo bread') if you're of Caribbean background you will know what I mean. The bread was so-so."}
{"text":"At first glance, this place looks like a chilled out spot for some Carribean food. Looks are deceiving.   Three of us had dinner here last night because we just happened to be in the area and our first choice restaurant was closed.   We ordered waters and a coke. That alone took about 20 minutes to get to our table. If there was any ice in the water, it must have melted long before because i drank some room temperature water out of desperation.   When we finally got our food, it was all just... A mess. We got a beef patty, a few orders of rice and peas, a Mac pie, jerk chicken and jerk salmon.   The rice and peas was bland AF with some random coconut shavings on top. My jerk chicken was over cooked (I ate the dark meat because it was still ok) but the breast was inedible. It was literally just slathered in jerk sauce like it was an after thought.  The patty was ok, like any average patty. It was also a bit dry and strangely deformed, as if it had been left in the microwave too long.   The jerk salmon was also on the dry side, but not as badly as the chicken.  Honestly, the only vaguely redeeming features? The coleslaw wasn't bad and the mac pie had an interesting cheese combo that wasn't entirely unpleasant. The patio looked nice, and I wish we had nabbed a spot there instead of the hot-as-hell indoor booth.   Final thoughts: service was hella slow - especially for a Monday evening. I assumed they had takeout orders too but it still didn't sway me. If the food was worth the wait, it would have been acceptable but... Naah.   Skip this place and go have some Italian food while you're in Little Italy."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  I spent an arm and a leg for the food here and was left so dissatisfied. You can get waaaay better quality/tasting Caribbean food in the city at a fraction of the price. Be warned and believe all the negative reviews on here, Google and Facebook. Looks like all the 5 star reviews are coming from friends or family or don't even have any descriptions to them. I even saw the owner give his own restaurant a 5-star rating on Google... the struggle is real.  Anyway, there are better and more affordable options elsewhere, so save yourself the trip. You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"The place looks nice. It could look nicer if the lights weren't so harsh.  But you're really here for the food. Boy, you're in for a disappointment. We ordered a side of very bland rice and beans. I honestly would have been happier with plain steamed rice. The stew chicken was just ok. It came with hard bread. If you want some hot sauce to help the food, be prepared to pay $1.99. The Jamaican beef patty was good. I enjoyed that the best.   Overall, don't waste your money. The people are very nice though."}
{"text":"I went out on last Saturday with a few friends to celebrate my birthday and decide to give this place a try. It turned out to be one of the worst experiences. Horrible service. We ordered three dishes and three beers. After 30 minutes, the waiter came out and informed us 2 out of 3 dishes had finished. We changed our order and waited for another 30 mins. Meanwhile, we had to asked twice before the beers came. And they also ran out of plastic cups for water. In the end, after 1 hour waiting for the food, we finished our beers and decided to leave because we had enough! Regardless of how good the food might be, the service is so horrible that it's not really worth to wait."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with this place all I'm gonna say is this. I just ordered $50 in sushi because I couldn't eat any of this food. Got it go, oxtail was the worst we've ever had, the spicy shrimp was not shrimp. It was prawns. coleslaw was so soggy tasted like it had been sitting out for two days, portions were small PLUS they forgot one of our orders.  I'm pissed to say the least now that I have spent over $100 tonight on my dinner.  The worst."}
{"text":"I wish I can give no stars. Wanted to try this place cuz I saw Kardinal Official came a few times and advertised the place. Waited so long for food to come. There was clearly not that many people in the restaurant. So I don't know what the hold up is.   Black dry chicken and raw in the middle. Very pricey oxtail and pork was a chop with brown sauce. Staff was not friendly. Lots of other places doing better Caribbean food. The chef boasts on and on about pimento wood. Didn't taste it at all. Everything just tastes dry. I think the reason is because, even Scotchie's in Jamaica uses pimento tree branches. Not small dried wood chips that comes packaged that you can buy at a souvenir shop at the Kingston Airport."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad. Ordered the fish fritters, jerk chicken and rice. The fritters are burned and tough. Salt fish is beyond salty. Basic jerk chicken."}
{"text":"What's there to complain about this place? The decor is cute (although they could make the lighting a bit more flattering and less super bright). The food was delicious and had big filling portions. My piece of shit ex boyfriend  and I ordered the jerk chicken, plaintain, pepper shrimp, rice and peas. Everything was just really good. Even my piece of shit ex bf who is from Jamaica enjoyed the food and he is pretty critical of Eating Jamaican food that isn't home made or from certain restaurants. The service was extremely friendly and good. My only suggestion would be for them to peel the pepper shrimp. They tasted amazing and I understand that they taste better in the shell, but honestly I didn't come to a non bib wearing restaurant  to get dirty and do all kind of dirty work peeling shrimp. Especially if you are there for a date or something. Change the pepper shrimp and everything else is good to go. ,"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst and OVER-PRICED Carribean food in the city. They only thing they have going for themselves is the decor. Please do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere. Ordered the jerk chicken and oxtail with rice and peas... $50+ later and almost was unable to consume it. Same food, larger portion and better quality and flavor would cost around $30 in most other places. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Dannnnng. Best breakfast I've ever had in Toronto. Plantains fried to perfection. Melt in your mouth oxtail. This place is next level. Super bright and comfortable space as well. Very friendly staff. Best hog sauce I've had in awhile & I'm a hot sauce head. Next time I am in the city this will be the first place I visit."}
{"text":"It really pains me to write this review. You have been warned do not waste your money on this restaurant. It is a complete insult to Caribbean food. The decor of the restaurant is nice, the service was friendly and the food came out in a timely manner. We ordered the chicken wings plate which came the smallest quantity of chicken and barely a scoop of coleslaw/bread. How is this possible? The chicken was not jerk it was purely hot and inedible. I wouldn't serve that to my worst enemy. Also we ordered a side of plantains which were good and quantity matched the price. I was determined to not believe the previous Yelp reviews but they are accurate. This place has great potential but you have to deliver with taste and quantity."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but it's not good. I have eaten here 5 times because it is close to my work, but despite giving them the benefit of the doubt, I can't even come close to recommending this place. The food is ok at best with a price tag that doesn't suit the taste. The service is awful, it's like the staff doesn't know what they are doing or maybe they don't care. It is super slow and in almost every instance, they take twice as long as they expect. I don't know why this place would survive."}
{"text":"Recently I had lunch here. It was a horrible experience. I was drawn in by the visible cool and funky factor of the wood floors and tin on the walls. Everything went to hell after that.  First of all, about 4 items of the 10 item menu were unavailable. Not to worry, the pork (12.99 for a half-pound) I wanted was available. I ordered and was told it would be 15 minutes, which seemed long for pre-done pork and slaw, yet I waited.   1. I was offered ice and a glass for my Coke, yet never got it. 2. The order took 45 minutes to arrive. If you have an hour for lunch, this sucks. I noticed a few of the only- a-few customers complaining about the long wait to little avail other than being told to wait more. One poor sucker who had called in a to go order was asked (after he had been waiting at least 25 minutes) if just \"wanted to eat it here.\" 3. Loud music blared through the impressive speakers. If you like loud music where every song has the \"n\" word or some demeaning reference to women, or if you don't want to hear yourself think or someone else speak, you will love it. 4. The pork itself, when it finally arrived, was flavourful, yet a bit salty and came in chunks that were more fat than pork. It was topped with a nastily hot pepper. It came with a decent side of slaw and 2 small pieces of white bread. 5. The pork, a small glass bottle Coke, and 15% tip (because while I wanted to give a low tip 15% or no tip were the only low options) comes to $20.78. 6. As I paid after my meal, I noticed the picture above the cash that included in the photos section. Had I seen this before, I would have left. Objectification of women, while a lucrative enterprise, is not what I want to support."}
{"text":"New bite on the block. Moment you walk in, you are taken back by the beautiful decor and vibe. Felt like I was at the beach in the islands enjoying 'real' Carribean food. Greeted by a polite female at the counter who handed the menu which was attached to a clipboard...Funky! The gentleman behind the counter also greeted us and was very polite. Explained the difference in sauces and the heat level. Now the food...the best part. Jerk chicken (1/2 lb) was perfect portion for one. Ordered a side order or veggies which was very flavorful. Slaw, jerk BBQ sauce and the chicken is a marriage made in heaven. Compliments each other very well. In short, this place is great bang for the buck. The whole experience was amazing. Looking forward to going again to try the shrimps."}
{"text":"Funny how most reviews are either 1 star or 5. Lol. Seems all of the 5 stars reviews mention the pimento wood. Pimento wood, hardwood, pinewood, Hollywood, it doesn't matter - The food is not good.  I tried this place months ago and I really wanted to like it, but it just wasn't good. I felt compelled to write this review because it seems like all the 5 star reviews are fake, with some newish reviewers leaving copious amounts of other reviews in a very short amount of time.   Our pork was hard and dry, with an out of place molasses coating. Too thick. What are you trying to hide? Dry pork? A pound of molasses can't  save any poorly prepared protein. It came without coleslaw. When we were half finished our half pound of jerk pork (which we weren't going to finish, not because we were full - we just couldn't continue),  the chef came out with a small side if coleslaw and said that they didn't have any when they sent out our plate which was supposed to have coleslaw in the first place.  We also had a patty,  mac pie, both rum punches and some red stripe. Those drinks were $8 each. They should have been $6. Not because I'm cheap, I still tipped that confused counter girl over 20% because she was nice and I felt mostly sorry for her because I looked around and figured the clientele wasn't going to help her out with her school bills at all.  Back to the food - I like heat, but why do you have to put those raw, hot pepper on your patty and your mains? Makes  no sense. If you want people to taste your food and appreciate it, why do you have to aim to numb and burn the taste buds of people just trying to have a simple patty? Coconut doesn't belong on Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Decided to finally to try this new Jamaican/Caribbean restaurant. Very clean and welcoming inside and out. Ordered a Jerk Chicken sandwich special for $7.00 and though the flavours were there, pulled numerous small chicken bones out of my mouth with each bite -- not how I wish to eat a sandwich. I may give them a second chance, but I may just wait. Too bad as this corner needs a good restaurant, but no one seems to get it right."}
{"text":"CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING PLZ CLEAN YOUR SHRIMP/ PRAWNS. Make sure your your oxtail is off the bone and not chewy. Your place looks soo nice but doesn't match the food. The portions and  quality you give for the price is ridiculous.  14.99 for 4 oxtail chunks which don't melt in my mouth is robbery. DONT get robbed like I did I hope they realize what they doing wrong. I didn't try the jerk chicken cause they didn't have it hopefully that is good. I payed 45 dollars for peppered shrimp oxtail plantain (was delicious ) and and brown rice and coleslaw.  I'm just warning others with this review."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences of my life. As a general rule of thumb in Toronto, if you want to avoid a bad experience, wait for a newly opened restaurant to iron out its service issues. I hope this place is new or otherwise it's just a disaster. So to back up my statement: we walk in and are instantly confused by the ordering system. The guy at the cash gives me next to no help and the typical entitled restaurant staff judgemental look when I ask him \"so how does this work?\", as if it was a straightforward process. To be clear, I am confused because when we try to sit down I'm being told that the seats are needed as they are reserved, as in a sit down restaurant although it's set up as a take away joint. As a side note, no one ever used those seats aside from random walk ins like us. The Bob Marley playlist ends and music stops, no one bothers to hit play again so you have this awkward vibe of extremely overlit led lighting, no music and people walking in confused with no one directing them. Food takes 40 minutes to arrive, people who ordered behind us get served and finish their meal before anything shows up. We still don't have cutlery or glasses of tap water as ordered, we have to ask for this. We enquire about the food, being told our order of mac and cheese is holding up an order of oxtail and curry goat. Uh, what? Food arrives, its mediocre. The mac and cheese that supposedly held everything up is awful and tiny but awful enough that we don't bother finishing it. Mains are ok, nothing exceptional, isnt oxtail supposed to be tender and not rubbery? No sides arrive, we have to get up again and ask for the side of bread and a tiny bit of coleslaw. Real tough handling here since those are such complex items. At this point no food would taste good given the frustration of this experience. Should have gone with my instinct and had Pat's Homestyle on queen, you can always trust the ones that have been around forever."}
{"text":"The initial blog reviews and pictures gave me very high hopes for this place, and as a fan of the owner's excellent Dirty Bird locations, I expected another hit, but the end result left a lot to be desired. While many menu items seemed enticing, I stuck with a few safe bets to begin with, namely the Jerk Chicken and Mac Pie (Coconut Milk Macaroni N' Cheese). The mac & cheese side was probably as expected for such a side: reheated, lukewarm, with the cheese somewhat congealed and not entirely melted, yet not by any means horrible, and completely edible. The Jerk Chicken was however only barely acceptable. It was dry (obviously cooked hours before and re-warmed before serving), yet not quite to the extent of a KFC order left under the heat lamps for hours. The molasses in the jerk sauce were much more evident than any jerk seasoning, and although I ordered a medium spiciness level, it was no hotter than one would typically expect for a mild rating. Surprisingly, the most acceptable part of the plate was the coleslaw, which is something I usually despise. It was mildly sweet and vinegary, but a refreshing contrast to the rest of the dish. The worst part of the meal however were the slices of \"hard bread\" that accompany the dish. They're dry, dense, tasteless, and add  nothing of value to the meal. They'd be much better off using Wonderbread, or simply leaving the bread off the menu entirely. It's unnecessary. It doesn't matter if it's \"authentic\", it's horrible.     Outside of the meal itself, the entire seating and payment system is a bit awkward. You order and pay at a booth up front, and presumably leave a tip in the plate provided there after paying, yet you receive service from a server after the fact, who brings you your drinks and food, which leaves one to wonder are the initial tips shared properly, and should you tip for the second time on top of the initial tip if the service is good/exceptional? What if one requires additional drinks: Do you order from the server or go back up to the booth? It's a really unorthodox and needlessly confusing set-up. Also, the drinks are not listed on the order card you fill out and hand in, nor is there a board with their selection and prices (a few but not all options are displayed intermittently around the order booth, but could easily be mistaken for decor). The mildly clueless/spaced-out girl at the cash didn't think it necessary to explain the options either, so it meant having to squeeze their selection out of her. While the cloth napkins are a classy touch, they don't really lend themselves well to the cuisine being served. Disposable napkins would be more appropriate.   And as many online reviews have stated, the music is unpleasantly loud. You'd think they would have read about this and adjusted it after nearly a month of complaints,  but apparently not."}
{"text":"This is legitimately one of the worst meals I've ever had in my life. My god this place has horrible food. When we arrived they told us they were out of the jerk chicken, jerk pork, and the smoked turkey. Which were all 3 of the things I would have ordered. Regardless I got the peppered shrimp with brown rice and my friend got the goat with curried vegetables.   To start they didn't serve me shrimp, they gave me prawns. If you own a restaurant you should probably put on the menu what the food actually is. It was disgusting. It tasted like the prawns arrived last week and sat in the fridge until I ordered them. They were inedible they tasted that bad. The brown rice was also awful. It tasted like cinnamon and it was undercooked. Truly disgusting.   My friends goat was okay but quite under whelming. The curry veg really stole the show though. We opened up the box and it looked like someone had thrown up their curry vegetable and served it to us. And ya, it tasted exactly like that too. In fact I said \"this tastes like prison food\".   They also oddly serve every meal with a piece of dry white bread. Not even wonderbread, but something even more fake than that. It looked like bread that would be a part of a display in ikea.   In short- please do not eat here if you value your taste buds. This was truly bad food and it's expensive. $20 directly to the trash. I wish I could give negative stars for this place."}
{"text":"Food was 30 minutes delayed because of their broken iPad. Came for the $5 jerk chicken special but they overcharged and had to do the math for them for my correct change. Worst service ever. This was my second time here and both times the service was atrocious. Two Elite thumbs down.   Pro tip: for jerk chicken, go to Rasta Pasta instead, it's 10000000% better."}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst meal I've eaten in a restaurant in I can't remember how long. Everything I ordered was terrible with the exception of the fried plantain. Waited an hour for our food even thought there was only a handful of other customers. My friend and I both ordered the half pound of jerk chicken and it was INEDIBLE - like so dry there was a hard crust where they had cut the chicken breast in half. I sent it back and the staff apologized and brought me another one. Again - super dry and just really really bad. The skin was either soggy or not there, the bbq sauce is drizzled all over rather than basted and it's sickly sweet and molasses based which is not even close to authentic jerk whatsoever. I sent it back a second time and the third time I just told them forget it. The chef de cuisine came out to apologize and informed me that all the chicken is dry like that because they cooked it the day before on the smoker and reheated it that day. I was HORRIFIED that they could serve day-old reheated jerk but several other staff members who had gathered told me the same thing - they hadn't even lit up the smoker that day and it was a Friday night that I was there. My friend had diarrhea all night after eating. The review below that says it tastes like it was cooked, cooled, reheated, cooled and then microwaved is pretty much accurate. You could potentially get lucky and get some chicken when it's freshly cooked which might account for the one or two good reviews but my advice is DO NOT eat here unless you want to get sick from bacteria that sets in to chicken that's not fresh and not held at proper temperatures. What's crazy is the chef/owner is posting videos on instagram of all his chicken for the day fully cooked on the smoker at 8:19am - so that chicken is gonna sit in a warming oven alllllllllll day and the resto is opened till 2am and that's if you get to even eat it that day. You can only imagine how long that dry chicken sat around if I got served it the next night! It's a recipe for diarrhea and is probably against health code regulations. Makes no sense."}
