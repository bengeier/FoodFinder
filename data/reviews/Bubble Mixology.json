{"text":"It was ok. The ice creams are kinda bland. The portion are too small for the price. I tried the strawberry, green tea, banana, and earl gray flavor. It was all ok."}
{"text":"The banana ice cream is awesome! Their waffle is so soft, too! My kids want to go back!"}
{"text":"The ice cream is so smooth, creamy, and tasty! They have some unique flavors and the waffles are good! It has a very clean and friendly environment."}
{"text":"Love the icecream. They just opened , when i went there they provided free icecream to taste, so kind and nice place! I will be back with my kids , they will love ! Especially chocolate flavor is so creamy and rich flavor, wish more menu to order also teas !! Expect more coming soon !!!!! Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Ice cream I have never eaten in my life!!!!! The ice is made by liquid nitrogen  Store atmosphere is perfect! Clean, beautiful, and pretty.  Clarks are really nice and helpful.  Flavor is not much, but it's still amazing! Texture is strangeness that you've never tried before.  I tired the Regular cup size. My friend ordered the Waffle cone. We definitely recommend to try the waffle or bubble waffle. I am pretty sure that I will be there ASAP!!!!"}
{"text":"We went there today . I will describe what we ordered.  We were 5 people , and we ordered 2 banana icecreams with 2 egg wafflecone , 2 strawberry flavors with egg wafflecone , chocolate icecream with cup waffle cone. Banana flavor was good , best thing for me is its not too sweet and soft richiness. There were 3 staffs were working , its little slow but they served perfectly , and saved some left over in the freezer and i could take them home :) thank you  There were few customers in the store , they could use frew wifi and used their labtop, nice and quiet place good music , i will do some meeting in there later ! Parking was easy , also easy to find, good location , i hope they can have easy snack so i can grab!"}
{"text":"We came here for dessert after dinner with our grown kids. They were so excited when they saw this on Yelp with a 4 star rating. It was just average. There was no wow factor at all in the presentation like the  other places we've been to. The ice creams were average. The employees were nice, the 2 girls were very friendly. 5 oz was $4.50 plus tax. 7oz was $5.50 plus tax. Slush was $4 plain, we wanted to add jelly but they were out. We will not be returning here."}
{"text":"The mango black tea was ok. Nothing special. I also ordered the strawberry farm bubble waffle. I told the cashier that at other places, I've had original waffle with chocolate chips inside the bubbles. She told me she could do that and charged me extra for the chocolate chips. I tipped her well. I received my bubble waffle with the chocolate chips scattered on top instead of inside. I thought she misunderstood what I meant, but while I was eating it, she came over and told me that she forgot to add the chocolate chips inside the bubbles when she was making it so she just put it on top. \"Hope that's okay.\" No.... that's not okay. If you misunderstood, that's one thing. I can forgive that. But, if you made a mistake, you should've corrected it. Throwing chocolate chips on top is NOT the equivalent of melting them inside. It's like putting chocolate chips on top of a plain cookie when someone asked for a chocolate chip cookie. NOT THE SAME! I would not have asked for chocolate chips if I had known she was just gonna throw them on top. She's the one who said she could do it."}
{"text":"They are having free samples rn. The matcha ice cream is super tasty and it tastes exactly like what i had in japan. Luv the decoration btw!"}
{"text":"The liquid nitrogen ice cream is so good and creamy. I am a matcha lover, and my favorite way to get my fix is with the matcha affogato. These guys are using high quality matcha with less sugar. We should be grateful this sweets shop is not trying to get us to eat too much uneccessary sugar. The nitro iced tea is also good, also naturally sweet. I'm loving these no-sugar needed options."}
{"text":"The next big trend in icecream! Nitrogen frozen, less sugar, dense, creamy goodness in a cup. Nitrogen infused coffee coming soon too! A must try."}
{"text":"Looks like a great place to hang out for some ice cream. But we were disappointed after paying almost $11 for two scoops of nitrogen ice cream. We ordered one chocolate and one strawberry. Honestly, there's nothing special about them. Neither flavor or texture was anything to pay that much for. Good luck to them."}
{"text":"It's a good chill spot you can come and do your homework or just need some space. Nice and friendly staff. Food  and ice cream is insanely delicious! Will come back. If you want to take somebody to a date, this is one stop you can do. 10/10 wows!"}
{"text":"I go to bubble Mixology almost everyday now! Its the only icecream i want in town! Their nitrogen infused coffee affogato with their coffee icecream is a must try! I love the new \"build your own Bubble Waffle\" menu I got the \"thai breeze\" chocolate-coconut bubble waffle with thai tea icecream banana whipped cream and chocolate-coconut pocky sticks  Prices have gone down since their soft opening and they have a new drink menu! Nitrogen coffee milk was of course my first pick  guys their icecream and waffle batters are all hand crafted and authentic  so for those of you who appreciate real tea, ingredients with natural flavors this is the spot to go!  Their staff members are great! pleased with their progress on the menu and i am definitely their return customer for as long as they are here"}
{"text":"I was following this place on social media and really looked forward to their delicious looking nitrogen ice cream and iced matcha latte!  I can definitely say my brother and I were very pleased with our visit!  I enjoyed a creamy sesame small cup... watched it made my hand with the nitrogren smoke blowing out of the mixing machine and everything... super cool to watch!  And my iced matcha latte was very tasty. All natural ingredients... very earthy tasting. I don't like it very sweet and the way they made it was spot on.  The customer service was great. The lady informed us it was a soft opening and not everything was up and running yet... they were both very knowledgeable and enjoyed what they were doing.  The location is great; right in Chinatown... plenty of parking, easy to find, and loads of seating inside with a restroom.  I can see this place becoming very successful!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice ice cream place and I like the texture of the nitrogen ice cream they have but the flavors are a bit subtler than other nitro places I have been. Nice to see that they are adding more things to their menu. I would like to see more ideas and pre selected cool combos than just having a lot of custom options. Might have to change things up for the winter time though.   Also the location is a little hidden so it might be helpful to have a sign on the street or somewhere nearby to direct people. The space is also nice and modern."}
{"text":"Nitrogen ice cream has finally hit Vegas! If you want a side of science with your sugar, this is the place to get your fix. Much like the rolled ice cream spots popping up all over town, your dessert prep includes a bit of a show so have your camera ready.  The menu offers ice cream in limited flavors (several of Asian influence, per the Chinatown-adjacent location) along with waffle cup options and milk teas. Location is large with plenty of seating and custom wood work, along with local art on display for sale in the back. Service was polite with good attention to detail and interested in feedback, always a plus. I tried the black sesame flavor and found it a bit creamier than the other nitro creams I've tried, which tend to be more icy with a different mouthfeel that some may dislike when comparing to traditional ice creams or gelatos.   I visited during their soft opening and the available flavors were limited- it's unclear whether they'll offer more options or rotate the choices, but I'd prefer some more unique flavor options like those at Smitten. I didn't see options for additional mix-ins or toppings, which some people might want to add. The waffle cup and milk tea options were either unavailable or not offered when I visited, but I'll be back to try them both.  EDIT: As of April 2018, they no longer have nitrogen ice cream nor typically Asian flavors, skewing more American (vanilla, chocolate, cookies and cream, etc) and serving up regular (though house-made) ice cream instead, with low prices."}
{"text":"A long bus ride away if you have the patience. We had a 3 day bus pass so this worked out. The transit getting here isn't as efficient as Vancouver (yes I actually made credit to the Transit in Vancouver) but we were full from the last place. The bus we were taking was on the way to a record store so it worked out. I was really happy that this place honored holiday hours as some of the places that were on our list that were way outside the Strip  closed the week before Christmas.  There are a lot of Bubble Tea places in Richmond, BC, however, as a bubble tea person I was curious to see how a place that isn't traditionally known for the bubble tea actually does bubble tea. Firstly this place is really clean and sleek in terms of design. I had the mango orange bubble tea which tasted decent and the pearls were soft, however, not too soft. It earned a pass from me considering that I have lots of bubble tea experience. They do serve nitrogen ice cream which is a huge trend right now (or at least a trend in 2017) in Vancouver, BC. I shared a bowl with the bestie. The prices were decent even with the exchange and the customer service was friendly. I did take a few second video of the nitrogen process and posted it on my Instagram."}
{"text":"I love how pretty this place is and their waffles are amazing. I've never tried Nutella until I bought my waffle with Nutella and strawberries.. i forgot what it's called. But my favorite one is the yellow tail with banana! It's delicious and so are their boba drinks, I've tried a few and I love them.   It does take a little bit for you to get your drinks since they make it right after you order, I just wish they were a little colder and if they could use the plastic seal to it instead of the lid.   Other than that, the two girls that have helped me out are so nice, especially the shorter Asian one. She even know what I always order :)  Cute little place :)"}
{"text":"I tried this place out with a couple of friends. Gotta say, it impressed us as it exceeded our expectations. The interior of the shop itself was very modernized and cute at the same moment. Not only that, but me and my friends tried the Iced peach tea and it was pretty settle; not too strong in the taste of sweetness which is just how I liked it. Also, the green tea ice cream was very soft and smooth. The flavor was just right."}
{"text":"Cute and special ice cream spot! Highly recommend! Definitely a cool idea/snapchat worthy and each ice cream is made to order! Very delicious and creamy for a reasonable price if youre near chinatown!"}
{"text":"Recently open. The location is a bit hidden and easily over looked. It's in the same plaza with KJ Kitchen (right behind it) and Mediterranian market. Parking is easy.   Nitrogen ice cream is on the rise and this one offer different flavor. Ingredients are all natural and fresh. They use US made chocolate THCO which is based in Berkeley, CA. They also have black sesame flavor. They also have Nitrogen Teas beverages.   We did not try the drinks this time but we ordered the chocolate with Matcha bubble waffle. I thought the waffle taste great. The batter was not too heavy and was crispy. The chocolate ice cream was not overly sweet so you can taste the real chocolate.   RECYCLEABLE cup to help our planet, very thoughtful! Variety of drink cups, so cute. They also have split cups if you choose two different drinks.   They currently have no lactose free or gluten free items on their menu. The owner mentioned they are developing new flavors and gluten/lactose free are next. I also wish they will have exciting exotic fruit taste like in CA such as Jackfruit, Durian, Lychee, etc.   Ice cream start at $5 and up. Drinks are $4.50-$8. Waffle cup is $6.50.   Will come back and try their drinks next."}
{"text":"Today I finally got to try this place out and after reading these reviews. The place was very clean and had a nice ambience though, but I was very disappointed in the quality of the ice cream and drinks.   Let me start off by saying that the girl making the ice cream, did not wear a hair net or had her hair tied.  Ice cream: The best thing about the ice cream was the consistency. It was very smooth and melted nicely; however, please be aware, the sugar content is very low.  Drink: I got the Nitro Zomba Pearl, which taste like a normal white tea, nothing special. They also have you sweeten it yourself with different sweeteners on the side (honey, brown sugar, stevia, and cane sugar). I was just disappointed it was filled 3/4 of the way with just ice. It was even hard to put the straw in because there was so much ice."}
{"text":"I came here way back at the soft opening. They offered me a free sample of green tea ice cream, it tasted so good so I came back again.  Environment: They use white color a lot in store, and I like the way they present their work station in front of the guest. We can have something to watch while we waiting. This place is also peace and quiet, I like to spend time here chitchat with friends.  Staffs: The employee were friendly, they gave me suggestions for drinks and desserts, super patient.  Dessert: I ordered the bubble waffle with strawberries. I love the sweetness of the strawberries combine with the sugar powder on the waffle. Crunchy and soft taste at the same time.   Bubble tea: I ordered both Dirty Horchata and Mocha Latte. They both were nice options. Mocha latte is a must for me over here.  Overall: nice employee nice mocha latte. I would come back again."}
{"text":"If you're into bubble waffle and ice cream combos, this place is the way to go!! I had the black vanilla ice cream with original bubble waffle and it was super yum! The black vanilla does leave your teeth and mouth with a black stain though, but it's easily washed away aha Would recommend if you're craving sweets :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the matcha (green tea) ice cream with the original bubble waffle very delicious! The ice cream was a little too rich and had a \"buttery\" consistency but overall very enjoyable! It is a little pricy though, I ended up paying $8 for dessert..."}
{"text":"They are open again with a giant Purple Coffee Mug decal on their window! The only problem is they never advertise that they are open again, they should at least put a banner, can't wait to go try them out!"}
{"text":"We walked over on a spur of the moment to get some ice cream after eating at one of our favorite spots, TangTangTang. Holy cow it was delicious and the service was fantastic. The ice cream was so incredibly creamy and the right balance of flavor without being overly sweet. The bubble waffle was INSANE. It was the best of fair food without the bad. This is a fun spot to stop after dinner for a nice treat"}
{"text":"This place was am amazing topping to a nice day out with my family. My family and I like venturing out to try new things.  I had the sweet sensation and my husband and son had the Smores.  I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place ...yummy food....inviting and clean...friendly owner and  staff....the thai tea ice cream is so good....."}
{"text":"Ordered: Taro Milk Tea with boba Jasmine Milk Tea with boba  My friend ordered the taro milk tea with boba and I ordered the jasmine milk tea. When we ordered it, they stated that they were out of boba. Understandable because it was about an hour or less until closing time. So we ordered the jelly topping (aloe jelly I think it was?!) in place of the boba. When my friend got her drink, she received thai milk tea instead. She didn't mind the mistake so she took it. When she drank it, she was not fond of the drink at all. She stated that the thai milk tea did not taste like the traditional Thai milk tea and that it was overly sweet. I then tried my drink. I did not taste the tea at all. It was pretty much super sweet milk. I unfortunately did not like it to the point that I took two sips and then tossed the rest out. Maybe it was an off day? Not too sure. Will have to go back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out. Their pictures and menu looked amazing based on everyone's reviews! I get there and the menu is nothing like what was posted. Options were so minimal. Almost half of what I saw wasn't even offered! They had a few waffles to choose from and when none of them caught my eye and asked the cashier if I could customize it to my liking she said \"no customizing\" - really? But the worst part was the way she said it... she said it as if I should've known it and seemed a bit irritated that I even asked her. Customer service needs work.   None of the uncustomizable options stuck out. I drive 20 min for this to be very disappointed. I ended up just getting the s'mores because I was already there. The ice cream portion compared to other places I've had similar type of dessert was very NON- GENEROUS. It made the rest of my puff waffle and slathered chocolate sauce too rich! Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"A new nitrogen ice cream shop has rolled into town. Unlike the rolled ice cream fad, the shop relies on nitrogen to cool their ice cream. The shop is hidden inside a plaza on Spring Mountain. This brand new shop hasn't even had its Grand Opening yet - coming soon on the 16th.  As any brand new store, the interior of the store is disgustingly gorgeous. The store has a plethora of seats and tables for use.   The ice cream itself is extremely creamy and rich; not hint of ice crystals or odd flavor in the ice cream. The egg waffle that came with is crunchy, and hard."}
{"text":"Yum! The ice cream was very creamy and good! The waffle and bubble cones are not worth the extra price... and customer service could be a bit better... was cool to watch the process!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from my sister so we decided to try it out. We heard they had the ice cream with nitrogen so that's what we were looking forward to, but they told us they don't do it there anymore. What a bummer. So we decided to try the hongkong waffles with ice cream and some drinks. The one I got was the matcha and mango drink but with no boba. Then we also got the yellow tail with vanilla ice cream (which was my favorite out of the three we got), matchaholic with strawberry ice cream, and the monkey bar with vanilla ice cream. I wouldn't mind coming back to this place if I was on this side of town again."}
{"text":"I was sad to see when I came that there was no longer nitrogen ice cream.  It's a large space but was surprised that on a Friday evening that it was mostly empty.  I shared the s'mores and monkey bar with my family.  The waffle itself was pretty standard along with the chocolate ice cream that we ordered, very generic tasting.  The marshmallows were really tasty however.  I wanted to like this place more but it fell short of my Hong Kong style waffle expectations."}
{"text":"Was craving for some dessert with my friend after a tasty meal and figured this would be a good place to check out because we were intrigued by the various dessert options and I have to say that I was disappointed with the drink I ordered.   I ordered the earl gray lavender milk tea and ended up getting a very watered down tea with a bunch of ice! I could taste a few hints of the tea, but that was about it. I think there was literally more water than milk or tea with this drink :(. I always test a place out based on their milk teas and this place was a flop!  My friend ordered the Matcha waffle which was pretty tasty! It was crispy, light, and you could taste hints of matcha with each bite. I would recommend ordering that if you are not a heavy dessert person, but still want something yummy to munch on.  I have this place two stars because of my drink, but I'll probably update this review if I ever come back to try something else. It's just disappointing if a place can't make a decent milk tea drink."}
{"text":"Nice and clean environment! The ice cream is not too sweet and healthy taste. My favorite was lavender earl grey, and I will try with some toppings next visit. The bubble waffle is so delicious too. I also tried teas and it was really refreshing. Trendy nitrogen ice cream, you should come and try!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place! First time I try nitrogen ice cream and it was great! Tried the strawberry and black sesame! So good and smooth!! Definitely a thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Fun place with good quality tea's. The charcoal bubble waffle was a cool idea. They have an awesome assortment of unique ice cream flavors that you don't see often. I also went to a hosted event at Bubble Mixology on a separate occasion, so if you need a place to hold a little private event you could inquire about that."}
{"text":"Trendy Nitrogen frozen icecream, taste awesome. They are having their grand opening at September 16. Tea or drinks are another options for those who don't prefer icecream.  Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Try out this new spot. I love the modern contemporary design they have and the laboratory look with stainless steel appliances behind the counter.   Bubble mixology offers more than just Boba and teas. Dig into their waffle treats with the variety of ice cream and toppings.    I ordered the Strawberry Farm (Chocolate powder, drizzle and fresh strawberries) and Sticky Cloud (housemade whipped cream, caramel drizzle and chips) both on top of a chocolate and black charcoal bubble waffle. In addition, I got a Thai tea frappe with 2 scoops of Oreo ice cream inside. I just created a perfect combo with that drink lol try it out, and share your thoughts if you like it"}
{"text":"I came here for both their soft opening and grand opening. I personally like Sweet Spot better because they have more flavor options and topping choices.   Texture is one of a kind. It's extremely smooth and rich. I did notice that there are some inconsistency where one of the nitro ice cream was sticky, like a caramel and stuck to my teeth.   Like I mentioned the flavors are limited. On grand opening day however, they had new flavors which were lavender earl grey and cinnamon ginger. I heard their flavors will be rotated weekly so I may need to be on the look out for their next rotation.   So far I've tried most of the flavor in ice cream (chocolate, matcha, black sesame, vanilla) and matcha latte and all had bold flavors.  I'm not sure with their price point and tiny portion, it would be worth coming here as opposed to other nitro places that offers more customizable options and toppings (and much bigger portion for the same price). Looking forward for them to step up their game."}
{"text":"This is no longer a liquid nitrogen ice cream vendor. Instead, it's an inexpensive yet surprisingly solid dessert shop.  Bubble Mixology is in a small plaza on Spring Mountain near Jones with such notable neighbors as KJ Kitchen and TangTangTang. I'd bookmarked them a while back for liquid nitrogen ice cream, and although I was disappointed to learn that they had stopped making that product, I was more than happy to give them a try.  I didn't get any of the drinks, although those seemed to be pretty popular. I guess that the various teas, coffees, and shakes are the inspiration behind their name, rather than the desserts which I focused on. (I might've grabbed something had I been hungrier or less fearful of caffeine at the relatively late evening hour.)  First off, check out the ice cream prices. They charge $1, $1.75, or $2.50 respectively for 1, 2, or 3 scoops. The scoop size is pretty generous and the texture was smooth and free of ice crystals. I was more than happy to be able to try three flavors, with is half of their very limited and very American assortment. Lack of choices (and Asian flavors) aside, I was happy with each of my vanilla, cookies & cream, and cookie dough.  Next, get ready to be shocked by the waffles. They're the variety which are variously known in other dessert shops as egg waffles, egglets, Hong Kong waffles, etc. The menu lists plain waffles as $2.50 and flavored waffles as $3.00, although I only paid the smaller price for some reason for my matcha waffle. It was surprisingly and pleasantly quite enjoyable. The texture stayed crispy outside and soft inside until the last bite, which took a while because I was eating the ice cream on top of the waffle. The matcha flavor was light, but that's par for the course.  Did I mention that these prices are tax-free? Offering solid entry-level ice cream and some of the better egg waffles at these prices is mind-boggling in 2018. The lowest price I can find elsewhere in town (researching via Yelp photos) for egg waffles is $4, and I'm pretty sure ice cream isn't that cheap except at a certain popular chain with 25 more flavors than you'll find here.  I can criticize them for a lot of things (awkward placement of water/utensil/napkin station, weird setup of menus, out-of-place metal table, relatively short hours), but service was okay considering that there were two people trying to cope with a huge family group of about 15 and cleanliness was on-point. I had a fairly comfortable visit.  Bubble Mixology isn't a true foodie spot or destination to get excited over, but it's a very affordable and competent dessert option should you find yourself in this neighborhood and not feeling as spendy as you'd need to be for trendy sweets."}
{"text":"First off, this place is open on Christmas. Which was a pleasant surprise when my family and I were looking for something fun to do, lol.  This place is really hip! Everything from the minimalist decor to the nitrogen ice cream. The flavors are cool too and range from normal vanilla all the way to lavender earl gray. Which I do not recommend by the way, it was way too soapy tasting. But everything else was really delicious, especially the Nutella flavor and the bubble waffles! It's an additional $2 for a waffle and 50 cents each for toppings. The staff was very nice, and gave my cousin a waffle for free when he went to order it after already receiving his ice cream.  Lastly, although the nitrogen ice cream is a novel concept, it really was just ice cream. Good ice cream though!"}
{"text":"Have to say ice cream was great. Love the flavors that they offered and I have to suggest that you get with the bubble waffle."}
{"text":"Bubble Mixology serves Nitrogen Ice Cream, Egglets, and drinks. They use Nitrogen to freeze their wide variety of ice cream flavor.  My friend and I went their for their boba drinks.  My friend ordered the Matcha with Almond Milk while I ordered Matcha with Whole Milk. We both enjoyed our drinks. Both Matcha goes really well with each milk. You can taste the tea flavor of the Matcha with the sweetness of the milk. You can change the sweetness percentage of your drink.    When we ordered our drinks, they didn't have boba; but, when our other friend met up with us, they were to add boba to her drink. My friend and I ordered around 1pmish, but my other friend arrived around 1:45~2pmish. The boba availability might depend on what time you order.   I like the minimalist style they have in the store with their huge sign. The location was difficult to find since the shop is almost in a corner. Be careful in looking for the shop."}
{"text":"You can see some magical things here. Every time when I walk in, I remember those days I spend in science lab back in my high school by looking those beakers haha  Very cool place!"}
{"text":"We're here today for the nitro ice cream  The kids loved it!! The bubble waffles was good  and service was great"}
{"text":"Looks pretty doesn't taste all that great though. I was pretty excited seeing a new dessert place! A disappointment for sure the drink was very milky didn't taste like matcha at all...the matcha bubble waffle was ok needs to be fluffier and the ice cream wasn't special.  Main thing for me was the customer service I came in at 8pm after my dinner...no greeting and no service at all to help with the menu. The staff definitely did not care to be there or assist us nor smile at us. Customer service is number one in this type of environment...especially when dessert is supposed to be a delight and the staff is just not so delightful."}
{"text":"This place is so unique!! They make each ice cream, waffle, and tea right in front of you! So it's insanely fresh. The brownie ice cream is unreal! The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, and the location is super clean and modern.  I'm so glad we stopped here! We will be back!"}
{"text":"A unique approach to ice cream and tea if you're looking for something different but not too flashy.   What makes Bubble Mixology unique is the fact that they offer flash-chilled nitrogen ice cream that is the smoothest, creamiest, thickest, richest, and most delicious ice cream I have ever had.   The ice creams are made-to-order and the cool thing is that they make it right in front of you. Since they use nitrogen, when the ice cream is being made is looks like a neat science experiment. They also brew nitrogen tea that tastes so fresh.  I ordered their chocolate ice cream along with the Zomba Pearl white tea both were very delicious.   The place itself is very spacious with a variety of places to sit or stand and on the wall hangs an eye catching \"Bubble Mixology\" sign that you can't help but take a photo of. At the counter were they take and make orders it looks like a sort of science lab with beakers, flasks, and test tubes, which is a fitting concept when you see the ice cream being made.   I'm looking forward to my next visit because I am interested in trying their Matcha affogato. Overall I definitely would recommend this place if you're looking for a different spin on ice cream and/or tea."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and to my surprise, it was empty. This location is a bit tucked away in the corner of the market square it's in, definitely not very visible from the street. The place is very spacious and has an expansive food prep area. There were 2 ladies working at the time and they greeted us kindly as we arrived. I ordered a matcha double scoop with Chocolate bubble waffle and white mochi. It took some time for them to whip it up but it was well worth the wait! The ice cream was not too overpowering with the matcha flavor, the bubble waffle was warm and inviting, and the mochi was the perfect texture and fresh. It all come together deliciously and I was extremely satisfied! It is a little bit pricey but I think it is worth it. I would definitely recommend visiting Bubble Mixology to satisfy after-dinner-sweet-cravings! The Bubble Waffles are freshly made to order and so is the ice cream! I also saw that they have a large selection of drinks/teas. Lots of flavor syrup bottles line the wall behind cash register. I plan to come back when I am in Las Vegas again! :)"}
{"text":"Their ice cream flavors are real good, but their portion sizes are not so great when it comes to the price. Customer service is average."}
{"text":"I love how fresh the drinks taste. I got the passion fruit peach tea. The taste was perfect as you can actually taste the tea, passion fruit, and peach. None of them overpowered each other. The sweetness is perfect. I also ordered the STRAWBERRY FARM. And it tasted yummy. Would def order again"}
{"text":"I visited this establishment hoping to have a taste of the ice cream made with liquid nitrogen. I have heard great things about it and was excited to find here on yelp a place that does it. Upon visiting this establishment though, I was surprised to see it was completely empty on a Friday night. I asked the employee if I could have a cup of the ice cream and was told that they no longer did the liquid nitrogen ice cream. I was disappointed but decided to give their regular ice creams a try because I had already driven there.  I was again surprised to see that their ice cream came from a regular tub. I couldn't read the brands name but if I wanted that type of ice cream I would have gone to the super market to get it and paid less. I took my ice cream and left.   There were other things in the menu that did look good...like their waffles. Maybe those are worth a try but I am not coming here again. :("}
{"text":"Nitrogen ice cream!  Need I say more?  The Boba tea was delicious too. Very fun to watch them prepare the ice cream. But even more fun to enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm so happy we stumbled upon this place!  I ordered the Lavender earl gray nitrogen ice cream in a the original flavor bubble waffle sprinkled with fruity pebbles. My mom got the matcha ice cream and my sister ordered the coffee ice cream with chocolate kisses topping. And it was fun to watch them put it all together. The counter is walled by glass so you can watch them poor the nitrogen into the mixer. They even made the bubble waffle in front of me. Dessert AND a show! Great service. Great flavors. Great toppings. And beautiful atmosphere. We didn't get to try any tea but I definitely will soon. I finally found an ice cream shop in Vegas I want to come back to!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. My wife and kids had been here 4 times already. The waffle tasted slightly soft and crunchy. Awesome! Never had something like it before. I ordered a honey aloe green tea. Perfect! Not too sweet. Perfect for me. My kid loves the nitrogen Oreo ice cream, the older one loves the mango slushes with boba. Staffs were friendly and very helpful in helping us to decide what drinks to get. My sister got a Jasmin with boba. We all like our drinks and desert."}
{"text":"This is the most wonderful ice cream I've had in Vegas. Make sure to add the bubble waffle, which is divine."}
{"text":"For anyone who remembered, Dexter's Laboratory from the Cartoon Network Circa 1996-2003, will instantly have a pleasant experience, lol. Actually anyone who loves a little science activity to create a delicious ice cream will have a fun experience. Nitrogen infused have been taking the foodie scene by storm. This particular place uses nitrogen to create different flavor ice creams. I've been here a few times and always leave satisfied. I personally love the matcha flavor ice cream paired with one of their waffle puff cone with white chocolate drizzle and Cinnamon Toast Crunch toppings. However, the possibilities is endless with the different flavors and toppings available.  The whole process of your ice cream gives this place that ohhh and wow vibes. Definitely a must try and instagram worthy joint. The friendly staff is very helpful and patient, so don't be afraid to ask questions. Another great addition to the ever growing dessert places on Spring Mountain Rd. foodie scene.  2017 Yelp Review #60"}
{"text":"Liquid nitrogen ice cream is something you have to experience at least once. After a whole bunch of these nitrogen-themed shops pop up, you've kinda tasted them all.   The place itself is aesthetically pleasing. The actual ice cream, bubble waffle, and teas are alright. It's fun to watch the ice cream being made, but I didn't like the texture that much. It's too... creamy? Like it'll melt once you walk out and are bombarded with the Vegas heat. They have limited flavors of ice cream, bubble waffles, and tea.   The bubble waffle itself is pretty to look but not fun to eat. It was crunchy... not soft and waffle-y. I wasn't able to easily distinguish between vanilla, chocolate, or matcha bubble waffles.  I also ordered a matcha tea. It was a bit bland. I like that they make it unsweetened then you can add your own amount and type of sweetener. But they were very stingy on the ice. My drink was a. It colder than room temp and was not enjoyable. I had to drink a couple sips and then go ask for a whole bunch of ice to cool it down more.   Eh, I wasn't impressed. The hype is not real."}
{"text":"The nitrogen ice cream was pretty good. We got the oreo flavor and it was creamy and not too sweet. The bubble waffle was pretty good too.   I'm giving this place two stars only because the customer service was HORRIBLE. I'm usually easy to please but this place got me to write a review.   We walked in (it was empty) and the employees just looked at us and said nothing. We were staring at the menu for a hot minute and none of them even bothered helping us out or ask us if we need help or anything like that. They didn't even smile at us. Really no acknowledgement. They looked like they hated being there. Lol. Especially being first timers, the menu was a little confusing and a little help would be nice.   Three more parties came and the same thing - no smile, no word, no help.   I just think it would help so much if the environment and the vibe was so much better."}
{"text":"Oops, the first non 5 star review for this place. It is good ice cream for a Vegas ice cream shop, but it would be very, very misleading to say award this place 5 stars while awarding 5 stars to a truly spectacular ice cream shop like Salt & Straw in Portland.  Let's answer the most important question first: it is better than Sweetspot, the other liquid nitrogen ice cream shop in Vegas. Creamy texture, as you would expect from liquid nitrogen ice cream, but oddly enough, also quite gummy and chewy. Decently strong flavors, but nothing memorable.  Vegas is not an ice cream town, as of now. It's a steakhouse town or a celebrity chef town, but definitely not an ice cream town. The best ice cream that I have had in Vegas is at The Patio, which offers sophisticated flavors and a light, refreshing finish."}
{"text":"This review is only on their drinks... I came in after seeing a post on Instagram of a Dirty Matcha Latte, but was left disappointed when I was told they didn't offer expresso. So I settled for a regular matcha latte that tasted like regular milk. Very disappointed.  Overall the stores atmosphere and design was nice. I just hope they improve their menu."}
{"text":"WARNING: sugar overload!!!!!!  Definitely a great dessert place to take your family to. They have so many different options of dessert to choose from and the atmosphere is very appealing to the eye. The price isn't too bad either. I got the nitrogen ice cream with a waffle and it came with some popcorn at the bottom, drizzle and toppings. Literally so hard for one person to eat, so try sharing things. Babe got a boba tea. The price for both was worth it, especially for the sizes they came in! The employees were super helpful, friendly, and made sure we enjoyed everything before we left. We came on a windy day so I'm excited to come back when its warmer outside."}
{"text":"There Nitrogen ice cream is the best ice cream that I ever had! The texture is very smooth, it is not too heavy for your stomach, brilliant idea of putting nitrogen into ice cream! Will definitely go back every week! Loved it!"}
{"text":"This is the cutest after dinner little date spot!! The waffles are perfectly crispy and made to order and the ice creams are all subtly sweet. They customize everything from sweetness levels to amounts of ice and have every topping you can think of (including cotton candy crumbles!!!) YUM!!! 5 stars!! Can't wait to try something else next time!!"}
