{"text":"Worst service EVER!  Had to wait forever before been served, never been ask during meal if everything was ok, if we needed refill or anything.  Never been ask for coffee or desert... NOTHING!  Food was boring, nothing inventive.  We didn't touch one of the plates because it was not good, and they try to charge us for it, even if we mention it very politely, when they dare to finally come to take our plates out.  Will never go back.  This place lack of personality, and services.  Sometime it make me so mad to have to give the 15% tips..."}
{"text":"I cannot attest to the food but the selection of drinks is great and the service impeccable. It is primarily a wine establishment but their beer selection is good and they have some 12 and 15 year choices for scotch. Our waiter was amicable and attentive. We were recommended a pink sangria which was great, and the drinks that followed were quality as well."}
{"text":"Excellent service, ambiance jazzée

Le tartare et les frites sont délicieux"}
