{"text":"I want to give this place more stars because I eat here often but the foods just ok. The reason I eat here often is because their delivery service is the best. The food gets to your door so quickly I'm in shock every time. It's great when your starving and want take out and it's also great when you want delivery other than pizza or Chinese. The prices are really good for the quality and service."}
{"text":"I've ordered from them about three times now and the results are consistent. Good food delivered on time. I normally only order from here when my Greek loving bf wants something so I don't have issues with poor feta or tomato quantities. I tend to order wraps without those ingredients. I do recall though that he passed me his cherry tomatoes and yes, there were only two of them.

My review was inspired because I had a break out of hives recently and in addition to ordering something new from here I'd also stated a new med. My doctor didn't think it was the meds but I did. So when I emailed them asking for a list of ingredients so I could figure it out they got back to me the next day. Great service. We'll be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"NO matter how busy they are = on the phone, delivery orders, internet orders, eat-in or take out, they ALWAYS do a bang up job! The staff is always friendly, patient  and accommodating,
 Was just there tonight and got the dinner for 2.....could be for 4 but lets keep that a YELP secret! 
For $31 taxes in, you get 4 meat skewers of your choice mix and match....pork, chicken, beef and perhaps laaaamb, 2 rice, 2 potato, 2 greek salad, 2 pita. taziki,  and 2 cans of sugary, fizzy delight AKA pop.
My husband is a big eater and he gobbles everything up and STILL has left-overs. I usually eat all the salad, one chicken skewer and pita, but I skip the potatoes and rice....saving the left overs for lunch....if my husband doesn't  get to them first!

The chicken is ALWAYS done to perfection. Super tasty taziki, good for ye olde gaaalic burps after! They recently changed the feta cheese on the salads to a waaaay betta one...it used to be like \"shredded feta\" ( if that exists), now I fell it is more of a proppa fetta!!!!!
Just a stand up, kick arse meal..... enough for a hearty feed for dinner and leftovers to boot for 31 bones.....you kanny go wrong."}
{"text":"Alright honestly? This is the absolute best Greek food in town. I've been going here for years and haven't had a bad experience. I alway order their chicken souvlaki with rice and potatoes, but the kicker is that tzaziki sauce. The amount of garlic in it is ridiculous good. Def recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and expensive food for that little portion. I am middle eastern so I kinda know how Mediterranean food should taste like, but the food in this place didn't taste good at all. The cashier was a rude lady who didn't welcome me. She wasn't nice in the process of getting order. I was upset but I kinda let it go. But when I saw her greeting was totally different with a white couple then I couldn't take it anymore. Terrible experience overall"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some Greek food to go. Prices are low, portions are good, quality is alright. Most meat dishes and the fried calamari can have too much oil or salt at times. However,  the food is still yum but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"We have ordered the dinner for 2 delivered ay least 50 times since this establishment opened and have always had a good experience.

Always arrived hot and the food was fresh. Never had great luck with the baklava dessert, it's been old, so hard and dry that it was next to impossible to cut.  After about the third or forth time, we never ordered desserts with our meal. But the entrees and salads are always a hit."}
{"text":"This us my favourite Greek food in the area. Family owned and operated, the food is all homemade. The only thing I haven't tried here are the fries. I have the souvlaki, gyros, and salads (love love love the village salad) whenever we don't feel like cooking. Takeout/delivery are very popular and they make everything to order so expect at least a 5 minute turnaround on the food. Well worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"The overall food experience is fantastic.
The calamari is cooked perfectly - nice and tender and just the right amount of coating.
The chicken sandwich is fabulous - whatever they put on it, the spice is just right - great flavour.
The tzatziki is out of this world as was the pita - both nice and fresh.
The rice, potatoes and salad were all good also, but I would go back particularly for the calamari, the chicken and the tzatziki - no question.
Portions were generous and it was quick.
I know this used to be a family run place and the new owner(s) has done a nice job of keeping the feel."}
{"text":"Never ordering here again.  They changed the fries from an amazing fresh cut fry with a portion that was huge to a brutal frozen version and half the portion for more $$.  The guy who answers the phone didn't tell us there was combos and instead rang in all of the items separately for more money. Over the past couple months the food has gone from consistent and amazing to something I would never order again.  The food was cold and also took longer than expected to arrive.  Added the bonus... The guy who answers the phone is extremely rude."}
{"text":"We just moved in the neighborhood and were excited to try this place out. I called to place a pick up order totalling about $40 based on a menu out in our mailbox. I mentioned a coupon it had and they said that's only for delivery (coupon says nothing to that effect). So, I cancel the order. My husband calls back to see if they'll extend the coupon...they say how the delivery menu is actually more expensive than takeout or dine in. And that \"everybody does that\"....ummm no! That's dishonest to jack up prices and then claim to offer a \"discount coupon.\" Left a bad taste in our mouths and we will not be giving them business!"}
{"text":"Ordered food. Took 75 minutes. Chicken was so dry I couldn't chew it. One of the 3 salads came frozen. Other than that, the rice was good"}
{"text":"This food is a staple in our house.  The ordering process is so simple, smooth, and accurate every time.  The our times quoted are always reasonably accurate and the food is comforting and delicious.
Definitely recommend.  Can almost guarantee you'll be calling again."}
{"text":"Two full meals (with drinks included) for under $30. Delicious. Very satisfied customers! The service, however, could use some work. Employees do not seem happy. The food though, speaks for itself. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The price is great, the cooking is abobe standard. The only issue is... was that i found sometype of particle in the food which is problematic. However calling seemed to warn the restaurant hopefully resolved the issue. Overall i would recommend except of this situation which arose."}
{"text":"Please note that my review is not for the ambience of this restaurant nor the atmosphere. It is just for the single chicken wrap that I had (take out). For 6 dollars you get a chicken wrap with onions, tzatziki, feta cheese, tomatoes and some very tender meat. The portion is just right: it filled me up but not too much. The bread was so flavourful and soft and I was in heaven while eating. It was a complete surprise since I walked into the place looking for a quick lunch and nothing else in the area appealed to me. The service is very good!"}
{"text":"Got the souvlaki dinner.  You get a TON of food for a very cheap price, but it's not the best.  The chicken skewer in my order was TINY (seriously, it was like three bites worth of meat) and a little overcooked and the rice & potatoes were good, but nothing to write home about.

I guess the biggest disappointment was the greek salad dressing.  It was a terrible oil & vinegar concoction.  Usually the greek salad is my favourite part of any meal, so I have to admit that I was incredibly disappointed.

Overall, it's worth the money if you're looking for some fast and easy greek food."}
{"text":"So I stopped here for dinner. I wanted a greek salad and a portion of gyro - I was charged the same $15 price and they just didn't give me potatoes and rice. The salad was soggy and mostly lettuce. The gyro meat was greasy and not really cooked enough. Won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Way to expensive for what you get, small portions and the feta is bad and cheap, if they cut prices in half I would consider buying it for my wifes friends. You want greek go to Greek Grill on pape, not tofar away and 100 percent better."}
{"text":"There are times in your life you just want a big platter of greasy carbs and grilled chicken.  

Souvlaki express is a great fast-food greek place.  It is not high-class.  The portions are huge.  My husband and I can easily share a meal.  The guys that work there are friendly, and both their takeout and delivery is efficient and well-packed.  I have never dined in, so I have no comment on that."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for take-out. I get the Chicken Greek salad regularly and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I moved into the area this year and was stoked to see a convenient Greek spot off of the Danforth... but after giving it multiple chances, I have to tell you this isn't good food or good value. It isn't even decent food or value. I feel bad because all of the staff are so friendly and fun, but they're just so skimpy with everything other than the filler carbs like rice and potatoes which are cheap for them to produce. One cherry tomato and one olive per salad. an order that comes with tzatziki gets one of those teeny take out containers for dressing, the meat is generally dry, mediocre pita, etc. etc. and the bill is higher than their competitors across the river. MEH. disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food! Massive portions! We got two dinners and chicken souvlaki wrap. So much food. I cannot get over it. Lots of rice and potatoes but the meat tasted great and delicious. 

Delivery man is old and cute :)

Will order again for sure!"}
{"text":"The food here is great for the portions and speed of service. My real gripe is with the online ordering. Even if you are choosing to pickup your food in store, you must enter in your address, along with tons of other unnecessary information. Why do they need this? If I'm just coming in to grab my souvlaki and go back home, in no way is my postal code required during this transaction. This needs to be fixed, as I'm very sick of having to type in bullshit information every time."}
{"text":"I love Greek food and I haven't had a terrible souvlaki until now.  I ordered their pork souvlaki pita wrap one night. The fixings were average with tomatoes, raw onions and tzatziki.  The pita first off was pretty substandard, stale which I can forgive but the meat was DRY, DRY, DRY even with the tzatziki sauce. I know pork is a difficult meat to cook and maintain it's moistness but you're Greeks.  Your people know how to BBQ a whole spit of lamb to a tender, succulent state and not to a dry leathery mess. If you can't even cook the most difficult meat properly, then I'm reluctant to even try your other dishes.  The Greek police will definitely be coming to revoke your status.

Also customer service was lacking which I wasn't expecting much to begin with because this is more of a fast food take out joint, even though they do have table service.  I'm not Greek but the lady owner could have been more personable and have the courtesy to acknowledge my basic human existence.  I don't think that is asking for too much."}
{"text":"Good food, good price. Mostly got delivery from this place and it's always on time. Finally went to the restaurant the other night. The place is clean and the manager is very friendly. Overall, it was a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant today, smiling. I breathed in deeply and said \"it smells good in here\" in a cheery voice. I was ignored. The lady that had been standing near the entrance started cleaning tables and moving stools, making a lot of noise in the process. I waited patiently for someone to serve me. I was surprised when the same lady walked behind the counter and asked if I had decided what I want. I was already annoyed but I was hungry so I placed my order, paid and waited, all with barely a word exchanged between myself and the lady. As I'm watching my meal be prepared by an older gentleman, I realize he's talking to someone on the phone. He's holding his cell between his shoulder and ear while preparing my meal!! Both are just plain RUDE and the second is also a health code violation."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good...except for the lady bug in my salad. Had to throw it all out after that. I was too grossed out. Too bad though because it is better than most fast food Greek restaurants"}
{"text":"Disgusting!! Never again, run fast people!  We ordered chicken pita wraps each and my hubby ordered a combo beef/lamb wrap.  He said the beef/lamb wrap was ok but both of us could not eat the chicken wraps.  Totally processed, over salted and thyme spiced ewww.  Fries were average but $5 for a VERY small container.  Custard pie had water at bottom of container and topping peeled off eww tossed it, tossed the chicken, basically wasted.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"$10 for a Gyro and a plate of potatoes. Potatoes were doused in cayenne and Olive Oil and the oil just collected in the bottom of the plate. They were also super salty. Gyro was also nothing special.

 I know there are not a lot of Greek options down here in this area.  , but really you can walk from here to the Danforth where there are lots of better options."}
{"text":"This is pretty standard Greek take out food, it was not mind blowing, nor was it disappointing, the food is uninspired but sufficient. Their Greek salad contained exactly ONE olive which my friend and I found typical and kind of hilarious. If you are looking for a quick Greek food fix, then you'll find this place up to the task, if you are looking for delivery that is, but if you are looking for excellent Greek food. There is no love in this food, and I'd suggest looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"We have ordered food there twice for office team lunch. 
The first time I had the Chicken Gyros on a Pita ($5.50). I didn't like it at all. The chicken was in weird chunks and tasted meh... 
The second time I had Chicken Souvlaki on a Stick ($3.95) which comes with pita bread and tzatziki. This choice was better, but for my taste the chicken was a bit too lemony.. (I guess they were using some kind of marinade with lemon juice.)

If possible, I would like to stay away from this place from now on..."}
{"text":"The food here is authentic and delicious. The prices are also right. Good daily specials"}
{"text":"More like a 3 1/2. It's a greasy spoon the food isn't amazing, but it isn't bad. The potatoes are swimming in oil and are a bit soggy. The salad is too shredded and comes with if you're lucky one tomato with vinegar with a hint of oil for dressing. 
The meat is quite nice, and I give them props for not being scared of garlic in their tzatziki. 

It's cheap and greasy. What else do you want? It's Greek food."}
{"text":"I usually rate this place a four but I was shocked to get delivery tonight and find not two delicious chicken skewers but.....sliced chicken loaf. Did their delivery man let them down? Do they have new (stingy) owners? Not sure, but it was a big drop in class. From NHL to OHL."}
{"text":"Yummy. 

I had the veggie pita and the chicken wrap. 
Both were delicious but not big enough. 

Decently priced, friendly enough staff.
There's nothing WOW about this place, though. 
The environment isn't one you would want to sit in and have a meal at with a group of friends, but it's good for take-out lunch. 

There's not all that many choices in the area so this is a good place when you just want something to bring back with you to work that you know you'll like."}
{"text":"The food quality is pretty decent, and the potion sizes are quite generous. That said, I don't go here anymore because they took the veggie moussaka off the menu - arguably the best vegetarian choice they had. I was pretty disappointed, also, when they merely said they were \"out\" each time I called for pick-up - I had to take the initiative and ask if they were making it anymore. Bring back the veggie moussaka and I'll change this review to 5 stars ;)"}
{"text":"Fresh. Delicious. Inexpensive.  What more do you need for lunch?"}
{"text":"Very good food! Fresh salad with delicious dressing. Feels like a bit of a teen hangout, but nice overall."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would! I recommend EVERYTHING on the menu. My fave appetizer is the Hummus and my favourite entree is the Chicken souvlaki! My mouth is watering as I write this. If you are a vegetarian, my friend who is also a vegetarian LOVED the spanakopita and greek salad! I wish I had 4 hands... so I could give this place 4 thumbs up! lol"}
{"text":"Just not enough flavor in the souvlaki for me. Had a couple items but none of them stood out."}
{"text":"Love love, love this place, I used to live nearby the area so basically every Friday night I would come in and get take out. Its always cooked right and so filling. Def good food to have before going out clubbing. The owner of the store was really nice to me, had little conversations every time I came in. 

I never dined inside but saw other customers get served, they seemed pretty happy? 

Some of my favorite choices on their menu was the baklava( omg the best) beef burger, chicken burger, few wraps to choose from, nice salad option too and lastly I loved the fries from here. They beat McDonalds fries for me and that's tough to say. Next time your in the queen east area, check this place out, have a burger with fries and finish with a slice of baklava :)"}
{"text":"Got the dinner for 4, which was tons of food.  Souvlaki was good, and everything was cooked fairly well, but very salty. Salads were lacklustre, a giant pile of shredded romaine with one cherry tomato sliced in half, some cucumber, and a light dusting of feta, I'd be happier with a smaller portion but more Greek-like Greek salad (peppers, tomatoes, onions, feta).
Unfortunately they forgot our order of hummus, but still paid for it, so check your order before accepting.

All in all it was okay, but nothing remarkable."}
{"text":"Ordered small lamb souvlaki through foodora .. lamb and rice were very good but the potatoes were too salty for me .. salad dressing was different but pleasant"}
{"text":"Not the best Greek in the area. The gyros is really dry and not tasty. The fries are really bad, definitely undercooked! 

First order there, sorry... we're probably not gonna order again!"}
{"text":"Tony and the crew at souvlaki express are always good for a gyro and a joke or two during lunch hour, even when its jam packed with local highscool kids (the bane of my existence). All the food is freshly prepared and very reasonably priced for takeout lunch during work. The beef/lamb souvlaki is an office favourite as the well seasoned meat is surrounded by a warm pillowy pita. Deelish."}
{"text":"Amazing food, fast fresh clean.  Tony the owner is a stand up guy as well.  I recommend this spot for Greek food 100%"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars because the food was  good and fed me well. My favourite was the tzatziki which was very flavourful. 

 I'm also only giving it two stars because I received bad customer service from ladies that were working there, including someone who looked like the manager or the owner. When I asked this lady very politely if I could get my meal without the paper bag because I already had a reusable bag with me (which I lifted up and showed her), she looked at me as if I was giving her a hard time and said \"how about we just give you the bag\" and proceeded to place the food in her own paper bag and handed it to me.

 For the simple reason of this lady giving me dirty looks and refusing to cooperate in my effort to keep this city a little greener and cleaner, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"@SouvlakiExpress #YELPTO #SOUVLAKI #GREEK

Souvlaki Express is fantastic for Greek grub. Mind you, the portions are massive. So if you are a small eater like me, or have to do a quick lunch, the appetizer portions are good enough. My go-to is the pork, beef or chicken stick. It's just $5 for a souvlaki stick that comes with tzatziki and a pita bread. 

The restaurant does have a dine-in area but it's not too fancy. Not sure I'd come here for dinner. However, I've not been disappointed so far I've always taken to go. And from what I hear, they do a lot of delivery business too. 

The guys behind the counter are super nice and friendly. I was squinting to see the menu because I didn't have my glasses on. And they were happy to help. I'd totes go back again."}
{"text":"My hubby and i always do delivery from this place. They have a special for 2 souvlakis, the met portion is huge! The rice and roast are great too. We always have to get extra tzatziki though. The salad is nice and sour which i like. There are deals on the menu if you dont order the two souvlaki special so keep those for the next time. Nothing bad to say just they should give more rice and roast to balance out the meat. But always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"No onion in their salad for some strange reason and $10 for two wraps deal is for two tiny sad little wraps. Their tiny portions did taste alright but its nothing special. Workers don't wear gloves."}
{"text":"Ordered a dinner for two as take out. Price was good at $24+tax. Came home and we were excited to have some nice greek food and especially the souvlaki. 
Salad came in a quite big box with oil and red vinegar on the side. Salad consisted of tomato, cucumber, lettuce and onion with some feta crumble on the top. This is a standard greek salad and was OK. However, I have had much better feta!
Main course consisted of pork souvlaki, two skewers. Seasoning was good. With this came rice and potatoes. Rice was ok, nothing special. It simply didn't have any flavor to it. Potatoes were odd, as if they'd been cooked in some broth or sprayed with something before serving. However despite this the potatoes were pretty bland too. They just had a light dust of paprika or some other red spice, which unfortunately didn't boost the flavor at all. On top of this some of the potatoe pieces were not fully cooked. To top it off the tzaziki that came with this was the worst I've ever had! I make better tzaziki myself! Don't understand how a Greek restaurant can make bad tzaziki!?!
To sum up; the food is ok at the most but would not recommend if you want nice Greek food. In that case I would rather recommend Papas on Danforth!"}
{"text":"I love how they call themselves \"Souvlaki Express\". Talk about false advertising!!!!

We ordered food online at 7.25 and were given a delivery time of 8.30. At 8.30 exactly I received a voicemail saying they were \"very busy\", and we wouldn't get our food until 9pm. The food didn't actually show up until 9.25pm - exactly TWO HOURS later. 
Called them at 9.15 and all she could say was \"Who told you it would be an hour?\" and then \"Well unfortunately we have been very busy tonight.\"

Yeah, except it's not unfortunate for YOU, is it? Because you're going to get your money, since you lied to us about your capacity to deliver the meal as promised. It is unfortunate for US, the schmucks that sat here waiting for food until 9.30pm.

As for the food: Naturally, it was cold. And very, very ordinary. The \"greek salad\" was a bowl of shredded lettuce, with TWO (literally two) cherry tomatoes and an almost imperceptible sprinkling of something that was supposed to be feta, but could have been sawdust. (At It's All Grk, the new place on Queen West that we WANTED to order from tonight, they give you a whole slab of feta on a Greek salad - the way it is actually served in Greece). A \"large\"chicken dinner, which cost $15 before tax (!!!!!!) was two dried out chicken skewers, tasteless rice, salty soggy potatoes and another bowl of lettuce. Oh my god. I mean I knew Greek food in Toronto is awful, but when it costs this much, and takes two hours to arrive... What the hell?!?"}
{"text":"My once a week go to :) best Greek in midtown by far! Cheap and huge portions for what you get it's definitely a great value for the taste! All home made and always exceptional service"}
{"text":"So I was craving greek food before my volleyball game and hence checking out reviews I decided to check this place out. The place is a small hidden restaurant tucked right next to Shoppers Drug Mart. The interior is nothing special but they have LCD TV's as menus (makes no sense they should've spent the money on the interior). However, it makes sense since the majority of orders here are takeout.

First things first, the price is incredibly CHEAP. I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner for only $10 and it came with a free pop, bargain right there! The service was very friendly and the food was prepared pretty fast (within 10 minutes or so unlike Imbiss down the street which takes like 20 minutes). 

The chicken soulvkai dinner came with a pita cut in half, a greek salad with feta cheese, olives and greek dressing jam packed into a plastic container, a chicken skewer stuffed with tons of rice and tons of potatoes, and tzatziki sauce. There is a TON of food for only $10, it's a great deal! However, you are really paying for the quantity of the food rather than the quality. The food is not horribly BAD, it's just nothing exceptional. 

The salad with dressing was standard, pita was standard, rice was sort of soggy, potatoes were quite soggy as well not roasted and the chicken skewer was alright. I must add that the portions are overwhelming and they give you A LOT for $10, it really is a bargain... Until I noticed one thing, the whole thing was DREDGED in OIL.

The instant i reached into the bag to grab my food my fingers were actually oily. When I was eating the potatoes and rice I could see oil at the bottom of the container. When I ate the pita I saw the oil make the white paper that it was wrapped in see through. This meal is absolutely smothered in OIL. There is so much oil that when I threw out my container and leftovers there was a pool of oil on the table.

Souvlaki Express is a prime example of quantity over quality. The price is a steal for $10, and the food is quite tasty. However, the incredible amount of oil used and the somewhat alright tasting food makes this place 3 stars instead of 4. There are much better greek places with better quality food and does not dredge their dinners in oil, only come here if you are cheap and are craving LOTS of greek food."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on take out.  As noted in another review, this isn't a restaurant I'd really want to hang out in.  Although this stretch of Queen E is
improving, there is still an old school contingent of regulars here who are a little rough around the edges to put it diplomatically.

On to the food.  When this place first opened and we ordered, I wasn't wowed.  BUT we gave them another few chances and I have to say, their food quality has improved.  For just over $30 including tax and tip, you can get their dinner for two.  That's four sticks of your choice of meat, potatoes, rice, salad, tzatziki, pitas, and two pops.  The portions are large enough to split into two meals.  The souvlaki is always tender and tasty, and the rice and potatoes, though a little on the greasy side, are both flavorful.  My only complaint is their tzatziki should be nominated for most raunchy after taste!  No amount of brushing can conquer that garlic!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for a few people and the service was standard. Our only issue was the amount of salt on the food. It literally hurt the inside of our mouths. One of my friends couldn't eat her meal at all and most of us didn't finish. I'm a big fan of spicy foods but that amount of salt should not be ingested."}
{"text":"For a quick and easy lunch stop, this joint is expressly express. I grabbed a lamb gyro on my way to a study session and it was ready under 5.

That's a good thing right? Not necessarily. 

Frankly, it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. Just meh. Your typical bastardized medi meal. I would have waited another 10 for a better meal. And that's not lacking in mt. pleasant village.

So no points for authentic Greek flavour, or flavour period, but 5/5 for speed and service.
 
Flatlines at 2 stars. Won't be back. 

No recommendations or tips- very little to report. Just keep walking if you're picky."}
{"text":"I wish I had check Yelp reviews first. When I order a Gyro, I expect it to be assembled. Not do it yourself, dipping from the salad bowl, the mixed rice, and super gross soggy fishy tasting potatoes with the dry chicken slices on top. It's the end of August, fresh tomatoes are abundant, so why use 2 cherry tomatoes for the Greek salad? And did they run low on the onion supply? 2 onion rings ( not slices) difficult do dress both your Gyro and Greek salad. I gave the place 2 stars only because the delivery man was so nice, and their tiziki ( sp ?)  was very good ."}
