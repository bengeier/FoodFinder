{"text":"Waiters are rude to customers. They can't even take a simple order properly. Took over 30 minutes to get a simple drink order that a child could make. Waiters don't know who ordered what throughout the restaurant. People at a table would get their order when the rest of the table have finished their order. One lady tried to walk to the washroom but the waiter was taking an order and he told her to walk around the other way (SO RUDE!!!). This place is a zoo. I would highly recommend NOT coming here. This restaurant is over priced. They charge $2 extra to add ice to a coffee."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and service was alright. Our main server was average, nothing amazing. However, to whom i believe is the manager was unbelievably rude! There is a button that allows you to press for service, we pressed it twice 1) to order 2) to try and change a our drink option. The manager guy came by both times and on the 2nd time, he told us to stop pressing it. The audacity... How incredibly rude. Also, i ordered a hot milk tea and decided to change it to cold milk tea. The manager told me they're already making it. Drink didn't come until 20 minutes later. So no, they weren't already making it, you're just too lazy to change my order even though you couldev made an extra 2$ (2$ extrafor a cold drink?) Anyways, food was small in proportions and no vegetarian option. Would not recommend and would not come back. Terrible service and small portions with mediocre dishes."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out. Udon in soup taste good but it's lil bit pricy. $10 with no veggie...."}
{"text":"So happy Woodstone is back! Ordered the chef special: BBQ pork topped w/ fried egg on rice, the lo mein w/bbq pork, and deep fried chicken wings with french fries. The BBQ pork was amazing! Large pieces in both the noodles and on the rice. Not only was the size great but it tasted so good! We finished everything and were completely full, very good portion sizes. Service was quick, seating was comfy, nice decor and clean. Looking forward to trying out some more dishes!"}
{"text":"I went to Woodstone Eatery this evening for dinner and found the interior to be very spacious and bright.  I ordered the Braised curry beef brisket udon for dinner and my friend ordered the Fried salt and pepper wings. I liked that the beef brisket was soft and chewy and the wings were very juicy.  As a drink, I ordered the Mango and Passion fruit soda. I liked that they added mint to the drink and the soda had the right amount of sweetness.  I'm looking forward to trying their breakfast and afternoon specials!"}
{"text":"Woodstone has been missed by people around here.  We are glad to see them return.  It's smaller than their old location but decorated nicely.  My family visited around 11am and their breakfast seem to be quite popular.   The menu is a little smaller than before but still offers a good variety of dishes.  We ordered their signature  baked spaghetti bolognese and HK style bake pork chop on rice.  Everything tasted great.  Both are my kids favorite.  The spaghetti has just the right amount of sauce.  The pork chop was done right, not too dry.  Met some friends their and they highly recommend their bbq pork on rice, will definitely try it next time.  Service was good, very friendly people.  Give it a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ Chicken dish (#49) and two other dishes.  The first dish came within 5 minutes the next took about 30 minutes to come. When the dish arrived, the chicken was undercooked, and still a bit raw. When we flagged the waitress over, she insisted it was cooked and asked us to try it. After additional complaints, they finally went back to the kitchen to reheat the dish. Following up on the last dish, it was apparently never placed into the system.   Overall, slow and terrible service with medicore food.  Safe to say, we are never coming back."}
{"text":"A fancier take on the typical HK cafe. Around $10-12 for a rice/noodle item. Very limited options and small portions.  Curry beef brisket on rice - Nothing special about the curry, not very spicy. The beef was pretty tender. The potatoes were very small bits and were fried before being cooked in the curry. Not much curry taste in the potatoes either. Would've been better if they weren't fried.  BBQ pork/chashu with egg - The BBQ pork is very fatty. I dislike fatty meats so I didn't really like this dish.  Baked pork chop with tomato sauce on rice - Waaaayyyyy too much sauce and too little rice. It was like rice in tomato soup. The pork chops were very thin and chewy.  Hainanese chicken on rice - I didn't like the taste of the rice. The chicken was fine, but only 5 small pieces.  The drinks - All the drinks here just taste like water. I added $1.50 for horlicks and it still tasted like water. $1.50 is very overpriced for some tasteless horlicks. The lemon water had only 1 piece of lemon (see my pic).  1/5 at most. The wait is pretty long also."}
{"text":"This spot was recently opened and it is located in the Apple Creek Plaza. There's lots of parking in this lot so that's always a bonus for sure. I visited on a week night. It was busy, but not too busy meaning that i did not have two wait for table, but the tables were filled.  This restaurant is inspired by the taste of foods in Macau. I tried the cheese baked bbq pork on rice and also the Macau chicken steak. Both were pretty tasted. The food tastes good and the prices are reasonable. You can get a meal for $9-$15 per person. We also ordered the chicken wing appetizer and they were quite tasty too.  I mean this place isn't fancy or absolutely amazing, but it's a good meal at a good price for the regular."}
{"text":"Woodstone Eatery has been all the rave in Markham with its sizzling baked dishes as it's star attraction! Came here with a friend on a saturday afternoon and the place was packed with people. Waited around 10 minutes for a seat which isn't bad.   We decided to share a Spaghetti Bolognaise with the Chicken Cutlet and the BBQ Pork with fried egg.   1) Spaghetti Bolognaise  The taste of this dish is the epitome of cantonese styled spaghetti. Sauce was very sweet and tangy while the chicken was pretty moist. It came in very large chunks. Overall a bit too sweet for my liking, and there was very minimal cheese on top... which was disappointing as I wanted this to be baked to perfection. Overall : 2.5 stars   2) BBQ Pork w/ Fried Egg  This dish has two variations: the one baked with cheese and the one without. Cheese was a dollar extra so we decided against it... major regrets! Dish was a bit dry without it and the only sauce to pair with the rice was soy sauce. BBQ pork was very tender but nothing special. Egg yolk was runny and it encased my rice perfectly. The funniest part of this dish is that they only give you ONE piece of broccoli. Ya know, cause you gotta stay healthy somewhere right! Funny story but my friend and I were fighting over that piece of broccoli that in the end, both of us forgot to eat it. Eat your veggies kids. Overall : 3 stars   Both dishes came with a traditional HK milk tea. Overall ambiance is a very hip cantonese cafe with good prices on typical flavoured dishes. Nothing very special here but nothing terrible. Maybe a little over mediocre. However I would come again to try their baked rice dishes since that's what they are famous for."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place as we were deciding what to have for dinner. This is not your typical HK style cafe (cha Chan tang) if that's what you're thinking. I actually thought that it was from reading reviews and the time I drove by this place. When we seated and had the chance to look at the menu, it wasn't what we expected. I saw pages that says appetizers and build your own bowl...there were other items on the menu but nothing catches my attention. It seems to be more of a western style HK cafe (don't really have a better way to describe it).  We decided to build our own bowl. Both bowls consist of the same base which we chose was yam fries. We both paired it with black pepper sauce. I chose chicken with it while my bf chose beef brisket. Flavour was good but can definitely taste a lot of MSG and sodium in it as we got really thirsty. We also ordered a side of okra which was listed in the appetizer section - it was well prepared.   Staffs were friendly. Ambience was casual. Food was decent for what it is but for the price ($10.50 to build your own bowl), I wished it came with a drink."}
{"text":"Quick lunch late Saturday afternoon. Ordered an infamous Macau Pork Chop Sandwich with Hong Kong style lemon tea. Pork chops sandwich is pretty good. Other than pork chop, it also has some herbs and onions inside the sandwich. At first glance, I was thinking I might need to add some ketchup or other seasoning to enrich the taste. After my first bite, it assures me I can not judge by its plain appearance. It does taste good and no extra seasoning is needed. The Hong Kong style lemon tea , however, tastes a little bit dull. I mean it is kind of plain and does not have tea and lemon flavour in the drink.   My husband did also order a baked dish, chicken with rice in a spicy sauce. It also had cheese on top of the sauce. Although the dish is not very big, it is pretty filling. The sauce is slightly salty to my taste but it's good enough to fill a hungry stomach.   This restaurant has a fancy menu which looks like a newspaper with pictures and descriptions. It is attractive and entertaining to read. I will come back to try other dishes next time."}
{"text":"My friend recommended me here and I decided to give it a try.  Looked on the me menu and there's an item with a picture  that said \"must try\" and so I ordered it.  It was basically baked Char Siu in rice with a red sweet sauce, a fried egg, and cheese.  I found it too sweet for my taste.  My friend who ordered a baked Portuguese rice was much better... wish I had ordered that instead.  Overall it was alright... I would not have paid $10.99 for Char Siiu baked rice.  Being the most expensive baked rice on the menu I expected something much better.  Hot tea or coffee was included but if you want to upgrade to a cold drink they charged $1.50 which was $0.50 more than their competitors."}
{"text":"First visit to the newly opened Woodstone Eatery!  Food: 4/5 - Baked bbq pork cheesy rice was yummy and good portion size.  The bbq pork was good quality and medium fatty. - Curry Beef Brisket rice was a good portion size as well, brisket was tender, but sauce while not bad was also not amazing.  I personally like more fragrant curry, ie: malay curry or coconut curry.  The yellow curry beef brisket at Blue Ocean Cafe is better. - Both came with soup (pumpkin) as part of grand opening  - Nice and modern presentation  Price: 5/5 - Prices for dinner are around the $10 range, very reasonable  Place: 5/5 - Conveniently located, easy parking - Tastefully decorated, modern and new, comfortable seating  Service: 3/5 - Friendly staff - Afternoon tea offered to 6pm, we tried flagging a server over and when we asked for the afternoon tea special it was 5:58pm and after checking with kitchen staff, server confirmed it's no longer available.  I think if it is 6pm on the dot or before, they should honour it, but not a huge deal. - Servers were nice and checked on us a few times - Table next to us complained that the soup was luke warm, our soup came out fine though, so may be a bit of inconsistency here   Overall: enjoyed this meal and will definitely be back to try more menue items!"}
{"text":"I was struggling to think whether to give this a 3 or 4 stars. Came here mainly because I was in the area and wanted to eat baked chicken rice and saw this place newly opened. I've checked the reviews and seem attractive. Came inside and the store is not too big so it maybe busy during lunch hours, but it was not too busy when I visited during dinner time on a weekday. Anyways, you can create your own baked rice by choosing your own sauce and meats and toppings. There is red or green curry sauce that you can pick as your sauce and you can choose brisket or sausage as main meat instead of regular chicken or pork. I've ordered the baked chicken in black pepper on rice and baked chicken in bolognese on rice. They both taste good but the portion is kind of small compare with other places as I can finished all by myself. This is the reason why I am thinking of giving 3 stars but I think the taste should weights more than portion, so I changed to 4 stars instead. Service is good but given it's not busy so I guess that's normal. Overall, I believe I wouldn't mind coming back again for other food on menu."}
{"text":"HK-style food in a rustic chic environment. Service was great and the dishes we tried were all delicious. The options on their menu are a bit more limited than the average HK-style restaurant and prices are definitely higher than most places, but I feel they do make up for these caveats with the quality and presentation of their food.  We had the following:  BBQ pork with fried egg on rice Portuguese chicken with rice Hainanese chicken with rice  Overall the three dishes were tasty and would reorder! Can't wait to come back and try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Love love loved this HK cafe inspired restaurant. The menu items are very classic of a HK Cafe -- baked spaghetti bolognese and curries. There is also a section of the menu where you can customize your meal. They also serve breakfast during a specific time period.   Overall, my impression is good. The HK milk tea was good as was the lemon iced tea. I enjoyed both the service and the food. Great place for friends and families -- even casual dates!   Quick tip, you can pay via credit card if your bill is over $20 (without paying a fee). They do separate bills but pay cash if you don't want to pay a fee for using credit card (if your individual bill is less than $20)."}
{"text":"Newly renovated. Nice decor. \"Younger\" type of background music. Nice that it was loud enough to hear but wasn't over the top loud. Used to be an HK-style cafe, which I frequented. Also used to go to the old Woodstone a couple of units down but this menu is a lot smaller and different. Here seems like a great place to go for a quick lunch. Service was prompt and food came pretty quick.   More \"westernized\" food here. Had the BBQ pork baked rice topped with cheese and tomato-based sauce. Never had that combination before and it worked surprisingly well. Wasn't too heavy but also quite filling. Overall, nothing amazing for the price point but a nice dining experience.  Do have to note that although most of the servers were very polite and attentive, there was one guy that seemed a bit rude and didn't care. Literally slammed the check on our table before we even asked for it. We had a 10% off card. Would have saved us all time if he'd bother checking with us. When alerted, he wasn't really listening and just \"Ok wait\" as he sat a table. Then he forgot, so we flagged another server who quickly adjusted everything and returned within a minute.   Some promos going on: 10% off if you post a photo on Instagram. 10% off card if you went during first couple days of opening.   Overall 3/5. Extra points for nice decor and promos."}
{"text":"the chicken panini was yummy but very filling because of the condensed milk sauce, but overall very yummy.  spaghetti was also good it just tastes like regular spaghetti restaurant is soo beautiful!!! the interior design is so pretty i really like it  i would recommend because the vibe of the restaurant is cool and the food is good"}
{"text":"Spark Notes: There was melted cheese, BBQ pork, delicious sauce, and rice. It was fire. See below for the low down.  The boys and I had just finished up with a marathon workout session, so we were in immediate need of nutrition. Thankfully, the Woodstone Eatery had recently opened up across the street, so the choice was easy.  Woodstone Eatery is a new Asian fusion restaurant around Woodbine & Hwy 7. There is no shortage of Asian restaurants in the area, so props to Woodstone for putting a refreshing and fitting twist on Asian cuisine. The midsize restaurant has decor that presents a lively, modern feel. The creative lighting is a fun touch, and the greenery is well thought out.  After opening up the menu and catching a look at the first rice dish, everyone at the table had pretty much settlled on the cheesy baked BBQ pork on rice, topped with a poached egg, (which turned out to be fried). Although I wanted to make an original decision, the food porn photography was too enticing, and the FOMO was too real. Thank God I didn't try to be creative. It was delicious! In a casserole-esq dish, I was served a bed of white rice topped with large chunks of BBQ pork, a warm tomato sauce, toasted cheese, and a fried egg. When you take your first bite, you'll be reminded of that comforting BBQ pork rice that you can grab from any old Asian restaurant, but Woodstone takes it to a wonderful savoury next level, starting with this tomato sauce. It adds an unexpected sweetness to the dish, and oddly enough, it's reminiscent to ketchup. Depending on your palette you may or may not care for it. I personally think the dish could do with one level less of that flavour, but I was really happy regardless. Oh, and we can't forget the extra dimension of wonderful that you're blessed with once you break that egg yolk.  I also treated myself to an ice coconut macchiato. Being someone who never has added sugar in his normal diet, I really don't care for overly sugary drinks, but they hit the sweet spot (pun absolutely intended) with this drink. The presentation was pleasant, and I really appreciated the drink overall.  All in all, I had a great time. The food was well thought out, delicious, filling, and didn't break the bank. The service wasn't too bad either. I'm sure we'll be back sometime soon to see if the rest of the menu matches up."}
{"text":"I've only been to this plaza for sushi and pool, so it was nice to find another Asian eatery. Visited on a Sunday around 1:00 pm, and it was quite busy. I was in a group of 3 and had seven tables ahead of us. Luckily the wait was not bad as some people ahead left their spots in line. Weird thing is that the \"waiting\" system actually consists of you writing down your name on a lined piece of paper taped near the entrance. If we didn't see other people doing it I'm not sure how much longer that would have added to the wait. Ordered the BBQ pork with fried egg on rice while others others the spaghetti bolognese and the hainan chicken. It felt like I was at a food court with the way the meals were presented on trays. The pork was a bit dry and I wish there had been more cheese baked in. My dish also came warm which was a bit of a letdown.   My mom and I both had upset stomachs after the meal, leading to this rating. For the price and portion (9.99) it is actually a decent value, so maybe there was something with the ingredients that day. Service was alright, but even they admitted that the buzzer system that they have is not always properly attended to. Seating was also a bit cramped throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"The soda drinks were served in mason jar mugs.  The Raspberry Soda was actually quite refreshing with popping bobbas that were very good.  The Pumpkin Soup had bacon bits on it.  It was pretty good and the presentation was super adorable.  The favourite appetizer that night had to be the Macao Cod Fish Potato Ball.  This was a true Macanese dish and the taste was reminiscent to it too.  It was slightly crispy on the outside but the inside was so smooth of cod fish and potato mash.  It was delicious!!  I really liked the Chicken Wings as well.  These were also slightly crispy on the outside and very moist and tender on the inside.  I love tasty chicken wings like these.  The Baked Chicken in Portuguese Sauce on Rice had lots of cheese baked on top of it including olives and sausage slices; very different from usual Hong Kong style baked Portuguese rice dishes.  It was a dish tasting like comfort food to me; it was good!  The Cheesy Baked BBQ Pork on Rice with Fried Egg looked good.  This dish had tomato sauce embedded in it so it was more of an acidic dish in terms of helping you to cut the grease when eating it.  The Signature French Toast was like a Hong Kong style French toast with butter and syrup.  It was pretty good.  The Crème Brûlée was good!  It had that hard caramel glaze and sweet custard underneath.  The custard was dense.  I liked the taste of it.  The Mango Sago actually had lots of fresh mango chunks in it!  It was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Good and quick.  Reasonable prices. Although I bought takeout, I did notice that the ambience is much nicer than restaurants of its kind!"}
{"text":"This newly opened Woodstone is different from their previous: completely different take as it is now a higher end Hong Kong cafe style restaurant. The menu is quite condensed, and they have your typical porkchop with tomato sauce on rice, Portuguese chicken rice, spaghetti bolognaise etc. They also have breakfast and afternoon tea and a handful of vegetarian options.  Food - I come here often because of the convenience of the location (not many hk cafes nearby), but I would give the food 3/5 stars at most. The baked items are rather heavy, though flavourful. I quite enjoy their minced meat with potatoes on rice dish, but a bit too many carbs on one dish lol their afternoon tea options are rather limited, with their piggy bun bread to be slightly hard and inedible sometimes. I do enjoy their grilled chicken with toast and potatoes and egg as a lighter option, but the chicken steak is very small (approximately an actual portion of meat that one should consume lol)  Specific dishes  Curry - 2/5 I find the curry to be watered down, or lack of salt. The beef brisket was nice and tender though.  Whole chicken appetizer - I would give this dish a 4/5. A bit pricy and longer wait but the outcome is a juicy whole chicken with a spicy sauce that makes you want seconds.  BBQ pork - 2/5 wouldn't recommend as it is expensive and nothing special, not worth it  Spaghetti bolognaise - 3/5 a good one, not amazing, but one of their better dishes   Macau style udon with beef - 2/5 felt like eating regular beef brisket with udon, nothing special.  Portuguese chicken rice - 3/5 they added shredded coconut which makes the dish too sweet. They also add olives which gives the dish a good amount of saltiness but the flavours don't mix.  Overall I don't mind the food, but for their price, the portions are slightly smaller than it's competitors in Markham. Customer service is decent, but my orders have been incorrect a few times while I've been there. Food portions are also inconsistent.   I give it 3 stars because of convenience and decent flavours of the dishes."}
{"text":"And the restaurant with the most creative logo goes to...Seriously. It literally reads wood and stone in Chinese and looks like a forest on top of a rock. I love that. It makes me giddy. That's how you know someone really creative decided to take charge.   And creative it is indeed. I wouldn't say this is a HK cafe. If anything, it's like a fusion Macau style cafe with Portuguese and Chinese influences. And more cheese than you'd think you would see in a Chinese place. With dishes like Cheesy Baked BBQ Pork on Rice and Scalded BBQ Pork Belly, how are you not drooling?   I've only come here for lunch. It's really getting popular so you walk in and sign yourself up on the clipboard attached to the door. The first time I came, I felt like they didn't have a lot of variety but things seem to have certainly changed. Some of the things I've tried include:  Baked Black Pepper Chicken on Rice: My favourite dish so far and it may or may not be called \"Africa chicken\" in Chinese, as my parents refer to it as such. Crispy and tender chicken with a spicy peppery gravy resting on a cast iron pan. Delicious.   Hainanese Chicken and Rice: Typical, but tasty.   Curry Portuguese Sardines on Toasted Bun: Here's something interesting you can try if you have no regard for how your breath smells afterwards. The sardines are properly fishy and the curry is reminiscent of a HK curry beef bun but fresh made and fragrant with spices.   Iced Matcha Latte: Weird. It's so weird. Yes, there's proper matcha in it but then they sweeten it with strawberry jam. Literally chunky Smuckers at the bottom of the mason jar. It's extremely pretty but after awhile it feels like you're drinking jam. Not too big a fan of this one.  Very refreshing to have a HK fusion place that is not shy of spicing things up, both figuratively and literally. Woodstone tries new things with new ingredients and while they may or may not work, I definitely welcome the adventurous spirit.   (20/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"A hard place to find something to eat for a pescatarian.  I came for lunch and expected to be able to eat at least a couple of things on the menu.  Sadly, there were barely any options for me to try. There were some things on the brunch menu that were pesce-friendly, but since it was after 11:15, they were no longer available.    I ended up grabbing the popular Bbq Pork dish (basically bbq pork baked in a cheesy rice dish), giving in to momentary weakness.  I took a bite of the pork and decided against eating the pork.  It was fatty and not worth breaking my pescatarian diet.  The rest of the dish was very heavy and cheesy.   I also split the Calamari dish with a friend.   I did not really care for the breading of the squid.   Summary: stay away pescatarians!  Limited selection for you.  All they have is pork and chicken options."}
{"text":"If you want to eat at a place where there's zero customers u should come here. Everytime I come here there is max 2-3 customers. The food here is okay, VERY LIMITED OPTIONS and they are nothing special. The only thing nice here is their fast wifi (cause no one is using it). They definitely need to expand their menu but overall it has a peaceful environment.  ***** they gave us the bill without us requesting for it while we are trying to enjoy our drinks. Like are u trying to kick us out??? ****** 3/5 to 2/5"}
{"text":"most of their foods was a little overpriced, in my opinion. the udon was definitely not worth.. this restaurant really excels in giving their foods extravagant names :'). taste was decent. the portions were leaning to the small side, especially for the pork chop bun. the baked dishes were okay, and the green curry was pretty good (but i forgot to take a photo). the chicken wings were surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast as it is until 11:15. The restaurant looks very pretty inside compared  to typical Chinese restaurants and had a modern and younger vibe to it. They play light casual music inside. After ordering the food came quickly in cute trays   Egg and pork chop vermicelli was just typical didn't have anything special to it came with some random onions. Pork chop was decent. It was a little pricey considering you get a small portion with a drink for $7.75 3/5   Got the beef brisket and instant noodle. The flavour was pretty good but the instant noodles were undercooked and a little hard. I just waited a couple minutes for it to cook in the soup. Doesn't come with a anything else in the bowl but has some green onions and cilantro $7.75 3/5  Overall this place is decent but I wouldn't come back for breakfast again because it was quite expensive but I would try the lunch"}
{"text":"We're a group of friends who have been trying different places for food and have stuck to a rule of at least giving a place 2 chances before making a judgement on any place that we eat at. We have tried most of the menu items in the 2x we were there.  Firstly, this place is very expensive for a very small portion of food. DO NOT get anything tomato based because their tomato sauce is essentially ketchup with some dried parsley.  Service is sub-par and they tried to argue with us about an upgraded drink the 2nd time we went.  The 1st time we went, we ordered the Bolognese, bbq pork, Hainanese chicken and the cheesy bbq pork. Most of these are recommended menu items but I wouldn't even recommend them to anyone.  The 2nd time we went, we went all out knowing there was a chance we may never come back. We \"upgraded\" the drinks, got creme brûlée and ordered the pork bun, Macao chicken (takes 20 minutes), black pepper chicken, brisket noodle, and the curry beef. The food was okay this time around but the service blew my mind. We were charged full price for the drink and then when we asked about it, they tried to tell us that the drink that comes with the meal can't be upgraded to the coconut macchiato. So we asked about getting a drink that comes with the meal since we were charged in full for the other drink anyways. She tried to tell us no, but we corrected her in the fact that we're paying full price for the drink, so we should be getting the drink that comes with the meal. Needless to say, the fact that we have to explain that logic tells me that something is clearly wrong with them.  Not coming back again."}
{"text":"This is a newly opened place replacing an older HK Cafe.   The menu selection is small but they do have some unique dishes to try out.  We went on a weekend right at noon and the place was pretty packed.  They made a lot of mistakes and orders were wrong. I am giving the benefit that they are newly opened.  I had the \"Chef's Special - BBQ Pork with a Fried Egg on Rice\" and it was pretty tasty but the pork was over cooked and very very dry.  I could only eat half of it...  We ordered drinks and only half of them came, and when we flagged down the servers, they kept saying \"Its coming\" - which never came.  No apologies or anything.    I will be back maybe once more in another month and see if it has improved, there are growing pains with new restaurants - we'll see how they are then."}
{"text":"Looks they they totally revamped the \"previous\" Woodstone with new owners.  Totally renovated with more modern and rustic look.   The only thing the same from the \"old\" is the name.  The seating is comfortable and service is very good!  The menu is creative and offers many of the typical HK style items in conjunction to a a few different offerings.     The food is very good and tasty with nothing over/under cooked and is fresh.   Definitely a must try place but you may need wait since there was a small lineup (and this is still a \"new\" place)."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, as my friends live close by and the BF and I come here on occasion when he is craving baked rice. The first time I came here, was with friends and the waitresses are friendly - I once saw them accommodate a family with a small baby and she moved some tables around and suggested where to put the baby chair so the parents could have a better seating experience. A+ for   Food:   The first time I came here, bf ordered their create your own baked dish with rice and I ordered their #42. The portions are above average here as I tend to take home about half the dish (perhaps my stomach has shrunk *cries*) Taste is good, very flavourful though lacking a few vegetables in their dishes. I'm a sucker for spaghetti with meat sauce and this dish came piping hot out of the oven with cheese on top(!) The set dishes come with a choice of hot drink. Their milk tea is well made here :D   Their pork bun was good but for $6.50 I don't feel like it was of value. An above average bun. Pork was seasoned well.   Debit/credit/cash"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Woodstone Eatery for lunch. I tried the Portuguese chicken baked rice and the cod fritters with an iced HK style tea. Love the fusion of HK style cafe and Portuguese food, great selection of unique meals and snacks. Staff were very welcoming and were excellent with going over the menu. Will definitely be returning here and trying their other dishes!"}
{"text":"This HK cafe is quite good I like the decor clean and modern a little more pricy  than your typical HK cha Cheng teng.

{"text":"BBQ pork buns are insanely good.  Try their soup noodles too, I loved their beef brisket noodles."}
{"text":"Hk-style café with a nice and clean feeling as I walked inside..so I found out a few different places that has the \"afternoon tea special\" ends at 5:30 which is a big plus...love working close to home and being able to take advantage of the afternoon special before it ends and just treat it as dinner...getting the best of both worlds..  So my friend and I were in the same boat, we just ordered off the \"afternoon tea special\" as we arrived at 5pm. Ordered literally almost 5 items for 3 adults and 1 child. Instant noodles with luncheon meat and egg has to be the kids favorite thing on the menu with drink, I think it was like $7.25 or something, we also ordered chicken wings, beef brisket noodles, French toast and our bill ending up coming to roughly about $50ish which I would have to say, not bad for filling everyone up for that kind of price in this day and age...  The milk tea is on the spot, you have to order that, the balance of milk and tea is just right...I would definitely say they top it for most of the other HK style cafes...  All in All, a place I will come back for afternoon tea and treat it as dinner...no doubts, but and questions!!!"}
{"text":"Fairly good service with typical HK style good. Nothing particularly special about the place but the decor is nice and the staff are friendly ."}
{"text":"HK style cafe with modern menu and atmosphere but above average price in an area with plentiful HK style cafes. I got the brisket curry with rice $9.99: was OK,...but the sauce was a little gelatinous. Also got the baked tomato sauce pork chop rice for $10.50 and they only gave like 5 bite-sized pieces of pre-cut pork chop. They each came with drinks and we got cold milk tea (+$1.50 each) which also adds up. The service was a bit slow due to high school students walking over from a nearby school for lunch.. and when I asked for our drinks to come because I was in a rush and we had already finished eating, the reply was 'I know'. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I came here before when it was called HK Style Cafe. I really liked the new decor, feels warmer and they accept cards now too!  I went in just before the lunch hr rush and got seated promptly with warm greetings from the server. The menu is simple (not sure if it's a different one for dinner). Each main dish comes with a drink. I love my HK style milk tea! This one was pretty smooth and not as thick as some others I've had.   I was going to order the Chef's special baked BBQ pork on rice with fried egg but I was told there's no cheese and less sauce so I went with the Baked BBQ pork with cheese and poached egg. It seems like it's a favorite among yelpers too. I wanted sth different, instead of my usual baked spaghetti or baked pork chop. I surprisingly enjoyed it. the BBQ pork are thick cut, very tender and the tomato sauce is the one used for baked pork chop dishes. It wasn't overwhelming with cheese because I mentioned it during ordering. The server may have said sth which is nice! The egg is not poached at all...I think that should be changed on the menu.   The menu features a page of small bites/started-sized items like okra. I would definitely come back to try them during dinner or go with more people to try some of these. They also feature  a light menu for afternoon snacks with a drink included. Reasonable prices...around $5.99 to start."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch. We're always down to try new CCTs! :D  Woodstone Eatery gets 3.5 / 5 stars. The interior of the place is modern and clean. Service was just ok - they kept forgetting to give us the menu and utensils. The place was pretty packed, I believe most people are here to try this new restaurant out. Be prepared to wait 10-15 mins for a table. We were lucky to get a table right away because someone just left as we arrived.  DRINKS:  * ICED LEMON TEA (2/5) This was pretty watered down..  * CHEESY BAKED BBQ PORK ON RICE (3.5/5) (with poached egg on top, but my egg was over cooked so it wasn't poached haha) I ordered this because it was one of the most recommended items on the menu. I liked it!! The cha siu (barbecued pork) was very sweet and came in large chunks. I liked how much sauce was drenched in the rice - #saucebause. I would've given this dish a 4/5 if they added more cheese.   * SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE  My boyfriend ordered this dish and said it was pretty delicious. He said that he would choose my choice over his though. I tried some of the spaghetti and thought it needed more flavour.  I'd come back to try other items on the menu :)"}
{"text":"We came for a quick lunch and made reservations. They gave us a much smaller table with insufficient seating, so we ended up having to cram in. Two of us actually just asked for our meals to go since it was taking too long and definitely not comfortable. They did have other tables available but they rather save those for 2 seat-ers rather than give to a bigger table.. defeats the purpose of calling in ahead to reserve a comfortable table for lunch I suppose.  The food was alright. It was HK Cafe style food that they kinda one-up making it a little fancier. Portion wise, it's perfect for someone like me who can't eat much, but rather small in comparison to other HK Cafes who are charging the same or less. This place was a bit more pricey and honestly, I would rather just go to a regular HK Cafe where the portions are great and the food is simple.   If you come by for a visit, I would recommend the baked spaghetti with tomato and meat sauce. Its a bit more acidic so the sauce with the pasta actually tasted pretty bright and I would be likely to order that again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Baked Portuguese Chicken Rice - Decent taste and appearance, but nothing remarkable given there are literally a hundred restaurants in the neighborhood that can do the same thing, and better.  What really TRIGGERED me about this place was when I was paying for my bill at the cashier, an older gentleman whispered Cantonese into the waitress's ear, thinking I could not understand.  He told her, \"Don't let him look, charge him extra.\"  Sure enough, when I was passed the payment terminal, the total was higher than what was on my bill. When I asked about it (In English), she told me it was a 25 cent transaction fee.  However, simple arithmetic revealed it was in fact 29 cents. When I asked about this too, they claimed it was tax. Tax on a debit transaction fee? Did I just get double ripped-off?  Suffice to say, the extra charge is minor, but the dishonesty is costly.  Please avoid this place."}
{"text":"Just another Hk style restaurant.  Food is not that great. Hainanese chicken was tasteless and the rice filled with food colouring and no taste as well. Other rice dishes we tried were too much sauce. Won't come back for sure."}
{"text":"Been here several times already for breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner. Breakfast has some western items (toast/eggs/homefries) and some typical Hk cafe items (eg Spam with fried egg on vermicelli, pork bun sandwich). Afternoon tea menu has some of the morning selections as well.   I'm usually not a huge fan of Chinese style Portuguese sauce anything, but their Portuguese curry fish on bun was so fragrant and tasty. Though not as fluffy as the buns in Macau, Woodstone's buns are soft and chewy enough compared to Macau style buns at other cafes.   The beef brisket here is so tender and has flavour, unlike many other HK cafe. Totally worth getting as well for breakfast or afternoon tea.   Their BBQ pork (char siu) in tomato sauce and melted cheese with a fried egg on top was amazing. The tangy and sweet flavours of the tomato BBQ sauce with the egg yolk mixed in was perfect on a bed of steamed rice.   Their milk tea is served in cups larger than most other HK cafe cups. The milk and tea combination is just right. Trust, I have tried enough milk tea in GTA - some tastes like brown coloured evaporated milk, some tastes like watered down tea, some tastes way too bitter. I like their hot milk tea, but I don't think I would order their iced milk tea again because from the granules I saw at the bottom of my cup, their iced versions seemed to have been prepared from instant milk tea powder instead! :(   The price is a bit on the higher side but the seating environment is comfortable. The servers are friendly but slightly on the slower side (never got around to refilling our empty cups - when it's a hot day and you're pregnant, you'd want a constant water supply!) The seating area is clean but they really could spend a bit more work with the washroom - the floors were sticky and somewhat wet even around 10am in the morning.   Despite these little areas for improvement, I'd say I will keep coming back for the good!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. We came at lunch time, & were keep being pushed to pay the bill even though we were there only for near half an hour. Won't come again."}
{"text":"We ordered the #19 and #15 - it was pretty good. However, I felt a bit guilty since it's really rice + sauce + meat. There was a bit too much sauce + rice for my liking.    Would like to try their curry and Hainan chicken next time :)   Overall a nice aesthetically pleasing place. Would not recommend people to come for large events- since it's a quick meal / loud.  They messed up on orders a few times. You would see items get sent to the wrong table / orders coming in twice. But they are still a new restaurant so it's a learning process for them too !"}
{"text":"A bit on the pricier side compared to the other hk style cafe - you are definitely paying for the decor. The seating is comfortable and the parking is good. They had a 10% discount if you post a picture of their food on social media, but the discount does not work on the afternoon tea special. I got the chicken bun - bread was a bit thicker than I would've like but otherwise it was juicy and flavorful, although I think a little bit of sauce would've made it better. The pork chop rice was alright - my bf commented that the sauce tasted like the tomato rice at Richmond Court. The piece of pork chop was quite thin. I agree with the other reviews that the milk tea was a bit weak."}
{"text":"I find it hard to not compare Woodstone Eatery to the previous establishment that was here, as they are quite similar in the sense that they were both HK Style cafes. Though Woodstone Eatery seems to have renovated and are aiming for a more upper end HK style cafe along with a similar price point.  Having said that, for the price, decor and selection of items I would say Woodstone Eatery does a good job.   They had some slightly unique menu items that you would not see on a typical HK style cafe (wood fungus salad, and even italian sodas??), but also have the more common items with a slight twist. This being a choose your own \"baked dish\".   You can select your carb base, sauce and main and anything else on top. I found the rice, green curry with beef brisket was quite satisfying. On my second trip here I tried the same combo with sweet potato fries though, and the amount of sweet potato fries was just down right sad. I had maybe 8 soggy fries total. Im willing to give the benefit of the doubt that this was an abiration, and will be back again when in the area.  Generally a good experience, which will lead me back again"}
{"text":"This is basically your average Hong Kong style cafe. From the food, service, and setting, to me it all suggest that this is a HK cafe. No matter how hard it tries to be something else, it is what it is. Don't get me wrong, it's not necessarily a bad thing. HK Cafe is great to grab a tasty quick bite \"economically\".  So as soon as I was seated, I have establish that this is a HK Cafe. I am a little shock that the prices on the menu suggest otherwise. $10.50 for hainanese chicken rice, and $9.50 for beef brisket with udon in soup! Ok, I am expecting something spectacular coming onto my table for sure. Guess what, it's not much different than what 10 other HK cafe is offering along Hwy 7. It's not bad, the hainanese chicken and rice is flavourful and fragrant. The brisket udon is decent. The hainan chicken should be $8, and udon should be $7. It's come with only the regular lemon tea or water drinks, no soups, desserts or bread to justify the price either.  In summary, it's good but overprice!  Taste **** Price * Portion **"}
{"text":"Blends together a traditional Hong Kong style cafe with the rustic modern style. The food selection is not as wide as you may find in the traditional HK cafe but the dishes are different and not something you can find in most places.  I had the Cheesy pork rice which was alright.  Good place for a local eat and moderate pricing.  Staff is a bit fresh (ordered milk tea and came back coffee twice), but was friendly.   Offered discount if customer posts about the restaurant on social media (i.e. twitter, instagram, facebook... )  All in all the environment wins top marks but the food and service may have to catch up a bit."}
{"text":"This name was opened in the same plaza years ago.  It was pretty good!  Give them a try since they reopen with the same name.  Totally different than b4, small menu, taste ok but the portion size way too small.  Small lady size, don't go there if you expected good size noodles and rice with a good price.  The meat sauce and tomato sauce are too sweet.  Over price with small protion!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Not as good as the original Woodstone and pretty far down the list as far as Chinese eateries in Markham go. The menu is really limited, and they're really inflexible to adjustments. The HK milk tea also fluctuates quite a bit in quality, it's like the water it down when there's too many people. Their service is also quite slow and they kept getting our order wrong.  I hope they go back to their old model."}
{"text":"I came here for afternoon tea and was excited given Woodstone was a go-to place at the old location a few years ago. This re-opened restaurant was nicely renovated with booth seating. The menu offers an abundance of Asian fusion food choices. We opted for the classic french toast, beef brisket in vermicelli and the pork chop breakfast meal. My dad found the noodle portion to be very little and was quite disappointed given the meal was more expensive than other HK style places. The french toast was average and did not come with peanut butter as some other places offer. As for the pork chop meal, it wasn't bad but once again, small portion for what you are paying for. Overall, don't think I will be coming again. Service was also not great."}
{"text":"Excited about some of their famous dishes from Macau, being Macanese myself. I went there the next day after seeing a few amazing posts on Instagram.   I was impressed by their food quality and service. They were also transparent about preparation time for some of the dishes.   I had the Macanese Spiced chicken and my husband had the Hainese Chicken. Both were thoroughly marinated and very tasty. i thought the Spiced chicken had too much pepper in it but hubby loved it. This dish actually brought nack memories from growing up in Macau- so I give them two thumbs up.   The only disappointment was their serradura dessert because ot their lack of biscuit crumbs. Will definitely go back to try other itme on their menu!"}
{"text":"Friendly service but slow and not proactive enough. Guess they still need time to ramp up to speed as they are so new. Menu has good selection.  It is all in English so granny couldn't order for herself.  Nice cutlery and  crockery.  Soup is good.  HK style milk tea is totally NOT up to par,  too thin and not flavourful.  Hainan chicken is boneless, which is a nice surprise, but the chicken is too soft,  probably not free range. The baked rice with grilled pork topped with egg and cheese is very interesting and flavourful, but the sauce is a little too ketchuppy,  which is unusual for grilled pork, which usually comes with teriyaki.  Will give this place some more time to settle form and try them again."}
{"text":"3.5  Pros: Interesting take on HK style cafe cuisine Nice Decor  Cons: Not much variety in menu  If Woodstone Eatery had just popped up on it's own somewhere, I feel it would of been better reviewed than it has been so far.  Unfortunately, it took over what was a very popular HK style cafe that had a lot of variety in it's menu.  When this place was HK style cafe, I came here a lot.  They had an vast menu with a lot to choose from.  They had daily specials which were included a drink and were very well priced as well.  Woodstone has replaced that with specific unique dishes at the cost of variety.  For me, that doesn't translate to well.  As per all the reviews before me, I had to try the baked BBQ pork on rice with cheese.  This dish is everything everyone says about it.  It's a very well prepared dish with a twist on when you usually expect.  It's got a good amount of melted cheese which is something I like.  It's also a bit on that tangy side which I didn't like as much.  I'm someone who doesn't like to mix my sweet and savoury flavours.  My wife had a pork chop on a bun which was well done as well.  For me it was a bit smaller side but I'm a big eater.  My wife felt it was good enough for her.  We got some fries and chicken wings for my little one.  They were your standard wings and fries, no more no less.  I know my review is heavily influenced based on what the previous business was.  I think it's a fair comparison though when it's kind of the same types of business.  If it became an Italian restaurant, then I would of reviewed it differently.  I'm OK with Woodstone's take on a HK style cafe, just not at the expense of the variety it used to have."}
{"text":"Glad to have tried this HK style place. The bbq pork is really tender and juicy. Taste just right. Also ordered the beef noodle soup and love how the meat was cooked just right. Hainan chicken rice is superb. Enjoyed everything we ordered.  Place is small but clean. Very relaxing place."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times but today I came in early to try their breakfast menu.   The place was quiet with classical songs in the background. It really sets the mood for a relaxing start of the day.  Hong Kong cafes tend to be busy during breakfast and it gets noisy. This place is fairly new and maybe it has not been discovered by the predominantly Chinese residents.   The menu had the regular eggs, potatoes, porkchop and buns typical Chinese breakfast. If you are looking for the instant noodle soup option, they don't have it on their breakfast menu. They have paninis and French toast.   I tried the Curry Portuguese Sardine on a ToastedBun with Side Salad. The salad on the side made it feel fancy. I am overly satisfied with everything. The spiciness is just right ( no runny nose) and the 2 strawberries from the salad balances it out. The salad is light and tasty. Slices of almonds on top added some crunchiness to it. Which also means that if you are allergic to nuts, you have to let them know. I love red onions on salad, yum!  All breakfast comes with coffee or tea.   Cost $6.50. This is better than My regular Eggsmart's $4.99 3 eggs and greasy ham/sausage and $2+ coffee weekday specials.  Free wifi is a bonus, it lets me check on my work emails easily.   The owner is very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. I first discovered Woodstone Eatery through Yelp, and had it bookmarked for a while. Despite the average ratings and bad reviews - I decided to give this place a try! This restaurant is located in a convenient spot for me - close to my work and home; thus, I REALLY wanted to like it. Plus I love Asian Fusion/HK style restaurants! But this place? There is no way I am returning (unless they make some serious changes).   My issue is with the service. First of all, the waiter who took our order was very dismissive throughout our entire meal. While we were asking about the menu items, he seemed like he was in a rush. I let that go. Then our drinks came, and our appetizer + MY main meal came shortly afterwards. After that, we proceeded to wait another 15-20 minutes for my partner's meal to come out. How does that make sense? By the time his meal came, I was pretty much already done eating mine. I understand certain dishes may take longer to make in the kitchen, but at least sync up the timing for our main dishes, so 1/2 guests wouldn't be eating by themselves... But that wasn't the most frustrating part. It was the fact our waiter knew we were waiting for a while, and ignored our attempts at getting his attention. I kept catching him looking at us, then he would look away or do something else as soon as he sees me looking back at him. He was intentionally ignoring us! No joke. Once my partner got his meal, he started eating while I was just sitting there doing nothing (I was full from my meal as I was eating without him). Then when he was finished eating and ready to pack up, we had asked our waiter to bring take out boxes for us and to bring the bill. He only brought us the boxes and not the bill - not really sure why, maybe he was planning on waiting for us to finish packing the food before he brought the bill or something? But nope, even that was wrong for me to assume. Because after we finished packing our food and were clearly DONE and READY to leave, he continued to glance at us then would just go the opposite direction or look away! We were just so confused! I even saw him print out our bill and left it on the side table for a good chunk of time FOR NO REASON. We were sitting at our tables with everything cleared and packed, just looking at him and waiting. He was steps away from us and so was the bill he had put to the side. He wasn't even occupied with anything else, and we had made eye contact several times. So in he end, I had to flag down another waitress and get her to bring us the bill. Such an unbelievable dining experience. We were friendly customers and did not deserve that random rude encounter from the waiter. Unfortunately we did not leave a tip because I do not think we received proper service. Also, another thing to note is that it was NOT busy during the time we went for dinner. There were several empty tables in their small restaurant, so I have no idea what his excuse would be.   The only positive aspect about this restaurant is the design. Interior space is clean and nicely decorated/trendy, matching with their menu. The menu is nicely designed and the food options are also pretty decent. But there are many restaurants with delicious food in the GTA, that also have good service. Woodstone's food does not stand out enough for me to \"ignore\" the bad service. Sorry."}
{"text":"Food was good. My boyfriend kept on saying #19 tastes like the food he had when he was a child. \"Childhood taste\". And the Hainan chicken was decent as well. Suggestions: perhaps a bit more choices on menu. The environment was decent as well. Will come back and recommend."}
{"text":"The best thing about not \"expecting\" is a place gets a chance to exceed expectations.  I got an exemplary taste of what I thought was an average Hongkese meal . I had ordered the Hainese Chicken which I would recommend to anyone. The chicken tasted light yet savoury a perfect compliment to a tasty fried rice that the meal came with. The thickly sliced Barbecue pork was surprisingly tender to the bite that our picky eater son chomped on it. A must try is their BBQ topped with Fried Egg, which also came with a cheese sauce, its the picture you see on their menu. This is something new to our palate which we don't mind to order again.   The interior and decor outdid others in the same category. It was simple modern chic and importantly clean. The menu choices are not the same as what other offers . What I meant by that statement is that it does not have Spam, Egg and Rice / Bread on the menu. They actually have some pretty decent choices albeit smaller compared to other Honkong cafe restaurants I've visited."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new Asian Fusion Cafe.  Came here today for lunch for the first time.   The atmosphere was quite nice with comfortable booth seatings.  I can tell that the owner put a lot of thought in designing the menu.  I got the #42 Cheesy Baked BBQ Pork Fried Egg on rice which had a really tasty tomato sauce with lots of meats for only $10.99 which includes hot coffee or milk tea.  My husband got the \"build your own bowl\" and he picked the BBQ Pork as well with Portuguese sauce on rice for $9.99.   Both dishes were pretty good but my dish was definitely tastier.  We were in a bit of a rush and I only read up on their story that the owners were inspired by their father's restaurant in Macao after we ordered.   Macao is famous for their deep fried pork chop on bun which  I'm sure that they probably do it well.  We'll have to come back to try#35 famous pork chop on toasted bun - only $6.50."}
{"text":"This restaurant has now become one of my favourite hk style restaurants in Markham so far. Although it wasn't that good when they first opened couple months ago, my overall experience now is pretty good and actually above average I would say. Their location is pretty convenient, located at hwy 7 and woodbine which is pretty close from highway.   Food wise, their braised pork has always been my number one dish and I mostly only order this dish. The pork was not hard as rock but soft and tender with adequate chewiness. And the sauce that comes with it was not too salty or sweet but right at the middle.   I also ordered their lamb curry rice but unfortunately it didn't match my expectation. It wasn't spicy enough and the portion of the lamb was a bit too small compare to the rice underneath. However, the sauce on top of it was pretty good, not too sour or sweet but I won't order this dish again for sure when I come next time.   Service wise, because the time I went wasn't lunch or dinner time so there were many empty spots and the servers could take our order right away and the food came out pretty fast too. I'm not sure if that's because the timing we went wasn't too busy or it has always been this way. But my overall experience with the service and food were above average."}
{"text":"This place seemed to have switched owners and reopened with a new English name, but kept the same chinese name of the restaurant. They simplified the menu with a lot less options, kinda good cause they are more focused on foods that they are specialized, such as their baked rice. I like the food descriptions on their menu - they are in chinese, but if you can read them they are pretty jokes, Kinda hard selling their food items in an exaggerated way.  Baked porkchop in tomato sauce ($9.99) This tasted good but nothing special to be honest. Typical pork chop served with tomato sauce.   Cheesy baked BBQ pork on rice topped with a poached egg ($10.99) The BBQ pork was good but typical and nothing special. The egg was not poached, totally over done. Not sure the cheese really complemented the bbq pork.   Braised beef brisket on a bun ($8.50) This was really tasty. It was chopped up beef brisket pieces sandwiched in melted cheese. The beef meat was tender and the sandwich was really flavorfu. This was probably the best dish at our visit.   Overall food was alright. I came here for lunch on the weekend so not sure if it's cause they were busy and still being opened not long ago so not getting the hang of it? Service was slow, and when they served the baked rice the temperature was just warm not hot."}
{"text":"Woodstone was eh. I came here for dinner and had a build your own bowl with udon, portuguese sauce, and pork. A bit too cheesy which made it extremely filling and it was..ok. The interior looks nice though.I may or may not come back. We will see."}
{"text":"Another one with extremely bad service.   Named after the now defunct Woodstone Eatery, the restaurant opens at the location where Hong Kong Cafe used to be. The food is decent but nothing special making the overall price value proposition to be worse than expected. Couple that with bad service (literally took them 40 minutes for me to receive my tea although my friend's tea was served inmediately). When asked where my tea is, the answer was \"we're busy\". Also when we paid, they short changed us by $5.   Never again. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for my first visit. I really like the decor which was nicer than most HK style cafes. Came here for breakfast but the menu seems to have other promising dishes at reasonable prices. I tried the pork chop bun as well as the grilled chicken bun. Both came with the same toasted bun and side salad. I really liked the bun which was a chewy baguette toasted very lightly, but the chicken and pork chop didn't taste too different. The salad was nice, with a sweet tangy dressing and had some strawberries, dried cranberries, walnuts and almonds among the greens. Overall a good experience and would come back to try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Woodstone Eatery is one of the \"fancier\" Hong Kong Style Restaurant that have been opening up in the Markham/Richmond Hill area.  Usually HK Style Cafe usually means value and big portion, if you expect that here, you will be disappointed.   I have to say the ingredients is fresher and better grades. Portion size is way smaller. I usually cannot finish a set meal and have some leftover to take home but here I could.   I tried a few of their baked rice dish which were A-OK (just because those are the few one tne menu that comes with a drink). I do highly recommend their chicken wing basket.  Menu is small but I think it is better that they work on quality of their dish vs quantities.  Might come back for a visit but it is not going to be my go to place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch this time. Ordered Hainanese chicken on rice and baked fish fillet w bacon (+1.25 extra topping) on fried rice with Bolognese sauce (+1.25). Satisfied with both."}
{"text":"I like my first visit at Woodstone Eatery a lot.  I ordered a Portuguese Chicken Baked Rice ($10), and my coworker ordered a Black Pepper Chicken Baked Rice ($10) for lunch.  The Portuguese Chicken Baked Rice looked good, and it tasted good, too.  There was lot of chicken, lot of rice and sufficient sauce to go with it.  It could be salty for some, but I liked salt, so I didn't mind. The Black Pepper Baked Rice looked okay, because the black pepper gave the sauce a dark/greyish colour. The coworker said it only tasted okay.  The portion of both baked rices was sufficient.  Both my coworker and I had a small leftover to pack home.  Coworker also ordered a cold beverage that was so pretty looking.  It was delicious and refreshing.  Services was sufficient for a lunch. The server was effective and polite.  The food arrived in reasonable time for a lunch rush.  Interior decoration is nice.  The venue is pretty enough to be a drink and relax place if it is quiet."}
{"text":"If you're expecting a cha chaan teng that's more of a value meal, then I can see why this place would be 3 stars because while I think the prices are reasonable, the portion you get compared to other HK cafes is smaller (i.e. Phoenix, New City).   But personally, I thought that it was worth because of the quality ingredients and presentation of their dish. It's also a plus that it's really spacious, clean, and nicely decorated - it's more of my ideal environment to dine as opposed to the hustle and bustle of a loud, classic CCT.  Even with the place packed with people on Sunday at 1:30pm, I felt very comfortable in my own space. The menu does offer variety - wings, sandwiches, rice dishes, curry, lo mien/udon, etc. Their specialty is their baked rice/spaghetti and I loved that they offer to build your own starting at $9.99.   ~ Baked Black Pepper Chicken on Rice $9.99 (5/5): My boyfriend ordered this dish and it was really delicious. Just enough sauce, very flavourful, chicken was juicy. It's marked with a spicy icon on the menu and it wasn't spicy at all (he has like zero spice tolerance).  ~ DIY: Baked Bolognese Spaghetti with Pork Chop $10.99 (3.5/5): I opted to assemble my own cause I love bolognese sauce but I wanted to pick my own protein. The spaghetti was cooked al dente the way I like it and they were very generous with the sauce but the taste was pretty average. I think it's a safe choice for anyone else who likes bolognese too but it was a bit bland for me and I would probably won't reorder. The pork chop was a little dry for me so I would probably recommend going with they chicken or bbq pork next time.  I'll definitely be back again to try some of their other menu items - the Macao's Famous Spicy BBQ Chicken Steak with potatoes looks really good!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Woodstone's eatery after seeing pictures of the food online and seeing it under the \"Hot and New\" section of Yelp. I was excited to try it since I love baked rice dishes and went in with high hopes (I know this is a big no no... But I couldn't help it). We went on a Saturday night at 8pm and there was no line but seeing as it just opened up recently, it was not surprising.   The ambiance of the place really suited me. I noticed that each wall was made up of different material (eg. Brick, wood, tile, etc) and the middle section had plants layed out so it gave off a cafe vibe. The lighting fixtures were also well placed and wasn't too bright or dark for my liking.   Like other yelpers said, the menu selection is relatively limited but my party and I all opted for the baked rice dishes. I ordered the 'Black Pepper chicken' and also got to try the 'Portugese chicken' and the popular 'BBQ pork with egg'. We also ordered drinks that came with the dish; two iced lemon teas and one iced HK milk tea.   Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed with the food. The chicken itself was moist and tender but the sauce of the black pepper chicken was a bit salty for my liking. The sauce on the BBQ pork apparently didn't really go well with the pork itself. The Portugese chicken was the winner of the three dishes we ordered. Drink wise, the milk tea was your typical milk tea drink but the lemon tea was watered down.   I didn't experience bad service like other yelpers had. Each table has a device that allows you to call for a server and they were quick to respond.   Overall, I'm glad I tried Woodstone's eatery. The place itself was decorated to the tee and it was very lively with the grand opening since a lot of families were visiting the owners and congratulating them on their reopen. While the food did somewhat disappoint, I may have it another try next time I'm in Markham."}
{"text":"Tried the beef brisket udon & the baked pork chop rice with ketchup sauce. I love the beef brisket udon. I like udon to begin with, but the brisket is tender and flavourful. However, the pork chop rice has nth special. It is around ~$10 each. Will prob come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I really wanna like this place, but it is... eh. They do a lot of things right, but a lot of things wrong as well.   The good: the interior and aesthetics is A+. It has that Asian modern vibe where there are FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS OF WALLS. Wood, stone, regular wall, etc. Writing that also just blew my mind.... \"WOOD STONE\" EATERY. wow. my aesthetic meter was tingling. The plates were metal which kind of reminded us of a jail, but they were pretty cute lmfao.   Menu was interesting.... it only consisted of 4 pages really. Appetizers, drinks, noodles and rices/pastas. The only \"viable\" page in my opinion was the rices/pastas page. I opted for the spaghetti with chicken in it which was $11.99. I think it was definitely pricey for what was given. If this was 9.99 then I'd be less mad. The \"regular\" spaghetti did not have meat in it and I think it should just come with it as it feels incomplete. It tasted good, but was it mind blowing? No.   Our server was not good at all lol. Dude's personality was not fit for this kind of job. We had a different good server before but he disappeared and never came back, leaving us with this guy.   3/5. Menu was limited, food was average, service is eh. I'd maybe come back again, but I'd rather go down South to Hollywood Cafe."}
{"text":"Rate this 3.5, but can't do half stars. So round up to a 4.   The photos I have are from two different visits. Walking into the restaurant, it's much more modern than other restaurants, borderline hipster. It's always quite busy as it is still quite new. The retardant is not too big, not good for big groups.   My first visit I had the baked rice, and it definitely came out real quick. The portions are actually quite filling. The bbq pork they used are similar to Japan's char siu, and so  it's a tad sweeter. The rice for the baked rice, is not fried. Normally other HK styled places would have fried rice for their baked rice.   The second time, I came not as hungry so we ordered the regular bbq pork with rice and also wings on the side. The wings are freshly made, so they take the longest to come out. Wings are really nothing special, at least the honey garlic one anyway.   The prices to me are a bit higher than expected. Definitely the crowd here is a bit younger compare to other HK style restaurants.   Reason for the 3.5 is the prices, and the seating is not that comfortable as it is quite tight."}
