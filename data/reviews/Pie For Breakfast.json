{"text":"This place is so good!!! Everything tastes like genuine home cooked food. I got the four sides and all of them were great, especially the mashed potatoes and greens. I had a chocolate chip cookie and oat milk latte for dessert. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was good.  Pies for breakfast, not so much, 3 pies that were so so.  Have had much better pies in many other locations. Was kind of expensive for amount of food as well, but my major concern was the lack of pie selection and lack of excellence in flavors."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to eating at Pie for Breakfast.  But I was seriously disappointed.  First of all the noise level is incredible.  We could not hold a conversation, It was very warm.  Albeit, it was hot outside.  The food was average, at best.  I had eggs and a pancake.  The pancake was tough, eggs were fine, not anything special.  We had pie at the end of the meal which was the high point. Hope that they improve.  It's a good location in Oakland."}
{"text":"It was wonderful. I think we went on the day of the grand opening. The place was crowded but the service was warm and friendly. My son had eggs, home fries, cottage bacon and home made bread/toast. The bacon was special as was the home made bread/toast. The eggs were buttery and delicious. I had the salad with house made vinaigrette. It had mixed greens, asparagus and lentils. The asparagus was perfectly cooked. I added the arctic char on top which again was well cooked with a crispy skin. All in all a wonderful lunch. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Like their food, but on average we waited 30mins to be seated, and 40mins to serve our food. There's not even that many people ahead of us."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to be open since 2017!! I live in the area and I can't tell you how many people have been anticipating PFB's opening.

VINEGAR PIE ($4.50): By the name, you'd think it would taste bad. Surprisingly good. Imagine an apple pie, without the apple part but just the glaze from the apples and that as the whole pie, that's what this tasted like to me! Not bad not bad! But too sweet for me.
RHUBARB PIE ($4.50): Very good also. Can't compare it to the vinegar pie because they're pretty different. This one was a bit tangy and not super sweet so like a palate cleanser from the vinegar pie.
CHOPPED LAMB STEAK W/ RHUBARB CHUTNEY ($12): I thought it would be an actual lamb steak but this was more like a meat loaf. Rhubarb chutney was good. Compare it to a cranberry sauce!
My 3 sides were: cornbread, braised greens, and mashed potatoes!

Prices are decent for dinner! Decor is interesting, there are a bunch of mirrors on the wall. I want to come back, but for the breakfast/brunch because I wasn't all for the soft opening dinner menu."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious. They have vegetarian mushroom gravy & biscuits. The pie isn't vegetarian. Chocolate chips are vegetarian. Very fun atmosphere, a little wait, but it wasn't too bad. They haven't finalized the menu yet, but are supposed to soon. 

They aren't on no wait, but are looking into it."}
{"text":"Best food place to eat breakfast, loved the pancakes. The only real issue I have with the place is noise. Serice was excellent and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I got the omelette with Swiss, asparagus, and ham and it was okay but definitely not the best it could be for $10. The salt rising bread toast was a single piece of toast which was kind of small from what I had imagined prior. The omelette tasted very buttery and the toast was also covered in butter. The omelette was tasty but I think there was a bit too much butter. They seem to be a little stingy on their serving sizes; my friend ordered the two eggs, toast, and potatoes breakfast and there were very little potatoes and a single slice of toast. The toast wasn't bad, it was pretty dense and nicely toasted. However, overall I thought it was slightly overpriced for the quantity of food they gave us. Also, i asked if i could substitute my Swiss cheese with any other cheese and they said they only had Swiss available (surprised about this!) But, my other friend got the buttermilk pancakes and they were really delicious--light, fluffy, and tasty! I think out of the 3 different meals at the table, the pancakes were the best."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  The omelet was outstanding and the cookie was also really tasty.  I didn't give them 5 stars because it was loud.  It was packed and sounds really carries in there so it was hard to have a conversation.  I'll be back to try their pie though!"}
{"text":"What a great little place!  I wish I lived in Pittsburgh so I could visit it frequently.  

However, I found myself having breakfast there. It's quirky, with a clean and modern look.  It's comfortable and the service was friendly, attentive and informed.  But the food was the thing.  

I had the Buttermilk Pancakes, with real maple syrup and a side of bacon.  The cakes were unusually flavorful, tasty, hot and fresh. The bacon was meaty.  The latte was delicious.  My dining companion had the Rhubarb Pie, which also was surprising in its subtly delicious tastiness. It wasn't too sweet, just enough, while definitely being scrumptiously pie-ish.  Words fail, apparently, when confronted with actual flavorful food. There were a bunch of other interesting options that i bet would be great too - choices that intrigued.  I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Definitely going to be my new go-to place! I came for dinner on opening day and opted for 4 different sides: mashed potatoes, broccoli, cornbread muffin, and black eyed peas. All were delicious and tasted just like home! Seriously-the mashed potatoes tasted exactly like my grandmas. 

Service was awesome too. Everyone kept checking in on us since it was opening day. For dessert I went for the lemon-rose cookie and coffee. Yum! The cookie was so fluffy and delicious. Can't say enough good things about this place. Cannot wait to come back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Slow service, probably because it's a new place. Had the home fries which were good. Sausage was not great. Pretty limited menu, nothing really too special."}
{"text":"So thankful for this new after work spot. Dinner/drinks till 9pm most days is perfect. Great place to stop after work before heading home. Tables booths and a nice high top bar with stools.  Good music, but not too loud, great place for conversation.  Food is fresh and comforting.  Great basic bar with top shelf and prosecco on tap.  I def would recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food at this location spelled out one idea to me... It was trying too hard. It offered coffee like a sit down coffee joint, and it offered alcohol like a bar... But it seemed like three different locations in one place. While this could work, I felt no balance, and the place itself seemed too small to offer that many services. I sat next to other patrons with about an inch between our tables, and the menu that day said that it was shortened on that specific day.
My party ordered two dishes... The biscuits and gravy and a very complex omelette. The omelette was expensive... I believe it was 12 dollars on its own for a small omellete and one piece of their special toast... But the toast was so burnt, all I could taste was the rock hard burnt nature of it. The omelette itself was overwhelming... Grier, an incredibly overpowering pesto, and asparagus... Several unique, and delicious sounding, but overwhelming ingredients. Ultimately, all it tasted like was pesto. It reminded me of these modern, new wave restaurants that feature specialized and crafted recipes.
On the other hand, we also ordered the biscuits and gravy... They were so simplistic it was bland. Dense, heavy biscuits in a gravy that was unseasoned or at least underseasoned and the sauce itself was more of a liquid than a thick gravy.
To me... After that intense, specialized omelette, I would expect the other dishes to have the same feeling... But the other dish we tasted was immensely unimpressive."}
{"text":"I stopped by for dinner during their soft opening this evening and I was quite impressed... I sat at the bar where Dillon waited on me immediately while providing pleasant conversation. I asked for an Arnold Palmer and although this beverage was not on their list of offerings, Dillon mixed one per my request. I ordered \"comfort food\" - two 4 oz. Pork Chops with Stewed Rhubarb along with three sides - Mashed Potatoes, Black-Eyed Peas and Rice Pilaf. The dinner was delivered quickly and my meal was awesome! I am a big fan of pork chops and they were cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were especially done well - with just the right consistency, texture and a great home-style taste. Yes, I do recommend \"Pie for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner\"!!  :-)   Dillon told me that they will be open until Midnight during the week on a consistent basis. This is just the type of restaurant we need on North Craig Street. I imagine the neighborhood will provide a warm welcome to this dining establishment..."}
{"text":"We went right after opening so this review might be biased by that fact. We had a decent time and enjoyed the casual, relaxed atmosphere. I had the pork chop with mashed potatoes and cornbread. My wife had the char. We both enjoyed our meals. My pork was quite tasty, however a tad overcooked and chewy. The mashed potatoes were salted just a little too heavily, but otherwise were good. My favorite part of the meal was the cornbread muffin. The service was a little spotty -- friendly staff, but it felt as though the staff were still adjusting to the location and were not yet fully comfortable with the menu and the mood of the place, so that affected the service a bit. We also had the rhubarb pie, which was superb. Overall, I'd give this place a 3/5, keeping in mind that the quality will probably rise as the restaurant ages. I will definitely return once the restaurant has been open a bit longer."}
{"text":"Every single star is directed towards the pie.  While I had lunch here, I can only think of the pie and how I can make an excuse to come back for more pie.

My colleague and I decided to go here for lunch after much anticipation of the opening.  I ordered the 'hearty salad' for $10.  It's hearty, but the size is more on the meager side of things.  It did have nice chunks of fresh blue cheese, beets, and hard boiled eggs.  Hearty, but small.  But tasty.  My friend had the 4 oz pork chop special with two (or maybe three?) sides.  

We decided to each order a different piece of pie and then share.  I ordered a rhubarb pie and after one bite did not want to share.  Then I tasted my friend's vinegar pie and I wanted to steal his piece and run.  In honor of my grandma's memory I can't say this is the best pie I ever had but I can certainly say this is by far the best pie I've ever eaten in a restaurant.  I don't even know what a vinegar pie is but somehow it is all I think about.  And the crust was made from the wings of an angel.  Thank you, Pie for Breakfast, for taking forever to open but not disappointing us.  Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars is a more fair rating... but I'll start here and try them again in a while. Over all everything was reasonably good, but it seemed odd that a place called pies for breakfast only had 3 types of pies to choose from.

My wife and my son in law got the pancakes, I had the omelette with asparagus. It was all prepared well, and came out in a reasonable time, especially for as busy as they were.

The portions are sensible, not large,  although all the sides are extra. Which I guess makes it a little on the expensive side for what it is. 

If Pies is in you name, a few more pies to choose from would be in order... they have just been open a few weeks. I'll check back in a few months and see how they adjust."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast.  Soft opening, so limited menu and hours at this time.  Staff was very friendly and able to answer a couple of questions about the menu.  
Not a large space with 4 booths, a couple 4 tops and a few 2 tops that they can put together, and about 8 seats at the counter a a few in the window.  
Was told they will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner once they have their legs under them and the soft opening is complete.  The bakery has some interesting items and will be sure to stop back and grab a few items.  
Will the food is rather basic it is flavorful and fairly priced.  My corned beef tongue hash with fresh salt rising bread, eggs and mujadara was very good."}
{"text":"Great pies! Haven't try pie with these flavor (vinegar, rhubarb)! Can't wait for the full menu next week"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to the opening of this restaurant as many others have for quite a long time. I am hopeful that my experience was due to just opening and not a precursor of things to come. 

The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu however there were problems when it came to asking about items being vegetarian. I ordered two sunny side up eggs, salt toast, hash browns and coffee. The server did not bring, or ask, if cream or sugar was needed nor bring them. Eventually I was brought creamers but had to ask the people at the next table for their sugar. I also had to flag down the server for jam or jelly. The toast and hash browns had a definite mouth feel and taste of animal fat. I asked the server about this so she went to ask the chef. She returned to tell me they used clarified butter. A fairly lame excuse. Clarified butter does not make food take on the flavor and mouth feel of lard. I went on to order the salt bread toast. It was served with a raspberry coulis, something that I would have appreciated with my first order and which was quite good. The toast is grilled so again the distinct flavor of animal fat, particularly lard, was front and center. Front of house came to ask how things were and I asked why the flavor of animal fat was so distinct as I was told my items were vegetarian by both the server and the chef. I asked if the grill was being used for vegetarian and non vegetarian items, which it is. The grill is quite small and I was told that there is no divider to separate the foodstuffs. So you may order hash browns that are grilled in the same area where bacon was just removed. It's definitely something that needs to be rectified and I have faith that it will."}
{"text":"I'm super excited that I went somewhere while it's still new!  Of course, I love the name. 

Went for breakfast and sat at the counter because it was busy within fifteen minutes of opening. Service was excellent. Had eggs, cottage bacon (didn't really know what that was; is kind of the country ham equivalent of bacon) and salt raised bread (which is an Appalachian thing that's now trendy) and, of course, pie.

Coke products - yay. Besides that, the bread and pie are outstanding. We tried the vinegar pie, which this country girl would call \"mock apple pie.\"  It is a gooey somewhat apple-y filling and the crust isn't flaky, but still delicious.   They also had shoofly and chocolate mousse pie (I think we missed rhubarb by a few days)

Two people, non-alcoholic beverages, shared pie - $30 before tip. Great deal. 

Can't wait to try more baked goods and go for lunch or dinner!"}
