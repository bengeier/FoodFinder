{"text":"One star because the food was horrible, we ordered the popular things people will order . Sashsimi had this stale taste, the Sui Mui tasted like it was from two days ago and it was good. We ordered the ribs and we got the ribs when we were almost finish eating , they brought the bill and we didn't even finish eating. Few minutes passed I for my BBQ bun which I forgot I ordered because they took s long to bring it out. The bun was soggy and tasted bad. I won't recommend going there !!!!"}
{"text":"really like this place! for 3 years never found something bad. Only chiken teryaki not that good as it was before. But sushi and everything else taste good"}
{"text":"Don't really understand how this place got lower than 3 stars.  Went there on a Sunday night, both service and food was pretty good.   For $35 we got miso soup and salad to start.  Followed by a order of Dragon roll and 8 pieces of sashimi.    Than had chicken teriyaki and a big plate of beef fried rice.  In addition, shrimp and vegetable tempura also came with the meal.  We ended off with 2 ice creams as well.  Not one complaint.  This meal was well worth the $35 bucks.  Yes, not fine dining type of quality, but c'mon, all that for $35... you can't get that anywhere else.   Will i come back... definitely.  As long as the price stays the same :)   Fyi.. this meal was actually $30 before.  The original location was near Clarke and Yonge.  And, i believe that location is still going pretty strong.  Can't seem to remember the original name for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to ginza with my boyfriend for dinner. Worst experience I have ever had at an AYCE sushi restaurant. Absolutely terrible, stay away! 22 dollars for AYCE dinner, what a rip off! The menu was the same for dinner as it is for 14 dollar lunch. I've been to some bad AYCE restaurants but this one is the worst. The food was awful too!"}
{"text":"I used to come here two or three times a month. I usually go to Sushi Mon when I would visit Vegas, but their lunch all-you-can-eat prices were a bargain. The first time I went here, we made chummy-chummy with the owner. Really nice fellow. He hooked it up with the sake and beer. I walked out of the place full and buzzed. When we returned a second time, he totally remember us. The food is good. However, one complaint I have is a lot of the rolls are saucy. I can only eat so much mayo.   In summary, 2 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service."}
{"text":"they closed down! does anyone know if they moved somewhere else? i am having major sushi withdrawal. thank you!"}
{"text":"The AYCE is a joke.  While the quality of the fish itself is acceptable the actual sushi and handrolls are poorly made.  My spicy salmon handroll was a sliceof salmon with hot sauce slapped on it. You never get what everything you ordered without having to ask them to follow up, half the time you only get about 70% of what you ask for. The chicken teriyaki is incredibly dry.  For the price they're charging it really isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Ginza is awesome!!! There are so many all you can eat sushi places but Ginza beats them hands down. Customer service A+++. Sushi freshness A+++!!! My son (16 months old) even LOVES this place! I live on the west side (215 & Durango) & we drive all the way over there weekly b/c we get our Ginza cravings! LOL! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"The all you can eat menu is limited compared to other establishments.  If you like raw fish, this is not the place.  Many cooked rolls with the imitation crab. Ordered the spicy scallop roll and could not find any scallops, only the imitation crab mixture.  The raw fish is sliced very, very thin. The more rolls you order, the more rice they include in the rolls.  Quality of the fish is poor but if you like imitation crab and lots of rice, this is the place."}
{"text":"Disappointed with this experience.  The all you can eat menu was very limited and prices confusing.  Would definitely not go back."}
{"text":"We always go to Ginza on Weston Road and it's to die for! We thought we'd try a different location....big mistake! Worst customer service EVER !  The menu offered way less items and the wine costs more. We are usually fab with tipping, NOT this time. This place should close down, not even sure how they've made it this far. Never again!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here off and on for a few years. We used to love this place. What has changed?  The quality seems to have gone down quite a bit. My wife likes saba but the last several times it has been over pickled and under cooked. I can almost say \"nothing special here\" except for the udon noodles!  I really like udon noodles and the tempura udon on the menu here is very good! It has big slices of shiitake mushrooms, rich broth and loads of noodles. It is why we still go to Ginza."}
{"text":"I live near by Ginza Sushi, and have been wanting to try it. But I have to say the exterior had held me at bay. Well Friday night a friend and I took the plunge!  The sushi was very good. The menu was a little limited on fresh rolls.... I felt..... But everything we ordered was fresh and yummy. I typically do not like to eat \"all you can eat\" sushi, but I would gladly come here again."}
{"text":"Whenever I make my way back to my old Vaughan stomping grounds, Ginza is my go-to place to order some sushi delivery.  I've never eaten in the restaurant, so I can't comment on table service, but the people taking my order over the phone have always been courteous. Delivery is also reasonable, usually arriving within 45 minutes of ordering. Another bonus is that orders over $25 (before tax) do not have a delivery charge if you're in the delivery zone for the location.   I love ordering sushi combos, and Ginza has one of the best deals I've ever seen at any sushi restaurant with their Regular Party Tray - $30 for 45 pieces of assorted sushi, sashimi, and rolls (California, Spicy Salmon, and Kamikaze). I always opt to pay an extra $2 and swap out the Cali Roll for a regular salmon or tuna roll. The fish has always been fresh, and they provide you a selection of sushi and sashimi that switches up any time you order (with salmon and tuna being standard in every order). I've never been disappointed with the quality, especially for the price. I will definitely continue to order from here."}
{"text":"First time at this Ginza location at Dufferin and Major Mackenzie. Atmosphere is clean and spacious. Had the AYCE. Food was all very tasty, especially the hand rolls and sashimi. Servers were attentive and food came quick. Would come again!"}
{"text":"This place was only okay. DO NOT go during \"happy hour\" when they are about to close, when things are half off. They are half off for a reason, they taste awful, and I would not be surprised if you get food poisoning from it. Even the soy sauce tasted bad. I went there before not during happy hour also, and it was just alright."}
{"text":"I used to love this place exclusively for its sashimi but everything else they do has become all about using old ingredients to save money. Today's takeout included salmon on my dragon roll being a dark grey/brown, clearly made days ago and left to go bad"}
{"text":"I want to thank Yelp and all the Yelppers out there for helping me find this WONDERFUL sushi restaurant!  I was in Henderson on business and was looking for some good sushi when I saw that Ginza had some great reviews and they were not lying!  The fish was very fresh and the custom rolls are great (try the volcano roll!)  The staff also made this experience that much more wonderful.  \"Moonshine\" was very funny but also took the time to explain to me what part of the fish makes the best sushi.  I loved this place so much that I went twice while I was in town for only 3 days.  If you are looking for some great sushi in the Henderson area, look no further!"}
{"text":"I'm usually hesitant to try new sushi bars without getting a good recommendation first, but something was telling me that I needed to check this place out. I'm glad I did. I went on a Thursday night and there were maybe a dozen guests at tables scattered throughout and nobody at the sushi bar. Since it was just me I sat at the bar. The place is nice, clean and well kept. I ordered a variety of items from the all you can eat menu and all tasted good. What caught my attention though was the Sushi Chef's attention to detail.  I had ordered Ika (squid) and he thoroughly washed it before he prepared it for me. Nice...and then he took an avocado (he was making a roll) for another guest, cut it in half and although it looked ok to me, it was not up to his standards and he threw it out and cut open a new that looked better than the first one. I thought that was awesome. They have impressed me and I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Doing this review on Ginza even though they're closed now.  Food and service was great and it was a very family friendly atmosphere.  Their tempura was truly the best in the valley.  Green tea ice cream was also to die for.  Never broke the bank when the wife and I ate there.  Always was only about 40 bucks.  Very disappointed they're closed.  Have to find another main sushi place.  We'll miss Ginza."}
{"text":"Possibly the best all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant in the area. The price, unique creations, attentive staff, and unusual building, make Ginza a true foodie experience."}
{"text":"I live on the west side of town and I still make the drive for this place.  The customer service is always great and the food doesn't get any better than this.  I love spicy food and if you're a fan too, then you have to try the Spicy Shrimp Hand Roll.  That is a must order for me when I go there.  5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I don't even eat sushi, but this place is great. The people are so friendly and the staff is beyond excellent. They always greet my girlfriend by name, and they know what she wants to drink before she orders.  My girlfriend says that \"Moonshine\" is the best sushi maker EVER! (LOL).  This place used to be a 50's diner, so it is BEYOND weird that it is now this weird pseudo 50's diner / japanese restaurant hybrid.  Bottom-line is that the staff rocks. Were it just for the food, I'd personally give it 3 stars, but the efforts that the owner and his excellent staff put forth are worth the extra star!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Ginza and as always it was Spectacular!!!  Great sushi, rolls and service.  Price was right also for all you can eat.  Presentation was beautiful.  Will definitely go back for more!!  Recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, the other  stuff on the menu was ok. What they serve is the least I'd expect considering the prices they charge. No shrimp tempura though.  What bugs me about this place is they don't advertise on their website that lunch buffet on weekends is 16.99! On the website it says 13.99 for the AYCE and nothing else so I think it's a bit dishonest on their part. Do I really have to call? 16.99, That's spoon and fork prices but not spoon and fork quality in terms of food and service.   The service was really substandard considering only 3 tables were occupied. Everything was slow and every time something did come there was always something missing (no wasabi, no plates, they took the menu after the first round of orders, as if to tell you don't order any more after this). They also have you fill in a form to put in your orders, but in round 2, they hand you the same form! They just give you a different pen to differentiate from the first batch which I found really strange.  This place is basically a worse version of spoon and fork but still better than a lot of other crappy AYCEs ive been in."}
{"text":"It's a terrible experience I have to say. Nothing taste good. Look at the picture you tell me how they cook. Sashimi not fresh. Sushi rice is terrible."}
{"text":"When a 50's diner mates with a sushi bar you get Ginza Sushi.    It has the ambiance of some of some crazy japanese animi movie.  My one recommendation is to just go ahead and get the all you can eat special.  I came in to eat a few rolls and for the price and quality there is no difference."}
{"text":"Ohhhh, old 5 & Diner. You're much, much better now.  I passed this place a few times, but never went in because they didn't have all you can eat at the time. Finding an AYCE sushi place in Henderson is pretty difficult - especially finding a GOOD one. My friends and I went here for dinner to see what they offered on the AYCE menu. They have some of the best baked rolls ever, and the fish is SO fresh. I will say that the Japanese Lasagna is kind of hard to eat. They use a whole friggin block of cream cheese! The cream cheese doesn't soften. But it's yummy. We ordered a bottle of sake for $25 (which sucks, because the same bottle is $10 at Lee's - ahh!). I would order 20 Screaming Orgasms and be in heaven. They have the BEST Screaming Orgasm ever.  But the one thing they do better than ANY restaurant I've seen is...  Well, you'll just have to go there for your birthday and see. Seriously. Tell them it's your birthday - someone, ANYONE'S BIRTHDAY! Prepare to be amazed! And super happy."}
{"text":"I used to have this place as 5 stars, but I have to call them out.  Before, \"all you can eat\" meant all you can eat.  But here, they put limits on one order of mussels per person, one order of salmon eggs per person, etc. even though you PAY for all you can eat.  I used to love their sushi and the service is still good, but I would like to get what I pay for, especially since we have gone there over a dozen times."}
{"text":"BEST SCREAMING ORGASM EVVVERR! The sushi is unique and yummy. The 50s dinner theme is odd, but staff is friendly. The food keeps me coming back every time I'm in town! Would defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was not what i expected from this place. AMAZING! This mom n pop sushi place is really comfortable inside and you can't beat the All You Can Eat prices for that kind of quality. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to ayce lunch with some pals of mine. The waitresses were very rude. They kept me giving me dirty looks. Possibly because I am Jewish. The food was okay. But the salmon tasted very bad. I did not want to tip them cause they sucked but their was a mandatory tip. Overall the sushi tasted like pooh, waitresses were hoes and salmon was weird."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Ginza since it opened a few years ago and the food and service there seems to be constantly deteriorating. I don't know whether to blame it on a change in ownership or chefs - it used to be a really good sushi place that I'd rate 5 stars... Our last visit on Sat was total disappointment, even the supermarket sushi from Longo's tastes better. The service was slow and unfriendly, the only good part of the meal was a black pearl roll. I ordered tom yum goong and left it almost untouched. My husband had sushi combo and he barely finished half of it. This is most likely our last visit to Ginza :("}
{"text":"This place is great - excellent sushi, unique atmosphere (looks like a diner), and the sushi chefs and waitresses are sooo friendly.  Great choice!"}
{"text":"Very fresh, staff tries to please but are a bit slow.  For sushi in the area by far its good and not expensive."}
{"text":"Very decent fish for an ayce place. Yes rolls are not fancy but selection and plentiful and quality is high. I'm always scared of ayce places but friends took us here and we all had an amazing diner."}
{"text":"We went with a group of about 15 people for a la carte. Sushi was less than mediocre. All the sushi rolls had too much tempura flakes. The deluxe dragon roll looked alright but flavour was not there. The sushi ultimate did not taste fresh. We did not have sashimi but our friends did get it and were given reasonable sized slices. Would skip this place and recommend trying another sushi joint."}
{"text":"The restaurant looked nice so i was hopeful when I walked in. They also dont show the All You Can Eat menu on the website, which is only just a page of food.  We ordered coconut shrimp, chicken wings, and veggie tempura, ((THEY DONT SERVE SHRIMP TEMPURA FOR LUNCH)) and they all came on the same plain white plate, so the presentation was horrible. We also ordered the red and green dragon roll, and the presentation was slightly better. But the salmon on the outside of the roll was SMOKED salmon, not fresh salmon. This ruined the taste of the sushi completely.   The food came really slow, and the number of pieces we ordered didnt match the pieces indicated on the menu.  The service was also questionable. A waiter was taking the order of the table beside mine, when the phone rang. The waiter immediately went to pick it up, while in the middle of taking someone's order...  This place deserves a 2/5 stars. Most likely will not be going there again!!!"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy atmosphere. Soups and sushi are great. Lot's of parking on the plaza. Gets busy at the evening."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. The people who work there ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RUDE!!!!!!!! I WILL NEVER COME BACK. It was 15.99+taxes and food was okay.   We paid and they laughed at us because no tip. And didn't say bad. Super rude. They only give u one menu that's it. Never go listen to the reviews"}
{"text":"Gone down. Simply not the same place anymore.  They premake their rolls in the morning/lunch for dinner. Rolls break apart all the time.  Will stop going there."}
{"text":"Tried this resto for a second time. Service and food are very poor.  Found a dirty receipt in my bento box on the salad which the server did not offer to replace.  I had to ask for a new salad.  Curry Chicken was breaded, fried chicken with sauce poured on top.  That is curry chicken??  Quite disgusted and what i did eat, repeated and came up on me.  Second time is not a charm.  I will not be back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 starts. Their takeout is ok. But for dining they are horrible. Must be the worst service I've ever had. We walked in for dinner tonight and decided to go with Al la carte.  We got tea and pop to drink. We sat for 30 minutes with the menus without anyone paying attention. Paid for our pop and left. The other day we came for AYCE lunch and got served with 70%rice 30%sashimi. Very very bad restaurant. Poor quality food. Gave this place 2 chances -  no more. Don't waste your time and money. Look up Ginza on Weston road/ Langstaff much better service and quality food there."}
{"text":"The sushi was great up until the point where I happened to look over at the cook in the back kitchen spitting in plain view. After seeing that I was done."}
{"text":"The interior is great but the service needs a lot of work. The service alone would deter me from coming back. I understand that sushi restaurants and such don't usually ever provide really good customer service but it would be nice to at least be greeted.  That being said the food is yummy and a good value. There's truthfully not much more to say about this place: good interior, good food and a good value, however their customer service has hit the fan."}
{"text":"Rude service, the sushi was terrible.  I asked a few questions before ordering, as I was allergic to certain items. The servers were laughing and making rude comments under their breath. The sushi was almost stale and I threw it out. Waste of money compared to the other sushi places around the area. Would never return.  Portions were a joke, they were selfish with ingredients."}
{"text":"The NEWEST of all the Ginza Sushi branches, this location has been open for approximately 3 months and I was not aware of it. Maybe because the last time I visited this new corner plaza at Dufferin and Major Mackenzie was in December for the easily visible LCBO.   It's not the easiest Ginza Sushi to pick out from driving on the road unlike the Warden/Hwy 7 location. We arrived right at their NOON opening hour this Sunday and didn't notice their open sign on so we walked in and ask for seats. We were the only dine-in patrons for the next hour while others came in for pick-up orders.   The decor is very dramatic with wooden side panelling and soft spot lighting that makes this feel a bit like a modern/feudal Japan dining space. The seats are very COMFY faux leather and the whole space is open-spaced.   We were given the Lunch SPECIAL menu on top of the regular menu and I went directly to the Curry Pork Cutlet Bento($7.95) and my friend had Spicy Chicken Bento($7.95) which were 2 of the lower cost items aside from a couple Vegetarian options. The Lunch Special & Bento Box range from $6.95 to $9.95 and the difference is that the Bento has Salad, Rolls and Ice Cream on top of the Miso Soup.  The Spicy Chicken was nothing special as it was thin chicken slices topped with a spicy SWEET tomato-like sauce that lacked on the heat. The Curry Pork Cutlet however was pretty good with standard Curry sauce and a Crispy Pork Cutlet. It's not the best quality I've ever had but it definitely hits the right spot.  There's a Summer Promo exclusive to Maple where the item to notice is $1.25 Malpeque Oysters after 5pm for a limited time."}
{"text":"A friend had been going here for a while and couldn't stop raving about her favorite sushi place.  I have pretty low expectations and they failed to meet them.  And it's no longer my friend's favorite place to visit when she goes to Vegas.  The food was ok...three stars. There was no one else in the place. The attitude from the younger sushi chef was unbelievable...we should have walked out.  What an a-hole.   The waitresses stood about 2 feet away from us the entire time.  Awkward. My friend who LOVED going here and has brought several people, said she's never going back.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I love sushi. No. Really. I love sushi. I have dreams about it. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and wonder if the Japanese mayonnaise they mix with scallops and spread on a California Roll comes in gallons. Sometimes I go to sleep, giddy as a schoolgirl, knowing that the next day I will have a fresh, tender rainbow roll, smothered in Sriracha and wasabi to eat later that day. Yes, sushi makes me that happy.  So you can only imagine my disappointment when I went to Ginza today and got a rice ball. Not okay Ginza, not okay.  I love sushi because of the fish, the buttery flaky fish and the rich, horrific-for-you mayonnaise that reminds me why I work out six times a week. When you give me a simple roll that has more rice than fish or avocado, I get a little sad. Cue frowning face. Then I get excited because I had the second, 1000 calorie roll, to consume next and alas, the same problem. Way too much rice. It made a normally enjoyable roll too filling, not because of the rich sauce and scallop mixture, but because there was enough rice to feed a small country on the roll. I've also eaten here for AYCE and even though they have a great menu with many choices, the large amount of rice ruins the roll every time. I've only once gotten a roll, the White House roll, that was great and had just the right amount of rice.  The service is decent. I've had the same server the two times I've gone there and she had a bit of an attitude when (I promise) I was nothing but friendly and used the manners my parents thankfully taught me when I was a kid. I can definitely ignore mediocre service if the food is worth it, but unfortunately, it isn't. Thumbs down to Ginza for ruining tonight's sushi dream. Thumbs down indeed."}
{"text":"This place sucked. Don't get me wrong, the price and portions were very good but the food was not. They use too much mayo in the cali roll, the rice was too mushy, katsu sauce is awful and should be served on the side, salmon doesn't taste fresh. I've tasted way better, Sushi Twister & Momo Sushi are definitely ahead of this place."}
{"text":"This place is the biggest joke and the reason why I hate random sushi places such as this. Yes I know Ginza has more than one location. How? I have no idea because their customer service is a joke. Their servers are nothing more than hostile people who absolute hate their lives and show their attitude to their customers. It takes over 1 hour to get your food at this place even when it's a simple order and there are two people in the restaurant and if you even call for pickup you have to wait over 20 mins as they put you on hold while the waiters decide to gossip with each other.   I have been coming to this place for years because I live so close to it. But over the last three years that quality of the fish has really gone downhill and on top of that their customer service is horrendous. What kind of ownership does this place have that they can't control the attitude and complete disregard for their customers. Seriously be warned, unless you want crap service, crap quality of sushi, questionable atmosphere and unnecessarily sassy waitresses avoid this place like the plague. I would suggest New Generation which isn't too far from this location."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs! I went for dinner with my mom and the sushi and sashimi was not fresh at all. We returned most of the plates and the waitress was really nice about it but the chefs looked really pissed off. She actually got really sick later that evening.. We definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"It must be the economy, but even our favorite sushi place is losing points. I had lunch the other day and had the all you can eat. We all ordered different rolls and they all seemed to have that \"surimi\" stuff in it (fake crabmeat). THE AWFUL ASPECT IS THAT A ROLL LIKE A SPIDER SHOULD HAVE SOFTSHELL CRAB ALL THE WAY  THROUGH THE ROLL, IN MY CASE IT HAD SOME CRAB LEGS STICKING OUT OF THE END PIECES AND THE INSIDE IS 99% surimi, this is really SAD. The same \"game\" was played on other rolls too. The fish in nigiri should have a cold temperature to it and all seemed room temp to me. Stop playing that kid music and put some background music a nice Japanese restaurant should have. The waitress? always drops off the plate and says, \"enjoy\" \"enjoy\" how robotic. I miss the good old days of Ginza."}
{"text":"Seriously THE BEST Salmon Sashimi and Green Dragon Rolls ever! I did take out and it was boxed very nicely!! They even gave me extra unique rolls with shrimp to add flare to the box. Very quick, professional and the gentleman taking my order was funny too!! :-) very very clean restaurant!  Bathrooms were very well appointed and around a corner which added further privacy."}
{"text":"I'd give it half a star if i could.I recently went with my girlfriend for dinner. Service was horrible couldn't get a refill of water without asking and when i asked it still took over 10min mind you it wasn't busy at all but that's fine. We then asked another waiter for the bill cause our waiter had completly forgotten about us and it took another 10min just to get the bill. I payed debit and didn't include tip because I was gonna put the tip in cash. The server then looked at the receipt and had to make it a point and say \"you know tips not included right cause you didn't put any\". Even if service is horrible which it was ill at bare minimum tip 10% but because he had to make it a point that i didn't tip him and the service was horrible i didn't tip anything. And to top it all off he got mad and said \" you should show respect next time\". All and all horrible experience and by the amount of 1 stars im not suprised."}
{"text":"I don't know what twilight zone people are living in. The first time I came to Ginza, I thought it was meh. But with so many stars, I thought perhaps I'd overlooked something. So I came back. Are you freakin' kidding me, Yelp?? Seriously? What planet are you 4 and 5 star people living in?? The fish was not-so-fresh. Not that it was to the point of being scary...but it didn't have the fresh clean taste of high quality fish either. The rice to fish ratio was vastly in favor of the rice.  In a world of limited opportunities to eat out, I can't fathom why anyone would ever eat here.  I give it two big MEHs that aren't far from a BLEH."}
{"text":"I am not sure if I went to Ginza on an off-night, but my experience there was pretty bad.  First of all, I would like to point out that the restaurant itself is a converted Five-and-Diner with an exterior that was made to look like like an old-fashioned soda shop.  Ginza has thrown a gaudy, green neon sign on the chromed-out edifice of the old restaurant.  I would not have stepped in to the place based on looks, but because it was the only sushi restaurant identified on Yelp to be near my location at the time, and because it had a four-star rating, I decided it was worth a shot.  I sat at the sushi bar.  The chefs seemed disinterested if not depressed. I am used to sushi chefs who are anxious to make me something, yelling out \"What's next?\"  At Ginza, they seemed almost intimidated by the customer before them: me.  The food was so-so.  I was disappointed by the portions.  The sushi was sliced so thin I would call it \"miserly.\"  I could understand if I had ordered all-you-can-eat, but I was eating a la cart.  One test I have for a sushi restaurant is to see how fresh the mackerel is. Mackerel is a very fishy fish.  I know this.  I feel that if you do not have fresh mackerel you should not have mackerel on your menu.  The mackerel at Ginza was extremely fishy and almost acidic as though it had been cured.  Maybe that is a way to serve this type of fish, but I have never had it that way before and it was unpalatable.      Once again, maybe I was there on an off-night.  The only reason I would go back there is under the confidence of a trusted friend who knows sushi."}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner here since it's pretty close to where I live.  As we walked into this dark and eerie restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly waitress.  As I am flipping through the menu, my eyes started hurting...the menu has a black background with gold/yellowish font.  Gosh that's terrible on my eyes.  Then as one waitress came to see if we were ready to order after we politely asked to give us a few minutes, another one came and ask the same question.   This occurred a couple of more times throughout our dinner.  My friend ordered the spicy tuna plate and I still cannot decide.  Then each one of them took turn and revisited me to ask if I was ready to order.  My friend added an order of edamame to his order.    I tasted his food to see if I should order..and glad I did because I ended up not ordering anything.  The spicy tuna was eehh, and the edamame was a bit overcooked for my taste.    Needless to say, I am not coming back.  I would rather drive the distance to my favorite AYCE sushi place, ISLAND SUSHI."}
{"text":"Was there last night to have Thai food.   Menu was limited and the food was awful. Will not be back."}
{"text":"this isn't a sushi place. They make stuff similar to sushi or a roll but that's not sushi"}
{"text":"\"Ginza... Ginza me outta here!\"  I was a little weary of visiting this place after reading the other reviews that have been posted, and regretfully decided to try it anyways.  I decided to go with the all you can eat option. The service was horribly slow in receiving everything after placing an order. The worst thing I had to eat was the beef skewers... Which was extremely well overdone.  The rest of the sushi was simply mediocre at the most. Asked for another sheet of paper to place the second round order, and they came back with the exact same paper from the first order (are they that cheap that they have to re-use the order forms?).  Waiting for the food from the second round took double the amount of time the first one took. Sadly, I was looking forward to leaving at the very end of it all.  The interior of the restaurant has a newer feel to it. However, they did not have adequate floor mats at the entrance for the winter weather, which caused a very dangerous/slippery situation at the entrance."}
{"text":"Its not bad but its the worst Ive had in Henderson. It was late and this was close to my house. If you can go to most any other place on henderson. \"I luv Sushi\" is my favorite the other reviews are fairly accurate about this place. I wouldnt avoid this place. I just wouldnt seek it out."}
{"text":"Ginza is my home sushi restaurant when I am in Las Vegas. My fiancee and I have been going to their restaurant for about three years (or however long it's been open). They have the best service and amazing sushi. The chef's are awesome. Moon shine and Honda are probably our favorites. They always give us something new to try, even if we don't ask for it. They're great at giving suggestions based on what fish we like. We love this place so much, this is where my fiancee preposed to me. The owner is always on property and very social and makes sure the customers are happy. He helped a lot with the proposal, even when my fiancee walked in an hour before to plan it. Really great place!"}
{"text":"I love Ginza and the idea of a sushi bar in a pseudo dinning car. I mean it makes sense. Japan grew to it's world status by copying American processes and refining, how more Americana can you get than a chrome dining car that failed as a retro 50s diner? Sushi, as I have been lead to believe, is a communal / social endeavor. At Ginza, it is hard to do with the loud Japanese pop music. I prefer my sushi with more soothing music or at least with music at a volume that you can carry on a conversation. Maybe I am the exception and not the norm. I love the food and the service is good and friendly and, as previously mentioned, there is no better place to celebrate a birthday. I recommend you to find out yourself. It is awesome!"}
{"text":"I came here sunday afternoon around lunch time. I WAS seated quickly even with 7 adult. We ordered the $13.99 buffet. The service was rather slow but it gave us time to eat and choose what we wanted next. I reccoment it."}
{"text":"The service stinks. The food is edible. The atmosphere/deco is pretty nice. The sushi is inauthentic and very blah.  I ordered a tuna roll and it was COOKED TUNA.  uhm wtf? Also, there thai menu is really inauthentic if you ask me. Definately pass this place unless you're dying of hunger."}
{"text":"Sunday night dinner was a highlight, thanks to Ginza Sushi. We didn't go all you can eat, instead went a la cart and ordered rolls. Green caterpillar roll (as seen on photo), Ginza roll and Volcano roll were our favorite! The order took less then 15 min before we could enjoy it."}
{"text":"We came for the buffet. They told us we can only order 10 sashimi per person. Never heard of such buffet before. It was ridiculous and I will never go there any more. Really terrible experience!"}
{"text":"I think I'm developing a thing for restaurants with bad dining rooms but great food.  As has been remarked before, the old five and diner building for a sushi place kept me from walking in for about a year.  Finally succumbing to their late hours of operation, I walked in on impulse and ate at the bar.  Good choice.  The staff at the sushi bar are friendly and funny; definitely buy them a beer if you're having a good time (and don't forget to separately tip them, apart from the server).  The sushi is very good.  I recommend avoiding the booth tables.  I hate them; dark and ugly."}
{"text":"Went here on a night the restaurant was not busy. Did the all you can eat and more than half of the items we ordered did not arrive. When we asked the waitress where the dishes were she played stupid and acted as if it was a magic show, like they disappeared. There was zero remorse for all the dishes we didn't receive. Needless to say I will not return to this restaurant. In an area filled with plenty of all you can eat sushi establishments, I will take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"It had been about a year since I last frequented this place and now I remember why it's been so long. We usually go to the Ginza in Thornhill, which is great! This Ginza however, is a far cry from great. We ordered from the 'All You Can Eat' Lunch menu on a Saturday. The joint was pretty busy, shocking. The wonton soup consisted of 2 raw wonton wrappers with no filling floating in what looked like water, not broth. The wontons had no filling, literally, I'm not even exaggerating in the slightest. After telling the waitress, she looked at me like there was something wrong with me. The green salad was yellow, no julienne carrot pieces, no frilly vegetable shavings, just sad looking, yellow, head lettuce with a smidge of dressing. At this point our prospects at having a decent meal was looking meek. Then came the sesame chicken, which had an off-putting texture, like they had taken yesterday's sesame chicken and deep fried it for a couple of minutes to make it look fresh. The vegetable tempura had no flavour along with the dipping sauce it came with. I can't remember the rest of what we ordered, I think my brain had forgotton, in an attempt to prevent flashbacks of this visit. I wouldn't eat sushi here if it was the last sushi restaurant in the universe. PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Kitchen food was tasteless, cold, and disgusting. Service was awful, restaurant was half full and it took over 45 mins to get any sushi. There is no reason to ever come back here !"}
{"text":"A better all you can eat sushi place that has more than just sushi.   Adding Thai options to the menu always is nice crowd pleaser.  Seriously, who doesn't like Pad Thai.   Food is consistent and fresh. I have been coming here for ages.   The staff needs to be a little nicer here. Which would make this place way better."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm giving this place a 5 star with zero regrets.   Came here for take out on Saturday and ordered two maki rolls with extra ginger. The salmon avocado roll and spicy crispy salmon roll (kamikaze) came to just under $10 with tax.They were not shy on the ginger request which made me a happy girl.   The kamikaze roll was great and met my expectations. Spicy, crispy, large cuts of salmon and little rice. The avocado salmon roll was the same; meaty salmon cuts, large pieces of avocado without heaps of rice. The rice was cooked to my liking and the sizes were decent. I was content after two rolls.  :)"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best sushi places in Vegas.  The price is very good for the quality.  The building use to be a 50s diner so its pretty spacious.  Service was good and my favorite dish was probably the rainbow roll.  Get the AYCE if you go here"}
{"text":"Really not happy with this place. It's nice and big and there were a few chefs there during the lunch, but the service was terrible. They did the classic move of \"forgetting\" part of my order. The food I did get was average at best. Definitely won't return. There's at least 5 other AYCE places I would go within a 10 min drove."}
{"text":"Probebly the WORST SERVICE I have ever had in 34 years. It took 15 minutes to just get a waitress to get our drink order and there was only about 25 people in the place.  When she was taking our order on the all you can eat, all of a sudden she said only one app per person. So we only ordered one app per person, we got one 10 min later and the next 2 45 mintues later. Our sushi order took over 45 min to come to us and when we tried to order again the waitress told us that our hour was up and then she smiled. I heard her argueing with the next table as well cause they didnt get what they ordered and she told them this is what they ordered and if they dont like then ohwell they still pay. I had to ask for Wasabi and Ginger 4 times before my table of 3 got them and my Iced tea was never checked on so I had to flag down the waitstaff twice to get a refill. The owner came to our table and asked how we were, when I told him what was going on he went to the waitress who turned and yelled at him and he sat down at the bar and started drinking with his head down and would not come back to our table. I went to pay the check cause I was so mad and while standing in line I heard the waitress tell 3 other tables all there credit cards were bad. There machine broke but they blamed the customers.   I left zero tip and will NEVER go back and I have told everyone I know TO NEVER GO THERE.  They are a insult to Henderson and Las Vegas and I hope they close so we can get a better one. With all the nice sushi around, SUSHI MON, SUSHI ISLAND, MOMO SUSHI, GOYSA SUSHI, KOTO, ETC. YOU and I shouldnt have to put up with places like Ginza while these other places give perfect service and perfect sushi.   I just Hope that the previous reviewer never gets treated like my self and the other 25 different people on Nov 2 2008 from 8pm to 9 pm did.  I am a chef and work for a 5 star 5 diamond Restaurant who motto is ladies and gentleman serving ladies and Gentleman and customer comes first.  Ginza Sushi does not follow this and deserves to go under."}
{"text":"Food was average. Service was horrible. It took over an hour and half for our complete ayce order to arrive. Took 20 minutes for miso soup to come out. Another 20 minutes  before we got anything else. Then a dish would arrive every 5-10 minutes, which is very annoying. We didn't even order a lot of stuff, three adults and one child. Ordered two bowls of udon one was brought out and the other 5 minutes later. Ordered 3 sushi rolls and each roll was brought out separately, the rice was very soggy. I suspect they do this to discourage you from ordering second/thirds. We also noticed that people who arrived after us were getting their a la carte items before we were getting the same item from the ayce menu. 30 minutes wait for seaweed salad is crazy. Many of the sushi restaurants in this area have an iPad system for ordering, Ginza does not.  Food is average, service is incredibly slow. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is close by my house so my roommate and I thought we'd give it a try.  We went ahead and got the all you can eat sushi ($25 for Dinner).  I went ahead and tried the screaming orgasm, which is a salad of sorts....this was amazing!!!! (and the only reason this place is getting three stars).  After that we tried multiple rolls and I was honestly disappointed with each one.  They were...meh.  They weren't bad, but they weren't great either.  Any roll that had crab in it didn't really have crab at all, it was the fake crab crap.  I thought that was unacceptable being how pricey this place was if you didn't get the all you can eat.  Anyway, this place was nothing special.  Service was quick but I would much rather spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food was horrible and not fresh.But the staff was soooooo rude. The waiter told the kid beside me that he was to young to have the salmon tempura. I would never go back!"}
{"text":"Yesterday we decided to stop in since we were in the area. This location has been many things over the years from a 50's diner, to a wine themed restaurant to Ginza.   We were greeted by the the sushi chef as soon as we walked in. He was pretty cool. But thats where service pretty much ended.  Our server was this older Asian woman who just didn't seem happy with her job. She greeted us and gave us menus.  She came back a few minutes later to take our order but were weren't quite ready. She kind of scowled at us and walked off. From there, we waited over 10 minutes. When she would walk by, I would try to make eye contact and even raised my hand, but to no avail. Finally she came by and took the order.  I had the All you can eat, and my gf had the vegetarian tempura and seaweed salad.  The miso soup was tasty. Her seaweed salad was great as well. I had a spicy tuna roll, the red snapper sashimi, octopus, philly roll, and the spider roll. The only stand outs were the red snapper and the octopus. The octopus was very tender. The snapper was very fresh. Everything else was, meh. The softshell crab in the spider roll was obviously frozen, not fresh and very fishy, on the brink of unpleasant.  In the end, there are many other places in the area that have much better sushi, service and ambiance. But you live and you learn.,,"}
{"text":"Just another AYCE in the city. Nothing special to write home about.  Only thing worth mentioning is they do salmon heads. That's great. The interior feels like something out of a kill bill volume. Awesome."}
{"text":"Their rolls are really good, especially Black Pearl roll - my favorite. Don't order Thai food there, they don't know how to cook it. Like in most Chinese places the service is quite bad, yet they bring the food to your table."}
{"text":"This place has great food and the best prices that I have found in town on all-you-can-eat.  Highly recommended!  (Only thing is that if you order what they think is too much one of the servers will read you the riot act and threaten to charge you full price if you don't eat it all).  Chill out!  besides that great value."}
{"text":"Ginza Sushi is a sushi bar that is next to Sweet Tomatoes on the corner of Steph/Warm Springs in Henderson. It looks like a 50s kinda diner from the outside. We've always wanted to try this place and finally did a few friday nights ago. We went with the AYCE Sushi for $25/person. It was really good.  Granted we ordered the standard fare rolls which isnt smart if you're eating ayce and the waiter let us know.. he was like??/ why are youordering California Roll, Spicy Tuna roll? you need to order like Volcano roll, baked salmon roll... so u know what? we did. we ordered both  along with phili roll, screaming orgasm roll. I enjoyed the screaming orgasm roll and the baked salmon roll (although the last one is very messy) but I dont think I'd have ordered those if I wasnt on the ayce meal plan.  Id def. give this place a try. Its cheaper than sumo sushi but the service @ Sumo & atmosphere was a lot better.   If you want to save a buck maybe just order the rolls you really want."}
{"text":"As other have said, good food at a good price. We will return. I especially like the service, and the welcome when you enter.  Everything tasted very fresh"}
{"text":"First time at this location which has been open for 6 years now.  Their sister locations are at Yonge & Clark and at Leslie & Finch.  This location has at best average AYCE sashimi, sushi and hand rolls.  The beef and chicken skewers were a bit tough but the cooked salmon and salmon head were great.  I came in on a Friday night and it was moderately busy - no one waiting in line or anything but the one flaw I noticed this evening at Ginza is that the four servers they had for the entire restaurant is too understaffed.  Orders were sitting at the sushi bar waiting to be picked up, dishes went missing and we had to ask for them near the end of our meal before they brought them out.  And I'm not saying one or two dishes but the entire sashimi and dim sum orders.  Oh yeah, they have a few dim sum dishes so that's cool and different!  Overall, it's an average Japanese & Thai AYCE and I might go back again if I passed by but wouldn't make the effort to travel to that location."}
{"text":"The food is generally good, all you can eat has almost no meat dishes but the dragon rolls are big and delicious. I would also recommend Dinner for two for a couple or parents with small kids. In most cases they are understaffed so do not expect good service if the place is even half full. Prices are on the average with other all you can eat sushi places."}
{"text":"I debated giving this place 3 or 4 stars. I went with four because the people were very friendly, but it could have easily gone the other way.   I ate at Ginza twice in one day, once alone at lunch and again with someone else during the late night 'happy hour'. If I would have just had lunch it would be four stars, if just happy hour three, or maybe even two. First, the quality of the sushi is decent. Not amazing, not bad, just down the middle. Some pieces taste fresher than others. I didnt have a few pieces that seemed a bit dry on the edges which isnt a good sign.   For lunch I had a special that was fairly reasonable about $17 that included miso, salad, a sushi (both nigiri and sashimi). Everything was fine and I believe fairly priced. The people were friendly. The atmosphere was a bit odd with R&B club music playing a bit loudly, but whatever.   Happy hour was a different story. I came back for happy hour because I had seen a sign on the door stating that everything was 50% off after 9pm (except AYCE and sashimi). When I got there I realized there is actually a small menu of happy hour items and those are the only things that were 50% off. None of these were particularly appealing to us, but we ordered some anyway. By memory some of the happy hour items included: california roll, cucumber roll, tuna roll and a slew of spicy rolls like salmon and tuna. Honestly I did wonder if there were so many spicy rolls because they were trying to use older fish and hide the taste with spicy sauce. Besides the spicy rolls there were only about four normal rolls that could be ordered for happy hour. The ones we ordered were again fine, not amazing, but we were turned off by what we saw as a sort of false advertising.   In the end I think the quality of sushi here is fine, the service is very good, the people are friendly and the prices are reasonable. I would return if I were in a pinch, but Ill be looking for other sushi places."}
{"text":"This is the only location of Ginza that I have visited since it's only across the street. I have only dined in once, ordered the all you can eat option which wasn't that great, they are kinda stingy with their portions if you're doing the all you can eat.  However, I have picked up for takeout for over 10 times, and the portions are much better ordering off the menu. It doesn't take long, usually takes about 10 minutes to prepare the order, and offer 10% or 15% discount if you pay cash or i think debit too.  I have always ordered the same items on the menu, as I've tried few and dropped these off my selections, so sticking around with \"what I know\"  Chicken and beef satays are great, with thick peanuts sauce 5/5  chicken Pnang Curry,  full of flavour with bamboo sticks and all, amazing! 5/5  Calamari, if you're really craving it, then they're average 2.5/5  Coconut shrimp, the breading always fall off, and the flavour isn't there at all 1/5  Basil Beef 0/5  I recommend for takeout always"}
{"text":"Lunch Specials till 3 pm.  Ginza Sushi is a Chinese owned Japanese and Thai restaurant with a menu that reflect that.     Sushi ($6.95) - Nicely presented  - Shrimps, Salmon, Tuna and White Tuna sushi with a Californian roll - Fish quality is OK, there are no wasabi inside the sushi - Shari Rice tasted more like regular rice.. doesn't have that chewy and vinegary taste  You know Ginza is a Chinese run Japanese restaurant. - a spoon is stuck right into your miso soup  - staff talking loudly in Cantonese to one another - It is just strange to have a Japanese/Thai restaurant?!  The decoration is modern and nice The staffs are courteous and polite.  The lunch i order is good size if you going for coffee or dessert or a second lunch. I was still hungry after eating...  I guess time for afternoon tea now!"}
{"text":"WORST SUSHI EVER! Just ate lunch here today and I could not finish my food. I am pretty sure the fish had gone bad. Really disappointed because I was looking forward to sushi today. Service was mediocre and there was only one other person in the restaurant. (that should have been a sign on a Saturday)   Would not eat here again....now off to let my tummy heal :("}
{"text":"First impressions, the lunch menu is pretty limited considering the $13.99 price but has its own ups and downs.   As a positive (although not Japanese authentic), it has dim sum, sashimi and a few selections not offered at other places for lunch such as coconut shrimp and crispy calamari. Don't let that impress you though because both anticipated were not that impressive (our shrimp was way overlooked)  I did however enjoy the sushi and the soba noodles.   On the downside, it does not have any handrolls for lunch and as mentioned, few actual Japanese dishes. I feel like most of the dishes I ordered were Chinese cuisine.   Still with hardly any customers, our orders still got mixed up or did not show up at all. Overall I would pass this place and go for other all you can eats in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE for lunch. The selection is very limited. No shrimp tempura, no beef teriyaki. The food is average. Service is non existent. I finished my tea and they never come around to refill it. Even after we ask for more tea, they never came around to refill. There are better AYCE in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"Slow service, they didn't pay attention to our order. Not the best Ginza out there for sure."}
{"text":"I come to Ginza Sushi a lot, mostly because of convenience. I live down the street and so Ginza is always the first option for a quick sushi stop. Most of the time I sit at the bar with whichever friend I decided to bring with me that night and order the Killer Shrimp roll and green tea and fried banana ice cream. If I want All-You-Can-Eat, I usually go to a different sushi place, because Ginza isn't super quality.  My favorite thing about Ginza is the music they play. A lot of times when you go into a sushi place, they play irritating American dance music. But usually when I come to Ginza, they're playing Japanese or Korean pop music, which is really fun. This place definitely has the best ambiance from any sushi place I've been to, because most sushi places are too crowded, too loud, or too serious. Ginza is perfect for hanging out with friends.  The sushi owner is a really chill guy and all the workers there are really funny and friendly. Most of them know me by name, which is kind of sad, haha.  I always return back!"}
