{"text":"Like romanburgers?  You're gonna love the Soulburger!  Get the platter with fresh outta the fryer french fries, and if it's available, a cup of the spicy, full of goodness gumbo!  My grandkids think Mama J's pancakes are the best anywhere."}
{"text":"Greet food, owner is incredibly nice and polite, kitchen is SPOTLESS. Get the stuffed cabbage. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The fish dinner was the only good food they cooked so far, delivery service sucks they didn't even bring money for change the cook came to my door with his cooking apron on I mean who does that and then goes back to make more food can you say germs okay,  I've order frim them 3 times trying to give them the benefit of a doubt and and each time they let me down by not bringing everything I ordered and paid for and twice my fiid was either tooo salty or just nasty they're macoroni does taste good and they're cakes I will give them that. They almost never open when the sign says they do, a few rimes I rode pass and it was hours afrer they was supposed to be open and they weren't.  They could have a really good business if the owner would take everything about his business a whole lot mire serious and fire his current staff and hir more qualified cooks oder takers and delivery drivers as a business owner you have to step in and make sure everything thing is always running A 1 and always check orders and the way your food looks an tastes before it goes our to customers wether their dinning in or take out orders."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a number of times and read the previous reviews too. I don't know what roasted dog smells like so maybe I missed it but I did look for cobwebs and did not see any. Looked in the kitchen and everything looked real clean so I don't know what that comment was all about, maybe things were not always so before I made my first visit. The only thing I can complain about is not always keeping to the stated hours as mentioned in another review.  But I keep going back because they serve real home made food at mostly fair prices. The reuben with sweet potato fries is very good as is the chili. Collard greens are excellent and the smothered pork chop is also delicious . Same with the stuffed cabbage.  Service is always very quick and attentive and the owners are friendly. Haven't tried the desert yet as I'm watching my weight but fellow diners said peach cobbler was good.  I'm  already thinking of my next visit as I write this !"}
{"text":"I had to give this place another go round and I was pleasantly surprised. All of the issues in my previous visit were fixed.       The food was properly seasoned with ample portion sizes.       The staff was extremely accomodating and friendly.  This building has had a history of failed restaurants so the prognosis is in question for this restaurant.        I pray that this restaurant makes it. Privately owned restaurants in Lorain are vanishing."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Great food and all homemade.  Went there on a Friday for their Lenten fish special and we were not disappointed.  We started with the gumbo and it was outstanding.  The fish (Swai) was mouthwatering and to die for!  It was light and flaky and had a light breading.  The dinner came with \"hot water\" cornbread, which is a pancake-like cornbread and was very tasty.  It also came with steak fries and I ordered collard greens.  The greens were the only disappointment.  They were a bit bland.  We had to try a dessert as they were all homemade and again, we were not let down.  We ordered the strawberry pound cake and it melted in your mouth!  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
