{"text":"Had the beef shawarma - dry chunked beef,  chewy, got stuck in my teeth. Shawarma has to be flaked not chunked. bland, had a boiled taste. Worse, I got sick after eating here, pretty bad runs. Avoid at all costs!!! I much prefer shawarma at Ghazale, Ali Baba or Paramount."}
{"text":"BREAKING NEWS!!! Sylvester Stallone serves Shawarmas!

Actually, the Falafel is my favorite here, fried fresh after you order, and still hot and crisp when you bite into it. You can choose from generous servings of Tabouli, lettuce/spinach salad, get the garlic sauce and/or hummus, and a few other things but it's the freshness of the food made by the mom+son team that takes me back here every few days.

At Shawarma+pop+satisfaction for $5, it's one of the best deals in town! Check it out...you'll get the Stallone reference."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster, the food is not even worth 5 dollars. Might as well take it to subway, the place is extremely dirty and needs pest control. The floors, utensils, counters needed a serious deep clean. If you notice the staff don't look clean either, if you're serving food and working in a kitchen have some pride. If the kitchen looks dirty, you know the food is not handled properly."}
{"text":"Got transferred to B.C. a few years ago,use to go to Eat A Pita a few times a week when I lived there.I ASKED THE STAFF IN MY OFFICE ABOUT WANTING TO GO THERE FOR LUNCH.EVERYONE SAID THEY DON'T GO THERE ANYMORE. So I WENT THERE BY MYSELF. MAN THIS PLACE WENT DOWN HILL!!! 1ST CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS THE WORST!(there was a older guy Cliff he was like a ray of sunshine even on the most miserable day we were having) There was always a joke in the line up and my old office we say anyone going over to pick up a shawarma and dose of Cliff. He would have a smile and greeting that even a customers who could be having the worst days of there lives smile and feel better by time they left. The guy that runs the place was swearing about the phone ringing , the other staff when a customer asked for extra sauce on there rice was like they were being a real bothersome! I GOT THE BEEF SHARAWA PLATE. Was dried beef that was boiled in a pot in the back ... RICE HAD A ODD SMELL LIKE IT WAS RANCID!..LETTUS WAS WILTED AND BROWN!!!! Price still the same. Went over to the mall to eat it and threw it in the garbage .The plate was like Eat A Pita  GONE TO THE GARBAGE !!!.The food was like it was a day or more older and felt like I WAS A BOTHER TO BEING CUSTOMER ! The place LOOKED DIRTY AND RUN DOWN RATHER DEPRESSIVE LIKE THE STAFF. Went back to the office and asked the staff about there experience they all said after Cliff the place has not been the same..WAS ONCE A GREAT PLACE FOR THE FOOD AND YOUR SOUL ..NO LONGER!! WALKED BY THERE LATE LAST NITE SEE 5 MICE!!1 5 MICE RUNNING AROUND THE STORE  WINDOW..RUN AWAY FROM A PLACE THAT IS A DUMP!"}
{"text":"First visit: came before 3PM, ordered the Shawarma plate for $5. Rice was bland. Potatoes were bland. Chicken was dry. Gentleman working behind the counter took lettuce out of some box on the ground, did not wash it, immediately began cutting it and threw it on my plate. Very disappointed. Cheap food, cheaper service was what was going through my mind. 

Decided to give this place a second try... 

Second visit: ordered the Shawarma plate again, decided to use my first experience as the bench mark.. lol.. decided to sit inside on those weird stools and eat. Food was okay for $5.. while eatting though, that gentlemen who's always there serving... yelled at his employee saying \"ayyyyy I told you to call those pest control guys... these things are runnin around everywhere\".... well I dont know what those \"things\" were.... but I did notice that I had bitten into something that had a weird crunch and did not taste like chicken.. or rice... or potatoes... or salad... 

Never returning again..."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite location in Toronto for shawarma. The owner takes care to ask what your exact preferences are for your wraps and platters. The portions, particularly of the vegetable toppings, are generous and the price cannot be beat at this location or any other. I tend to favour the chicken shawarma plate for the lunch special, for $5. I have also had the falafel wrap, which is fantastic since owner freshly fries the fritters for each order.

I only wish they had a bit more seating available since I usually like to eat wherever it is I order my food. The counter seats only four people, which is my only concern."}
{"text":"Five BUCKS (no tax) for a shawarma plate, falafel, or pita. Sylvester Stallone is the shawarma nazi here, DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY INTO HIS EYES. Sylvester will give you extras if you ask, but I don't recommend it or you may be banished forever."}
{"text":"We had the Beef and Falafel Shawarma and it was great. The staff was really friendly. The price was low (around 5 $ with a drink) for the area and the quality of the food. You can eat it there or bring it easly with you.

Everything was fresh prepared and was made with love.
Would definatly go here again."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken shawarma, really cheap as it is $5 with drinks and tax included. Can't say it was delicious, but it kept me full enough for the whole evening..."}
{"text":"$4.75 (tax in) for a Chicken/Beef shwarma sandwich!

The shwarma is just right in terms of size. You won't be stuffed, but you will be content - which is good to avoid food-coma at work.

The shwarma isn't overloaded, like I tend to see in many shwarma places in GTA. Since it's not overloaded, you can taste all the ingredients together for a tasty experience. This is the way it is supposed to be, at least this is how it was when I lived in Saudi Arabia for a number of years.

Tthe Chicken isn't seasoned/marinated too well, but I don't mind as I prefer less salty to over salty. 

All in all, very pleasant meal. I'll definitely be returning here in the future!"}
{"text":"What more can you say. $4.50 lunch special in the Y&B neighborhood, made fresh to order with a pop? I get the falafel everytime. It is delicious. They are a little slow, but they make the falafel balls as you order, so its worth it. Always packed expect a line out the door. 

Honestly, much higher quality than most falafel places. Huge portion, good value and Excellent sauce. (is it cinnamon? I cannot crack the code)"}
{"text":"Oh, how I adore this place and their outstanding lunch special! As others have noted, it's 5$ taxes in for a descent sized chicken schwarma and a drink. You can. Not. Beat. That.

They serve fast and friendly. Awesome staff, awesome food. My only complaint is no weekend hours. But this place is a jewel among the overpriced Yonge/Bloor lunch fare. 

Avoid the lunch hour and avoid lineups. But still... they keep the line moving fast. Worth all five stars."}
{"text":"My first review, and for a place that really deserves a 5-star review.
Eat A Pita is an amazing place with prices and service that match it's qualities, now you may be asking: \"what's so amazing about this place, it's just shawarmas\". It's better than that, they're the best damn shawarams I've had in my life. In conclusion, just go here!"}
{"text":"Chicken that came with the plate was tough and dry and the salads had too much vinegar. Also, the beef wasn't very good either. It's priced right and you do get a good amount of food. 

Service was fast but presentation is poor - dark and rough inside. Very limited seating - for take out."}
{"text":"I would have never gone here or heard of this place if it weren't for the rave reviews on Yelp. I decided to stop there for lunch today because I was craving a shawarma sammich. My favourite place is Liberty Shawarma in Liberty Village. This place was on par -- really delish and the price was a steal! $5 for a chicken shawarma sammich + can of pop. 

This place is just a little hole in the wall with limited bar sitting but I am looking forward to coming back here in the future. Another plus was the guy serving me washed his hands with soap and water before making my shawarma. That's good to know especially with flu season coming up."}
{"text":"Don't mind if I do! 

I heard about this place by overhearing a conversation and I'm glad I eavesdropped! The tiny place has every one of its seats filled and oozes authenticity. 

This is not your run of the mill shwarma shack. No, these sandwiches are shown some love. The woman that puts them together makes sure she's spread out the onions, the tomatoes, everything. Doesn't it suck when you get stagnant bites of just one thing? None of that anymore! Even distribution, people. It makes a big difference. 

What about the taste, Danielle F? The chicken shwarma meat was well seasoned and juicy and let's just says I could feel the texture of every little leaf of parsley in the tabouli because it was so fresh. 

So yes, it takes a bit longer than your average place where they just smash it all together but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Not bad, the falafel was pretty good but the service left a lot to be desired in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing Eat a Pita for a long time now. It always seems to have long lines of people waiting outside. 

I finally decided to check this place out. It's a tiny little shop with people working behind the counter including an extremely friendly man who seemed to know everyone that walked in and happily chatted away to all of them while he prepared everyone's order.

I walked in to find a long line of men in front of me. Not a woman in sight which made me a little bit nervous (what did they know that I didn't?). I ordered the $5 lunch special (chicken, rice, a salad and a few veggies, tahini sauce, hot sauce, watery salad dressing and barely recognizable tzatziki sauce that comes from a giant tub.

This place is not for you germaphones, I found a hair in my meal, but the food was decent. Having said that, the lunch market around here is competitive and I'd rather spend my money at Picnic or Salad Days. 

I understand the draw, decent portion, very friendly staff, quick service and a price you really can't beat, but this place just wasn't my cup of tea, even if it was just $5 including tax."}
{"text":"Eat a Pita is probably one of the most popular lunchtime spots in Yorkville. They offer a wicked $5 lunch special (shawarma wrap + drink or shawarma plate) creating long queues at around noon.  The owners/employees are very nice and the portion sizes are very, very reasonable for the price. I personally ordered the shawarma plate and the chicken was tender and the salad was very tasty. Definitely will be a part of my regular lunchtime spots. They even accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"Man, I've been on this street so many times and had it not been for Yelp would've never given this place a second glance! Good call by Adeel - yeah, it's definitely a Stallone's clone, even the voice is similar, though at least 25 years younger. Did Stallone participate in a sperm donation program?
So far I've tried only the chicken Shawarma and I'd easily give it 4 stars. Properly marinated, flavourful, fresh... What's not to like? And the $5 deal is indeed hard to beat. Plus now they have a large chicken shawarma for $7 and a beef one for $8, though the regular size was more than enough to sate my appetite. I'm definitely coming back and next time I'm trying their Falafel, and if turns out as good as the other reviewers say I'll update it to 5 stars."}
{"text":"My go to for lunch when I have the time to line up.  There's always a line up unless there is a blizzard. 

Nothing beats a $5 healthy, hearty lunch. I get the chicken or beef lunch salad - meat, rice, potatoes and salad. The owner is great at making accommodations; I usually skip the rice and potatoes and just order the salad and meat.

The greens are always fresh, I mean how can they not be when there is so much volume at the door. The shawarma meat is a hit or miss, I've had extremely dry beef a few times, not as often with the chicken but hey $5 lunch, can't complain too much about it.

Eat here for lunch, worth the 10 minute line up."}
{"text":"Yorkville is not an easy place to find a cheap good eat. This is an awesome place for that and is my go to place when I want tasty food on a budget. $5 for either a plate (with a lot of food might I add) or a wrap/pop combo. 

I've had the chicken, beef and falafel and all of them great! May look like (and is to a degree) a whole in the wall, but the food is good and the guys who work there are awesome!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma here is excellent! The chicken is flavourful and juicy plus they have a daily special of a chicken shawarma and drink for 5$. Just a note this place is tiny so don't expect to dine in, although they have a few stools if you're solo or with a friend and want to grab a quick bite. They also close at 6pm during the week - I happened to make it just in time. Sorry, no pic, I downed that thing before I could even! :)"}
{"text":"I came here on the strength of the recommendations here on yelp and because I was shocked that there would be a place for $5 meals in Yorkville.  I don't know whether I was overly hyped by the reviews or maybe there's just something wrong with me... but I really didn't feel that the chicken shawarma was anything special.

The shawarma was huge!  The ingredients were plentiful indeed.  I have to say that between me and the shawarma, I lost and couldn't finish it.  Taste-wise... I can't say that this is the best shawarma that I've ever had.  Again, maybe I was just over-hyped?  The $5 came with a drink as well, and juice isn't extra compared to soda.  Bonus!

As expected, the lunchtime line was loooong and it was funny that I overheard some people measuring the time it look from ordering to actually receiving the food.  

The owners are super friendly and because of their attitude, I would have to say they made the lunchtime experience much more enjoyable.  So thank you, and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"It's a little lunch hole in the wall near Yonge and Bloor St and set themselves apart from others in the falafel department by frying them right there in front of you. Talk about fresh! The shawarma is excellently seasoned, made with care, and the sandwich/pop special is $5. Win!

When I worked in the area, I used to eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"BEST shawarma I've ever had. Actually it was one of my first shawarmas and I haven't found anything this good since. The hot sauce and tahani sauce are sooo tasty, and the veggie toppings are always fresh.

And you cannot beat the price. $5 (taxes included) for a chicken shawarma + pop/bottle of water! Other places usually charge extra for water in any combo. 

LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"This used to be my \"oh man, I need a shawrma but only have $5, where do I go\" place.  

However, many competitors have opened up recently (Ali Baba, Hayden Lunch house, etc.) in the area.  

What I like about this place: Cheap, and fresh meat (during lunch time)
What I dislike: Come after 4 pm, and it's not as cheap and the meat seems dry and stale.

Verdict: Great for lunch, but not the best after that. Try any of the shawrmas when they are fresh and they are very good."}
{"text":"The Food:
I had the chicken wrap and although it was a bit smaller than some of the places where I've had it, it's very tasty. The combination of everything that they put it is is just perfect.

The Place:
A hole in the wall with very limited seating. When my boyfriend and I went, all the seats were occupied so we decided to walk to a nearby park and enjoy our wrap.

The Service:
It seems like there's always a line up at this place. That in itself attests to how good it is. However, the wait isn't very long and was worth it.

The Verdict:
I would go here again. They have a $5 chicken wrap and drink special. Score!"}
{"text":"They just relocated to maple vaughan near wonderland, awesome fresh home made food big portions and very good prices. I always have breakfast and dinner."}
{"text":"Wow...great lunch deals at $5.  Absolutely delicious chicken shwarma plate at a very inexpensive price point - in Yorkville no less - what more is there to say, except you need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Just thinking about this place makes me drool like Homer Simpson. Sooooo goooood.

I have only ever had the shawarma there because they are perfection. Seriously. And so cheap. Shawarma dinner is plentiful, with rice, potato and salad, so I generally just get the shawarma pita which comes with a drink (and by drink I mean can of pop) for $5. You can't beat that. And everybody knows it, cause often at lunchtime the line up at this tiny place is out the door.
The shawarma comes topped with onions, lettuce, etc, hot sauce if you want, and the best garlic mayo sauce ever. Droooooool....

There are only 2 stools in the window. This place is strictly take-out.

4 stars only because of the waits. They need to expand the place and increase the staff, but the food itself is so good."}
{"text":"Lunch special: $5 chicken shawarma platter (before 3pm).

I've tried this place a couple of times for lunch. There's always a line-up during lunch. I'd say the wait time is about 5-10 minutes.
The food is okay, don't expect much flavour. The platter comes with a plain salad and white rice. The chicken shawarma was neither hot or fresh - which was strange because he cut it just before serving mine. 
I always need their 'tzatziki' sauce and 'hot' sauce, but both are still bland tasting. Salt and pepper are a must.

I'll admit that it is good value for lunch at $5 flat, but that's the only thing they've got going."}
{"text":"Cheap eats . $5 shawarma and pop deal is great. Family owned business and their service is great. 

4.25/5 *"}
{"text":"Basically, fantastic food and great price - love the simple feel of the place and that it is genuinely a family-run business (eg Mum and Son working the Shawarmas).  I've had a lot of Shawarmas and Shish Taouks (especially in Montreal, where Boustan has to be one of the best), but this place really stands out."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for years and finally writing a review well deserved.

Love the owner takes great pride in his restaurant and make a huge effort to remember his regulars. Amazing guy.

The line up outside of this small gem during the week goes around the shop which is understandable food is fresh, wraps are filled with the right amount of meat to salad/toppings gives the customer value for his money.5 bucks get you either chicken or beef wrap with a pop and they say there is no such thing as a free meal!!!

Took my cousin here for a quick bite on a Saturday he was over from England and loved it as well wanted to go back before he left but time did not allow.

The restaurant is very clean and if you go later near to close you will see the owner scrub down everything the way a restaurant should be run.

Keep up the great work!!!

The only downside - Wished it was open later :) cant have everything."}
{"text":"it's just 5 dolla  but it's so healthy and always fresh. very good and fast service and the stuff is so helpful . you have to try it"}
{"text":"Given its location in Yorkville, it's insane to be able to find lunch options for under $5. 

If I am in the area, and looking for something cheap, I would come here and order the $5 chicken sharwma plate. Most of the time the chicken is juicy, but I have had one bout where the chicken and rice were dry. 

Service is fast. Very limited seating available."}
{"text":"came here today and got the chicken shwarma and it was amazing! Great service and the price is really the best selling point. I loved the sauce but i wish the chicken had little bit more flavor. All in all it was well worth it and I will come back again as long as they keep the prices."}
{"text":"3.5/5 to be honest.

I used to eat here at lunch very frequently, getting beef or chicken shwarmas, and it was always great for a long long time.  After a while though, the beef (and sometimes the chicken) started to be very dry, and then portion sizes started to decrease.

Went back for the first time in a while today.  Unfortunately portion size is still down from what I remember it use to being.  Still tastes great, and they're still super nice guys, but I was hoping for more.

Will I go back?  Sure.  $5 for a shwarma and pop (incl tax) is a great deal.  Would I go a lot more often if they went back to how it used to be?  For sure."}
{"text":"This is the best schwarma i have ever had. And for only $5! I have been coming here since 2008 and i don't think they have ever raised their prices. So good, so friendly. Couldn't recommend highly enough!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and I come here at least once a week, sometimes twice. This place offers a big plate of food for $5! Yes, $5!!!! All inclusive in the heart of Yorkville surrounded by posh shops.

Their taste isn't extraordinary or out of this world but it's wayyyyy beyond good for its value. 

Do come early for lunch (before noon) or else you'll be greeted with a 15 people lineup. By 1pm most of the choices will have sold out so come early!

(Try the eggplants, they're amazing)"}
{"text":"Holy crap $5 for a falafel plate for lunch? in Yorkville? omg, it is too cheap to believe!

The portion is massive and they fry their falafel on the spot. I just hope the falafel itself was bigger in size. Or you can pay $1 for 3 more falafel.

Good stuff and finally I can eat cheap around this expensive area."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and decided to stop by.

Sure the 5$ shawarma + pop sounds good but I question the shawarma. I Ordered the bigger shawarma (7$). I wanted to add fries but they said they are out of fries (no effort to make new fries). The shawarma...was very skinny. The amount of beef they placed in the large shawarma I ordered was very stingy and it felt like I was eating more bread than protein. Also the protein came from some tub...

MAYBE the plates would be better but that's something I have to try next time. Can't really give a higher rating coz I have tasted better shawarma."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the armpit of Yorkville, behind Cumberland Terrace, Eat A Pita is designed for people like us; you know, the types who while away bored hours at work microblogging about restaurants.

Every morning, I pass Eat a Pita as  walk to my office and wonder:

1) Is this place still open?
2) Who eats here?
3) Is this some kind of mobbed up tax dodge?
4) When do the condos go up? (Yorkville needs more condos).

Forlorn signs announce the daily specials- Middle Eastern standards like Shawarma, Falafel, and everything you wanted to know about eggplant but were afraid to ask. Faded photos promise a feast in the window, yet mask a dreary brown-on-brown hole, with a short steam table and cramped cash register. 

The physical space is almost an afterthought; a grudging reminder of Ontario's ridiculous anti-street-food bylaws. One wishes that places like Eat A Pita would lead a falafel intifada against our oppressive city-state. But I digress...

After hearing enough foodie friends raving about this place, and following careful monitoring of internet dining review  forums *ahem* I am convinced that Eat A Pita is the ultimate in informal dining.  I put on my Anthony Bourdain boots, saddle up and ride, for a new culinary adventure awaits. 

At lunch, Eat A Pita is an entirely different place. The décor is still nonexistent, but the tiny joint is packed, and a line snakes out the door. The air inside smells of garlic and grease, and you jostle your way to the counter, where some sleepy-eyed tattooed dude takes your order.

Be careful when you ask for one of the posted specials. Like your mom probably told you when you failed miserably at piano, or baseball, or math, everything is \"special\". One day, instead of the sizzling chicken shawarma, I am greeted with sinewy, veinous beef cooked grey on a flat-top. No attempt is made to fix the miscommunication. The chopped veg, tabbouleh and garlic sauce make the sandwich passable.

To give peace a chance, I return the next day for the chicken version. I'm glad I did; the meat is a happy yellow; bathed in its own fat and juices, and crispy bronze where it came closest to the heat.

A third visit produces a vegetarian plate and disappointment. Falafel balls are fried in front of me, yet go soggy quickly. They are salty and dry. Cauliflower has wilted on the steam-table, and lentils and rice fail to inspire, though they may win praise from anemic vegetarians for their \"complete protein\" combo. I'll get my amino acids elsewhere, thanks. Again, the salad is the star, along with rich and smokey eggplant.

As foodie finds go, Eat-a-Pita wins by setting low expectations for ambiance and price. No meal costs more than $7, including a can of soda, which is a steal for Yorkville. If one is looking for a place to park one's BMW and enjoy a more refined meal, there are plenty of options nearby."}
{"text":"This used to be my playground... this used to be my childhood dream...

I stopped into Eat-A-Pita after many months away. This place used to be my best-kept Yorkville lunch secret. A shawarma platter to rival any other place's, for only five bucks. But they appear to have figured out that they don't need to lay out the red carpet for the line that continues to snake out the door. My five bucks didn't get me much today. A scant half cup of chicken, some green lettuce (no tomatoes or other salad vegetables, not even a bit of tabbouleh) and... yep, that's potato salad. To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. I'd like to think this is a one-off but somehow, I doubt it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm having mediocre potato salad for lunch and must get to it."}
{"text":"Great spot in Yorkville for an extremely cheap (but filling!) lunch. 5 bucks (taxes in) gets you a shawarma plate. It's not loaded but everything is super tasty and the portions are reasonable. Skip the beef and get the more popular chicken shawarma. There's usually a long line at noon but it goes quickly enough. There are stools for sitting at the window but no one does that. Just grab and go!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the only place I know where I can eat lunch and feel satisfied until dinner for $5. I always get the chicken plate at lunch, and though I'm not as regular as a lot of their customers, they remember me. And they have a LOT of regulars. Expect a line out the door from 11:45 to 2:00. But it's healthy, delicious, and hearty. The service is a well oiled machine, with a few bumps this summer as they had some younger help in."}
{"text":"3-1/2 STARS.

After hearing tons of great reviews from my friends and on Yelp, and on the hunt for a great falafel, I decided to give it a try.
I went on the weekend, which I didn't experience any lines at all.

The person running the place was very friendly and appreciative. 

For less than $5 you get a falafel sandwich with a drink, which is a great deal especially in this neck of the woods.
However I wasn't that impressed with my falafel. Maybe I had high expectations to begin with. It was a good falafel, not dry at all.
The pieces of onion was cut a little too large for my liking, and the faint nutmeg seasoning was unexpected and not really to my liking. The hot sauce seems like it was merely tobasco sauce and watery.
For $5 it is a decent falafel."}
{"text":"Great pitas for for $5! It doesn't get any better!!!

It's a bit out of my way from work, but I like to come here every now and then for lunch. The service is fast and their pitas delicious!

The place is tiny, literally, there's only 1 table and a few bar stools. Perfect for take out on your lunch break!"}
{"text":"It's been a while, but had to make a review about this place.

Come here during lunch time between 10:30-3pm and you'll get an awesome deal.  A chicken shawarmaa plate or a chicken wrap with pop for $5 tax in.. As stated by a few others, because of the lower turnover after 3pm quality does drop.  

But if you work around in the area or happen to be in the neighborhood, it's a good option if you're hungry and feel like shawarma.  It'll fill you and the guys are pretty nice. Of course this isn't the best shawarma available but it's $5, so let's be reasonable.

The #BallerOnABudget in me says, this is a mega win.  Can't beat $5 for a good and filling lunch. Enjoy guys. =)"}
{"text":"I honestly do not understand how there is a line here everyday. I went to see what all the hype was, and I got this horribly sad plate of food. There's literally 2-3 pieces of nasty \"chicken schwarma\" and what looks and tastes like overcooked uncle bens microwaveable rice. They added a gross mayo garlic sauce to it. No potato, no meat.. just a gloopy plate of food. The container was also 1/3 full and when I said \"wait that's it!?\" The guy said for 1.50 extra I can get extra meat. I don't understand how all the rich people in this area can go here, it's super cheap, and kind of gross. The chicken tastes like boiled chicken. This place may have used to be a good value, but they realize they don't need to do much to get people lining up for a $5 lunch. Go to salad house instead! 5 minutes away!"}
