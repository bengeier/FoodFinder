{"text":"This diner is awful! The ambiance is non-existent; the lights are never on, which adds to the sullen feel of the place. First walking in I noticed the mountains of Minnie Mouse memorabilia piled up in heaps behind the counter. There is a decent dining area, I will give them that, but this place is never packed. The booths and bar stools are nice and uniform and don't look bad at all, but placed in such a sad looking restaurant really brings down their appeal.      I commend the owners for welcoming me into the diner so late in the day - I slipped in about 15 minutes before closing - but the good stops there. I ordered the french toast and home fries on the side, but was told that coffee was not served so late. After settling down in a booth, I fiddled around for a while in silence while I waited for my food. The hostess was not at all talkative and I have no idea how anyone was able to get any conversation out of her, maybe it was because it was late in the day? When my plate arrived I looked down to take in the contents, not impressed. The portions were very small, three minuscule pieces of french toast, crusts off, and a tiny portion of home fries which were squished onto the side of the plate. The quality of the food did nothing to change my mind of the place. Everything was soggy, the potatoes were salvaged with some ketchup but the underdone french toast was just a bust. The food was cheap though, coming in at exactly $6.50, but the quality was reflective of this.      I was here once before and had ordered the fish and chips. The service wasn't too much better and neither was the food. The fish and chips were clearly frozen, expected of a diner. But the thing I took most offence to was the salad, which was still wet! The one thing this diner has going for it is the location, great family friendly neighbourhood and no other greasy spoons around for a few blocks, but I say just take the few extra minutes to walk to a decent diner."}
{"text":"I am actually quite shocked that there are so many reviews for Collegiate Lunch, given that every time I am in there the only other people look like they probably don't own a computer and, if they do, it's certainly not connected to the internet (i.e., they are old).   The food here is fine, but really cheap, and the service is good. You can get a full breakfast for under $5. It's 100% diner style with the classic counter and booths. I don't make it here as often as I would like because my girlfriend likes a bit of a higher class/three times the price brunch. In the rare situation where I am going it alone and out for breakfast this is where I go. I'll be the loser sitting by himself reading the paper."}
{"text":"A local introduced me to Minnie and she remembered my name from then on. She knew how I liked my coffee and eggs after the second.   This place was nostalgic in the 80's, now I don't know what to call it. Unassuming for sure, it's down to basics Gerrard St East restaurant.  If you enjoy the traditional diner feel, wholesome food served quickly, a great price and caring service with an honest smile then Minnie and her husband will provide it. From bacon and eggs at breakfast or burgers, sandwiches or soup at lunch, Colligate Lunch is a neighbourhood diamond in the rough.   I just don't know why the local tradesmen haven't discovered it. This is a perfect place for them to get a quick bite, break or take-out... and avoid that 'M' place down the street that serves less food, lower quality at a higher price.  Thank you Minnie. See you soon."}
{"text":"Great, cheap, and friendly. This restaurant is a hidden gem and the owner Minnie will make you feel at home."}
{"text":"I just headed down to Collegiate Lunch but it's shuttered - green garbage bags carefully cover the window and glass door - looks like it's down for the count on a rapidly gendrifying strip."}
{"text":"I heard about collegiate lunch as being a great breakfast place...three of my buddies meet on a regular basis between the east end and the west end, taking turns to accommodate the distances that each has to travel...When we got there at 8 am, there was a sign that it doesn't open till 8:30 during the week...We patiently waited and waited and waited until 10 to 9 and the place was still closed...We left, thinking that should it open anytime soon, it would be a while before the coffee was brewed and the grills heated up...I doesn't seem like this place is a serious breakfast place."}
{"text":"Met my usual \"colleagues\" for our weekly Monday breakfast this Tuesday, and we were all taken by this neighborhood 'spoon. Minnie, the current proprietress, tells us that this establishment is ~70 years old, and she's been here for the past 10.  She's friendly and efficient.  The breakfast was a deal! 4.75 for 3 (small) eggs, choice of the standard 3 meats, home fries, toast and coffee.  'Twas all good...the bacon was ironed flat, and the coffee was above average.  Minnie tells us she pays a lot for it, and she grinds it for every pot.  Go for the good breakfast, linger for the collection of Minnie Mouse toys!"}
{"text":"The food is great,  owners Minnie and John are very friendly. Great breakfast place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"we often spend much time keeping abreast of the newest bar or restaurant thats opening in our neighbourhood.   we pique at the sight of a real estate sign advertising the potential for a fresh new look, taste, or class of thing to come.  when the sign comes down, we know someones taken the bait and as the construction inside begins, we scour the window to find a sliver uncovered so we may peek inside for the insiders view.  finally, when it opens we talk about it to our friends, if we are bold we check it out before the reviews, if not then after and then the mystique turns into whether itll last or not.  well, there are some places in our neighbourhoods that have conquered those hurdles like a president conquers a racial divide, like our ingenuity conquers great depressions, like love conquers all, i suppose.    one of those places, in my neighbourhood, is called The Collegiate Lunch.  unassuming, it marks its territory with a simple white and blue sign.  Perhaps the most telling mark of its age is its choice of the word \"collegiate\".   have you ever heard anyone use that word before?   though ive passed by the \"collegiate\" many a time, i have only gone as far as a peak inside with hands cupped around my eyes and forehead stuck to the glass.  but today, a day after a night of drinking, a day that came equipped with a mild yet uncomfortable headache, a day that when i shouldnt be talking to anyone, was a PERFECT day to crack this bottle open, as it were.  so inside i went, sat at the first table, a booth and was greeted immediately by Minnie.  Minnie is the owner of this place (perhaps with her husband, not sure).  i only know her name because i went for a massage afterwards and my therapist told me her name.  that fact seemed to become glaringly obvious when i remembered that the back wall of the diner behind the bar is filled with Minnie Mouses of different sizes and colours.    the fare they have is standard diner, but it is the feeling and company thats shared that makes this place a nice little greasy spoon.  I ordered their banquet burger with fries converted into the classic poutine.  a perfect meal for the hungover inside all of us.    with nothing to do while i was waiting i felt at ease walking up to another patron to ask for the crossword puzzle in the paper if she wasnt interested.  she obliged, and a woman sitting at another table directed me to the remainder of the paper which was sitting just by the bar.  as i left, i took the puzzle with me, but gave the rest to another lonesome soldier who was sitting in the opposite booth from me, enjoying his classic meal.  and so once again, this little lunchbox endures as a place of regulars, regular good food, regular prices and a collegial warmth and serves as a lesson that a little kindness and care goes a long way."}
{"text":"This place is truly a gem.  I used to go to the high school in the the area and I've always thought this place was a lame bar that tried to lure students to come by calling it \"collegiate lunch\" after the school name.  Then I went to try it because I was tired of all the fried chicken I had been eating at the places in the area, and let me tell you it was fantastic!  It's not a bar, but just a simple lunch place.   The server, Minnie was very memorable and was super friendly to us.  As a teen that's dining out at a place with service, I found that that was rare.  For around $5 plus taxes, we got coffee/tea, and a whole big breakfast meal with bacon, eggs, toast, home fries, sausages.    After high school, I've been back and everything is the exact same, even the price.  I swear this place is operating at a loss.  I did notice that they don't serve coffee/tea anymore after 11am, but it's still a stellar deal.  Don't judge the restaurant by what it looks like on the outside!"}
{"text":"I eat at a lot of cheap diners.  This one is exceptionally reasonably priced.  For a bacon and eggs breakfast and a french toast breakfast with coffees it was under 15$ including tax and tip.   But it just isn't as good as other cheap diners.  I would rather pay $20 for something made with higher quality ingredients.   The good: - 3 eggs - 4 strips of bacon - meh to okay hashbrowns (It's hard to impress me with your hashbrowns.  I'm the first to admit it.)  The flatline: - the eggs were not poached like poached eggs should be... see the photo Kat posted (that was my breakfast) - they were poached in little containers that I think probably floated in water to poach the eggs... it wasn't really poached like poached eggs are supposed to be poached. - the hashbrowns weren't crispy but they did have a nice flavour - cheap bacon (but a big serving) - acceptable coffee but no coffee after 1100 on weekdays and 1400 on weekends  My summary of the all day breakfast at the Collegiate Lunch is that it's a cheap meal of cheap ingredients and it's not that great.  I will probably come back here but I might try something else like a western or peameal sandwich.  I would rather eat at Bus Terminal Diner at a comparable price point."}
{"text":"An unassuming little diner that's great for a quick bite. The prices are insanely cheap, the staff is friendly and the food is actually quite good.  I had a BLT with a side order of poutine that was outstanding. Total cost for two lunches (with sides and drinks)? About $15.  Bonus points for the guy whose order was started before he had even sat down; this place knows its regulars!"}
