{"text":"Picked this stop randomly for breakfast on the way out of town and it was just great. Nice folks and I wish we could've been around for the BBQ later. I'm sure it was top notch as well."}
{"text":"So happy we came here! Just far enough to not be super crowded. We drove up and were confused by the exterior but so happy we went in! Super nice and clean and new, super friendly staff and even better food! Totally worth a visit."}
{"text":"What more can I say fresh food made from scratch . First time here and I will be a returning customer the staff was very welcoming and polite. The food is fresh and really good . Construction zones are a little rough around this area but it's worth it ."}
{"text":"Love this hole in the wall restaurant!  Great BBQ and Pie, great service, great price. I work pretty close so I try to make here as often as possible, usually always have leftovers too.  Always worth the stop, but I always want a nap after!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing BBQ in a small time diner. Everything from the building to the waitresses to the food is absolutely amazing and exactly where you want to be eating a big ol' amazing plate of BBQ food. The cornbread is probably the most amazing I've had since leaving Tennessee."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the tri-tip sandwich. The spicy mustard and homemade vinegar slaw really make the sandwich!"}
{"text":"The place looks like a dive and is not for everyone.  The BBQ is amazing!  Had the ribs, brisket, and beans with rice.  Me buddy had the rib tip sandwich with fries.  Both were excellent.  For value, go with the the rib tip sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place to go for some BBQ. You name it they got it. Delicious and affordable. You can smell the smoker in the back cooking up the goodies. Had the pull pork, sausage and rib convo with there mac and cheese side. It was delicious. It's a little hard to find when you first go there but you'll be happy you did. Highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Empty, dirty, run down, in ghetto, industrial area. The place looks abandoned. We were confused and bewildered. 

How the hell it got more reviews and better ratings than Denny's, which is just down the block and completely packed, inviting, with all kinds of Halloween decorations for the kids... is a complete mystery. Someone's cheating on their reviews. 

Holy hell we rolled up and it was a truck driver's ghost town. For fear of zombies and food poisoning, we bolted after driving around the rundown and haggard establishment. 

Yelp... You may want to double, triple and quadruple check the origin and legitimacy of these bogus ratings. 

Hate to write a bad review... But there's no way the current reviews and ratings support what we just experienced."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. If you are not careful, you may drive right passed it. I did initially.  The server was friendly and fun. Omelets were awesome. Waffles were awesome. Biscuits and gravy were almost like Mom's."}
{"text":"Have eatin here a few times and been treated really well by Celeste. By far the best part is the cooking by Kim."}
{"text":"It had a very nice feel to it even though it was in like a secluded area the outside looks a little sketchy but the inside was really nice the food was okay nothing I would have to have again but it wasn't disgusting either I had a burger and my boyfriend had the wings despite the food the service was terrific the staff there is really friendly"}
{"text":"Great food and great
Service!! Mike has a passion for the food and it shows! He is always open to feedback and likes to try new things!"}
{"text":"Too be honest this place is in the middle of nowhere. On the out side it looks like an old truck stop, but on the inside it looks like an average dinner.

I had gotten the pulled pork sandwich and it was great,but the best part was the fries."}
{"text":"We ate here for breakfast and had an awesome meal. Super good food and friendly fast service at a fair price. What more could you ask for?? My biscuit was HUGE and delicious! Pancakes were fluffy and tasty. Eggs cooked to perfection and cool cut potatoes. Good coffee to top it off. Just go here!

{"text":"Had the smoked pastrami sammi and it was insane !!!! House smoked beans and rice were crazy good !!!"}
{"text":"Just walk in! Trust me! Celeste & Arlena were so welcoming & really kind to my family & I. 

You can smell the BBQ outside. I got the smoked chicken wings! MACKIN"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ and exceptional service! Celeste was very friendly and treated us just like family!! We will be back to try more! We had the ribs, briskett, and pulled pork.....YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic diner / truck stop, at a very reasonable price. Spinach mushroom swiss omelet for breakfast was so good that I went back the same day for lunch.  BBQ sandwich was even better, with excellent pork, nice bun, good sauce, and good coleslaw.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY sweet staff and the food is to die for!! You will smell the goodness before you hit the door! This is a must!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm great burgers frys n omelets... Big portions a shower if you stink and a car and semi truck wash everyone's super friendly..."}
{"text":"My favorite little hole in the wall. Try to make it there at least once a week and have never been disappointed. The BBQ is some of the best I've had and the portions are nappy time big. The pastrami sandwich is off the hook!! Mike and his team are super friendly and really care about their customers. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and awesome food. Wife had the country eggs Benedict and pancakes for me, both were excellent."}
{"text":"SNS Diner never disappoints and serves AMAZING brisket, RIBS pulled pork, smoked chicken and much much more. I always get one of the Sandwiches for lunch which is my favorite composed of sliced smoked brisket and barbecue sauce served inside a Kaiser roll because I'm a plain jane bbq guy, but you can also  get it loaded with all the fixing if you like,  They have plenty of sides as well my favorites are the beans and the French fries but some of my friends always get the mac and cheese.
. 
On certain days the owner Mike also makes some homemade Smoked gumbo from a secret recipe or his classic home style chili and homemade cornbread is outstanding,  you just have to call ahead to see if he has made any that day or its not already sold out . Mike also does other specials including homemade smoked hot links as well or some times turkey or ham.

Bottom line I have eaten at a lot of BBQ joints around the US and overseas and SNS is the best in Las Vegas Hands down. I'm not sure why some people have given negative reviews on here but I have never had any problems and if I did Celeste Mike Sabrina or any of the staff have always taken care of me. I recommend everyone I meet to go try it,  Its a one-of-a-kind experience especially in Las Vegas to still have a quality locally owned non chain bbq joint that truly stands out in a very very small crowd.

Oh yeah almost forgot SNS also has a amazing breakfast menu get the biscuits and gravy!!! Oh and if you don't believe me call me at 702-365-1616 between 7-5

By the way if your having a hard time finding it go North on losse road coming from Cheyenne ave and take a left at the first stop light then keep you Eye out on the right for the BIG SNS diner sign on a small building just past the gas pumps. 

P.S. I was born and raised in Kansas City so I know quality good BBQ."}
{"text":"If your looking for good BBQ in Vegas go to Rollin' Smoke or Billy's. This place doesn't know the difference between fatty brisket and lean brisket. No smoke ring at all. The flavor wasn't there. It seems like it's ran like a fast food place instead of a real BBQ joint. Everything is proportioned and held until you order."}
{"text":"I was there 2 weeks agk. I had the ribs and lousiana link. My friend ordered the rib and brisket and my other friend ordered the smoked chicken and link.  The friend that had the link  and I got sick that night.  Took me 2 days to recover.  Th buddy that got the ribs and brisket didn't get sick."}
{"text":"Yelp has never let me down this bad before. The reviews for this place were great so I had to try it and it was absolutely disgusting. It was hard to find because it is just a shabby little building in a truck stop parking lot. I had expected that though because other reviews had commented on that but then went on to say how amazing the food was. That was not my experience. The place was filthy. The food was very mediocre. While I was eating a customer yelled \"that fly strip is f*****g disgusting\". I looked up and indeed there was a fly strip covered in dead flies that I had to view while I was eating. After my very mediocre potatoes and eggs I was enjoying a waffle that actually tasted very good. But when I got three of the four sections of the waffle eaten I noticed the long black hair on the plate. I moved it aside only to find three or four more hairs on my plate. I could not finish the fourth section of my waffle. I would recommend you stay very very far away from this place. When you see the building from the outside trust your instincts!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here w/ 2 friends. I had the smoked chicken wings- my friends had the half chicken meal and the pastrami burger. All 3 of us were stuffed but the taste of the food was so amazing that we immediately started talking about coming back the next day for lunch. This place is clean with great friendly service. The price was right on for the amount and quality of food. Oddly enough, SNS Diner looks like a truck stop ( it used to be) but the fresh and tasty food reminds me of what you might get at a fancy LV Strip BBQ restaurant. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Such great BBQ!!! I had the brisket sandwich with Mac and cheese everything was perfect!
The staff was friendly to!"}
{"text":"We stopped at this truck wash/diner after seeing it in tv.  I had the country eggs Benedict. It was the best gravy I have ever had. Friendly service, delicious food. Defiantly worth stopping for."}
{"text":"Ok I admit the outside looked sketchy but the inside is amazing. The food taste amazing. I got the ribs and brisket. Great seasoned. The peach cobbler is homemade and amazing. Great friendly service!"}
{"text":"Come check this place out, it's worth it!!!
If you're anywhere close by, or for that matter far away, and just looking for really good bbq, this is it!! I personally find it hard to find good brisket but this is some of the best!! Very moist, good smoke flavor but not overpowering or like eating a campfire at some places. This place is the epitome of a place that should be on diners, drive-ins and dives! 
Also had the beans and pulled pork.. ..Both awesome as well. I def want to try the ribs and hot link next time.The sauce (not on the meat which is a plus cuz I like to sauce it myself), is good but not great. 
We'll be back to this place for sure!"}
{"text":"We went here because of other reviews & were not disappointed. Our lunch was delicious and were pleased to find Gumbo as a special - yum! Ribs, brisket & pulled pork were perfect. Their sauce was just right as well. Portions were geneeous & we left satisfied, with leftovers. Definitely try this place! 4.5 on food but be warned, it is a truck stop - a very clean truck stop w/ friendly folks."}
{"text":"So delicious! Tucked away a little in a truck stop but well worth it. The food is great, BBQ is spectacular. All of the employees are very friendly and welcoming. We finished with the peach cobbler and it was perfect. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Those that judge this place by the outside/surrounding area and leave before giving the food a shot are fools! The joke is on you cause the food is fantastic. Yeah the outside needs some work but that BBQ is awesome! The staff is so friendly too!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Don't let the location fool you. The moment I walked in the door, I knew I was in for a treat just by the way it smelled. Everything is homemade except for the fries (which were delicious too). Pulled pork, shredded chicken, brisket, ribs, amazing potato salad, cobbler...need I say more??!!! I am a native Nevadan and this truly is the best BBQ in town. Super friendly employees, super casual setting, super delicious everything!! Give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yelp brought me here I hit this place up the other day the biscuits and gravy were really good it's true what they say on here the place looks closed down but it's not just walk in you won't be disappointed good ppl awsell"}
{"text":"Having eaten breakfast at SNS, which was good, we tried the lunch. Being from Texas I have BBQ sauce in my veins. All I can say is not impressed. I read the Yelp reviews and other sites and we went there yesterday based on these. Disappointed doesn't cover it. The brisket while very tender and juicy had NO flavor on its own. A slight smoke but nothing more. Ribs were tender and again NO flavor. I covered both brisket and ribs in BBQ sauce, which was good, although a little thin, and I got  flavor--from the sauce, not the meat.. The beans and cole slaw were just OK, nothing to write home about. I rated it a 3 because of the service and breakfast and it is better than Memphis BBQ,(I gave them a sympathy 2, bad, bad, bad). Still looking for that BBQ joint that will keep my BBQ craving under control. Famous Dave's still is the place to go, but I had to try something else. Next on the list, Road Kill Café or Rolling Smoke."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden jem. It dont look like much on the outside , but it makes up for it with the food and service. 
Ive lived in Vegas for 20 years, and came here for the first time snd I am happy I did. I came for breakfast, and the food  and portion size was great. The eggs were good, the breakfast potatoes were excellent, and the bacon is home made on site. It was soo good. The biscuts and gravy are the best Ive had in Vegas. 
The service was excellent.
Now that Ive found this place, I definitely will be back.!!!"}
{"text":"The best kept locals secret in NLV! Stopped in for the first time about two weeks ago. Why write the review now? Because I am STILL thinking about that pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese. AMAZING! If you would have asked me before my rendezvous with SNS, I would have told you that me and pulled pork don't mix, apparently because I had never had it done right until these guys. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"KETO FRIENDLY! I went in hopes for a simple keto meal bacon eggs and sausage. It was past breakfast but they where more than happy to accommodate me. Food was good. Waitress informed me of all my keto options. I will be back for ribs and brisket. So happy I found this gem. Very clean environment."}
{"text":"Stopped on my way from Vegas to Zion. Great truck stop. Good BBQ. The portions are huge. I had a pulled pork sandwich, they use a classic NC mustard sauce. The bread was great too. I ordered the mac and cheese, wasn't really a fan but still an awesome place. Great service."}
{"text":"First time, and we all enjoyed and shared our different sandwiches and sides...Yum...love this type of food finds..."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. A little hard to find but worth it. Don't let the outside fool you. Very nice on the inside. Also recently featured on the Food Network."}
{"text":"After having seen this restaurant advertised on a television show on the Food Network, I had wanted to give it a shot. Last weekend, my dad beat me to the breakfast crowd. He thoroughly enjoyed his food and I was jealous. So, in order to get back at him, I made the journey out to this little truck stop.

Not sure on what I wanted to get, I decided on trying to 3 Meat Sampler. You have your choice of ribs, brisket, chicken, rib tips, pulled pork or hot links. You are allowed one choice from the side of menu and in order of corn bread. Complimentary barbecue sauce and ketchup is provided. It was delicious! The best part about ordering too much is that I had leftovers.

As soon as you get out of your car to walk to the door, you can smell the smoker. The interior is small and quaint without letting you forget that grease monkeys come to socialize.

I'm impressed and will not hesitate to make SNS Diner my go-to for smoked heaven in my mouth."}
{"text":"BBQ was great. Brisket was juicy and the hot links were really good. A hidden gem in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Without the other reviews, we would never have found this place. Definitely off the beaten path. But absolutely worth it! Fantastic BBQ and service! Will go again!"}
{"text":"Amazing bbq. You have to get the beans. They are some of the best I've ever had. Also had the peach cobbler today and it's amazing."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly awesome. They had a special for chicken fried steak and it may have been the best we ever had. Quick and friendly service. Clean and modern inside (unlike outside appearances). Terrific diner breakfast."}
{"text":"Fresh salad with just the right amount of meat. Quality food; meats smoked in premises. An unusual setting. All 6 of us had a satisfying lunch. Friendly service. I will go out of my way to return here every time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"I knew what I didn't want to do - stop in the heart of Vegas and blow by fortune on a breakfast buffet.  I wanted something hearty and delicious and relatively fast so I can be back on the road.  SNS Diner is a great hole in the wall alternative if you're traveling on I-15.

Driving up, I couldn't tell whether it was open or not.  It does seem a bit like a truck stop/diner, but have no fear and enter through the doors.  The staff is quite friendly and will take good care of you.  The interior isn't much to look at, but it's clean and comfortable.  The food is where SNS surprisingly shines.

I admit I was a little disappointed that I missed breakfast - switches over to lunch at 10am - as I was 45 minutes too late.  A bit grumpy, I had to put on my big boy pants and \"settle\" for a brisket sandwich and fries.  To my delight, the brisket was delicious.  Not quite a Texas style brisket, but really good regardless.  The side of fries was also amazing - some of the best I've had in a while.

If you're looking for something different and you don't mind getting out of central Vegas, SNS Diner is a surefire pit stop."}
{"text":"WOW. Must stop, even if you're heading south from Vegas. Brisket is juicy, beans are smoky and everything was served hot! Damn, damn, damn...happy tummy. Breakfast looks really good here too. Everything made/smoked in house. Service is spectacular!"}
{"text":"omg! the bbq is awesome. I wouldn't insult the chef by putting bbq sauce on anything. it's smoked to perfection. brisket, ribs, pastrami, bacon, and chicken are all mouth watering. you get that home style feeling here, and the friendly service is excellent. I will definitely drive back across town for this. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Place is very much a dive but the food is excellent. Used to be an old truck stop with showers in the bathrooms. Still operates as a truck wash/ diner. Well worth a stop for lunch or even breakfast. If you have a motor home or trailer they will wash it while you eat.   Staff is very friendly and always have a great attitude."}
{"text":"Tasteful food, and amicable customer service. I wanted to have breakfast but they don't serve it after 10am, so I tried their Home Smoked Pastrami and it was really delicious and filling.
I will definitely come back here to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is sincerely good!  Fresh food deliciously prepared and  served in a pristine environment. Okay, the exterior of the building is a bit scary but just ignore that and go in to enjoy the excellent food, friendly service and impeccably clean restaurant. You have to try the ribs!  They are perfect. It is so nice to find another small, local restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here cause we had an Entertainment coupon for buy one get one free. Got here around 11:30 for an early lunch. 

It is located on an open area. Hardly anyone inside. We were greeted by two nice ladies. We got to sit anywhere we wanted. There were around 2 large screen televisions. 

As we got situated, the nice waitress asked for our drink orders. I got a Diet Coke. I looked at the menu and saw pastrami sandwich. I ordered it without the sauerkraut. I dislike that stuff. For my side, I went with the potato salad which the waitress recommended. The pastrami sandwich was delicious. The meat was thinly sliced and packed in between the rye bread. Every bite was juicy. The potato salad was good as well. You can taste the celery, onion, and seasonings. So good. My hubby enjoyed his bbq brisket. The bbq sauce was good too. If you love bbq meats, this is the place to go eat. 

Service was excellent by the waitress with the reddish colored hair. She made sure we were taken care of. I never got her name but she was friendly. I definitely felt welcomed in this place. We will definitely return to try other menu items especially their specials."}
{"text":"I don't write too many reviews but this place definitely deserves one! :) I'm a sucker for good brisket and this place definitely delivers! One of the best place to get brisket in town. I live on the other side of town but I wouldn't mind driving back here. Food is great and so is the customer service. They're fast and friendly :)"}
{"text":"It was a nice clean place. I don't know about the BBQ but the breakfast was good. The service was great. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"When you think of a hole in the wall place this is probably what you will think of. Food was delicious. Brisket was awesome."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! The absolute best BBQ I have had in Las Vegas! When you look up \"hole in the wall\" in the dictionary SNS BBQ is the first listing, but don't let that keep you away. We drove by twice the first time we went here. There is currently a lot of construction in the area, but it is worth the work to find this place! It is a truck stop/truck wash as well as a diner. They have one of the friendliest staffs in Las Vegas! We are always well taken care of. The Mac & cheese is great! The brisket is to die for! The pastrami burger is one of the best burgers I have ever had! Get it \"loaded\" with all the fixings! The pastrami burger is so good I didn't even think about taking a picture of it before it was in my belly! I haven't had the desserts, but the bread pudding comes highly recommended! If you are in the area stop by! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is a true hidden gem! If this restaurant was on the Las Vegas Strip it would be a wait out the door! Not to mention, the staff and owner are hard working dedicated people! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! My family and I went one day because of so many good yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. We loved every second of the food, atmosphere and the amazing waitstaff."}
{"text":"Just left this amazing place. My goodness it was so delicious! I found this great bbq diner with a valpak coupon. Then I saw the yelp reviews and had to make plans to get a bite. 

I got the 3 meat platter (rib tips and brisket) with corn bread and Mac&Cheese.  Hubbie got the pulled pork sandwich. 
It was all so amazingly good! Everything seasoned to perfection. The slaw, the mustard, the bbq..... simply perfect! The best, for me personally, was the pulled pork and cornbread. I was extremely satisfied with everything and can't wait to return! 
Sidenote: all the employees are fantastic!!!!! Super nice and helpful. I really enjoyed myself"}
{"text":"Never judge a book by it's cover \"Shadow\" 
Kenworth Sales recommend this hidden gem! I had the short rib tacos with the beans and rice. Outstanding great food and customer service. The guy that drove around and ended up at the Denny's. Good job! 
Hope you enjoyed your cardboard meal. 
SNS your BBQ is awesome keep up the great service and cooking the best BBQ in Las Vegas! 

Yelp you can take off Shadows comment obviously we all agree it was very good!"}
{"text":"I have come here several times now and never had a bad lunch.  I have brought co-workers and friends each time and they all love the food.  Great food and you have to try the beans.  My co-worker had the peach cobbler for the first time and loved it."}
{"text":"Omfg got the smoked chicken and I'm a cook. It is the best smoked chicken ever in history. The potato salad was amazing the cornbread has actual corn in it. My son got a pastrami burger omfg.   Go here now"}
{"text":"Found on yelp and went here to get lunch, the outside isn't inviting but the inside is clean and cute. The pulled pork sand which was very good, one of the best I've had. I ordered Mac and cheese as a side and it was bow tie pasta with some kind of Alfredo sauce. If I had actually gotten Mac and cheese I would've given this place 5 stars. Waitress was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"So we really wanted breakfast, and I didn't research properly and we arrived too late for it.  However we stayed and enjoyed a DELICIOUS lunch.  The service was wonderful!    we will definitely be back to try out breakfast.  I would and WILL suggest this spot to everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden but truly a good \"ma n pa\" type shop. The food is good and price is right.  Definitely a jewel to find! Like other reviews dont judge by the outter looks."}
{"text":"We love a good BBQ place while traveling through. Google maps showed this place was close. The area is sketchy and the outside is nothing to look at. My husband didn't want to go in. But inside is surprising and the staff is super friendly. The BBQ was awesome and quick/great service. I had the chicken salad and my husband had the pulled pork sandwich. Very tender and good flavor. The only thing a little off was the flavor of the fries. Definitely go in!"}
{"text":"If you are ever in North Las Vegas and driving down I15 SNS Diner is where to stop. This is a whole in the wall diner that is part of a truck stop that serves delicious food. We had a bacon burger and baby backed ribs with some corn bread and potato salad. The burgers were big and delicious. The ribs had a great dry rub on them and were great all by themselves, but in case you like them wet there was sauce at the table as well. The sides were great too. 

I'm telling you this is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Homemade food at its finest: smoked beans, smoked pulled pork, pastrami, fall off the bone ribs, tasty coleslaw, delicious cobbler, and an order of a sh*t load of fries, as the owner himself put it.  Not only does this place have outstanding food, but character. The owner thoroughly enjoys his job and carries on conversations with his customers with a wonderful sense of humor. Though, it may be deceiving on the outside - don't judge a book by its cover. You'll enjoy your visit, eat good food, and laugh while you're there. A definite stop every time we are near."}
{"text":"Very good food, the Gumbo and Chilli rock. Service is great and very friendly. I will stop here when ever I am in Las Vegas Nevada."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in NV, give it a try you won't regret it and you'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Truck stop BBQ? Yes ma'am. My love of brisket makes me go many places, and this one did not disappoint. Service was just as sweet as if we were back in the south, which was a nice touch.

The three meat plate ($16) is enough for two to share, and comes with a side and cornbread. Had to try the brisket, obviously, and it wasn't a bad pick. Cut a little thinner than I like, but nice and tender with a bit of fat for flavor, just the way it's supposed to be. Lean brisket should be a sin. My guy liked the hot links and our server recommended the rib tips over the ribs. The mac and cheese is made with bowtie pasta, and the sauce has a bit of a kick to it. Cornbread comes in huge pieces, and isn't too sweet.

They have daily specials- the wings were sold out when we came but the pork chili was good. I would come back to try their sandwiches. Save room for dessert- they offer apple, berry, and peach cobbler, available a la mode for $1 more. The peach was tasty but could have used more fruit, was mostly pastry and sauce.

Service was attentive and friendly. Location is a bit hard to find, so I took some photos. Interior is clean and modern, as if it might have been recently renovated. Prices are fair for the portion. Looking forward to coming back to try more."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting after the remodle. Nice change from what it was before i have had two back sugeries and the aluminum chairs were very hard on me. If I go back it will have to be with a small group so i can sit at a booth. 

The staff was very friendly and quick to assist us. Forgot a few things but they were busy and apologetic. All and all I thought the service was great.

The food was ok. It wasent bad and I do want to go back and try some breakfast off the menu. I think everyone should try it and decide for themself."}
{"text":"We went here today for lunch after my sons 21st birthday the night before...needless to say they needed food badly..lol
   The boys ordered the 3 meat combo with beans, potato salad and mac n cheese, I had the pulled pork sandwhich.  The guys also had sweet tea which they say was really really good.  I have to say everything was great, my sanchwhich came with fries and I had them put the sauce on the side, it comes with a south Carolina style mustard sauce..Im from Virginia so we don't do THAT..lol.  im more of North Carolina bbq person.  But that is just personal preference,,the sauce was good, just not my thing with the pulled pork.  The beans were amazing,  so much smoke flavor, the potato salad was very good and the boys thought the mac n cheese was to die for.  All in all it was a great meal and we WILL def. be back..im dying to try the breakfast items,,,,esp. the biscuits and gravy. The only thing missing on the menu is grits and some collard greens:)"}
{"text":"We used SNS to cater a party for 150 people. Everything was delivered on time, plenty of food and delicious!! I would highly recommend SNS for your next function! We also eat at the diner as well. The service and staff are amazing!!!! Everything is delicious but the brisket is my favorite!"}
{"text":"so look.  its a truck stop/tractorwash/kickass bbq

BRISKET. BRISKET. BRISKET.  everyday till its gone.  they have other things and they are good.

but .

BRISKET!  

its a diner and its old and its is little off the road.  give it a try.  you will be pleased.

DONT TELL ANYONE.  it can be our secret."}
{"text":"If you're anywhere near Vegas and you like barbeque, you need to go here NOW. Do NOT be put off by the looks of this place - we almost turned around but I'm SO glad we stopped (thanks to Yelp). It's actually a combination truck wash / restaurant, so it really doesn't look like much and the area is pretty industrial. If they spruced up the exterior and invested in more signage, they'd probably have lines out the door - it's possible they don't want that. (The inside is fine for a diner / barbeque joint.) To think we almost went to Denny's down the street - ugh! 

I ordered the brisket and ribs combo with smoked beans and rice on the side. Everything was perfectly smoked, wonderfully flavorful and juicy. The smoked beans were absolutely out of this world - probably the best barbeque beans I've ever had, no joke. My wife had the cole slaw and said it was also excellent (I didn't try it). Everything - yes EVERYTHING - is made on-site from scratch. We spoke with Celeste the waitress and the cook (sorry didn't get her name) extensively - both were super-friendly and made us feel right at home.

I wish I lived nearby, because I really want to come back and try everything, especially the breakfast and pastrami. Even the bacon is cured/smoked on-site (the pork belly drippings are used in the beans). The BBQ sauce on the table was perfect - just the right balance between spicy and sweet (i.e. not too much of either).

Absolutely worth the drive from The Strip / Downtown, but If you like barbeque, SNS Diner should be on your bucket list, regardless of where you live. It is that good."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast after reading the reviews. Did not disappoint! My wife and I each got omelette and home fries and it was great! Best breakfast I've had in a long time! The staff was super friendly! I'm gonna try and head back to try some bbq before I leave town tomorrow. The outside looks rundown but the inside is nice!"}
{"text":"First walk in right at 11:00 AM, I'm the only customer in the place. You know that feeling you get when NO ONE is in a restaurant you walk into, it's like uh oh, this place must be bad?! As I stand looking around, asking my self if I really want to stay, I am greeted by Celeste, she kindly tells me to have a seat anywhere I like. She honestly made me feel welcome right away, so I decide heck yeah I'm eating here! Celeste and I strike up a conversation about BBQ, and she tells me all about the sausage that is ground in house, and how much pride and time is put into the food at SNS. Then she tells me something that means a lot to a true BBQ aficionado, they serve the smoked meats here WITHOUT SAUCE!!!! Ever wonder why most places serve Q drowning in sauce? its because they are hiding the fact that they can't smoke good Q! Not here, SNS serves some kick ass Q, and they don't cover everything in sauce because they let the flavor of the meat and smoke shine. 

I ordered the three meat combo with one side. 

Brisket
Pulled pork
Ribs
Smoked beans

EPIC MEAL!! Brisket had a wonderful pink smoke ring and was cooked perfectly. Pulled pork was so tender and buttery, like pork heaven. Those ribs are unreal, full of flavor, meaty and oh so tender!! Smoked baked beans are also full of flavor with the perfect balance of sweet and heat.

Hands down one of the best Q restaurants I have experienced. Celeste is a wonderful lady and made me feel so at home, and the food is full of love and pride!
Oh and that empty restaurant I walked into, quickly filled up 5 minutes after I walked in!! 

P.S. That cup of beans was full to the top but I snuck several bites before I took the pic! Muahaha"}
{"text":"Great food! Went there for breakfast the pastrami hash is unbelievable, the bacon smoked with brine and thick cut. Take the time to meet Mike the owner. You'll love this place!"}
{"text":"Everything you want in an American diner. The BBQ rivals anywhere in the south. Get HERE now! Loved the 3 meat sampler, and the peach cobbler is amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch at SNS. Like many reviews said, an out of the way place in Las Vegas In a trucker's stop. The BBQ pork, brisket, BLT, burger and Reuben were all excellent! The staff was so nice as well. Fries and Mac n Cheese were outstanding as well!"}
{"text":"I work in North Las Vegas, and used to frequent the McDonalds at Cheyenne and Losee.  On my way from there to work, after breakfast, I would see this place and decided to try it one morning.  They are extremely friendly...  And, the food is DAMN good.  I was there for breakfast this morning...  A tasty omelet with smoked-on-site pork belly.  It was so good, and I had heard so much about their BBQ, I had to give lunch a try.  Went back for lunch...  A BBQ rib tip sandwich with handmade slaw and spicy Carolina mustard.  Having a brother that competes in BBQ competitions, I'm always critical of other peoples BBQ.  SNS has some EXCELLENT BBQ!  Whether you're interested in breakfast or lunch, this place is definitely worth a try.

Keep up the good work, Mike!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  The first place I've had real good biscuits and gravy! Their homemade bacon is amazing, we will be back for lunch and try their bbq! Celeste and Kim were super nice and very friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in area full of big rigs stopping for gas right off the 15 and with nothing but trucks around, you might miss it. But when I saw the SNS logo I stopped and parked... right next to the smoker! Ah, that wonderful aroma of slow cooked barbecue as we entered the simple, but friendly eatery. So you'd think I be ordering barbecue, right? No, the pastrami on the menu looked inviting, so I asked our server, How's your pastrami? Well. the look of joy that came over her face convinced me, and after ordering, my sandwich arrived quickly. Tender, lightly seasoned meat topped with tasty sauerkraut and melted Swiss nestled between thick slices of marbled bread. It was delicious! 
Give SNS at try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"For once my husband got something right.... Just kidding. There are a few other times in our history. He found this place while waiting for his wheels to get polished next door. That night he came home with a like of smoked pastrami... Yes that's right folks, smoked pastrami. Can we say magic? Needless to say I wanted to see for myself this place of wonder.

So a few days later we went. Somehow we found ourselves in North Vegas... coincidence? Probably not. We swung in for some lunch. We split the 3 meat sampler (brisket, pulled pork, ribs) with Mac and cheese and a side of fries as well. I got a sweet tea. 

Sweet tea... Made me want to find the nearest wrap around porch and a rocking chair. Seriously awesome, seriously not for someone without a sweet tooth. 

Food came. Delicious. The meat was all deliciously smokey, not dry at all. A unique flavor that truly made me eat most of the meat without any sauce. I'm not usually a fan of brisket because of texture, but this stuff was awesome. Pulled pork was perfectly most and smokey. Ribs, they are fickle things and these guys nailed it. Enough cooking to get that really gross fat off, enough bite that it's not mush and tender enough to almost fall of the bone. Flavor is awesome. A little slice with a subtle heat. Delightfully different.  Cornbread is awesome. I will admit I'm an advocate of slathering my cornbread in honey butter, but even without it this stuff is great. 

Update: now they have peach iced tea. I could drink a gallon, really. Tried new stuff. Pastrami burger... Epic. Seriously. Awesome. Pulled pork sandwich also fantastic. The slaw that goes on it is perfect as a condiment. Tried the smoked beans and rice. Ummm that was a little slice of smokey heaven. Clouds parted and angels sang.  That spectacular. 

This is the best BBQ in Vegas. Amazing staff. Everyone is super friendly. Love it. We will continue to drive here from Arizona forever.

Update: I think we have officially tried everything on the lunch menu,  except salads, which are probably great, but I'll be honest, of I'm eating bbq, I don't care about lettuce. Rib tip sammy... Nom nom nom. My husband for some reason thought we weren't doing hassles halvsies on lunch and as soon as I took a bite I knew why. Perfectly caramelized rib tips with delicious slaw and the best Carolina honey mustard to compliment the whole concoction. I pretty much hate mustard in any form, but this, this I will make an exception for. Any time. Any where.  Needless to say, nothing was returned of the sandwich half I stole with the intent of \"a few bites\" 
I got the ham and bacon club. Ham is smoked and unique in it's flavor. Grand idea if you ask me. Bacon is also smoked, so you get tons of flavor, nothing is dry and it all just works beautifully. 
I cannot reiterate the staff here. Everyone is friendly and you can tell Mike takes pride in what he does. If it's any indication we have eaten here about  5 times I the last month and it is literally on the furthest point of town from where we do anything."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hole in the wall, but they serve tasty food. My husband and I came here for breakfast. I had a waffle, eggs, and sliced bacon while my husband had a build your own omelet. Both dishes were amazing!  Plus Celeste, the waitress, is so nice and attentive. You can tell she really likes her job. Mike, the owner/cook is also nice. He even came out to talk to me and my husband after our meal. I'll be coming back to try their lunch!"}
{"text":"We just ate lunch at SNS Diner and what a great barbeque place.  We had brisket, hot links, pulled pork and tips. They all were fabulous.  The meat was moist tender and flavorful.  The mac & cheese side was very good.  We loved the fresh cut fries.  They were addictive.  We could not stop eating them.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We will be going back soon and often. SNS hit the experience out of the park."}
{"text":"On our way up to base and wanted to get a good burger so we took a chance on this because of the reviews.  We did not go wrong. Had a couple of burgers and peach cobbler for dessert.  Very very good! Fresh burgers and fries and the cobbler was the Bomb!  We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Be sure not to drive by. Everyone was super friendly.  Thanks American Diner Revival for helping me find this place! !!"}
{"text":"Found this jewel when in Vegas. A must if you like great BBQ!!! Peach Cobbler with Vanilla Ice cream to die for!! Employees very friendly and made us feel at home!!!"}
{"text":"Staff- really nice women helped us out we came around 8am on a weekday and she seemed to be the only one that was taking the orders. She was super sweet
Food- I will definitely be coming back for an omlet it was delicious will have to come back for their lunch."}
{"text":"We just moved to town. This place is a BBQ hole in the wall. When they care more about the food than the esthetics of the diner, you know it's good. It reminds me of the BBQ place Francis loves to eat in House of Cards. Cobler is great too. Iced tea is not watered down like some places."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, the cobbler is to die for. Very filling. I will try and get there before 10am next time for breakfast."}
{"text":"Amazing! SNS BBQ, is a major player in fantastic food. This is a small place. Used to be a truck stop. When we pulled up I wasn't so sure. But when I came thru the door that great smoke smell let me know that this was something special. I had baby back ribs. Full rack is about 12 bones. Good meatyness. Great rub. Really good homemade sauce. My friend had thee pulled chicken sandwich. Came with topnotch corn bread, slaw and fries. She said the homemade Carolina mustard was great. Place was clean, people super friendly. I wish this place was in my town and I could give more stars! Winner!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you! It looks almost like an abondoned diner at a truck stop... but once you go in it's great! Clean and modern! Food portions are big and the food is great! The Denver omelet is so filled it's almost like a pie! Super freindly staff make you feel right at home. A little off the beaten path from the Vegas strip but worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Please do not eat here. I cannot believe this place has so many good reviews. We asked for lean brisket and got fatty brisket. When we told the waitress that the brisket was fatty, she told us that it was all pre-portioned and that she thought all brisket was the same.
The mac (bow ties) and cheese was grainy and tasted bad.
The pulled pork sandwich was ok, not good or bad, very average.
I would suggest that you go to Rollin' Smoke or Billie's BBQ if you are in Las Vegas looking for good BBQ. Both understand BBQ better than the people at SNS. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Mom and pop shop. Hole in the wall. Locally owned. Take your pick. Actually all three apply. Before my initial thoughts, here's the back story.

After speaking with the owner Mike and the nice server Celeste, I found out that this place is an actual truck stop/wash. They decided to start serving breakfast and lunch because of all the numerous truckers coming in complaining about eating fast food at the McDonald's on the corner.

So SNS Diner (SNS stands for Southern Nevada Services) was born. They have been open for about a year. They are located off of Colton but the main cross street is Losee Road. As soon as you turn on to Colton, the place is on your right. Just look for the barbeque signs. At first look you might think that this place could be where they would film a CSI episode. But after coming out of your car, the smell of wood smoke (hickory maybe? I should of asked) should tell you that there is some good smoking going on and im not talking about weed.

Now for the main reasons why you should go here: The good food and great service.

For breakfast I have had the Biscuits and Gravy ($6.99), Pastrami Hash ($8.99), Eggs Benedict ($8.99), and 2 Eggs over easy with Bacon and Potatoes (6.99).

The Biscuits and Gravy came highly recommended so that was the first item my wife was looking forward to. The gravy itself has breakfast sausage mixed in it and had a little bit of a kick to it. After taking one bite you will know that the biscuits were made fresh from scratch.

The Pastrami Hash was just a tad bit salty but with a bit of ketchup or barbeque sauce it rounds out the flavor. I can only assume the bit of saltiness is from the chopped up bits of pastrami. With that it is comprised of green peppers, onions, scrambled eggs, and black pepper. It is topped off with 2 fried eggs cooked to your liking.

The Eggs Benedict were decent. They were definitely better than the ones I had a couple weeks ago at another breakfast joint.

The 2 eggs and bacon with home fries were just average.

For lunch, (this is where they will definitely keep me coming back) I have had the 3 Meat Combo ($13.99) and the Rib Tip Sandwich ($8.50).

The 3 Meat Combo you have your choice of ribs, chicken, brisket, or pulled pork, all which have been smoked for whatever designated time they did it for. I went with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. The St Louis Ribs have this rub on it that makes it very flavorful. It's not fall off the bone tender but tender enough for you to eat it off the bone with ease. The Brisket was juicy and tender as well. The Pulled Pork was good too. The common theme for all these meats is that they all have the great smoke flavoring and are not dry at all as evidenced by the juices at the bottom of your foil lining of your basket.

The Rib Tip Sandwich originally I thought it said Tri Tip so when I got my sandwich I was surprised to see that the chopped bits of meat were actually rib tips. Nevertheless it was good. So good in fact that I didnt even need the bread just to eat the meat! Dont get me wrong, the bread was good too! It was all buttered up and grilled to a slight crispiness on the inner portion. the rib tips also had a mixture of some kind of rub that has a kick to it. The plate comes with Carolina Mustard and a Vinaigrette Slaw that is usually in the sandwich but they will ask you if you want it on the side instead of inside the sandwich. Both plates come with your choice of one side which consists of Mac n Cheese, Smoked Beans, Smoked Beans and Rice, Green Salad, Vinaigrette Slaw, or Potato Salad. All are good choices.

Service is excellent! Celeste constantly walks around making sure you are ok. Sometimes Mike the owner will stop by and confirm that everything was ok.

Some random info: Business hours are Monday thru friday 7 am to 4 pm and Saturday 7 am to 2 pm. Closed Sundays. Breakfast hours are until 10 am. You can only order breakfast. After 10 lunch items only. They take cards.

In closing, I say give this place a chance. Even though it is kind of in a hidden spot, you will definitely remember where they are once you eat here! I know the hours dont extend into the dinner slot but you gotta remember, this place was originally for truckers making their way through town during the day. Im sure once they start getting busier the owner will have to do something about it, which was pretty much my last comment right before I left. Also I keep wanting to try their berry cobbler which other Yelpers have mentioned but I always find myself too full to order it!

{"text":"Came at 1030a for breakfast -
But they were already switched to lunch menu. 
Got coffee and lunch . 
 Clean establishment that looks like a hole in the wall. 
Was a truck stop, still is a truck wash
They even take orders for meat by the pound
They smoke all their own meat, even bacon ! 
Homemade mac and cheese is advertised but it's really bow ties topped in a bland cheese sauce with breadcrumbs thrown in it. Not baked. Not even broiled . Do not be deceived . We ate one spoonful and left the rest for trash - literally some of the worst I've ever had in life. Kraft box Mac & cheese is better .

French fries were hand cut, deep fried and seasoned to perfection. Excellent !! 
Brisket was smoked well. Needed more salt but was good overall,
Best we've had in Las Vegas over the past week. 
Smoked chicken was seasoned with same stuff as other bbq items , needed salt and garlic, Etc . I advise agAinst.


Mac & cheese - 1 out of 5 DISGUSTING 
Ribs -3 out of 5
French fries 4 out of 5
Brisket 4 out of 5
Smoked chicken - 2 out of 5
SERVICE 5out of 5-- Celeste !! 
Overall 3.5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Been working near here for 11 years, and never knew this little gem was here. Driven by a thousand times but never the other side of the Truck wash. Food looks great a nice pictures posted so we are giving it a chance, hopefully we won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this little bbq place. Great pork sandwich. Highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"If I had only one word to describe this place...WOW!!! This is definitely a hidden gem. The food is fantastic and service is top-notch."}
{"text":"Mike the owner is as upfront and honest as you get. On top of that the food is FIRE! Had the BBQ beef ribs, chicken, and beans. Everything was on point. New shop and mike sincerely asked how he could do better, that's how your supposed to do it! Kudos to you mike I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"We stopped in when they opened first thing in the morning and the girl was so sweet, still opening the blinds, she poured us coffee while she got ready for us
Do yourself a favor and get the spinach mushroom omlet it will NOT disappoint EVERYTHING is fresh not frozen or canned AMAZING and the bacon OMG the bacon I think it's smoked I KNOW it's delicious
Everyone is so nice and food....AMAZING"}
{"text":"Delicious find! Staff super friendly and bbq is fab!! Home made goodness, definitely worth stopping in if you're in the neighborhood. Try the cornbread!!"}
{"text":"We've been to the SNS a few times now, and every time, I leave happily full and raving about how good it was. I've had the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni, pastrami sandwich with potato salad, and biscuits and gravy, and all of that was fantastic. The potato salad was not my favorite I've ever had, but was good. The macaroni may well have been my favorite I've ever had, and that's saying a lot because macaroni is itself one of my favorite foods. The pulled pork sandwich with slaw on it is nothing short of amazing. My husband has had the brisket sandwich with beans, the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni, and the pancakes with bacon. He's been kind enough to let me sample his items, and none have disappointed. The bacon was especially tasty. The service is always friendly, and the prices are great. All in all, I give this five stars with no hesitation. I'd give it six if I could."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is wonderful...not to mention the best service!! They are very clean, and down to earth! stop in for a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Brisket was awesome,  I'd definitely come back if I was in the area. Staff and customers were wicked nice, I got it to go cuz it's a Truck Stop, but it's comfortable and I should just ate right there at the counter- I might have gotten a second sandwich if I had!"}
{"text":"Yes, the biscuits and gravy are very good. This place  is a dining experience, a little off the beaten path. To look at the out side of the building, you would most likely keep driving, but the food and the real wait staff are refreshing. The baby back ribs were tender and falling off the bone and the brisket had a smokey flavor that I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for the power of yelp.   If it wasn't for yelp, we would probably ended up eating corporate food at some chain restaurant.

SNS Diner is located literally in the middle of nowhere.  On the outside the place doesn't look like much, but on the inside it is clean and nicely renovated.

The food was great, I loved my krout pastrami sandwich.   My son loved his pulled pork sandwich.   We will be back here during our stay in Vegas."}
{"text":"I work in the same area and was really getting tired of the food around here and along came SNS! They serve breakfast (awesome eggs Benedict) and lunch. Everything is fresh and cooked/smoked daily from the bacon to the pastrami. Since they are brand new, sometimes they run out of a few items, but I'd rather that, then get some old freezer burned stuff they try to pass of as \"fresh\" like some places do.Their bbq pork sandwich is out of this world good, I get mine with a side of their macaroni and cheese (yum!) and  all of my co-workers unanimously name the brisket as their go-to item.  If you are in the mood for really good bbq then seriously, give them a try!"}
{"text":"Place was very good find. Do not be put off by the exterior. Mesquite smoked meats.the waitress was extremely friendly and informative."}
{"text":"You have got to try their bacon! Michael brines and smokes it himself, and it is soooooo delicious! And their homemade mac & cheese is terrific also! Everything is homemade (\"except the fries,\" Michael says) and it's all good! We taken brisket and ribs by the pound to family gatherings, and it's always a big hit!"}
{"text":"Simply the best BBQ in Vegas. I don't even like baked beans and I get them every time I am there. Mac and cheese is killer and every smoked meat is fantastic. The personal touch in every dish make it a go to place. Keep it up Mike"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California so I went on yelp and found this place, MAN I'm glad I did!! The food and especially the service was excellent. I ordered the 3 meat sampler ooh wee so good! I will be coming back here when I visit Vegas"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Thats the best brisket I have ever had!  Moist and tender.  Ribs were great as well.  All home made, fresh ingredients.  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Foodtastic! Everything here is a wild party for your mouth. How do I describe this place? You drive into a truck car wash and pull up to the small building where the truckers pay. It might even be a truck gas station. The parking lot is greasy but empty of cars. Trucks scattered around the property. Be brave and don't let the outer shell scare you from this excellent mouth explosion of greatness. 
     We had a group of 3adults, 1child and twin 2 year old. Kind of a scary for any restaurant to see entering their establishment. They had shined new chairs(I've been here before), nice clean surrounding and a bathroom/shower if the bbq sauce gets all over you,hehe. Water was served quickly with small cups for the toddlers. We ordered St.Louis ribs, a large order to share. A hamburger, French fries and Mac and cheese to satisfy youngsters. While we waited for our order I tasted the bbq sauce in the bottle on the table, hmm, good! Then I was trying it again and again, hmm, super good. Tangy. I would have bought a bottle but we are flying home(bottle over 3oz) not sure I could convince TSA this is medicinal. 
     Ok, I have had enough Mac and cheese to last me a life time raising 3 kids. I thought,'oh I'll take a taste.' My goodness! This was the best I've ever had. The sauce had a becumel flavor but still cheesy. Bits of bacon sprinkled over added just the right bit of smoke and salt. The cornbread was fantastic. I did not share my piece. Everyone raves about the hamburger, again shared, but I was too busy with the to dye for ribs. 
    Needless to say, this is my first stop on my next trip to see grandchildren."}
{"text":"Saw this place on yelp after we found our original destination closed. Never would have discovered it otherwise. This unassuming place is close to an I-15 exit/entrance surrounded by gas stations and next to a truck wash, Great smoked bacon burger, baby back ribs, saint louis ribs, and peach cobbler!"}
{"text":"The location is not very pretty, but the food and service is excellent.  I ordered a lean brisket sandwich and fries.  The brisket was hands down the best I've had outside of Texas.  It had a great smoke flavor and a nice firm texture, served on a perfectly toasted kaiser roll.  The fries were hand cut and not greasy at all.  You can tell they take great pride in their food.  Looking forward to trying the ham-the chef was describing the prep and it sounded delicious."}
{"text":"Don't let the sketchy outside fool you! This place is so amazing! The service is fast, and the staff is very nice!"}
{"text":"Best ever BBQ in town, my all time favorite place only you need a day off to go because they are only open for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I really love finding out-of-the-way places like this that don't look like much from the outside. This place is a small, older building attached to a truck wash in an industrial area. You can see why you might not guess to go there...

However, this place is SO good! The service is excellent and the food is just as good. The portions are generous too. Be warned though: the meat IS definitely smoked and if you don't like that style of cooking, then you won't like this place. 

Overall, this place is an awesome local place to visit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is amazing. Everyone was super friendly and made you feel welcome. The outside isn't the most inviting but once you come inside - you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Wonderful BBQ find. Don't be afraid of the exterior and setting. They are making great grub in there. Friendly people too"}
{"text":"Found out about this place from a friend of mine and it was absolutely as advertised.  In other words? Amazing!  I had the pulled pork sandwich with slaw on top (of course!) and a side of mac and cheese.   It was abso-freaking-lutely fantastic!!  I lived in North Carolina for years and let me tell you, this took me back to the delicious barbecue of my younger years.  Just amazing.  Great mac and cheese too.  My wife had a burger with everything on it and had a special request - an egg on the burger and they happily accommodated the request. Her burger - egg and all - was just perfect.  The fries were fantastic as well.  Service was amazing - our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful.  She was just great.  Overall, I can't recommend this place enough -  it is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is a no frill looking diner in the outside attached to a semi truck wash but is most definitely worth the stop. When you walk inside you are instantly transported into a very clean, colorful neat looking diner with wonderful friendly servers! The food is all made from scratch on site. They start their BBQ first thing in the morning with their special smokers. The meat is juicy, tender and flavorful. Great with or without BBQ sauce. Their BBQ is very yummy as well. Most def worth the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've found an oasis of gastronomic glory in North Las Vegas!

Don't let the exterior of this truck wash fool you, within the walls of SNS Diner is some top notch Vegas BBQ. I had the two meat plate (ribs and pulled pork) both were excellent. But the stunner is the naked beans; just the correct balance of heat and smoke. The move is to put all of your pulled pork into the styrofoam container the golds the beans, fold in, and enjoy.  Be sure to save room for cobbler, the mixed berry al a mode was fantastic."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and wanted to find a great breakfast spot. It was near our hotel and had good reviews so decided to try it out. It's doesn't look very inviting from the outside but the food is delicious! Must try their peach cobbler!"}
{"text":"Freshly carved and juicy meats presented on fresh buttery buns, thick sliced seasoned fries and refreshing house made sweet tea. SNS Diner is the place to eat if you're searching for an authentic BBQ experience in a chill diner setting. Do not let the outside fool you! It's in the middle of an industrial road in NLV but it's the inside that counts. Friendly waitresses and quick service makes this hole in the wall one of the best places in the city. Prices are fair for the amount of food on your plate. Dessert is delicious but you might be too full so take it to go. Take the trip down to SNS Diner!"}
{"text":"Great place in N Las Vegas. Went for breakfast this morning. I had eggs, potatoes and bacon. The bacon was amazing!!! The cook/ owner told us that he smokes his own meat and you can tell. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome, simple BBQ but the taste is 5 stars all the way, very clean inside, kitchen appears to be spotless with shinny stainless steel as far as you can see.  Price is less than the major BBQ places near by and taste blows them away."}
{"text":"The outside does not look inviting at all, but if your brave enough to go inside the food is amazing. I have had biscuits and gravy at many places and not a single place compared to my grandmas untill this place. Super good food! Dishes looked a little grubby but good food."}
{"text":"Simple place with a truck stop feel. Delicious BBQ chicken, pork, and beef. Great service and amazing food."}
{"text":"My second time visiting with my boyfriend and it was even better than I remember! The place has been renovated and looks really nice! The service is always great, I love the servers. I never have to wait for them to come by, they seem to always know when I need a refill or something on the side. and the chef is always friendly and likes to speak with the customers about the food. I feel like family when we stop by, even though we've only been twice.

I ordered the 3-meat sampler (ribs, pulled pork, rib tips) and my boyfriend ordered the pork tacos and brisket meal. it was all delicious!! my favorite is the rib tips while my bf loves the brisket. the cornbread is really good, too. and their Georgia preach sweet tea, omg! we both wanted to take some home. we ended with s peach cobbler and berry cobbler a la mode: again, SO DELICIOUS.

anytime we want BBQ, this is the go-to spot. never again will I settle for Famous Dave's or anything of the like. :)"}
{"text":"Bar none the best BBQ in the west and the staff was the nicest around. 

Today we visited them and had two of the three meat platters ending up with Ribs Chicken Pulled Pork and Brisket for sides we had Mac & Cheese and Potato Salad. 

All of the meats were incredible nothing was wrong with any of them. 

The Mac & Cheese was better than some five star restaurants have produced. 

The potato salad was amazingly on point!

The Berry Cobbler was outrageously good. 

Lastly the prices were very reasonable with all that food and two drinks was 30.27. 

Rollin Smoke and Road Kill Grill while they have been on TV and get the tourist stand 0 chance against the quality of food here."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch today. It was our 1st time here. My husband was really hesitant when we pulled up and kept asking \"Really?\" As the outside looks very run down and nothing like an eating place in no way shape or form! I just jumped out of the car with my 12 year old in tow and said \"Yes, let's go. It has great reviews on Yelp\". As soon as we walked in, we saw the clean cool liking interior and were greeted warmly by the servers, I knew it would be all good. They have a great menu and even a \"Secret Menu\", which we forgot to ask about. Miky our server from our home state of Hawaii was super friendly and excellent"}
{"text":"Their BBQ sauce is on point, all of their meats are tender and delicious! I want to try everything at SNS! Next up-Smoked Meatloaf Sandwich! :D"}
{"text":"We have dined here twice now and the food is great - homestyle food with friendly service. The pulled pork sandwich was the stand out for me, with the coleslaw and Carolina mustard, it is really hard to beat. The burger was also good, as was the meat plate. When available, don't miss the corn bread, which was likely some of the best I have ever had! The owner was exceptionally friendly and outgoing (and the fries were definitely better when he was there)! Will definitely be going back... several times!"}
{"text":"This place has the best smoked barbecue in all of Las Vegas. Don't let the outside of the building fool you. It is located at a semi truck car wash but once you walk inside it is just amazing and the service is beyond belief. You must try their cornbread and their brisket and macaroni and cheese. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! The food is always on point. The staff is so great! Arlena and Celeste make it feel like home. They are the sweetest women! We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"My colleague and I took an early flight to Las Vegas for work and were STARVING by the time we arrived. We were providing technical assistance in a remote area of Las Vegas, so the dining options were limited. We quickly reviewed Yelp and found SNS Diner. The reviews were amazing so we followed the Yelpers advice!

Upon arriving, it looks a little run down...not going to lie...very run down and a little scary. We almost decided not to go, but the reviews were so incredible, so we went for it and I am sure glad we did. When we walked in the diner was clean and the staff were super friendly. We were seated promptly and the food was served quickly. 

We ordered a omelet to share and I was very happy about this decision. IT WAS HUGE! It also came with a side of home cooked potatoes with onions. There was so much food we both still had a perfect serving. To top it all off, it was so yummy. It tasted like a home cooked meal with a burst of flavor. The cook even came out to see if we enjoyed the meal! 

This is a classic example that looks can be deceiving, seriously don't judge a book by its cover. I certainly learned my lesson!"}
{"text":"If you've not eaten here already, then you are missing out! Great food. Great service. Great find on this business trip. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yelp took me to this place. It didn't look open. Boy am I glad we got out of the car to check. The Denver omelette was made with ham smoked right there at SNS in their custom made smoker and it showed. Unbelievable breakfast guys. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll be back for some full on BBQ. Delicious food and extremely friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of the things I miss about leaving Texas is the lack of good BBQ in Nevada, but the lunch we had at SNS was a treat for the taste buds. When you can eat brisket without sauce, you know it's good. Didn't even need a knife! My husband enjoyed the pulled pork and the ribs, and the potato salad was great too. The friends with us had ribs (her) and wings (him) along with the baked beans - proclaimed them delicious. But the cornbread...that was worth the entire experience....some of the best cornbread I've ever tasted, so good that we all ordered some to go. From the outside it doesn't look impressive but appearances are deceiving. The service was good, considering it was the height of the lunch rush, and we could tell they were doing their best to get to everyone ASAP."}
{"text":"AMAZING! From the tender brisket, delicious mac n cheese and out-of- this-world corn bread to the outstanding service, this place was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I totally suggest the ribs and the cornbread. The ribs are the best ribs that I have ever tasted in my whole life. The bathrooms were kind of gross. One of the bathrooms didn't even lock."}
{"text":"Perfect BBQ lunch. I ordered the rib tip sandwich with smoked beans. The waitresses were nice and service was great. 

-beans: exploding smoky flavor
-mustard: classic taste with a light rosemary flavor 
-bun: hearty yet soft. Perfect and puffy. 
-rib tip: succulent and Smokey 
-coleslaw: red and white cabbage, carrrot, red pepper. Light and flavorful but not subtracting from other flavors provided perfect crunchiness to contrast soft bun. 

Excellent sandwich craftsmanship with no BS. I really appreciated the quality of the ingredients and the ratios of texture and flavor!"}
{"text":"My wife and I like to check out little hole in the wall places when we travel.  Though we enjoyed our \"expensive\" restaurants on the strip, on our way out of Vegas we found this little dive and stopped in for lunch.  First, like every other review you read before mine, this place looks like a dump.  It actually looks like it was an old auto parts store.  So we walked in and were greeted right away, handed 2 menus and told to have a seat anywhere we liked.  We sat at a booth in the back and were offered a complementary pate of cornbread, which wasn't bad at all.  Both my wife and I ordered the 3 meat combo and had the ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  We also both ordered a basket of fries.  As a BBQ lover, and someone who grills very well, I was content with my portions and the flavor.  The meat was all smoked, had a decent taste and wasn't dry.  The BBQ sauce was decent as well.  The fries, though good...weren't the best.  Still good though.  

While we sat and ate, the place filled up with what appeared to be a mix of truckers and workers in the area.  So my opinion,   If you want to get away from the hustle of Vegas, hit up a not so fancy dive, have decent food at a reasonable price...along with excellent service.  Give this place a try.  Just dont expect much in regards to the looks of this place.  If there are no cars when you get here, it may look like an abandoned old building in a old warn out parking lot."}
{"text":"Don't let the truck wash exterior of SNS make you drive bye-park-go in and get some mighty fine BBQ!"}
{"text":"The BBQ here has a great flavor.  I've eaten here twice so far and in between they were remodeled on a reality TV show.  The ribs are very good, the pulled pork is great, the brisket is some of the best I've had, the rib tips are also excellent.  The chicken was good, but I'll probably just get the pork and beef next time.  It was not bad.  I just liked the other meats better.

I've only tried two sides and both were excellent.  The beans and rice is very smoky - I loved them. The Mac N Cheese is bowties with a crumbled topping.  Not your usual pasta, but I actually preferred it over the more traditional elbows.  I once heard elbow macaroni called the most pedestrian of pastas.  Kids might not like it, but this is not really a kids restaurant if you ask me.  The cobbler was warm and tasty.

The new decorating is nice.  There is now a separation between the trucker lounge and the dining area.  Did I mention that this diner is connected to a truck wash?  Which OK by me.  Trucks need washing and truck drivers need food so I'm good with it.  Parking is ample.  Service is really friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Had the pastrami hash. It was enough for two. The building looks a bit rough on the outside but the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Stopped for the best diesel price in town, and left with a to go box of ridiculously good BBQ!  There was no resisting after I walked past the smoky smell.  Super tender brisket,  delicious sauce!!"}
{"text":"I had to make a yelp account just because of the terrible food. There is no way this place has the rating it does. It's 100% inflated. I got boiled ribs with spices thrown on them. Unsweetened tea that tastes like well water with ice, and even after adding cane sugar made it 100x worse. The only redeeming thing was the salad I had, and even that is pushing it. I'm debating at this moment to make myself vomit due to how terrible it was. Someone else was paying, but I suffered to show appreciation for the meal. I understand it's a truck diner, but god damn. I've been too hole in the walls, but never a back alley shit hole. 

0/0 would not feed to my dog."}
{"text":"If you hadn't eaten at this place you haven't gone to Vegas! Don't waste your time with the overpriced restaurants on this trip come straight here and you have to have one meal here on every trip to Las Vegas! The brisket was not fatty but amazingly tender the chicken was moist and juicy, the cobbler was to die for! 

Don't waste your time with over priced buffets on the Strip come here!"}
{"text":"This place is a truck wash and bbq diner.  I got the bbq chicken and brisket with beans.  My dad got the bbq brisket with ribs.  Everything was great but the brisket  way fabulous.   Tender, full of flavor, juicy with just the perfect amount of fat.  The beans were awesome,  I ate every last one.   The staff was very friendly.   If the breakfast is as good as the lunch they will know me by my first and last  name.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service with a great meal. Customer service was outstanding, I was in, ate a great sandwich and out the door within 30 minutes. Prices we're fair and as mentioned the pulled pork sandwich was great.  I will stop there again next time I'm in the area and I would recommend SNS Diner to anyone!"}
{"text":"A sudden change in personal circumstances led me to follow reviews to a simply wonderful breakfast ordering a la carte off the menu. Not much of an appetite so this method worked well for me. Home cooking and better than home service. I was craving those breakfast potatoes mostly. Oh so good. Scrambled eggs with cheese. Drink. $7 with tax plus tip. Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Do you ever get the urge to bust out your John Deere baseball cap and head down to the truck stop? If so, then Nortowns SNS is the place for you. Just put the hammer down and boogie your Mack to the back door. Can somebody tell me how a building can have two back doors? When you drop out of the rig onto the parking lot  the the first thing you smell isn't diesel, its smoked hickory. They serve a meaty smokey BBQ sandwich. They use real smokers for their meat, not that puke juice that other so called BBQ coops use. Cole slaw is good as well. Get some extra napkins lunch is going to be messy. Service was served with a genuine  smile. A rarity these days. You can get your CB repaired in the motorhome out front while you eat. After you finish the grinds, grab a towel and flip flops so you can take a shower in the drivers lounge out back."}
{"text":"Do you really want to eat here? I understand if you do as we live close by and the popularity of this fine establishment may make it hard for us local folks to pop in and out on a whim Oh well  

I admit we dont come here often enough because theres so many choices in town. I'm happy SNS is bringing good food to North Las Vegas because it can be a food desert. We truly appreciate it. I am torn on what I like best from SNS, breakfast or lunch so we try to go around 10 to hopefully get to choose from both. Hubs LOVES the biscuits and gravy. I think BBQ is the bees knees, especially theirs. Good food. Good people"}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here. It's been three weeks since I found this place and they're closed on Sundays. 

We were told we could sit wherever we wanted, so we sat at the bar. There is a TV behind the counter to watch. Waitress took our drink order quickly and was helpful with my indecision. Boyfriend ordered biscuits and gravy, she said she had just taken the biscuits out of the oven... I ordered the French Toast. 

So, turns out... Our waitress was actually the cook, Kim, and the waitress, Celeste, was busy having to deal with some nonsense for another customer. 

Okay, back to the review. I could hear Kim in the back cooking our food. Sounded like some shit was going down back there. Then suddenly... Food came out while I was typing this... I needed to stop. I was too excited to eat, I forgot to take pictures. Sorry... But there's plenty of pictures, I figured you readers would understand. 

I don't need butter on my french toast. Just a bit of syrup, maple. French Toast tasted amazing. Revolutionary. Her sausage was REAL! Made fresh. Gravy made from scratch. Biscuits from scratch. My FT didn't taste irony like it does from Dennys or IHOP. SNS knows how to do breakfast. 

We will be returning soon, probably for lunch next time. And I'm going tell anyone and everyone I can about this place."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good breakfast place and through yelp, came across SNS BBQ.  It's located at a truck wash off Losee and Colton,  in North Vegas.   This was a nice surprise. The diner itself was pretty basic, but the staff was very friendly, service was pretty quick, and the food was excellent.  I had the sausage gravy and eggs Benedict.....or something like that.  Biscuits, topped with bacon and poached eggs, all smothered in gravy,  with potatoes mixed with peppers and onions.  Delicious.   I couldn't eat it all in one sitting so took the rest to go.   Lunch starts at 1000.  I was able to peek into the smoker and everything looked fantastic.  SNS BBQ, Losee and Colton."}
{"text":"Let's face it.  Dumpy places sometimes make great food.  The place is an old beat up dinner that looks like it a good place for the next Walking Dead episode.  However, the breakfast was wonderful.  The pancake was moist and delicious. Eggs were cooked to perfection.  My friend ordered the pastrami hash and he raved about.  We will go back.  Hopefully before the apocalypse."}
{"text":"Frist off worst customer service ever I asked if I can add extra meat to my combo the server said \"No we can't do that \" with an attitude. Not once did the server come check on us or offer a refill on our drinks. I over heard the two servers talking about how the other customers did not give a tip  The food was not good at all no flavor real bland I had to drown the meat in water down BBQ sauce. You are better off going to Rollin smokes barbecue"}
{"text":"Went here based on Yelp reviews for breakfast. Was a little nervous based on the outside. Once inside it was a nice atmosphere with the best waitress ever. Food was amazing. Really want to come back for a BBQ lunch."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad.  The coffee was not my cup of tea. It just felt like the coffee was burnt. But the portion size was great!"}
{"text":"Great cafe. Had lunch. Cheese burger and fries. Mac and cheese, brisket sandwich, tacos, beans. Fries are homemade, excellent.  Beans very good, wife said good but a little sweet. Brisket had great flavor. Wife said tacos were excellent.  Homemade peach cobbler was good. Employees were very friendly.  Cooks came out to talk as well. Clean bright atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has good service, good prices, and wow the Bisket is great! We stop by while on our road trip. it does not look pretty but it will fuel you with good food."}
{"text":"This place has amazing breakfast!  We've had the omelettes, French toast, waffle, and biscuits and gravy. They have all been amazing. Everything is cooked when you order so it's fresh and delicious. We found it by accident when we first moved here and are so glad we did. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's clean and the food is amazing. Celeste is nice and great at her job. All around good experience every time we go!"}
{"text":"Attentive service.  Unbelievably delicious smoked meats.  Even the fries were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I arrived at this location on the east side of the building and almost drove away thinking it was closed, either for the morning or forever.  Luckily I decided to investigate further.  If you are headed out of Vegas toward SLC or Hwy 93 this is must stop for breakfast or lunch.  This is the first review I have written for Yelp (although I've been using it for years) but I felt compelled to share this north Vegas gem."}
{"text":"Always great food.  i've had lunch at SNS on many occasions with friends, customers and co-workers.  So far, no disappointments.

The bacon cheeseburger is outstanding with great smoked bacon, cooked just right (not crunchy, not raw...).  A full order of baby back ribs is huge and exceptionally meaty.  I like that they cook with only rub, then allow the diner to add sauce as they see fit.  I also like that the house bbq sauce is not thick, but the thinner, juice type.

My favorite sides are the mac n cheese and the beans/rice."}
{"text":"The people are always friendly and the food is so awesome! I usually order the pulled pork sandwhich with rice beans side. Their cornbread is free and is to die for! The fries are amazing too and theres good amount of portioning for the price of the meal.. 

The two waitresses who are always there are the sweetest ever.. i will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Eh ... Im really dissapoint they dont serve breakfast all day eh ... I eint know why they dont pretty much all diners have breakfast all day ... :( pretty lame :/ 
5stars when u make breakfast all day"}
{"text":"Kids loved it. My son wanted french toast, but we came too late. I liked my pulled chicken and their burger they shared was really good, even for my picky little girl. The kids even grabbed some ice cream after their meal. This place is perfect for a quick stop and those who don't mind a \"truck stop\" feel. Fast and kind customer service!"}
{"text":"Still great. Give this place a try!
The owner makes everything fresh and cares about the food quality. 
Best BBQ in town!"}
{"text":"This place has legit smoked meats. I ordered the pastrami burger with swiss cheese and it was perfect. Seasoned well and pastrami was awesome. My cousin ordered the rib tip sandwich which had great flavor with delicious sauce. My aunt got the brisket Philly which was moist, tender, and flavorful. 

The smoked beans and rice was so smoky and tasty. Mac and cheese is done with bowties and the cheese was smooth and creamy. The fries are handcut it appeared and seasoned to perfection. I didn't try the apple cobbler but my aunt and cousin said it was great. The service was on point and we got our food quick. If you love meat and smokey goodness definitely come eat here. The chef Sabrina is amazing!"}
{"text":"Really amazing BBQ!!  Everything I've had here is just fantastic.  Try the pulled pork, hot links, ribs, and the cobbler is to die for!!  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Brisket tacos and burgers! I  love this place! Food is amazing and the service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a hole in the wall diner with some pretty damn good BBQ this is your spot! I work in that area and frequent this little gem often. I give it 5 stars for their dino bone special and for the price of their food!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast.  Doesn't look like much from the outside and really the inside either. The food however was served hot and delicious.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Real nice people serving you. The BBQ was good. Brisket was nice, smoked beans are the best I've ever had. Ribs were very nice without sauce. Great place........ I'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me just say this is the best biscuits & gravy in town! I ordered the pastrami hash with a side of B&G and let me tell you that's the way to go. The best of both worlds. I couldn't finish it but the pastrami & hash was tasty. The pastrami is smokey and the homemade hash was awesome. A most stop for travels or any local when cruising through N. Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Being from the south I LOVE real homemade sausage biscuits and gravy not the white country style gravy THAT'S not sausage gravy people and a biscuit should be soft and fluffy not placed on a grilled to heat up causing it to blacken or toast.  SNS knows the meaning of real homemade sausage gravy with pieces of sausage in it and they make soft fluffy biscuits and they know not to place them on the grill to warm/blacken/toast them.  The biscuits and gravy are truly authentic and absolutely amazing.   Now the BBQ well that there is an OMG moment all of it's own as well.  I don't think that there is anything bad on the menu and all are huge portions I can only manage close to half of the biscuits and gravy.   Welll worth the drive and definitely don't judge the book by it's cover here!!!  SNS is truly AMAZING AWESOME real home cooked food and you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times and have always had a great meal! Kim (the Chef) knows her way around a kitchen! She will even come out from the kitchen to ask us how our meal tastes!  I had a cheeseburger yesterday and it was sooooo good! I highly recommend the food and staff!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best bbq in Las Vegas! Great menu, service and food is the best!! A little off the beaten path but way worth the effort!!"}
{"text":"Very good spot for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Every plate I have got here has been loaded with great taste. I highly recommend this place. Great job Mike!"}
{"text":"Typical Vegas crap place, with crap food, crap service and really crappy food. Only truck drivers would like this diarrhea hole. Enjoy the runs if you are eating there and reading this lol"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Food was awesome and well cooked. One of the most delicious breakfast I've had in a long time. I had the biscuits and gravy that tasted like some home good cooking. Nothing frozen here all fresh and just well-made deliciousness. portion sizes were very big. The staff was very friendly and approachable."}
{"text":"Not bad by any means, but good.

We beat the lunch rush and came a bit early. Our waitress, Molly, is such a gem! She's very kind. We had great service and the owner came to check on us during our meal, too. 

A pastrami sandwich, cup of gumbo, and a 3 meat sampler with a side of fries was our order. The pastrami sandwich was huge. JD let me sample some of his meat and I really liked that it wasn't too salty. Sometimes pastrami is inedible to me because of this, but not the case here. The mustard that came with it in the side was fantastic!  

Our 3 meat sampler was a little on the sad side. 3 wings, 3 pieces of brisket and 3 pork ribs. The wings were small but had great flavor. The pork ribs, probably my favorite out of the 3, were real decent. I liked that they weren't sauced up. The brisket was my least favorite. It was a bit oversmoked, with a slightly bitter taste and was sliced thin. It came with a huge basket of fries, though! And the fries were good, too-- not soggy. 

Our bill totaled at just under $40. I'd be lying if I said I left slightly disappointed. I just really feel that the portion sizes could have been bigger with the meat sampler. I try not to be biased, but Jessie Rae's is still king in my book.

All of this being said, I'm definitely coming back for breakfast. I really want to try the pork hash and I'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a new low key BBQ place ever since Hogs Heaven closed down a while back. Man have I ever found it! Got a big glass of excellent sweet tea as soon as we sat down (and I grew up on it in Alabama) and had our food out in less than 5 minutes at around 12:30pm. Awesome service, great food. We will definitely be going back! Keep it up Mike!"}
{"text":"Talk about a DDD joint that Guy F would be proud of!   Like others have said, \"don't judge a book by its cover\".   You're gonna have to look really hard for the signs, but if you make your way through the dingy truck spot destination, you're in for a serendipitous delight.   We went there for a Father's Day breakfast, and we left finding our cool new hidden gem!   Our food was so good, that we were already talking about when we would come back again to try the rest of their menu.  Breakfast ends at 10 or 11 am depending on the day, so if you want to try their lunch BBQ menu, come after 11 just to make sure.   We love supporting local businesses that offer great service, and outstanding food!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal, people! 
I've eaten here twice so far and there is no doubt that I'll be coming back soon. I'm from the southeast and have had a great deal of trouble finding a proper BBQ place here in NV (Carolina Kitchen in Sparks is the only other one that I've found so far). It wasn't until I moved out west that I first heard the term \"Nevada style BBQ\", and it wasn't very long after that that I realized that it was just a euphemism for \"we don't have a clue what we're doing\" or \"just smoke the hell out of it, then cover it in molasses and ketchup\". I mean, come on, it's a sad state of affairs when the best, most authentic BBQ \"joint\" in town is a Dickey's or Famous Dave's, right? Well, now that I know that is very definitely no longer the case, I am beyond happy to sing SNS Diner's praises loud enough for the entire valley to hear. Take heed, suckafoos!
This place is just flat-out awesome and any BBQ (or breakfast) fan really owes it to themselves to check it out. The menu is small, simple, focused and on-point, featuring all of the fare you would expect: pulled pork, beef brisket, ribs, chicken, hot links, hamburgers, baked beans, mac n cheese, etc... The brisket sandwich was very, very good, and so insanely tender that even a toothless person would have no difficulty at all polishing one off. As good as it is though, the real stand-out at SNS (so far) is the pulled pork sandwich! A heaping mound of tender pork topped with homemade slaw and a drizzle of their own spicy mustard on top. I'm not a huge fan of slaw normally, but they do it just right. It's not drenched in profane amounts of mayo and, as odd as it may sound, it has chunks of banana peppers mixed in. The result is something almost too tasty to even be called mere \"slaw\"...and a perfect texture to really set the sandwich off without sogging it down. The smoked beans and macaroni are the only sides I've tried so far, but they were both excellent! In fact, the mac n cheese is probably the best I've had (at a restaurant) in years. They also have several desert items that I fully intend to try one day. If I can ever manage to save enough room for some, that is. Wish me luck.
Okay. So beyond the food, right? The service is genuinely warm and friendly (without being pushy) and welcoming. They actually seem happy to see you come through the door and, I don't know about you, but I really dig that. The place is a little hard to find, being located in an old truck stop type building. And in all honesty, it's a little bit of a dive....just like all the best BBQ joints always are. \"Holes in the wall\" are always your best bet for quality, authentic BBQ, and this place is no different. But also, like other real BBQ joints, the quality of the food more than makes up for any shortfalls in the decorating budget. Just how it should be. I don't know what else to say about this place, but that I'm so glad that we found it! It's quite a drive for us, but I see us making it many more times. Check it out."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, great smoky flavor, and friendly staff, it's a truck stop, or it was so there's plenty of big rig parking."}
{"text":"So when you think of restaurants in Las Vegas BBQ probably not the top of the list. But if you're in North Las Vegas and looking for unbelievably authentic barbecue in the truck stop district of North Las Vegas then SNS diner is the place! This visit we started off with the smoked wings with Carolina sauce on them that were maybe some of the best wings I've ever had anywhere. They were super media and the smoke flavor was unbelievable as well as the sauce so start with them comes with a side of macaroni and cheese it was also off the hook. Wife and I split the brisket sandwich, normally I don't really like brisket, but it was pretty darn good with a squeeze of sauce they have on the table. Had to sweet tea to go on with this to top it off. If you're heading out the 15 north to Salt Lake City or places out in the desert make sure you stop here before you head out it's definitely worth a stop at a good value and nice people"}
{"text":"Great food and great people. You wouldn't know this place was there unless you were looking for it. Give it a try, you won't regret it! Oh and the sweet iced tea is perfectly made!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. We went in and they were closing up at around 4 as they serve from 7 am until 4. Instead of saying they were closed they sat us down and served us with open arms. the food was amazing, everything is homemade except for the fries... but who would want fries when you have homemade mac n cheese, baked beans, potato salad.. anyway we tried the brisket sandwich and the turkey sandwich. The brisket was cooked perfect with a great rub and the most amazing homemade BBQ sauce to ad. The turkey sandwich was topped with fresh cut smoked turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing. It came with a side of homemade gravy that was as close to Crack as I could imagine... I would bathe in it. The buns for the sandwiches were great as well. The sandwiches came with a side and we chose potato salad. It was darn good and reminded me of homemade family picnic salad. We also tried two side hot link which were amazing and about 10 inches long a piece. You could get it separate or with a bun and peppers and onions. 
I highly recommend this place as the owner Mike really puts his heart into making this amazing food.  We met the other cook and she was funny and had passion about the product. Celeste was our server and she made the experience that much better. She really enjoyed working there and she was a great person to talk to. This place is a one of a kind place that is lost in today's business world where the food and conversation bring a feeling of home and do it with a level of care that reflects in the food."}
{"text":"I wanted to give these guys a few months to get the kinks worked out before reviewing it (opening a restaurant is never easy, and there were some stumbles) - now I can safely give it 5 stars. Its not in the best location as far as visibility  (you need to know where to look), but the food is absolutely outstanding. Now every time I stop by I end up with a great meal. Strong coffee, good breakfast, and amazing bbq all of which is made fresh or they wont serve it. Owner is a nice guy and frequently comes out to check how everyone is doing. 

I just cant say enough about the place. Needs to be on \"diners drive ins and dives\"."}
{"text":"Good stop outside of Vegas. We had the brisket and it was plenty of food. The corn bread is amazing. The staff is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Wow, the food was amazing..... Unbelievable homemade everything. The pulled pork/chicken sandwich was Devine. My husband said the best meaty ribs he's ever had. Worth the trip. Dare to go inside it is so worth it."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in a rough. Food was great, nice portions and pleasant wait staff."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service.

I go to this place when I am in Vegas and wanting some good BBQ. The staff was pleasant and always attentive when I have had Molly and Arleana as my waitress but  now they have hired a new person and her name is Liz who is a nightmare and smelled like cigarettes. She seemed very disappointed with my tip that I left her as her face said a thousand words but then her actions told  the rest of the story as she walked away from the table which did not go unnoticed by the staff and customers who saw her reaction as left the table.  I left $8 dollars on a $47 dollar bill for food that some days is great and some days not so great but  to have bad service as well makes it not worth the trip, My advice is fire her before she give SNS bad name as people want good service along with the good food. If you go there make sure to ask to sit at either Arleana's or Molly's table and they will take good care of you with as they have great personalities especially Molly altho both take pride in their jobs on how they serve you good food. While there try the Rib Tips they are great alone with nothing else except of course a send order to go and eat on the road."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Rosemary in the biscuits and gravy...fresh veggies in the omelette ...awesome smokey flavor potatoes.

We're coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a Diamond in the rough! Don't judge the outside by what you think the food will be like. 
Nice diner atmosphere, black, orange and grey decor and clean! 

If your over by nellis come to SNS before you try Memphis BBQ. 

SNS by far is fresh, flavorful and the employees working here are so nice and polite!!! Everyone was welcoming and asked how things were. 

Plus the give 10% military discount and that is always a plus. 

Will be back with kids next time. Thank u"}
{"text":"This place isn't much to look at, but I didn't decide to eat here for its looks. I heard it had great barbecue and great barbecue it has! From the smoked chicken to the ribs, this place sports some of the best barbecue I've had in a very long time. The wonderfully nice ladies working there are also very helpful. OUTSTANDING FOOD!"}
{"text":"Im not in love with this place, but I do like it.  It's inside a shady looking truck stop area, but inside it is like a normal diner style restaurant.  

The service was pretty good.  We had the BBQ for lunch.  It wasn't authentic style BBQ but it was tasty.  The Brisket was juicy not a lot of smoke though.  The coleslaw was a vinaigrette style and it was a nice compliment to the meat.  The beans were good too.  The ribs were tender fall off the bone, but not too much smoke flavor.  All very good.

I will go back just too check out other menu items - maybe some breakfast.  I do like because it is a total hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside appearance fool you. 

The diner makes fresh food every day and you can tell in the way you take a bite out of anything on the menu. 

My girlfriend and myself had biscuits and gravy and french toast. You can tell the biscuits were freshly made every morning and the meets were not frozen. 

I went to talk with the server Celeste and the breakfast chef Charles and they came out and discussed how they get fresh produce and make their meats in the smokers. 

A special thank you to the owner for vouching for getting fresh produce, you deserve the great ratings your restaurant receives."}
{"text":"Gem off the beaten path. Stopped here for a delicious dinner after a day trip to Valley of Fire. Service was amazing and food was stellar. Brisket and sweet tea were great. Cornbread was amazing! Skip the mac and cheese though."}
{"text":"Fantastic food n experience. Huge portions. Quality meats and excellent customer service.  All this in a genuine diner setting. Real truckers and everyday working class people eating here. We Guam folk enjoyed ourselves tremendously.  They're on to something here."}
{"text":"Breathe taking, awesome BBQ.  Little hard to find, but way worth it !  Look for the SNS sign !"}
{"text":"drove to this place today from my house. about 20 miles.  so worth it. like the description states in some reviews, it's a little joint and what they save on aesthetics at this truckstop they clearly clearly put into the food.

I had to three meat combo. The ribs and meats were so flavorful you really didn't need to sauce. The mustard sauce is terrific. I have to point that out because it is fantastic on the brisket. They get creative with the mac& cheese and the cornbread is really good.

I went after lunch rush I really got to talk to the staff and the owner Mike. They're all so passionate about this food, it is evident in the flavor and care it's prepared with.

The portions are big and the price is great.If you're in the area exit 46 off 15 N. Or nowhere near this place, stop in anyway. You will not be disappointed. PS try the apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"Very good food had brisket sandwich and potato salad, husband had sandwich and smoked beans. Large portions. All homemade food, did not save enough room for dessert. Fina our server was fantastic. Would go back again. Was skeptical at first as it is in an industrial area."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at SNS Diner in North Las Vegas.  Celeste and Arleena are so wonderful and good at their jobs.  I tried the wings for the first time and they were the best wings in town and I will be ordering them every time I go there.  There isn't enough time or space to suggest what to order since everything is good.  Give this place a chance, you will not be disappointed and it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Don't let the location scare you.   The service and food are EXCELLENT!!!   Celeste was our server and she has a bright and welcoming smile.   I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great BBQ, breakfast, specials. 
I have never been disappointed. Great staff also. 
I come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Just driving through Vegas on our way from Utah to California. Found this place on Yelp and I'm so glad we stopped. We didn't want fast food and this place hit the spot. Don't let looks deceive you. Seems like a family run joint, super friendly and great service. The food was fantastic. I had the brisket sandwich and my boyfriend got the pastrami hash. We both devoured our food. I would highly recommend stopping here for some amazing home cooked BBQ!"}
{"text":"Totally worth it! Suck it up and brave the rough road, beyond the closed road barricade, through the big rig gas pumps, near the grimy parking spaces. A sign reminiscent of the old STP placard, \"SNS\", will become recognizable on a circa 1970 outlying building. I thought Mark Hamill might walk straight out of Corvette Summer movie to check on the smoker in the back. But once in, we were warmly greeted and drink orders taken immediately. 

I ordered the 3 meat combo plate that came out in foil compartments in a plastic basket. Just missing frosty cold mugs for root beer, this is a great greasy spoon diner. Truckers, military, delivery people, young couples, a man in a suit in the corner, workmen speaking Spanish, all visited this place while I was there. Some of the owners/cooks will pass by, calling out food and truck driver requirements. Drinks are limited but I had an unsweetened iced tea. My combo had brisket, pulled pork and ribs. Sides were potato salad, pork beans, corn bread, and berry cobbler with vanilla ice cream. 

Trust the reviewers who actually made it in this place to eat. Get the brisket. It's some of the best this side of Austin, TX. The cornbread is almost perfect with whole soft kernels still in the mix. It's not too sweet and you can really taste corn more than sugar. The ribs and pulled pork were good but not the best in Vegas. 

Here's a suggestion: shop Road Kill Grill and  SNS together. They're not far apart. Get the brisket and cornbread at SNS. Then, get the ribs, sausage and pulled pork from RKG. 

Service was good and pretty quick. Don't let the outside fool you. SNS is quaint but tastes like really good homemade food. Get there early if you want to try the special. I may catch some flak for this but it's better than Capriotti's Bobbie. The sandwich is like Thanksgiving in a sandwich, smoked turkey, homemade cranberry sauce, stuffing, and gravy in a bun.

Although a diamond in the rough, SNS is fantastic in a nostalgic Route66 kind of manner. Pick up might be the way to go if you are used to higher and more modern end of eateries. Don't expect a bistro. But expect good smoked meats at a good price."}
{"text":"The smoked pulled chicken sandwich was amazing! The slaw and spicy mustard on a grilled bun is the best I have ever tasted. Everyone is so friendly and the food is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by its outer appearance and location! This place is a gen if great food and friendly service. If o was a local this would be my \"Cheers\""}
{"text":"Happened to drive by a month ago and smelled the food cooking and said WOW!  Got a big order of Rib Tibs...they were fantastic.  I have now been back a few times and tried their combo with brisket and ribs.  I really thought the ribs were excellent and my buddy loves their brisket.  I have had breakfast twice...Denver Omelet twice...the ham it has is smoke there and so good.  Huge portion of potatoes with it.  I like their barbeque sauce on both.  All three ladies that have been my waitresses have been fantastic.  I saw the burger and fries coming out when I was there and they looked incredible so that is next on the list.  Yum!"}
{"text":"We got there after 11, but the waitress and cook still allowed us to order breakfast. One star.

I ordered a three meat plate to split with my bf that was getting breakfast. I ordered ribs, brisket and chicken with homemade Mac n cheese. One star, my bf liked the ribs, and I liked the brisket but only with extra BBQ sauce. 

My bf ordered the pastrami hash and a side of biscuits and gravy. The hash had mushrooms that he doesn't like and the meat was burnt. He said the best part was the gravy but not worth $8.00. 

Not sure we'll return. The service was really good though!"}
