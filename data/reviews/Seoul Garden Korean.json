{"text":"Was here this afternoon and it appears they might be closing for good. There is a sign on the door that says the rent hadn't been paid so their lease is being terminated. I hope this turns out because I love this place"}
{"text":"Oh how things can change in a few short years...

Two years ago I went here with family and we had an amazing lunch. We went back last weekend and unfortunately I can't say the same. 

The quality of the food has really deteriorated. The kimchi selections and the meats weren't as fresh and tasty as the first time, and both myself and another family member felt a little queasy after the meal. 

They also have a new thing where they put a piece of parchment paper over the bbq grill at your table. I realized after we started that this is a little trick to disguise how filthy the grills are. As you start grilling this little sheet of paper will do little to keep the black and charred remains of previous meals off your food. 

I found it annoying that the tip was automatically added to the bill - especially after receiving such mediocre service. Customers should be the ones to decide if and how much they want to tip. 

Look closely and you'll notice the plastic plants throughout the restaurant are covered in about two inches of dust. 

This place has totally lost its soul."}
{"text":"The food quality here is above average, however, the service is questionable even when it's not a busy day. I love all the side dishes; especially the pancake, potato, and seaweed! I love the beef here because of the marinade that they put on it and the porridge at the beginning is always a good appetizer. All in all, the food quality is better when compared to other AYCE kbbq places, but the service and price is still not justified for me. I will come here occasionally, but only if it's on my way."}
{"text":"THE GOOD:
1. High quality meats, especially the beef.  Food was very fresh and there were about 8 side dishes offered as well as an interesting congee appetizer.  Everything is refillable.  
2. Plenty of seating.

THE SO SO:
Needs to offer more variety of veggies.  Service could be more prompt.  Our server forgot items throughout the night and often walked away before we finished asking for what we wanted.  I still give the place 4 stars because the food quality and value out weighed her service and there was a second server who was very good.

THE BAD:
Everything will smell like barbeque when you leave.  Don't wear your nice coat or sweaters."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends on a Friday at 9:30pm.  There were only two other tables that were being served.  I was surprised the place was empty on a Friday night because I've usually found KBBQ places to be packed.  We realized the late night discount started at 10pm so we asked if we could get the discount because it was so close to 10pm.  The server said it was fine, but we wouldn't be served until 9:50pm.  We were all happy they made the accommodation for us.  Regular dinner is $18.99.  Late night (10pm-1am) is $11.99.

Late night AYCE gets you beef, beef ribs, chicken, pork, vegetables, and side dishes. A regular dinner will give you all the above with pork belly, fish, and shrimp.

They put paper down on the grill so it's not difficult to clean the grill after you're done.  We didn't like this because it doesn't give the meat a nice grill mark.  It does keep the meat juicy though.  The server initially put our meat on the grill for us (I guess to show you not to put the meat on the sides). They only changed the paper once.  

Everything was okay except for the beef ribs.  They were really fatty and lacked flavour.  

Side dishes were \"meh\".  The sweet potatoes are served cold with an orange sauce.  I didn't like them cold.  But the candy they give you with the bill is really good.

Side note:  The decor is quite Italian-looking compared to other KBBQ places.  If you look up at the lamps you'll notice that they are covered in the thickest amount of dust ever.  Dust hangs in clumps off of the lamps.  Lovely."}
{"text":"There's not much to say about this place, but that doesn't mean it was bad.  

It's AYCE Korean BBQ, not much different from any of the other similar places around town, except this one is smack in the heart of Market Village/Pacific Mall, so chances are you will be pulling you hair out trying to 1) navigate into the parking lot and 2) getting a spot close to where you want to go!!  But I digress...

Service on the night I came was not too stellar.  It took a long time to be served all those little side dishes you get at these places (kimchi, chap jae noodles, radishes, potatoes, etc.).

Lack of quick service notwithstanding, the food was above average for an AYCE KBBQ place.  The whole look of the place is actually interesting, as the structure is circular and is reminiscent of a Mediterranean Villa, complete with a useless upper balcony level!!  :D

Anyway, good cuts of food (which, as is customary, you have to cook yourself), service could be better, but all-in-all, a decent night out for AYCE."}
{"text":"This was the third Korean BBQ place I tried after Korean Grillhouse in Toronto and Miga in Mississauga at the time and I must say this was maybe one of the most disappointing eating out experiences i've had in recent memory. The food was decent (kaibi beef being the only standout and a personal favorite) while the service was, not to sound harsh, one of the  worst I've ever experienced.

I had to constantly get up and hail down a server for help to do almost everything from asking for a utensil to getting a refill for my drink. This happened on a Sunday afternoon when they clearly had more employees on the floor than customers.

So all in all would not recommend.

Try out Axia instead which as a plus is located in the same mall."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to revisit this restaurant and was left pretty disappointed. Got the bulgogi combo which comes with banchans, bulgolgi, a soup, rice, lettuce and some other things I don't quite remember. Pretty good portion for two people. Food is pretty good, I think they changed ownership though because the meat isn't as well marinated as it was in the past, and the ladies that worked here before aren't there anymore. Also they no longer have the real charcoal grills that I liked oh so very much in the past. Service though was kinda split. The female owner was really nice, while the male owner was pretty nonchalant. Dropped this place a star because some genius thought it would be a good idea to put a piece of parchment paper on the grill to prevent the grill from sticking. It is actually terribly inconvenient after awhile because the paper slips and slides while you are trying to adjust the positioning of the meat. Overall, this idea only serves the waitstaff because instead of having to change the whole grill, they only have to replace the paper. However, customers like me would rather go somewhere where I won't have to get mad at a piece of paper. 

Overall, still a decent restaurant, but I love it significantly less now that I have better knowledge of Korean food, and also because of the aforementioned factors. Still, the quality and quantity of banchans is still pretty enticing."}
{"text":"Walked in with family on Friday evening with very few patrons.  Maybe it's the competition and the cost to keep the prices low for Korean BBQ but the meats just lacked much favour, just giving an overall neutral taste.  The fish, was over salted.  Not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"The food is not that tasty.. Just a lot of meat and that's it.. The thing that i don't like is no lettuce included, all extra price... At least it should be 1 dish of lettuce for every 2 person.. Eating Korean BBQ with no lettuce is no sense"}
{"text":"Located in Market Village (Markham) and honestly, the best Korean AYCE BBQ I've had. You can also opt for al la carte as well.

For dinner AYCE, it is $18.99 with the selections of pork, ribs, beef, chicken, squid, and shrimp.  It comes with side dishes (radishes, bean sprouts, tofu, kimchi). It even gives you Korean style fried pancakes and a whole pot of beef stew as the other side dish.

The Meat:
Ever complain about having thinly sliced beef and pork at other Korean BBQ restaurants? Well, you won't here.

They supply quality marinated meat. It is flavourful and savoury. Even after the cooking the meat, the moisture and flavour still remains. It's delicious!

The service:
Quick, attentive, and ensures that your tea/water is filled, and BBQ plate is changed when it is dirty (without being asked)

Comparatively, cost is pricier than the usual Korean BBQ AYCE, but well worth it.  

I've been here for years. And will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite korean restaurant. Lots of side dishes and a variety of meats, all of which taste pretty good. Reasonable price."}
{"text":"A meal on a Friday afternoon, and the grills were heated up for you to cook. The copious amounts of meat and condiments make this the go-to Korean restaurant I go to. The quality defintely varies among the marinated meats. My personal favourite is the beef and pork. Not so stellar are the chicken which is usually bland. I'd reccommend to people who wanna give the cook it yourself grill a try."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. The circular layout of the restaurant is so unique. The only drawback is the service. There was only one waitress for the whole restaurant and she was working her butt off. I sorta felt sorry for her because even though there were only about 6-7 tables being served she did not stop for a moment. The AYCE BBQ is pretty decent and the seasoning of the meat is a bit on the sweet side which is what I prefer anyway. But when I mention the word love 3 times above its really for the side dishes. They had some of my favorites like the glass noodle, radish and of course kimchii. Whats even better is the unlimited refillability of the side dishes. I'm embarrassed to say but I enjoyed the side dishes so much during this meal I got the waitress to refill the ones I liked 3 times. I'm so easy to please that side dishes make me happy. I was super stuffed at the end and I for one got my moneys worth."}
{"text":"i came here during a busy hour but i still expected better service. very inconsistent service compared to my first visit which was later during the evening with less people. 
we went for AYCE both times

my first visit, the pork was super good and they gave us congee and a delicious soup.

but omg my second visit was just plain BAD! there were a lot of people, and after we were seated, we asked for water. LITERALLY, we asked about 4 times during our time there and the water came to us at about half an hr into our meal. later, we asked for more meat and side dishes: we asked for pork, beef and potatoes, during this duration, they came to turn off our burner about 3 times cus they thought we were done and i had to remind them about my meat about 2 times and in the end, only our pork came but the burner had to be turned on again and it took like 15 mins to took our meat, and the taste was just not as good as last time. we also asked if congee and soup came with the meal cus it did last time and the lady said it was too busy that day and they were giving it out or something, i didnt even really catch was she said. -.- then i asked another lady if we could order the soup and so she placed the order for us, about 15 mins later, the soup finally came, it was srsly SO salty i dont even know how to drink the darn thing. and we ran out of water but asking for that was like impossible. the place was just so unorganized, we had like 5 different people waiting on us. we just got so frustrated and half the time we were there, we were just waiting for someone to come by our table, we were there for about 2 hrs because finding a waiter to talk to was impossible!"}
{"text":"Food here is tasty and delicious. Quality ingredients. 

Side dishes are good, about 5-6 varieties, the usual sprouts, kimchi, pancake, sweetened potato, radish and carrots. 

Prices here are just slightly higher than average. eg pork bone soup is around $8 instead of $5-6. 

Service here is really really slow. I've been here four times and every single time, it seems like only one person is running the floor. Do not come here if you are in a rush. You'll become super irate. 

Atmosphere is nice and airy. Huge ceiling and European feel."}
{"text":"I think they recently switched owners or decided they should change their menu and chef. I have a huge pet peeve with restaurants serving dirty dishes or nasty table tops. This place had both. The cups we were given had spots of dried up hot sauce on the sides. The table top was visibly dirty even after we asked them to wipe it off. Another pet peeve I hate with restaurants is not covering their foods properly. Usually Korean foods has a lot of side dishes and some of these places decides its ok to leave these side dishes in the open. Their side dishes were alright, good variety and they aren't cheap with their portions. 

I ordered a chicken Katsu and bf orderd a pork bone soup. My lunch came with a miso soup, again the bowl was dirty. The sides of the bowl had visible stains and dirt. I was turned off by the dirt so I didn't try the soup but it looked pretty standard. My chicken katsu came and it was dry. So dry the chicken was basically curled up and a dark brown. The salad that came with it was still wet from the washing. Who in the world serves water salad? The dressing on top looked like it came out of a ketchup bottle. I wouldn't recommend this dish to anyone. 

BF's pork bone soup looked like it had good color but it was surprisingly thick. It didn't feel like soup, it looked more like a gravy. I tried the pork and it was moist with good flavor but it was impossible to put the rice into the soup because that would've been way too thick to eat. It would've been like eating congee. 

Their service was alright besides the fact that the servers didn't really understand English and they just stand there looking lost when you ask for something. 

Overall I don't like places that serves with dirty dishes and visibly dirty cups. I wouldn't eat at this place again since the food wasn't particually good either."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! I had my first korean BBQ here and immediately fell in love.

The meats are high quality, and they are delicious when cooked. The side dishes are really yummy as well, potatoes, pancakes, kimchi... you can also get rice and soup. I ate so much food here that I had to spend the whole afternoon shopping at P-mall to walk it off.

The restaurant itself is very cute. Looks small from the entrance but it's actually quite big and bright inside. It is literally a garden. The staff were really friendly too."}
{"text":"Instead of fighting with the crowds at Pac Mall, I decided to stop and eat here.  On a Sunday, early afternoon, I'd say that the place was half-full.  Dining room has an interesting, circular set up that resembles a garden/terrace, with Euro influence, hence the name of the restaurant.

We were at the entrance, looking at the menu, undecided about whether or not we were actually gonna eat here when a waitress approached us and enticed us inside.   

We decided NOT to do AYCE as we'd all hafta do it and we weren't that hungry.  At $11.99 for lunch on a weekend, it was quite reasonable, but then again, how much meat can 1 person eat??

After ordering, we were given about 7 banchans that included:  kimchi, slices of pickled (& sweet!) daikon, sprouts, potatoes with a sweet syrup sauce, pieces of fish cake, jap chae (glass noodles), & seaweed.  Even though we weren't doing AYCE, side dishes were refilled upon request which is a bonus!  I believe they also give you a small pancake as well.   

I ordered the beef brisket soup that came with a bowl of rice.  Honestly, I enjoyed the side dishes more as I found the soup a bit watered down despite the red colour.  Not spicy at all.  Also there wasn't too much meat, more green onions, and other veg fillers.

We also ordered a kimchi pancake which was more on the sweet than spicy side, a bit on the bland side.  Despite this, flavour was good, but texture was a bit too wet and soggy.

Good value for the amount of food we were given, but this place is more about QUANTITY over quality!  Service was pleasant, no complaints about that."}
{"text":"The side dishes were so good and they have all the popular ones not just a few. It was a good sign right from the start. 

The meat was not really anything special but it got the job done. Meaning it was standard Korean BBQ albeit not being super authentic. 

The service was mediocre. Did not smile but was overall polite. 

Would come again when carnivorous craves resurfaces."}
{"text":"For an all you can eat KBBQ, the ban chans here are so good.
The meat quality is fantastic and their service is great. Everything feels clean and well- prepared. 

For 18.99 you can get
- pork (good)
- beef (soy sauce marinade)
- short ribs (okay)
- chicken (my favourite)
- shrimp (unpeeled)
- fish (okay)
- zucchini and yam
- kimchi soup
- rice
- lots of different ban chan.

Also good to note that their grills is pretty modern, and they put a piece of paper on the grill and the paper gets switched pretty often."}
{"text":"This place definitely slaps chako and Korean grill house in the face.  Not only they serve 10 different side dishes,  they also use high quality thick pieces of marinated meat.  They also use a sheet of paper over the grill so it doesn't burn as quickly.  Selection of choices include beef rib,  beef,  pork,  chicken,pork belly,  shrimp, fish,  and vegetable. You get the same selection regardless you go on a weekday or weekend. Now that I've tried this,  you can't pay me to go eat at chako and Korean grill house again."}
{"text":"BEST KOREAN BBQ in Toronto! Enough Said. The meat is thick and portions are big. A MUST TRY1"}
{"text":"This place has been here a while, but my family has never tried it - we always end up opting for the Chinese goodies at Market Village and Pacific Mall instead. :P But this week, we wanted AYCE Korean BBQ and we asked a friend who works in the area for a recommendation.

Our friend told us that Seoul Garden was one of her faves because it's owned and operated by Koreans and is very authentic. So we had dinner there and loved it!

ATMOSPHERE: Warm and friendly. Décor's dated, but the KBBQ tables are top notch. Place is very clean.

SERVICE: Staff but can be a little on the slow because 3 servers were looking after the entire restaurant. But they were very nice - soft spoken and friendly manner. They check on the tables regularly making sure tea is refilled and paper on the grill is changed every so often.

PRICE: A bit pricier for the usual AYCE at $18.99 for dinner. Late night dinner (11pm to 1am) is $11.99.

FOOD: Tasty side dishes: kimchi, bean sprouts, seaweed, potatoes, etc. Nicely sliced meats and veggies for BBQ. The meats are marinated well with different flavours. My faves were the pork and chicken. It was also great to have so much veggies available for grilling too! There were onions, mushrooms, squash and sweet potato.

Would definitely go back for BBQ, and would be interested to try a la carte items too!"}
