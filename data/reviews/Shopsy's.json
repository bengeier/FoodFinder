{"text":"Worst corn beef sandwich in a long while, this chain's quality has greatly diminished. I'm unlikely to return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I spontaneously decided to come here because we were craving hotdogs. We came at 1pm on a friday and it was soo dead. only a handful of other people we here (we probably missed the lunch rush). We both got philly dogs and they were alright, nothing special and my latke was was burnt =(

Service was nice and friendly here butttt with these prices, I think I rather eat street meat."}
{"text":"The hash here tasted a lot better before.Not sure if they hired another chef but s/he has to chef it out better! Cook with care and make a marriage with all the ingredients."}
{"text":"The Big K and I visited here to take advantage of a Groupon coupon and being in the mood for a corned beef on rye, it was perfect timing.  The corned beef is a lean cut and piled high on ultra-fresh rye bread with a pickle and slightly watery cole-slaw on the side.   The accompanying latke (or your choice of fries or potato salad) was crisp and not-overly greasy.  There`s lots to choose on the menu.  The restaurant located in an office/industrial area is spacious, super-clean and although a little utilitarian in design it suits the neighbourhood.    Prices are cheaper than the downtown Shopsy`s location.  Service throughout our meal was charming and absolutely impeccable."}
{"text":"I had all but written off Shopsy's Deli. Too many undercooked meals at their Toronto locations and service that left something to be desired. My opinion was recently given a complete overhaul as Shopsy's Markham became the location for a recent YRSBiz tweet-up.

Part of the appeal of Shopsy's is it's classic Deli look and feel, some of the downtown locations have received fancy makeovers and cross the border boarder of greasy spoon to sophisticated dining. This location is on the brink of one such makeover with the introduction of a new owner/management. I'm looking forward

Once initial talks were over the staff proceeded to bring out tray after tray of canape style versions of some of their favourites with special twists on them to amaze us. And amaze they certainly did, the staff was on point with going into great detail explaining each dish as they were brought out. Describing the ingredients and making this already full patron reconsider just how much room he could spare to fit in a sandwich...or two....or 6. Oy Vay!

Here is the menu we were treated to:
1. Beef Burger sliders with wasabi mayo and French fried onions.
2. Fresh shaved smoked turkey sliders (sandwiches)
3. Chicken quesadilla with chpotle sauce drizzled on top
4. Smoked meat (corned beef) slider with Dijon mustard on an onion bun

For desert the offered up a buttermilk pancake with an apple compote dine with what I recall was a burbon/whiskey glaze.... Holy Food boner Batman!!! Wow.

Aside from desert my favourite of the lot definitely had to be the smoked meat and the beef slider (the wasabi mayo and french fried onions made a huge difference). Deliscious!!

Had an opportunity to have a breif chat with the new manager and owner and this guy \"gets it\". He is all about customer service and doing what it takes to repair the image of this once failing restaurant. I'm more than excited to see this new and improved Shopsy's rise up to smoked meat and slider glory once again."}
{"text":"I was at FedEx shipping my toothbrush and noticed this place. I was feeling peckish so I thought I would go in and check it out. Service was friendly. The food was decent. No complaints but didn't blow me away. The best part of this place is it's close to the FedEx for all your shipping and snacking needs. #ItIsWhatItIs"}
{"text":"Was really craving a smoked meat sandwich. It was so good and competes with the deli places around the GTA. The place is a little dated but clean and plenty of seating. TVs all around and lots of parking."}
{"text":"Shopsy's was across the street from my hotel, so I had breakfast there on a few of my visits to Toronto.  I did not realize there were other locations. 

The place is rather large, with plenty of tables and booths (preferred).  The staff is pleasant, and the clientele seemed a mix of young and old, rich and poor.  The coffee came quickly, and was good.  The breakfast menu offered what you would expect.  I had the French Toast on one occasion, and a veggie omelet on a second visit.  Both were good, but nothing to write home about (however, we are asked to Yelp* about such things, and I willingly oblige). 

Yes. There are better breakfasts to be found, but I was quite satisfied with what I ate in Shopsy's, and would certainly stop in again for its location and convenience."}
{"text":"Closed at 4pm on a Wednesday with no warning whatsoever. There was a female employee mopping the place and closing up, but apparently could not be bothered with updating business hours online.

Wasted my time and gas. Zero stars."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this humble deli/diner. We were served by who we later found out was the owner. Her husband is the chef. We tipped our hats off to the delicious home made holondaise sauce on the benedict eggs and the montreal deli meat was to die for. It was all sitting on a moist but hefty muffin with a kick. It was our first time trying peameal (? ) and were so happy we did. It was a nice escape from where we were staying. Next time we'll try a breakfast cocktail to seal the deal. Many thanks and hope to visit again soon! P.S: fellow Americans, heads up, Canadians don't know what Canadian Bacon is! ;P"}
{"text":"Roast beef on an onion bun with a side of fries. Roast beef not as juicy as Katz's. Fries better than McDonald's."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a long time ago, but decided to drop by for breakfast on a Saturday late monring....around 11pm. The place was clean, and I decided to order the Shopsy's Featured breakfast.  The portion and the price was very reasonable, however I found the service quite slow....I'll have to come back again for their Lunch, or Dinner to really get a good sense of this place."}
{"text":"Solid montreal smoked meat sandwich. Not completely blown away but very good. Good service and got my food quickly. The fries are very tasty aswell. Well priced as well. Definitely a solid deli to stop by if ur in the area."}
{"text":"This is a solid no nonsense diner. The omelets were very good with delicious home fries. My son enjoyed the kids grilled cheese. Service was polite and prompt.  Quite reasonably priced as well.Only negative was the subpar coffee."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday during lunch hours. There were not may customers so service was really good. The place is quite large and very open. 

Tried their Ruben sandwich and smoked meat sandwich. Both came with coleslaw, pickle and a choice of fries, mash potato or hash brown.  Both meals were $13 each.

There was a very generous portion of sliced meat. Although the meat was soft and tender it does not compare to the one at Pancer's Deli Emporium. Everything tasted pretty good overall. My only really complaint was the bread. Didn't taste so fresh as it crumbled when held and I wish the bread was toasted."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese is cheesy gooey goodness. It's greasy, there's no fancy bread crust and the noodles are overcooked to soft, but it's the kind of satisfying mac and cheese you get when you crave the creamy and saucy mac and cheese your cafeteria used to serve.

Unfortunately, at $11 it cost a lot more than the cafeteria I remember (I recall it was $3.50 for half the size). Fortunately, it is served with fries without argument (though I did have to ask specifically for it). My actual preference was for mashed potatoes but they didn't have any an hour before closing. I added $2 for a Caesar salad but ended up with a Greek salad instead. The small bowl the salad was served in was impractical for eating / mixing the cheese, but fortunately there's a decently sized plate beneath the salad.

We were part of their quarterly newsletter and had a $10 off $30 coupon valid only in the evenings (until the end of January). Unfortunately, this location isn't open for Sundays anymore... unfortunate because it would've been a good place for a Sunday brunch! 

They don't have wifi, but it seems temporary (wasn't working)."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Markham Shopsy's location for years. I live in the city, so it's convenient. I don't visit as often as I should. I'm averaging once every quarter of each year!

Each time, Nick has served me. He is always friendly and responsive. He is never intrusive. He makes you feel comfortable eating there and remembers who you are. He greeted me by wishing me a happy new year. I was dining alone, so he seated me where I was facing the TV. He also heard me slurping the nearly bottom of my Diet Coke beverage and immediately got me another one. He calls me sweetheart, which is charming and sweet. 

The deli food here is incredible. I had the Reuben Reuben. The smoked meat was tender and yummy. The toasted bread was perfect. I loved the sauerkraut in the sandwich. It also came with fries and a pickle, but you can substitute the former with a salad or onion rings. 

I have also ordered the Bill Cosby (before the recent controversy surrounding him, so I am not sure how that platter is doing these days), cabbage rolls, corned beef with eggs breakfast special, and more. Everything I have indulged in so far has been fabulous. 

I prefer this location more than the downtown one. It's comfortable and staff are always friendly. The food never disappoints me."}
