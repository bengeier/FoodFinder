{"text":"Terrible! I am a Mexican food aficionado and this was not even worth the price. The service was terrible and they forgot our food only to come back and try and lie about the mistake. The food was thrown together like they just took whatever was available to them that resembled what we ordered. Rice was dry and the beans had little bits of hot dog. Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"It was under staffed. Better like sharing they ration out that salsa in single shallow bowls. Better not drink that soda too fast because it will me a hot minute before you get any more. Place has gone down hill since 09."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican restaurant with standard dishes. Prices have gone up over the last few years, which is the reason for the three stars. Their quesadillas are delicious."}
{"text":"The fact that this place is located in an old fast food restaurant is hilarious to me. It's your typical Mexican restaurant, located in an old Arby's. You can still tell from the outside that it used to be part of the fast food nation, but Fiesta Margarita added some Mexican flair to it which makes it even funnier.

Once inside, you still will think you need to head to the counter to order, but it actually is a sit down restaurant with pretty good food. Heck, the counter area is now the bar in the place. Anyways, the food here is good, not great, so expect your typical Mexican fare.

First time my girlfriend & I went here, we ordered a pitcher of Margarita's...but I'm pretty sure they gave us virgin Margarita's. We didn't want to ask so we just decided to order some shots of tequila that we proceeded to dump into our Ritas. I will say that they were good though; whether they actually had alcohol in them or not, I'm not sure.

Fiesta Margarita amuses me with their transformation of an Arby's into a Mexican restaurant, but they did a good job at it. I like the reuse concept...considering I am an environment nut. So expect good food for a good price, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"One of my favorite's!  The chicken chili con queso is my go to comfort food.  Their prices are super affordable and they usually get you in and out rather quickly or you can hang out."}
