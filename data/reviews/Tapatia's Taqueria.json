{"text":"Very poor service. The waitress wasn't helpful nor knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered tacos and a burrito. We asked for chips and salsa since it's a taqueria, the owner replied \"that's not Mexican maybe you should look somewhere else\". The food that was put on the table was raw tortilla with boiled meat with no toppings. We paid for the drinks and walked out. The man yells we don't need your money, mind you we were the only customers in there...."}
{"text":"So good!! I went with three of my friends and not only did we order two rounds of food, but also two rounds of dessert. Great food. Great prices. We even met the owners and talked about upcoming changes. Very excited they moved in! Will definitely be returning. The Churros were A-MAZE-ING!!!"}
{"text":"Goood food, great atmosphere. Staff was very helpful. So far I had the tacos but hopefully the whole menus is good."}
{"text":"Great food with attentive and friendly staff. 

We've been here three times and had the chorizo/pastor  tacos, chorizo/carnitas sopes, ceviche tostadas, pastor burrito and camaron quesadilla de maiz. All really good and authentic, but the corn tortilla on the quesadilla de maiz was exceptional. The burrito was comically large and delicious.

The salsa bar is fully loaded with varying  degrees of verde and roja sauce along with pickled and fresh veggies 

The frosty margs and palomas are good and strong. Get the grande!"}
{"text":"I came here this weekend for my boyfriends birthday. I had carnitas taco and the barbacoa corn quesadillas. I was interested in trying corn style I've never seen that on a menu before. The tortilla part was a little thicker than I expected but it was really good. The meat was cooked perfectly and well seasoned same goes for the meat in the tacos. 


The tacos may seem a little bare but the woman at the counter directs you to the salsa bar there they have limes and shredded lettuce, pico all that good stuff. They even supply little containers with lids. I like when places do that frees up the kitchen a bit and let's you have sauce on the side, that's the best option for to go orders. I will try the desserts next time:)

The interior is simple and clean looking. Very nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"The food is good, and it's reasonably priced. I've tried a few of the quesadillas, both flour and corn tortilla options are good. I think the carnitas corn quesadilla was the best. Nice to see a place like this in West Park. They deliver on UberEats which is nice too."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch after a friends recommendation. The food was great and sauce bar complimented that really well. This is the first place in cleveland that we've found that serves quesadillas in a corn shell which as delicious! Highly recommend the chorizo. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, clean restaurant, we ended up trying the chicken and shrimp tacos.  This place only gets three stars in my opinion because of the service. The staff here seemed confused as to why we wanted to eat here and made us feel intrusive. The owner(I'm assuming since he had all his bills laid out on the bar) kept whispering to the waitress  and looking our way. Needless to say I won't be back but the food was actually good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place and what better time than National Taco Day? I got three tacos. Chorizo was my favorite, chicken, then steak. They have a salsa bar with a lot of options (onions, cilantro, radishes, sour cream, various salsas, and more) I really liked that. I also got a side of rice and beans which was tasty. The place was clean and our server was friendly. I will definitely be heading to back to try different menu items."}
{"text":"I moved to Cleveland from Houston and have been living here for a year and have finally found bomb tacos for cheap as they should be! If you think Barrio is the best taco place in Cleveland, don't come here..."}
{"text":"This place is great! I discovered it randomly on Yelp and decided to come in and try it. I am so happy I did. I ordered a tostada and 2 tacos (which was a bit too much food). They have a salsa bar that includes a few different salsas, chopped onion and cilantro, tomatoes and pico, and some delicious pickled onions/jalape√±os. It is delicious Mexican street food in a casual atmosphere, really cheap prices ( less than $10), great service, and a huge bar!!! Cleveland needs more places like this. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Best pastor I've had in Ohio and that was after it stayed in a to go container for a while. Can't wait to try it fresh. Highly recommend the Torta."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Great service & authentic tacos! I got a shrimp taco, fish taco, & shrimp quesadilla and they were all mouth watering! Went with 7 people total, we all got different things and everyone loved it! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican sanmys around! Tapatias Taqueria now has full bar & draft beer! Can't ever go wrong with Corona, Modelo, or Pacifico!"}
{"text":"New favorite taco spot in the city. 

I just moved into this neighborhood, Jefferson/West Park, a couple weeks ago and drove by this place every day on my way to and from work. I can't believe it took me this long to try it, because OH MY GOODNESS, what quality.

The tacos are authentic, with so many meat choices. I ordered the pollo tacos, as well as the al pastor. I'm completely content with having these tacos for the rest of my days. That's how tasty they were! So full of flavor, juicy, and the corn tortillas were perfect.

You can garnish them how you like at the garnish/condiments bar in the middle of the restaurant. So many things to choose from: cilantro, onion, pickled onions, tomatoes, lettuce, jalapenos, all of the salsas, and even sour cream. 

My fiance got a burrito and it was the size of his face. The prices are super reasonable. We ordered a burrito, re-fried beans, 3 tacos and unlimited amounts of toppings for less than $20.

If you're on the west side and want to try a different authentic taco spot (we all know where everyone usually goes - cough cough La Plaza) get here pronto. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just opened on Lorain Avenue in Cleveland's Westown neighborhood and features authentic street tacos and other menu items.

I had the chorizo and chicken tacos with a side of rice and beans.  The protein came out very conservatively seasoned, but that was a good thing because they have a toppings bar with a nice selection of salsas, cilantro, onions and other items which allows you to have your tacos just how you like them! 

Washed it down with a strawberry Jarritos and left happy!

BUENO!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time today, lunch to go. Had Lunch Chorizo Plate $7.99 not very impressed very small portion. Bland beans & rice, and very salty Chorizo, Service was friendly and fast. Nice in side. Did not see a Salsa bar."}
{"text":"Honestly, the service was lacking a little bit. Very kind and inviting, but I did have to request a fork and napkins. And although I was asked immediately if I was ready to order food, since I had never been here before I did need to look at the menu a few minutes. And then after that it was quite a while till he returned to take my order. But not a huge deal overall. And most importantly... The food was delicious. I ordered a Barbacoa taco and a Barbacoa tostada. They were both very good. The Dr Pepper/soft drink was also mixed appropriately and tasted great. The taco ended up being delicious. Primarily because when you order tacos at this place, you get to take your taco taco up to a topping bar where you have various sauces and plenty of toppings/produce to choose from. It really is an excellent way to offer tacos. Great atmosphere too. I would love to return here. Particularly for the taco bar."}
{"text":"Officially my new favorite taco spot in town! Having been to some of the other popular taco spots in Cleveland (like La Plaza) I can honestly say that this place now holds the #1 spot for me. They have plenty of variety with their tacos, everywhere from steak and chorizo to beef tongue and tripe! The tortillas are cooked to perfection, and there is a salad bar where you can pick from various toppings and house-made salsas to make your taco your own. The service is great, the restaurant decor is very welcoming, overall a great place that is relatively new to Cleveland and definitely deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"If you like Tex-mex, stay away. Ceviche anyone? Tripe? Their Al Pastor game may be the best in town. Muy, muy Bien!"}
{"text":"Wow what a awesome experience I ordered the carne Assada dinner everything was great steak tacos looked awesome there's a mini authentic taco bar too and the fried ice cream is just great I'm defidently gonna be a regular !!! 


Update carne Asada was dissatisfying and lacked the greatness it once was maybe a new chef. They need to serve chips and salsa and maybe upgrade menu"}
