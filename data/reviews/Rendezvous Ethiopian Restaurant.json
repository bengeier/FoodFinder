{"text":"It was a bit difficult to find due to construction, but once I entered the place - its charm grabbed me. I was the only one at the restaurant on an early Wednesday afternoon, so I got lot of attention. The lady was super nice and helpful. The menu is limited, but covers all needs from vegetarian to carnivore preference. I had their samplers and it was awesome. The simplicity, the homeyness, and not least the favors made me give the highest rating. I definitely plan a visit next time in Calgary."}
{"text":"Though Caucasian, I was born and raised in Ethiopia. I too purchased Groupon tickets as I had not heard of this restaurant before and I was skeptical. However, the food was delicious and authentic! The regular price is also good. The menu does not have a wide range and the place is small, but I go for the food and the company of people who also enjoy the cuisine. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"This lonely little resto in the outskirts of downtown near the old Telus Science Center is a bit of a gem.  A little eclectic yet sparse in decor, it's a quaint little place that seems to be run by a couple who were pretty friendly and accomodating.  Still, if it wasn't for a Groupon thing I picked up, I honestly wouldn't have known they even existed.  There really isn't much advertising anywhere so far as I can tell, and it's in a weird location near the former Telus Centre of Science, in pretty pedestrian quiet area as well.  Heck, if it was for the little street sign on the sidewalk, I honestly wouldn't have even noticed it under normal circumstances.  Should the owners read this, honestly, I'd look for some way to promote yourselves.  Now as I was saying about the decor, it's really as basic as it gets, with tables and chairs and not much else.  My dining companion and I went in one evening, and found us to be the only diners inside at the time.  Never a particularly good sign, I was still determined to see if this would be an interesting hidden gem or not.  The menu is a little sparse as Ethiopian places go. Virtually the entire menu is beef with a token offer of lamb or vegetarian, which is a bit of a surprise when considering that there is normally a pretty large vegetarian option for Ethiopian cuisine as a whole.  I was especially surprised to see no chicken, or any other protein for that matter.  Still, I decided to try the Rendezvous special, which is a mixed offering of the various beef dishes and the lentils.  Overall?  I would put it about in the middle.  Definately not one of the best ones I've had (Fassil) but neither is it anywhere near the worse (the now shuttered Queen of Sheba).  The spices were more or less what I expected, though my dining pal stated that she found the bread unusually more sour than other places.  I'd like to give this a much better rating, but it's a little difficult right now as I find the menu just too limited.  Still, it was a decent ethiopian meal and I probably would like to come back with another ethiopian food fan to see what their take is."}
