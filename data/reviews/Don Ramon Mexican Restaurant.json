{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I have tried . Lovely service , great ambience and the food is amazing. I recommend to stop in at lunch when they have specials and they don't cost much. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times. It is our go to mexican place. The food is great - get the fajita burrito! will not disappoint and more than enough to take home (Decent heat up in oven or microwave the next day). Margaritas are also delicious. Service is fast and friendly and attentive. My friend likes super spicy food and they have the sauces to please her."}
{"text":"Authentic delicious food. Yolanda was our server and was super. Definitely worth the trip! Will come back."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The pricing is fair but it's definitely not authentic. Great and friendly service tho!"}
{"text":"My kids say, \"Rice was tasty. Enchilada was the right amount of moist. Tacos had soggy meat.\" The staff were very accommodating and allowed changes and substitutions to menu. I enjoyed my made to order burrito. Chips and salsa were good. Beans were done right and tastey. My daughter and two helpings of rice. Good not great. No half price margaritas on weekends."}
{"text":"The tamales were great and the hot salsa had a nice kick but still good flavor. Service was friendly. Overall, solid Mexican..and of course by that I mean the food and service...I did not physically handle the staff."}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland/west lake on business, found this place on yelp.  Chips were hot and fresh. The hot salsa was very spicy (as expected) but tasted amazing. The enchiladas verdes  were very authentic. Everything was great.  Great food at a great price!!!"}
{"text":"SO and I came here thinking it was \"El Rodeo\" (from a google search for mexican food) and we found Don Ramon's. Let me say: our waitress (i believe her name was yolanda) was absolutely wonderful. So kind and courteous and attentive. I had the lunch special #17, which was a yummy steak burrito with awesome sides and such yummy chips and salsa. SO had Lunch Special (i think it was #15?) that was a pork/chorizo burrito, and he loved it. We also ordered a pitcher of beer, some iced tea, and a side of sour cream and the entire meal (that we couldnt finish there was so much) cost us around $30. We loved everything about this place, and we'll probably be getting some to go next time (planning a trip this week) so we can enjoy it staying in with a good movie. Love Don Ramon's. The service was great, the people were great. Im not sure why this would get any negative reviews."}
{"text":"Been here many times over the years and always liked it.
Last weeks visit was different. Ordered the #12 combination and the part of the food was frozen solid. After I sent it back and got a new (hot) dinner, the woman at the table next to us sent her plate back for the same reason.
 Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent sit down Mexican restaurant! Good prices, great food, delicious margaritas and super friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"One of the closest Mexican restaurants. In the area I have to say it's not bad, I always order the fajitas, One of my favorites and I love their chicken soup."}
{"text":"Went here tonight and had what appeared to be a drunk waiter. Ordered waters to start and waiter returned 30 seconds later to ask us what drinks we ordered. When he came back we placed our meal orders. 30 minutes later we ask where the food is to find out he never placed the order. Waiter was walking around without a clue as to what was going on. Had to ask for the check for the 1 billable item 3 times in a 3 minute span. Should probably make sure the staff stays off the sauce while working."}
{"text":"Half off drinks !! Mon-fri. 330-630  Happy hour its worth it! Food is good! !"}
{"text":"#18 Jalapeno Burrito is great for a \"run of the mill strip plaza Mexican joint\" (yes, that's a whole food genre).  Get the hot salsa with the chips; it's pretty tasty and has some good heat.  El cheapo Lunch Margarita does the trick.  Don't splurge and get the \"premium Texana margarita\" though, it still comes straight out of a jug."}
{"text":"We travel all over the country, this restaurant is by far one of the best Mexican restaurants we highly recommend it. Great food, Great service, Great price"}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Don Ramon in the past month.  Both times on Friday, the second was busy during dinner rush.  Promptly seated upon arrival and quickly delivered chips and salsa.  I had a Steak Burrito California which covered in a white cheese sauce.  It a filling meal which I proudly washed down with 3 adult beverages!  They do a great job here with the food and the staff is very friendly.  I look forward to returning again!"}
{"text":"OK...love the authentic americanized south of the border menu!  

Love the location.  Truly a beautiful place expertly designed.... clean and inviting....including the restrooms!

 Though the wait staff can be cool and aloof, seemingly annoyed by gringos endlessly yankee-fied questions regarding menu items.....insert faint ....almost missed eye roll when asked wtf is Nopal? with absolute exasperation, she answered... \"taste like-a green bean...\"  And yes...it does! I will seek out recipes.

 I digress. 

I tried to engage team \"#thought this was Beachwood\".
in my meal choices and was

seriously up for anything.... but I was left swinging in the wind....partially.  

We ordered the Chorizo
 cheese app and twice have blown thru open mouth-puffed out cheeks Montezuma Molcajete stone ground bowl of sinfully prepared....expertly prepared dish of prime rib chix, cactus and silky cheese. 

Great place, great neighborhood...tucked away in Warrensville Heights.

Nice addition.

Why don't they deliver or park a food truck out front of wherever I am?!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute,  clean Mexican restaurant where the people were very nice and the food was good. It is not unusual for me to get disappointed when I try a new Mexican restaurant because so many of them in this area have different names but what looks like the SAME MENU. Don Ramón had some of the same items as others, of course, but their menu did not look like they were following \"the formula.\"  The guacamole was buttery and flavorful and the chips were really delicious with great texture.  I ordered the tacos al carbón,  which could be ordered with chicken, steak, pork, chorizo or shrimp. They tasted very authentic, served with lime, pico de gallo, and a salsa verde that was distinctive and really added to the flavor of the tacos.  The rice and beans were good and not too salty. I hope people can appreciate that Don Ramón is a little outside the formula of many of the Mexican restaurants we have here. I will go back again when I am in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. They are consistent with their food. Service is incomparable. They prepare their dishes quickly. Prices are just right.  I don't agree with the negative reviews."}
{"text":"Decent and inexpensive but not fantastic.. still looking for an authentic mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice cold Dos Equis in large mugs!

A very friendly waiter. I asked for a recommendation and he suggested fajitas.  
Nice large sizzling platter full of chicken, peppers and onions. A side of lettuce, beans, cheese, pico de gallo, and sour cream and plenty of tortillas. 
My colleague got the shrimp and rice and he said it was quite good.. over a dozen nice plump shrimp.

I'd come back when I'm in the area again. 

Doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is clean and airy."}
{"text":"My kids and I really like this place. The food is good and the atmosphere is pleasant. The soups are really good and the chicken soup is loaded with vegetables. I would give don Ramon's 4.5 to 5 stars, especially since there are not a lot of great Mexican places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Friendly restaurant food was good,  Few hours later our stomach's were hurting bad. Probably went on a bad day. Be aware."}
{"text":"I have been going here for more than 6 years. The portions have been getting smaller and smaller. Tonight the service was the worst . I told the front of the house twice it was my daughter's 8th birthday and was ignored on a slow night. I will never go back and will never recommend this place again as I have in the past."}
{"text":"Ramon gave me food poisoning. The servers there was so many of them doing nothing all while one manger was running around doing all the work. Our server just left us and took us 15 mins to get the check. And when we got the check we were charged for 11$ patron margs when we just ordered regular ones"}
{"text":"Very fast service in a nice family restaurant..The Saturday margarita special hit the spot at $17 for a large pitcher.  They have a great homemade hot sauce and try the El Rancho Special. The waiter was nice and polite...EXCELLENT CHIPS AND SALSA!! The food came out, hot and tasty, in less than 5 minutes. I had to ask for more time..which is probably not even a reasonable complaint. Good place to meet a group of friends for drinks and still fam friendly at same time."}
{"text":"Favorite place for Mexican food on the westside!! Delicious tacos and all the ingredients are fresh!! Employees are very friendly! Service is great!! Highly recommend to anyone looking for awesome Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"We were going in the area and had a craving for Mexican. Yelp suggested Don Ramon and it didn't disappoint. Not too crowded so we got in quickly. Service was extremely friendly and not too pushy - we had time to look over the menu and decide without feeling pressured. 

The menu is pretty extensive, with a few vegetarian options and several kid menu options. My wife had a mushroom quesadilla, mine had chicken and cheese and the boy had a cheese version. All the food came out quickly, hot and well-presented. The rice wasn't the best but it was good. 

Frozen strawberry margarita was pretty good as well. And the beer was cold. Overall, a 3.5 star experience, bumped up for being a decent value. Worth coming back for."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland area, at this point.

The food is absolutely delicious... we hardly ever take leftovers home because the portion sizes are pretty much spot on. The hot salsa is so spicy, but it still has really good flavor - it's not just HOT blasting your mouth. 

I've tried things all across the menu and been happy with everything so far. The service is always very good, very fast, and attentive. We came with a group of 8 once, with specific dietary requests, and the service we had that evening was fantastic.

The price is reasonable, and there are coupons online, and in mailers, and so for all of those reasons, we'll keep coming back, again and again!"}
{"text":"I have tried a few Mexican restaurants in the area, and this one is my favorite. I have been there twice now and both times had good service. The food is sooo good. There is a burrito there called Noreno Burrito and it has pulled pork and chorizo in it, it is amazing. The salsa is really good, it tastes very fresh, and has pieces of cilantro in it, which I love. The ambiance is pretty typical Mexican restaurant, nothing special, but nice. The food is very good."}
{"text":"Friendly fast hot great place for lunch or dinner highly recommend only place we'll go for Mexican. Fiesta Burrito is awesome. 
Ask for the hot salsa & cheese dip w the chips."}
{"text":"The food has always been delicious and well-portioned, the staff friendly and helpful and quick, their cleanliness is excellent and their atmosphere a true fiesta. They are affordable, pleasant and I cannot speak well enough of them. In all the months I have been going they have never let me down. Viva Don Ramon!"}
{"text":"I love don ramon is the best Mexican restaurant on town  best Mexican restaurant on town food is delicious drinks great en very good price and service is very good and fast  margaritas and excellent service"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was good but the food was very average.  With so many Mexican restaurants on the west side I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"This is a nice Mexican restaurant with good food i usually get the special dinner which has a little bit of everything on the menu.Staff is friendly the restaurant is clean good value good happy hour with drink specials."}
{"text":"stopped in for lunch before dropping a friend at the cleveland airport and it was fantastic.  the food was very good and the price could not be beat. Lunch specials were super afftordable.  our server was hilarious and very friendly.

casual laid back environment."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and served at the right temperature.  Service was very quick.   A little hard to understand the server.  Margaritas were great.  Would certainly go back again."}
{"text":"The large frozen margaritas are incredible. They tasted great and had a nice kick to them. The food was hearty and tasted wonderful. The food was hot and served in a timely manner. The portions were big and priced fairly. The salsa and chips we had during the wait for our food were good. Salsa and chips are always a plus!!!

The service was ok, the server did not speak English well so ordering was a bit difficult. Other than that the place is good I would go back. All the positives definitely outweigh the one negative."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've found in Ohio! I'm from California and I eat really good Mexican food 3-4 times a week, and this is the very best I've found in Ohio! We're here 2-3 times a year and I always give my wife a hard time that we can't find really good Mexican food? Now we have our spot!"}
{"text":"Service was good and that's about it. Ground beef lacked seasoning and was so overworked it was pasty. Taco shells were par-baked and tasted like they pulled them out of the box but didn't put them under the broiler. We won't be back. Nothing authentic or good enough to warrant a return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat here every 1-2 weeks. The staff is great and the food never disappoints. I would continue coming here even if I didn't live nearby."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what all the bad reviews are about.  We come here at least twice a month because the food is phenomenal, the service is quick, and the margaritas will knock you on your @ss!  My favorite is the Fajita Quesadilla with Shrimp...a (very) generous helping of shrimp covered in white cheese, all wrapped in a quesadilla.  Does it get any better than that?  Yes, it does:  Half price Margaritas at Happy Hour (daily until 6:30)!  You might as well get the MONSTER because you'll end up ordering a second drink anyway.  Also, look for coupons in your local coupon magazine."}
{"text":"We arrived for lunch on a Friday afternoon. We ended up parking in the rear because of a sign saying additional parking in the rear. We noticed there was an entrance in the rear also. Upon entering a sign tells you you must walk all the way to the front of the restaurant to be seated. Awkward but not a big deal. We were seated quickly and drinks and chips and salsa came out immediately. The chips were average but they were not as greasy as other restaurants. The mild salsa was a little on the warm side but it was pretty bland. Not much in it. The hot salsa was pretty good but it is similar to the hot salsa as you get at many of the other Mexican restaurants. Our food order came out in about 10 minutes. Definitely one of the best fajitas that I have had from a Mexican restaurant in a long time. Barely any grease and the chicken was seasoned really well. The peppers, onions, and tomatoes were actually diced which was different but good. It cost about 2 dollars more than your average restaurant and the portion size was a little smaller. This restaurant is definitely one of the cleaner Mexican restaurants I have been to."}
{"text":"Best food! Staff is great! I'm very picky about Mexican food so the fact that I love this place is a big deal. I will continue going as long as I live up north."}
{"text":"Better than many other Mexican places I have tried. Being a vegetarian Mexican food always saves me from driving around to find something edible. It was by chance I found this place and it was good. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"This place is great! I recommend the fajita machines and a margarita! My kids loved everything they ordered. My husband got a California burrito and wiped his plate clean. We enjoyed flan and churro a w ice cream and chocolate sauce. Great service too! We loved the chips and salsa. Our waiter took great care of us. Food was hot and fresh. The kids drinks always full."}
{"text":"Food is very bland and they have roaches. I've been to quite of bit of Mexican restaurants and I honestly have to say this was not my favorite. I was expecting a great impact of flavor but that wasn't the case. The service was decent for the most part, but when we were sitting at the bar and saw a Roach crawl across the table I was completely disgusted. Sadly because of that I will never go back in that restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. Great sangria. Great friends. Buena comida. Gran sangría. Buenos amigos.  Muy bien"}
{"text":"Writing after two visits.
The food is generally good. I was little hesitant with the 4 stars but decided to go ahead with it.
First time we were in a group so I had chance to sample variety of food. Everything was spot on. The portions, the flavors and taste.  The home made tomatillo salsa is amazing. It is so hot that it is good. Without burning my taste buds.
The second time though, the food was salty.  The beans the fajitas as well as the rice.  Of course saltiness depends on the individual palate but I found it a heavy on salt.
The service is good. People are friendly, serve with a smile.  Prompt.
The place is huge.  Lots of booth and table seating.
Ask for their tomatillo salsa!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, chips solid, salsa could be better but was good, chorizo cheese sauce was amazing, beef tacos and 1 chicken were solid."}
{"text":"Dinner with the family. Place was supper packed but we were seated within 5 min. Waitress was quick to serve and awesome. Food was delicious!! Atmosphere was great. They have a bar were you can mingle, chat and have a cold one. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Was impressed with the number of people in the restaurant. Homemade chips and salsa were great. Salsa had the perfect kick to it, not just bland tomatoes and onions. 

Had the Molcajete.  Came out in a stone bowl that must have just been used to melt iron ore. After 20 minutes, the sauces in the bowl were still bubbling. The dish contained steak, chicken, chorizo, shrimp, peppers, onions and some kind of sauce with cheese sprinkled on top. Once it cooked down enough to eat, it was excellent!  

Daughter had Veggie #1, bean burrito and cheese enchilada. Very yummy she reports. 

Margarita was good, but nothing to write about."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant around here. We come here at least once a week. Incredible margaritas, food, and the staff is amazing. Love this place."}
{"text":"This place is great. Very large and plenty of seating. The environment was nice nothing fancy just casual but it was not loud or too noisy for a Saturday night. I ordered the burrito California and my boyfriend ordered the chorizo pollo and both meals were very delicious. We were served promptly and the waitress and servers were friendly and very efficient. I definitely want to go there again. Honestly I want to try everything on that menu. The chorizo pollo reminded me of the kind my mom makes out in Santa Ana,CA. This place is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"My experience at Don Ramon was a bit underwhelming. The experience wasn't necessarily bad. We got our food in a decent amount of time and water was kept full. The food was decent, just nothing spectacular. Basically, next time I want Mexican, I'd likely try to go somewhere else, butDon Ramon wouldn't be completely Thrown out"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is what is to be expected of a suburban Mexican restaurant, though we found the food to be quite good,  the service was excellent,  and it was a good value. Chips were warm and thin, salsa wad delicious and obviously freshly made since our 2nd bowl of salsa tasted different than the first - but both good. There are 3 other Mexican restaurants closer to our home, but I'll drive a few extra miles as this is my new favorite."}
{"text":"Had a carryout lunch here for the first time today with coworkers.  It is ok...nothing special.  Had lunch #10 with whole pinto beans instead of refried as I always do when enjoying Mexican cuisine.  The beans were blah...did not taste like there was any seasoning.  Enchilada was ok.  My coworkers that had the rice said it was extremely salty.  They included tortilla chips and 1, itty bitty container of salsa for 4 take out lunches.  Price was cheap so it has that going for it but would dine at the other Mexican establishment less than a mile east of this one before I would go back here.  Quality was just so-so."}
{"text":"best frozen strawberry margarita I have ever had. The food is ok nothing great. but the endless free chips and good salsa make up for it. and Yolanda is amazing."}
{"text":"\"meh\" is about the gist of it. it wasn't bad but it wasn't anything i need to have again.

we went to a movie in Brooklyn and then were looking for some dinner. normally, we'd just go over to Texas Roadhouse but we'd just been there last week or so. Danielle mentioned Don Ramon was open and we agreed to go.

initially, i thought things were gonna go better than the normal Mexican food outing. the place looks nice inside and is quite large w/ lots of tables. we looked over the menu and made our selections. for me, as usual, were chimichangas. Danielle had the #16 combo (tamale, burrito and enchilada). she said the food was ok but by the time she got to the burrito she wouldn't eat it because \"it is all mushy\". my food was fine - basically what i've come to expect of Mexican restaurants in our area - bland but inoffensive. my chimichangas were fried but barely. the chicken filling was nothing special. the guacamole was good but i wish Mexican places would give you the option of \"no cilantro\". so many people don't like it you think they'd prep the stuff without it and let the customer decide when placing the order if they want it. 

probably not going back. no offense, it just wasn't good enough to drive that far."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place.  If someone asks where to eat Mexican ANYWHERE in Cleveland I recommend Don Ramon.  The service is always outstanding, the food is always amazing and the prices are more competitive than any other place in the area.  Chips and salsa are always being refilled and you can tell they just came out of the fryer.  Don't waste your time trying to take a chance with any of the other local Mexican joints, as we have not found any that are even close to our experience with Don Ramon over the years."}
{"text":"DO NOT go to Don Ramon's in Parma Heights.  They have watered down minus tequila Margaritas. We have gone to this location sine 2012. And these are the worst. Then I asked for a credit for the pitcher. And was not compensated!!!! The pitcher was $24.00 for green limanade !"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and husband on a weeknight.  There weren't a lot of people there.  Which had me worried. 

The food was just so so for me.  I think I was expecting better but what I got was sub par tex mex.  I got the La Favorita.  The meat was over cooked and dry.  Same with the rice.

My husband said that the chimichangas were better but that the tamales were just as dry too.  So in the end, the food here was not bad but I definitely won't be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Never, ever again.  First, I order a frozen margarita.  It comes out on the rocks.  Then I order an enchilada and a burrito.  I actually asked my date if they could tell which is which because they both looked like enchiladas to me...  Needless to say, neither were tasty and I ended up just eating my rice.  The server asked twice if I wanted a box and I said I was done.  At that point, typically servers ask if the meal was alright.  She didn't.  I pay at the register and the cashier asks how the meal was and I say, \"Not good. I didn't like the food and she gave me the wrong type of margarita.\"  He didn't respond.  I wasn't expecting my meal for free or anything but a simple, \"I'm sorry to hear it\" would've been nice."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times as was always best priced food.  Service is iffy at times, often our server also works the cash register so you have to look in direction and hope for eye contact when we need something.  Food is GOOD!  Prices just went up on menu, some significantly, usual family meal was $10 more than last time we went, but we will be back just not as frequently."}
{"text":"We used to like El Rodeo.  When it changed to Don Ramon it seems like the prices went up and the quality of the food went way down.  It's almost always empty.  I'm not sure how they stay in business."}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon my wfie, son, and I enjoyed very attentive serivce and good standard Mexican food.  The frozen margarita was tasty, appetizers arrived quickly, drinks were re-filled before we ran out, and the entrees were good also.  Cost was reasonable"}
{"text":"Typical strip mall Mexican restaurant, with a funky and fun decor.

The food was all fresh and delicious, especially the enchiladas rancheras, with a smoky red rancheras sauce that continues to haunt my dreams (at least until my next visit).

They have great specials at lunch and dinner, and money saving coupons can be found on their website.

Is it the best Mexican I've had?  No.  But it is reliably good, and the staff has always been attentive and gracious.

I will continue to return to this fun little gem."}
{"text":"Really pains me to give this place such a low rating because I came back here to give this place another try after having had a bad experience once before with their food. This time the food was some of the best Mexican food I've had in quite a while, but the service was absolutely unacceptable.
If I had to rate this restaurant on the food alone, then it'd get a four star rating, but when it came to ambiance, it gets a negative five star rating, so I'm balancing it out to an overall rating of a one star.
I have NEVER felt so unwelcome in a restaurant in my life. Our waiter was completely uninterested in his job, us, or being here. We saw him three times, when he HAD to take our order, when he HAD to get me a refill on my drink (which is when I had to find him and flag him down) and when he HAD to give us our bill. I'm not kidding about this, he never stopped by our table to ask us how our food was; he never stopped by to ask us if we needed refills on our drinks, and worse yet, we had to get up, get our coats and scarves on and walk towards the door in order to get him to give us our bill.
Such a shame, because I really enjoyed their food, but I an guarantee you, if you're going to treat me like you are so uninterested in me and my hard earned money, then I am NOT going to spend in your restaurant, no matter how good your food is, because in my opinion, half the experience is how you're treated."}
{"text":"Awesome scrumptious food! The employees are so warm -- it makes getting a dinner so enjoyable. Also, I have to send an item back and our waiter was so receptive and made everything satisfactory without delay!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local place, hands down. Great employees, excellent food, and unbeatable prices. My fav dish is he shrimp fajita nachos, but you cant go wrong with any dish."}
{"text":"This is my go to for Mexican. I go here with my mom and my girlfriends often. It's even one my kids enjoy going to. Yolanda is such a great server and always takes great care of us. Enrique is running an excellent establishment which consistently provides a great meal and dining experience."}
{"text":"I walked in here to get out of the rain and I was so happy I did. Live mariachi band! Kind and fast service. Great prices! I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Horrible, not good at all. I will not be back. I guess I was SPOILED by LOS GALLOS in Bedford. I have YET to find anywhere that even comes CLOSE."}
{"text":"When we were seated there was a strange stench in the booth...still not sure what it was..
The service was ok, but the food was meh...The quesadilla had barely any cheese, and my friend who ordered a fajita quesadilla, which is almost double the cost, got essentially the same thing for double the cost....They were very stingy on cheese in general and the guac was not fresh...would not be back."}
{"text":"Well above average.  Large selection.  Atomosphere.  Superior housekeeping is obvious."}
{"text":"Sooooo obsessed with this place! My fiancé and I drive from Akron just to eat here. He always gets the lobster burrito and I always get el Potisino. It's fantastic. I am drooling just typing this. Only go to this Mexican restaurant if you are in the area. Fantastic! I can't remember the waitress we usually have (hard to believe I know) but she is great. The guys are great too. Always nice. :)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our favorite Mexican restaurant is slipping a bit.  We had lunch there last week and the food came on a noticeably smaller plate.  Everything still tasted good.  However, for the past several times have gotten the same waiter with poor English.  We can hardly understand him and he can hardly understand us.  However, he was persistent in pushing margaritas.  We kept telling him we were only SHARING one as we had to go back to work, but he still asked us four or five more times if we wanted another margarita to the point that we were annoyed."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for a Mexican restaurant. It's hidden off pearl road so location wise it's not good. Atmosphere is typical Tex mex, the salsa is eh, the queso is eh. I had a shrimp taco skillet, it came out a bit cooler than I would have liked. My husband had steak fajitas and agreed they were on the cool side. The waiter was attentive, and was on the ball refilling chips and drinks. Good children's menu, my toddler is a picky eater but enjoyed their quesadillas. It's close to my house so it works for me, but if I was really craving Mexican I would probably take my taste buds elsewhere."}
{"text":"From Texas, working near by. Found this place via yelp. It was amazing. Very hard to find anything half this good this far from home. The service, food and atmosphere is great. Will try to come again before we leave town."}
{"text":"I had the fajatias, safe bet. Here is where they differ and why I will go back. The food was excellant, fast and the waitress was a doll. Not the two typical tortialas like you get in Memphis, but that tin foil wrapper had 5 fresh, soft, tortialas inside. Didnt have to ask for more or wait. I know this is a minor thing, but it impressed me. I highly recomend giving this place a try, much better than bar food, and the cervasa is big and cold."}
{"text":"The food is great no matter what you get and they are super fast. Almost like they know what you are going to order before you do."}
{"text":"The service is so fast but never like fast food always happy to please and they help me practice my Spanish by the way the arroz con canaries is as amazing as it sounds but you need a tall xx to finish it love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Don Ramon's, I was a little bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews and pulling in the parking lot on a Saturday afternoon and there weren't very many cars.   I decided to go for it and boy am I glad that I did.   There were more people in the restaurant than I thought, and I was warmly greeted and seated right away.   The menu is pretty large and prices are very reasonable.  My server took my drink order.  I ordered a 12 ounce margarita, which was the smallest, but still very generous and very tasty!   The server also delivered a complimentary basket of warm tortilla chips and a side of moderately spicy salsa (very good!).    I ordered the chicken fajita entree ($13.95), which arrived in less than 10 minutes and served hot and sizzling on a cast iron skillet.   The serving was huge, enough for 2 people to share.   A side of rice, refried beans (topped with melted cheese), guacamole salad (lettuce layered with, guac, pico de gallo and sour cream, and warm tortillas.   Everything was fresh and delicious!   I will definitely return.....soon!"}
{"text":"Every time I have gone to this restaurant, I've gotten amazing service and even better food.
The staff was very fast and nice.
It's a good price for amazing food 
Will be going back !"}
{"text":"Really awesome service and staff. Look I know Mexican food. They need to use real cheddar cheese in the enchiladas. Many of the mexican restaurants here including this place use a valveeta type cheese which no authentic mexican restaurant would ever use. The rice and beans are pretty good. I hope they get it right. Real nice place and people. Great service."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mexican Restaurant in Cleveland. Every single dish I've ordered is mind-blowing-ly good. My favorites include the Nachos with chorizo and several other meats, the burrito norteno, and the burrito California. The complementary chips and salsa are probably the best I've had (still there are variations between the salsa batches). Let's not forget about the portions... HUGE and very inexpensive. If you go for the margaritas, they are large, they are inexpensive and they have all the kick you want in them. 

The staff is helpful,  very sweet and interested in making sure you have a good time. Still, if you go during a particulary slow time, you may have to witness them chatting or wrapping napkins/silverware nearby. Still, they try to keep it down, and if this bothers you I'm sure they can arrange to do that stuff later, because I have to emphasize they are really awesome people."}
{"text":"Have only been for lunch really but the lunch specials menu has a lot of variety and decent value.  The food has always been about what I'd expect, the staff is very good about substitutions and custom dishes, and the service has always been above average which bumps it up to a 4 star experience."}
{"text":"This is a smaller family owned type of Mexican restaurant.  The inside appears clean and decor quaint.  Most booth seating with some tables to accommodate larger groups.  My wise and I were remembering the \"molcajete\" lunches we have eaten in Acapulco and I found this place on Yelp.   The staff were friendly and service quick and attentive.  The salsa is the puree'd tomato type fairly mild but grew on us as we kept on dipping.  We ordered the churry cheese appetizer which was a hit.  Everyone enjoyed their entree.   I was the only one to get the molcajete.  It was not like I expected.  It was if everything was cooked and mixed together prior to putting it it the hot stone.   Nevertheless it was a tasty amalgam of cheese, chorizo, meat and small strips of probably canned nopales.   It's a nice enough place with good food and service. Just not a hit out of the ballpark.  As my wife said a one an done, since it was 25 minute drive to get there."}
{"text":"Decided on Don Ramon because of Yelp reviews. Big picture opinion...  Meh. 

Chips and salsa were good. Everything else was just ok. 

Will be searching for alternatives when the next hankering for Mexican creeps in..."}
{"text":"Salsa and chips some of the best I have ever had. We shared the chicken chimichangas they were great especially with the queso sauce all over it. The refried beans on the plate were the best I have ever tasted. We then indulged in sharing the fried ice cream it was again the best I have ever had. Hugely recommend this place it was packed but we were seated very quickly if we lived around here we would be regulars."}
{"text":"Don Ramon serves a necessary spot in the dining scene for Mexican food in that it's appealing to a wide audience. Basic Americanized Mexican food (not a slam, just my observation) served in a pleasant, clean location off Richmond Road in Warrensville Heights. The restaurant is clean, and the service is incredibly fast and friendly. There are more authentic Tex Mex style places in the area, but if you're looking for more mainstream, good quality, and reasonably priced food, this is the place. I highly recommend the chicken soup. It's made by the bowl by pouring delicious, hot broth over fresh vegetables (avacado, carrot, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini ). Fresh pulled chicken breast will be swimming in the broth for you to enjoy. Killer soup indeed. Try it sometime and let me know what you think.

Request a few lime wedges to squeeze into the soup. Equally flavorful as many Pho places I've tried."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good Mexican restaurant.   It was busy when we arrived but cleated out by 8 on a cold weekday evening.   Service was prompt, fair, not pushy.  How they can come up with pages of menu using a small amount of items is amazing.  Food came promptly and was hot in temperature. Everyone liked their meal.  I would have preferred the chips come with regular and hot salsa or that there was hot sauce on the table for both salsa and the meal.  I mean it is a Mexican place so hot and spicy is expected.  We went there because a few were in the mood for Mexican.  It satisfied their craving.  Price was okay. A decent size meal for $9.  Some dinners seemed too expensive so we didn't order those.  I think $14 for chicken fajita is too much.   The crew will go back and it is worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is usually fairly quiet and somewhat empty, which is really nice. The service is always very attentive. The food is good and the portions are huge for the price. Despite it's depressing exterior and location, the inside is very nice, clean, and well maintained. There are plenty of vegetarian options and they are almost always willing to make substitutions to non vegetarian items to make them veggie friendly."}
{"text":"I went back to Ohio from New York the other day craving some good Mexican grub.  The taquerias in NYC are good, but they don't do Mexican like Ohio does Mexican. 

Don Ramons didn't disappoint.  It's fabulous hot shredded chicken covered in gooey cheese, cold lettuce, and sour cream.  The Margarita was glowing like a neon sign filled with flavoring deliciousness.  I don't know what it is, but it's called \"Margarita mix\" and it comes in a jug.  The meal was even better sliding down my throat with some Chori-Cheese.  That White American spiced up cheese that all great Ohio Mexican restaurants serve is commonly known in my family as \"crack dip.\"  Don Ramons takes it to another level by adding Chrorizo to the already cracked out dip for a proper late night intestinal tickler.  

Hallelujah."}
{"text":"Overpriced BS. Combo platters for some beans and rice are way more expensive than what they should be. Just leave this page right now, and go to Cozumel or something. Don't bother with this place. Overpriced, and small portion for mediocre food served by an idiot. If that is the thing you like then hey, by all means have at it. 

I'll give them 2 stars for using flank steak. The burrito was small as hell, and the chips and salsa were fine but dude seriously the portion of salsa given to me (to go) was about the equivalent to two of them small paper cups fast food restaurants give you. The chip can't even dip in it because the thing was so small. 9 bucks for this pathetic burrito. I'd rather hit up taco bell and get triple the amount of food for that price. I don't mind quality over quantity but this place is a joke portion wise. The food was tasty, but for almost ten dollars I would expect a bit more. Oh, and I just remembered the guacamole that I paid extra for was turning. Still good enough to eat, but if I pay extra I expect it to be fresh. Do yourself a favor and skip this place and go get some food at the double dragon buffet right next door."}
{"text":"Hola mi amigos! I finally had a chance to try this place upon the recommendation of a life long friend. She raved to me about this place for over a year, so when I hit up the Cleveland scene this week, I decided it was time to take the famn damily (switch the letters up for the adultish version) and sit my half Puerto Rican behind down and eat! Don't try too hard to figure out how only half my butt is Puerto Rican....it'll scare you.

Let me start out by saying that the parking in the plaza is an absolute nightmare in the front lot. Make sure to drive in the back and park there if you actually don't want to feel like a hamster on a wheel looking for a spot. They are located on a corner space next to the bank, so head behind near the bank.

Walking in we were promptly greeted by a friendly staff who was eager to seat us. In the Mexican restaurant fashion, we were immediately brought glasses of water, chips and salsa. Lemme tell you folks, I L-O-V-E-D their salsa. LOVE. Did, I mention LOVE? The flavor was absolutely fantastic and oh so fresh. I actually ordered a bowl to eat without chips. That is just how good it was. The chips were fresh and warm as well. A great way to start out my meal.

Our waitress was direct and to the point. No frills with her, but that is ok. I do not need a smooth talking server...just one who feeds my face and fills my drinks! We ordered the fully loaded nachos with chicken. WARNING: THIS THING IS ABSOLUTELY GINORMOUS! Loaded with tons of cheeses, perfectly cooked chicken, sour cream and guacamole. Dynamo!

We ordered a few tacos, some rice and some beans and split those. Thank goodness we did, because the nachos were big enough! The tacos were flavorful, had fresh ingredients and were nicely portioned. The rice was run of the mill, nothing to write home to your Abuela about. The beans, on the other hand, were cooked perfectly and the flavor was spot on.

I am very glad to have stopped in after all this time to give this place a try. WOOT WOOT! A definite winner. We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Many people I worked with raved about this place...so I tried it.

For me just average and not a place I would frequent again.  It did not seem that anything was fresh...ie guac, salsa, tortillas, or chips.

If you want average, try it."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Mexican food for a great price! Service is quick and friendly all of the times I have been. The drinks come in huge glasses with free refills. I usually order a combination with a burrito and taco, but the burrito special is also a good choice. Warning: their burritos are huge! If you're looking for something quick, inexpensive, and tasty, I recommend it!"}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food I've ever eaten.  And their special margaritas made with top shelf tequila (at $10+ each) were made with mix, not fresh lime juice.  Needless to say they were horrible.  I can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fast Friendly Service....one of my favorite Mexican places. Food is awesome, I recommend the Taco Loco, Burrito Norteña or the Chorizo Pollo"}
{"text":"Now, as I've mentioned before, Mexican food is not a highlight of the Cleveland food scene. Don Ramon is no exception to that. Quite frankly the food is not much better than edible. For some odd reason I have dined here more than once and found their food to be relatively tasteless and while not necessarily bad, definitely an insult to Mexican cuisine.

My biggest complaint is the cheese sauce that adorns pretty much any dish. It tastes kind of like Cheese Whiz (in fact, it may be) and is poured on top of just about everything. I figure that it is likely to hide the lack of taste in the rest of the food. 

I also have a problem with Mexican restaurants other than Taco Bell that use ground beef in their menu items. If it says \"beef\", I expect steak or something of the like. Also, taco seasoning is a sin. If you use it, you can't call it Mexican food. It's just food with Taco Seasoning. 

I am generally forgiving of bad American Mexican restaurants if they are cheap but most items on the menu are overpriced and not as large as I would expect for the cost. 

I do have to say that the waiter are fairly friendly though not all that attentive. 

I would skip this one if I were you. But, if you are looking for Mexican food in Parma, there aren't too many other options. El Rodeo over this place any day though if you don't mind driving a few miles south."}
{"text":"This at one time was my favorite Mexican Restaurant in the area. The quality has suffered over the last few months. The original wait staff have mostly left. They used to have great salsa, now you have to hunt for a piece of onion or celantro. Left disappointed today, not sure that the 8 dollars off coupon was even enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"This Resturant is very reminiscent of Los Habeneros in Shaker Heights if you've ever been there. The food is authentically Mexican, and is very good. It is always hot and fresh, service is quick. Staff is welcoming, and friendly. Decor is nice; wonderful murals, Mexican style music. Complementary tortilla chips with salsa is a plus. Overall very nice place to try."}
{"text":"Very good experience. Went there with a large party, and the staff, especially the waitress were great.  I ordered a veggie fajita. I tasted very delicious. Was cooked very well. I never had a fajita ever before. Yes, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very good food. Portions are a little small but that's okay. Margaritas are delicious too! Will be back again."}
{"text":"Cute place in a horrid location. Wifey was hungry after thrifting (her favorite sport) so out came the Yelp app and found this place. Figured why not? What is a restaurant's worst nightmare, we have been to that plaza several times and never noticed this place before.

Standard chips and mild salsa complimentary. Nothing special.

Wifey got the burrito ranchero ($11) while I have to try the enchiladas potosi ($11). I had to try it because not only was it something I have never heard of, it has nopales. Food came quickly, and hot. She loved hers, and mine was pretty good - tart in the right way. Where the heck is the hot sauce? Why is it not on the table? WTF!?!?

Waiter was attentive mostly, but there was a definite language barrier. I am fluent in Spanish but I tend not to let on to that so I can listen in on the staff's conversations. Call me weird like that.

Place is gigantic and spotless. Why not give it a higher rating? Because it is just ok Mexican food. This city has food trucks with better stuff."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Chips and salsa were good, queso was outstanding. Chipotle cream sauce on cheese and onion enchilada, WOW! Pull chicken taco and beef tacos are not like ordinary Mexican places. These have flavor. Very good and we will go back."}
{"text":"I was here for a work-related happy hour, so I didn't really taste much of the food. However, the chips and salsa were really good (good cilantro flavor). Also, less than $4 during happy hour for two Coronas! The atmosphere is good, and my fellow colleagues all love the place. One of these days I'll have to have a real dinner here."}
{"text":"Been going here for as long as they have been open.  Great food, great prices, great service.  Any negative feedback has to have come from their competition.  Great place."}
{"text":"As we are driving the family cross country, we stopped in Westlake, OH for the night... we were tired and in search of a non-fast food dinner option.  We settled on Don Ramon, which ended up being a solid choice.  The chips and salsa came out, and I was really impressed with how crispy the chips were - I mean, super crispy.  The salsa didn't look impressive, but it tasted pretty darn good... we even asked for a second bowl.  My husband asked for hot sauce with his food, and they brought out an amaaaazing bowl of super spicy salsa/picante - not sure if it was homemade, but it was delicious.

All kids' meals are $3.99, and they include a drink... such a great deal, and my sons couldn't finish their plates.  The husband and I shared the Fajitas Texanas, which was a mixed grill platter of steak, chicken and shrimp.  It was HUGE!!  We could barely make a dent in it - I really think four people could share it.  The steak and chicken were just ok, but the shrimp was tasty.  Service was very friendly and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Thursday night.  Place was not busy whatsoever, which was quite apparent given the large space the restaurant occupies.

Food was okay, but not as good as I've had elsewhere.  Salsa has a very tomato-y flavor, guac was good.  The chimichangas were very cheesy, and did not come with another sauce (typical at other restaurants).  I had to add some salsa to cut down on the cheese factor.  Pork and chicken inside the chimichangas were good and not overcooked.

Service was fine...but my one complaint is that I could swear that the amount on my bill and the amount I was charged were not the same.  Thought my bill was $2 cheaper than what was on the receipt.  I'll allow for the fact that I misread the bill, but I'm not sure that I did.

There are better Mexican options in the area, so I'll not be back."}
{"text":"Great food, good portions, friendly service. Updated decor. Their menu has everything and they are really great about substitutions. I love the nachos, fajitas and quesadillas. They serve this really unique dish in a lava bowl that is delish!! Not same as grand fiesta exactly, same owner and menu but grand fiesta isn't as good and it's a different location.  I totally love Don Ramon and recommend it :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in the area.  Chips and salsa are always fresh and great.  The queso is also fantastic.  I've never had an experience here that has been less than great."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated and super clean (thanks to recently opening), Don Ramon's has pretty standard Mexican fare. I especially enjoyed that the complimentary chips were hot and the salsa was spicy and flecked with fresh cilantro. The menu was pretty hefty, which made choosing a meal somewhat challenging. I ordered the chicken soup, which is my default at Mexican restaurants when I'm overwhelmed. It was a decent version, however it was spiced mildly for my taste. The soup benefitted from adding in salsa, but that shouldn't be necessary for it to be enjoyable. I probably wouldn't order the soup again, but I would return to try some of their other dishes. The lobster fajitas sounded especially intriguing. 

I went with my dad on Father's Day and really liked that they were giving $10 gift certificates to all fathers that visited the restaurant that day...nice touch."}
{"text":"Was visiting my family in Cleveland and my mom chose this spot for dinner on a Tuesday evening. There were probably only 2 other parties in the restaurant so our waitress came over quickly and was super attentive the entire time even though we were sitting outside. We got the chips and salsa right away which were good but I like my salsa a little spicier. We were waiting for other people to join us and the staff was  more than accommodating to us ordering at different times. 

I got the chorizo and pork burrito with fresh jalepenos and it was perfect! So spicy and a HUGE portion. No sides of beans or rice necessary because there was a layer of it inside the burrito. My mom got the steak and avocado burrito and she also enjoyed it. Everything was very fresh tasting, hot and reasonably priced. We definitely had leftovers for lunch the next day. 

The one con I had about this restaurant is the location, its right in the middle of a residential area and I can't imagine what it would be like on a Friday or Saturday night with large crowds and lots of drinking going on. Overall, check out if you're on the east side of Cleveland and you probably won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Being from Texas where you get the best Mexican food anywhere, this place was very close! I had a clue when they brought a really fresh and authentic salsa. Very good. Had the cheese enchiladas with beans and rice. Everything was excellent! And I consider myself an expert when it comes to Mexican food."}
{"text":"while it is not inovative cooking in any way, it is nonetheless very good. standard issue mexican dishes are prepared just as they should be. I had one of the very best carnitas that I have ever had (and I have had A LOT!) The lovely Mrs had a spicy chicken dish, I forget which one, that she also liked a lot. BTW - their spicy salsa, not the one that they initially serve you, is very tasty with a little smokiness to it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Mexican Food Done Right!

I have been going to Don Ramons for years and have logged dozens of visits. They are one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.

The place has plenty of seating and the waitstaff is nice and friendly.  The salsa is fresh and flavorful. Combine that with crisp chips - Awesome! Their cheese sauce is excellent and food is served at perfect temperatures and arrive quickly.  Their margaritas are strong - and 1/2 price for happy hour.

al probar se ve el mosto."}
{"text":"I love this place!! In fact, I think I frequent this establishment a little TOO much. Everything I have tried is good, The service is fast too. I have tried other Mexican restaurants in the area, NONE are as good. I ADORE the salsa there. I get chips/salsa to go pretty often too."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant around! Staff is always friendly and quick. The chimichangas are amazing, too."}
{"text":"I'd been here before, a few years ago and it was always ok.
Giiiiirl...
They stepped their game UP!! They redecorated and revamped the menu.
When I went today they were having a bunch of spinach specials. 
We ordered the spinach cheese dip, the spinach enchiladas, and the spinach quesadilla.
That spinach dip? It is by far the best I've ever had. With diced tomatoes and onions.....
Giiiiiiiirl......
It's really easy to over cook spinach and make it a slimy disgusting mess. It's also easy to have it too watery and have it water down the dish. None of that happened here. Perfect!
The salsa was spicy and on point.
Marisol our server  was helpful and attentive.
Oh and check out the bathroom sinks!!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican cuisine, great drinks! This gem is hidden in Savannah Plaza on Detroit in Westlake- if you aren't looking for it you may miss it all together. The restaurant is much bigger than it looks so there is hardly ever a wait. Great for family and friend get togethers!"}
{"text":"Similar feel to many of the other mexican restaurants in the area. Same food and decor, but i like the food a lot and they make them well. I have had no problems from Don Ramon's and plan on going back again sometime."}
{"text":"I actually would not have reviewed the lunch at all - but felt I had to considering, I became really sick just a few moments after leaving. And I mean - really sick - and I had felt fine before eating. Aside from the food, sadly, everything else was top notch: friendly service, great atmosphere, good prices - I think I was just in the running for an unlucky plate this time.  I have several hotspots in Canton I will stick to, however, for the time being."}
{"text":"I cam here for lunch with a co worker.  They had a long lunch specials menu as well as a regular menu. I ordered the 17. The cheese covered burrito was amazing. The white queso was delicious and all the stuffing made the tender steak even better. I would recommend this to someone looking for a quick delicious lunch."}
{"text":"This was a good experience all around. The Decor is bright and fun and the restaurant is surprisingly large for being a storefront. We went at dinner on Friday and despite being busy we didn't have to wait. We sat by the bar and were greeted quickly with chips and salsa and and drinks were ordered and delivered. I got the Burritos Ranchero for dinner and my girlfriend got the Carnitas. Despite the food taking a little while(busy Friday) it was delivered hot and everything was delicious! I highly recommend both dishes. They gave us so many jalapeños with the Carnitas and the ranchero sauce was awesome!"}
{"text":"For some reason my wife doesn't like them and prefers las caz but me and my kids love DR. Can't say I've ever had bad service or anything that wasn't as expected.  

My mouth is watering and we are going out for Mexican tonight . Unfortunately my wife is coming so....might have to drop her ass off at Las Caz, caz I'm eating at DR!!!"}
{"text":"Always friendly service. Amazing cheese dip with warm tortilla chips. Fajitas are never greasy. Been going here for years and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant around, I've been coming here since I was a kid. The service is excellent and kind, my food is always prompt and perfect. Can't go here without ordering their queso, it is inherently better than any other queso you will try. They're a true gem."}
{"text":"I love when reviewers get all territorial with reviews. \"I had sushi in Los Angeles once and to eat it anywhere else is an abomination to all that is holy with Japanese cuisine.\" Like...really? You know that we've had the interstate travel system for about 75 years now? Enabling people of all cultures and ethnicities to live wherever they damn please? Which means even white-bred Cleveland pasties like myself have access to great Mexican fare, like at this place? Want me to stop asking questions now?

Anyway, this place in a random-ass Parma Heights strip mall is really a solid Mexican restaurant with a friendly wait-staff and a nice family ambiance. I would definitely come here again. The enchilada and burrito combo I had was delicious, and call me a Midwesterner, but I would put that hellaciously tasty cheese sauce in my coffee every morning if I wasn't concerned at all about my health."}
{"text":"Hello Amigos! Always a good experience and the food comes out super fast. Enrique and his staff provide great service and we have never been disappointed. There are a lot of great items on the menu but the carnitas are the best. Also - margaritas are not watered down like the other Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of the top Mexican restaurants in Cleveland. 
Quick service. Food is priced perfectly. Fresh ingredients. Will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Our go-to Mexican place for about 5 years now. Fast service, great frozen margaritas, good food and kid-friendly. The staff is so friendly and accommodating, we compare all other Mexican restaurants to this place and none come even close to Don Ramon. It's also very clean. So happy this place is close to home!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here in October :) I had a pina colada (virgin), 2 avocado salads and a California burrito which was huge! I could only eat half. I'm not a big fan of Mexican food but this place always has coupons in the mail. The salad was fresh and I loved that the guacamole had no salt in it :)"}
{"text":"I only gave  1 star here ONLY because I had to.  Bad food/ stomach ache all night / horrid service- the worst part ; horidly overcharged for what they called ' extras \" 
-----. I was charged $60 .00 for  8 choriso tacos.  $15 .00 of that was \" extra \"  because I asked them to substatute the lettuce & tomato , for cilantro & onion. They said it would be extra....WOW!  This is  like theft. I never heard of a place charging 15 $ for  cilantro & onion."}
{"text":"The salsa and hot chips are flavorful, especially the hot salsa, which my wife calls, \"so painfully good!\"

The chorizo pollo was fantastic - I wrapped it up in a tortilla with beans, rice, and some of the salsa, and I was in spicy heaven.

I reluctantly put down my rapid tortilla assembly machine (fork) when my wife suggested I save the rest for lunch tomorrow.  Future me will thank me, but Present me hates him just a little right now.

Good prices, good atmosphere, attentive and very friendly waiter... couldn't be better."}
{"text":"I looooooooooooooooooooved eating here! I am a loyal Plaza Agave patron, but I went here to celebrate my sister passing her medical board examinations (woohoo!). I had margaritas and got to try various different food plates. I can't believe how low cost this place was despite all the great things about it. So if you were curious, here is a list of everything I loved about Don Ramon:

Table sizes/spacing
Friendly server
Large portion sizes
Variety of menu options
Great margaritas, frozen or not
Complimentary salsa and chips
Affordable!!
Fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Always amazing food. We have 2 Hispanic restaurants that we pass by within 1 mile of our house, we choose to drive 3 more miles to get a great meal, great service, great portions, great prices!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure why I'm giving this place only three stars, but I cannot think of a reason to go much higher. The food was good - tasty and served fairly quick. The staff was ok - not the friendliest, but I've had much much worse!

Parking wasn't a problem, but there were not many spots close by - so depending on when you go - that could be an issue!

BTW - when they say not that spicy - they mean for a Mexican - for me it was darn hot!"}
{"text":"we are here on average 2-3x a month b/4 we head to the gym .. yes, you read that correctly .. BEFORE we head to the gym .. the entire staff is very friendly & will do all they can to make sure your dining experience is as perfect as it can be .. the food comes out quickly & is always hot & tasty .. Marco is a fixture at the front of house & is always pleasant .. we will be back for sure but then again we are regulars to begin with"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant!! This is an incredibly affordable and quick Mexican restaurant. Service is impeccable, and every server is equally great! The complimentary warm tortilla chips and salsa are one of my favorite aspects of Don Ramon's. I have yet to try a dish here that I didn't like! 

In addition, their drinks and drink specials are great. I absolutely love and recommend the sangria! If you're in the area, please stop in and don't let the semi odd location fool you. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had the ribeye Monterey smothered in cheese with peppers onions and mushrooms. Really good. Never had a bad meal there and service is prompt."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this place for the first time on Memorial Day, and we will definitely be back. Good Mexican is slim pickings in this area. We usually go to Cozumel, which has just been ok lately.

Our server was very attentive and so friendly. I like my drinks when we go out, and it was much appreciated when the server promptly offered us another round just before our glasses were empty. I'm irritated if I want a second drink at a restaurant but the server is nowhere to be found. 

I order tacos wherever I go and these did not disappoint. I noticed the chicken was cooked with peppers and maybe onions. The chicken was tender and not over cooked. The beef was seasoned. The tacos were topped with a generous amount of chihuahua cheese! Nothing makes me more sad than a taco with only a sprinkling of cheese. 

My boyfriend had the burrito California and it was huge. He noticed that the steak was a bit charred, which he enjoyed. 

The drinks were cheap! We were there during happy hour. The guacamole was good. Literally zero complaints."}
{"text":"Average Mexican American restaurant. Closes rather early but that what the market bears in that particular area."}
{"text":"Food was good, but they forgot to charge my friend for his margarita. We left and they literally chased our car down in the parking lot for him to pay. Really unprofessional, especially for a mistake on their behalf."}
{"text":"Had been to this place previously for lunch and had a very good experience very good quality food and the quantity was quite nice. Service was a little slow even though the restaurant was not packed at lunch time. Today we go back for dinner to check on the quality of service and the dinner selection."}
{"text":"bland boring food designed for people raised on taco bell and chi chi's. mi pueblo is far better. located in a strip mall of discount stores."}
{"text":"The food is less than average. The service is not great. Parking is kind of a hassle. Our favorite Mexican is Barrio or Fiesta Jalapeños. Those places are definitely better. Don't get the fries here, they don't understand how to cook them and they are frozen."}
{"text":"Over the weekend, we were looking for a place that was close to our hotel. 
The food was great. The Salsa was delicious, and the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I left my $400 sunglasses on the table. Came back ten minutes later after they had cleaned the table......gone. They stole my glasses and denied it."}
{"text":"This place makes some of the best chicken noodle soup I have had! There beef tacos are the business! And service couldn't be better! You must try."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Our waitress was extremely attentive and quick. As for the food...This place is not horrible however the food lacked flavor. I have eaten at don Ramon in Mayfield and it was absolutely delicious so I thought this one would be the same or close but it was not. The margarita was also extremely watered down & that's about how the food tasted, like a watered down version of the Mayfield Don Ramon. Is water the base ingredient an this restaurant? The chips and salsa however were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Mexican fare...and that's a good thing. Good prices for a robust menu. If you've ever been to a Mexican restaurant and like the cuisine, you'll be happy with what Don Ramon offers. Good atmosphere, friendly wait staff, prompt delivery after ordering. The Cheesesteak Burrito is ridiculously good. It really is a super cheesy sub in burrito form with a side of rice and beans. Oh and the pico de gallo is on point!"}
{"text":"Don Ramon's has truly been going down hill. In the past they have had great food and service. Lately it's been hit or miss. For the most part you wait an eternity for a table while employees run around ignoring you. From there the service just gets worse. During my last 2 visits my meal has come incorrectly. I'm fairly certain that when they've taken my food back they just scraped the correct items onto a new plate. If you're waiting for a server to refresh your water or to even give you the bill, you'll be waiting as long as you waited for your table. I've waited 15 minutes to pay my bill. The food is decent with a large menu but the service is such a turn off it's difficult to enjoy. Skip Don Ramon's. There are better options in the area."}
{"text":"It's cromulent food, for the suburbanite. I guess. Maybe I'm spoiled by eating great Tex-Mex in Dallas, or decent Mexican in St. Louis, but we tried this place the other night and wasn't very pleased. It's the same Mexican restaurant I've seen in 1000 towns, with the same Enchiladas Supremas menu, but everything is $2-3 higher than I'm used to. Normally not a big deal, but it's the same food - and at $7.99 most of these places are marginal.

Pros:
- The food, overall, was fine. Nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about.
- The server was very attentive, and took good care of us and our 2 year old. She made sure he had a cup with a lid and extra napkins. It's the little things.

Cons:
- Chips were definitely not fresh. Maybe made much earlier in the day, and I'm spoiled, but I love freshly made tortilla chips.
- The salsa was bland and goopy. Not pleasantly chunky, or appropriately runny - just not that great. 
- The food, overall, was fine. Not great, not bad. It was, as I said, overpriced. A burrito grande (or whatever they call a burrito with chicken, doused in cheese sauce) was $10.99. Most places that's a $8-9 burrito. 
- The house margarita was definitely a mix, and light on the tequila. Is it so hard to use fresh lime juice?

I can't bag them down to 1-2 stars, as they weren't BAD, so to speak, but they just weren't GOOD. I would certainly go elsewhere for the money."}
{"text":"This is actually my husband's and my favorite Mexican restaurant.
We've always gotten great tasting food here ... and their salsa is so good (I read 1 comment from 2016, that stated the salsa was not very good...no onions or cilantro). Many months ago, occasionally the salsa tasted like plain tomato sauce. Not sure why that was... but for a while now it's been consistently great tasting.
The staff is always friendly and super efficient. Can't wait to see the place when the remodeling is finally finished. It's so nice."}
{"text":"Monday dinner food was great. Server didn't good english but we managed. Tip: bring a Spanish speaking friend and you're in there!!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa anyone?! This is one of the best Mexican places around! We've been here numerous times for numerous occasions and it's always been amazing. 

Let me explain. 

Every time I've been here I always get greeted with a warm smile by the hostess. Even on Cinco De Mayo when it was so busy I was greeted with a warm smile. The service by the servers is always on point. Never had to wait to be greeted, for water, for chips and salsa or anything else. Let's talk about the chips and salsa, to freaking die for. The chips are perfectly salted and the salsa definitely has some kick. We ordered tacos to go last night and we got a HUGE bag filled with chips and a container of salsa, I was surprised that we still got chips and salsa even when ordering to go. 

Everything I've ever ordered for dinner has been amazing and the tacos oh the tacos!"}
{"text":"We haven't eaten at Don Ramon in forever because we usually just go to Cozumel, but recently, we had the opportunity to try it again.  I didn't want to eat a full meal because all we do is eat on the weekends. So I ended up taking 1/2 of my dinner home. I believe what I ordered was called Lindo's Special. It had steak, shrimp, chicken, peppers, onions, cactus, cheese, and other yummy stuff.  It was very good.  It was served with tortillas, but I just ate it with a fork. The price was $12.99.  I don't know the last time I had a dish with shrimp in it for under $15!

My wife had a steak burrito and my son ordered chicken tenders and fries.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  The server was a bit slow and he forgot things, but it was still a good experience.

The leftovers were very tasty the next day."}
{"text":"Pretty typical Mexican restaurant. Really they get that 4th start for the outstanding service. Food was pretty solid across the board but again I cannot skimp on the service from the door, to the table and out the door they were super friendly and quick to any requests."}
{"text":"First time here and my wife and loved it! We'll definitely be coming back. Anything topped with their cheese sauce is great :-)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is great, the reason for the negative review is for the service, specifically one server in general.

There is a guy who speaks hardly any English and is not attentive at all for drink refills, chip refills and such and unfortunately I tend to get him every time.

I went last night with my girlfriend and her kid and it was excellent once we got waited on and got our food but I had to tell my non English speaking server three times I wanted refills. Plus he had to be told twice I wanted flan and fried ice cream.

Unfortunately I think that the place may be family operated so bringing up how bad their cousin or whatever he is provably will not change a single thing.

So on the food side, go there, but I would recommend carry out versus eat in due to the chance you'll get this waiter."}
{"text":"I used to love El Rodeo at this same location-- nice staff, good Mexican-ish food.  Now it's a Don Ramon's.  While the decor is mercifully toned down, the food is really mushy and bland.  Whether you order an enchilada or a burrito, it all tastes the same, slathered in the same orangey-pinkish sauce.  Not even good for suburban Mexicanesque food."}
{"text":"Lousy service.  Uff!  My waiter was not good at all.  The only way he could have shown less interest in his job is if he'd stayed home.  Wow.

Lucky for Don Ramon, the food was good.  I got a shredded beef quesadilla and it was piping hot and full of beef and peppers.  Very tasty.  The half price margaritas ('til 6:30 each weekday) are a good reason to head in here, too.  Just be prepared for less-than-stellar service.

FYI - there is no bar, either, so if you're like me and stopping in by yourself, you'll have to get a table.  Not a big deal, just a little weird.  They have several strategically placed TV's, though, so it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"This one of my top 3 Mexican places in the Cleveland area. I have been going to this restaurant since it was El Rincon at Brookgate. Not sure if they are the same owners but they still have my favorite dish, The Vallarta Special. Place is huge and service is very fast."}
{"text":"Service staff was very friendly but the food was SO BLAND! I have never eaten at a Mexican restaurant and had to season my food. I ordered 3 tacos (shrimp, carne Assad, and chicken) and my wife got the steak fajitas and both needed salt and we left feeling disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with the family. My wife had chicken fajitas the chicken was so dry it looked liked they boiled it . My son had steak fajitas you couldn't even eat the steak it was so chewy just dreadful. I had the special a little bit of everything. Everything looked like a wet diaper so gross covered with so much of this greasy sauce I could not tell what anything was? Except my taco  lol.
We will not be coming back to this place no way. What a waste of money!!!"}
{"text":"Cannot believe what low marks the previous two reviewers gave Don Ramon. We live in Richfield and drive to this Mexican restaurant because it is the best we've found around-- and there are three or four much closer. We've probably eaten there 50 times and always had a good experience.  Have not been for a few months, but surely could not have changed so much. We split the Especiale for Two, which is basically fajitas with shrimp, chorizo, steak, and chicken... and still have a large lunch for the next day. Not sure what was ordered that had cheese sauce all over it-- but I know you can order it without sauce, too, as my son always does that. So, I would say that if these were your first visits, give them another shot."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and good service. I ordered the Burrito Loco and it was average. Chips and salsa  were good."}
{"text":"Um, WOW?? I would not expect this, completely blown away. Truly authentic, and mind blowing experience. I generally only write reviews if it is amazing or terrible, this one knocked it out of the park. Love it! Thanks"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Placed a quite complicated order with three friends and received our appetizers in less than five minutes and the main courses in less than ten. I would highly recommend the lobster burrito or chicken tacos. 

Side note: Do not try the salsa if you cannot handle spicy; it has a MAJOR kick to it."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you, it's a whole different world inside.

Large, clean, and bustling.

It's right around the corner from us, so we come semi-regularly.  Service has always been solid.

The menu is huge.  You can stick to \"typical\" Mexican restaurant combo plates, or you can venture into more authentic options and things you won't find elsewhere.  Such as their Chicken Soup, which was awesome with tons of white chicken in a bowl large enough to fillup Fred Flintstone.

The most authentic?  Assuredly not.  Good food, served fast, hot, and tasty?   Yes indeed."}
{"text":"I have had better but the Mexican food here is pretty good. I had the Grande Shrimp Fajita. I'd say it's a 7.5 out of 10. Even if the food was total crap my motivation to go here is this."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fresh food that's seasoned perfectly. Huge menu. Beautiful dining room. Best Pina Colada I've ever had! Reasonable prices. Our new favorite Mexican Restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican place so far in Cleveland. They are really friendly, very fast, and the food is good. I order the shrimp chimichanga (which I am very picky about), and they do a great job. My husband has ordered several different things and liked them all. My one complaint is that the chips aren't fresh tortilla chips. They're pretty plain and taste just like the ones out of a bag. Also the white cheese dip appetizer was just so-so. We mixed salsa with it to liven it up. But overall we've enjoyed our experiences here, and I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable, great friendly service, good food.  Hit the spot!  The white cheese dip was nicely seasoned.

We were looking for a Mexican place to take the family later on a Saturday night.  This place still had several patrons when we came in and the service and food was as good as we would have expected at a more reasonable hour."}
{"text":"My food is always hot!! That's a plus for me! The manager is nice and helpful. They cook the food extremely fast, makes me wonder lol!! Overall great Americana Mexican close to home!!"}
{"text":"I go here once a week. Great fajitas with a great price- I get them every time I come! Chips and salsa are always fresh and taste great. The best thing is the happy hour- 1/2 off drinks. A large pitcher of margaritas is only $10!   Service and staff are great and always friendly."}
{"text":"Used to be bad here.  New owners/management have made it pretty good. Not the best but pretty good.  Guac is good, margaritas are pretty good.  Service is so so.    They sometimes forget you are there while they talk to customers or among themselves."}
