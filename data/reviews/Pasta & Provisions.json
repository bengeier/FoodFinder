{"text":"Constantly have great experiences at this place. A great place in Charlotte to get your homemade pasta, sauces, and pizzas. If you haven't been to this place (in the heart of Charlotte) give it a shot. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I lived in Rome Italy for 6 months and this is as close as it comes in Charlotte. They have make to order fresh pasta that is fabulous. Great rosemary focaccia, over 15 different types of ravioli, lots of Italian wine and groceries as well. Yum!"}
{"text":"Taste the difference with the fresh pasta from this place!
Yes,. you can buy \"fresh\" pasta in the grocery store, but don't. IT ain't so fresh.
The lobster and crab ravioli was outstanding when combined with my own recipe for vodka sauce, i added shrimp and viola my guests were impressed. I love it because although I enjoy cooking,ravioli is last on my list to whip up in the kitchen.
I've also purchased the cavatelli in the past and was fantastic along with my simple broccoli and garlic sauce.
based on the taste and freshness of the  Pasta I give five stars , skip the chicken dishes in IMO.
Also love the wine selection.
Oh and they have Cannolis!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while and WOW-really impressed.  Even bigger selection of fresh pastas, pre-made dinners, bread plus now olive oils and lots of other things like sliced meats and salads.  My kids went nuts over just the smell of the store.

It is quite honestly as good as any restaurant you can order at but you eat at home and at a fraction of the cost PLUS bonus points for sparing my wife cooking one night."}
{"text":"Basing this review purely on the customer service. Went to pick up some fresh pasta to yesterday and was guided through everything. I had always passed by this shop and finally decided to go in. The man behind the counter was super helpful in making a decision on which pasta to choose and how to prepare it. Being a first time customer I also got a discount. SCORE! I got a pound and a half of wild mushroom linguine pasta and am oh so excited to cook it later this week!"}
{"text":"Amazing pasta and pizza!!! Really fun atmosphere and great outdoor patio area."}
{"text":"Amazing store -  found a great fresh pasta selection and all found a cheese with black truffles. We bought 4 kinds of pasta - all fantasticad fresh !!!"}
{"text":"I feel like we've barely scratched the surface at Pasta & Provisions, and can't wait to try more! Everything we've had from Pasta & Provisions has been perfect. The first time we went on a Friday to take advantage of the current meal deal where if you bring your own container you receive pomodoro or marinara sauce at a discounted per oz. price PLUS a free pound of pasta. We picked spaghetti and pomodoro sauce on this particular night. We couldn't resist picking up a few mini cannoli which were piped fresh right in front of us. The pasta was enough for 4 servings, and we got 32 oz of sauce, so that went a long way too. I think we ended up paying about $16 for the sauce, 6 frozen meatballs, 4 mini cannoli, and the pound of pasta. NOT BAD especially considering it was 4 servings! And, the speed at which the dinner came together once we were home made it even better.

The next time we visited we picked up frozen tortellini and the frozen pizza meal deal, which included a bag of salad and cannoli. We chose the Italian Cold Cut pizza, which was great. It's also worth mentioning that I'm not typically crazy about tortellini, but theirs was delicious.

We also typically park in the back, and more times than not get tired of waiting for a chance to turn left and just go right instead. It's all worth it though!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints about their food items. My two-star review has to do with the fact that I emailed this establishment over a week ago asking for assistance in catering a party at my home...silence. No reply. Guess they don't need my business."}
{"text":"Haven't tried their pasta yet but the Alfredo sauce and the pesto sauce were both amazing and I will be visiting them again."}
{"text":"Walked in for the first time ever based on word of mouth. Bought rosemary pasta and meatsauce.  All of it fresh. Took it home, reheated it and within 15min we had an amazing dish. Most delicious fresh pasta i've ever had. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. If you have recently moved here from NY please don't bother to waste your time here. The fresh pasta is very close to ramen. When looking for fresh ravioli I was pointed to a freezer because, and get ready for this explanation, \"you have to freeze ravioli or it will fall apart\". That is the dumbest explanation I've ever heard. I guess, if you've never had pasta before you might think this is good. If you are willing to spend a little money and have something shipped go here: http://www.borgattis.com. This is what real fresh pasta is supposed to taste like, not the junk served here."}
{"text":"Love the vibe!  Love the space!  

The breads are to die for and good god the take away pizzas are legit!!  

This is the kind of place that made me glad I moved here.  Place has a soul and is packed with 100% awesome foods and provisions!"}
{"text":"Went shopping there last week, great place with lot's of hard to find Italian grocery items. I took home their \"pizza kit\" which consists of fresh dough, freshly made sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese. Tasted great, best Pizza I've ever made myself."}
{"text":"I am sorry.. I would like to buy food from your establishment.... The whole idea of it appeals to me.  That is the good news.  The bad news is... I have bought several of your prepared food items.   They have all been VERY disappointing.  Tonight we ate Baked Ziti.. IMy husband and i both agree that it was so pasty.. and we ended up throwing the most of it away.   honestly you could go to Food Lion and get a better dish.. We expected so much more..I am soorry.  ..... Such a great location"}

{"text":"Finding food while managing a food allergy is never easy. One of our PAK members recently said \"Pasta and Provisions on Park are very attentive to accommodating to food allergies. We are truly grateful."}
{"text":"I was so excited about finding a place in Charlotte that sells fresh pasta and sauces.   We were greated with questions about where we parked our car and if we were coming in the store or restaurant next door.  Walked inside to be greated with head banging music that made me want to stab my ears out.  Found a freezer full of sausage with the sell as date of 4/24 (three days ago) frightening.   Go to the counter to find no fresh ravioli (all frozen) also all frozen Capavetti and Gnocchi.  All types of sauces are also frozen, except one. The kid at the counter is explaining to be how frozen ravioli is better.  Whatever.  The display had a sign for three types of Focacci,  I asked for 2 of the 3 no luck.   I bought the rosemary Focacci and it's sold warm and it's not bad.   I also decided to try a frozen Florantine ravioli and frozen Gnocchi.   They packed the warm bread in the bag on top of the frozen pasta.   Unbelievable.   I will report back on the quality of the half defrosted pasta after I cook it.  Very disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Now that I've made a full Pasta and Provisions meal, I feel fully prepared to give an educated review.  

Service: Rockin'. The little shop was packed (mostly with Myers Park-esque women who seemed to be staring at me, but I can ignore them) but there was always a friendly and knowledgeable staff ready to help. 

I asked what I should make for dinner since I haven't tried their fresh pastas.  A mushroom one, and a garlic rosemary was recommended.  The person helping me said the linguine should only be boiled for 45 seconds.  She got me the right amount, and went to the back where the pasta is cut and prepared, to get the portion.  It's nifty to see the pasta come zipping into the cashier area on a wire, hung near the ceiling. 

Foccacia (sp?) bread comes in an ENORMOUS wheel, almost the size of a large pizza of car wheel.  You can get it cut in half.  To go with it, I got a $2.50 bag of spring mix and a container of Greek (I know, it's Greek in an Italian store, but it's fantastic) white bean spread. The bread was light and fresh, the spread so savory and delicious...I ate half the container before dinner.  Oops!

There's a freezer section, a few of them full of frozen filled pastas like ravioli in different varieties (seafood, squash, mushroom, crab, cheese, etc.) and frozen sauces.  There are freshly refrigerated ones too, like the popular marinara and pomodoro sauces.  I chose the pomodoro with 12 meatballs. 

I also got some peach soda for bellinis for a New Year's party, and some house cheese blend (parm and a couple other cheeses blended together in a plastic baggie), block of imported fontina cheese, and a small bottle of house dressing. 

Everything was delicious.  The cooking directions of 45 seconds is spot on for al-dente pasta.  Compared to dried stuff, you'll never want to go back.  Just the right amount of chew and nice garlicky flavor.  The sauce too was super flavorful and blows the jarred Ragu stuff from the grocery store out of the water.  

I forgot to pick up a canoli or one of the pie things at the front.  Oh well, next time. 

PS: The prices are higher than the grocery store, but you really get what you pay for here.  Can't wait to plan out another meal here!"}
{"text":"after several visits in less than a week, i figured it was time to let you know the deal-it is AWESOME! i had the 5-topping pizza (you get to select them from the list that the guy keeps in his head) which costs $10 . the thin and crispy crust is a perfect compliment to the flavor of the sauce (robust, but not overpowering). i chose pepperoni, sausage, onions, meatball, and black olives. after just a few minutes the pizza was out of the oven and on its way to my gut. the pizza was among the best i have ever eaten-and i have eaten tons of pizza from new york to ecuador. i decided to dine in so i added a bottle of gold peak tea.there was a selection of sparkling waters and other beverages. the wooden counters allow you to look out upon park road and think about how good the pizza is. i mean, seriously... this was outstanding. two times in a row. the cook is friendly, but a bit reserved. but, i don't want him to do cartwheels. i want him to keep churning out that delicious pizza.the other guy at the register was very thankful for my visit(s) . they also have a wine selection and fresh pasta to go if you are enough of a sucker to try to math their skills. if you haven't tried this joint do so TODAY."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh, ravioli with pamadoro sauce incredible, perfectly spiced. Must eat more pasta!! Beautiful and tasty slice of provo and prosciutto"}
{"text":"My wife is italian and from NY..... enough said... haha she went down memory lane at this place. we found this place by typing in \"best canoli in charlotte\" well yup its the best. 

 bought some pasta for Nanny... yup its approved!"}
{"text":"Pasta and Provisions is a gem of a place located on Park Road next to Brawleys Beverage.

They specialize in homemade pastas and sauces. Inside, you will find a counter where you can order pastas, salads, sandwiches made to order. In the back is a large selection of wines, frozen pastas made in house, frozen Italian meals (lasagna, soups, etc) made in house, desserts, dips, etc. Essentially everything you would want to throw a party or a nice night in!

Most recently, my husband and I came here Saturday to get some food to go for our date with our couch and Netflix. We settled on the mushroom ravioli with maranara sauce, add meatballs, one of the salads (side note: There salads are Huuuuuge and definitely for sharing), and a thing of Queens Charlotte bacon and pimento cheese with crackers. Excellent foodie night. Everything was delish. I loved the meatballs!

They have a decent size patio in the back if you want to take your food outside to eat (not a ton of seating inside)

Excellent staple to the Park Road area!"}
{"text":"Just picked up an order of fresh pasta. Great product and an atmosphere that can't be beat. A must see and must visit."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a casual lunch or a warm evening dinner on the patio. Very inter menu with a variety of options. Cool ambiance and reasonable price."}
{"text":"When I go to Pasta & Provisions it's like I've died and gone to carb heaven. Seriously, this place makes me so happy. If I have more $, I'd stock my fridge and freezer full of their goods.

If nothing else, you HAVE to grab a bag of BUTTERNUT SQUASH RAVIOLI and and round of fresh FOCACCIA.  The bags of pasta are fresh made and then frozen, all you have to do is drop them in a pot of boiling water for 6-8 minutes and VOILA! you have a perfectly easy, delicious lunch or dinner with local, fresh, simple ingredients. 

Let's get back to the bread. The rosemary focaccia that they have everyday is to die for and you can even buy half a round if you're not as carb crazy as I am. Just make sure you buy the focaccia the day you're going to eat it, because since it's not made with preservatives, it doesn't stay fresh for longer than a few days. Even then, when it's stale but still good, it makes a wonderful french toast.

IF they have it, make sure you try the focaccia with feta, sun dried tomatoes and olives. I'm salivating just thinking about it. It's really sharp and rich, but amazing. I wanna do a happy dance every time I take a bite. 

Only complaint is that parking is crazy limited."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Incredible food, homemade fresh pasta, excellent Italian high end groceries, fun area to eat outside, super friendly staff. Just awesome!"}
{"text":"This is one of Charlotte's food gems. The smell of good olive oil and fresh pasta that permeates the space is worth the visit. Smartly chosen wines (most from a NC importing and distribution company), delicious house made treats like raviolis and focaccia, and a friendly staff...quite the trifecta. You can also pick up amazing Balsamics, Olive oils and CHEESES! The cheese (outside of Ormann's) is the best in town! Try the truffle cheese with the DeForville Chardonnay (from the Piedmont region of Italy) and then thank me. Or, more appropriately, thank Tommy, the owner.

This place rocks."}
{"text":"Italian food and supplies ready to go.  Unusually good home made sauces and pastas.  Great pre made ravioli, lasagna pizza etc.  Ready to take home and warm or cook."}
{"text":"This is an excellent little Italian grocery, giving my old favorite in Chicago a run for its money.  Delicious fresh made pastas, a generous selection of wines, and of course all of your favorite Italian store go-tos like the Limonata, the Italian cookies, the fresh meats and cheeses.  Plus the whole aesthetic of the place is just plain charming.  I'm putting this in my grocery rotation, at least monthly."}
{"text":"It was my first time there. A friend of mine had recommended it and it was much more than what I expected. The guy working there helped me out, explained everything to me. Gave me great advice on what to get exactly, the amount and what to mix it with. Even though I walked in 20 minutes before they closed, I never felt rushed or anything. He really took the time to help us out. I will definitely be coming back. Amazing store with great customer service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love coming here to order fresh pasta to go! It's fantastic! 

The taste is incredible and I love that you can freeze it or use it within 3 days of being in the fridge. It's so much faster than making it myself.  

I had the pizza and pasta ordered in and sat outside. The outside area was quaint. The cheese pizza was pretty good, but I thought the fettuccini Alfredo was terrible. 

My friend was so nice she traded with me. So I was happy with the pizza."}
{"text":"If you know what to expect, this place cannot be beat.  There is not a lot of seating, only a bar facing a window while we were there, but arriving at 11:15 on a Friday was perfect.  My wife and I split a caprese pizza and the Italian sandwich.  WOW!  We were blown away.  The pizza's thin crust was nice and crispy.  We had ample mozzarella and delicious balsamic vinegar.  There was so much flavor.  We even added pancetta.  The sandwich was amazing too.  Plenty of filling and everything worked very well together.  We left stuffed and very happy.  I even bought tiramisu from the freezer for later.  The total bill for everything, including the desert and tip, was ~$40, but it was worth it.  One person could eat very well here for $15.  Since it is about a mile from my office, I will be back often!  Great spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome! The patio space so nice on warm days. Food is on point, great to sit down and eat out take it to go. Everyone that works there is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Everything we've ever had here has been delicious. Our favorites are the white sauces and filled pastas. You also can't go wrong with a spaghetti pasta and the pomodoro sauce. Great variety of wines."}
{"text":"Pasta, wine, cheese, meat, desserts, frozen, fresh...you name it, this place has it. Small place right next to the Sundries on Providence. I hard to pass this place and not hit it up for a visit on the way back home. I don't think I've ever spent more than $20 here, but it's a fun place to walk around and walk out with a couple items you think you need. Either way, I'm making Italian in the next few days due to a visit here...not a bad thing! 

Do yourself a favor and visit soon. Tip...Parking is usually full in front, but there's a back lot with extra parking."}
{"text":"This is a great place to pick up every thing you need for a quick Italian dinner for yourself or even if you find yourself with an unexpected dinner party in an hour!    Fresh focaccia and breads, cheeses and antipasti, salads dressings, and pasta of course.  You can put together a very impressive dinner for your family or guests in a matter of minutes.  

Fresh pasta in all sorts of colors and favors - you pick the cut and how much you want.  

Lots of frozen and prepared raviolis and lasagna etc.    Sauces of different kinds.   I love the sun dried tomato sauce on pasta and I always keep it on hand to use either as a nice spread on fresh baguettes or quick crostini appetizer base.   

Plus all the extras you need from wine, oils, risotto, polenta, seasonings, tomato sauces and such.   Great specialty store."}
{"text":"Fresh pasta, sauce, ravioli, and bread.  Nice joint but it is a market not a restaurant so you can impress someone at home."}
{"text":"I just love you. Thanks for the pasta for last night. People went insane over it. The lobster and crab ravioli is the best. I have to start making more of a point to come back weekly."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place a ton, but finally went in, and wow! So cool! I am Italian, and I loved the homemade pasta selection. Such an awesome little niche. Will definitely be back, and often to get my homemade pasta fix! Lots of other goodies around the store too."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Super nice staff and amazing food."}
{"text":"Vast selection of Italian foods."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for Italian lovers in the area.  My wife and I have had a few good trips to Italy and when we get back we are usually able to find our new favorite wines of the region in this shop.  While we're there I'll probably pick up some semolina for our own fresh pasta and I'll definitely pick up some cracked pepper gnocchi to save me the headache (along with some sweet potato gnocchi for another dish).

The service is spot on and friendly, the selection of imports very thorough, and from a quick already made meal to picking up components that you might be missing it's awesome.

Another secret of the store is they supply fresh pasta to a lot of the local restaurants.  The owners are also big Slow Food supporters and couldn't be nicer."}
{"text":"This place is badass.  They've got all kinds of homemade Italian goodies.  Some of my favorites include the fresh pasta, freshly frozen gnocchi & ravioli, all the sauces, fresh focaccia breads, and the cannolis!!  I've never been disappointed with anything.  Sometimes I ask the dude that always wears Red Wings gear for recommendations and he is continually spot on.  The staff in general is really helpful.  I love supporting this local Italian grocery store.

It's now a Sunday tradition to stop here and then grab a couple bottles of wine from Trader Joe's (They have a nice selection here, but TJ's is so cheap...).  It usually costs under $25 for 2 people.  Sweeeeet deal."}
{"text":"Amazing. Love the variety of bake dishes, pasta and sauces. They also offer fresh balsamic, vinegar, fresh sliced deli meats and bread. Love that they also offer Lenny boy kombucha. Haven't been able to sit in and order to eat yet but definitely will be back. Tiramisu was huge! Only downside was we went on a Sunday and they were stocked low on many things we wanted after making the trip there. Hope next time they will have prepared for the busy weekend."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte! The pasta is obviously out of this world. Other gems include gorg/artichoke spread, chicken lasagna, and pomodoro sauce. The Philly cheesesteak is not technically on the menu but it's amazing, just ask for it. The list goes on, Tuscan kale salad and all pizzas are phenom. Customer service is on point and they always play good music. Look for the garden terrace to the left and grab a beer or glass of wine while you eat. Eat pasta run fasta!"}
{"text":"Out...freaking standing!!!! I'm from NJ and have lived in NC since 2002. Haven't had a good Italian meal since I moved to Charlotte. This sauce is absolutely amazing. The meatballs are incredible. I can't say enough great things about this place. If u live in Charlotte or within 100 miles, u need to check it out.."}
{"text":"I just realized I never wrote a review on Pasta & Provisions.  I think I secretly wanted to keep this gem to myself.  I don't want anyone to know why when I make pasta it always tastes so much better then theirs.  That's right the secret is fresh pasta but who has the time to make it themselves these days.  I frequently stop by Pasta & Provisions to pick up all kinds of yummy stuff.  I love that I can get everything I need in one place for a great Italian meal and don't have to hassle with a large grocery store.

The garlic and parsley pasta is amazing.  They import a lot of food items I can't find anywhere else.  In fact they carry a sausage that I've never been able to find in twelve years of living in North Carolina.  Grab a loaf of their fresh baked bread and one of their homemade sauces and you have a great meal in no time.  You can also pickup a prepackaged meal like lasagna, chicken parmesan etc. & don't forget to check out the wine selection.  If you eat Italian food like I do then this is the place for you.

Besides the great food the staff  is incredibly friendly and helpful which  keeps me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to start with P&P. This place excels on a level of Italian procurement that hasn't accurately or sufficiently been defined by the culinary world. Located off of Providence (and a bit difficult to squeeze in and out of their faux parking lot) it's the neighborhood shop for all those seeking to attain the level of \"savant\" in preparing their pasta-laden meal(s).

First of all, the staff is so friendly it hurts. They genuinely are interested in what you are preparing. They aren't trying to shove a $200 wheel of Parmigiano into your shopping bag. They want to help you acquire the flavors that you're looking for and, without a doubt, they'll have what you're looking for. Have no idea what to prepare? They do. Ask one of the staff members for a recommendation and they'll hook you up with the starch, protein or mise en place to pull off a meal like Mario Batali in a super hero cape. 

One of my favorite things about this place is the smell. Breath deeply, newbie shoppers. You'll breathe in the fresh garlic, herbs and fresh pasta being prepped in the back. What a treat and right in your Myers Park backyard. 

I've ventured in on several occasions for dried pasta and other canned goods (pepperoncini peppers, olives, tomatoes, etc) but you can't beat their fresh pasta. They have over 10 different kinds in-house. My favorites are the garlic rosemary or the wild mushroom. Sampled a few of the others and they are all wonderful as well. All are ideal for preparing ravioli, lasagna, spaghetti or any other pasta dish you're looking to make. 

This place is a market titan for its class. Wonderful selection, staff and overall presentation. Look forward to visiting every single time!"}
{"text":"Amidst the chaos of Park Road and Charlotte in general you can have an amazing meal and relax with a glass of wine or beer. The patio is awesome."}
{"text":"So glad we found this great little store! Not only do they have homemade pasta (memories of my grandma's tortellini!) but they have homemade sauces, a great selection of wine and cheeses! I will be frequenting this place to stock up on the homemade gnocchi and cavatelli!  (you can keep them frozen and cook in 5 minutes... Dump some of the homemade pesto on it and u got a meal!) Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.
All the food is delicuous (meatball sub, philly cheese steak sub, cheese ravioli)
Good beer selection of a few drafts and local cans.
Relaxng outside seating
Lots of refrigerated/frozen dishes to take home.
New to south park area, this is our new lunch staple."}
{"text":"Excellent cheese selection.

Beautiful homemade pasta and sauces...I can't say enough about how good every single sauce I have tried is, served with their perfect pasta. 

I've had to edit my review of Pasta & Provisions for one simple reason. Their store is so unorganized, and their staff so lazy and unmotivated that it is a chore to try to shop there.

I can't remember the last time I went to their store that all of the items that I purchased made it home in my bag. They will randomly leave out at least one item every trip.

I don't know if this is an effort to increase their profits by stealing from their customers, or if their front counter staff are just that incompetent. But, even with a concerted effort, I still end up at home unpacking my bag, wondering how exactly that I don't have the bread I purchased, or the cheeses, or the ham... or whatever it is that they have charged me for that they didn't put in the bag.

Don't try to call to complain either! There is NEVER any management or owner there, and you will talk with a high school aged person, who doesn't know and doesn't care."}
{"text":"While temporarily living in Charlotte for a few months I came across Pasta and Provisions. Their fresh pasta and sauces rival anyone and made this New Yorker feel really hit at home. The store has an impressive variety of wine and the staff was alway able to give great recommendations, never disappointing. Highly recommended and also suggest the white bean dip, fantastic spread for bread or crackers."}
{"text":"This is a dangerous place.  I could eat so much of the food.  

I had a mission though.  Use a coupon for buy sauce, get a pound of free fresh pasta.  Picking out the flavor of pasta was a tough choice, but the little lightning bolts denoting a favorite flavor made it a bit easier.  The final choice was garlic & rosemary linguini.  I made a quick decision on the sauce and went with the pomodoro to try something different then my normal marinara.  

I couldn't resist a baguette.  The pasta, sauce and bread totaled to around $8 - a great price for an amazing dinner.

The pasta was just as delicious as I was expecting, the sauce was fun with a little kick and the bread was gone quickly.  

Glad I decided to expand my bubble and check out Pasta & Provisions.  I definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and amazing food! Great spot to pick up something for a dinner party!!"}
{"text":"2 words!!! PASTA HEAVEN!! Stopped by today wanted to make what I would consider an overkill. Spinach and turkey lasagna with fresh spinach pasta. Stepped in and right away, I was greeted by 2 very friendly handsome men that work there. I'm thinking, oh wow. They may find a thick asian chick like me attractive. Hubba Hubba!!!!  Then another customer step into the store and they're just as friendly. Ok, wishful thinking on my part. 
Looking around, I'm overwhelmed.. Thinking of Mario and many other famous Italian chefs who can possibly come here to get all their goodies. Fresh or frozen. Truly wish they have a location in Steele Creek. All their pastas can be easily custom cut. I wanted spinach lasagna and I asked them. They said yes they can cut it for me.. 5 mins later.. I'm holding a beautiful bag of green deliciousness! The staffs are friendly and they seem to know I'm lost and not a great cook. As they bagging my pasta. They provided with instructions. 
I must say. I like to thank them for that.. Little did I know I don't have to cook them in advance because that's exactly what I was going to do! \"I'll be back!\" (In Arnold's voice)"}
{"text":"I'm a lover of bolognese. Anytime I get Italian food, it's typically the same order: Caesar salad and bolognese pasta and bread. Wish this place had that. Maybe I just didn't see it. 

It's my dudes birthday and his fave food is Italian. Being the good wife that I am I decided to bring Italy to him. 

The dudes at the store today were extremely helpful. They told me about the deal where you can get fresh pasta, a container of sauce, a bag of salad, and bread, all for $20! That's what's up! And I dont even have to tip AND I'll have leftovers! That's what's up! 

I got the rosemary pasta, pomodoro sauce with meatballs, herb foccacio bread, and decided to get a bottle of red wine. 

The food was AWESOME SAUCE! Literally. The sauce was seasoned well and the meatballs were tender. The pasta itself was so fresh and tasty. 

I'd definitely go back. Maybe for some hot food next time."}
{"text":"Wonderful!!!!!!!!!  I just had fresh pasta and pomodoro sauce and it was out of this world!  I cannot wait to come back and try other things :-)  I think this is my new fav place!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place, smells amazing.  Everything behind the counter is so fresh and home made, very beautiful.  People are very friendly and helpful here.

A few shelves of Italian ingredients, probably the largest selection in the area.  Bummed I didn't find what I was looking for and still needed to order online but I'm probably not the average customer!

Overall it's great for those that don't have time to make their own pastas, breads or mozzarella and want a fresh home style option."}
{"text":"So disappointing! I guess coming from a Brooklyn NY we are spoiled, but I was hopeful to find a place that had Italian delicacies . Very mediocre to say the least. I am now more than ever looking to do my own cooking and improvise. Don't go if you are from the 5 boroughs and especially if you are Italian. The fresh mozzarella was a real let down and customer service  so not good!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the Madison Park neighborhood...or what will soon be known to everyone in Charlotte as Montford Park. Directly off of Park Rd across from Brawley's (complementary combo). 

It's a great new addition. It's a deli and small market with fresh pasta, sauces, wine, and items to fill your Italian pantry. Their other location on Providence makes the fresh pasta. If you want a quick sandwich (that is good portion) or a kale salad for lunch, they have that with a side bag of chips and a bottled beverage. 

There are two bar tables with maybe 7 or 8 stools facing Park Road so you can watch the cars passing by while munching on a made to order sandwich. It looks like they are making a side outdoor patio. Maybe 10 parking spots; perfect to drop in, grab and go. 

If you're in the neighborhood, pick up something for dinner."}
{"text":"Ciao! Great selection of Italian treats, sweets, meats, and ...cheese (tried to think of a way to make cheese rhyme). Walking in I felt a bit overwhelmed with the delicious options everywhere! 

You can walk in without a clue to what to make for dinner and leave with an entire meal, plus a bottle of wine. It's perfect for those weeks when you know are going to be killer and you're going to be exhausted...pick up a ready-to-eat meal and just pop it in the oven or grab some fresh pasta!

The staff were really helpful and friendly! 

The only downfall was the cannoli. Now I know Nicole W. sang praises about this pastry, but I must have gone on a not fresh day. It was small, didn't taste fresh, and pricey for the size & quality. Perhaps my expectations are high since my only experience with cannoli's are from Little Italy in the Boston area where the cannoli's are so big they require two hands to eat them. This cannoli issue can be easily forgiven since the rest of the place was impressive!

Go, explore, and enjoy! Grazie, Pasta & Provisions!"}
{"text":"As soon as I pulled into the parking lot I knew my dinner was going to be delicious. Wonderful smells wafted out- tomato, garlic, Italian spices...mmmmm.

I have driven past this place for years been too intimated to go inside. This was a mistake. I tried the garlic and parsley hand cut pasta (the recommend garlic and rosemary was out) paired with the ammmaazzzing Pomodoro sauce- HIGHLY RECOMMEND. It has just the right amount of zing.

The next time I have to bring a side or dish for a party I can't wait to grab their prepared mac and cheese and other tasty treats. If you are willing to pay a bit more for local and fresh then this is the place to score your next dinner. You will be rewarded. 

PS- Parking can be tricky don't even try for the spaces in the front head straight for the parking lot in the back."}
{"text":"If you are craving yummy, fresh made pasta and sauces, then visit Pasta & Provisions.  The staff is great and will help you with any questions you might have.  The pricing is very reasonable for what you get.  I love to shop here for a quick Italian dinner I can prepare in less than 10 minutes.  They have almost anything Italian here.  Their front parking can be a bit challenging but there is lots of room in the back"}
{"text":"Fabulous market, lots of fresh delicious ingredients, wide selection. I'm not sure what else can be said about Pasta & Provisions! They have delicious olives, fresh pastas and sauces to choose from but honestly my favorite thing from here is their baguettes. Do yourself a favor and get one immediately. They have fresh or also frozen which you can heat up later, both excellent options!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday for first time and was pleasantly surprised. Daughter had sandwich and I had fresh garlic pasta with marinara and everythign was delicious and tasted very fresh. We had to buy one of their fresh baked cakes which was really good as well. Will come back for sure. Staff was very nice as well"}
{"text":"Fantastic neighbourhood gem for take-home Italian fare. Pretty much the closest thing you'll get to home made - no frills but absolutely delicious pasta, sauces, and even main dishes. Their chicken parmigiana is absolutely fantastic. All dishes come with easy instructions for heating at home and the pasta is so fresh it's ready in a pinch. Service is incredibly courteous and quick."}
{"text":"This place is like a little Italian grocery and a prepared foods shop.  They have the best fresh pasta (I love how it takes like 2 minutes to cook)- they have a bunch of different kinds of ravioli, spaghetti, and other classic Italian dishes.  If you want to try something a little different the sweet potato ravioli is awesome!  I also highly reccomend their sauces and breads.  This place also has a pretty decent wine selction.  This is the perfect to stop and pick-up something that you can prepare at home in minutes."}
{"text":"You will never again want pasta from anywhere but this place after experiencing it. The garlic rosemary pasta is the best I have ever had. There is not a dish in this store that you won't like. I always love how I can call ahead and they will have my order ready when I swing by on the way home from work. It also makes the perfect meal to take to families who have just had a baby or are recovering from illness/surgery. You really cannot beat this place."}
{"text":"pasta and provisions is the best place to get italian food and supplies.  

every nook and cranny of the place shows how much care they put into creating and sustaining a place where customers can find a taste of italy.

the staff is amazing as well.  they are extremely knowledgeable about ingredients and are just nice to chat with as well.

if you love italian, or want to try something new, p&p is the place to go!!

eat pasta, run fasta!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a nice little surprise. All the pics I've seen on Insta had me like YES! So I went for the drive on a Friday night. I'm originally from NY and besides family and friends. FOOD is what I miss. It's a nice little speciality store with a wonderful patio to dine out at. Me and my sons felt very comfortable to stay awhile. The menu selection was more limiting than I anticipated and asking for a few items seemed to be a unheard of. 
(EX:chicken parm hero)I was told we don't have that!?
I said you have chicken cutlets, mozzarella, sauce, and bread. All you do is assemble them together to make a sandwich. I've seen the pics online that it's been done before. The guy said ok it shouldn't be a problem. I received chopped up grilled chicken pieces in my sandwich with the other ingredients? It was good but not what I asked for or the taste I was looking for. We ordered a few different things including pasta. Which was very fresh tasting and the garlic bread was delicious. My sons enjoyed it. I'll try it again maybe order everything separate and assemble myself."}
{"text":"I bought a good bottle of wine for a very decent price.  But, my main reason for visiting was lasagna supplies.  They had everything I needed (I did have to get mozzarella instead of my preferred scamorza but not a big deal).  They have fresh, ready to bake lasagna noodles that were out of this world. 
I was told that the brownie I bought was the best ever, and they were right!"}
{"text":"The ambience is great. The patio couldn't be cuter and the market is nice. But gotta be honest... actually don't think their pasta is very good"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, had several different varieties of ravioli and sauce. Very fresh with great flavor. Great value and service"}
{"text":"We drive all the way from Atlanta to stock up; lugging dry ice and a huge cooler; pasta + sauces + pizza + t-shirts.  Varieties you cannot get anywhere else.  Freshest possible, cut exactly the way you want, rich in flavor.  Only issues I have are my ignorance of Italian wines they stock, and their website won't work on my iPad."}
{"text":"Lets talk about carbs, baby...

Pasta & Provisions does it right. I want to \"carb load\" every day of my life when I come to this side of town. I have such a hard time coming in here and only buying what I came in for. Guaranteed, I always leave with a least one bag of meat ravioli and one container of meatballs and pomodoro sauce. They have everything labeled and it's easy to find. If you can't, ask someone everyone is super helpful and friendly. I love the family meal deal. Let's be honest - I'm a single girl. The family meal deal feeds me for days - for $20! Winning!! And now it's available every day. Score. 

I will come here time and time again. There's different daily specials, and we're talking like real \"omg. I must come on a Tuesday\" specials. Fresh, delicious. Bring your own bag - you won't get in trouble if you don't, but it's appreciated. Lovely, local gem.

Eat pasta, run fasta!"}
{"text":"This place is pricey but I am a foodie and gotta do what I gotta do. I am not above driving over to Trader Joe's for some cheap olive oil and a block of cheese to compliment their delicious fresh pastas and sauces.  My prior experiences there have been pleasant with friendly and helpful staff but today was an exception.  It was the music:  Screaming 70s classic rock playing at ear splitting decibel levels.  Totally not relaxing and no way did I want to leisurely shop.  If I want fresh pasta I am sure I will return but today's visit kind of ruined my opinion of the place."}
{"text":"I love the pasta here. The food is amazing. I only give this 2 stars for the simple fact that I am a Vegan and every time I come here I get an attitude from the cook. I ask for a compromise for them to add veggies to my pasta. I continually get the same remarks and facial expressions. Not good at all. I questioned the cook as to why there is a problem with me requesting veggies on my pasta. His BS response was that he wants people to taste the pasta. I'm like don't they add meatballs or chicken... As you can see that convo went no where. 

I really try to support local businesses but this was a fail.

I really hope their attitude about this changes. FYI: I even asked them to charge me for a meat to add the veggies."}
{"text":"There's a lot of 5-star here... the pasta is AMAZING. I recommend the arugula pepper or the garlic parsley. You can definitely recommend this place on pasta alone, but the sauce is great too. Pomodoro is legit 5-stars. It's also a cool night spot with dinner, wine, & beer. They're right across the street from Brawley's, but this is the place to be, with a hidden patio area. The people that work here are also some of the nicest folks you'll meet. Good people & good pasta. Who can ask for more?"}
{"text":"This store is where I go to get my birthday meal every year.  the food is incredible, and the family who owns it are very fine people.  I get some nice homemade spaghetti with homemade Italian sausage, homemade marinara, cannolis with pistachios, focaccia bread, fava beans, and a nice vino tinto...  yessir."}
{"text":"A small shop that contains everything you need for the ultimate gourmet pasta dinner! You'll find brands and varieties of pasta and pasta dinner ingredients that will probably be difficult to find elsewhere. They also sell pre-made entrees, some cheeses, and other interesting locally made goods. A bit on the pricey side, but that's to be expected for gourmet ingredients :)"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here and was next door having lunch. I went in and was a little overwhelmed by all of the great stuff, but the 2 guys at the counter were super friendly and told me what was their favorites.  I bought some EXCELLENT homemade ravioli and they guys said since it was my 1st visit I could pick out a bag of any fresh pasta! I was so excited & I chose the rosemary fettuccine.  It was so so good!  If I ever need to make a special dinner or have guests over, I know just where to go to get the best ingredients.  If you like Italian, I would recommend stopping in there just to try something you normally wouldnt with the help/recommendations of the staff. They know just what to pick!"}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh pasta, they have sandwiches too, little side items to go, very friendly staff and quick. Perfect choice for a homemade-ish meal and across the street from Brawley's!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  Food came out quickly, and I must say, some of the best pasta I've ever had.  Although, I will say that I blame them for my after lunch food coma....totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places on planet Earth. Amazing food. Great food and wine shopping options. And AMAZINGLY friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"This place has great food and super friendly staff. This is not what this review is about.

I came on a Thursday around 6:15. I parked in the parking lot as I planned to eat here. My husband was at Brawleys and I was going towards the patio to get him. A woman on a bike who I learned from the staff was the owners wife, went off on me about how I shouldn't park there. She was very rude to me and i was really upset about it. I probably won't be back. I understand the parking issues but you might want to be more careful about telling off your customers."}
{"text":"All the pasta! They make ravioli in house with a variety of fillings. With fresh bread and sauces too, there's plenty to like here. They have quite an eclectic wine selection too. Don't missing the new pizzas too!"}
{"text":"This place is like magic you didn't know that you needed in your life. We have passed this place before and didn't even know they sold food until we yelped it and said let's try it. So glad we did. It's a cute and cozy place and the staff was wonderful and helpful with all of my questions.  After we ordered we went outside and it got even better it was so relaxing to sit outside and enjoy your meal here. If you haven't checked them out please do they won't disappoint at all."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick lunch and were definitely not disappointed! I had the garlic pasta with pesto, and my boyfriend had the chicken ravioli with the tomato sauce. Both were phenomenal. Their sandwiches also looked awesome. We ate out on the patio and it was beautiful, and there was even a dog visiting for lunch with its person. Everything was very fresh and delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good product, great staff, bad pricing.  I got a problem with a 10.99 thin crust vegetable pizza. That's excessive.   Most of their pricing seems $3/4 too much and overtime it adds up.  There stuff is not truly vegetarian either if you read the pricing.  Overall good spot but like to see a little bit more reasonableness."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak was delicious! They have a great variety of craft beers to choose from as well as the option to try their Kombucha. They also have nice options for pasta to go and the food I ordered was delicious!! I would highly recommend checking this local spot out. I plan to come back and order pasta to cook at home as well as have a beer while I wait.
Great price and food -bravo P&P!!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY love this place. all the pastas, breads, cheese etc. are incredible. Their pizzas are amazing, their meats are perfect and best of all very well priced. Take it from me a true Italian you will love anything you have from here."}
{"text":"Got the Caprese sandwhich - fresh ingredients and amazing bread! Great patio and beverage selection"}
{"text":"Went here with high hopes, left disappointed. As you walk inside you gets welcomed by the garlic smell. This is a big turn off, which shows this is not a truly Italian place but rather an american tailored italian. I was offered many things but bought just the focaccia which was terrible. Kind of disappointing but not surprising... I am yet to find a truly Italian market in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem. I recently moved in nearby and can walk here from my apartment, which is a huge win. They have great sandwiches, fresh pastas, and wine--so really, everything you could ever possibly need. They're also open past dinner time during the week, which is really convenient if I didn't get the chance to buy something to cook.

I've had their caprese sandwich a couple of times and it's great. They toast the bread with the balsamic on it so it makes a little bit of a crust, which is delicious with the heaps of tomato and mozz. I've also had the turkey sandwich, which is also tasty. The bacon jam on it is wonderful and the avocado makes it all very creamy. My husband and I have also grabbed a couple of hot pastas to go. We tried the rosemary linguine with pomodoro & meatballs and a linguine with alfredo sauce. The portions are generous and come with a small roll, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. We were big fans of the meatballs, too. My husband comes from an Italian family and these are pretty great. 

One time we grabbed one of their massive tiramisus to go to have at home, and for I think around $8 this thing is huge. It's perfection. And it didn't last in our fridge more than a day. Whoops. They have a great little wine area, too, with tons of great Italian wines and some discount bottles. There's still so many things I haven't tried like the raviolis and pizzas, but I can't wait to come back to try more."}
{"text":"So coming down to Charlotte from Chicago was a adjustment....but finding Pasta and Provisions made it a bit easier... I am Half Italian..I was stunned that this was the only Italian Market when I first got down here...But it is one of the absolute best markets in the city. All sorts of Homemade Pasta....the Best Gnocchi, the best fettuccine..any where. Their Freezer section is full of prepared dinners and sauce. The dry ingredients are there for you as well. Great selection of Olive Oils and Dry Pasta's But let me tell you..try their sauces....Their Alfredo is a white cloud of silkiness and flavor, Their Pesto is green and delicious, Their Red sauces make my mouth water just thinking about them!   In the freezer is also Tiramisu and and Almond Cake which will make you break your New Years Resolution about eating sugar!. The Park Rd Location offers Sandwiches that are incredible..Ask for the Dominic! HE is my son who has a great palate and orders his Italian Sub with Everything and More!! Really if you are a Chicago or New York Or New Jersey transplant..you HAVE to go here!!"}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed till the past weekend.  So glad I found it (well my fab g/f found it and brought me to it ;)).  It's like a traditional Italian deli/pasta shop right here in Charlotte.  Too cool!  So many fresh ingredients from all the fresh cut deli meats, to the freshly made pasta as well as roasted veggies, sauce and of course the deserts!  I will definitely be visiting this place more often in an attempt to expand my culinary horizons!

Note:  For the single guys out there that might not know how to prepare a great romantic dinner....this is your one stop shop!  Come by here and you can find every ingredient you need already made up so all you have to do is throw it together and BAM! You'll look like a superstar!"}
{"text":"Eat pasta, run fasta.  At least that's the logo at this local Italian specialty grocer and pasta maker.  No doubt pastabilities (ha!) abound for carb loading here, whether for your latest endurance run or for your Sunday dinner food coma.

This is an old-school grocery with a small but amble selection of Italian meats, cheeses, oils, and sweets.  They also have a small selection of wines , but the show stoppers are their fresh pastas and sauces.  In other words, everything you need for your Italian feast can be had here.

Rather than peruse the cooler and the freezer, I encourage you to check out the large blackboard behind the counter.  All the pasta options and sauces are clearly laid out and explained.  Just make your selections and tell the staff how much you need or how many are eating.  For fresh pasta, the register staff sends your order back to the kitchen staff on a little zip line, who fills the order and zips it back to the register in just a minute.  Raviolis are pre-made and frozen.  Sauces are either frozen or fresh and in the cooler.  No worries, they all taste great.

Fresh salad greens and focaccia breads are also usually available, and located near the register.  Do check out the wide selection of olive oils and other jarred goodness located pin the tiny aisles to the right.  Pricey?  A little; but you'll find things here not available at any other mega-grocery in town.

This is a local gem that any foodie will put on their must-see list.  Luckily, they are just as accessible for those looking for a quick mid-week meal to make back home.  Buon cibo!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Just a fabulous place. Wine, bread, lasagna, olives, etc ....best tiramisu I have ever eaten. Staff is friendly. Has become a favorite place to shop!"}
{"text":"Pasta & Provisions is amazing!  You really should go there, now.  Right now.  Everything from the homemade pasta, ready to eat salads and grilled veggies, the sauces, the meatballs, the wine selection and the focaccia.  It's pretty hard not to get wrapped up into buying every item they sell.  It's all so fresh and local, it's like a dream!  And let me tell you a little something about the focaccia.  On a recent trip to Asheville my uncle asked if I could pick him up two rounds of focaccia.  He said, \"they just don't make focaccia like that up here.\"  You know it's good when you're taking out of town requests.  The entire entity is where it's at!  Owner, Tommy George has really created a family atmosphere in this authentic shop.  I always walk away, with a pep in my step, feeling great about supporting this local business and of course, hungry.  The pasta literally melts in your mouth and the meatballs are the best I've ever had.  This food is perfect for dinner parties, big family meals and/or a quiet date night at home.  And, of course it's good for you!  Eat Pasta Run Fasta!"}
{"text":"Pasta & Provisions is very popular with the Yankees that have migrated to Charlotte.  I usually stopped at P & P to pickup fresh cheese and pasta on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This is everything the world needs: pasta, pizza, beer, wine, and a great patio! This takes me back to my travels in Italy with shelves stocked with imported pastas and olive oils. They even carry Abbracci Cookies!

The food they have on their daily menu is simple, but fresh and delicious. They have pastas (all homemade), pizzas, and sandwiches. The pasta has more flavor than you can imagine and it takes your taste-buds straight to Italy. I recently had the caprese sandwich and the mozzarella was perfect - very fresh!

The staff is also very friendly and the atmosphere is as casual as it gets. Show up in a dress, or in yoga pants.. no one cares. 

 I've never had a bad experience here and don't think I ever will."}
{"text":"So this one time, I applied for a job at P&P and I never got called back... However! Once I got over my grudge, I went back and was just plain giggly. The food is so darn artful. All of their imported products have the fancist Italian labels and I'm just a sucker for their Italian deli meats.. O the pepperoni! The staff is casual and friendly and always ready to make a recommendation. 

This is the place I go when I really want to make a Christmas-present good sandwich. The breads are little beauties and they don't get upset when I ask for 5 slices of three different meats! They also have nice weekly deals, especially on Fridays - bring your own container and get some free sauce! Haven't done that yet.. I try to throw down a little cash when I leave a store with something."}
{"text":"I came here on a trip with a few other girls. We had all never been there before and seeked pasta and sauce for a pasta dinner. The staff was incredibly helpful and told us exactly how much pasta and sauce we needed. We had the garlic and rosemary linguini with their homemade pomodoro and marinara sauce (mix 1 part pomodoro, 2 parts marinara). It was incredible! We also had meatballs which I highly recommend. For $20, we fed 5 hungry runners! You only have to boil the fresh pasta for 60-90 seconds so it was really fast too.

They have these little chocolates on a shelf called \"liquid coffee\" for $.75 that I got on a whim-SO amazing and now I have to find out where else I could find them!"}
{"text":"This fabulous little Italian market in Myers Park is literally one of my favorite things about Charlotte. Fresh pastas, sauces, a fabulous wine and craft beer selection, and the best cannolis in town -- it's like landing in the middle of Mulberry Street. Drop in on the way home and pick up a package of fresh tortellini and some marinara sauce, or a phenomenal eggplant parmesan, ready to pop in the oven. The prices are reasonable, and the staff is always friendly and helpful. Parking can be a little tight (especially in the early evening), but be patient -- the inconvenience is well worth it. Even if you're just stopping in for a cannoli or two."}
{"text":"The absolute best!!!! Cannot go wrong with P&P. I crave this meal several times a week and I love that the pasta takes 90 seconds to cook!"}
{"text":"Fresh pastas and Italian goods. This is the place were all top restaurants in Charlotte buys their fresh pastas."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, perfect location. We've eaten in and carried out (sandwiches, pasta, salads) and all have been delicious. One minor annoyance; they now charge a $5 \"corking fee\" for wine consumed on premise. I understand on/off premise pricing disparity but the fee seems trifling in a self-service joint. Maybe I'm just old and cranky....Go get some; you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"An all around great spot! Super friendly staff, great food that you can either eat in or take out. They have the absolute best fettuccine Alfredo I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my Fiance because we were craving pasta. I got garlic pasta with meatballs and he got pesto pasta with chicken. Both dishes tasted great and we will definitely be back again. I liked the fact that the pasta seemed home made and fresh! The bread was okay, but totally loved the rest of it. I would try this place out if you get the chance."}
{"text":"Thank You for a wonderful Valentines Day Dinner!!  This was my first experience with your take home dinners!  Wow!  What a tasty meal that was, \"I pretended that I worked hard\" but I did give you all of the credit!!  Will return soon!!"}
{"text":"We go here about twice a month and everything is great - we typically get the fresh pasta with sauce a but have ventured into the chicken parm, raviolis, etc.

Great way to make a romantic meal at home ready made in 30 min. The game changer is the Philly cheesesteak off the sand which menu - pick that up and carry it over to Brawley's next door for a pint and have yourself a nice little afternoon."}
{"text":"I was tempted to simply give this place 5 stars becuase it's one of the only of its kind in the Charlotte area and is right outside of uptown. But the food was great and the staff is very friendly. You have an assortment of meats, cheeses, canned goods and prepared meals at your disposal. There's also a bunch of traditional Italian deserts and packaged goods, as well as wine. Worth a visit if you appreciate typical italian food/cooking and live in the area."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. It brings the cook out in me. They have fresh pasta made in house or frozen. it is truly the best I've had. The employees are so helpful when it comes to any questions about prep and even have helpful suggestions. I know they have good fresh bread and other ingredients. I've had some of their pre-made stuff. The basil pesto is always a good pick, I added it to their pre-made 5 cheese ravioli. The chicken marsala was not so great last time I had it. I am looking forward to buying their lasagna next."}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome! Such a good vibe and super family friendly! Charlotte is better for p and p being around!"}
{"text":"Freshest pasta in Charlotte. I'm working my way through the different flavors now - started with the ravioli, then the egg spaghetti with marinara and so on, most recently the black pepper with pomodoro and meatballs -  and all taste so good you sort of just want to eat the pasta by itself. I adore pasta so I can't get away from that menu but my husband speaks highly of the sandwiches too. The patio is fun in the afternoon with a lot of people drinking beer and enjoying time outside with friends, kids, dogs...

Only complaints I have had: sometimes the pasta isn't well drained so there's a half-cup of water at the bottom of the bowl, and having ice available for drinks would be appreciated since not all of us are beer drinkers. 

Take home a loaf of bread for later and if you like olives? Theirs are super delicious."}
{"text":"This place is perfection.  You can order between different pasta/meat options, a sandwich, or get meats and pasta options to cook at home.  This place is so cute on the inside and has a surprisingly cozy patio out back.

You order at the front, get a buzzer, and sit where you would like.  We ordered the fettuccine with mushroom flavored noodles, Alfredo sauce, and chicken.  We also ordered the spinach ravioli with pesto add Parmesan.  Wine is reasonably priced and there is self-serve water dispenser, along with Parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, and oregano to take to your table.  I love this extra touch.

Our buzzer went off after about 7 minutes. Each pasta dish was in a bowl and both were so delicious.   They each came with a piece of bread.  Please let my pictures do the talking.... we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten in yet, but I've take away a few items from the grocery portion.  The ravioli was filled to capacity with fresh, flavorful ingredients. The sauces we tried - pomodoro and the creamy gorgonzola - were yummy.  The tomato was much better, the gorgonzola a bit over salted for my taste and perhaps not enough pungent gorgonzola flavor (needs just a touch more).  Look forward to returning for an in house made pizza or pasta dish for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest places you will set foot in. The most difficult part is getting there. Actually that isn't even true. Getting in is not the hard part. Getting out is the hard part, because the lot is so, so small, and you have to back out onto Providence Road when you leave. Let's skip that for now.

The good part is when you're inside it's like an old-time grocery, but instead of just about everything, it's focused on Italian food. Specifically pasta. You can get just about anything, and you place your order up front, and many times - though not all - they will zip your pasta from the back along a pasta zip line to the front. That alone is the price of admission (which to be fair, is free).

Though fresh pasta may not be worth the drive - or the maneuvering of the parking lot - it is definitely worth checking out the place. They also have all sorts of oils, wines, cheeses and the like. If you haven't gone, you owe it to yourself to visit at least once."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for prepared meals. I'm always so busy and it's hard to find time to make homemade meals so it's nice to have an option like this nearby. The only thing I would love to see more of is gluten-free options. I realize it's an Italian and pasta themed place, but there are lots of gluten free options now even for pasta, sauces, etc. 

But still overall, great place for the most part."}
{"text":"Yup, I am in love with Pasta & Provisions. Not just because they have freshly piped cannolis, but also because they have such a great selection of fresh Italian fare and ingredients. Plus, the employees are ridiculously nice and helpful.

Their fridge selection has all sorts of delicious traditional, home-made Italian goodies: meatballs & marinara, stuffed jumbo shells, lasagna, tiramisu, fresh pasta, etc. If your seeking specialty Italian items - this is the place to go. They have special canned tomatoes, imported pastas, wines, cheeses, etc. that will elevate your dish to the next level. They also offer large scale meals and catering for the \"I'm pretending I can cook Italian\" dinner parties. :)

And back the cannolis...holy yum, this is the first place in Charlotte where I've found fresh cannolis...if only I could convince them to make them with pistachios! Mmmm thanks, Pasta & Provisions! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful artisan store. Lots of choices in cheese,wine, sauces, ravioli,prepared meals,and fresh cut pasta to just how thick you like it.
I love the chicken piccata, meatballs, mushroom ravioli,and fresh linguine.
The staff is friendly and happy to help. Nice selection of canned and jars of preserved imported items."}
{"text":"As a P&P Myers Park regular, had always wondered why they didn't make sandwich's so...Voila! The Park Road outlet now does and it's not a bad sandwich to boot. Got the Italian (being a devoted Philly Italian Hoagie guy) and it hit all the right notes (the exception being the smaller, square shaped roll- good quality bread but the ingredients overwhelmed the roll) sharp provolone, Italian cold cuts and a pretty good basil aioli. Add on hot peppers and a sweet pepper relish and it's a pretty darn good $7.95 sandwich. Well done!"}
{"text":"We went for our first time tonight and the food was delicious. One thing that made this menu great was that you could mix and match - for example, my husband and I both got ravioli but I had cheese ravioli with pomodoro sauce and he had chicken ravioli with pesto. We both got added veggies. It was all super fresh and the staff was friendly and quick. When we asked what veggies they had they told us bell peppers and onions. After they started making our food, one of the guys came out and said they realized they also had artichoke hearts if we wanted to add those in which I appreciated the offer. Also big bonus in my book - they had reusable glasses for the water and proper silverware. I love it when restaurants don't run around disposables because they are so wasteful so it was refreshing to see this! They have a great little shop too with pasta that looked amazing. We got a back to take home for later. The food was delicious, the service was quick and friendly, and the price was pretty reasonable! We will definitely be back to try other things!"}
{"text":"So impressed. Fast fresh pasta and salads and sandwiches. Eat in or on patio or to go. What a slam dunk good place. Nothing quite like it. Not a lot of room to eat in , mainly a take out / to go deal. But man is it the right type of place for great pick up on park Rd. All pastas and sauces and such are house made. Nothing from the big food companies delivered in. Check it out for sure."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING.  It's such a cute shop and I had never heard of it before and thankfully a coworker had brought me there.  They sell a ton of things in the store like bread, pizza, wine, noodles, cheese, desserts, beer, etc.  I was extremely interested in their frozen food.  I ended up getting the stuffed shells meal and the lasagna.  Both had the directions to cook them.  The instructions were super easy to follow and the results were amazing!  I've tried a lot of Italian restaurants, but they had the absolute best stuffed shells and lasagna I have ever had!  I highly recommend coming to this place,  I can't wait to come back!  No need to spend a ton of money and go out to eat when you can have the best fine dining Italian food right at home."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Food is great and the customer service is even better. Every time my husband and I go in there everybody working in there is awesomely nice!!! They have wine, beer and plenty of options in the freezer for meals to take home for the nights you don't feel like cooking. The patio is awesome too. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely have nothing bad to say about this place!!!! Amazing!!! Food is always on point!!! Now I can never go back to box paste again!!! Thank you so much for amazing food and outstanding customer service!!! We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are so delicious! I had one of the best veggie sandwiches there I ever had in my life! There is a cute outdoor seating area and limited window seating inside. They have a good sized parking lot and is easy to get in and out of."}
{"text":"Very awesome place that we just came across as we were craving a cannoli.  But definitely check out all their fresh pasta (look at the sign on the counter for the types and cuts) and all the frozen dinners ready to go."}
{"text":"So glad this gem came to our neighborhood! The food is amazing. We are particularly fond of the pizzas and the amazing staff. In the summer we love the King of Pops freezer and enjoying those Popsicles on the patio. The beer on tap is great and the wine selection is wonderful. There are also grocery items that we haven't found since our trip to Italy that we can now keep in rotation. Stop by when you can. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved Pasta & Provisions from the first time I visited them at there other location but NOW I really love them in their second location!!! They have arrived in Madison Park and that is exactly where I live!

I've been to this location three time but failed write a review.  Me, hubs, and the poo-dell (my dog Valentino who is a poodle..hahaha) walked from our house to Pasta & Provisions.  The goal was to order food there and then walk it across the street to Brawley's.  Score.  I ordered a sandwich and a shrimp Kale salad and both were great!! What's really cool is that I ordered a glass of wine to sip on while I waited for my food.  There is an area where they open this garage door and there is a high top area that has bar stools which is awesome.  

Now that it's nice weather and their patio area is open, it's so great!  Go and grab a beer or a glass of wine and order food and sit out back, or take the food to go and walk across to Brawley's.  Such a win win for both of them....but not much of a win win for my waistline.  Who cares...hahaha totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Been here for 2 1/2 years and it took me that ;;long to visit.  A friend of mine used them for a dinner party and it was so awesome.  

Great selection of prepared pasta dinners, olive oils and wines, cheeses,  bread...the list goes on and on.  

My only thing is trying to get in and out of the; parking lot.  It's a tight squeeze and not the easiest to back out when you have an SUV. :(  There has to be another parking space??"}
{"text":"Whether it's a family dinner, a huge holiday feast, or a quiet date night, they never disappoint. With the freshest stuff, coolest wines, unique pastas, and prepared sauces and noodles, you cannot go wrong. Such a great spot."}
{"text":"I have to admit that the name Pasta and Provisions doesn't sound very appetizing. I've driven by here many times thinking it was some sort of grocery store that only sold pasta. Well boy am I glad I was wrong. This place has some delicious sandwiches and drinks. 

I got the Italian sandwich. I am told it is the must have choice here. My wife got the pork belly sandwich which had a fried egg on it.

They also have a great patio out back that lets you kick your Uggs up and enjoy the outside air. The staff was friendly AF and really showed us the ropes on how to order. They have these delicious chips from New Orleans that I've never tried before as well.

I sat with my wife drinking kombucha in the fall air and thinking about the future. The crisp breeze was just cold enough to make me wish I had worn a jacket but not cold enough to make me go inside. I thought about how good life has been to me in the past year. And I am so thankful. And much like the leaves changing colors on the trees I too am ready to go with the flow of the next phase of my life. Whatever that may be. 

We are all connected. Yes, even the two dudes in suits who chose to sit at the big round table we were already sitting at. Like it's totally cool ya'll didn't even ask or anything. That's fine. Like I said we're all in this together.

The food at Pasta and Provisions is so good and the atmosphere is so cozy. This place is like Uggs for your soul."}
{"text":"Great Italian provisions , healthy yet tasty lunch options, and ALWAYS playing awesome music."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Not fancy at all. Don't let the looks deceive you. The best noodles I've EVER had. You don't pay for the presentation, waiters with long wait aprons nor the décor. You pay for good food.  You can order from their menu and they call your name when your order is ready. Limited seating inside but I was told they do have a nice patio in warmer weather.  Beer and wine is available. They also have a nice olive oil for sell, a decent wine selection, and homemade frozen food selection."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced pasta made fresh and dishes that are customizable...what more can you ask for?  This was my first time visiting after hearing a lot of buzz about it from my coworkers.  I was craving shrimp scampi (they do not sale this dish) but, the roasted garlic noodles with pomodoro sauce was pretty delish.  My pasta was delicious but, the fresh tomatoes in the sauce was the main attraction for me.  The staff was super nice and patient and the food was ready pretty quickly.  They also have a great list of sandwiches and prepared meals to go.  I will definitely be back again to explore this menu and think up some cool combinations and meals."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on Mother's Day for a lunch.  I had been wanting to try it for some time.  I had the meatball sub which was delicious.  The meatballs tasted so good!!!  The bread had a little bit of a burnt taste, but I'm not sure why.  The meatballs made up for it.  The pasta I tried was garlic parm flavor with marinara.  The noodles were a little hard & chewy, perhaps just a few more minutes cooked or even one more would have been better.  I love an al dente pasta, and I know what al dente is, but this just wasn't there yet. The wine by the glass is very tiny, but cute.  The patio was amazing!! I don't know if you can buy bottles here & drink them, but something I'd love to do.  The staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is to die for! I love it. Very high quality ingredients.  A lot of time and effort is put into this shop.  I will keep coming back for as long as they will have me! Best Italian food around! Great service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Is the amazing array of Italian imported oils, pastas, cheeses, wines, canned and jarred veggies and such more expensive than your average high-end grocery store? Yeah.

Does it cost more to buy their made-in-house spaghettini or ravioli than HT's failed attempts? Of course.

But who cares. Everyone that works here is awesome, you can taste almost anything in the cold case before purchasing, open kitchen in the back so you can watch, if you tire of shopping...it's an impressive little store that deserves the extra buck or two. Or three. Hell, maybe even four.

Lately (for you meaters) they've branched out and have started stocking Grateful Grower's sausage and some other hard-to-find NC fine meats, as well as their standard Italian selection.

There's also a fridge with sauces, pastas, etc in the P/M Common Market, if you don't feel like making the drive down Providence, and the parking kinda sucks... but go at least once. Rad little store."}
{"text":"My husband and I love pasta provisions! Fresh pasta and multiple fresh sauces, how can you go wrong. I recommend the garlic rosemary pasta if you are going for the fresh to order. If your looking for ravioli the mushroom is amazing!!! I always get the Pomodoro sauce because it has a little bit of kick to it! We also get the Rosemary focaccia bread to go with it!  

The parking at the providence location is a little tough to get in and out of, but when you go just get a bunch of items to stalk up your freezer! 

I haven't been to the new location on park road, but I hear great things! It will be my next stop when I need some more pasta!"}
{"text":"It's pretty sad when the new location is right across the street from my work and because of the employees I will drive out of my way to go to the providence road location. I went in looking for recommendations for different sauce and pasta combinations and one employee gave me nothing but sarcasm and attitude when I asked about different sauces available. Then acted as if I was crazy for asking a question as if his personal conversation with another employee was much more important. Such a sad start to a new location"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to pick up authentic meals, fresh pasta, cheese, wine... Cannoli's are great and the staff is always super nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've never had anything that I did not like here. I typically get the vodka sauce and just regular marinara sauce for my pasta."}
{"text":"This is the best pasta I've had outside of Italy. They are incredibly helpful in assisting you in picking out your pasta and are very friendly. 

We got the pesto sauce with lemon pepper noodles and the pomodoro sauce with garlic rosemary noodles. We also got the french dip sandwich. Everything was incredibly delicious. We got the stuffed cookies for dessert and I also tried the Updog apple pie kambucha which were all great. 

You get your food fast and can either way there at the bar or on the heated patio outside it get it to go. 

We will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"The Deli. Oh, the Deli!

I had just finished a beer at Brawley's across the street and knew we needed dinner, so I walked over. My husband ordered the meatball sub, and I tried the pork belly sandwich. The staff was very kind and helpful with their recommendations. Both sandwiches were excellent! (I liked my pork belly the best!) The egg and arugula were the perfect compliments to the perfectly cooked pork belly.

This place is also home to a ton of homemade pasta and sauces there for take home. I have only done this once, but I would like to do it more. 

I even checked out the patio out back, which is a hidden gem. They have made a lovely space with hanging lanterns, etc out back that is an awesome place to enjoy a sandwich or any beer off their menu."}
{"text":"After getting fresh made pasta from here I don't know if I can ever go back. It is the best pasta I have ever had. We bought 3/4 lb of garlic and parsley linguine. It was plenty to feed 2 adults. If you aren't planning on stuffing yourself it could probably feed 2 adults and a child or possibly even 3 adults who don't eat as much. We also got the pomodoro sauce and a pack of 6 frozen meatballs as well as a baguette. Everything was delicious. Best meatballs I've ever had, best baguette, best sauce. All of this you bring home and prepare yourself. It is more expensive than store bought but cheaper than a restaurant. We paid about $15 for everything. Well worth the price for how amazing everything was!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm totally violating my rule of not reviewing a place until after I go there multiple times, but come on, how can this place get any better? Driving back from errands one night, The Lady requests that I pick up Pasta Primavera from Portofinos. Fine choice, but I want something a little bit different. Decide that it would be a perfect opportunity to stop right up the road and check out Pasta & Provisions. 
First off, it's a pretty full Italian market. They have a dry-goods section, a deli, and fridges/freezers for all wet things. Most of it is imported, which is super cool. I got super lucky, and their daily special was pretty much a pasta primavera (score) for $7, and I ordered the turkey sandwich for myself, $7 again. The first thing I noticed was that the cooks were cooking with skillets right there in front of me, how much fresher food could you make? Everything was done to-order and fresh, and the taste really reflected that. 
I overheard a family order a couple of cannolis, which I missed upon first glance of the menu. True to italian style, the cannolis are filled to-order and dipped in either chocolate chips or pistachios. I didn't really have a difficult decision to make, I'll take 2 small ones (for $1.25 each!) Absolutely delicious. 
They have a killer patio out back as well where lots of families were hanging out, plus they do have taps, so you can hang out for a while! We'll be hitting up this place a lot more now that we know about the incredible gem it is. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"You can shop here for fresh pasta and related groceries like cheese, olives and sauce as well as eat some food in the outdoor patio(very cute and cozy) There is a small bar table inside as well. I ordered spaghetti with meatball on pomodoro sauce. I liked the tender and springy texture of handmade spaghetti and beef and pork mixed meatball was great with pomodoro sauce. Also all staffs were very kind to answer your all question. Definitely will try different pasta next time!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte a long time and have never been here, I have been missing out. Great little shop with amazing pasta and sauces... I was eyeing the pizza which I will definately pick up on another visit. Everybody was so friendly and helpful... I even got a free pound of pasta since it was my first visit!"}
{"text":"Love P&P! They offer fresh pasta & sauces, along with so many other food options. One thing I love, they offer Boars Head deli meat, sliced to your choice..great for sandwiches. A true Italian gem in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Can't beat fresh pasta and sauce.  I only entered their store/grocery on the left side,but my experience was great.  We got some fresh take home and cook yourself  pasta and sauce. All of which was amazingly tasty. 

 They have lots of different premade Italian food that your can purchase and take home with you.    

Breads, cheeses, and meats all looked like a quality selection. I'll be back to try more of their selection."}
{"text":"Man do I love this place. They have my favorite sandwiches in the city - the Caprese is the standard for me but the new Royal is I think the best sandwich I have ever tasted. They toast the bread on the sides making it crisp and warm and the mixture of the meats, cheeses, and sauces are just delicioso. Mama mia.

I also love the outdoor seating area, as well as the beer selection (both cans and 5 on draft) and the kombucha and cold brew on tap. But the best part is how the deli area feels like a New Jersey deli I grew up with, with homemade sauces and soups, as well as meats and pastas and breads you can grab to try your hand at making food as good as P&P's and failing. Excellente. Thank you."}
{"text":"*Advanced apologies for this being so long! :)
\"Sono nell'amore\" - I'm in love!  I wanted to burst into a child-like conniption right on the floor because I couldn't buy one (or more) of everything...someone hold me.  But I digress!  This is a FANTASTIC little shop - a lotta stuff packed in a small space & it seems to be quite popular.  Parking was a smidge daunting, but there is more in the back...but be careful since the tiny ally only allows for one car & you might get in the \"I'm trying to leave but no I'M trying to come in\" face-off!  The rear lot is shared with Providence Sundries & was pretty full when I was there around 12:30ish on a Thursday.

Found the staff to be SUPER helpful, friendly & knowledgeable, especially as to which sauce would pair well with what pasta (all homemade in house btw)- one girl (didn't catch her name) offered to show me around the store & explain things when she learned it was my first time in, which was a huge help (although the shop is relatively small it's still kind of overwhelming at first).  Once the tour was over I wandered about on my own to soak it all in.  The atmosphere is easy with music playing in the background at juuust the right volume and a view to the kitchen in the back.  One cool thing they do is whenever someone orders any of their fresh pasta, they send it sailing from the kitchen to the register up front down a long wire attached to a clip (watch your head!) - FUN!   PS - you choose how you want your pasta cut: Angel Hair, Spaghetti, Linguine or Fettuccine.

They have a huge menu board up front that spells out exactly what's in each pasta, ravioli and sauce, so you know just what you're getting.  Plus you see how NATURAL everything is.

I walked away with THE most delicious Greek White Bean Spread & loaf of Rosemary Focaccia bread (which I am munching on as we speak)...just marvelous.  Also picked up a pound of fresh garlic/rosemary pasta cut fettuccini style (only 2 mins to cook!), house-made alfredo and pomodoro sauces, and a pound of shrimp ravioli (prebagged).  They even gave me a treat just b/c it was my first time there - how awesome is THAT?!   They're my new bestest friends :)

For those SIX, local, house-made items, my total came to $30 and change.   Taking into account I was supporting a local business and getting true FRESH items, made BY those locals, I don't think that was half bad.  One other thing I like about P&P is that their prices are fixed & do not fluctuate as they see fit any given day like many other places of this type, and from what I could gather (didn't ask, so..) everything is always available - they even give you a \"menu\" when you check out.  This is especially handy if you're trying to plan for a special dinner or get-together.  

True, you are gonna pay more than you would at the grocery store, and at times quite a bit more, but it really IS worth it (especially for many of the \"provisions\").  Once we've munched on the pastas & sauces I'll update this.  But as of this moment in time I'm drooling over my newfound love.  Everyone should visit P&P at least once, especially if you love to cook, play in the kitchen, or even just browse & get ideas for a simple meal for two since they're more they happy to help.  OH...and they have very reasonable hours, including Saturday AND Sunday!!!  See you there :)"}
{"text":"This has been on my list for far too long. Our friends treated us to some of PP homemade pasta a few months ago when we had them over for dinner. Hot Damn, it was good. The other day I stopped in to grab some pasta for myself. Pulling into the parking lot I spotted a \"R\" Rutgers sticker on a fellow car, of course.
This place is packed with Italian deliciousness. It reminded me a lot of Italian delis I'm used to up North. This shop is a little fancier than normal. From my short trip, They have everything you would need. I'll have to come back next time I want some pre-made meals, they looks amazing!

I grabbed some fresh pasta made with rosemary and basil- about 5.50 enough for 4 large meals of pasta. I'm glad I finally made at trip to visit this little deli."}
{"text":"Small store/deli tucked right between a street lined with homes. We almost missed the place! I was looking for cannoli and that's just what I got. They fill them on the spot to order which is the only way to go. I wouldn't come all the way out here again just for cannoli but it was worth a spot. They sell prepared foods, sandwiches, pastas, wine like other reviews have mentioned."}
{"text":"Their homemade pasta is great! There's a 3-4 step process when ordering. First you choose your pasta flavor, I like rosemary garlic. Second, choose your pasta style like linguini, spaghetti, or fettuccine. Third choose your sauce, they have Alfredo, Pomodoro and marinara. Then fourth, you can add meat! Bon appétit! 
When the weather is nice they open the big garage doors and you can sit at the bar. They have a small outdoor patio where you can brings dogs and sit at a round table that has a tree planted in the middle"}
{"text":"Our first time here.
What a great experience.
Bought a pound of basil fettuccine to bring home for dinner.
So excited.
Everyone was super nice."}
