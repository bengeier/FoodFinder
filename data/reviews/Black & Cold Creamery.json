Milkshakes and sandwiches too!! And for my celiac/gluten sensitive friends! This place has been such a happy place! All flavors are labled.  Staff is fully trained for allergy needs.  There is no lack of options! The staff is always so friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Love, love this gem of a local business.  They have the best milkshakes, and on our most recent visit, we tried the paninis, too!  My pick, the Larry Special featured chicken, bacon, garlic aoili and more, and my husband had the veggie panini which he gave two-thumbs up. The staff is super friendly and helpful.  There are not a lot of food options in this area and this one is definitely worth it! Great prices and yummy food!"}

{"text":"This is a hidden gem here in west mifflin. You walk in to a warm welcome and samples of your favourite Ice cream. And all of them are awesome. And try a panini while your there. I had a turkey and basil pesto it was amazing. For three cones and a panini my total was 11$ was very impressed with the amount of items i got for my money. Will be going back for sure"}
{"text":"The first time the weather was above 50 degrees in 2017, we were out on an ice cream date. I like searching the city for new ice cream spots (& coffee spots). I had black and cold creamery bookmarked and since we were already in homestead, we decided to head up here.

The shop itself is adorable. The front area has a bench and a few high stools with a counter. It is decorated so cute. The shop is absolutely adorable and humble.

They serve Hershey's ice cream. I ordered peanut butter pretzel (pb ice cream with chocolate covered pretzel pieces) and a cinnamon swirl flavor (think cinnamon toast crunch). I ordered this in a waffle cone. My bf went with the same peanut butter pretzel I ordered plus a coffee flavor. We sat In the front and enjoyed our ice cream date.

the girl working the counter was very kind and offered great suggestions.

The shop also sells soup, Paninis, coffee, tea ect. The also serve coffee over ice cream (black & cold) 

I loved this ice cream shop. I hope to see them soon at a yelp event as a vendor. They deserve a lot of recognition. Support small business!"}
