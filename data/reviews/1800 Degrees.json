{"text":"This place is not NEARLY worth the money.  We went here on recommendation from a friend for my wife's birthday. I must say that for the price I was shocked at how thin the rib steak was. $65 for a steak that was not even 2 cm thick. Also you would think that a \"classy\" \"fancy\" steakhouse would know how to cook a steak. Steaks ordered medium came out well done (at least). I would rather go to the keg, save $100 and get a better quality dinner than this place could offer. Black angus, down the street is cheaper and better by far. Save your money and do not go to 1800."}
{"text":"This was the first and last time I will dine at 1800 degrees.

From the beginning, starting with our greeting at the door, service was cold and uninviting. At a price of around $50-80/person for dinner, one expects to be treated at least half decently.

I ordered a NY Striploin Steak, my girlfriend ordered the black cod filet, with a few oysters to share to start. The oysters arrived almost immediately, and we were off to a good start. Then things went downhill: we waited 50 minutes for our entrees, and were incredible famished when they arrived.

My steak was smaller than expected, but looked decent. I ordered it medium rare, and the outside was nice and charred, but when I cut into the meat, it was raw! - I'm talking cold on the inside, fresh from the fridge - totally blue rare, steak tatare! And this was a $50 steak, so naturally I wanted it cooked the way I had ordered it.

It seemed as if they had rushed to make our orders, which was unacceptable considering they had almost an hour to get it right.

The waitress took the steak away and said they'd fix it, leaving behind my side of fries, to munch on while I waited.

She then brought back THE SAME steak, now more cooked, now alone on a plate without a side dish or the demi glace it had originally come with. It was a sorry looking meal, but it had now been about an hour and 10 minutes since my original order and I was starving, so I dug in.

After my first bite, I was horrified to discover a long black hair underneath the meat, and I immediately called over the server. She apologized and took away the plate. To my surprise the manager returned a few minutes later with the same plate, and told me it was not in fact a hair, but caramelized beef jus! 

This was all too much now; it had been an hour and 20 and I had only had a few fries and an oyster or two to hold me. I let the manager know  about the ordeal; the long wait, the raw steak, the hair, the lack of a side dish and sauce when the meal was replated. His blankface response was: \"well you already ate your side fries, why would I give you another?\"  I ate those damn fries while I was waiting for you to get my hour late $50 steak right, buddy, so I think it's only within reason that I get my entree back with a fresh side and some demi glace, plated the way it was supposed to be, instead of a sad little twice grilled naked steak alone on a plate.

Not to mention he tried to convince me I was mistaken about finding a large black hair in my food!

That was it, my girlfriend had long finished her meal (which was blah by the way) and I still hadn't eaten anything, but I couldn't deal with this jerk any longer.

I asked for the cheque, minus the steak of course, and that was that. No  apology from the manager, no free drink or dessert offers, no comped meals, just an empty stomach and the knowledge I would never return.

We went across the street to Tim Horton's and I got a sandwich. The service, food and atmosphere were a million times better."}
{"text":"Took us 75min before we got our entrees, and we ordered within first 5 minutes. 

French onion soup came out lukewarm 2 0min after ordering. One of the oysters was off in freshness. 

Mains were all pretty good, the gnocchi in the New Zealand lamb was delicious. Also had the filet mignon and special halibut. I'd give all three dishes between 7.5-8.5

Server was friendly and ambience was nice."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Food and service was wonderful. This was our fifth or sixth time here and it has never dissapointed. Have the lobster mac and cheese!  Delish. The potato galette that comes with the steaks is the best i have ever had, and i'm a chef!  I dont give praises lightly."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times. Each time the food was excellent. The service is very good. All my requests were granted.  The kitchen hit the mark on all the steaks and seafood. My only complaint is they occasionally struggle to get things out in time. Nice choice for the kingsway."}
{"text":"Stay away from 1800 Degrees!!!  I went there with my boyfriend and sister to celebrate my birthday.  We placed our orders and when it came, I noticed that my order and my boyfriend's order looked identical. Given we ordered 2 different steak meals, I knew something was wrong.   I ordered the prime rib eye and he ordered the New York strip so they shouldn't have looked like the same meal.  I told the server who gave a blank stare and then we were told that he could keep the WRONG meal for the same price as he was supposed to pay. In other words, STILL pay $39 for the wrong steak. 

My boyfriend refused and so they said they'd make him the correct meal.  So here were the 3 of us and my sister and I were left to eat with my boyfriend watching. It was VERY uncomfortable.  My sister asked for the manager while we ate.  We finished our meals and his food wasn't yet served. In the meantime, we were SUPPOSED to share a lobster mac and cheese (though finding lobster in it was rare) and mushrooms. My sister and I took our share but my boyfriend's was left getting cold, waiting for his meal.  When my boyfriend's meal finally came, his fries were flooded with salt and that apple dessert was disgusting.  We had to watch him eat and that was uncomfortable too.

The manager thought what happened was totally fine. In fact, he called my sister and I rude for speaking up for what happened.  We were far from rude.  He told us never to return, which was unnecessary because we had no intention of ever going there again.  In my entire life, no restaurant ever told me to never return.  The fact that he insulted us for THEIR mistake, made it even more offensive.   I contacted the owner and he did nothing.  

If you are looking to ruin a celebration or for a nice night out to turn nasty, go to this restaurant. If not, stay away!!!

Reply to Gary S's comment below (he seems to have removed it since it was deceptive and I addressed his issues below. I'll keep this on in case he puts it back on): 

We were not rude or abusive in any way.  We did tell them of their mistake and unlike what Gary said, his feeling was that my boyfriend paying $39 for the wrong steak was fine.  There was a party near our seats and they weren't even aware of what happened. Had Gary been telling the truth, they would have noticed.

The free dessert for me alone was prearranged and had nothing at all to do with what happened. It was a celebration for my birthday and I told them about that free dessert offer elsewhere so the owner John Pappas prearranged it.  As with all the errors made there, I had to explain all that at the restaurant even though I wasn't supposed to have to. In other words, they messed up our arrangement for a free dessert. Incidentally that apple dessert was like oatmeal.  Stay away from it too. 

I did not throw anything at the window.  I had a touch of food left over since my boyfriend didn't want to eat the cold side dishes that 1800 degrees didn't rewarm.  I decided not to have any reminders of such a bad experience. I merely dropped it on the street. I never did that before but I didn't want to go back into the restaurant to give it to them.  I didn't see a garbage can nearby. Perhaps I should have taken it and thrown it in the trash like it belonged. I'm sorry about that."}
{"text":"1800 Degrees has a great sounding menu and great high quality steaks.  The lobster poutine is about the most delicious thing on earth.  Service is a little pretentious so you have to bring your sense of humour along.  Wildly expensive, but worth the splurge for a great meal."}
{"text":"tWe had a great experience last Friday at 1800 degrees!  I was a bit uncertain given the average reviews of the restaurant, but emerged pleasantly surprised at the overall experience. 

The service was great. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the wine list, which was a great selection of wines from across the world.  This is very rare for Toronto, I think...most waiters have NO idea about wine and often pretend.  So, this was pretty impressive.

The appetizers were pretty average. The steak tartar was a weird concoction of steak with a bernaise-type sauce. It was OK (the search for a really good tartar in Toronto continues....).  The caesars salads were pretty average as well. Good, but nothing too exciting.

The steaks were cooked to perfection in terms of their temperature and were accompanied with some nicely presented vegetables and some yummy onion rings.

We are excited that there is a more upscale, modern restaurant in Etobicoke for a nice Friday night dinner treat that has a decent wine list.  Good on ya, 1800 degrees!"}
