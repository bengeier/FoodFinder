{"text":"I would definitely come back here. I ordered the green chili burro and my husband ordered the bean and cheese burro. Each one is large enough for two meals. The tortillas are delicious and the filling is just as good. They have a chip and salsa bar with perfectly salted chips and amazing salsa. I highly recommend Los Patos 2."}
{"text":"Holy AUTHENTIC!!!!! I've been meaning to check this place out since they opened and I finally had the chance to today..  I literally just put my fork down and had to come on here to write this review.. 

Guys! The food is amazing! I ordered the cheese enchilada plate with green sauce, rice and refried beans and it did not disappoint. I know what you're thinking \"cheese enchiladas, really?\" YES REALLY! These aren't just any cheese enchiladas, I'm pretty sure God himself morphed into the chef to create the recipe. The green sauce is full of flavor, but at the same time not too spicy... There is just enough kick, happy-medium if you will. It's not the spice level that is guaranteed to leave you running to the nearest restroom, shrieking in pain, whilst you clench your butthole in preparation of the impending fiery abyss that is sure to erupt at any given moment.... No sir (ma'am, or whatever you identify as I'm not here to judge) that will not happen. So don't get your hopes up if your cure-all for constipation is overly-spicy food. 


And the beans! Oh my GOD the beans! They do not serve you the run of the mill everyday refried beans. These refried beans are majestic, something from a fairytale or better yet a unicorns mouth! Seriously, they are like something I've never had before. They danced their way into my belly like a party in my mouth. I'm not much of a rice person, but theirs is definitely edible. I typically don't eat Mexican rice but I shoveled at least four mouthfuls down. 

Oh, and the service is great too! Sure, it's not the trendy style restaurants that millennials thrive on, but who cares?! The restaurant is family owned, the staff is extremely friendly and the food is amazing! I can't wait until I'm hungry again to go back. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food, that is sure to make you craving more. 


GO.CHECK.IT.OUT! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is right by my work and thank goodness they opened. This is a father and son business where Martha use to be.

Tuesday they have Taco Tuesday for $1 a taco.
Wednesday is 3 rolled tacos for $2.50.

The Carne Asada tacos are super yummy. We even tried the \"homemade chorizo\" which is actually in a different name but if you ask the gentleman when you walk in, he will be able to tell you which ones that is.

Today I tried their steak torta and it smacked my tastebuds with flavor. A lot of my coworkers LOVE their chimi and will swear by it that it's their favorite. 

Their salsa we believe is homemade. We found tiny chunks of little avocados at the bottom of the green salsa. The chips are made fresh. Always nice and toasty when we bag them.

Overall I really appreciate the family business. Definitely see them going somewhere and making better business than the previous."}
{"text":"Came in here today right after my sons swimming around 6:30pm. Got a carnitas burrito and chicken quesadillas, I always love Mexican food. But I think this was the worst Mexican food I had so far. The carnitas burrito was not good at all, seems like the carnitas tasted old and a lil hard too. The chicken quesadilla was not good either. Lady in the cashier was nice though, but I'm not impressed about the food at all. Im not the pickiest customer out there, I eat anything but this one didn't make me want to eat there again."}
{"text":"I had tacos and rice. Both very very good and fast service. I didn't know it but it was taco Tuesday so they where only 1.00!"}
{"text":"Tuesday's for Taco Tuesday's are the best! $1 for tacos! The staff is so friendly and the tacos are delicious. Definitely need to try their pastor and carne asada tacos. Chips are free with every order."}
{"text":"Los Patos 2 is a a small mexican restaraunt located in a strip mall. We decided to walk down there as it is very close to our house. There was a large TV in the sitting area playing upbeat Mexican music. There is a large variety of selections to choose from on the menu. My husband and I chose the shrimp burro to share.
The burrito was large and was filled with large shrimp, lettuce and rice. The tortilla was grilled amd was crispy amd delicious. They sell soda in a bottle/can and did not have diet. So we went without a drink. My recommendation would be to share your meal with someone or save some for leftovers as the portions are large. They offer free chips and salsa as well. We will walk down again when we want a quick bite of Mexican food."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Staff was friendly and the place was clean. Food was served on paper plates and foil pans and tasted \"ok\". It's more of a take-out place. Probably won't go back again"}
{"text":"OMG I'M SO FULL!!!!! \"Cut it in half, Taerra and save half for tomorrow\". I said that to myself a dozen times as I literally inhaled the whole burrito. Guess that was lunch, dinner, and breakfast for the next 24 hours. 

When people say that hole in the wall restaurants are some of the best, listen to them! This is next to a gas station and family run. Homemade salsas (a friggin salsa bar!!), fresh chips, and probably the best carnitas burrito I've ever had come from this gem of a restaurant. Huge chunks of marinated pork, with cilantro, onions and a sexy chili verde wrapped in a delicious tortilla will have me coming back weekly.  The customer service was welcoming and super friendly. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"The best food  I've ever ate in my life!!! Delicious staff is so friendly  also a family operated restaurant  !"}
{"text":"The worst food I've ever eaten, the place smells bad inside, and they don't have diet drinks or any drinks except the ones in glass bottles and they are 2 dollars each!!! The enchiladas were gross with no sauce on them!!! I wouldn't recommend this place to eat and I wouldn't eat here if it were the last place on earth!!!!"}
{"text":"No bueno. My torta milenesa was burnt. My mom's enchiladas had no filling. At all. Just tortillas dipped in sauce with cheese on top. (Unfortunately we got it to go, so we couldn't send it back.) The only redeeming feature was the excellent churro. Cinnamon-y deliciousness."}
{"text":"This business recently opened where Martha's Kitchen used to be. Located in a small strip mall on the corner of Higley rd. and Southern rd. this quaint little restaurant serves authentic Mexican food. Today my curiosity got the best of me as I live almost across the street. I stopped in for lunch on taco Tuesday. The special is 12 rolled tacos for $10.99. I thought this was going to be a small menu, but to my delight it is pretty extensive. They offer free chips and salsa while you wait for your order. You can watch Telemundo on the TV or listen to Spanish music in the background.
I ordered a carnita burro. For me I rate a Mexican restaurant based on the quality of their burrito. Tacos are pretty standard, but burritos can vary greatly. Now if I know any Spanish at all, Burrito would be a small burro. Here they are called burros for a good reason. The one I got was nearly a foot long and weighed at least a pound. It was very warm and hard to hold on to. The burro was filled with grilled steak, rice, beans, and garnished with cilantro. It was not highly seasoned for people with sensitive palates, but there is a condiment stand where you can spice it up as I did. 
I don't know much about the business except that they have another store at 415 E. McKellips in Mesa. I like this place. It's good food right in my backyard. I hope this one stays around a while as businesses in this location come and go."}
