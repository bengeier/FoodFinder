{"text":"GCBC is great! All of the employees are happy, great customer service! Drinks are consistent. Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. I love the energy the students give. You can tell they love what they're doing while they're doing it. Music selection is exceptional. Definitely my favorite place to go to when I'm on campus"}
{"text":"For those who care to wonder why I give this place five stars here is why. Yes their lines are fairly long for some parts of the day(rush hours). Yes their coffee is not Starbucks. Yes they only have 7 or so workers making dozens of drinks at a time. Given these circumstances GCBC does a pretty good job. The average wait time is 5 minutes to order and 5-10 minutes to get your drink and/or food. This may seem like a while but upon realizing that the workers are all students trying to make a huge amount of orders it make sense that they are not as quick as Starbucks would be.   In regards to their coffee, tea, and food items I would give them a 4.5/5. The only reason being is that on 3 occasions they have forgotten to make my order and I had to go tell them about it. In response I was given my drink as well as some other item to make up for it.  Now the atmosphere of coffee shops is one that I have always loved. Background music, plenty of seating, great lighting, and just a wonderful environment. GCBC matches all of these and while the music genre may change a bit in response to who is working and thus controlling the music, it does not change the atmosphere. I come here to do homework, do devotions, and just relax.   In the case that this GCBC does not suit you, the other one at Roadrunner Apartments might be more accommodating to you."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Always able to find somewhere to work & always able to find a great drink! Definitely a good environment for either socializing or working alone! 5/5 stars forsure!"}
{"text":"Really terrible coffee! Long lines that aren't worth it. Tea is good but pricy for what it is."}
{"text":"Here trying to do homework and relax. They are blasting hip hop. Who plays hip hop at a coffee shop?? The ambience and furniture is awesome."}
