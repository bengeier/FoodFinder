{"text":"After a day of Pokemon hunting.  This is a perfect place to take a break. Exceptionally nice cafe hidden just off Main Street, it's a gem that most people would miss.  If you are lucky enough like me, enjoy a Caffe Affogato and a fresh baked blueberry muffin.   The homemade tiramisu looks awesome something I would try it next time I'm around here."}
{"text":"This cafe has a wide variety of selection from gelato to coffee, in addition to cakes and other pastries. We opted for the gelato and at first look, the gelato looked very fluffy and soft. They had chocolate, vanilla, coconut, hazelnut, pistachio and a few other flavours. The hazelnut was light and good but the pistachio was surprising - I couldn't taste pistachio very well and it tasted a little bit off. Other than that though, the environment is great, places to sit with a patio. The decorations were very nice.   I might return to try another flavour!"}
{"text":"walked in and walked back out!!! 7.50 for a slice of tiramisu!!! Are they crazy. I know food prices have risen this year, but thats insane.    Everything else is also highly priced compared to everywhere else in the area."}
{"text":"On the way to another cafe,  walked by this shop, and realized it's new cafe. So we stopped in. Tried their strawberry iced coffee and dulce de lech latte. Was told the syrup was not as sweet as other latte on the menu. These coffee were spectacular. May be my new summer chill spot. Be wary if you are holding take out edibles, they don't allow outside food or drink and will crack down on you"}
{"text":"Cute place with ample seating and great wifi. It was quiet when we went on a Monday. Nice place to get some work done."}
{"text":"Cozy coffee shop on Main Street, Unionville. Rich espressos along with delicious pastries and snacks. Service is super friendly and helpful. I take my toddlers here for snacks and coffee (for me) all the time."}
{"text":"OTTIMO!!  This place is legit Italian. The espresso is just right, and the tramisú is light, foamy, and delicious!  If you are walking down main Street pop in and tell la Signora that Giancarlo sent you."}
{"text":"A small caffe on the side street on Unionville Main. It's a small and nice cafe with solid quality. I didn't know about this place until we went to starbucks but it was packed like crazy on a Saturday afternoon. My friend accidentally stumbled into here and it was warm and cozy.  The seating area probably had under 10 tables, I believe, the tables between each other were spacious, didn't feel like I was being squeezed into a small table. I enjoyed the quietness where we were able to chit chat in the cafe. We sat down and chatted for a few hours.  They close around 5pm on Saturday. I ordered a Latte with Almond milk and it was delicious.  All in all, a nice place for quality time and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Gran Sasso has been downsized and is now sitting right on Main Street.  The place is much smaller but it's cozy.  Service is as good as before.  Their scones are good; moist and light on the inside and with a crunchy crust.  Good coffee!  Great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Quaint little coffee shop on Main Street in Unionville. Beats Starbucks any day! Really appreciate the service and quality beans they provide."}
{"text":"Cute little place in Unionville featuring gelato, desserts as well as various coffees. We are big fans of the espresso and cookies - (they are always fresh and taste home made)  Italian sodas and cookies are also a nice feature. The patio is lovely as are the owners who are always friendly and make conversation with customers   A welcome addition to main st unionville!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop. Clean, nicely sheltered from the cold by a vestibule and second set of doors. Four small tables inside.   I gathered today with friends and we enjoyed our various lattes, teas and snacks. The blueberry scone was probably the winner.  No washroom, which was unexpected and we left maybe a little sooner than we would have otherwise."}
{"text":"Best coffee on Unionville Main St.! Beautiful coffee shop with a patio. Great baked goods (try the chocolate chip cookie) and sandwiches. They also serve gelato, which is great for an affogato. My favourite drink is the mocaccino."}
{"text":"Caffe Gran Sasso in #unionville   Tucked away down one of the alleys in this historic area you will find this little Cafe serving fresh food, sweets and coffee.   For my first visit I realized that the place has a band new #faema coffee machine with #tucillo coffee.  The owners were working hard in getting orders out and the coffee was good.  And there were no one button brew options.  All hand made drinks.   The #gelato was supplied by #sicilian brand from #toronto and was great as always.   The fresh pastries looked fresh and crispy. From #chocolate to #spinach there is a choice for you.   Come and experience a joyful break and a great Coffee in Unionville.  #foodreviewca #foodie #drink #instalike #instagood #6ix #eat #yum #markham #espresso #sweet #foodporn #foodpic #instaeat #instafood #restaurant #breaktime #relax #food #yelpgta"}
{"text":"They made an excellent iced, soy coffee. Friendly staff, quaint Cáfe atmosphere  was bright and fresh inside, the sweets look yummy! We enjoyed the patio outdoors."}
{"text":"Neat new place for coffee and gelato. A touch on the expensive side but the espresso is fantastic as are the sandwiches! Will definitely be back to try the gelato."}
{"text":"Caffe Gran Sasso is my to go place to grab a coffee and meet up with my friends whenever I am in Unionville Main Street.  The barista always friendly and coffee always well made.  I have been to their older location which is just all Main Street with some outside seating. It always been nice just enjoy a coffee and chill.  I have not yet been to their new location which is right on Main Street. I will drop by for a visit soon and hopefully will have a good experience just like before."}
{"text":"Caffe Gran Sasso is a very nice little indie cafe.  The coffee is solid.  It tastes rich and creamy.  The medium brew doesn't have a burnt taste, and I like it this way.    The storefront is pretty with a few chairs and tables.  Spacious interior with clean, tasteful and fun decor.  The two ladies were friendly.  I was advised that the bakery items were on sale near store closing.  I didn't tried them, so no comments on them.  Oct 10, 2016 Addendum: I had a Pecan Square.  It was essentially a Pecan butter tart in a square.  It was very well made.  Very buttery.  Sweet but not overwhelmingly so.  The sweetness was evenly spread across the 2 x 2 square, which was an impressive fit.  Also love the crust.  The square was best shared, or it could be heavy for one person in one seating."}
