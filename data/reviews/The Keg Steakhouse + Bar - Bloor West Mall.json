{"text":"Pretty awful.

Believe me, I have been to the Keg a fair few times in my life. I've been to at least 6 different locations all over Canada (including this one in the past ~5 years ago) and my most recent experience here was less than satisfactory.

Service started out promising, but went downhill. We were seated right next to an exceptionally loud party of eight even though the rest of the room was empty. Looking back, this may have been simply because the hostess was literally too lazy to walk to the far side of the room near the end of her shift. When seated, we were immediately turned off by the price of a glass of wine (between $7-12, more than it used to be), as well as the fact that you have to buy by the glass, not half-litre.

When taking our order, our waitress conveniently suggested the most expensive glass of wine, stating it as \"her favourite.\" She also tried to push the $40 lobster tail as a shared side plate. When she took our food orders, she was confusing and basically tricked my mom into ordering a $7 salad as an appetizer when she thought it was included in her meal. We then waited for about 25 minutes, when normally salads/appetizers are supposed to come out in about 5 minutes, and I was wondering where on earth this $7 salad could be. Meanwhile our waitress was spending a lot of time at the very noisy party beside us, chatting and being friendly, talking about wine and other random things. Not only is this annoying and rude, we were pissed off because we were expecting a salad and she was just wasting time there!

So finally, another waiter/bus boy or something brought over our dinners. So apparently, the waitress FORGOT our salads. At a high-end chain like the Keg, this is almost unheard of! And the worst part is that she acted like there was nothing wrong and she didn't even remember that she forgot because she was too busy talking to the noisy party beside us. We even tried to get her attention a couple of times and she didn't even notice.

Then...the food. Mine seemed like it had been sitting in the kitchen ready to go for about 10 minutes. It probably was, and while the waitress was supposed to be bringing it over she was just talking to the table next to us, letting my food get all crusted over. The mashed potatoes (one of my favourite things to get at the Keg) had dried out on the outside, and the steak sauce had the same problem. I'm not that picky so I ate it anyway. The steak was pretty good as usual - well cooked, tender, etc - but it had a pretty sizeable hunk of fat running through it. Also this time I tried a steak I'd never had before (pecan feta) and it was gross. I was expecting some type of pecan glaze, like candied pecans with feta mixed in the sauce. But it was basically the top sirloin, with chopped pecans and feta cheese on top. Not the best combo, and there were barely any toppings on it at all! They also had a rosemary sauce to go with it that I didn't think matched the flavour profile at all. Definitely not worth the extra $3...

Another thing that's very weird for the keg is that there was a couple at the table next to ours that left just as we were arriving, and it had dirty napkins, glasses and plates on it...and nobody touched it the whole time (our waitress must have walked by it at least 15 times, didn't bother to mention to anyone). 

Ok now in terms of management - I feel bad for the manager, he seemed be trying. He came around to ask how our dinner was, which shows effort. We told him about not getting the salads and also about the fact that the waitress didn't even remember that she forgot them. He offered us free desserts..but we didn't want them, and he didn't really bother to ask who it was that forgot everything. Anyway, he was making a good effort but obviously something is wrong with the management team here.

The only reason I rate 2 stars is because I love the Keg in general, and I wouldn't want to put the sacrifice of the magnificent cow to shame. Otherwise, this location would be 1 star for sure."}
{"text":"The meat was cooked as expected. It was tasty and well presented. Sometimes the ladies at the reception looks tired and like they don't give a ****. However, once in, the atmosphere is great. Their waitresses are really polite and professional. Went there multiple times and will continue to go."}
{"text":"My husband and I got gift cards for Christmas. We have never been to one before so did not know what to expect. The staff were amazing. They took are order and came back with a tiny loaf of bread. I was hoping for something special. But I found the bread something I make at home. Nothing special.  The food came steak for my husband cooked to perfection. I had chicken and ribs. The chicken was ok no flavor the good thing it was not dry. The ribs were not prepared right and again no flavor. I am a firm believer that if the food is not a 10 don't eat it. My husband tried it and said \"you should come and give some cooking lessons \". So it's sad but looks like I will have to keep cooking. lol"}
{"text":"I been to a lot of kegs and this one is very mediocre. My friend ordered a manhattan New York steak, medium well and the steak came out medium rare. We told the server and he brought it back and re grilled it. It came back very dry and tasted like stringy beef and all the flavours where gone. I was very surprised because other kegs are very good and they do a good job, but this one I don't think I would recommend :S"}
{"text":"We've been to this Keg location a few times and always had great service and good food!  Be prepared to wait up to an hour on weekends, but we don't mind as long as there's room in the bar to start with a drink and maybe even an appetizer."}
{"text":"Had a poor experience with service and food (very unusual for the Keg) but they reached out and made it better. Looking forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had a restaurant.

I ordered the prime rib and it came out ice cold.

I don't recommend this keg. The staff didn't even offer anything to me, it was disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of steak places, but The Keg is always a place that offers consistently great food, at reasonable prices.  We usually go to the one at 427 and Dixon Road, but we're told of this location by a friend.  It may be off the beaten path, but it still lives up to The Keg's standards.  The only negative I would have to say was that service was a little slow when we were there.  Usually I prefer not to be constantly bothered while eating, but 20 minute gaps between seeing our waiter was definitely a little too long for my taste!  Other than that I would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the keg. The staff are well trained and the food is good.  I give this place 4 out of 5. I think it would be wise for a Reno to earn the 5th star."}
{"text":"My first steakhouse in toronto!!!

As much as i love steak and visited virtually all top 10 in toronto, i still like going to Keg. Their prime ribs are very well done for less than 30$ and service is always kind. 

It is unfortunate i can't find a decent steakhouse in boston for less than $40 so i occasionally think back to my days in toronto whenever im in the mood for good steak."}
{"text":"What to eat:

Tasty steaks, lots of different flavours to choose from. The Spicy Peppercorn New Yorker is great. Ask for the Oscar-style dish over medium-rare filet mignon (instead of sirloin). The shrimp, scallops and asparagus in French Bearnaise sauce gives this dish tons of flavour! 

Atmosphere: 

There is guaranteed to be at least 40 minute wait. To save time waiting, swing by 40-60 minutes before the time you want to eat and place your name on the list. As long as you return back within your quoted time, you'll be accommodated. This location doesn't take resos on Saturdays.

For couples or large groups, ask for the seat by the fireplace."}
{"text":"Walked in with a reservation for 16 and they messed it up. Ended up waiting an hour and a half with the whole group in the lounge. They comped all our appetizers but it was still inconvenient. When we did get seated it was in 3 separate tables. What can I say, it was awful service"}
{"text":"I've been to all kinds of high-scale steak joints in my day, but for the price I've always loved the Keg.

However, I've only ever been to the Keg Mansion, the Keg downtown on York street, and the Keg near Fallsview Casino in Niagara Falls.

All of which are really nice and never feel like a chain restaurant. 

We ventured out to the Keg on the West Mall last night for the first time since we're in the area now, to see if it held up to our high expectations.

Aesthetically, it is NO Keg Mansion. Wow yeah it's really old and pretty tacky inside. I did not like the layout, the look, feel, anything about it. Really crappy compared to what I'm used to. 

However the food was amazing as always, our steaks cooked to perfection, seasoned well, and just exactly what I was hoping it would be.

The staff was friendly, courteous, if a TINY bit slow.

Overall we really enjoyed our meal, and would go back again, but yeah I really don't like the decor of the place, it felt dingy and off-putting, compared to the other Kegs I've been too."}
{"text":"Went to this location for my brother in law's 30th birthday.
First off, I've only been to the keg a handful of times as it's kinda pricey and a bit pretentious, but always good food.
Our waiter was a bit out of it i'm guessing because he was serving several tables simultaneously.  Forgetting things, requests, etc.

My husband and I had the Santa Fe Chicken Dip for starters and omg was it delicious! Hot, cheesy, yummy chicken with chips for dipping.... it was awesome.

I had the Chicken Oscar as my main dish with a baked potatoe.
It was very delicious, however I wasn't a fan of the Béarnaise sauce, it tasted alot like coconut which I do not like.

I also had the BELLINI  which is a Havana Club 3 Year Old rum, peach schnapps,
Chambord, peach purée and sparkling wine.

BEST DRINK EVER.

After 2 of those i'm sure I'd have a lovely BUZZ. LOL

Overall I liked this restaurant, it was a cute cottage type setting, which delicious food and very cool decor."}
{"text":"Hold a certain fondness for The Keg.  This weeks experience; nice service, clean bathrooms and interior.  Outside could use some paint.  This location is older, a bit dark and not an impressive interior.  Steak was great, that's most important!  Plus there is some space, not sitting on top of other people.  I appreciate that."}
{"text":"We come here a lot with family, though we've never really been in the restaurant section. We usually sit at a bar booth, and the night goes something like this...

All four of us settle in, get drinks usually wine. Get the bar appetizers, hold the bread (not that it isn't tasty, we're just not too big on carbs). We eat, drink and be merry. Then we get the bill.

This process usually goes off without a hitch 95% of the time (I'm sure we've been here over 100 times at this point....). There's been an odd fuckup here and there, a waitress is kind of useless (one didn't know what an Americano was and came back with an espresso and glass of cold water....), a steak is bad (usually the suppliers' fault, not the chefs), a drink misorder... Just stuff that happens over time, Murphy's law and all that.

The food is generally delicious, the bar menu cycles a lot and have silly experimental things like 'mini keg dogs'... Consistent deliciousness is the filet mignon, prime rib burgers, and shrimp cocktail. The shrimp cocktail is probably the best thing to get and is always amazingly fresh, crisp and tasty. Also full of protein, so yay. 

We sit in the bar because it is chill, the staff is super nice and knows us at this point, but they're all good people. It's the nicest 'pub' around the area, and worth a visit."}
{"text":"I've been to this Keg a few times now as it is pretty close to my house. I think it is a great location with great service. Never had a disappointing meal at a Keg! 
It is a bit confusing with the parking, but free none the less. The parking underground seems a bit sketchy, but never had an issue with my car.
I like this Keg compared to the downtown Kegs, not as busy!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with The Keg.  Can never go wrong with any of them.  This location was very busy but the service was great as it always is at the Keg and the food was delicious as well.  

We started off with the delicious warm bread, tasty crab cakes and vodka sodas.  Then continues with the featured cut, sirloin oscar.  My boyfriend had the New York Steak and fries.  Everything on our plate was delicious.  Would have liked to have bigger scallops and shrimp but although small, were very tasty.  The steak, to perfection. 

We left stuffed and happy :)"}
{"text":"The service was great as always. They really do need to renovate as this place is showing it's age. They have changed the Caesar dressing to some cheap crap. The old dressing tasted like it was home made. I think a Kraft bottle of Caesar tastes better that this new product.  I really hope they are not slowly decreasing the quality of there product to save some $$$."}
{"text":"I'm normally a big fan of the Keg, not only for the consistent food but more importantly for the cheap drinks. Where else can you get a double premium Scotch single malt for under $10? It's sick but cool from the perspective of the wallet. 
This location is quite dated, one of the last Kegs to maintain the 80s look that others left behind long ago. As such it'll close within a year or so from this review. 
Additionally it's never busy here after 8 in a weekday or 9 on a weekend but that's the suburbian nature of the location. It's missing a vibe other Kegs possess and that's its downfall from this side of the wood. 
Still, it's a decent place for a couple to come for dinner or a drink with friends for sure. Just not so much by yourself if you indulge."}
{"text":"This is exactly the restaurant I would go to if I was having an affair or needed to have dinner with a high class call girl.  

Located in the bowels of Etobicoke, no one would even think of looking for me out there and it's open until 11:30pm on week nights.  Inside, dimly lit, cozy booths and tables, provide all the privacy and secrecy I would need.

Other than its clandestine location and atmosphere, it's a pretty typical Keg restaurant complete with courteous, efficient service and consistent steak meals we've come to know and love.

We ordered the top sirloin dinner ($24.95) which came with a Caesar salad, veggies and potato sides, the pecan and goat cheese topped sirloin entree ($21.95) and glasses of malbec ($10.00 each).  

Both steaks came medium rare as ordered.  We probably wouldn't order the pecan/goat cheese sirloin again because it was coated in a glaze and the goat cheese overshadowed the flavor of the beef.  We finished off the meal with a slice of the Keg's signature Billy Miner Pie ($5.95).

I don't frequent the Keg that often but it's good for a quick mid-winter's craving for boeuf."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have noted, the service is very slow and the decor is dated but the food wasn't too bad. We had a wonderful friendly waitress, but the place was packed and I'm sure this is why it took a long time to get our meals and drinks. It was also EXTREMELY hot; I'm assuming this is because of all the people in the restaurant. I've been to several other Keg locations and I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Great steak and great portion for the money. The service was fantastic as well. Highly recommend the NY strip."}
