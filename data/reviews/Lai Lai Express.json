{"text":"I love this place, it's typical American Chinese food at a decent price. The lady (who is so polite and always manning the register) mentioned they could make more traditional Chinese food if it was requested.

It seems that most people order food to go as the restaurant is almost always empty. However, they have several old booths where you may sit and eat after ordering at the register.

Bottom line, it's a great hole in the wall place on Montford that has good food."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese food for the price. I enjoy going here every now and then. Great place and food."}
{"text":"Love the portion size. The dinner combo is the perfect size for a great low price. Bummer is they aren't open on Sundays. The General Tso Chicken is the best I've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had. I am still not sure what was in the Crab wontons, and the eggroll had a unexplainable foul odor. Save your money and go hit up one of the bars nearby."}
{"text":"Best chinese I've had since being born and raised in Charlotte. Please let me know different. Their sesame chicken and wings are the bomb!"}
{"text":"I've been using Yelp since I don't know when and this is my first review. This is the best authentic Chinese restaurant in town. Hands down. 

Believe me if you're looking for authentic Chinese food, come here. They have two menus: One cater to Americans that are used to Americanized Chinese food and the other is the authentic Chinese food. Try it and you won't regret it. 

I love the Singapore rice noodles there.. give it a shot !"}
{"text":"The food is soo amazing! The duck was perfectly crispy and the accompanying sauce was so delicious. The dumplings were also great and you know they are real Chinese when they have the perfect amount of vinegar in their dipping sauce. Recommend for anyone to eat here they won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of my co-workers took us here for lunch on a cold and nasty day for lunch. All I can say is that the owner really took care of us. The food was great.

We got some Cream Cheese ragoons which were out of this world.

I don't know if was my mood, the weather or the food but this place really hit the spot.

Was it great to look at??? NO!

But what really good Chinese places are?"}
{"text":"I ordered cashew chicken and wonton soup.  The chicken was mushy and tasteless and the soup was awful! The soup had a half of a wonton in it. The broth was beef broth that tasted like it came from a can."}
{"text":"The place isn't clean and there are like seven workers just siting around eating food and talking and the meat was skimpy for the price and my friend even stated it tasted funny."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food place. Good little spot for quick take out, I love it.

The inside is a bit old but still comfy, though I usually get the food to go. They can make more authentic Chinese food if requested but know what you want though and they can make it really well."}
{"text":"Sometimes the best surprises are the ones that you stumble upon. (I like that sentence, I think I'll post that on twitter or my fb status.)

Anyway, after a full day of work I was in dire need of inexpensive, don't have to dress up, Chinese food. I remembered that I'd passed a hole-in-the-wall Chinese food place on Montford not too long ago so I thought I'd search it out again and give it a try. 

It was a great stop and just what I was looking for. There are a handful of booths in the small dining-in area. They have a pretty extensive menu and fast service. I've been there twice in one week and they even made me a dish on request (veggies with pan-fried noodles) and it was really good. The portion sizes are right at that middle ground...enough to share if you are not too hungry or if you try to eat it all you'll walk away feeling a bit too full. 

This place won't break the bank, nor will it impress a first date. It's great for a quick lunch, casual dinner, or a take-out order. The owners are nice and get your order quickly. The one drawback for my lazy self is that they do not deliver."}
{"text":"This place is good for what it is. Cheap Chinese take out. I've eaten here several times and have good good each time. The only weird one that I had was the chow mein, not what I was expecting. 

One thing that I do like this place for is the egg rolls. 

Dining in area is small and a little weird for me but they have seats."}
{"text":"Charlotte has got something special that I'm now jealous of.  Yes, this review is a little late. Well, let's say I've been here multiple times and just well, haven't gotten to writing this review due to my laziness. But, alas, my thoughts on Lai Lai. 

I was turned onto this place by my parents who, well, said that this place was better than the Chinese restaurant that I frequented to in Knoxville, TN. After the first time I ate here, I was sort of hooked. So now, instead of them coming to Tennessee to see me and eat and order take out from the restaurant, the tables have turned and it's me going to Charlotte to bring some take out home from here.

This place is a hole in the wall, fast food take out joint. If you don't take a second look on the menu, you might just miss out on the delicious dishes that they have here. I had a plethora of dishes, as you can probably see through my photos. But let's just say... these dishes are authentic. And that's really rare to come by nowadays, with sugar added Chinese restaurant dishes that float around the place. By the way, the Lobster isn't in the menu and the lobster had to be brought in, in order of getting it cooked that way.

I will be forever coming back this place, and I would definitely suggest that if you're looking for some authentic Chinese food in Charlotte, to check out this place. My favorite dish has to be the Singapore Noodles. I have not tasted something this great in a long long time. This dish is especially hard to make it correctly because of the way the noodles are cooked. It usually comes out wet and sloppy, but Lai Lai makes it the best. I would suggest to order it 30 minutes before to get it correct because it takes time to get the noodles prepped for the dish."}
{"text":"They actually do roast duck rather well.  You can get 1/2 or a whole one.
I wen't here for most of my meals in grad school.
The owners are great.  Personable service.

{"text":"The best Chinese restaurants, or any Asian food really, will always be hole-in-the-wall establishments. Look passed the teriyaki chicken or the orange chicken, and order the real Chinese food: curry, black bean sauce, salted tofu, ribs, etc. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was very disappointing. Meals were served in \"to-go\" containers with plastic utensils, even though we were eating in the restaurant. The stir fried rice was just rice with soy sauce and one pea (literally one). The sweet and sour chicken was bits of deep fried chicken with sauce on the side. We also ordered shrimp lo mein, which had just a few shrimp and tiny pieces of cabbage.  The entire meal was very lacking in vegetables and flavor."}
{"text":"It's ok. Just your regular ol' \"American\" Chinese joint. Nothing fancy or stand out. I wouldn't eat-in this place. Didn't seem too clean."}
{"text":"I have just been in Charlotte 2 weeks and have dined there twice, the first time of which was because it was close enough according to GPS. They have both authentic and Americanized Chinese food. As I am Chinese, I ordered from the Chinese menu and so far this is the best authentic Chinese restaurant I have found in Charlotte (have been to about 5 Chinese restaurants in town already...) . Sure the environment is not fancy at all, but taste is GOOOOD!!! We ordered Ma Po Tofu and Roast Duck (for this two people's lunch, I spent 25 bucks, including tip). Great flavor and price!! I don't know how the Americanized Chinese food tastes (but I think it won't be too different from any other typical Americanized Chinese food...anyway) So if you like traditional Chinese food and stress food taste more than decoration of restaurant, go there!"}
{"text":"Not much to look at on the inside but really great basic Chinese food. General chicken is really really good. Not so sweet but more spicy as it should be. Chicken chow mein was spot on. Singapore noodles were delicious. Spring roll was decent. Wonton soup was lacking. The woman who helped us was very sweet. This is not PF Chang fancy in any sense but it is worth having to nip that basic Asian food craving."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars because you can actually find AUTHENTIC Chinese food in South Park? Well hello, I thought you can't get real Chinese food unless if you go to Asian corner or central, neither of which are nearby or any nicer to look at. That being said, this place has egg noodle soup, roast duck like some reviewers mentioned and pan fried flat rice noodle. They also have many more option just request for their Authentic Cantonese menu! As for the American Chinese food here, I'd say it's pretty standard, not the best but you can't beat the price. This place is owned by a couple. The husband cooks in the kitchen, his wife takes order and bags your food. A nice couple. Not the cleanest place but hey, if you are here for comfort food that is cheap and nostalgic, you can't expect to have a 5 star dining experience. Overall, if you don't mind the hole in a wall experience, come here for some nice homey food!"}
{"text":"General Chicken lunch combo for here. The chicken is crispy. The fried rice has some good char sui. The egg roll is not overly fried. The food was brought to the table. The portions look small. $7 lunch combo."}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte in November 2015 finding a GOOD Chinese restaurant was on my list of things to do. There are Chinese restaurants on every corner but only few are actually good. Luckily the first Chinese restaurant I went to was the bomb.com but I decided to cheat on my Chinese restaurant with this place here and this is what happened...

Although I loved the lady's personality that rang me up (I assume she's owner) it just didn't make up for the horrible food. I wish I had took a picture of it, but I was starving and didn't even think about it. It didn't even look like what I had ordered. 

I had General Tso's Chicken. This is my fave Chinese dish and my go to dish when trying a Chinese restaurant for the first time. I feel like if you can master General Tso's Chicken you can master all the Chinese dishes. 

About the dish: it was just flat out nasty. The breading was soft and mushy. Like the texture of a marshmallow. It felt like eating styrofoam covered chicken. I need my chicken to be crispy... No what I mean?!?! 

The flavor: well there really wasn't much flavor. It was quite bland. And if you've ever had General Tso's chicken you know better than a bland flavor. I ordered rice (no onions with extra egg). It was the most bland fried rice I've ever tried in my life. Not only were there no onions but there were no vegetables at all and the egg cost me an extra dollar. It was brown in color as if maybe they cooked it in some type of soy sauce but really had no flavor. It was very odd. However, I did like the egg roll. It was cooked perfectly and had good flavor. 

Needless to say this terrible meal is what I get for cheating on my Chinese restaurant. I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"We came for the roast duck which was highly recommended by an acquaintance.  However after tasting the duck, we were not overwhelmed.  The duck was a little cold on a cold afternoon and the skin was a little soggy and too much fat under the skin to our liking.  At $26 for a whole duck, it was not much a deal compared to what you can get from the local Grand Asia Chinese supermarket.  Probably won't go back at least not for the duck."}
{"text":"Not bad Lai Lai, I definitely have to give kudos to the customer service the owner at the register was super nice and made sure we received an authentic chinese menu to come back and try a dish. This alone deserves a full star . 

Mmmmmm, they have Chow fun , not many chinese  take out spots have the yummy Chow fun noodles , gotta get that next time . I ordered the curry chicken and it was good, could've used a little sugar to balance the flavors ,but it wasnt bad . I loved that the to go box wasn't packed with unnecessary amounts of rice . Perfect portion sizes for your Chinese food craving . The spring roll actually  had flavor and wasn't just bland cabbage stuffed into an egg roll wrapper . Food wasn't greasy , and personally loved the spiciness in this dish ."}
{"text":"This small place is not easy to find.  They have a good menu, I ordered the fried beef flat noodle to go.  It was just okay.  
The owner speaks Cantonese and I was able to chat with them a bit.  I think I need to order something else next time just so I can provide a better review for this place.  But the first dish didn't pass my test. 
I will go back to try other things."}
{"text":"My friend Leung's uncle own this place and that is not the reason I am biased! It is good food. It is small restaurant but they are fast!"}
{"text":"This is a little tiny hole in the wall to-go cheap Chinese place but they have enough space for a few dine-in tables.  Is it anything fancy?? NO.  But it sure is cheap and solid.  Where else can you find a lunch special for $4.50 with rice and egg roll (I personally like spring roll better)?  The portion isn't big, so I feel bad for eating the whole darn order in record time since I normally split my food into 2 meals to justify all the craps I eat.  But a girl gotta do what a girl gotta do to fill her belly.  

Just FYI, when I eat with my parents here, we actually order a little more authetic Chinese... like Ma Po Tofu and salt & pepper spare ribs, and they are actually really good.  If you don't speak Chinese (assuming that you don't), I wonder if you can still ask for it."}
{"text":"Another great meal, Singapore rice noodles and baby eggplant. Awesome! The hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Quick, standard take-out pretty much sums this place up. I got the chicken broccoli and the bf got General's chicken, both with white rice. Sadly, the rice was a little overcooked, but not inedible. My chicken and broccoli (my standard take out request) was really good. The broccoli was cooked nicely, as was the chicken, and the sauce was great! Not too thick, not too thin and had a nice sweet and salty taste. I sampled the General's chicken and thought it had the perfect amount of sweet vs. spicy; however the bf thought the chicken wasn't crunchy enough. Overall, the food was pretty good and, since it's close to where we live, we'll probably go back. Nothing fancy, but worth a shot if you live in the area and are looking for decent Chinese food.

IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE: They do NOT deliver! Carry-out or Eat-in only!!! We asked for delivery on the phone and were told they do not deliver and promptly hung up on."}
{"text":"Was craving some Chinese food for some random reason.  Stopped by Lai Lai on a Tuesday evening to get some food to go.  No other patrons were there while we were in the store - but the food came out quick and was a great value.  I think we've found our place for Chinese cravings...Chinese food cravings."}
