{"text":"Surprising that we didn't have a great experience.  This was my first time to any Bob Evans.  We had 5 people in our party with a simple enough order.  The service was ok, but the waitress was coughing, obviously sick, and still at work.  The food took a very long time to reach the table..around 40 mins.  The waitress and other staff were very nice overall though."}
{"text":"Dirty. Poor service....lots of staff just standing around while customers wait. Greeter didn't even acknowledge our presence ....just mumbled under her breath if there 2 of us then walked away. Food has gone down hill big time. Everything was bland. It's been a while since we've eaten here....can't say we will be coming back."}
{"text":"We were passing through Elyria on our way to our honeymoon and stopped at Bob Evans for dinner. Mind you, this was our first time ever eating at one!

It was decent. Definitely breakfast and \"home comfort foods.\" I would say it's very similar to Cracker Barrel but a little less formal than CB. 

Nothing fancy but we enjoyed our service and food!"}
{"text":"I went to have my breakfast here thinking there's not a lot of cars outside and I can eat right away its a mistake. I ordered my food right away and 15 mins later no food, so I decided to to used the restroom and when I came back my table is clear  everything is gone, when I ask the server what happen and she reply we thought you left already and I said ok just make it to go then waited10 mins finally I got a bag and 2 containers inside and pay it for $10.95 I handed my $20 got my change back and turn around about to leave I looked in the bag and no silverware so I ask and she said I will get some in the back, 5 mins later nothing so I left. When I reach my workplace and have breakfast I saw the worst breakfast I've ever seen 3 slice of bacon about half serving of scrambled egg and hash brown and I won't forget the burned toast for $10.95 I forgot to take picture coz I'm so upset and throw it away thinking why would I eat this. My long story short I would not recommend this place to anybody and they don't even deserve a star"}
{"text":"Coffee like dishwasher, flavor-free omelette, seasonal fruit in August: bananas, but hey its cheap and they have plenty of parking. Brunch in strip mall hell. (Exception: the biscuits are fluffy and tasty)"}
{"text":"Slowest service while waitress spent time chatting with other staff. Waited 20+ minutes for our order and had to keep asking for our waitress. Ok if it was packed but only about 10 tables are seated. Will never return here. Not family friendly with young children who are hungry and waited over 45 minutes to get our food"}
{"text":"I've been a Bob Evans customer for over thirty years, so I was truly disappointed with my breakfast this morning!  My two other dining companions had the same bad experience.  All of our Omelettes were poor.  The veggie Omelettes included bad tomatoes!  The omelette with bacon was of poor quality.  Our potatoes all tasted of a rancid oil taste.  The toast was overly saturated in a liquid butter grease.  The only saving grace this morning was our waitress and coffee!  Truly flabbergasted in what has happened!!!"}
{"text":"good food/service/price. its like a fancy Dennys or Carrows."}
{"text":"I really enjoy bob Evans breakfast food. Unfortunately, this is a bad review. I was seated today with my family with 2 little ones and forgot about. We were sat at 11:40 and not acknowledged until 11:58 by a server saying your server will be right here. The server finally arrived at 12:06. If I was alone I would have walked but with kids its a headache. 

I frequent this location about twice a month but these last few times have been pretty bad.  The manager seems like a nice guy but today was not acceptable. My mother brought to his attention that the tables around us all had service and food before us. He wasn't very empathetic at all. The apology was poor but the fact he never returned to the table was bs. 

I work in the same industry and I've seen bad service before but it has to be handled correctly. This location needs at least 1 more server. Come on it's only 4.05/hr..."}
{"text":"Well. To start off, we walk in at 8:30. On a Friday. We were ignored by some female worker that looks like she's on drugs, she couldn't even tell us they closed in 30 minutes? When I worked in the food industry we ALWAYS sat people regardless if they came in 2 hours or 10 minutes till close. 
Not to mention the manager (I'm assuming,) was nasty to us when he says \"we close soon, like 5 minutes.\"
I'm sorry, you mean 30 minutes? This is just poor costumer service for a restaurant. I'd suggest closing later on the weekend and also finding new employees to replace the ones who are rude to your customers. (You pay them because we pay you, right?) 
This sucks because I love Bob Evans, it's a great family restaurant to eat but I won't be visiting this one again."}
{"text":"I placed an online order here and when I came in with my two co-workers to pick it up, we stood in line to pay and after my friends went first the cashier looked past me and grabbed the man behind me's recipe and said \"you were standing in line\" and pushed me out of the way. And when I went to pay after him, she didn't acknowledge me at all and I walked over to the other cashier to check me out. So rude. I never write complaints on here, but I felt the need to share my experience. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Our service was okay, the food better. My family and I ordered some food, it was okay but I've had better at Bob Evans before."}
{"text":"I had at first tried to come here for a job but decided to go elsewhere as I needed my weekends. But when I first came here to eat, it was a pleasure. I have never been around a staff who is so at home and friendly. I've been here multiple times. Only one time have I had an issue with food delivery time and that is because it was unusually busy. The menu is the same the majority of the time, but I don't mind. My young taste buds can taste the flavors just fine. There is an older woman who works there that has been my waitress multiple times that I would love to give here a generous tip but never have the money to. She is always smiling and friendly, always taking into consideration any issues we have(which hasn't been much aside from one time where the hot chocolate tasted like muted water) and fixed the problem immediately. We are served within a few minutes of being seated and our food is brought out in a decent amount of time and it tastes pretty darn good to me. I suggest the sausage gravy and biscuit plate. Its lovely on a cold day with a nice cup of hot chocolate with a nice heap of whipped cream! The host who checked me out was very nice as well. One of the most recent trips that I've gone on I had a young man, about my age, check me out. He was very friendly, asked how the food was, if there was anything else he could help me with, seeming very genuine, and wished me a good day. Its hard to see people my age(early 20's) who are honestly happy or can perceive happiness at their jobs the way he did. Praise for him. By the way, the strawberry supreme pie, EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"We had a gift certificate.  I thought I would just give this location one more shot.  My last visit resulted in inedible food.  Raw pancakes, cold runny eggs. It's pancakes and eggs, right?  Maybe they were just having a bad night.  Nope.. My pancakes were raw inside.  A pancake... My daughter's omelet had the filling on the outside of the omelet, piled on top.  Weird.  They comped my pancakes.  Thanks.  When we cashed out, we were informed the only way we could tip the servers using the gift card, was in Bob Evans merchandise.  For real?  Am I tipping her a stale muffin or raw pancake?  So I paid for the meal and we used the gift card to buy candy and gum.    I would suggest staying home and making your own breakfast.  Or drive through McDonalds."}
{"text":"Always bad service. Not one server will treat you the way you should be treated, they're not rude they just seem not to care at all. I waited 15 minutes for my food to be corrected, 15 minutes for the check, 15 more minutes for a box. this was when the place was slow, too. The food is usually mediocre, fine when you're hungover but not somewhere to go if you're looking to wisely spend your money."}
{"text":"We went there because the fam was hungry and being a Saturday night, everywhere had a wait in Monroeville except for there and eating there that night we could see why. I had the fork and knife meatloaf, couldn't even finish it because it was gross my wife's plate she could finish hers cause it was disgusting they serve a bowl of chicken noodle soup to my eight-year-old daughter had no broth it was just noodles absolutely ridiculous how that bowl looked we even asked him about that they said well it sucks up all the the broth and comes out pretty dry. So why in the hell would you serve it to an 8 year old or anybody. My daughter ended up throwing up in the vehicle that night too. Never again will I go to the Monroeville location for dinner ever we should just stop with Fridays that night"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the look when you first walk in. My first time to this restaurant, but I've been to many bob Evans, especially down south. The service was good, our waitress great, she was attentive and timely. The food was the only semi disappointing aspect. The menu picture was far from what I was served. The taste was mediocre. The cheese on my food wasn't even melted."}
{"text":"It is a good establishment, always clean and everything we tried are yummy. Gonna come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had breakfast here. We never ate here in two years we have been together but I wanted to go try it out. I'm glad we did because the food was great.  Even the toast was good. Lol I recommended for breakfast."}
{"text":"Good menu choices. Very slow service - took 40 minutes to get a refill on our coffee. I could tell that our food had been sitting quite a while since some of it was delivered cold. I will not be returning to this Bob Evans."}
{"text":"I ordered some family style meals for the Sunday after Thanksgiving. I had to wait about 5-10 minutes more than the time promised. The staff offered me a free drink while I waited and gave me some coupons even though I didn't say anything about the wait. While I was waiting I noticed how friendly and helpful they were with everyone that came and go. 5 Star service!"}
{"text":"Service is warm and friendly from the moment you walk inside. Food is served warm and coffee is great, unlimited!!"}
{"text":"service bad
food cold
wait too long"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this location . I get the same thing most of the time ( pot roast dinner ). This time I did a carry-out order and was very disappointed in the size I was given. Probably never going to use this location again ."}
{"text":"There was hardly anyone in the restaurant when our party of six arrived.  Took 30 minutes to get food.  Had to wait on everything for excessively long periods of time (water, syrup for pancakes, redo on french toast for a kiddo that came out extra dark).  Then they got the bill wrong.  Wait staff was friendly but everything was ridiculously slow."}
{"text":"The grapes weren't that great and the forks could have been cleaner. I would recommend getting better grapes and cleaning the silverware a little more."}
{"text":"My husband and I have decided never to eat at this Bob Evans again.  We have eaten at many Bob Evans and generally enjoy their food this restaurant is truly terrible.  We have been to this restaurant at least five times, for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The Wait Staff, with a few exceptions, could care less about getting your order right.  The food is not well presented.  Even the manager is so laid back that he seems not to care about customer service at all.  There is one male waiter who I am actually afraid of.  He is nasty, does not give you what you order...basically forgets.  One time we just gave up, paid the bill and left him one penny.  I wish you had negative stars.  This place would get many!  When I go out to eat I expect decent food for what they charge, to be fed in a reasonable amount of time and not have to beg my server for anything.  But here it isn't like that.  It feels like they think they are for a party and to spend time talking and laughing with each other while the poor patron is left to feel like some dumb fool for trying to get their meal.  I have better places to spend my money and also other  Bob Evans that I can go to where I am  not totally ignored.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE."}
{"text":"Top hat.
I noticed Bob Evans had a tv ad for french toast and broster chicken. They both looked like a real treat. So in the morning had the french toast. (Bad) way to sweet. Then in the evening thinking it was just a bad dream I went to try the chicken. It turned out that it was done a day ago and reheated.Bad Bob Evans.  Will not try stunt again."}
{"text":"Worst tasting bitter coffee you will ever encounter in a restaurant. Went this evening for dinner and stood for more than five minutes while the manager ignored us.... It was 7:00 pm no dinner rush. No employees even attempted to seat us either. No many dinner options near out home but this one is definitely OFF the list!"}
{"text":"Nothing to flashy, good breakfast food, very friendly and fast service, clean location"}
{"text":"Wow, wow wow! Bob Evans you are coming to the foodie town and you offer that!!! Overpriced, institutionalized & tasteless food!! I feel sorry for the serving team. They are a bunch of nice people but how can you compete in a town that offers verity of a great food block after block. 
For those of you who need a breakfast fix, visit Place to Be couple of blocks away where you will get a real omelet and all other breakfast fixings for the same or less price but double the size of a plate. 
I hope that Lakewood residents will support local business rather that chain."}
{"text":"I went to Bob Evans over the weekend with my three sons and daughter in law. It was a really awesome experience and I wanted to share. It started with very quick turnaround so on a busy Sunday we were seated in about 10 min. The hostess was SO pleasant! Great table, fantastic meal but mainly wanted to compliment the waitress. Her name was Lucille and she was tremendous. Went over and above on service. Friendly, efficient, and quick. Gave us all new drinks to go...checked on our coffees and sodas frequently...i hope her manager sees this. I told her she was the best waitress I ever had!!"}
{"text":"For those wondering why anyone in Lakewood would choose to eat at a chain breakfast restaurant when there are umpty-umph tasty independent restaurants, bars, diners for breakfast, etc. here, if you need to \"eat out\" with seniors or kids who like to have a standard menu to pick from and don't want to drive clear out Center Ridge Road to find a place, this Bob Evans is for you.  It fills the gap left when the IHOP in a different part of the 'Wood moved out a few years ago and was replaced by yet another Mexican joint. You can take your 80-year-old dad, visiting Great Aunt Sally, or little cousins here, they can order the same Rise n' Shine they get back home in Indiana, the restroom probably won't look like a rejected Stones album cover, and you will have less 'splaining to do than at an indie place about eccentric patrons and help (\"Mommy, why does that man keep saying f___\"?) or about why the regular at the next booth ordered the same as your elderly relative but received a visibly bigger portion of meat and extra gravy since she's buddies with the local diner wait staff. 

This Bob Evans, being new, is spiffier than most, and the menu, like I said, is average but consistent.  If you stick to the standard offerings, the prices are generally no more than a couple dollars higher than an independent diner, and the portions are usually large enough to require a to-go box.  The greeters and counter staff tend to be super-friendly and \"on\"; the wait staff are sometimes good, sometimes meh (and the person serving you usually seems to change at least once mid-meal - either they work really funny shifts or they have a strange way of dividing up the work).  Since it's a Bob Evans, we expect a certain amount of bored service and simply adjust the tip based on the level of engagement we get. 

One nice thing they do is have designated charity days when, if you mention a certain local charity or show a flyer, they donate a percentage of your bill to said charity.  We like to go on the days that benefit the Lakewood animal shelter.  There are other ones too and a calendar on display showing the different days (or you can check their website).  Wish more businesses would \"give back\" to the community in this way."}
{"text":"I am a frequent diner at this location.  Usually, I enjoy my meal.  I usually come for a late breakfast or early lunch.  Today I arrived in the late afternoon.  It was quite disappointing.  Not the usual food quality.  It appeared that the breakfast that I ordered at 3:30pm was cooked at 8am.  Rubbery eggs , cold hash browns and cold French toast.  Yikes!  I will chalk it up to a bad time of day to dine."}
{"text":"For a chain, Bob Evans isn't terrible but this location is pretty bad. Everything seems greasier here.  Bacon is either raw and limp or rock hard. Eggs are always overcooked.  The food arrives with an oily sheen.  The waitresses seem disinterested and a couple of them openly bicker with each other.  I thought it was a chain wide decline and happened to try another location which was much better."}
{"text":"Don't ever do carry out online or curbside pick up  here. They don't know what they're doing and refuse to try. We've eaten in the restaurant once and it was just ok. I have been ill for a few weeks and for a couple Sundays we opted to order breakfast to go so that I didn't have to be in a busy, overstimulating restaurant. The first time I paid with my debit card online and when my fiance picked our order up he was chased down in the parking lot like a criminal being accused of NOT PAYING. They took his debit card and charged him. And made him quite embarrassed at the same time. I called and complained to the manager about paying twice and he assured me that the charge on my account wouldn't go through. It then took 4 days for the charge to disappear from my pending transactions. 2 weeks later, we order again, choosing curbside pick up this time and my fiance paying ahead of time with his card, but still having to give his card to the employee who came to the car...which is ridiculous, it should be like delivery-have a slip to sign with the food and then it's curbside. He gets home and he's missing a major component to his breakfast. I call to speak to a manager and get placed on hold. A woman picks up, who I assume is a manager, explain our issue to her and she tells me she'll get a manager. Isn't that who I was holding for? Then she hangs up on me. We opted to return our breakfast and demanded our money back. We'll never order from or eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is filthy. Absolutely disgusting. Denny's is cleaner than this place. Our waitress was nice but when looking at the new menu, everything I wanted was no longer available on their menu. I tried ordering a blt and they are no longer available. I asked for Texas toast and it's not available. My daughter asked for smiley fries and she said they aren't available even though they are still on the menu. She said, oh, those are old menus. The restrooms are gross. 

5 tables around us were dirty when we walked in and dirty when we left. Horrible atmosphere. 

The food was just ok. Nothing great. Our biscuits were hard as a rock. 

There is no option for zero stars so I have no choice but to give it one star."}
{"text":"I spend about 300 nights-a-year on-the-road.  Bob Evans is one of my favorites for dinner; chicken and noodles over mashed potatoes.  It is so good that it reminds me of the dinners at the Odd Fellow's hall and church dinners when I was a kid.  
I like the quality and consistency of Bob Evans' restaurants."}
{"text":"Horrible service and food, watched management chat up younger female servers as we could see our food in the pass thru..when we did get it,plates were so hot we couldn't touch them, not to mention server carried out on small tray and was wearing half my order on her chest. Did not eat,paid check and left.never,ever to return. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 20 minutes just for drink order. Another 45 minutes for the food. On a week day morning completely unacceptable. Can only imagine how bad the weekends are. Is there anyone managing this place. Absolute mess."}

{"text":"Bob Evans has been doing it right for over 30 years. I love the staff at this location. They are always nice and you can always get what you want. I was excited when this place opened and I go regularly."}
{"text":"Eat at Bob Evans at least once a week.  Usually after church on Sunday.  Always busy when we arrive, but never wait more than 15 minutes to get seated.  Food is almost always good.  Serving time on occasion is slow even without a crowd.  Wait help are always friendly and helpful.  A good place for a meal or dessert anytime.  Great coffee!        Craig K."}

mush slices that don't taste like the grill. Those are a hard to find menu item.

{"text":"Ask for L. A. as your server she is amazing and ordered the fruit & nut multigrain pancakes they are topped with banana and don't need syrup!! All the staff was friendly and there is a happy atmosphere."}
{"text":"This Bob Evans location has the friendliest staff!  It's very clean, and the food always comes out hot and delicious. I've been to other nearby locations but always get disappointed in the customer service. NOT here!!!  It always feels like we're family here. Thanks!"}
{"text":"My experience today at this Bob Evans would actually warrant a score of zero (0) stars if it were possible to give one.  

I arrived at the restaurant at approximately 9:30 am.  The restaurant was not that busy and many tables were open.  I was almost immediately seated, and shortly after that a waitress approached the table and took my drink order.  She returned with my water in short order and took my food order.  Approximately 20 minutes later, a different waitress brought my French toast to the table.  As I was buttering the French toast, the original waitress came by the table to check on my opinion of the food and said something to the effect that I had not yet taken my first bite of the food. I informed her that I had just gotten the food and she kept moving.  I took my first bite and it was lukewarm.  Not wanting to assume that it was all lukewarm, I took another bite and it was also not very warm.  So I tried to get the attention of a waitress but could not without yelling so I took my plate up to the counter and asked if someone could heat (microwave) the food so that I could eat it.  The original waitress then appeared from somewhere and asked if I wanted to get fresh food.  I told her that I would eat the original food if I could get it heated.  I gave the plate back to the waitress who brought the food to my table and waited at the counter for her to bring it back out to me.  It didn't take long to get it back and I went back to my table to eat.  I ate one piece which had been warmed up but the second piece was still just lukewarm so I didn't eat that piece.  I sat at the table for another 15-20 minutes waiting for my check.  (Really, the only reason that I waited so long was to see how long it would take to get someone to stop by the table.)  Finally, the original waitress came to take the order of another table of \"customers\" who had just been seated nearby and, after taking their order, turned around to me as I was just rising to go to the cash register as I had reached the end of my patience, to tell me to tell the guy at the register that I was at table 23.  At 10:30, I was at the register and the waitress was there giving the guy at the register my check. 

I was virtually ignored for the my entire extended time at this restaurant.  I believe that my food sat for an extended period of time waiting to be brought to my table by a person who was not the least bit interested in getting it to me.  I hope that the management of this restaurant will take heed to their reviews and address the issues that have been sited in them."}
{"text":"Yesterday, April 11th, 2016 while I was at Bob Evans in Lakewood, Ohio, 14115 Detroit ave, I witnessed a waitress by the name of \"Barb\" take a sundae to a older lady. A few seconds later Barb brought the sundae back to the counter. I watched Barb scrap something off the top of the sundae with a spoon into the garbage can, hitting the spoon on the can while she scrapped. Then Barb took the sundae in the back and then I watched her wipe off the top of the sundae with a napkin. Barb then took the sundae back to the elderly lady. Hygiene is NOT a priority at this place at all!!"}

{"text":"Candied bacon and reliably tasty sausage make Bob Evans a reliable stop. Also they have both hash browns (shredded) and home fries (diced) potatoes."}
{"text":"It is closed down, boarded up. We just went there and it is closed. I don't know what else to say but it is closed down."}
{"text":"Service is OK but the people who greet you in the morning are very unfriendly.    We started eating there a few months ago and have become regulars but every time they act like they have never seen us before.   Food is OK too"}
{"text":"Terrible service, I just tried to have lunch there with only one other table being there and I waited over 15 minutes and no one even came and took my drink order. Going on 20 minutes I decided to leave. Reading through the other reviews this must be a chronic issue there and reflects on poor management."}
{"text":"After coming to satiate my curiousity after it was built, i can testify that
1) the broasted chicken is indeed fresh, not frozen.
2) service at this location seems... forced: it looks like the wait staff could be somewhere else they would be there instead. It made me feel uncomfortable. 
3) The price relative to the portion size also would make this restaurant not be a top choice in the future, but that might be my stomach talking as a man, and might not be an issue to you. Just an observation, that's all."}
{"text":"Usually love Bob Evans but ordered cinnamon pancakes and the middle one was burnt black and the waitress asked if it was too dark.  Yeah a little!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday we decided to get carry out. Everything was correct but my turkey dinner.
It was a total rip off. There was only one piece of you might call an almost shaved piece of Turkey and no cranberry relish.  It should have been called stuffing and mashed potatoes with a slice of Turkey. Definitely never getting carryout here or ever eating here again!
Do not believe what the picture looks like on their website!"}
{"text":"Another surprisingly disappointing experience.  The old reliable Bob Evans is no longer. 

This evening's disappointment focuses on a simple take-out meal. My wife ordered a salad....hard to screw up and Bob managed to deliver what he promised. 

I opted for their highly-touted, heavily advertised, Broasted Chicken three-piece meal.  Not gourmet obviously but, a simple satisfying meal...or, so I expected. 

Instead, I received three skimpy pieces of Bob's typical deep-fat fried tasteless chicken. I know the difference!  Adding insult to injury...my side order of green beans was a no-show. 

These may seem like small transgressions but, there is a cumulative effect.  All I ask, Bob, is that you deliver what you've promised."}
{"text":"We usually love it there. Not today. Service was slow and bad. We never got offered and refills.  The table that came on after us, our waiter refilled them 3 times. My husband's meAl was wrong.  Now we see why the new eAt n park is so busy. Bob Evans service went downhill."}
{"text":"Service is terrible not clean when waitress refilled drink left empty cups on table n never checked on us"}
{"text":"Service and food were good, as expected.  Our experience was very pleasant from the time we walked in the door to the time we walked out.  Our breakfast was very satisfying and the price was great for what we got.  This place is kid friendly, which is a huge plus.  We'll definitely be back!"}

{"text":"This place is fantastic! Food is delicious and the staff is super friendly! I've also fallen in love with their cinnamon  blossom dessert. It's like a cinnamon roll in a cupcake form."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago, my girlfriend and I decided to visit the Lakewood location for dinner. Having eaten at many different Bob Evans restaurants and working there for a short period, I was well versed in their quality of food. While I've never been amazed by the food, I certainly haven't minded it. I ordered a cheeseburger, as I often do, considering myself a very good judge of burgers in general and it being one of my favorite meals. I started to eat it and my girlfriend, who was sitting across from me commented that it looked pink inside. Not minding a little bit of pink in the middle, I brushed it off and continued eating. About a third of the way in a piece of the meat squeezed from between the bun and fell onto my plate. As usual, I picked up the piece of meat in order to toss it in my mouth. Upon doing so, I noticed it felt cold. Not cold from cooling down, but cold as in barely thawed. I looked at it and squished it with my fingers. At that point, I realized that it wasn't just a tad pink, but completely raw. Obviously, I stopped eating it. My girlfriend had ordered eggs, sausage and hash browns, with a bowl of chicken noodle soup. Her has browns were so burned, that they were literally black and the soup was bland and watery. We asked our waiter, who had already forgotten several different things to get the manager for us. He came to our table and we not only expressed our displeasure verbally, but showed him the uneaten food. He apologized and took the burger off of our bill, but did not seem shocked by any means, or extremely concerned. Both of us own smartphones, but did not think to take pictures of the food. Later regretting this of course. I even joked with my girlfriend that I might get food poisoning and sue them, if I survived that is. To be honest, I thought the manager would have done a lot more. Comped the entire dinner, offered us a gift card, etc...He did not. This was the worst meal we've ever had at a Bob Evans and considered it absolutely discussing. We will never patronize this location again and would highly suggest that anyone avoid this place."}
{"text":"Not that Bob Evans isn't a chain - but I have eaten at this Bob Evans a number of times, the service is always great and the food is very good...tonight was no exception - and they have added some great new items to their menu..."}
{"text":"Food was fine but we went here Friday and for the first time in my entire life I didn't leave a tip. We waited for our waitress to come over for awhile, then she took our drink order and waited again and finally got our drinks and she said she would be right back to take our order......ten minutes later she came back. More waiting and finally a manager brought our food. After finishing our food we waited again. She finally came back and we asked for take home containers which she said she would bring....ten minutes later we got up went to the counter to ask someone else for containers. While all this was going on , our waitress and another as well as a hostess were involved in one loud argument after another about who would get what table. First our waitress was yelling at the seater and another waitress about rotating tables while she couldn't handle the ones she already had. The 2 waitresses then were going to the older couple at a table and each were asking for drink orders while telling them they were their real waitress not the other. At one point they were both at the table trying to get an order from the couple while arguing in front of everyone. The most unprofessional thing I've ever seen in a restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been coming here nearly weekly but we are officially done. The service seems to get worse every time. A few visits ago we stood at the front waiting to be seated for literally 5 minutes while there were multiple employees standing at the register talking to each other. We then were seated and sat for about ten minutes without having anyone come over to us. We than overheard an argument in the kitchen about which waitress had our table. After finally having her come out and take our order it was another 20 minutes to get breakfast for two. Today we returned and after placing our order it took literally nearly 30 minutes for us to get our food and all we both ordered was 2 eggs, home fries and toast......and our toast was burnt! how do you burn toast? Even after finishing our meal , we sat for at least ten minutes waiting for our check which never came. we had to get u and ask for it at the counter. Since writing the review , I sent an email to corporate and a week later never got a response other than \"thanks for inquiring about us\"! Bob Evans would be rolling over in his grave if he knew what was happening to his brand."}
{"text":"I've eaten in this Bob Evans many times.  It's always a safe bet for a good breakfast or brunch.  Of course it's also the first restaurant I come to on the way into town!  The food is always good and the service is friendly.  They serve breakfast all day.  Only once did my brother-in-law have to wait forever for something before being told they were out of it.  They have a good size menu for lunch and dinners too.  It's nothing really special, just a good dependable place to eat when you don't want to think about where to go.  Coffee is OK but depends on if it's just brewed.  They need to get milkshakes!!  Wifi is available."}
{"text":"Last year the boyfriend and I went here for dinner.  We ordered an appetizer and our dinner separately.  They both came at the same time and my dinner was stone cold.  Our waitress, when told, said, \"Oh, sorry\" and wandered off with no offer to replace it or try to get it re-heated.  Cold mashed potatoes, yum! (NOT!) We did mention this to the person when we checked out and they apologized and took the appetizer off of our bill.

We haven't been back since.

Flash forward to a few days ago and the mom and I went.  Better service and my dinner was hot at least, but our waitress (a different one thank the heavens) did not offer me a refill on my drink and she brought the check without seeing if we wanted anything else, which is one of my pet peeves along with asking me what I want to drink when my ass is not even in my seat nor have I had a chance to even read the f-ing menu.  (It's like the fate of the free world depends on me having my lemonade RIGHT THE F*** NOW!) 

Will I go back, probably since this is the closest one to me, but I will think twice before I go."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this Bob Evans. When you enter the first impression is that the restaurant looks bright & clean.  Then you notice the lines of people waiting. The line on the left are those waiting to be seated. These people could be there for 10 minutes or so. The line on the right are those waiting to pay for their meals, which is a minimum of a 10 to 15 minute wait.  The way the restaurant is laid out, the people in this line constantly have to move out of the way so that people who are leaving can get to the door.  They also have to step aside to allow those people who were waiting to be seated to finally be taken to their table. The person working the register has multi-tasking down to a science. Not only is she accepting payments, she is also answering the phone and talking into a headset to who knows who without making any eye contact to the person paying their check. I'm not sure why there was a second register since it was not used. This restaurant was very busy due to its location so it would make sense to actually use it!  The food was typical Bob Evans fare. Ed our server was very attentive.  So if you want to wait in line coming and going, and you have extra time to waste, then this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I have had two great Bob Evans experiences in central PA but this location doesn't have the same quality of staff. Our food was good and the waiter was excellent. However, my pork chops were under cooked (red). I notified the waiter and the manager never made the obligatory visit to our table. My wife notified the manager and got an attitude from her. She gave us the \"but you ate it\" defense. I did eat them until I saw the red part near the bone... Normally I'm a clean yer plate kind of guy, but not this time. She realized the err in her ways and offered to take it off the bill, which she did. We shouldn't have had to discomfort ourselves and argue. That manager needs to learn the \"customer is always right\" thing. I went against the yelp reviews when choosing this restaurant. That's the last time I'll make that mistake. I had high hopes. I'll go to the other Bob Evans for sure, but not this one."}
{"text":"Holy cow ... where do I start?  If I could rate it a zero, I would have.  The server butchered our order, disappeared from sight for a half hour, and then returns with cold food.  When my wife told her that her omelet was cold, she had the audacity to ask if my wife wanted it warmed in the microwave to warm it up or another order made fresh?  After expressing some initial discontent with our order so far, we then got the stare down from one of the management staff from across the dining room.  Instead of coming over to apologize or check on our concerns, he just kept staring at us ... big marks for customer service there.  

Upon check out, we had to ask for a manager in order to discuss the issue.  Thankfully, a different member of the management staff came over to discuss it.  He showed some skills in dealing with a customer who had a bad experience.  He comped some of the bill and apologized.  He even offered up a dessert to go for those who may have had cold or inaccurate meals.  I am hopeful he just has really good customer service skills, but my gut tells me it is just from way too much practice.

I will not go back, nor will I recommend it to anyone ... even to people I don't like!"}
{"text":"This by far the worse Bob evens that I've ever been to. So let me start off by saying that I used to always love to go to Bob Evans for breakfast no matter what, I loved their coffee and their food was great delight. So when I came to this location, I had to worse experience, and I could definitely say that I'm not coming back. 
As usually, when I came there I orders their classic breakfast, and my sister got a crepe. As soon as the food was out in front of us, my sister found a huge piece of hair in her crepe, and it was probably the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. So then the manager refunded me on that, and we continued with out breakfast. After that, I found another wonderful surprise in my food ! As I was eating the home made fries, I bit on straight up rocks ! They had rocks in those potatoes. So I got the manager again and he refunded me on those fries. But that's not the end, I also had hair in my eggs, which I ended up paying for ! And coffee in my water ! The place was gross not clean, the service was terrible ! I definitely don't recommend this location !"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to this restaurant.  I was told that I would enjoy it.  Well I enjoyed the wildfire grilled chicken salad.  But the four cheese grilled cheese on brioche toast was not good.  It was bland.  And worst of all there was no mayo!!! Who runs out of mayo!!  The burger was sent back.  Disappointed but I hope that it will be better when I return again...one day."}
{"text":"I will most certainly NEVER go back! 

This is why:

One night my boyfriend and i decided we wanted a bite to eat, somewhere cozy and close. We decided we'd go to Bob Evans because we havent been there in a long time. When we got in, a host sat us down. We were there for 15 minutes, and still nobody even acknowledged us at all, nobody asked for drinks or ANYTHING. (it wasnt busy in the least either) there were probably enough waitresses for each table to have their own waitress. Naturally, we got up and left. I dont think i would've been so mad if it was just a misunderstanding in communication;however, the staff was just talking, texting, and having a good old time as my boyfriend and i just sat there..waiting.

I dont suggest going to the west mifflin Bob Evans at all."}
{"text":"This bob evans location may seem family friendly at first but what goes on in the kitchen is far from that. While I was enjoying a late breakfast I overheard a man apart of the kitchen staff openly insulted and made fun of a customer, to the point of the customer walking into the kitchen and adressing the staff directly.This same kitchen staff member also rarely fixes dishes when they are sent back for being undercooked. I watched this man take back a plate of mostly raw hashbrows and just let it sit off to the side for 5 minutes before simply sending the plate back out to the customer still undercooked and now cold. I was very appalled when I ordered a refill of my caramel coffee and overheard the women making it complain about not wanting to clean the machine and just forced it to produce a dirty coffee drink for me which... I had lost my craving for. All the while I was enjoying my meal I witnessed 3 groups of people come in and wait nearly 10 minutes before getting seated. Call me crazy but this kind of behavior does not sound like customer service"}
{"text":"Last visit was the last visit. Horrible rude waitress...annoyed and just nasty. I'm sure the food would have been good but I left it untouched on the table and told the manager why. I used to go at least 2 times a week after working midnights. I won't be back...no one should deal with a nasty waitress...I did leave her a tip...don't be rude to your customers."}
{"text":"I give this Bob Evans one star because of the awful customer service!!! Me and a group of 6 of my friends came in last Sunday (yes, I understand Sunday's are busy days) and waited 45 mins to be seated after being told it was only a 20 min wait. Then once we got seated we found 7 bees at our table, there must have been a hive somewhere? I have no idea how they got inside. We told the manager and he eventually came over and killed them. After that we waited about 25-30 mins to get our orders taken from the rudest waitress ever. Then had to wait another 30 mins to get our food. My food was good though I would give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good food and nice place but staff seams to be depressed and not so welcoming !! No one want to see a dull or sad face in the morning !"}
{"text":"Worst. So disorganized. Management team ill equipped to handle a crowd. unapologetic."}
{"text":"While the reviews weren't the greatest, the restaurant was located near our hotel so we figured, \"why not?\".  Service was prompt and courteous, the burgers we ordered were standard fare...nothing amazing but good, solid, American food. We had the molten lava cake with ice cream and candied bacon...excellent!  Go to Bob Evans for that if nothing else."}
{"text":"Good food but only if they were attentive. I can't argue, I'm here for work and this place has a good filling meal. It can't really get better especially for the price. But if you're in this neck of the woods, I would recommend this place and return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast and never had a problem until this visit. Just before a busy lunch hour, so I can understand a wait while 1 hostess cashed out patrons, until she had a chance to seat us. But seriously, just 1 girl to do all that during lunch hour? Where was management? And then our server was just ok. No extras that we requested, just what we ordered. And the worst part was cashing out: when my card was being charged for payment I was told it was too late to leave a tip, in the amt of my choice. I could leave the remaining balance on my gift card, which was a 50% tip! Definitely not worth 50%!!! Merry Christmas to the server. Bob Evans is my favorite breakfast destination but absolutely won't choose or recommend this location again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast restaurants that is a chain. Great sausage, french toast, pancakes, crepes! Also good lunch and dinner menus, but to me breakfast is the best part. 

Staff has always been quick and food is usually served very quickly. I have never had a subpar meal and highly recommend it as a breakfast place in particular."}
{"text":"I think I am now aware why the parking lot is empty on a home game day.  Wow, get it together people"}
{"text":"We have always had fresh and tasty food at Bob Evans. The wait staff are experienced and if you avoid Saturday mornings, you seldom have to wait long to be seated. The soups are especially recommended."}
{"text":"Thought one of the \"older people\" mentioned in other reviews should offer a review. I enjoy Bob Evans and I was very pleased to see them come to Lakewood. This restaurant can best be described as comfortable. It has excellent parking and is a building that was built as a restaurant not wedged into a vacant storefront. The decor is bright and it is very clean and well maintained. The menu is typical Bob Evans but all the items I have tried are well prepared. Menu items appropriate for any meal of the day. Love their breakfast selections. Today tried their new Brioche French toast. Very tasty. My wife loves the pot roast for dinner and I am a big fan of the broasted chicken. Take out breads and pastries are available. Specialty holiday meals are also available. Comfort food at a reasonable price in a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bob Evans is a great place to have a filling breakfast. I stopped in here for a quick bite to eat while on the Westside and thoroughly enjoyed it. You wouldn't think it was a chain when eating the food. I ate a breakfast of strawberry pancakes, eggs, sausage, and hashbrowns. It was filling and enjoyable. The restaurant has a feel of an old country restaurant. The servers are very friendly and helpful. There is a little gift shop style area where you can buy books and other various items. The selection is not surprisingly limited. I really enjoyed Bob Evans and I plan on heading back."}
{"text":"Let me say the food was amazing i just dint know where to start hahaha and the service lovely i would really love to come back and i recommend  it i always asked my self before coming why is bob evans always full yeah now i know good job"}
{"text":"The last 3 times I've been here I have had horrible service. Mostly from one waitress. Kimberly I think her name is. It seems like she wants to do the minimum for you, and is rude. I go to this location to take my 92 y/o grandmother for breakfast, mainly because my 11 y/o son loves BE. I am seriously looking to go to another location because of this waitress. We go there about once or twice a month. I would give it a 1 but I like the food.

Jason"}
{"text":"Food is always good.  Everything is usually good but today, had the worse waiter ever. Never filled the coffees without us asking, brought all the food out in parts, my husband never got his biscuits until end of the meal, and my sausage can out last.  And there were only the 2 of us at the table."}
{"text":"Dined at this Bob Evans during a road trip. Big mistake.  I've been to many BE's before but this one is by far the worst when it comes to food quality.  I ordered the open-faced pulled pork sandwich.  The pork was so-so, the mashed potatoes were out of a box, the bbq sauce was out of a bottle and there was a HAIR in my food!  My wife's order was totally wrong - the mgr took the plate back and gave her a bowl of soup and house fries to swap.  The only good spot was the staff - everyone was very friendly and focused on making us feel welcome.  Now if they can only fix the problem in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Website says there's MSG in everything they serve. That's a nightmare for those who may be allergic or simply can't handle MSG.  Really, MSG??!"}
{"text":"Used to live down the street from this location so we went like every weekend. Always good. And you can always find a coupon. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"I don't know what the issue is, but they obviously have one at this location.  Food backed up at the window,  or not done properly.  We come here all the time but not anymore.  Too many screw ups and lousy service.  They used to be good but their standards have slipped big time"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Bob Evans in quite some time.  It was busier than I expected for lunch.  The service was fantastic and the food was very good.  I got the wild fire salad with grilled chicken and it was awesome.  My daughter had the chicken & noodles and green beans and loved every bit of it.  We got the biscuits on the side and with just a little strawberry jelly were AMAZING.  It was definitely a good meal as close to home cooked for going out to eat."}
{"text":"So the staff is super nice..(bad but nice). But wow is the food really bad. Breakfast that should be hot...guess what..it's cold..breakfast that should be cold ....it's stale...don't forget the lip gloss stains on all the drinking glasses...don't go"}
{"text":"Took my daughter's here for a Valentines Day breakfast.  We were greeted by the hostess who offered my girls fun straws.  We were seated in the resturant.  We sat and watched numerous tables cleared and set around us. After 20 minutes of waiting for any acknowledgment of our presence (there were 5 of us), we unfortunately had to leave."}
{"text":"While visiting relatives in Lorain Elyria area we always have at least one get together meal at Bob Evans, either in Eylria or Amherst. Last Wednesday we had a late lunch at the Elyria store, enjoyed a nice meal at reasonable prices, with good service. As always Bob Evans was a great value. We also appreciated the extra service that Joe, the afternoon manager, provided in splitting our check three ways to accommodate our group, after I mistakenly asked for only one check. Thanks."}
{"text":"Now i would like to start off by saying I am no Debbie downer but this Bob Evans was HORRIBLE and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it wasn't too loud, the bread was great and my waitress was good. This Bob Evans was like no other and I'm usually a fan. So I sat at the \"bar\" or single chair table, right in front of the kitchen. I. SAW. EVERYTHING! I witness another waitress eat off a tray, touch her arm pit to a plate of food and put her fingers in her mouth. There were also two girls hardly working. As for the food when I got it, it looked good but all my vegetables in my omelet were raw and fell right out. The potatoes were actually pretty good though. Would I recommend someone to go to Bob Evans yesssss but to this one Absolutely Not!"}
{"text":"We love the food, and since we don't eat pork we can always enjoy their turkey sausages with our breakfast.  I love their biscuits, and specialty breads. This particular location just remodeled and they have a tempting bakery at the front!  Manager is always around and being very helpful, as well as the staff.  Their selections are great from breakfast all day, to lunch and dinner options as well! We always enjoy our experience here!  Go ahead and dig in...you will be back!!"}
{"text":"My family has been to several Bob Evans in the past, and I have to say, this is the worst of them all!  This store should change managers immediately.  It is clearly very very poorly managed.  Here were the problems with this visit:

 1. The partitions right by the tables are filthy.  The tables right by the partitions are filthy.

2.  The restrooms (men's and women's) smell foul, strongly like urine and the toilets are very very visibly filthy!  Disgusting!

3.  Our waitress is slow.

4.  I observed the staff as being unkempt, and unhappy to a point to where I heard staff unprofessionally and openly expressing frustrations at other staff behind the seating counter, and I wasn't even sitting at the counter.

5.  Manager didn't go table to table, as good managers will to ensure everyone is taken care of.  Additionally, Veronica didn't even check on us until well after the meal was served.  We did have concerns about the food, but didn't get the chance to say anything until the meal was mostly eaten.  We were very very hungry so we ate the food despite the several problems we had with the food.

6.  The food was the worst I'd ever had at a Bob Evans!  3 of us ordered chicken strips and fries.  Everything that came out of the deep fryer was very chewy and tough, even the fries.  It all had the texture of food that was very very old, though it was hot.  The mashed potatoes had VERY little gravy.  Maybe 1/3 the usual amount.  The biscuits were old and stale tasting.  I've had many meals at Bob Evans restaurants, and this was by FAR the most unacceptable!  

7.  The cups were filthy on the outside!  Probably inside too, but I wouldn't know for sure.  My son was served a sundae with a spoon that had some sort of garbage-like paper stuck to it, as if if went through the dishwasher and it stuck to the spoon.  This was right on the handle and extremely noticeable, so how the waitress missed it is a mystery unless she saw it and just didn't care, which is the conclusion I've drawn.

In years past, maybe 10-20 years ago, Bob Evans was one of the cleanest places to eat, with very good wait staff and attentive managers.  It has since turned to almost the opposite based on this visit. 

We are not generally complainers, or picky people.  These things were all observed today, and this was a very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"Bad service- waited 25 min at table before server acknowledged us after being sad by a disgruntled hostess...  Then waited 45 min for our salad and sandwiches to arrive-  couldn't understand it as the restaurant had only one other table of customers to tend to. (Must be saying something there since it was 5:30 pm on a weekend).  Just a bad experience overall with not so tasty food and a lot of waiting...long waiting to get refills, waiting for our meals, waiting for our check, and waiting for someone to come to the register to pay. We had planned to go catch a movie after our meal but missed a 7pm showing due to slow overall service."}
{"text":"If you are in a rush, I wouldn't recommend going here.

I thought this would be the fastest breakfast option that has reasonable ingredients. After waiting almost 10 minutes at a table and not being greeted, I went to the counter and ordered out.

That even took 20+ minutes. It was just an omelette!

The staff was friendly though and the omelette was very good."}
{"text":"Yes I'm eating at chains, for meals that have to count! Breakfast/brunch always counts, and is one of the few things I'll navigate Rt 51 for. 
Grown up daughter and I made it in a little after 10 on a Saturday, waited 5-10 minutes for a booth. Becky was our server, super friendly, and so thorough on the specials. Farmers Choice breakfast times two was our order, daughter got the crepe with blueberries, and I settled for hot cakes.
There was a bit of a wait for the food, but not our drinks which is understandable with a packed house. Our breakfasts were good, my bacon not cooked well done, and crispy but I tend to cut slack on small things like that since everything else was fine. 
I had a craving for chocolate cake during the work week, and the order of hot cakes with just a bit of syrup erased that thought from my brain, they were that good. 

Of the three Bob Evans' within my driving range, this location is easier to get too, and the service is just as good."}
{"text":"Connie is one of my favorite morning waitresses! My breakfast is always delish and my drink is never half empty with the morning crew:) stop by and give these ladies some love! 

The cook is great in the morning too!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. It was moderately busy. Waitress was unattentive and brought out one of our kids plates first...leaving the other angry for 4 minutes till theirs came out. The waitress did not bring out the food in proper order as in cole slaw first with breads to tide you over....she just brought it all out at once and then acted like it was a problem that we needed condiments. Refills were hard to come by also. The woman's bathroom was horrible and didn't have soap as it appeared the regular one was broken and they had no more in a little bottle they had placed on the counter. So I had to go out and ask for soap...after quite a wait, the manager comes out and appologizes, which I did appreciate but said that he was sending one of the workers to go buy more soap right now as the one was broken and they had none......so I still wanted to wash my hands and had to then have them check the men's so I could grab soap and go wash my hands in the women's. After all this it's nice to say at least the food tasted great...but how will this matter if nothing else is going right there? This is my second visit to them recently that has not been a good time, which is sad as it used to be a nice stop."}
{"text":"This restaurant has went down hill fast. Came in for breakfast with my wife and child, hostess looked at us like we had three heads and rolled her eyes, then she disappeared. We waited another five minutes before decided to go to another restaurant. Sadly we will not be back."}
{"text":"It's what you expect , decent food at a OK price the service is OK at best . I've been there a few times over the years and will be back sooner or later."}
{"text":"Sat at the table for 15 minutes no one came to take our order but employee's stopped to socialize with a table next to us"}
{"text":"Make your own informed decision. Went to this Bob Evans on a trip to Cleveland. 6 of us waited 30 minutes just before noon today (Saturday) to be seated.  A couple of times we were told by the hostess that she was waiting for a group to get up so they could clean the tables, which we had no problem with.  The problem started when she says it would just be 2 more minutes while she put the placemats on.  Another 10 minutes and we still were not seated because the tables were not being cleaned so we finally spoke up (just then they started wiping the tables and placing the mats).  Our salads arrived WITH the meal.  One soup (bean) was missing so our server went to check.  Finally, a guy came out and said it's an unpopular soup so it was frozen but he would go back and check on it.  It finally came out when we were finished eating.  The point is the service on this visit was terrible. The food was fine, just bad service.  Another manager did offer a discount as he was shocked at what happened. As we were describing our situation to him, the hostess chimed in and then started laughing.  (Thank you to that Manager). Very unfortunate for anyone working there that actually tries."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service.  Food was ok, typical Bob Evans, but the service was atrocious.  The server threw the bill down on the table when she brought the food and never came back.  It's not like they were busy at all, but she would not even look at us again.  I wanted a glass of water and would have liked coffee and dessert but it wasn't happening.  So we sat there for about 15 minutes with all the dirty dishes piled on the table and left vowing never to go back."}
{"text":"Filthy bathroom, over cooked eggs, microwave warmed up bacon, stale biscuits, doughy pancakes topped with telephone pole syrup...you know tapped right from the telephone pole instead of a maple tree!  Bob Evans used to be pretty good"}
{"text":"Hostess are 100% unorganized. Given a 15 minute wait time with one other party of 2 siting and waiting. After 30 minutes of waiting and watching other people after U.S. Get seated I said some thing. They said we where next. Well we weren't 30 more minutes went by. Spoke to a manager who cleared a table for us taking an additional 10 minutes. Then the unbelievable happened the hostesses sat another party at the table the manager cleared. The party they seated they seated couldn't believe it as well and quickly offered their seats to us. We said thank you but turned it down and then left without being served."}
{"text":"Your typical Bob evens.. Breakfast was good. Busy for breakfast like always on a Saturday morning but wasn't a horrible wait. Over all service of the wait staff was average nothing above and beyond average but not below either. The store seemed to flow customers through smoothly and quickly"}
{"text":"This was without a doubt one of the worst dining experiences of all time for our family.  We were made to wait 20 min to be seated in a mostly empty restaurant and the hostess only seated us because we asked someone else for help.  When she did seat us she threw our menus on the table and stomped off!  The waitress was sweet but it took 20 more min for drinks and 30 more for the food.  The only positives were the waitress being nice and the food quality.  The same hostile hostess was very polite to another customer paying before us and absolutely hateful towards us.  It was obvious she had a problem with our group and it was personal.  I hope the manager reads this because it needs to be addressed.  We will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I am updating my review from 2 to 3 stars.  My original is below from Aug 2017.  We recently went back and the service was much better and the food was fresher.  Everyone was hustling and servicing the customers. 
 As a reference, here is the original review:  We are regulars at this restaurant.  Unfortunately, we have seen a decline in the last few months.  Slower service, sausage tastes saltier, the entrees are getting smaller and a little less care in the food prep. .Sometimes you will see young wait staff standing around while tables need to be bussed.  The staff is always polite.  Expect more of these problems during busy times.  Non-peak times will be OK.  I do hope they start some improvement.  If they do I will post a new review...."}
{"text":"Enter this place had a 5 minute wait not bad
Get a table good
2 dirty tables around us for 15 minutes or more 
Had to get own sugar and hot water, napkins
No refills on drinks 
Set an elderly couple down at a very wet table
Also silverware had food particles on them

Oh well no more bob evans"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I saw the prices for the breakfasts and thought they must be really good to charge that much. $10 for eat n park smiley breakfast equivalent w/ sausage gravy on the side. The bacon was old and tough, the  home fries frozen potatoes and the eggs were ok. The sausage gravy was dark brown and not that good. Would not recommend bob Evans. Over priced and poor quality."}
{"text":"Waited over 20 minutes and our server still had not come to say hello. It is a quiet evening so there is no excuse for that. We got up and took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I discovered today that I do not like Bob Evans!
Our server was kind. However she didn't know anything about which coupons were acceptable or not. She brought only our menus when she first came to our table. I was very thirsty and would have loved to of had a glass of water brought to my table with or before my menu. However Bob Evans doesn't do this. Infact unless a customer request a glass of water they don't bring them out at all.

Next when my sister tried to order chicken strips we were informed they were out of chicken strips and mac & cheese. Evidently that wasn't all they were out of. Because when I ordered what they call a fruit bowl it was only grapes and musk mellon. That was just disappointing. 
After searching for any coupons available for Bob Evans I finally found a few. By the way it is extremely difficult just to find ten coupons for Bob Evans. When I brought several different ones up to the register the manager informed me that everyone of them was unacceptable? for one reason or another. These websites are very reliable and I use coupons from them all the time at other restaurants and stores! But this place is insanely determined to charge full price.
 In general this whole fustrating experience sucked. It sucked because of how this Bob Evans is ran. The policies and lack of quality is why it gets one star. Not because of the employees. They did their best.
Also, the food wasn't anything special. It's really heavy on cheap carbs. They offer grilled chicken breast and ice burg lettuce as about the only remotely healthy options. Oh yes and let's not forget the \"fruit bowl\"...
(See picture)
Overall I left here feeling ripped off, agrevated, tired, and certain that I just do not like Bob Evans at all."}
{"text":"We ordered beef vegetable soup but it wasn't satisfying for the bowl price of $3.99. The beef was tender but the vegetables seem undercooked. We felt that for the price, we could have gotten more."}
{"text":"My family decided to go to Bob Evans for breakfast because my daughters boyfriend had never been there before. Well we were seated at 1215 . Placed our order. 1 1/2 later our food came out cold. So the manager had our meals recooked. The second time it came out. We were missing items from our meal. IE. pancakes , bacon , toast. So they were reordered. By the time they came out we were finished with the first part of our meal. The manager gave us 20% off the bill. Very frustrating. Spent 3hours there ."}
{"text":"I came into to bob evens couple days ago to get food to go and I sat there for 20 min with no help to be seated or to acknowledgement of being there. If you a a hostess podium out then you need a hostess, if you do not take it down. I tried again today and I got seated it only took ten minutes but I got seated. I think I'm going to go play the lottery I might get lucky lol 

Third time in here since staying in the motel down the street got seated but been sitting here waiting for a waitress to ask me what I want to eat or drink for 15 min for the love of god management sucks at this place worst bob Evans in the USA period"}
{"text":"This is the worst Bob Evans I've been to.  It took over 2 hours and they were out of everything. They were out of Spinach, jalepeneos, home fries, pumpkin bread, orange juice, dinner rolls, and even french fries!!! I would not recommend going to this location."}
{"text":"Met a friend for breakfast mid morning on a weekday. The place was not crowded. Our waitress was very impatient for our order. Not sure if she was at the end of her shift or hoping for a quick turn on
Her table. When asked for a glass of water she actually asked if we wanted it \"to go!!!\" Honestly we weren't there that long."}
{"text":"I love Bob Evans from the second I walk in and smell their amazing food. I get the Farmers breakfast ever time I go for breakfast. Their servers definitely make sure you're taken care of and don't leave with disappointment. Can't wait to go back once again."}
{"text":"I had breakfast this morning my waitress Sydney she was great coffee good with the cream I like my chicken fried steak I will be back"}
{"text":"I really hate that I couldn't have been able to come on here and just rave about our meal at Bob Evans but it would have been true. We had breakfast and the food was cold and the gravy and grits tasted like the chlorine water that they were made with. You could also taste it in the dry biscuits that we were served. The best thing about the whole experience was the hot coffee and the nice waitress that kept our cups filled and offered to-go cups. That was worth the two stars."}
{"text":"I would of gave them a review if i did not walk out.waited for20 mins and no-one even came to take order.horrible service"}
{"text":"Woke up early so i decided to have breakfast at Bob Evans. As others have said the customer service is lacking quite a bit here. There wasn't many people there at all and i still had to wait to be seating. Not sure where the hostess took off to.
I new exactly what i wanted for breakfast so i didn't think it would take long to get food. It took several minutes for the waitress to come to table. I was ready to order everything but she asked if i wanted coffee and took. It took her a while to get back with the coffee and i told her i was ready to order. At that point i just wanted my coffee and food and get out. The food itself was good. Next time i think I'll try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great job tonight. Great service and food and we appreciate your taking the time to help the community with your fundraiser. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and every time I have ordered a bacon and cheese omelet due to how good it is. It is the best omelet I've ever had and the service is good 9 out of 10 times which is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Bob Evans many times before, but I have never been served burnt food until today at   This Bob Evans  When the waitress brought out my food she made An attempt to still present this travesty of a meal, she said while placing it on the table they were re making the potatoes. I am floored as to why there was an effort at all to serve burnt food! When they brought out the food the second time around it was undercooked this time! At  that point I was done with this restaurant!  And to add insult to injury the manager act as if he could not comprehend as to why I was dissatisfied. I will never eat here again!!!!"}
{"text":"While in the area, I ate at this Bob Evans. I ordered the turkey dinner with dressing, green beans, mashed potatoes and gravy. There were two warm rolls with this also. It was delicious. The waiter,Nate , was friendly and excellent .
  I would recommend this place for tasty food at a fair price.."}
{"text":"The server was good. My husband doesn't eat outside meat for religious reasons so he ordered the garden harvest omelet. In it, he found a couple pieces of ground sausage and a piece of plastic wrapping or casing of some sort. Then they double charged us for the omelet instead of taking it off as they said they'd do. Prob won't be coming back for awhile.. At least not at this location. :( Mine n kids food was ok."}
{"text":"Terrible service. No coffee or drink refills offered. Husband asked to hold the onions with his meal but got onions anyway. Had to hunt the waitress down for the bill. Complained to the manager on duty who was not very responsive."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst Bob Evans out there.  Today was my second time there, but first let me start with the first time.  Our waiter, Carl served us our water, my daughters with lemon.  She squeezed the lemon, then noticed that her glass had green onions floating it it, so she asked for another glass.  He returned the glass without the onion and magically the previously squeezed lemon was back up on the rim of the glass - he had to have touched it!  Gross!  Service was terribly slow despite only having a few other patrons.  Food was normal - average.

Fast forward to today's visit.  There were 4 of us and the host sat us at a 1/2 dirty table with a bunch of food on the floor.  There were only 2 other tables seated in the entire restaurant.  After sitting unattended for about 5 minutes, Carl comes over to greet us with 3 sets of silverware.  This man must really HATE his life - he is so unfriendly and not personable at all. We ordered our drinks, 1 coffee, 1 hot chocolate, 2 waters.  Then he was gone for about 5 minutes when he returned with our drinks and said he would be right back.  About 8 minutes later he finally came back to take our order.  15-20 minutes later our food arrived.  (Carl did not check on us in the meantime). At this point, we asked for refills on our drinks.  He brought us a refill on the coffee only.  So then I asked for a refill on the hot chocolate and waters, he only brought the hot chocolate - so we asked for a refill on the water, at which time he asked \"is there anything else before I leave?\" You can tell he was irritated.  

He NEVER came back after bringing the water and the check.  
Food was kinda tasteless and he over charged for one of our meals and never brought us our biscuits that were supposed to come with one of the meals.  

Do yourself a favor and drive a coup,e extra miles to go to the next closest Bob Evans - cause this one is terrible!"}
{"text":"Waitress was great but the breakfast was awful. Eggs over easy were running and the hashbrowns were undercooked and cold. Bacon was good and so was the toast."}
{"text":"Never got our food after 45 minutes. Manager could not explain why and really didn't care. The restaurant was not busy either. We finally walked out. Will never return to this location."}
{"text":"We stop by this location close to once a week. I absolutely love everything I have ever ordered off the breakfast menu. Have yet to be unhappy with anything that has come out of their kitchen. The coffee is good and strong and I appreciate being brought a pot for the table so I don't have to wait for a refill. Most of the wait staff is friendly and efficient. The prices are fair, especially considering there are almost always coupons in the mail. We will continue to visit this location frequently, I would say the only drawback is the small parking lot bc there have been several times we were unable to find a parking spot and had to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The prices are so affordable, the sevice is always great, and the food is pretty good. Tonight I got country fried steak, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, salad, cinnamon bread, and a Caramel sundae for $9.99. That's incredible! I really like this location and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my father. Next time I'll make the drive to Brunswick. The service and food is much better there.  Waited 20 minutes for a table and it wasn't even that busy on a Monday afternoon. The waitress brought my Dad his ice tea. It kept leaking on the table due too a cracked glass. Finally brought another glass, but the waitress never asked if we wanted a refill. The chicken sandwich we had was fatty. Beef vegetable soup was not very good. Never have these issues in Brunswick. Won't  go back to this location."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and it was hands down the best service I have ever received at a restaurant. The food was perfect and it came out quickly. There was no complaints to be had with my food. If you come and when you come. You should get Jody to be your waitress. She was amazing and was so nice! She asked us if we were full she gave us plenty of food options and even took another order last minute to go and gave us the best bacon she could get! I definitely recommend her and she is the best waitress I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I just left Bob Evans and I am seriously disappointed.  Our server Destinee was very pleasant but not very good at her job.  She delivered our food without noticing we didn't have silverware.  She brought out our order incomplete and never returned with the rest. After complaining to management she sent someone else to the table with the check. A simple I'm sorry would of been nice. Since I'm in the business I still would of left her a tip if she had done so.  It's sad that my dad who loves Bob Evans probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"I get breakfast every now and then, and I'm only ever there in the morning. I'm rating this place 3 stars because the food is good, the environment is as good as you can expect from a restaurant, and I've only had a problem once before. If I had to choose between Denny's and Bob Evans, I would choose this."}
{"text":"Once again good food and a great place to meet friends. Coffee comes in your own pot and the service was superior."}
{"text":"My salad was not good. Grilled chicken was not fresh. Funny taste. Strawberry bread fake. My hubby's  burger was not exceptional like the waiter said. Gave 1 star for the waiter she was nice and friendly. Will not return."}
{"text":"I ordered the Family Dinner to go - Says for Family of 4.  No way do they give you enough food for 4.  one container of potatoes, one container of the pot roast and the container was the same size as when i order a Meal for One -  disappointing with the amount of food.  Won't go that route again.  Food is good and this time my To Go order was on time AND everything was there.  If you order To Go - make sure everything is there before you leave.  3 out of 4 times they have left something out."}
{"text":"I love Bob Evans. But the last few times I've been here the quality of the food has gone down.  Portions are not consistent. And the dishes had to be sent back becuase the were dirty. And this is during the week, so they aren't even busy."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of eating breakfast for Dinner and this is the place to go to.

Bob and Jewell Evans really knew what they were doing.  Food is outstanding love the atmosphere and its a great family place.
Breakfast Lunch or Dinner........"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I continue to visit this location because not one single visit was good. Today was the final straw, I will never visit this location again. I watched 2 different guest sit in the same spot, order, eat and leave before we received our food. Our waitress didn't even apologize, we also had to wait for her to give us our check so we can leave. 

There's always been small things, incorrect amount on the bill, 2 pancakes instead of 3, never refilling coffee, dry stiff pancakes, the list can go on. But we get a credit to come back and experience a new problem. Today, I didn't even say a word, what more can I complain about to make a difference. 

The only thing this location is consistent at is poor service."}
{"text":"If there was a half star I would have given it. Carl was our server and what a miserable and rude human being. Unfortunately he set the tone for our visit and just made everything horrible. We were visiting our grandfather that lives near by and decided we would go for an early dinner. The food was OK. But every single server was sub par. Two young girls were hanging on a kitchen helper as he put soup in the container. AND we could hear our lovely server Carl complaining behind the wall. And I'll be darned if he didn't screw our order up and then huffed when asked to correct it. Unreal! I didn't make you take this job! I am so angry over this visit!!"}
{"text":"I would never ever ever ever visit this location again. We came in when there were 4 other tables, all with food. The hostess sat us at a table in the back a few tables away from a party of seniors already eating. We waited 27 minutes and still no one ever came to our table, not the server waiting on the ladies nor anyone else. I observed the manager and the hostess who sat us along with several servers laughing and joking near the beverage area. We finally left when the same hostess sat another table between us and the seniors and they were greeted and drinks ordered within 30 seconds of sitting down. We demanded to see the manager who only offered to have us sit for a free meal which we declined.

Avoid this location at all costs if you care about where you spend your $$$ and expect service for your buck"}
{"text":"Oy vey. The time in my life has come where I'm reviewing a Bob Evans.

Here's the tIhing: T.G McFunster's are not only convenient, but often necessary, when going out with an infant, and especially when you're in the company of other mothers. Which is what happened yesterday when the baby and I were on a mom-date with four other families.

So, Bob Evans it was! It was my first time at this chain. For those who haven't been, it was sort of like a Friendly's or a Perkins. Not my cup o'tea, but the other thing is, you've got to know what to order.

In other words: you don't order shrimp scampi, or salmon, or chicken francese. You don't even really want to order an omelette. What you do is you order stuff that would be ok anywhere. I had the soup and salad combo, a STEAL at $4.49, and I chose chicken noodle soup and a side salad with ranch (NO CHEESE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, and no bacon -- because here, it would be more like Bacos). It was more than fine. The soup was really good. Again, think about what you would order at a diner, and order that.

My meal came with a choice of either biscuits, rolls, or a couple other choices. I got the rolls. GOOD CHOICE. They were hot, fluffy, and huge.

The other good thing is that the waitress was very kind, not annoying, very quick, AND brought us all separate checks without us having to ask, because she could sense that five different families were there and would probably have to get up and go at a moment's notice. Which is pretty much exactly what happened.

I'm not saying it was amazingly great or anything. But sometimes you gotta make some sacrifices. I am learning this. Reluctantly. Sometimes you gotta go to a T.G. McFunster's to satisfy not only your  own group, but also the diners around you. So be it! For these reasons, Bob Evans serves its purpose."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. The waitstaff is consistently cheerful. This location needs a manager who manages. It takes too long to be seated. Today it took longer to pay than it did to receive my food. It is as if the customers are a nuisance."}
{"text":"I can never give Bob Evans anything below 5 stars. I love Bob Evans not only for their food, but for the memories they give me regarding the times I spent with my family during the winter in Cleveland.

Bob Evans is probably the best place I've ever been to for a solid American breakfast. Their eggs, sausage links, and ESPECIALLY their biscuits and sausage gravy are delicious. You can feel that homey aura in Bob Evans, and all their food is cooked with that homey care.

This beats out Denny's and other breakfast diners I've been to COMBINED. My entire family loves it, and so do I."}
{"text":"Very Slow service.  We have a party of 5, wouldn't recommend coming here unless there are just 2 to your party"}
{"text":"I have been there several times over past few years and the service has always been very good. The servers are usually in good humour and very pleasant, with no attitudes. We go there for breakfast primarily; and my most recent visit (last Sunday June23 2013) was only OK as far as food goes. Two complaints # 1 The coffee is horrible! Whatever \"new & improved\" blend they're using...ditch it! Too strong & dark for me! Maybe it was just that brew batch; but it sucked. My wife who is a huge coffee drinker agreed 100%. Issue # 2 The home fries (cubed) were hard 50% of the time, which I hate. I've been to other outlets like Perkins etc. where they are much better. They have re-vamped the entrance to this location, removing the counter from just inside the front door; which is a good improvement. Overall just 2 stars, and will probably avoid this location from now on."}
{"text":"Ahh since I am on an out of state trip with other wrestlers in from Northern California. So we went to the local la quinta across the street and we decided to go here. Then we came here and so far the ambiance is very nice. Same thing with the waitresses and waiters they are very nice and follow carefully of your order. The pricing is average and seems like the staff are determined to work at this place. I do suggest you go here~"}
{"text":"Staff is either new or needs training - got numerous things wrong- my cup of sausage gravy was a bowl, the veggie omelet had a cube of ham in it. Ice and silverware seem to be in shortage because we had to ask for both three times.

My wife's order included hash brown, which were forgotten - even after the server asked twice about what kind of potatoes did she want with the breakfast.

The food was lukewarm and generally ok.. just took forever to get it."}
{"text":"Wanted to have a nice breakfast with my family. We decided to come here. Worst choice ever. We walked in and waited to be seated. It took 5 minutes to be acknowledged.  This is also after either the manager and host walked by. (Which both straightened up the menus that were right next us.) My boyfriend and I looked at each other and said loud enough, \"it looks like they do not want our money today.\" We promptly left and went to Dennys, which if I may add, we were promptly seated and waited on.  Will never go back to this location!"}
{"text":"The food is just terrible. Like cafeteria food, everything comes from a can (green beans) or box (mashed potatoes). It was pretty busy so someone likes this slop, but not me!"}
{"text":"Bob Evans' delicious breakfast sausage makes Jimmy Dean's taste like a pale also-ran. It was the only sausage my family ate growing up, and I miss it like the dickens.  Bob later opened a chain of family-style restaurants featuring all-day breakfasts and hearty pseudo-country meals, mostly located near expressway interchanges.  They are a reliable place to grab lunch or dinner if you are hungry, tired, and not too picky about superfresh veggies.  Stick with breakfasts and you're golden, although I always liked their chicken-n-noodles dish."}
{"text":"What happened to this Bob Evans location? They upgraded the restaurant, but must have had no money left to hire quality staff. Stopped in early Friday, and was not greeted or acknowledged as six employees kept walking by and were busy having conversations with each other instead of taking care of customers.  The food quality has taken a dive, dry eggs, hash browns, and crepes that amounted to a plate of mush.  I know it's only breakfast but it can be so much better."}
{"text":"The food was great but service was terrible!!! I waited for server to take order for drinks about 40 min! And i left my phone on the table and when i came back after 5 min to pick it up they told me they have not seen any phones! They not only have bad service but they also steal your staff!!! Management just walked away when i asked for a help! I forget my staff constantly at restaurants but i never had a place that says oh well its your problem! What a horrible horrible service! I left them enough tip for not stealing my phone!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Horrible management.  Horrible food. It's a good thing Bob Evans is dead because he would roll in his grave if he knew how low the quality has sunken to of his beloved family style restaurant. Another well respected family establishment has bit the dust. I only put a star because I have to."}
{"text":"I had turkey dinner atBob Evans on Thanksgiving day at 6:00pm in Champaign IL. One meager slice of turkey 1/8\" thick. Smashed potatoes were good. Dressing gave me heartburn not sure what was in it. Green beans were pretty good. Look at the picture of the cranberry cup l, thats how it was served, like someone ate out of it. Their excuse was that different people filled the cups, and I could have my choice of pie, except pumpkin was the only pie left and it was beyond terrible. As you can see I had a few bites but it was really the worst pumpkin I ever had. I will never go back to Bob Evans. They absolutely ruined my Thanksgiving, I had tears in my eyes after I left. I have shown dozens of people my cranberry cup. I feel bad I was stuck by myself in Champaign for Thanksgiving and not getting back to the neighbors for a real dinner in  the Chicago burbs.  Most restaurants were closed on Thursday, my choices were limited but McDonalds was open. Never ever again and its my mission to spread the word."}
{"text":"Legit one the worst experiences I've ever had with a breakfast joint. Slowest service of all time. The servers think they're heroes by trying to memorize everything you order and then they come back asking you for your order again because they forgot. Nothing wrong with writing stuff down.

I ordered coffee and the server brought out a pot of ice cold coffee. He apologized and said he would make more and bring it out when it was ready. He never did. He also charged us for it on the bill.

Girlfriend ordered hash browns with cheese on top. She specifically told the server this three separate times. Of course, the hash browns came out plain. 

The table behind us had to tell their server that we needed refills on our drinks because our server didn't pay attention to us at all. The nice folks at that table gave us better service than the people who actually work there.

Food was nothing special either. I will never ever go back to a Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Seriously !  Just left ...won't rush back! Slow, cold, and Zachary the manager does not know how to do his job!
Lacking any sort of customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Just awful. Took forever for are food. And the food portions were awful. The rolls were as hard as a rock and the food was ok but not the best. There are plenty of other bob Evans nearby. Do not come here."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service. Very friendly staff!! The only complaint I have is the hash browns tasted freezer burned. Neither my sister or myself could eat them. Everything else was good."}
{"text":"Second strike and your out last time keeping me standing at wait here counter won't be back"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Loved the 3-course deal--where else can you get warm banana bread instead of rolls? I can't think of anywhere! haha, that was the highlight of my meal. The service was a bit slow but the food was great and reasonably priced. Not only that but kids eat free on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Excellent slow-roasted pot roast, mashed potatoes,  & gravy with killer freshly-baked biscuits and strawberry lemonade. The farm-fresh \"broasted\" chicken was crispy on the outside, but tender and juicy on the inside. Great food, excellent service, friendly staff. Bob Evans is at the top of my list for traditional American eateries."}
{"text":"I did not try Bob Evans when I was in Ohio for 3 years because they looked like a not so nice comfort food place to me!! Now I am going there more than once in past month because they are really a good comfort food place but nice, at least in Indiana. 

This particular establishment has similar lay out as all others. Staff was mostly friendly and courteous. Food was not so good. Despite them following the same recipe, I felt like the food was less than ideal at this place. They ran out of Pico-de-gallo for nachos at noon!! The eggs and biscuits were nice but not as good as other places. 

I will still give them one more try for breakfast/brunch but may be not in Urbana area."}
{"text":"Decided to try lunch to go today.  I ordered the ham & swiss grilled on sourdough and vegetable soup.  It's just OK.  The ham is a fat piece of ham but the sandwich itself was not bad.  I liked the bread and the swiss cheese.  The vegetable soup was ok but it had a lot of corn in it.  The people working at the counter were very nice and the service was speedy.  I don't feel like I should change my rating because there is nothing stellar about today's visit and quite frankly I have experienced better."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast restaurant! 

I love their fruit crepes here, very delicious. There are a ton of breakfast restaurants around the area, but I think Bob Evans has the freshest ingredients. The only complaint I have is their wait for breakfast, but I guess that means their food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Slightly cute, okay service, and okay food.

Banana bread is great!

Everything else ranges from okay to awful.

Do not order the veggie omelette, unless you are interested in enjoying a full sized uncooked onion as a part of your omelette."}
{"text":"I guess it's ok for fast food.  Had breakfast, eggs were runny and unappealing."}
{"text":"Service here was a bit slower than I'm used to at Bob Evans, especially since it wasn't busy at all. Other than that, it's just like every other Bob Evans in the midwest, with all of the same menu options. A safe bet for breakfast, but there are definitely more interesting options in the immediate area (like Yours Truly on Wilson Mills or First Watch in Golden Gate, for example)."}
{"text":"I live by here and wanted it to be good and gave it a number of chances. Twice I walked out after waiting over an hour.  The hillbillies working there are yelling to each other across the dining room. The food is greasy and cold.  Its a disorganized mess.  The tables are filthy.  Even the ones they wipe down are covered in a layer of grease collected from other tables. If they do employ a manager, that person should be fired.  All these negative reviews are accurate - probably not as harsh as they should be.  Anything not negative is probably a lucky exception, or someone who works there or something. There are PLENTY of good spots in Lakewood and nearby to go to. Avoid this place.  Let it die, and hope someone who has a vague sense of what they're doing run a restaurant there."}
{"text":"Excellent experience!!! Came here for lunch for 7 people! Our waiter Joe was very helpful & patient! In my humble but accurate opinion the ice tea could have been much, much much better! The strawberry/banana smoothie was excellent! The Hash-browns were a bit greasy but fine enough for us! Their sausage gravy was excellent! Overall the adults & kids enjoyed their meal experience here!!! By the way Kids eat free on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I am old enough to remember when The Evans Family still owned this chain. Sausage gravy and biscuits were homemade. Now you get processed food. They do not cook anything anymore. Corporate food, not my style."}
{"text":"I usually love Bob Evans but I had thee worst experience here today. Ordered an veggie egg white omelette which took 30min only to come out covered in pork. Yuck. Waited 15min on a 2nd one that came out with a hair. Double yuck. Only to wait 30 min on another wrong order. Please get it together.

Update* *** the manager came over gave us half off on the meal apologized for all the mix ups and was absolutely helpful in rectifying our situation- that was so appreciated. People have the right to have bad days so I'll have to give them another shot"}
{"text":"I used to love Bob Evans.  Not sure if I've changed or they have, but I have to say I was not impressed this morning.

The sausage is still good, but everything else tasted like crap.  You mileage may vary."}
{"text":"Dont come here. It takes more than 1 hour to just get your food. We've been sitting here forever and we seriously don't even know what our server looks like yet."}
{"text":"I want this location to succeed and the space is nice... but the service is poor and no one cleans floors and tables."}
{"text":"The food here is top notch !! I haven't had a bad experience coming in here. Love their coffee drinks -- vanilla cappuccino!!"}
{"text":"Ok, let's set this up first...

My parents live in the Macedonia area and my children attend the Little Gym for class at 6:30pm on Tuesdays.  Since Bob Evans has Kid's night on Tuesdays this seemed a good way for the grandparents to have a nice dinner with the kids.
So... on 4/16/2013, we went to Bob Evans and arrived at 5:30pm knowing that we might be cutting it close, but should be able to get out in around 45 minutes to get them to class on time...

At about 5:40pm, the server came and took the order.  My kids ordered breakfast, pancakes, french toast and the like.  My father and I ordered from their $9.99 special and chose the Portabello Sirloin.

After running two of my kids to the restroom, the salads and bread had arrived and everything seems to be running smoothly.  Then, the waiting began...
Soon, it was 6:10pm and no one had been served their entrees, not even the children.  (Anyone with kids knows what this can do to the general mood of the table with three hungry children, ages 6, 3, and 1...)

At this point, our server informed us that the sirloin was not available and would we like something else.  Well, we were out of time and told her no, but could the kids get their food.  She mumbled something like an apology and then left.  Five minutes later, what I can only assume was a manager told us, \"The kitchen was behind and they just now found out they were out of the sirloin.  What would we like to do?\"  I asked if the kids could get their food and she replied, \"Yes, that doesn't take very long.\"  \"Fine, bring their food.\"

Not long must mean 15 minutes in Bob Evans land, as it took that long to get their food.  Kids were starving so it didn't take too long for them to eat, but we were already late as the food arrived at 6:30pm.  We did get them to their class by 6:50pm, but it was half over by then.

Additionally, my parents waited at the restaurant for another 15 minutes and no one came back to the table with any resolution or even a bill.  Finally giving up on getting any service, my parents left telling the cashier that they didn't have a bill because they didn't get any food.

My issue with the service is multi-layered.  One, the kitchen needs to know what food they do and do not have before 35 minutes after it was ordered.  This needs to be communicated to the front of house so it is not ordered.  Additionally, the manager was just plain incompetent.  She didn't resolve the issue, she didn't defuse the situation, she made excuses (\"the kitchen is behind\" is YOUR fault as the manager).  I have worked at three restaurants and have seen the manager and even a dishwasher pulled to work the line to get back on track.  As the manager it is YOUR responsibility to know what food is in the kitchen and to resolve the situation.  This manager should have offered us coupons to come back to get the sirloin at a later time.  By not resolving the situation, she left us with the feeling that we should NEVER go to that Bob Evans again..."}
{"text":"This Bob Evans is awful. The service is terrible.  The floor and booths were littered with crumbs.  Please don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I've frequented this restaurant for many years. Last three visits I got sick! Same problem every time The runs, and I'm being nice. Definitely helped being fast on my feet...
What's up? 
Perhaps a call to the Summit County Health Department."}
{"text":"You are apt to get hit by a handisnapper who can barely see over his Buick steering wheel. The parking lot is very, very dangerous. 

The food is down on the farm good. 

Once, while planning a date with a new gentleman caller, we were discussing hip and artisan places to go for a second date. I jokingly said we should go to Bob Evans. He paused, revealing his interest. 
We both revealed the deep, dark truth that we love Bob Evans. We had our second date here. 

We were the youngest couple by 15 years."}
{"text":"Place is garbage. Staff is clueless. Stay away from here if your looking for a quick lunch, or at any time really."}
{"text":"This place happen to be close by and the wife love their Turkey Sandwich diner.  For the most part their food is 3 star quality.  Nothing stands out but nothing excels either.  Their broasted chicken is better than KFC though, so I will give them that.  I would avoid the Mac & Cheese though. 

The place always clean and they have a manager that is always making the rounds.  So that is a plus.

Their staff, at least up front, tend to get in little cliques like a bunch if giggling high-school kids and give off the vibe that you are really ruining their evening by having them work for their pay.  It is not that the service is bad when they show up, it is getting them to show up.  I have been to this one on multiple occasions and it is always the same.

But, because it is close, I power on.  I only wish the Mgr. would clean house."}
{"text":"If you're eating at Bob Evans there's a very good chance you'll get a server who has a pretty solid background in serving. The place is always busy, but the service is good and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Our family of five eats at Bob Evans regularly. Over the years we have seen several remodels and changes to the Bob Evans brand but we've found that we've always enjoyed the down-home atmosphere and the country style cooking. Our kids have always gotten free kids meals for their birthdays and we probably eat there about six times a year.  It's not high cuisine. I have kids who love pancakes for any meal. But there are selections for everyone for lunch and dinner, good honest stick to your ribs food, great biscuits, rolls and flavored beads.  We had great service today on a busy Sunday.  My only complaint over the past six months or so has been that the WiFi has not worked for me at all ever."}
{"text":"Normally I enjoy this place and the staff is typically pleasant. I went in to pick up my order and the hostess/cashier was scratching her face, rim of her nose, and ran her fingers through her hair. She then proceeded to get rolls to complete my order. When I told her that I did not want her to get my rolls (telling her what I witnessed her do) she started to argue with me. Told me \"I used tongs.\" I then shared that her behavior was unsanitary and gross as she still touched the inside of the container, the tongs, then the inside of the drawer and she was not to place the rolls in my bag.

She walked away in disgust-really? I was very displeased with this and made the other people working the counter aware of her unsanitary habits."}
{"text":"One of the worse Valentine's Day service my friend and I received tonight at this location. The waiter was sweet and friendly but kinda ignored us towards the end of are meal. 

Are waiter Never brought are check to pay for the meal she kept talking to her employees when her customers were more important then we were oh wait it gets better. 

We been there since 6:30 already finished are meal table was cleared waiting on are to go desert Even though we ordered it to go she brought it out as we were to dine in. 

   Even though are waiter kept us waiting we were one of the last few people out a little after 8 during closing time if your waiter and staff is not going to respond to customers request then why bother working for a busy establishments that focus on people interaction 

Don't bother visiting this location I plan to have a talk with the corporate office because there no reason why a customer should not be ignored until an hours or so later."}
{"text":"Terribly slow service, the waitress literally was away from our table for 8 minute intervals. It took my young daughter and myself 25 minutes to get her pancakes and my chicken tenders.

I had a slow experience the last 2 times, I will not go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service and the meal was excellent. Have Jerry make you a cranberry chicken salad and you will be in for a real treat!  Well done Bob Evans for hiring such great people."}
{"text":"This location is the worst bob evans. I came here in 2014 had horrible service for 6 months so I stopped going here and took the extra trip to the Brook Park Rd location. Well,  I decided to give this one a try again since I live down the road. I ordered a single breakfest at 11:45. Online told me it would be ready at 12. It's 12:21, I still don't have my food. This is awful."}
{"text":"Good food, mediocre service. This was my first experience at a Bob Evans and it was just okay. The actual restaurant is fairly clean as it seems that it's fairly new. Typical diner fare (think Denny's or IHOP) and out server behaved like a stereo-typical waitress out of TV - loud and somewhat cavalier. 

Our food took a LONG time to arrive and when it did, one of the entrees was wrong. Had to wait longer for the correct one to arrive. The saving grace was that it was good. 

I think the only way I'd eat at Bob Evans again is if I had no choice."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good, they vary the menu often enough to keep it interesting. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable, the decor is pleasant, comfortable, and appropriate to the type of family restaurant. Overall, dining at Bob Evans is always a good experience."}
{"text":"Good service but the food was bad. Got serves shrunken carrots and the manager took them back and insulted me by taking only $3 off the bill. What a shame !!"}
{"text":"I wrote the Corporate Customer Relations team at Bob Evans about this location.  They were kind enough to send me a personalized letter and three $5 coupons to use at any Bob Evans.  They also said they will contact the local team leader to address the issues I wrote about in my letter.  Let's hope this location turns itself around."}
{"text":"The service was so bad  table walk out they took so long"}
{"text":"Dinner for four. Service was great, the place was clean, the food was delicious and affordable. I had no complaints."}
{"text":"This is second time i have visited this location. Our waitress seemed overworked, busy and missing small things. We did not even recieve silverware until after 20 minutes. I decided to keep it simple so I ordered the grilled cheese. After a decent wait (not too bad) we got our food. My grilled cheese was sitting in front of me and it wasn't even cooked at all. The only reason I knew this is because the cheese was still slices and cold. Our waitress didn't say anything other then I'll take it back. She returned 8 minutes later with a cooked sandwich that was perfect.

Overall: okay."}
{"text":"Our service is always hit or miss but the food is always to their standards.   One of the last times we were here we waited an HOUR for our food and that was absurd!  It was the only time its happened and I'm not sure what was to blame - we certainly got no apology from our waitress.  Other than that, we enjoy it."}
{"text":"I just went with my grandparents and I got the  chicken and the Mac and cheese and it was delicious. I love this place please go"}
{"text":"This is the place for breakfast if you are going out.  The sausage and biscuits are the best.  It is a great place to met friends and catch up on the weekends."}
{"text":"We thought we'd treat our parents to breakfast for their 45th wedding anniversary this morning. We placed our orders with no event, the place was about 1/2 full. After waiting around 50 minutes for our food we called the manager over asking if we could at least get the kids' food, she brought that out immediately and said the rest will be out shortly, our food came about 5 minutes later. The food was completely cold, not one of us even had a remotely warm plate of food, the hash browns with cold grease mixed in were shocking, sausage with cold hard fat etc, you get the picture. So we called the manager over again to point out the cold meals, she offered to bring us new plates of food...really? Spend another hour waiting? So she heads off to the kitchen and comes back to tell us they forgot to turn the warming lamps on and gives us $10 off on our tab of around $60.
I can't say how they should've fixed it for us but if we hadn't waited 55 minutes for the food it might've still been warm even with no warming lamp.
The worst is that the family wanted to go to Cracker Barrel for breakfast but I sold them on Bob Evans...my mistake, won't do that again."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Bob Evans but for some reason at this location the food is not so good and the service is lack luster."}
{"text":"This was a nice breakfast choice. My wife and I went to this place because it was close to our hotel and a short wait for service. The scrambled eggs with cheese were amazing and made me wish I ordered more. The biscuits tasted good as well. The hashbrowns were also good. I ordered cheese grits, but they tasted sad. So I just took two bites and gave up. My wife ordered coffee and had to request regular sugar for her coffee. Overall the staff was friendly and service nice but some dishes are okay not great."}
{"text":"Bob Evans, specifically this location, has almost always been excellent.  The food/menu has that Pseudo home cooked feel and for the most part they nail it perfectly, in some ways better than Eat N Park.

Between Denny's, Eat N Park and Bob Evans I think Bon Evans wins the battle of the 3 if I had to choose, especially breakfast options.  The food almost always comes out looking exactly like the picture on the menu.  The different omelet bowls they have are my favorite.  If it's too late for you for your breakfast (which is impossible), they have good dinner options.  Fresh warm sweet rolls, excellent appetizers and always green salads are only the start.  From Excellent Pot Roast to burgers and my personal favorite the Turkey Dinner similar to thanksgiving (my favorite meal of the year).  They have classic dessert options like warm cookies and sundaes, nothing fancy but enough to satisfy your sweet tooth.

Two recommendations that might seem way off subject that I like here are the cole slaw and the green tea brand they use.  They also as a bonus have excellent potato soup.  

The price is more than fair (25-35$ for two) and the place is usually pretty clean.  Service is not as good as the food, but this place is always pretty just when I go in, so that must be a good thing.  If you're in the area and want something with a home cooked feel, hit up Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Love Bob Evans, hated to see the one at Concord Mills go, but I'm glad they still have this location in the Charlotte area. Great home cooking with fresh vegetables and some great breakfast. This location definitely outperforms most of the other Bob Evans in the area that I have been too, so it's definitely worth stopping in for a meal."}
{"text":"It was my first time at a location for this chain.  In terms of a southern themed breakfast, for me, it was just okay.  Maybe being the child of parents from the south and having authentic home made breakfast lovingly made by mom makes my standards quite high.

My waitress was friendly even if she was a bit jumpy.  I wasn't sure why and didn't put much time into figuring it out as this was the first morning of my road trip heading west from NYC.  

I had one of their omelets with sausage.  It was okay but nothing that was so good that I'll seek it out again.  It was tasty, hearty, and filling.  However, both I and my mom make a better breakfast."}
{"text":"i'm not sure why i'm so irritated but it started when we walked in. The lobby was full of people waiting to be seated. a family of 5 that came in after us was seated almost as soon as they came in but it was a 15-20 minute wait for everyone else. i get that the table was a larger table and it was empty but it just sends a crappy message to those waiting long before my girlfriend and i got there.
when we were seated we waited about 10 minutes before any server greeted us then we ordered coffee and our breakfasts. the coffee carafe/dispenser was dirty with crud all over the top. my girlfriend's cup looked to be dirty on the outside.
our breakfasts came and i was stunned to see that neither the cook nor the server noticed that, while my girlfriends' breakfast came w/ a whole order of hash browns, i only got what appeared to be a 5th of an order - basically the crunchy top and then some of the black grill gunk mixed in. again, it was ridiculous that this was served. why no one looked at it and said that it needed more hash browns has me baffled and perturbed. also, my plate w/ my french toast had what looked like chocolate smeared all over the plate and even on the bread.
the manager came over as we were getting ready to leave and asked the obligatory \"how was everything?\" and i told him. while he offered to adjust my bill i declined and just decided to avoid this Bob Evans again in the future. if in the area we'll try Perkins instead."}
{"text":"I was looking for something convenient to hotel, delicious, and a place with options. This place has all of the above. The service was good and my food was very fresh and not greasy. The amount of food I got for the price I paid was very good and I got served a lot more than expected. I ordered to go and did not have to ask for eating utensils, ketchup, or syrup. Like I said service was good. I will be returning during my trip:)"}
{"text":"Had a very nice waitress, too bad it was the only one there during the breakfast rush. We waited a long time for our food and when it came the eggs were way under cooked very gross. They did redo the eggs but the breakfast experience wasn't good, thank goodness for the nice waitress she tried hard and kept a smile on her face and a positive attitude. Don't recommend this Bob Evans"}
{"text":"Food took forever to come out and we were not offered refills on our drinks while waiting 30 minutes for our food while there was only 3 other seated tables. By the end of our meal there were 12 dirty tables around us including 3 that were dirty when we were seated. The server was goofing off with another and could not clear any of the plates off our table."}
{"text":"We waited for 10 minutes until someone finally came over to our table. The service was horrible. Food was not very good either. It came out luke warm. Then the waitress disappeared again for another 10 minutes. She came back smelling like cigarettes. Very frustrating experience with a newborn and a four-year-old."}
{"text":"Wasted money, spoiled family gathering.  

After waiting an hour for our food (we had to go looking for our server to ask if the food that was sitting in the warmer was ours), our food was finally brought to our table by our apathetic server, who merely said, \"sorry about that\" as she passed the cold plates to the wrong people.  One person sent her food back because of poor preparation, and the others picked at their cold, boardy pancakes and dry omelets. We should have sent it all back.  We had to search for our server for refills and waited (and waited) for them to come.

Besides the incredibly poor service, the food was badly made. The multi-grain pancakes had cinnamon in them and whipped cream on top. The omelet I ordered was overcooked before they folded the filler cheese and veggies into it. Others got the same, and the 20 min or so that the food sat under the warmer did not improve things.

There was no visible manager, plenty of kitchen and serving staff, and the restaurant was not full. We were not asked how our meals were at checkout, and there were no comment cards anywhere.  This used to be one of our favorite local restaurants, but I doubt I'll return anytime in the next few years."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Bob Evans before and always enjoyed the food.  Despite the 10 other customers in the restaurant the food took 25m from order to table.  No one ordered anything fancy unless you consider dry toast fancy.  The food was good but my time is valuble, I go in for breakfast and don't expect to spend 45m there."}
{"text":"the location has private parking, there is a insane wait for a table even during the lunch time, this is definitely like a crazy chain of restaurants.

the coffee was not great at all. Burned tasting coffee!

the staff is very friendly, we had a sweet older lady bringing us the terrible coffee but I loved her. the waitress was friendly butte was not good with the orders. 

Ordered over medium eggs got over easy and she said that I Was not able to swap home potatoes to toast but I was able to with into Mac and cheese, a plate of breakfast, just insane 

Mac and cheese taste like box mac and cheese, I was not very happy to see that a \" home cooked\" place had so much box and can taste on their food and drinks. 

this is definitely not a home cooked meal they serve here. 

to top it all they messed up my friend order and when they fixed it was not quite what she wanted either, but she just took it.

she initially asked for her omelette with bacon, first it came with none, when she asked about it, they remade it with bacon bits.... not even a couple of bacon slices, she was not very happy about the experience I am sure of that.

we will not come back."}
{"text":"Maybe it was too busy at Lunch time. Maybe the young man helping me was new. Maybe this is a one time slip up and they will be better next time. I ordered with a group and no one in the group either got what they wanted or had the complete meal. My loaded baked potato soup was not loaded, no bacon, no chives_just soup. The breaded mushrooms had no sauce with which to mask the fact that the mushrooms were old. And when we called back to complain the manager seemed nonplussed by the whole ordeal. She offered to give replacements but our lunch hour was over at that point.  Will not be going back there any time soom."}
{"text":"Worst BOb Evans ever!!!!! Food great, service stunk. Will be back to BE but not this one. Cups never refilled, waitress unattentive, and complaints to management went unresolved. Need customer service 101 training here ASAP."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff! This was a first time experience at a Bob Evans and it was great will definitely be back.. the only problem was the lines but I guess with good food it's expected!"}
{"text":"Look, Bob Evans is always clean, always. They get very high regards for this. Also, the service is almost always quite good. The quality of the food is also above average. I would go as far as saying the sausage patties are very good.  My issue though is the cost. It's hard to have a few eggs, sausage and coffee for under $15. 

I go here about 20 Days.  If they came out with a deal where you get two eggs, sausage and coffee for $4 I would come here every day of my life and they would make a mint off me."}
{"text":"A friend and I did 'curb side pick up' a few weeks ago. We ordered the Broasted Chicken Sandwich and 2 Cobb Salads. The final bill was well over $20.00. When we got home, my friend started on their Chicken Sandwich and then asked me what broasted Chicken was. I explained and they said that's what they thought it was but their sandwich wasn't broasted chicken, it was fried. I told them to call Bob Evan's but they said no and that it was okay.
The following day when I opened a Cobb Salad for dinner, I noticed it was NOT a Cobb Salad. I opened the second salad and it was NOT a Cobb Salad either! I paid over $9.00 a piece for these salads and half the toppings were missing!
The salads did have chicken, bacon and tomatoes but neither salad had bleu cheese, scallions, a boiled egg or cheddar cheese!! I literally got less than half the salad I ordered and paid OVER $9.00 a piece for it!! I was furious!!
To make matters worse, I went online to submit a complaint and was unable to do tht!! When you click on the page to submit a complaint, the page is conveniently 'unavailable!'
I loved Bob Evan's Cobb Salads but I will NEVER order one again unless I'm seated inside the restaurant where I can send something as simple as a salad back to the kitchen four times until they get it right!!
I will NEVER use curb side pick up again. For crying out loud, they can't get salads and a sandwich right!! Really??"}
{"text":"What do you really expect at Bob Evans?

So I've never had Bob Evans but heard a good stories from my colleague who grew up on it. We were seated for dinner and I decided to have a meatloaf. My complains were: brought me in green beans instead of corn which they brought in later on. We had to return our plates because of cold mashed potato. The server seldom checked in so with this two issues imagine the time it took to correct it. The meatloaf was OK - it was a little burnt. I'd probably come back if I don't have any other option specifically prices were not reasonable for what the meal is. I still walked out with $20 bill for one meal."}
{"text":"***Bob Evans is in the style and price range of Denny's and IHOP though Bob Evans serves a better breakfast than those two restaurant chains; some of the food on this visit was not at the optimal temperature though***

Bob Evans is a very popular family restaurant in the Midwest (they also have several locations in the South like this one in a rural part of Charlotte).  Bob Evans is like a countrified Denny's or IHOP.  Bob Evans is most popular for breakfast, which is available all day.  Their signature breakfast item is their sausage gravy and biscuits.  Their sausage gravy is creamy and filled with sausage.  It is surprisingly spicy--at least when compared to the many gravy and biscuits places out there serving bland white milk gravy with biscuits. 

The sausage gravy at this location definitely delivered the flavor of this popular item at Bob Evans; unfortunately, the sausage gravy could have been a little hotter.  The buttermilk biscuits were similar in quality to what you would get at other Bob Evans locations.  Bob Evans' biscuits have a crunchy top, but they tend to be a tad on the dry side; the sausage gravy helps though. 

I also had their scrambled eggs, which were fine, and their crispy shredded hash browns that were topped with cheese, scallions and bacon.  Their sausage links were good and better than what you get at most chain restaurants or with hotel breakfasts.  While I liked the sausages here, I enjoyed them more when Bob Evans was a smaller chain. 

The French toast was below average.  It was not as sweet as it should have been and had a dense, undesirable center. 

Service was extremely friendly and fitting with the service you get at most Bob Evans locations. 

Prices were very reasonable.  There were several low-cost options and their bigger breakfast combinations were not too expensive and featured generous portions. 

The dining room here was simple but comfortable.  This Bob Evans also has a counter where you can buy packaged treats/items and Bob Evans syrups, pancake mix and such. 

This Bob Evans is an okay breakfast spot in the rural area outside of Downtown Charlotte.  If you head to Downtown Charlotte though, I am sure that you will find much better, more creative and more local breakfast spots. 

This Bob Evans has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space."}
{"text":"Great place. Been awhile but returned. Great food at a reasonable price. Great server kept us served well. Ole"}
{"text":"Everyone and every place makes mistakes. We ordered , and 53 min later, the wait staff brought us 1/3 of what we ordered. Cold. Wrong. And Missing. The kitchen was slow the staff said. For 53 min?

I am seating here right now and told a manager quitely and waiting for a new orders to come out. But not too happy..

UPDATE: The manager helped us to get our orders in and out. She helped us to keep our expectations for BE. Hope this place becomes better in the future."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food was mediocre and the waitress was nice.  Only two stars because as my hubby and I sat at the counter we watched the food pile up at the window and no one picked it up for a very long time!  One set of blueberry pancakes were in that window no less than 20 minutes.....managers walked by over and over again.  I even asked our waitress why no one was expediting the food...she was about 20 years old and had no idea.  I am so glad that I wasn't waiting for those pancakes...the food was getting so backed up in that window that they started putting food in another window.  I couldn't believe it...stacks of toast and eggs and pancakes and hamburgers all on top on another.  The management staff couldn't of cared less....and they seemed annoyed that I asked about it...I bet they don't want me to sit at their counter any more!  I thinks it will be Denny's in Greensburg from now on."}
{"text":"Love Bob Evans.  Had the pot roast over mashed potatoes. It was wonderful! Service at this location was excellent!"}
{"text":"\"Breakfast served all day\". Except if it's 30 minutes before closing time on a Monday night. Ordered the Homestead breakfast, which included biscuits and gravy, only to find out a few minutes later that the kitchen would not make any more biscuits for the night. The only positive experience was the apologetic and friendly waitress. It was clear the decision was made at the management level to not provide a signature item on the menu 30 minutes before closing time. Pure laziness. Will not return."}
{"text":"Good home cooking. Love the Cobb salad. Fried chicken very food. Great place for variety."}
{"text":"Yes, its a chain and I never review chains, but you know, I really enjoyed my visit here yesterday.  This place just opened up earlier this month and it was humming along nicely.  Staff were quick, polite and enthusiastic.  Decor was very modern- I was surprised, and yet still very \"Bob Evans'ish\".  I got the three piece \"Broasted chicken\" meal and it was very tasty.  Like good fried chicken.  I wonder if it is any healthier than typical deep fried chicken.  The combo including side salad, mashed potatoes, unlimited (and tasty!) biscuits and small fudge sundae was $9.99, and with a coupon, it was $5 w/ drinks and another entree order.  Quite a decent deal for that much food.  We purchased some tasty baked goods to bring home and they were good too.  

Generally, we try to frequent locally owned restaurants and not chains, but you know what?  I think that I'll be coming back occasionally.  Wish that there was a connected traffic light to help you turn left when you are exiting.  

Hope this place does well- especially with Chipotle opening up next door!"}
{"text":"Finished a weekend reunion with a quick breakfast on the way out of Ohio. I've never been to Bob Evans but its a known brand in the midwest. My breakfast test consists of: eggs hot on arrival (non-scrambled), caramelized/crunchy hash browns and a good biscuit gravy.

I chose Sausage Gravy Breakfast and two of the three areas hit the mark. The gravy seemed out of a can and wasn't seasoned enough.

Our wait staff was awesome, constantly checking on our table, refilling drinks, offering substitute options and even taking pictures for us."}
{"text":"***Bob Evans makes a savory, hearty and even somewhat spicy sausage gravy with biscuits; it is a good dish and their other breakfast options are decent too***

I think Bob Evans is really good for one dish, which is their sausage gravy and biscuits.  The biscuits are good.  They are not dry and the insides of the biscuits are light and fluffy.  The outsides are great too.  The biscuits have an appetizing color as well as a buttery and crunchy crust.

The sausage gravy is very good.  It is very creamy and the sausage flavor is good--savory and even a little bit spicy.  I have found most places feature a bland gravy for biscuits; it really ends up just being a creamy milk gravy.  Often, these other places don't really mix in the sausage that well to get that really great sausage flavor.

The french toast here is decent.  Several of their breakfast items are good like their sausage patties and sausage links, but the sausage gravy and biscuits is definitely the star attraction here.

Prices are good.  Prices at Bob Evans are similar or maybe even a little less expensive than what you would pay at an IHOP or a Denny's.

Service from my waitress was good.  She was friendly and attentive and had that twang in her voice that I have come to expect at this restaurant in this area.  Checks are paid at the front and I felt the manager/cashier was a little lackadaisical and not as friendly and welcoming as you would get at a lot of other Bob Evans locations.

In terms of decor, this Bob Evans looks almost exactly like all the other Bob Evans locations.  The outside looks like a big red barn while the inside features a dining room of a lot of booths and a counter for quick dining.  There is also a little store in the front where you can buy candy, Bob Evans pantry items and souvenirs and such.

Even though Bob Evans is a chain and a big chain in the Midwest, their sausage gravy and biscuits is a good breakfast dish.  Their other breakfast items are decent and probably better than what you would get at a Cracker Barrel, Denny's or IHOP.  If you've never been to a Bob Evans, I think it would be worth one try for breakfast.  You can probably skip lunch or dinner here, but they have a few okay non-breakfast items (and their lunch and dinner menus are less expensive than a lot of chain restaurants).

Like most Bob Evans locations, this one has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space."}
{"text":"Not the best breakfast I've ever had, and certainly not the best service...but the food was hot, prepared like we asked and reasonably priced.

We stopped on the way out of town for a day trip and I had french toast and eggs and he had a sampler platter that had lots of options...both were good and nice portion sizes.

Not a huge fan of chains for breakfast, but this one will do in a pinch.  Clean restaurant, nice location and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Horrible service! My family were sitting at the table for 15 without anyone greeting us. I had to go to the hostess and ask if we had a waitress. 45 minutes after placing our order and no sign of our waitress, again I had to ask the hostess about our food. I was finally informed that the kitchen lost my food ticket, another 20 minutes we finally got our food and it was incorrect, the waitress never came back to check us or refill our drinks. Horrible location!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast reasonable price.  Didn't have the friendliest waitress and greeter clearly didn't want to be there.  Otherwise it was fine."}
{"text":"I have not been to this Bob Evans since they first opened. I decided to go last night and was surprised by how much they have improved since my last visit. Our waitress, Mia, was excellent!!  The food was good.  I hope Mia is my waitress the next time I go."}
{"text":"This Bob Evans is our standby restaurant. We are frequent patrons, so I can give you a few pointers. First, ask to be served by Sylvia or Toni. They are  among the best waitresses in the business. They will look after you with friendliness, a hard-working ethic, and with smarts. 

I love to get the cranberry pecan chicken salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing for lunch or dinner. The chicken is roasted, and the pecans and cranberries are that something extra. They have other dinner salads as well. They have some standard dinner entrees, such as turkey and dressing, meatloaf, fish, country fried steak. My brother likes to get a hamburger and French fries. They have several kinds of burgers and other sandwiches. My mother likes to get a piece of grilled chicken with mashed potatoes. Their biscuits and dinner rolls are very delicious. For breakfast, they have many, many choices--omelets, eggs, pancakes, French toast, fried cornmeal patties, crepes, you name it . . . They serve sausage gravy and country gravy. 

A featured item is the dessert breads. Banana is served year round. They have seasonal breads too. Cherry Bread is served in the spring; pumpkin bread is served in the fall, etc.

Finally, the price is right. It's just a great place to go to get out of the house and let someone else do the cooking and dish washing."}
{"text":"Not even worth a star. Came in on a Friday night at 730. Waited 10 minutes to get seated. Waiting another 10 minutes after being seated to get drinks from the girl who seated us not a waiter. Waited another 5 minutes. Waitress after waitress walks right past. Finally got up and left. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food is great and their menu is awesome. When they opened it was always packed and we assumed that the issues with the service was due to new staff and a new operation. Unfortunately a year later it has not gotten any better. Tonight dinner took over an hour with a long wait for drinks and meals. It's clear their servers do not have good management and there isn't enough of them or enough support in the floor. I hope at some point it improves but for now we don't be going back."}
{"text":"I know that The Bobs is a busy place on Sunday mornings. But we got here early (before the church crowd) and the French toast was under cooked, but the service was real good and the server was concerned with our satisfaction."}
{"text":"My friend and I had been waiting for a table for 20 minutes.  I notice that she sat 2 couples before my friend and I.  I went up and said, \"We have been waiting and you say people who came after us!\"  Her response, I sorry we skipped over your name!\"  Ridiculous... You only have one job - to take names and seat them accordingly.   I was led to an I cleaned table and had to wait for the server to clean it off.  Then, the spoon sets my friend and I received had food stuck to it...yuck!!! So I desired to get plastic ware. I ordered a Farmers breakfast with grits. While I was about to shake some salt on my grits and notice something black inside the shaker.  It was a long strand of hair!! How did it get there?!?!?!? And so, I used the salt packets that came with my plasticware.  My grits were cooked well and tasted great, and fresh made butter really increased the flavor.  

The wait for my breakfast was very long but my food was warm!!  My meal over all was decent, however, the experience started off rough!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a big Bob Evans fan forever. I'm very excited about the new menu. The unfortunate part of my dinner is I tried the new crispy chicken and it was sub par. Over cooked the sides were to salty. We did receive great service. Believe me I will not stop eating at Bobs. One thing that we appreciate is the cleanest of the restaurants. I love the bacon cheese burgers and the milk shakes."}
{"text":"Slow!  Very slow!!!!!!

I really don't care how many staff did or didn't show up.  Seriously, it's eggs bacon and already cooked potatoes!!"}
{"text":"Today my family and I had one of our worst experiences ever with a Bob Evans. We didn't mind the wait to be seated as we expected that however it took 50 minutes to get our food. When we did finally receive it it was cold.  No one had come to tell us it was running late or offer to refill coffee. The manager on duty even helped drover our food without an apology while our server said she had gotten after the kitchen for taking so long.  Given the lack of service and a manager that clearly was not concerned, after all they had a busy morning, we got up and left without eating.  We will never step foot in that Bob Evans again and will be hard pressed to visit another one in The Cleveland/Akron market."}
{"text":"Ordered on line for two nothing big or hard.  Simple standards pot roast and hot cakes with sides of mashed potato and mac and cheese. Promised at 710p not ready at 712 when arrived.  Actually received at 718p.  Do not be in a hurry or arrive late to get on time"}
{"text":"Very rude hostess. Didn't take our names or acknowledge me for at all for at least 10 minutes. Then when an elderly couple tried to get her attention she said \"I was busy I didn't see you all\"   Then gave a rude look and walked away again. Going way downhill."}
{"text":"OMG.  Bob Evans always hits the spot with my breakfast needs.   I came here because I was up too late for my hotels breakfast, and sooo don't regret it.

I walk in to the amazing smell of Cinnamon... those tricky peeps.. so of course I got a Cinnamon burst ( which is like a Cinnamon roll all fancied up).  SOOOO good.  

I ordered the breakfast skillet which has eggs and bacon and sausage and has browns ( i was hungry)...   they brought it out and said they were waiting on biscuits, unless I wanted a different side.. um.. NO WAY... I waited and they were amazing... the best biscuits I have ever had... I would always recommend to find a way to get a biscuit into your meal :)   

This is one place I miss as we don't have them where I live now...   So much better than I hop and Denny's.   

Good thing I was doing a lot of walking after that at the airport :)  Yummylicious!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Have a group of 11.  Checked in at the desk. Basically laughed at me and said it would \"be a long time\" 30 minutes later I checked out status. They never put out name down.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Edit: December 2015

I try and give every place two chances. If after that they still aren't good, that is it and I write them off as terrible. This is an instance where the second time is not the charm and I will never return. When you go to order something off of the menu, and they take your order, only to return fifteen minutes later and explain they don't sell that is irritating.  When you order a meal with a group, and the group is receiving parts and pieces of what they ordered (not just like a soup or salad, but while parts of the meal) that is irritating. When you do order soup, and it doesn't have any broth in it (which, by the way, is what makes soup SOUP) then there is a problem, when you order eggs, and you can see the plate through the egg white and yolk, there is a chance for food poisoning.

I tried to like this place. I gave it two chances. Enough is enough and this place should be shut down before someone really gets sick. 

Original review:

Even though they just opened, I would hope that the restaurant would get better. However, my last visit from today proved me wrong. We didnt receive any silverware until ten minutes after our food arrived. I always order my meal no onions. I received what seemed like extra onions. Then my waitress changed shift in the middle and our new waitress helped us with nothing . No refills. No checking to make sure everything else was still ok. Needless to say we canceled our dessert order and drove down the street to King Kone. 

Go to a local diner in the area to ensure a better meal and better experience."}
{"text":"Service is horrendous ....  waiting forever to be acknowledged for a drink, employee attitudes, lack of enthusiasm. Awful. Takes forever to get your food. The plate is hot as hell - and the food is warm. Blah. Never going back."}
{"text":"I live close to this Bob Evans and thus, have been MANY times. It is consistently good, fast and welcoming. This chain is far better than Friendlys, Perkins or most of the other similar chains. Not sure why it has so many bad reviews. Avoid on Sunday mornings/afternoons though. It's always packed w/after church crowd."}
{"text":"The food is ok.  Hostess nice.  Cashier nice.  It's the service that is lacking. Twice.  In less than a year.  We went on a weekend in 2015.  Food ok, service stinks.  Went again this weekend.  Food good, service stinks.  And the funny thing is, I think it is the luck of the draw.  We just got a terrible waitress both times.  Our waitress took our order but forgot to bring our drinks.  Bad news when you have a coffee addict and someone who hasn't had anything to drink so far that day.  Another waitress brought our drinks.  Another waitress brought our food.  Then our waitress got the idea we were lonely.  Then it was overkill.  But we didn't get a check."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Bob Evans for lunch after half a dozen breakfast trips. Most of our breakfasts meals were good, a few times slow service. We could see from where we set there was miscommunication between servers and cooks. So back to lunch!! We were promptly seated, drinks ordered, then lunch ordered. After twenty minutes I knew a problem existed, especially when people seated after we arrived had their lunch. Then the waitress shows up and says lunch will be right out. I got cold fries, cold hamburger, black lettuce around edges. I immediately asked her how she could serve me a lunch she knew had to be sitting a long time before she brought it and black lettuce !!  Her answer was I can get them to fix another lunch. No thanks. My wife had hers so what was I to do? We could not eat together. Our pleasant time out gif lunch ruined. I wrote Bob Evans telling them my experience and so many of their locations having back food and poor service. I said look at Yelp at all your surrounding restaurants and the real poor ratings customers give them. I never got an answer but free fifteen dollars in coupons. We believe Bob Evans execs are satisfied enough with their poor performing locations. I am done with this company. Lots of others to do business with."}
{"text":"This is a correction of my post last week. Somehow a mistake made with giving this poor excuse for a family restaurant a five star rating instead of the zero it was supposed to get. Yelp shows how to edit past posts but does not work."}
{"text":"We have had a couple of bad experiences at this location. Service is extremely slow. Today at breakfast I called the manager over after waiting 40 minutes for our food. In that time we waited 25 minutes for our \"bottomless\" coffee to be refilled, too! Needless to say, it didn't end up being bottomless. The manager asked who our server was. I was taken back by this as a manager should know where  her servers are assigned, right? No. The servers apparently pick their tables. I don't know that we will be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Looks like Bob Evans has changed their recipe for pancakes. I used to love their cakes a few years ago but they are doughy now and it can't be the cook because the last couple of times I was there the pancakes were not good. The service is still great and I love their coffee but I am done with their pancakes and I would advise anyone looking for pancakes to go to Denny's."}
{"text":"This is an amazing Bob Evans!! Staff & management are unbelievably kind. Food is always amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Worst bob Evans ever!!! We went in to eat lunch after going to the movies and we just saw a horror movie and that wasn't as scary as our meal! First the waitress was taking care of another table and when she came over to us she asked for our drink order and then came back without the drinks she had forgotten them...and then while we were giving our order she decided to stop and have a conversation with that table in the middle of ordering!  We ordered the meatloaf and the pot roast and they were both over and under cooked....the carrots on the pot roast might as well have been cut and thrown on the food which it looked like it was...they were as hard as a rock...my meatloaf was burnt on top and you could only taste carbon from the burn...my potato soup was good but that was about it the pot roast my girlfriend had the meat was good but the veggies again not cooked even the onions were raw...if your making \"homemade\" food maybe it should be cooked a little too...wish I could give zero stars but can't..."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here in a couple of months, had the same waitress and I'm not sure how she's still working here. She's terrible and that's being polite. Waited about 20 mins for her to come say hi and get a drink order, then another 15 to bring us any drinks at all. She forgets everything we had to ask her multiple times for a water refill. Food is okay at best but the service is so terrible I won't be back."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here about once a month. The food  and coffee are good. The service is generally ok, but there have been times where we have waited too long in my opinion. The best thing is either the chicken and noodles or our go to -- the wildfire chicken salad. The dressing is excellent."}
{"text":"I feel silly writing a review for a Bob Evans, but I honestly love this place. I go here nearly once a week as it is near family, and the staff and food are great. As a regular, I've gotten to know a number of the waitresses a little and they're always friendly, helpful, and go out of their way to be nice to my kids. I don't think I've ever been disappointed in a meal there, and while it may not be the pinnacle of fine dining, you can't go wrong with consistent, reliable food."}
{"text":"ZERO stars!!! Waited an hour for the food..people that came in after us got their food way before us..and they did nothing to compensate us for the hour and a half wasted time of my life I will not get back!!! SUCKED SUCKED SUCKED!!!!!!   it made me put a star before I could post it...negative 5 stars"}
{"text":"I mean, it's a Bob Evans, but I think their sausage tastes better when I make it."}
{"text":"Great service but the dishes that the good came on were so dirty... There was a piece of hair in my food, fork and knife were dirty."}
{"text":"I have always loved Bob Evans' Restaurants for one thing...biscuits.  Those buttery, fluffy, warm fresh baked goodies that dreams are made of!  For the longest time my usual was an egg and cheese on those golden brown biscuits.  It is still a favorite of mine, but this time I decided to get crazy.

I ordered the tomato basil soup, and the cranberry pecan chicken salad.  Oh, and a side of biscuits.  The basil soup had just a hint of spiciness to it, and I cleaned the bowl with some of my biscuit.  It was good to know that they sold those soups in to go containers for $5 per quart.  Something to stew on for later. (See what I did there?)

The salad was full of flavor, and surprises.  After the first few bites, I was finding pieces of bacon hidden in the bottom for me!  I am a firm believer that bacon makes everything better, but if that is not your thing, keep away from this salad!

The portions were huge, as always.  I don't mind this, because now I have food for tomorrow's lunch.

The service here was a bit slow, especially considering that there were not a lot of people eating at the time we went (early evening).  However, I am willing to overlook this because the food was fresh, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Seriously, every time we order from Bob Evans curbside it is always 20 minutes late and they ALWAYS forget something, like c'mon."}
{"text":"The service was awful and my food was cold! Beachwood and Solon are the worst locations. Let's start with the wait. It took 10 minutes to be seated and another 5 minutes for the server to greet us at the table. Then, as I am ordering she tell me they are out of several items I wanted. Why didn't you tell me that when you walked over?  It took 15 minutes to get the food and she never came back to check on us. I understand it's busy, but  it's all about customer service. I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was HORRIBLE. Our sever took forever to come we almost walked out. He kept apologizing, but not doing anything different. We had to keep coming reminding him what we wanted and it took him 45 minutes to bring me a to go container."}
{"text":"Worse experience I've ever had at a Bob Evans, EVER!
Went there with my elderly uncle who ordered the Senior's size Pot Roast and I tried ordering the regular size Pot Roast Dinner. Their menu says you can substitute any side for the standard side which comes with the meal, so I asked to have the Mac and Cheese instead of the Mashed Potatoes. I was told that wasn't allowed, that the manager doesn't allow it unless you get the Mac and Cheese under the Pot Roast and gravy, just as the Mashed Potatoes would have come. 
I told them to please ask the manager to put the Mac and Cheese on the side or just forget about me eating anything; that's how silly I found this request. What about customer service and customer satisfaction? Does it seem to any of you reading this that this Bob Evans cares more about their silly rules than they do their customers satisfaction? I've never heard of anything so silly in my life.
The manager told the waitress that she would allow it this one time (sounded a lot like my first grade elementary teacher).
Well when they brought out our dinners, my uncle, who ordered the senior size Pot Roast had more on his plate than I did. Without any exaggeration, I had what looked like all of 4 or 5 forks of Pot Roast, and hey are charging $10.29 for the dinner. What a rip off, which I told the waitress is how I felt about it and that they could either give me more of a real portion or simply take it off my bill and not serve me anything.
The result, was that I never got to eat anything at this Bob Evans, and the manager never even had the decency to come out and speak with me.
I use to be a big fan of Bob Evans, but this is about the third problem I've had at the same number of Bob Evans around Cleveland, so I think they're starting to become too much or a corporate style restaurant watching every single serving size and losing complete interest in their customers satisfaction."}
{"text":"Stopped in Christmas Eve morning, greeted and served by Gina who was incredibly cheerful and upbeat! The food was great and the service was exceptional! Definitely coming back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"I mean, I was really hungover, so it did it's job.  But it was one of the greasiest things I've ever eaten in my life.  Took about 15-20 minutes to get a table, but the service was good.  Just don't order the country fried steak unless you want a heart attack at 11:00 am."}
{"text":"Holy Toledo Large Menu.  While Deny's and Eat N' Park have shrunk their menus in a cost cutting effort to raise their profit margins, Bob Evans still maintains one of the largest menus I have seen in a really long time.  Thankfully out waitress was very patient since it took me close to 10 minutes before I was able to pick something to eat.

During this visit we ordered:  Stuffed Garlic Mushrooms, Sausage & Gravy Biscuit Bowl, Chicken Chipotle Sandwhich.  All of it was good in both taste and quality.  The food was served on time and still hot from being cooked.  Perhaps my only complaint in this department would be the size of the sides wasn't as large as in the pictures, but even that is a small hang-up.

I'll have to agree with DW, the onion petals did leave something to be desired.  But the fried mushrooms more than made up for it in the guilty fried food department.  I do definitely want to come back.  There's plenty of other plates to try and I don't get to go to Bob Evan's all that often, so something new every time seems like an awesome prospect."}
{"text":"Best wait staff for breakfast I've ever had. Food is decent and I have found a favorite! I just love Vicky so much, but even when she's not there, everyone is so lovely!! And Sharon at the front!!? So sweet!"}
{"text":"Seemed like staff really did not want to be here today.  Very awkward experience.  Sent food back but at check out no one seemed to care yet asked to complete a survey on the credit card machine.   Food quality and service were very poor today but other reviews show this may not be the case consistently and just a one off.   I'll not return though.  Certainly other options in the area to try next time."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for food that had to be sent back. Potato was raw in the center.   Steak was charred.  

Noticed the other table had to send something back as well.  There was hardly anyone in the place so the experience couldn't be linked to volume.

Server did the best he could with what he had to work with.

This is our second trip back after a bad first one.  I am distressed at my learning curve."}
{"text":"Let's be honest.  I'm not a Bob Evans fan.  
I've been to more Bob Evans in the past 6 months probably than in the past 10 years of my life due to the fact das Mann works for them now.

This location is conveniently located off the highway.  If you are a fan of breakfast food you have multiple options besides this one.  There's the ever-fancy Cracker Barrel and oh yes, an Eat'n Park across the street.

I wasn't greeted upon entrance, which is par for the course with BE these days.  Typically the hostess is no longer found at the hostess desk, but running around he restaurant in the role of a busser....because BE doesn't think they need bussers any longer.  BE.....LISTEN UP!  You need a busser AND a hostess. 

I seated myself at the counter because I didn't intend to be there long, and figured I'd have a cup of coffee while I waited.  Not one employee who walked by me ( and they all walked by me because I was sitting at the counter) greeted me or asked if I needed anything or offered me water.  NADA.  Finally, after approximately 10-15 minutes of sitting there a girl looked at me and said, \"You ready to order now?\"  Um.... is that how you speak to a guest?  If I had been planning on placing an order it would have been a little too late, AND, I probably would have changed my mind with the way you asked me.   BE, your \"servers\" could use some social skill tutoring.

I did use the ladies room while I waited.  Not filthy, but not clean by anyone's standards.  

For the qty. of people BE has standing around shooting the Sh.... You'd think that restaurant would be spotless, and that I'd have people fawning over me.  Think again kids.  If you're looking for decent service, go elsewhere.

If what you want is an over-priced breakfast, feel free to stop on by BE.  It certainly isn't \"Down on the Farm\" anymore...."}
{"text":"We ended up Down On The Farm.. since there was a shorter wait than our 1st 2 stops.  When they finally seated us we got sat at a 7-top in an empty section! What the... Anyway, Food tasted like a gourmet eatery but at hometown prices! Portions were generous too. 
Got the 3 Course Meal: grilled chicken, big salad, 2 sides, dessert + unlimited breads. For under $10! Git r done!!
Everyone happy w/ theirs.  Service was great. 
Tip - try the hot cocoa bread.. \"It's what's for Dinner\""}
{"text":"Every time I come to Ohio I have to eat at Bob Evans excellent service awesome food can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Visiting family and we make it a point to have breakfast at Bob's. Grew up in the area and now live in Boston area. Love the breakfast sausage so we pack some frozen for the drive home. 

Breakfast is reliable here. Coffee good, servers usually attentive and food good. Have not had anything but breakfast here though. Nice setting, friendly and reasonable price."}
{"text":"My Favorite Bob Evans had a SPECIAL MENU for Thanksgiving. No salad, hardly any Turkey, corn was HORRIBLY over cooked. Rolls were good, wanted more but waitress was off taking pictures of other customers while they were yelling her name to pick up her orders. Lunch had just started but service was NOT up to BE normal. Asked for more coffee twice and Thankfully a young man who was delivering food to another table got us coffee and extra creamers. Disappointed..."}
{"text":"I've had better experiences at other Bob Evans locations. The service is usually decent although the most recent time we ate here our waitress was rude. However the food is very mediocre and carelessly made. The chocolate chip pancakes we ordered had barely any chocolate chips in them and one time we had grilled chicken and it was cold. Service is also slow even when the restaurant is fairly empty. I only eat here when I have no other dining options."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local Bob Evans. I love the broasted chicken and the mashed potatoes with country gravy. The Pumpkin Supreme Pie is a seasonal favorite of mine and I really enjoy the double chocolate chip pancakes due to the chocolate chips being Ghirardelli. The staff are always really friendly and the service is efficient."}
{"text":"I've never been so insulted in my life. You had no cows or chickens to say hi to so I did the next logical thing anyone would do which is demand a hay ride around the salad bar, but apparently you don't have those either. What kind of \"down on the farm\" experience is this??? Disappointed."}
{"text":"Bob Evans doesn't seem to get a lot of love in the land of Eat N Park. However, this location has become by go-to choice when it comes down to picking between the two. I've had nothing but great service and food here every time I have visited.

Let me start by saying that I think their chicken noodle soup is every bit as good as Eat N Park's. It has the same big noodles and a nice broth that isn't too salty with nice pieces of chicken and veggies floatin' around in there like some tasty food boats takin' it easy with the noddles. You must have this soup. Take some home if you like.

The hamburger I had here was tasty. It's one of those burgers where you can still taste the beef as well as the condiments on top. To me, this is always a sign of a good burger. Plus, and this is a big plus, the bacon that as on my burger was actually crisp, not that lame limp style. Over at Eat N Park, I usually get a Superburger which is still ginchy, don't get me wrong, but to my tastebuds their other burger offerings don't compare. And their fries certainly don't, either. Bob Evans may be using a frozen brand, but again the taste is the proof in the pudding, as it were.

From the breakfast menu, I have enjoyed the biscuits and gravy with a side of sausage as well as strawberry crepes. If you're familiar with anything from Bob Evans, it may as well be the biscuits and gravy, as they sell their frozen product of it like hotcakes in the local supermarkets. The gravy is tasty, again not too salty and thick enough the either pour over or dunk your biscuits into without too much runoff. Sort of like the consistency of the gravy over at Cracker Barrel.

The crepes are something to behold. As stated, I got the strawberry version, but they also serve them with a blueberry sauce. They're nice and light with a cream cheese filling that's the perfect amount. Again, nothing gets overwhelming in the flavor department here. The strawberry sauce and whipped cream are absolutely fantastico. As for the sides of sausage I have enjoyed here, I usually go with the patty version. The slices are nice and big and thick, to boot. Not too salty, just right.

I've also had the Wildfire Chicken Salad here. It sounds like it would be something spice, but it's basically a fried chicken breast that's been spun in some sweet bbq sauce with some tasty tortilla strips and the usual assortment of veggies and cheeses on top. It's darned tasty as well.

As for the service, the manager on duty is always stopping by tables to see how the guests are enjoying their food and the waitresses are always on point. Never had an issue with either. This location is practically spotless and the bathrooms have always been nice and clean when I've used them.

Honestly, I'm not sure when this place is ever crowded. I usually go at dinner time, and there's always plenty of parking and seating at that time. Perhaps in the morning it's busier. Whatever the case, this Bob Evans is great all around based on my experience and I would highly suggest it to anyone who's in town and is looking for something other than Eat N Park across the street, and definitely for those who might not even be able to get in over there at times when it's overly crowded, which isn't a rarity."}
{"text":"306 needs help took 10 mins to get coffee in a place with less then 8 tables sat mid morning. Then it took ten more mins to place our order and the kicker we sat and watched food sit in the window for a good 8 mins or longer only to see it picked up and brought to our table. Not sure whats happening to this franchise but seems more and more is pre made nasty food, the place that in the day had the best sausage gravy for years now has it shipped in a pouch and it shows in the quality.  Sad corporate America keeps thinking flash frozen and bagged foods is worth serving customers."}
{"text":"Sad such a dynasty has lowered it self to pre-made foods ! I remember in the 80's when they made the stuff in house now the sausage gravy is nothing more then a bag you add water and heat. But at least they still  crack their eggs.  What is with factory made production food over made in house , wake up corporate chains the quality is really way off base. Wont be back hear anytime soon...."}
{"text":"If there was an option for less than one star, I'd go with that. This Bob Evans is dirty and slow. I ordered a salad without the chicken. Watched them pick the chicken off when they realized they goofed. When the server brought the salad out I asked about it, she said they made a new salad. After I found chicken still in the salad, I sent it back. 

It's unfortunate that this area is so limited with restaurant options. But this is definitely the last time we waste our time here."}
{"text":"Went around 6:30 pm last night. (Sunday) I was surprised to find only a few cars in the parking lot. Came in with my boyfriend and our 2 kids. There was only two other tables, so I figured since there was four waitresses/ waiters that we would get good service and our food fast...Boy was I wrong! After being seated two more tables were seated around us. After looking through the menu I looked up and noticed that the other two tables had drinks and one was ordering. Asked the waiter who was our waitress. He replied it was one of the other waitresses but he would try to serve us. By the time we got our drinks, before ordering, I noticed the table that came 5 minutes behind us was already eating. We finally got to order. The waiter returned to tell us there was an up charge for our salads. Ok. I'm a waitress myself so I said that was fine and tried to give him some slack because we were not supposed to be his table anyways. 
   Things just got worse. He brought us the bread. Banana bread and biscuits. Banana bread was excellent. Biscuits were hard as a rock. I literally could have thrown it and busted out a window. Received rolls instead after complaining. Our drinks were empty at this point. 
   Later our food arrived. BEFORE the salads we were charged extra for. My child was given pancakes without syrup. My boyfriend and I both ordered. Turkey and dressing. His was 6.99 with one side. Mine was 10.99 with two sides. I was told by the staff that the more expensive plate was double the amount of turkey and dressing. They arrived looking exactly the same. Our drinks were still empty. I asked the waiter to see the manager. 
   A female assistant manager ( whose name I cannot remember) arrived. I explained the whole situation to her. She replied that there was no excuse for the mix up with the wait staff. But insisted my plate had twice as much as his. Umm....I was looking at it and no it did not. So i paid four more dollars to have green beans??? She then asked what else she could do. So I said more drinks and syrup for my kid would be nice. She returned with the items. Never offered to fix the plate or discount it. Never apologized and then went on. 
   She returned later and asked if we wanted to take some biscuits home with us. They were fresh. That's nice and all but my boyfriend ordered biscuits initially. So was that supposed to give me satisfaction for the horrible experience we had there? Not for me. 
   Our waiter was very apologetic and nice. I believe his name was Marcus. It was not his fault. It was failure from the other wait staff and management. By him taking us on instead of who was assigned to us, it made him crazy busy. Which I don't understand because if there's 6 tables total and 4 waitresses and 1 assistant manager it still should have been no problem. Where's there teamwork people? Not present in this restaurant! 
   So in the end we got 3 free biscuits. Which we were supposed to have in the beginning. No discount offered at all. And the best thing about it was the turkey and dressing or maybe the salads gave my boyfriend and I both stomach problems ( that's putting it very mildly!)
We will never be returning to this restaurant! The assistant manager wasn't managing anything. If u see someone falling behind because of someone else's mistake, send someone else to help him or do it yourself! Isn't that essentially what you are paid for????"}
{"text":"Got Carry Out yesterday. Was told it would take 15 minutes, ended up being around 45-50 minutes, even though they were by no means busy. And they forgot my salad. The pork roast was luke warm. But worst of all, the cheesy potato soup had uncooked potatoes in it, raw potatoes. I couldn't believe it. I'll be honest I thought they just reheated batches of the soup, so some credit to at least attempting something which could be described as 'cooking'."}
{"text":"Gravy was like water, no flavor. Dads hashbrowns where mixed with homefries, also burnt and rubbery. Biscuits where old and stale. Wanted eggs over easy, got them hard/well done. Server never checked on us. And i had to send 3 sets of silverware back because there where HUGE pieces of food on them. A blind man could see the food. Manager looks sloppy and lazy. We paid for our full meal. We dont want discounts or nothing. WE JUST WANT DECENT FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"I love Bob Evans and like most Bob Evans, the servers are pleasant, the food is good, and the price is right. I'll admit the bacon tasted a little like plastic, but I can't get enough of those home fries. Super nice server, super slow cashier. Hey, it's PA, so I expected nothing less!"}
{"text":"it took 42 min to get our \"lunch\" had to substitute ingredients for my salad because they didn't have all the ingredients but turned out good minus the long term wait for our food"}
{"text":"The food was alright, my family got breakfast while I got lunch. You can't go wrong with breakfast but I received a greasy chicken sandwich and my lower bun was like a sponge and absorbed all the grease. My family enjoyed their meals but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to begin. Between the filthy table and floor, the inept wait staff, and the sub-par quality breakfast, it was not a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"This chain has become one of my favorite restaurants.  We stopped in to this location for first time several days ago.  We were greeted with friendly smiles and genuine charming hospitality.  Leslie,  our waitress,  made us feel right at home.  The food was prepared fresh,  hot,  cooked to order.  The rolls were hot and yummy!  Wow,  I'm not much of a bread eater but these were fabulous.  As a woman who appreciates good home-cooked meals, respects the foods from our gardens/farms this is as close as it gets. The kitchen/chefs at this location did a superb job on the \"pot roast\" meal. For the one who did a bad review, well I just don't get it. One thing, you never go into a restaurant near closing and expect superb anything.  That's just disrespectful.  But the ones with negative reviews leave major facts out! I will now become a regular at this one. My money was well spent here, especially at this location with the chain restaurant.  The best thus far!!!! High five to all affiliated with this one."}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for almost 18 years and have been to this location multiple times.  My wife and I walked in this past Sunday morning (9:45) and there was a small wait.  The host/waiter said there were seats at the bar, so we decided to sit there.  We were never acknowledged despite an abundance of staff and managers in the food prep area.  While we were seated, both my wife and I were surprised by what we witnessed.  One of the managers cleaned the rim of a plated of prepared food with his bare thumb - gross!  No one was wearing gloves in the kitchen, either.  One of the line cooks removed a pancake from a plate with his bare fingers and placed the plate back on the bar for pick-up.  After 20 minutes, we finally got up and walked out.  I have purchased holiday meals, gift cards here and dined at Bob Evans all over the south for many years.  Lesson learned - stay with local restaurants (on Yelp also)."}
{"text":"Eh, it's a chain and it's early in the morning but I'll be sticking to the ones in Avon or North Olmsted. This one is kind of gross. Food was okay so that's a plus but place was dirty and that's a major turn off."}
{"text":"i honestly don't know why this place is packed. Many years ago we loved Bob Evans, but any more all their food is filled with high fructose corn syrup, beet sugar, and preservatives . I miss their fresh foods. Cracker Barrel is much better."}
{"text":"First, this review isn't about this Bob Evans (BE) location I'm posting under, as the service and management there have been quite good. This review is about BE Corporate, as I believe the problem I am reporting is their doing, not the local restaurant's. 

So here's my complaint: BE has 3 new \"hash\" items on their menu. I chose the vegetable version. In the menu, the photo of each version is decked out in a wrought iron skillet with 2 eggs on top. Given the $9 price I expected the portion would at least approach dinner-size.

Wrong. The portion was the size of a small side salad. It came in a saucer-size bowl about 1\" thick, with a bottom diameter that was about 80% of the diameter @ the bowl's top edge. (My thinking here is that BE Corporate offices purchased these bowls as optical illusions. Kind of a dumb decision, as it's insulting to customers.)

I estimate the total serving size to be 1.3 cups or maybe 1.5. In the mix of 4 or 5 types of stir fried veggies--probably 1/16th a cup of each type--are the still-tasty-and-reliable (if salty) BE home fries. But the serving size was about 12 individual potato cubes. 1/4, or at best 1/3, of a regular portion if I had chosen a breakfast menu item. 

The taste of the \"hash\" was fine (it wasn't really hash...it was diced veggies). But the TINY portion ruined the meal for me. 

I suspect these portions are strictly defined by the BE Corporate offices, as this is not the first time I've seen these SKIMPY portions @ BE.  But I think it will be the last. Things like this, and some degradation in the tastiness of the non-breakfast items in recent years, are pushing me away from BE. 

Maybe the new owners will get BE back to its former glory days. 

Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"I loved Bob Evans as a kid growing up. After church every Sunday we would go to Bob Evans and their mashed potatoes and gravy and their dinner rolls, oh gosh and their fried chicken! Their salads or even amazing. Today I came back on the Westside and was kind of disappointed. New building awesome that core great friendly servicebut I set my dinner rolls back once because they were overcooked second ones just as overcooked but not as dry around the edges. Biscuits that my husband got were about the same dry and old. Her daughters breakfast was delicious and will cooked. My salad was okay. Like I said the people made it a lot better and we're talking about. The lady checking out my husband gave my daughter a free cookie and invited her to the frozen night that they were having. All in all it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I don't really know why this place has such bad reviews?! Well we did go during the probably least crowded time possible but still our waitress was so nice and friendly! She kept telling us that although life can seem bad right now, that things will get better and turn around the next day. She was just soooooo sweet and getting out food was so quick! As for the food, amazing! And reasonably priced. My friend and I went the other day and it was only 24 dollars!"}
{"text":"Upon being seated after a 10 minute wait on Sunday at noon, our server, Lori (30 years of service,) immediately came to our table and greeted us to take a beverage order. In three minutes, she was back to deliver the drinks and take the food order.  Time to bring all the food was about 10 minutes, and each entree was hot and almost exactly as ordered. The one error was corrected expeditiously. 

I have read the other reviews and determined that there could be some inconsistency at this location, but on our visit, everything was great. In fact, my only complaint was that the pancakes were a tad doughy. Service was sharp and friendly, prices were fair, and the restaurant was mostly clean and well-maintained. 

I suggest you request Lori as your server to up the chances of a pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"Well, I read the other reviews after we were seated and I was a bit worried that our dining experience would suck. Well, it ddn't.  Our waitress, Jazz, was great.  She was constantly stopping by to check on us and she got our food out to us quickly and it was hot and fresh.  All the items we ordered were cooked correctly and were tasty.  I'll probably never go back to this particular location because I live in Texas and just happened to be driving by in a torrential storm, but my two cents are that the place was fine.  Give it a try...and ask for Jazz."}
{"text":"I love coming here early in the morning and sitting at the breakfast bar. The best Bob Evans I've ever been to. The staff is great and the food is consistent."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, every single time. The waitresses never come back to ask you if you need anything, food orders are always messed up. Half the time there isn't even a host and you have to stand there forever and wait. Not sure who runs this place or what the managers are thinking..."}
{"text":"I have been to this bob evans 3 times now and the third time is clearly not the charm. Lexi was our server or at least she was the person who took our order. It was so terrible if you go ask for anyone other than Lexi for sure.  They need to fire the serving staff and start over !!!"}
{"text":"Average place, average food... Honestly, people don't come here because the food is fabulous, they come here because they are cheap. You get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! We had low expectations when we came here, but the service and the food and the vibe were really good"}
{"text":"Stopped early in morning for breakfast. Only one other person there at the time. You would think I would have had excellent service but it was \"ok\" at best. I ordered the BE Fit Breakfast. Suppose to come with scrambled eggs and tomato slices. I got a small slice of tomato that was partially green and a wilted piece of lettuce. The multi-grain pancakes were overdone on outside and still soggy in middle. Definitely not the best and was disappointed. Maybe need to try it at another time."}
{"text":"The food was not to bad but service was so bad waited 20 min to get waited on the girl had a one track mind and should have not been working in this line of work she brought about half of what we ordered had to keep on asking for every thing to finish off are meal the all you can drink tea is a joke I had to ask 2 times to get my first tea then had to ask 2 more times for a refill and never did get it then I was thinking eat-n-park lot was full and Bob Evens lot was empty I know wear I will be going for now on Not the first time this happened their"}
{"text":"Not a great experience at Bob Evans in Avon. First of all we had to wait 10 minutes for a table to be available. When we sat down there were five tables open. I don't know why we had to wait 10 minutes when there were 5 tables open. Our waiter was very slow and didn't collect our plates. We were cold, then we were warm, the heat didn't work. This place needs more staff and needs to invest on upgrading the inside this Bob Evans. The exterior was clean and modern. Our food was average like the other Bob Evans. We also had a 20% off coupon which made it great."}
{"text":"After avoiding this place for more than a year due to poor service I wanted one of their wildfire chicken salads. Long story short the kitchen vs servers were openly fighting. Twenty minutes to get some biscuits, forty five to get our meals. I complained and they gave me 25 % off but I would rather have my lost hour back. BTW my wife's order was wrong but she ate it... we didn't have another hour to wait for them to fix it. As we checked out we had to pass a large group of people waiting for their take-out orders. They really looked steamed. This one is now permanently off our list."}
{"text":"THEIR BISCUITS AND GRAVY = SUPER DELICIOUS!

So it was U of I move-in weekend last weekend. Stayed overnight at a nearby hotel since it was quite a drive from chicago. Decided to give this place a go and was very pleased with the food and the service.

I ordered their Sunshine and Rise or whatever it's called: 2 eggs, 4 sausage links, home fried potatoes and a side of biscuits and gravy. I really liked it. And thr price was not bad at all. Our waitress was nice and always made sure we were doing well. This is definitely a place to stop by if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Ick icky... Server treated us poorly, the food was honestly cold and stale. I felt awkward and uncomfortable the whole time. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Seated promptly, and drinks ordered right away. Drinks took over 10 minutes to come out, kind of excessive for milk and OJ. It took forever to get our server to take our order, and when she finally did, she took a few other orders before putting ours in. The table next to us was seated with food, before our order was ever put in. The featured breakfast items are the griddles, but they are out of home fries. My veggie lovers omelet had so little veggies, it was ridiculous. They sprinkled it with about 15 shreds of cheese, and put none inside. My glass of OJ was $3, approx. half the price of my meal. So, this place is no different than any other chain restaurant that has lost focus of quality."}
{"text":"Another good meal lost to the cost cutting and poor decisions of a chain.Wife and I used to love the pot roast hash. It has since been changed and butchered! Just another reason to avoid the junk!"}
{"text":"Went here since we was staying next door in hotel.
Greeter was pleasant as was complete staff.
Ordered breakfast and all came out quickly and hot.
Good was a little bland got my taste but filled the void in my stomach.
Restaurant was clean,bakery smelled delicious!!!!
Would come back."}
{"text":"Food is not bad, but service could be much better. Tables are not cleared when plates are done. Wait staff not sure of the items that go with each meal. Definitely kid friendly though."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Once in a blue moon, we will have a decent server, but usually, they manage to drop our food and take another 30 minutes to make it. When we've ordered carry out, we've had rude sour workers take our order and then mess it up. When we've gone back to get what they've messed up, they don't apologize. Until things change, they will continue to lose customers. I certainly won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Oh boy...

I am giving this location (Cedar Center, University Hts.), 2 stars because at least I did not get food poisoning.  I have given it 2 tries since it opened a month or so ago, and if I ever go back, it will be after they cross the 6 month mark, so that the teenager servers they hire have either figured it out, or have moved on to other jobs.

I do not understand why a chain that seems to be successful hires servers that are SO green...I suppose you can make a case that the teens can be \"molded\" in the Bob Evans \"style\" (as opposed to hiring experienced servers who actually know what they are doing), but holy moly, it makes for all kinds of crazy when the servers are so nervous/oblivious.

First visit was for lunch, I ordered chicken noodle soup - I figured something basic, should be good.  looked good, lots of chicken pieces...and then I put the first piece of chicken in my mouth...is it possible for chicken to have gristle?  all I know is that when I tried to chew it, it chewed back at me...BLECH!  I discreetly spit the offending piece of chicken into my napkin (something I am not in the habit of doing).  Sorry if I am grossing anyone out, but it is the truth.

I bravely and carefully looked at the rest of the chicken, and while most of it turned out to be fine, there were a few very dried out pieces, and I was stuck trying to figure out how pieces of meat submerged in a liquid can get that dry.

 Got the attention of one of the MANY management types that were there (seemed like for every server there were 2 corporate types hanging around).    I mentioned to this manager what the problems were with my meal, and he gave the typical \"we are new here, I will mention it to the kitchen\"... Ok, fine.  Good luck with that.

2nd visit was for breakfast 2 weeks after my first visit, our server seemed to be holding it together well enough on a busy shift.  I asked for an extra syrup container for my pancakes, and she brought me a small creamer...neither of us had ordered coffee.  I was almost done with the pancakes so I did not point out her error.

I have worked in a kitchen restaurant and also as a server, And although that was a long time ago, I can appreciate how tough a server job can be, I feel sorry for the Bob Evans servers, who apparently did not get a good enough training before opening."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food, atmosphere, customer service here! We were skeptical eating here because of the low reviews. I am not sure who has eaten here before, but they must have outrageous standards. I witnessed the employees all coming up to a regular that sat behind us, an older gentleman, who was sitting by himself, and saying hi to him and they all knew his name. It was a humbling sight. Our server Brooke was wonderful. We would definitely come back again, and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Well, I must say that this was my first Bob Evans restaurant experience and it was only meh although I buy the hot sausage about once every two weeks because it makes everything taste so much better!!

I went with my BF, his brother, mother and grandpa and we wanted to have a nice departing breakfast style meal before we headed back to DC. W ordered tea and coffee and water for the table. The tea was perfection and she gave me more than enough honey and lemon, which was awesome. They ordered the sunshine skillet, mush, two sausage gravy plates and I had the farmers plate. My scrambled eggs were bland, the potatoes were not seasoned and not roasted at all( like they seemed like they were boiled, then placed on a skillet for 10 seconds) and lastly the sausage was good because it was just as I expected. The pancakes were just ok as the blueberry compote was almost pure sugar although the pancakes were chock full of blueberries which was quite a plus. Everyone else gave their food a meh as well, but I think the true issue was the service. Rihann(sp?) was quite forgetful and left our table in the lurch multiple times, from giving me the wrong pancakes, to not giving his grandpa the right dish, to over pouring gravy and not providing a to go container after 10 minutes of waiting. Tsk, tsk.

All in all, I will keep buying the sausage, but not sure how inclined I will be to ever eat at the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Once again Bob Evans has failed my dinner plans with my wife. As we ordered our ice teas and banana bread the waitress had to check to see if those were available. Surprisingly they were this visit. 
We ordered the potato crusted fish and low and behold, Bob Evans no longer serves tarter sauce. How can Bob Evans have 2 fish entrees and not carry any tarter sauce? Are you kidding me right now management? 
Then to get refills on our teas would of been quicker to run to the supermarket because it was close to closing time and everyone is more concerned with cleaning up the restaurant. 
Maybe instead of the fancy silver sleeves the cookie is put in, Bob Evans can invest in tarter sauce? The management at Bob Evans seriously needs to evaluate their own decisions and the locations decisions because these types of thinking sends customers to other restaurants."}
{"text":"Had a nice breakfast this morning with the family. Alex, our server, was very friendly and patient. She always had a smile on her face. Nick, the manager, was also super accommodating and helpful. Food was excellent! We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"No complaints here!  Good food and good service. What more can you ask for?

I recommend their new Philly cheesesteak pot roast dinner. Very tasty!  

If I had to give a critique it would be how the tables are set up. We were sitting inches away from the people at the table next to us."}
{"text":"I went to Bob Evans several location but this cuyahoga Falls one was the worst bob evans experience ever.Restaurant was dirty. Food came out late.  Bathroom is soooooo grows and stinks  made sick to my stomach and lost appetite.  Don't ever come to this Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Thank you for breakfast it was worth to wait . Biscuits and gravy and eggs and extra lean sausages and a waffle with the Cherry with the whipped cream this is so worth it to wait it makes you full"}
{"text":"This place was next door to our hotel we were staying at this past weekend (La Quinta).  On these US road trips we're usually hitting up at either Bob Evans or Cracker Barrel at least once.

As far as a nice sit down bang for the buck, Bob Evans is a good choice for variety and quality.  Their biscuits are not too fluffy and not too lumpy.  I like their portion sizes for country fried steak and the variety they have is good too.  

I went with the country fried steak and eggs with hash and a biscuit this time.  For 10 bucks that's not bad considering a McD's breakfast is only about half of that in price.  

My brother ordered blueberry waffles and he was happy with his food.  I like the portion size too, it's just right and not too much which when I'm long driving is good.  I can't get too full when driving.  Their country fried steak has the right amount of crunch and is a nice thickness too.  I order my gravy on the side so it won't get too soggy too soon and I like to control how much gravy is on it too.  I don't like it when there's too much.  

Considering there was only one server on our side of the restaurant which was basically almost completely full, she did a good job in taking care of us.  I like the fact that when you order a coffee they bring an entire thermos.  It saves us having to ask for more and it saves the server having to come back for refills too.

Decent breakfast, good value, fast and friendly service is all here and free wifi too."}
{"text":"I had a late breakfast on 1-23-17 at Bob Evans in Westlake.  I ordered two scrambled eggs and a side of bacon.  My friend ordered a coffee and a skillet breakfast.  The total bill was $17 and change.  My order totaled $6.39, a bit overpriced.  The eggs were a bit dry but bacon was perfect.  Service was good and the cashier was friendly.  Women's bathroom needed attention (soap dispenser had visible debris on it and one of the toilets was running and running.  This running toilet has been going on for more than a week or two.)  I mentioned the condition of the bathroom to an employee today.  I hope the bathroom gets more regular and better attention as a trip in there before eating may well put one off one's feed.  The coffee tasted better than usual and my friend was offered one to go....a nice touch."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here with a few people. Some insist on ordering breakfast others change it up. I do love there Rise n Shine. The chicken and noodles are very good for a chain restaurant. on Tuesdays children eat free with the purchase of an adult meal. Its nice to save a few bucks every once in awhile. I don't recall ever having a bad meal here, if there was a problem it was fixed. They were backed up in the kitchen once, getting the food took some time.  They offered us free dessert - took some pie home that night. We will go back I find the staff friendly, Tip if your by yourself and going for Breakfast on a Sunday morning, sit at the counter and watch. You will get a good show, I find it reminds me of how hard it can be to work in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Really great omelette custom made with hot coffee that kept flowing til I said stop. Just real good. Recommended. Esp for bkfst."}
{"text":"The staff here is friendly. However, I think Bob Evans in general isn't the same as it used to be. The food portions seem to be smaller and more expensive every time I go. I'd rather go to a small breakfast place with great quality food and good prices. Good to visit once in a while."}
{"text":"We go to this specific Bob Evans fairly frequently, but today the food and service were atrocious. We got there very early- right at 5:00 pm on a Thursday. We had to wait to be seated (we were the only people in the waiting area), then we had to wait a long time before the waitress even came over to take our drink orders. 45 minutes after ordering our food, it finally came. And was terrible and over cooked. The waitress forgot our pancakes, so we had to wait even longer for those. When they finally came, they were burnt and actually made a cracking sound when we cut into them. Not fluffy and delicious. After another long wait, we finally got our check. Which was wrong of course. There is a sign on the table that says kids eat free weekdays in August with the purchase of an adult entree. However we were billed for our children's meals. Then the server told us that sign was wrong and refused to remove the kids meals. At this point we gave up and just paid the bill. But before we left we used the restroom, which was of course disgusting. Feces all over the toilet. We brought this to the managers attention. Who then sent one of the male servers in to clean it. We watched as he cleaned the filthy restroom without bothering to take off his apron. Them he continued to deliver food to tables!!!! Yikes! This place not only has bad service but is also not hygienic and should not be preparing food for customers. We won't be going here again."}
{"text":"The irony is I was dining here only because I had certificates as a result of poor service a couple of weeks earlier at the Gahanna Bob Evans. I waited 10 minutes for someone to take my order then another 10 minutes to receive my beverage. It took 30 minutes from the time I ordered to be served dinner. For the first 45 minutes I was there, the table behind me wasn't bussed.

Though the restaurant did not appear particularly crowded, it did seem each server was responsible for at least 8 tables. I don't know what the staffing level should be but this was clearly not working. I overheard other patrons complaining about the wait time and their server replied they were understaffed; that this is a common occurrence. Other reviews speak similarly of the service so you may want to consider alternatives."}
{"text":"Awful from the start!
Waitress informed us there were 0 clean silverware. It would be 15 minutes before we got anything to use for our breakfast. Asked multiple times for coffee. Waitress said she forgot? Usually decent breakfast but not today! Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Yummy food time pretty typical and safe so not much they can mess up one hopes. Wish they made their gravy and not from a can"}
{"text":"After experiencing the complete dumpster fire that is the Big Mac \"Museum\" the natives were restless and hungry.  I suggested the Eat' n Park seeing as I had no idea what the hell an Eat' n Park was so it would be a new sensation but my idea was vetoed in lieu of the culinary delight that is Bob Evans.

The scene upon entering  was rather depressing.  No one at the host stand, maybe six or seven occupied tables with probably as many staff members standing around doing nothing as there were people actually eating.

Our server while nice, was unbelievably slow because she was watching I think all of the tables except for one while some other server looking types were doing........?  Also to add a little more zest to the equation, our server also apologized to us in advance that things would take a while because the guy doing the cooking was a green horn (first day?).

So we eventually order and as advertised the food took close to 45 minutes to appear which was surprisingly longer than I expected especially since everyone that I could see upon entering was already eating and half of our table ordered some derivative of breakfast.

During our 45 minute wait, drink refills naturally never happened as our server was in combination both taking care of the other five tables plus taking liberal time outs to yak with the hostess plus others all hanging around the drink refill area.

When the food finally comes, it's bad.

Burnt grilled cheese.
Mangy turkey with a giant hole pounded into the mashed potatoes for the gravy that wasn't there.
Dried out and rock hard pancakes.
The French toast was actually alright.

Should it take 45 minutes for the above four items to get made?  I don't think so and if it does, should three out of the four be worthy of getting sent back?  Again, don't think so yet that's the slop that was served.

At this point it was getting late so I was in no mood to fight except for when the check came when I had to go through three people to find someone capable of taking off the kids' meals since it part of a promo they were running.

I guess it was good that the kids' meals were free & the strawberry lemonade was actually awesome but past that the only other positive I can come up with is that I can now remember why the two Bob Evans locations on the other side of PA more local to me closed years ago."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night at 9:20pm, 40 minutes before closing and got turned away because an employee said they were closed, even though the sign on the door and internet said open until 10pm."}
{"text":"Awful service--avoid this place!  We had a party of 7, but called about 9:30 to check how long the wait would be.  Woman told me 5-10 minutes because we'll push some tables together.  We sent half the party over at 9:50 with the balance of the group arriving by 10:00.  When we put our name on the list upon arrival, we were told 10 minutes.  An HOUR later, we were finally seated.  The hostess took us back to the corner of the dining room where I counted no less than 6 empty tables, 3 of which seated at least 5.  I spoke to the Manager, about the need to manage expectations for customer's wait times.  All he offered was an apology and the assurance \"you'll have a great time\".   Didn't even offer so much as a free biscuit or cup of coffee.

This place is not worth the poor service.  The food is no better than any other breakfast place."}
{"text":"The biscuits are as light as air! Soft, buttery, and wonderful.

I've been here 5 times and they've seated me at the same table 3 times.

This a comfortable family place, true Americana."}
{"text":"Came in Sat down ordered food. Pretty average restaurant visit so far, except for the fact that we never got any food.
The people behind us came in AFTER we ordered, we were still waiting for our food when THEIR food was delivered. A group of biker wannabes came in SEVERAL minutes after we ordered, you guessed it they got their food and we were still sitting there staring at empty drink glasses with no food.
Waited about ten more minutes then threw 5 bucks down on the table for two glasses of water and a Coke.
Won't be back Bob Evans, I'm sure you will never miss the loss of my business but I'm sure some other restaurant won't have any problem taking my money."}
{"text":"Our last visit to Bob Evans was only ok .
Service was friendly ,the dinning room area was clean can't say that about the bathroom at all,really really dirty ,the bathroom did not see any cleaning materials in a long time lots of water on the floor too. 
We could not find anything on the menu with pork like pork-roast ,so we had the meat love with mashed potatoes and green beans and that was only ok . 
Love the fresh dinner rolls and the orange juice."}
{"text":"Pretty happy with their breakfast of eggs, hash browns, and biscuits. That classic country breakfast taste is what you can expect. Come in the morning and the ground glass dividers light up with the morning sun shining in. The waitress was very sweet."}
{"text":"Consistently good for breakfast. Very friendly and patient staff (I had a table of 5 young kids). Yes, it was me and 5 kids (Tita (aunt in Tagalog) duty)! Typical breakfast food so nothing to write Yelp to (get it? get it?) hee hee! But, one thing to let you all know is to get those dinner rolls!!! You heard me right. Even though it was breakfast, get the dinner yeast rolls! The best! Had some for the table and ordered some to go! I live in Atlanta now, and we don't have Bob Evans, so I had to order a box of rolls to go!"}
{"text":"Good Bob Evans food you know an love but the service could have been better. I get that it's Sunday and it's there busiest day of the week. But that's no excuse to make us wait 5 minutes on a drink order. Luckily they have an amazing manager who was there to help us out."}
{"text":"So Dennys, I mean Eat n' Park, I mean Bob Evans was okay.  My mentor treated me out to lunch here. So I  can forgive the  bland food in exchange for spending time with someone I care for. 

I got a laugh out of the elderly hostess when she said, \" I'm the only one working today!\" She sounded so down trodden and very unhappy. I was caught of guard by such a negative tone coming from someone who was so tiny and maternal looking.  I wished in that instance that I could have afforded to send her on a much needed vacation. However my salary doesn't permit for such things so instead I just tried to be as little of a fuss as I could while dining. 

I got the fish. Bob Evan's only fish offering was baked cod.  The baked cod was DRY, even after squirting massive amounts of fresh lemon juice on the little filet it just couldn't be resuscitated. My baked cod came with a side of brocoli which was visibly scorched and it didn't go down easy.  My meal was also served with my choice of bread.  I got the pumpkin bread I was feeling seasonal and it was delicious warm and pillowly soft.  

However in the future I'll just eat my Bob' Evans at home in the form of brown sugar sausage links."}
{"text":"I was here on 12/31/12 - Just getting around to approving my Yelp review:

The restaurant was clean, efficient, and the service was friendly.  Oddly though, there were interviews and staff training going on at the table next to us - just seemed unprofessional..."}
{"text":"Great breakfast options here. The candied bacon was very good even though some parts were slightly burned. Laura was an amazing waitress very nice and friendly. 

We ate breakfast of sunshine skillet, chicken and waffles and farmers platter. We all left with extras for a afternoon snack. Don't forget some stickey buns or giant cookies, a must have on the way out."}
{"text":"I stopped for breakfast 8/11/14 at about 11:15 AM at this Bob Evans.   I waited in the lobby for seating.  The cashier said it would be a minute, as she was at the cash register for a paying customer.  A couple of minutes later, another customer came up to pay.  Thinking I was going to be standing there, waiting to be seated I started to walk back to seat myself.  No other employee in the greeting area to seat me.  They seemed only wanting to get their money first before me.  I started to walk back without a hostess, and the cashier gestured that it was OK for me to seat myself.  Brittany, my server greeted me in seconds.  She was very friendly and proficient in immediate greeting and menu knowledge.  

I ordered 3 eggs over medium, country fries and sausage links with rye toast.  I specifically ordered fresh, toasted toast, because on prior occasions at this restaurant, the toast came to my table as just warm bread, no crust, not toasted.  It was the same today.  The sausage was barely warm and I was concerned that it was not cooked properly.    The eggs were done properly, but had a brownish color as if they were fried in the cooking fat of a meat.

A person, a woman came to my table and wanted to know how Bob Evans could make things right.  She said she was the manager.  It seems that they really want to be of service, but I wont be back, at least not for breakfast.

Cashing out, the same cashier was present.  As I was paying my bill, I mentioned that Bob Evans Hostesses and cashiers should  seat waiting customers before 
 taking bill after bill from those wishing to pay their bill.  She said it was Bob Evans policy to \"get the money\" before seating people.  If this is an indication promoting customer satisfaction and company policy, they need some work!"}
{"text":"Don't order online! They don't fill the orders and can't find them. Even though they send you an email and text confirming they've received it and a pick-up time. No apology, just excuses..The employees seemed bewildered by the whole process. \"Your problem is you ordered this at the South Euclid location, we are in University Heights.\" Do you you even know where you work!!! You're on the corner of South Euclid and University Heights."}
{"text":"I have never really been a fan of this chain of restaurants but I was taking a class across the street at the hotel and this was within walking distance so my partner and I went. the food was good( just on food though it would have been 3-4 stars)  but I must say the server we had is what really made me change my views on how I thought about this chain...Tanya was amazing! coffee was always full, delivered our food hot and apologized for it running a little long , then after giving our check to us offered a couple cups of coffee to go to help us stay awake for our long class that day. SHE WAS AN AMAZING SERVER! if she is not training your servers she needs to be!...we were at this location on July 29th 2017 in the early morning."}
{"text":"First our 5-10 min wait was more like 20 mins. Then.. HOW do you specialize in breakfast and have crappy bacon??? Seriously... microwaved bacon.. and our server was rude as hell. She forgot my drink and when I mentioned it, instead of apologizing she goes \"yea\" and eventually came back with it.. we were all bone dry before our waters were refilled. She passed food over our heads instead of walking around the table... mediocre service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"It's a reliable chain I can depend on if I can't find something locally owed. I particularly like their breakfasts. 

It's nothing special, but I know I can count on it. Biscuits and home fries are things I enjoy here.

The service is generally good and the food is pretty good. Value is better than most places and I always look at the specials."}
{"text":"Bob Evans' Restaurants have really gone down hill -- just horrible.  Their products in the grocery stores are unhealthy and full of poisonous hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup.  Bob Evans sold his business and the new owners have really made his name look bad.

I recently had the sausage gravy and for some reason it was brown and not the creamy white gravy that it should be and it lacked any sausage bits - unbelievable.

My eggs that were cooked over easy were cooked in some sort of clear oily possibly trans-fatty hydrogenated shortening -- gross. The oil was clear like baby oil -- eewww and had a chemical taste to it.

This used to be a great place to go to. Now I avoid it an cringe when I hear its name.  Cracker Barrel is putting them out of business.  These new owners are not only killing the business but they are ruining the good name of Bob Evans.  Bob Evans used to stand for quality but not anymore.

They need to get back to natural home-cooked on the farm meals."}
{"text":"Mmmm.....biscuits.  Good breakfast options.  But sometimes I feel like it's a little pricey.  I don't hate it, but I can get better deals elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ok this is a little irritating. I have SOME understanding but regardless just irritating.

So I am not real far from home, hour and a half but decided to bring loved ones with me to stay in a hotel which has Bob Evans right next door. I have a client nearby and we have family in Chesterland so stay in the area for the holiday weekend and do stuff.

Enough of that. So we ordered food yesterday. I was working so I don't know what all was ordered and I was not present for everything that was consumed. What I do know is that we were missing a burger.

I went next door this morning to tell them about this (We called yesterday while going to the pool and was placed on an extended hold so we decided why have this interfere with our time; it is not our fault after all and we value time together.

They promptly remade the burger; awesome! No fuss and problem taken care of. 

When I went back the order from yesterday could not be found by the manager. Did the misspell her name? No idea I was not there. Did she give her name or order at the counter? Well I don't know and she is not back to hotel yet so I have not had a chance to speak with her.

The manager states that orders at the counter would have a name although I watched a couple people order while I stood there waiting for her to look again; no name given.

I don't know what happened; mistakes happen. I don't care enough about a 5 dollar burger to have it interfere with my day our our day together.

The rest of the meal that was received I hear was fine.

* The burger that they made as a replacement I can only assume was thrown away; hopefully they let an employee eat the burger that I paid for and did not receive.

Regardless I wont be back to this location. There is a better than decent chance we would have had dinner here if for no other reason than we can practically fall into the place right from the hotel. I bet you can guess already; we wont be back."}

{"text":"I'm not one for chain restaurants but I absolutely love this place for a good soup and sandwich. I've been here twice for lunch and the service is very friendly. It's definitely a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Bob Evan's in Mayfield/Goldengate is our go to spot every Sunday morning. The servers are usually happy with the rare instance. We usually have Peg as our server and every time we come in she makes us feel right at home. I love getting the biscuits and gravy and leaving feeling full without burning a huge hole in my pocket."}
{"text":"I will not return. We went in on a normal Saturday morning before going swimming. It was packed. And I have no idea why. The smells weren't appealing and the staff is not friendly. We walked in and the person who seats the guest walks away. And he never came back. We waited about 10 minutes. Which was far too long. no one even spoke to us.  Times before we have been in and the food was ok. But the service was lacking. 15 minutes waits on a beverage or even to place an order. There is favoritism among servers and regulars. Pity because I do actually tip based on service. This establishment is a waste of space"}
{"text":"We were visiting relatives in Ohio who suggested Bob Evans for breakfast on Sunday. We've been pleased with locations in Florida, and hey, the famed Bob Evans farms are in Ohio ... so why not?

We lucked into a nearly-zero wait for our party of five (or perhaps four-and-a-half, depending on how you count a first-grader), arriving around 10:30, though service seemed to run a bit slower than I'd have expected for a place that really wants to turn the tables on a Sunday morning. I'm crediting that to their having rolled out two different blends of coffee (\"signature\" and \"dark roast\") in addition to decaf; it took quite a while for a \"new pot\" of whatever we were getting to be brewed and served after seating. Long enough, in fact, we were anticipating receiving coffee and entrees at the same time (though in fairness, the coffee arrived first, by a nose).

But overall, service was pleasant, and breakfast was what we expected it to be. As a relatively new chain location, it's more spacious than other, more \"local flavor\" kinds of breakfast joints. While I might not go out of my way to hit this place up, it does serve its purpose if one is in the area and in a breakfast-y kind of way."}
{"text":"Another terrible experience. Staff is rude and take forever. Unfortunate that there's been no improvement."}
{"text":"We have visited this Bob Evans location for breakfast several times over the past month or so.  I am mystified by the ratings here on YELP.  Our experiences have been nothing but favorable (although we have only dined here for breakfasts).

I left home with a craving for breakfast on a weekday morning one day last month.  I drove by the restaurant near our home because, although it opens at 7:00 AM, it was still closed - it was 10 after seven...

I decided to eat at Bob Evans and I'm glad I did!  The restaurant was bright, clean and buzzing with activity!  The hostess looked to be college aged - as did many of the staff.  Everyone I encountered was happy and awake.  As a (dreadful) \"morning person\" I appreciate this.

My waitress was amazing!  She gave me time to relax with my coffee and read my book until I had time to look at the menu.  By the way, the ice water at this restaurant is delicious!!  The ice is fresh and doesn't taint the flavor of the water.

Several patrons at adjacent tables were entertaining clients at early morning meetings or heading out to construction projects.  The waitstaff easily adjusted to all manner of diners.

I ordered coffee with milk, ice water, an omelette, hash browns and a buttermilk biscuit.  I \"created my own omelette\" with diced ham, jack cheese, onions, tomatoes and jalapenos.  I enjoyed my meal!  The omelette was beautiful - gooey cheese, fluffy eggs, saute'ed onions - hot and steamy throughout!  The jalapenoes were FAR too hot for me however (I diced them up in tiny bits and reintroduced them to my omelette in order to enjoy every ounce of them).  My buttermilk biscuits were served warm but the butter hadn't adequately melted on the tops.  I prefer my butter to be melted into the bread rather than have \"softened butter\" spread over a warm biscuit.  My husband prefers his toast/biscuits the same way.  My hash browns were slightly cool but I enjoyed those last (I eat one thing at a time).

My husband and I ate here again on Sunday morning.  Great service, delicious food and happy employees!  Oh, and the price is right for breakfast.  

Other area diners tend to be hit-or-miss with waitstaff who are cantankerous at 7:00 in the morning... I don't need the attitude when I'm on my way to work.

I'm happy that we finally discovered \"breakfast at Bob Evans\"."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave this place negative stars. I love bob Evans but this place was awful. We waited 10 minutes to get seated. After being seated and another ten minutes without being recognized by our waitress we got up and left. Terrible place"}
{"text":"I love to come here for breakfast.  The food is delicious and it's conveniently located.  I have eaten at this location multiple times when I was living here in Charlotte.  Now, I only go there when visiting and the experience is still the same.  Good food and good service here always."}
{"text":"Poorly run - lots of tables needing cleaning  while servers walk right by 

Typical chain menu - good selection but dependant on chefs and servers to prepare and serve well and promptly (they didn't on our visit) 

Looked like a few good servers, but we didn't get ome.   For a breakfast place, someone (the manager) should be walking around with 2 pots, checking up on things.  Our coffee was never refilled. 

There's better places to spend your money"}
{"text":"15  min. Wait. Cold breakfast NOT served at the same time. Slow bus boys.
We will be going back to George's. Church patrons feel they can park anywhere evidently because they have kids who can walk.
Old fryer grease left a bad taste in my brides mouth.
Sausage gravy portions were a joke.
And to think I signed up for what? Three pancakes.
Diana's, George's or anywhere else is my suggestion."}
{"text":"Great food awful service okay price awful service nice clean place awful service took forever not to sit or to order just everything else. It's a shame. Looks like they could use some younger fast or better trained staff"}
{"text":"Turkey awful, soup worse, Service is atrocious. Manager very little help. Hey the entire meal with no drinks. Sent the turkey back to dry and hard.  Second batch was cold. Very sad seems to be a nice location well lit clean environment. Poorly trained staff and management how to handle situations. Much improvement is needed here!!! Back many weeks later. No change. Younger staff but poorly trained. Never got cup of ice or banana bread. Ugh. Why do I eat here. Half !"}
{"text":"Tried it a couple times and every time seems to be worse than the time before. Waiting forever, sitting next to dirty tables the entire visit, severs don't want to be there, manager never stops by tables. Just save yourself the money and go to get go next door."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. Friendly staff, good service and always great food. Our favorite is the homestead breakfast with sausage gravy and biscuits. The pot roast sandwich is delicious as is there chicken noodle soup. Surprise!...eggs come the way you order them. Before I retired, my staff and I ordered lunch and dinner take-out often and the orders were pretty much always right."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here for a late lunch yesterday. Was greeted right away and was seated at a table. Our waitress showed up right away and took our drink orders and then we noticed how dirty our table was. Bry had his arm on the edge of the table and when he picked it up there was stuff all over the sleeve of his hoodie. Really gross. He said something to our waitress when she brought our drink order. She apologized and went and got a wet rag and wiped down Bryan's side of the table just on the edge where he got the stuff on his hoodie. Once she left Bry used his napkin to go over the table and when he picked it up it was brown so gross. At this point the manager walked over to our table and apologized.  Bry shows her the napkin and she apologized again went and got a rag and wiped down our entire table. She also said our bill would be on the house. she apologized again and left us to decide what we wanted to eat. At this point we went over the menu. There are lots of comfort food dishes here which was right up my ally for the day (I haven't been feeling all that great). I went with the chicken soup with a few rolls, Bry got a turkey dinner and the little boy went with a cheese burger. I would have taken pictures of everything but the storage on my phone is full so I have to purge some stuff in the next few days. Bryan said the turkey hit the spot and the little man loved the smiley face fries he got with his burger. My soup was also good. There were nice big chunks of chicken and it was a very thick soup for chicken noodle. Not a whole lot of broth very hearty. Our waitress didn't offer dessert and was a little standoffish after the whole dirty table ordeal. When it was time to go neither Bryan or I had cash on us so we ended up buying a loaf of cherry bread so we could leave our waitress a tip. It was a much more eventful meal then we were hoping for. I appreciate the manager covering the bill but it also makes me feel a little uncomfortable adding additional stuff like a cookie for the boy which we would have gotten if our waitress didn't make it sound like she was trying to shoo us out the door. Anyways will prob give this place one more try and see how it goes. Also after the whole dirty table thing the hostess was wiping down tables before people were sat. So at lest they tried to correct there mistakes. Hopefully next time won't be as eventful."}
{"text":"Well I guess if you go to the state a restaurant is from, you should expect it to be terrible? I sat at the bar and ordered 1 egg with bacon and gravy/biscuits. Well 20 minutes goes by and i see my egg be placed on the counter......10 min later my bacon is up there. 5 min later she puts it on the same plate and brings it to me. I said i cant eat food thats been sitting there that long. The manager tried to make it better but if that is what they are willing to serve, no thanks."}
{"text":"Extremely busy. Young girls working the hostess stand need to learn how to multitask and be more polite. Everyone just standing around behind the counter need to help everyone else while they aren't busy. There is a wait, but no one is cleaning the open tables. This is sad to watch.


Update: I am just watching the \"manager\" stand around and chat. He hasn't done anything in over 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Tends to get packed around brunch time on the weekends so make sure to arrive early to avoid a somewhat long of a wait. This is of course, a dreaded chain restaurant but since this is really for breakfast and lunch, the food itself was not bad at all.

I went for the pancakes and sausage which were flaky and fluffy with a good amount of flavor. The sausage was cooked to my liking and were nicely prepared. Overall, it was a pretty plate to look at it and consume. The service for most of the time, was very good with a kind wait staff and front manager.

Hard to say this, but I actually miss this joint after leaving my hometown. I realize alot of people will be turned off just because it's a chain, but in reality, this isn't that terrible at all."}
{"text":"Never a standout but has only gotten worse.

Pulled into the parking lot at 11:30 and the parking lot was only half full. Normally packed at that time of day. Also when we went it, while there was confusion as to who was going to seat us, we were seated almost immediately. Normally at this time of day on a weekend, you would be looking at 20 - 30 minute wait.

What happened?

Don't know for sure but it may be related to the fact that the Bob Evans Restaurants were sold off to the same company that own's Red Lobster and California Pizza back in January. Gone is the little store that used to be in the entrance that sold a whole lot of homey things.

We both were in the mood for comfort things so my wife went in the direction of the Turkey with Dressing while I went for the Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes and gravy and I substituted Hash browns for the normal carrots.

Both came out sub par. The Turkey was fine but the dressing and did not have any gravy on it for moisture. She asked for additional gravy and they brought here a bowl and when she added it to the dressing, it was still too dry.

I like Meat Loaf and after the Loaf had been cooked, it was grilled. Generally not bad but this time it was so overcooked that it was hard and dry.  The Hash Browns were very under cooked and the highlight of my lunch was the masked potatoes and gravy.

Before we left, my wife went to the ladies restroom and came back disgusted because as she described it, it had been trashed and was filthy. I'll have to take her work on this one.

Service was fair but not great.

First Bob Evans I ever went to was back in 1986 on Arlington Rd in Akron.  What impressed me then was the great service, basic comfort food prepared well and immaculately clean restaurants.

Can't say the same about this location."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I was here and had hopes it would get better.  Service was always their week point and I'm sorry to say, it has not gotten any better.

Granted it appears they have done some remodeling in the front which does give a nice open clean atmosphere on entering, it stops there.

We stopped for lunch today after shopping at Northlake Mall.  The host was not sure of his seating chart and had to physically go and confirm so there was more than a fair measure of confusion here.  He seated us in a booth but apparently no one told our server who did not appear for over 5 minutes going on 10.

She was not very friendly but everyone has an off day.  My wife ordered iced tea and I ordered coffee.  Can't comment on her tea and while Bob Evans Coffee is normally very good and they sell it at the counter, my coffee was extreamely weak and had nothing bold about it.

My wife ordered a bowl of their potato soup and a large salad while I had the open faced turkey with dressing, mashed potatoes, cranberries and gravy.  I expected a open faced turkey sandwich with dressing, mashed potatoes on the side along with the cranberries.  Everything except the cranberries were piled on top of each other and as far as the cranberries, never did see them anywhere.

I had my tablet while I was there so I could check the news but should have gone back to the car to get my hotspot.  While their WiFi which the advertize at the door, showed a strong signal, it kept dropping several times a minute.  Finally gave up and went back to the smartphone.

All in all, would not recommend to anyone.  Poor service, indiferrent and uninvolved management and less than stellar cusine does not make for a sucessful restaurant."}
{"text":"The one thing that has been pretty consistent about this place has been the bad service. And I have been at this location many times since they open. It is 8:15 on a Sunday night and they close at 9. The service was somewhat faster than usual because there are barely any people here. I understand they are getting ready to close but if you advertise being open until then you should have enough of everything to las until then. I ordered the bold coffee. It was cold and when I ask for a refill I was told they are not making anymore. The server did give me a drink of my choice at no charge. I do agree with the one reviewer here that said that there seem to be too many young people working here, and tonight I don't think there was a manager on site. I got to hear all of their personal conversations while dining as they where being pretty loud. Very unprofessional if you ask me. I keep coming to this location because is literally around the corner from my house,hoping that things have changed, so I dont have to travel 15 minutes up to the road to the Mayfield Heights location. Unfortunately is business as usual here."}
{"text":"Slowest ever. Nice waitress, but I think it was the kitchen. But took 15 min to get a table, even though many open. Really odd. If you're in a hurry, go elsewhere. Food didn't look like the picture in menu. Kitchen team prob needs an overhaul."}
{"text":"We are having doubts about the Bob Evans in West Mifflin.  Although the food is always good and tasty, everything is always cold.  This is not the first time this has happened. Every time we go there, for breakfast, lunch or dinner the meals have to be sent back.  We went there on 6/9/14 and all three meals were brought to the table cold.  When the manager asked how everything was, we mentioned this and it was ignored.  Finally after numerous attempts to warm the food in the microwave it was hot enough for dinner, although maybe Bob Evans should consider taking the lettuce and cranberry sauce off the plate before putting in the microwave."}
{"text":"Had the best Mother's Day breakfast. Idk why all the bad reviews. Our food was phenomenal. Fluffy pancakes, delicious turkey sausage, and eggs were cooked perfectly. The oatmeal was delicious. Our waitress was one of the best I've ever had. Her name was Melissa, she was so attentive and accommodating and sooooo sweet. Made our meal way better having s friendly face serve you. Try this place again if you had a bad experience, we are fans!"}
{"text":"I used to like Bob Evans, but I think it depends on which one you visit.  The one in Cleveland Hts on Cedar is really tasty but this one was...meh, at best.

My food was not hot, the eggs were not cooked to my specification, the pancakes reminded me of cardboard with syrup and the service was butt awful.  They switched on us twice and neither wanted womanto get anything except when it came to the daggone bill.

I usually call the manager when I am so disappointed, but this time, no tip was a better message.

Peace!"}
{"text":"Well ....after traveling 11 hours from NH to visit our family and not having been home in 2 years this restaurant was on the MUST do on the list before heading back. WHAT A MISTAKE! We first waited 35 minutes to be sat and during this time had to watch about 5 people including the manager figure out how to make a table to fit 9 people (clearly a struggle). Once they arranged two tables to accomodate our party the manager announced that 2 women would be taking care of our table for service which never happened and the one server we did have was absolutely over whelmed even announcing that to us .  Our food took another 45 minutes and during this time the waitress never came back to see about refilling coffee urns or waters and was MIA. When she did arrive with the first tray of food she managed to spill hot syrup onto my 82 year old grandfather who than had to undress down to his under shirt in the middle of  the restaurant. She did apologize and brought over a warm towel for him to wipe himself off. It took about another 4 trips to and from the kitchen window to get the remainder of our food instead of our waitress asking for some help were all getting served at different times with different parts of our meals. After all the irritation and frustration we were ready to leave after 2 and a half hours and were given our checks. We went to the check out counter only having to ask about speaking with the manager who had no clue what was happening and while apologizing tried to blame the poor service on the fact that the two tables that were put together for us were in 2 seperate sections for their servers (DON'T GIVE ME A LAME ASS EXCUSE GUY). Being someone in the food service business I would have offered to pay for the dry cleaning for the spilt syrup or a discount off the bill to make it right. It is going to be extremely difficult to convince me to go back to a childhood favorite restaurant the next time in town and if they happen to sell sausage gravy at the Giant Eagle grocery store id rather get it there. Good luck to anyone else who wants to head there for a meal!

Such a disappointment"}
{"text":"The perfect stop for sunday brunch, if you get there before 10:30am and.  After that you will wait for a table, the closer to noon, the longer the wait.  We are dealing with a chain, but the food is very good and consistent.  The wait staff is usually very good, even during busy periods.  They will actually allow for subsitutions without throwing a fit or more importantly charging extra for it!  For breakfast, the crepes are really good.  Very little on crepe, very nice cheese filling,and even the blueberry topping tastes like it could be freshly made.  The french toast is another winner, nice mix of cinnamon and sweetness, neither overwhelms the other.  Of course, the regular menu is pretty good.  Best thing maybe chili."}
{"text":"It's a chain, but very good.  The 3 course meal was a nice deal.  They hide the chili off the menu.  The word seasonal is attached to the chili, so it maybe only certain days.  But it's worth it to ask.  It's thick and well seasoned but not five alarm stuff.

The pot roast and country fried steak were spot on.  The pot roast needs nothing but a fork.  The country fried steak was tender and juicy.  The food doesn't taste like warmed up stuff.  The service is very good, not fast food.  They will bring you a mix of rolls and breads just ask."}
{"text":"They have the best french toast around mentor. The pop however is quite disgusting. The Kids menu has a well crafted and explary picture development. The service is quite quaint"}
{"text":"Samantha is the real MVP! We were seated quickly and served in a timely manner. Our waitress did not leave us hanging. Great service and food."}
{"text":"Solid diner. Good breakfast. Very kid friendly. Nice and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Was surprised how much B.E. has gone down hill the last few visits.After waiting 30 minutes for  bisquits/gravey and bacon I asked for Manager.She states we have someone new in kitchen.Waitress mad said I could have gotten that myself it was your bacon that took so long.Really? excuses? How unprofessional.The lady next to us waited so long on oatmeal her Mother finished her breakfast and she never got her oatmeal,They gave her a muffin to make up for it.As we left we saw the GFS truck unloading.So much for \"Down on the Farm\""}
{"text":"They don't play around with portions! Every time I have ordered it's probably been enough food for my husband and I to share. I really like there stuffing that comes with the turkey meal, which is a very large plate of food! Service is great! Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"By far the worst Bob Evans in the area.  A 15 minute wait to be seated easily turns into 45 minutes.  Wait staff tries their best, but the service is slow. Took 1 hr and 20 minutes before our breakfast arrived at the table. Two managers were out on the floor, one looked like he was helping while the other looked lost and confused. Better off going to McDonald's next door.  Will never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"I had wrote a review on this restaurant, and it looks like it has been removed!  
Well, the place is not Bob Evans down on the farm, it is Bob Evans down in the gutter!!!!
Complete rip off, chicken had hard skin on it in the chicken and noodles, and in the pot pie, and green beans had a metallic taste.  Portions were very small.  I could go on an on, just do not go there they have no care about what they serve.  They should be inspected.

{"text":"I feel really bad for having pre-conceived notions about Bob Evans. We decided to grab a quick breakfast before leaving Cleveland and BE was the first restaurant we saw. This location looks quite new - it's modern and chic with a sense of 'homey-ness. 

Some highlights of this place:
- Heaps of parking as it's in a plaza
- Very reasonable for a pretty decent breakfast (under $10 for a huge omelet with hash browns, buttered toast, and bottomless coffee)
- Great (and friendly) service
- Free unlimited WiFi

I don't mind coming back for breakfast.

Good for: quick bite, breakfast, dessert"}
{"text":"The service here wasn't that great, but it was a Saturday night. The only thing I care about except getting my order correct usually is keeping my glass full of water and ice. Thats all. And here when it was brought to me there was like 1 ice cube in it, literally. 

It took a while to get our soup and salad. And the bread that was supposed to come at the time we had our soup, didn't come until we got our food. 

So everything came at once. 

I got the 3 course combo of the Salad, Pot Roast with carrots and mashed potatoes and a Chocolate Chunk Cookie to take with me, it was a good deal at i believe  $10.99.

So the food was good and beat the service we got. 

I wish they had Bob Evans all over, especially here in Texas. We sure miss it and their breakfast is always on point."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Most unorganized breakfast joint in the area. They sat us, a table of 6 quickly on a slow Saturday am. We waited for 15 minutes never to even be waited on. Finally a manager came and got our drinks and food order all at once. 20 minutes go buy. Noting happens. Finally our waitress comes, apologized and said our food would be up in a minute. All the while I'm watching our food under the heat lamp. 15 minutes later she grabs it off the rack and brings it to us. To me, good service is paramount. At Bob Evans Peters, it's not. Never to go back. Eat-n-park is right down the street."}
{"text":"When I was born and the doctor slapped me it was with a side of sausage gravy from Bob Evans! Ever since this place has brought me fond memories from my childhood. Once a year when I come home to Cleveland, Ohio for the holiday's I go to the Bob Evans at the end of our street and get the artery clogging Homestead Breakfast. 2 eggs over easy, hashbrowns. Bob's famous sausage patties, 2 buttermilk biscuits and a side bowl of sausage gravy. On Thanksgiving Day. I'm so full I can hardly breath. and I have to digest this before the Big Thanksgiving Day Dinner. Ugh! Wish me luck!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Brunswick and I received the same service as others that I've been to. I thought it was good. The food as always was great. The waitress was very nice and food was timely."}
{"text":"I understand that people on 4th of July suppose to grill at home or at friends/families house but many of us just don't have a chance and want to go out to eat. Anyway we went there on Monday July 4th. First of all they only served a few tables and because of that everybody had to wait 15 to be seated. I ordered their famous bean soup. It was canned beans with lots of water with some suspicious meat in it! The fish I ordered was mushy and tasteless. The service was slow. The floors in the restaurant part was oily and slippery I almost fell. No toilet tissue in the whole female bathroom whatsoever. So why open if the food is questionable and they have no staff?
I used to like this place but I will not go there anymore because they showed what they are capable to do with food... Besides I was sick to my stomach for 2 days..."}
{"text":"Always good for Breakfast at any time.
Many per selected complete breakfast menu choices as well very many a la carte choices.
When you are in the neighborhood and hungry for breakfast you can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"Traveling around town, not sure where to get some decent breakfast any time of the day? Suggestion: Bob Evans.

Breakfast is our thing at Bob Evans. We have been to several around the Pittsburgh region and they are all very consistent in what you can expect.  What's that: standard clean modern décor, good service and good breakfast for the money. 

They keep quality and price in check by not trying to be something pretentious that they are not. Look for just good old down home breakfast food. They might be slightly edging on an item or two toward the overstuffed waffles and such but I don't go for all that.

I like the standard bearers of eggs over easy, sausage, home fries and pancakes.  The food comes out fast and good. The coffee is decent and refilled when you want it. If I want to go extravagant I get the blueberry pancakes instead of plain. 

The menu contains many predefined breakfast combinations but everything I can think of also can be ordered ala carte. There are many 'low calorie' options, breakfast fruits and juices. But never forget the famous sausage gravy with biscuits. This combo can't be beat when you want to go bad.

Did I say they have breakfast all day? Nice."}
{"text":"Small wait on a Saturday around noon. Menu selection is very large, always rotating specials which is nice. My omelette today was large but I really wish they would use more seasonings on their veggies, they taste kinda \"blah\". Service was slow, but the place was super busy."}
{"text":"Always good food today at noon we didnt gwt greeted from the server for over 6 minutes....i hope this doesn't start a down hill trend...."}
{"text":"Just me and my wife went . The food tasted flat . Service was good and polite. This was the second time we visited.  One time was right when they opened and then about a month ago
. It cost $32 for just two adults.  I really don't understand how seniors afford this place. I have a rule I go by. If I can cook it better at home I will not eat at this place again. It isn't to hard to make gravy. From milk instead of water. Just wasn't what I expected. So I guess I will leave the farm and cook in my kitchen,"}
{"text":"Despite its many shortcomings I eat here every so often out of necessity. Everyone on the way home looking for a quick bite after work is likely thinking the same thing. Bob Evans has unfulfilled potential and is losing this market.

This is a dinner review.

The good: the new \"broasted\" chicken is juicy and delicious. The rest of the stuff on the menu is served hot and fresh. Broccoli sides are fresh not frozen or canned. Mashed potatoes ok. Service is good -- the servers are friendly.

The bad: canned string beans, floor needs vacuuming and looks gross. If the previous occupant made a mess, please clean the floor of the booth for the next customer, not just the table.

The ugly: the bathroom smelled like the previous occupant suffered an \"ailment\" in there. Yup, it must have been a \"condition\".

These are all symptoms of cost cutting I think."}
{"text":"What a pathetic disaster to House so much space on Howe Avenue. BE needs to just do a clean sweep of the staff and replace everyone. I've been here so many times and idk why I even come back here. I do have this psychological issue where I have a hard time giving up on people, so I guess I can add restaurants to that as well? A girl just wants a farmers choice breakfast, not a headache!

Ridiculous wait time (45 minutes) when HALF of the restaurant was empty. Idk if we just came after a rush or something, but it shouldn't take 45 minutes to bus tables. 

Food order is literally never correct. You'll have your eggs prepared incorrectly, it'll be cold, or you'll wait an hour for lukewarm French toast. Managers do not care about server mistakes, and offer absolutely no alternative to help you. 

Don't be like me. Don't subject yourself to this place thinking they've changed. Just go to Franks or Fred's. Avoid like a creepy dude at a bar."}
{"text":"Awful, just awful! The food and the service. Stay away. I ordered the Brostad chicken dinner-white meat. Picture on the menus shows a wing and a breast. I got 2 wings that looked like they came from pigeons! The fries were greasy and the Mac and cheese was, blah. The potato soup was cold and tasteless."}
{"text":"Terrible!! We ate here yesterday evening around 7:30 and it was a big mistake. Pulled into the parking lot and there were barely any cars but once inside we were told there would be a 10 minute wait which was more like 20. Waitress took our order and quickly brought coffee and then dinner rolls but my salad didn't come out for at least another half an hour. When I  inquired about the wait for our meals she informed us that the cook was \"injured \" and the manager was filling in. After about another 10 minutes our food came out and I bit into my potato crusted flounder and immediately spit it back out and discovered that the rest of the fish was literally cold and translucent. Disgusting!! I summoned the waitress and told her about the meal and she apologized and offered to take it off the bill and asked if I would like another meal instead. We could tell that she was embarrassed and it was obviously not her fault, so as to not make an awkward situation worse I decided on just a bowl of soup. I feel it was managements obligation to have the hostess inform the people coming into the restaurant of the situation with the cook and that there would most likely be a wait and possible inconvenience so that they would have the option to dine elsewhere since there are so many other dining establishments in that area. This place literally left a bad taste in my mouth !!!!"}
{"text":"There was a party of 6, we were well accommodated with plenty of space. 

The food wasn't hot. I like my breakfast food to be hot. I ordered french toast, and I definitely had better. I also ordered tea, and the water was luke warm. I did ask for another, and that came out hot. 

The server was not generally responsive to us, and overall the food was sub par. Skid this location."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this location over the weekend for a late breakfast. Although we were seated right away and the server was pleasant enough we still felt unwelcome. We both ordered coffee and only received 1 re-fill for the entire visit. We felt like our server was off in the back more than she was on the floor. Even though we saw more of the other severs on the floor running around, rarely did we actually see anyone refilling coffee cups or beverage glasses- it's like everyone had their own agenda- to avoid the patrons. The funny thing was there was one girl walking up and down aisles studying people and then she would circle back and hand-out surveys \"RANDOMLY\"- was she hand picking people to take these surveys??? We would of liked a survey but was never offered one. So, upon our checkout we knew for sure we would be asked how our our meal/visit was- NOPE, not this time, not at this location. No thank you, no nothing. We have never been in any Bob Evans where they didn't ask for your opinion at the end of the meal or bid you a good day. My husband and I just looked at each other stunned, I guess they really didn't want our opinions. To make matters worse, the team lead was standing right there (at least that's what her name tag said- not much of a lead if you ask me). I think we'll be going to other Bob Evans locations where they appreciate our business. Also, to note- it was freezing in there. Yes, it was a nice day out for December in Ohio but air condition nice, no-way. There were more people wearing their jackets in the restaurant then not. And the food, meh- barely warm. Not worth our time or money! I contacted corporate about this terrible location- we'll see if I get a response back."}
{"text":"Disgusting!  Go to Dennys..or even McDonald's...this place has gone downhill. They are being extra stingy on ingredients and toppings...which can only mean one thing.
Avoid!"}
{"text":"An average dinner for a chain restaurant, but don't expect fresh ingredients or an extremely satisfactory experience. Don't go here if you want to eat late. We arrived at 9:30 and were made to feel guilty because the wait staff wanted to leave by 10:00 sharp. The waitress repeated \"because we close at 10\" in about five different ways and nervously looked towards the clock throughout the night. Many of the staff had loud conversations near our table  about how they \"desperately couldn't wait to get out of here.\"

Come here around regular eating hours and don't expect a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"I had a great breakfast experience here. Got the farmers breakfast (I think it's called?). Really the best bang for your buck. The french toast, potatoes, cheesy eggs and bacon were all great. Not a bad thing served! It was a bit slow with the service because it seemed like only one waitress was working our entire side of the restaurant but she did the best job that she could. This is the only time I've eaten here, but I'll definitely be back for breakfast asap."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite on my way home.  Overall, the food and service were good.  I did notice the bathrooms were not clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Went here this morning, and had an amazing waitress, and the food came out hot, and correct.  We go to this location every other month or so, and usually have a very pleasant experience.  

We usually have at least a party of 7, and have never had an issue with getting a table in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"The food is okay and the service is typically fine. The biggest issue I have is the lack of clean dishes. The surfaces (inside and out) of the glasses and cups always feel like 80 grit sandpaper and I have had to get new silverware on more than one occasion due to what appears to be a \"rinse slightly and go so we don't wast money on water, detergent and energy by properly using and maintaining the dishwasher because we're cheap bastards and couldn't care any less about the people who pay our bills since we feel they are all freaking stupid\" policy.  But then again, they're probably correct about the majority of their patrons. I will no longer be one of those."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast today on the way to the airport. Quick breakfast but had the best customer service and the pancakes and eggs cooked over medium were perfect.  Would definitely stop back for a quick breakfast and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Come here for breakfast and dinner a lot. The food is fantastic and the servers are always friendly and provide awesome service. If you for some reason have not tried Bob Evans yet, I strongly recommend it"}
{"text":"Service- excellent. Very friendly and always checked up on us. 
 
Food- average. Nothing exceptional. Only complaint was my coffee. (But this could also be my fault for using irregular creamers). 

Price- very reasonable!

I would return"}
{"text":"It's Bob Evans. Not much too say, pretty consistent with other Bob Evans. Servers have always been polite food always hot."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast the other day. Can't believe I've never been there. While what I ordered was not bad, it was painfully average. The description of the border scramble (an omelet with jalapenos, sour cream, sausage, and some other stuff sounded amazing, when it came out it just wasn't. There was water all over the plate and the whole thing just look unappetizing. While the tast was ok, I don't think I would ever go back here. There is a reason why I usually pick local places over chains."}
{"text":"I will not be going back to this particular Bob Evans. Upon arrival, I waited in line to put my name in with the hostess - and she completely skipped over me and started taking the names from the couple behind me. I waited until she was done, and then I told her \"I'm here too\" and gave her my name - she apologized. 

After being seated, the waitress asked for our orders, but we had not looked over the menu yet and needed more time. She came back 35 minutes later to finally take the order. Then, when the food arrived, they had gotten my friends' order wrong. The waitress corrected the issue. As we were eating, I noticed fruit flies pestering my friend; I looked around and noticed about 20 bugs plastered all over the wall/artwork hanging over our booth. I let the waitress know and she stated she would inform management. As we were getting ready to leave, my friend asked for a box, but the waitress took too long to get back to us so we ended up leaving. 

There was also no soap in the bathroom - an employee had come in to change it previously, and left the keys in the soap dispenser, but never came back. I overheard several other customers complaining upfront about the issue."}
{"text":"Its always good here. I haven't had a bad experience yet, and I've been coming here for years."}
{"text":"Walked out. 

I stopped in on 7/22 at about 9pm (they are open until 10) for an easy late supper.  Unfortunately  the staff was more concerned with cleaning up than serving customers.  There were only about 6-8 customers there but yet I waited at the hostess stand for a table and then sat for more than 5 min waiting for a server.  I finally walked out.  Terrible service.  That was the last thing I needed after spending all day at the Cleveland Clinic."}
{"text":"Went with my mother for a late lunch yesterday because she had a gift card.  Not crowded, slow service.  This irritated my mother, although much of the delay was due to the senior tables that insist that the waitress tell them every single ingredient in every dish three times.  I had the cod dinner ($10.99) which was a nice sized piece of fish with a coating so hard that you had to cut it with a knife.  My mother had two eggs with three slices of bacon for $6.99 which I thought was ridiculous.  Didn't get bread with our meals so they boxed us up a couple of slices of banana and blueberry bread."}
{"text":"Waitress was very friendly. Us in right away food was not bad it just wasn't the best it is a friendly Hometown type of place."}
{"text":"Today, my son and I went to Bob Evans for dinner and wanted a quick dinner. It's a school night and with me working late, it was an easy stop on our way home from Costco. Over the years, Bob Evans (this particular location) has started to decline in service. Either the previous servers have left or has been replaced with other servers that do not understand good customer service or work ethics. I, myself has served in multiple restaurants during college, but never have I been rude disrespect or disregard a paying guest. 

I was absolutely nice and kind to our server. She didn't greet our table until five minutes later, which I let go. She took our drink order and food order at the same time but did not bring our drinks out until another five minutes later. Again, I let it go. I understand the restaurant business, maybe it's short-staffed, I don't know, but the restaurant was NOT busy to be this lousy with service. 

The worse part is when it came to paying the bill, I had to wait 15 minutes, looked around for my server, and another server pointed out that there is a customer needing something seeing me move my head around and making eye contact with other servers. As he (another server) pointed me out, there was another server that said, as she flipped her hand at me, 'I'm done with my shift, I ain't worried about that table.' 

At this point I was fuming, I wanted to be out of the restaurant by 7:00 PM, but since I was waiting for my bill and looking for my server, we were out of there at 7:30 PM. I even told the manager, 'I can't find my server and I need to pay my bill.' His response, 'Oh I see her, but I don't know what she's doing.' Never in my life have I ever experienced young adults with such poor work ethics. It was completely disheartening to experience this type of service from the server and leadership from the manager. I will never return to this location, Bob Evans again."}
{"text":"Its been a little while since I have visited any location. I frequent this one the most its in the neighborhood and convenient. They must have changed their staffing drastically, i see not one familiar face except the manager. This is a good change, thw servers are attentive to their patrons and seem likw they actually care a little at least."}
{"text":"Second time here already better than the first. Hostess friendlier, waitress much more fun and calm. Might have been a bad night, it was a Friday and it was kinda busy for being as late as it was."}
{"text":"Only gave it 1 star cause its the only way to write a review. The service was horrible and that's too much of a compliment."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming to the Bob Evans if not just for the food but for the, the service our favorite servers at this restaurant are the fabulous Judy The Sensational Paula and of course ever caddy JC however they were not there this morning when I attended my breakfast I had the lovely Shana I think that's her name I ordered the typical farmer's choice eggs over medium hash brown French toast no powdered sugar extra butter and a ham steak I received my food in a timely manner my eggs however were undercooked they were over easy my hash browns were overcooked they were dark brown the French toast and could have been cooked a little longer but I ate it lots of butter syrup no powdered sugar the staff one lovely birthday girl with Expediting the window she turned 25 today woohoo managers were back on the line cooking. After I mentioned to the general manager Megan about my eggs she conveniently took them off my ticket thank you very much Megan my recommendation would be Bob Evans unlike my previous experience two and a half hours ago at the Cracker Barrel witches was simply horrible"}
{"text":"if i could give this place less than one star, i would.  we were seated after a few minute wait, however it went downhill from there.  while we were waiting for a server, we saw three other tables that were seated behind us receiving attention from other servers.  we called the hostess over and asked if someone was supposed to be working our section.  she took our beverage order and said she would send someone by.  meanwhile, another server noticed that we hadn't been seen by anyone yet. she offered to go find someone.  

at the 15 minute mark, with no server and no beverages in sight, we got up and left.  on the way out, we asked for the manager, who was behind the counter plating up food.  after complaining about the non-service, she stated that she was \"just about to get our drinks.\"  

no thanks!  

we went to the perkins across the street and our server took our drink orders before we even took off our coats and sat down.  that server got an extraordinary tip.."}
{"text":"The food is usually good but the service is usually terrible. Most of the servers are agonizingly slow and you have a 50/50 chance of getting the right order."}
{"text":"Service is so slow. Took over 15 minutes to be seated. Then another 15 minutes to bring coffee and orange juice. It has been about 40 minutes and no sign of our food. We have a long drive ahead of us and this place is putting us way behind. It isn't even busy in here.  I heard such great things about the food here but apparently everything else is lacking."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service at Bob's. Good breakfast for the money. Biscuits are exceptionally good."}
{"text":"This was OK, not the best and but not horrible (at least for us). A bit of a wait to get in, plenty of food choices (except they don't serve grits after 11am, boo), it was crowded with people waiting when we left but there were un-bussed tables inside, maybe they had people call in sick that day. One couple left after waiting 15 minutes and nobody showed up to take their order, the table next to us called the waitress back after delivering the food as the turkey sandwich didn't have any turkey. We lucked out I guess, no issues, food came fairly fast, price was OK, it was like a mid-tier restaurant, a good place to stop for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"Lori greeted me and waited on my table.  Promptly served coffee and breakfast.  Her smiles lifted this Traveler's spirits in a snowy Cleveland morning.  Traditional morning breakfast was excellent."}
{"text":"Would love to be able to rate this restaurant but we were seated and waited 10 minutes.  No server, manager, etc game to the table so we left.  

HORRIBLE customer service.  STAY AWAY from this location.  Happens every time we try to patronize this restaurant.

If zero stars was an option....that would be too many."}
{"text":"I am a Bob EVANS fan.  But I noticed that they are getting SKIMPY on there portions and the price of food has gradually gone up in price.  B.E needs to watch this or they will skimp and we will not eat there because of the price to food ratio.  Come on BOB..lol"}
{"text":"Service is going down hill in a hand basket this time.  rolls came at the end of the meal, the mash potatoes had no salt, and the food was cold"}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here while driving from Chicago to New Jersey.  Bathroom was disgusting. Feminine products on floor, trash overflowing. Coeslaw looked liked soup and turkey sausage was undercooked. Biscuits and gravy was decent. Server was friendly."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the service and the food was just ok. 

I kept seeing all of the Bob Evans commercials about the family meals to go and I was curious, so I went online to order a meal. I ordered the country fried steak, salad and sweet tea. They said it would take 20 minutes; I was 5 minutes late and I called as the sign instructed when I pulled outside, this is when it started going bad. 

The young man who answered seemed like he could've used a little more training and phone etiquette. 

When I told him my name he said \"WHO?!\" And I asked him if that's what he just said, bc I was surprised by the way he said it. He said \"yeah I didn't hear you\" I gave him my name again and he said \"oh yeah, that's going to be 5 more minutes\"

12 minutes later a young man came out with my bag, I briefly checked the contents and asked if I wanted gravy for my steak. I told him yes and he went back to get it. 

When I got home, my food was not hot and I only live 7 minutes away. The tea was not sweet tea but instead unsweetened. I was very disappointed. I guess I'll have to limit my take out orders."}
{"text":"1st time at a Bob Evans. Pretty bad overall. Mediocre food, slow service, & overpriced. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I like Bob Evans

I come from Hawaii, and saw this place all over Ohio.  We tried it out, and ordered take out so that we could eat back at the hotel rooms.  The service was amazing, the girl that took my order was really friendly.  The food portions were incredible for the price.  Most are under $10. 
Also I got a $2 off coupon on my receipt for completing an online survey.

Cons: none that I could see, and the wait time was reasonable for our food. About 15-20 minutes. But those can seem like an eternity if you are hungry like we were"}
{"text":"I got made fun of last night for having never been to a Bob Evans... so first thing my friend and I did this morning was come to Bob Evans for breakfast. Our waitress was Barb and she was absolutely incredible. She had such an awesome personality, was super attentive, funny, and non judgmental with our craziness with ordering practically everything on the menu. They had a pretty wide selection of food too! We had a few bites of everything we ordered which was the chocolate chip pancakes, French toast, crepes (yes get these!!!), a customized omelette, and the candied bacon appetizer. YES IT WAS DELISH! We did end up taking most of it home but we will definitely be back soon!!!! Thanks for such great service Barb!"}
{"text":"I've tried giving this place a chance. The service is absolutely horrible. I bet I have been here 3 times in a year and each time gets worse. My family loves breakfast for dinner and I think I could have made it faster myself."}
{"text":"After a 5 hour a drive and feeling like I was had been in a 12 hour convoy with no cruise control.

I will always be a Bob Evans fan especially  over fast food.   They have made some changes to their menu by reducing the prices of some of their traditional staples (Chicken Noodle Dinner / Meatloaf dinner,).

Eat at Bob's :-)"}
{"text":"Mhmmm gonna hafta drop it a star or two here.  We enjoyed the following during our last 2 visits:

Crispy hockey pucks for biscuits
Blue sugar syrup for reviving diabetics instead of blueberry syrup
Smokehouse sauce?  A little barfy.
OMG could we wait a little longer for ________ (fill in the blank: menus, ordering, food, condiments, check)
That cranky waitress was back again!!
And a bathroom that smells like someone mopped the floor with vintage You-Rine.  (You ever go to wash your hands and you feel like you just made them dirtier?)"}
{"text":"This is the WORST Bob Evans restaurant I have patronized.  Every time I come here it is a 45 minute to an hour wait to be seated.  It isn't because they are that busy, it is because the staff is absolutely horrible.  There are plenty of open tables that aren't used, tables that are dirty and were not cleared from the previous patrons, however the staff is simply too lazy to seat those tables.  I will never take my family to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Just a good breakfast place that has become, Stingy with their homemade biscuits ! So, good bye Bob !!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! This review is for breakfast only, our dinner experience here was so bad I will just pretend it didn't happen. But breakfast!!, that's why this place is here, great coffee , eggs are real, good service, prices are reasonable, and good family atmosphere"}
{"text":"I only have eaten in at this Bob Evans once, but I've gotten take-out too many times to count, and on both fronts, I had nothing but good experiences here. The time that I ate in with my boyfriend, we were served efficiently and the food was hot and cooked well (we had breakfast that day). The times I ordered take-out for dinner, I was absolutely impressed, as my food was always still hot by the time I got it home. It was never cold or rubbery, which can sometimes happen with take-out. I think Bob Evans avoided that by being nearly spot-on about their estimates of how long it should take every single time. I never waited more than 5 minutes in the restaurant to pick up my order. The prices are great all around, and they have a great deal of variety on their dinner menu. It's a chain restaurant, so they don't really specialize in their dinner food, but it's still a solid place to grab a cheap and varied meal."}
{"text":"Delicious blueberry waffles and pancakes. Friendly wait staff that got the order correct. Amazing, savory sausage patties. Crunchy and perfect hash browns. Very nice lighting and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The place was great when it first opened. A couple years on and it seems as though it's on its way downhill. The attentiveness and knowledge of your server will vary greatly. There are some attentive servers here, but they are few and far between. The accuracy of your order will vary, as well, either on the part of the server (there's high turnover, methinks) or who's flinging food in the kitchen. 

I don't think its death is imminent, despite the slow evenings. Weekends are the busiest times and it's one of the few sit down and be served joints with reasonable prices for breakfast/brunch.  The food is still tasty. 

If you have a problem, ask for a manager and present your case in a CIVIL manner. They want to make your visit right and educate the employee."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and park over in a different lot so an old person doesn't back into your car and drive away"}
{"text":"The place were the Midwest eats. We stopped for breakfast and the place was packed. We wanted an order of the multi- grain pancakes. As usual they are very satisfying. I suspect by drowning them in syrup defeats the purpose of the multi- grain, but they are good!"}
{"text":"Review for 4 people, Sunday breakfast before our 10a flight. I'm from California and comparing this with Denny's and IHOP.

Got the biscuits and gravy, with hash browns - so good! Not greasy like Denny's or IHOPs. 

Their link sausages are wonderful! MUST GET THIS!

We also had French toast - really good! 

Will be back if we're looking for breakfast before getting to the airport!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here often and it is ok.  I always order the same thing - Wildfire Chicken  salad which I just love and I have no complaints about the food.  However, the service is terrible.  We were there about 11:30 on a Monday morning.  Took about 5 minutes before anyone showed up to find a table for us - we had our 12 year old granddaughter with us.  After about 10 minutes the server showed up and took our drink orders.  After about another 10 minutes she came back and took our food orders.  The food was fine and we enjoyed the meal.  However, that was the last time we saw our server.  She disappeared.  We had finished eating and my granddaughter wanted to use the facilities and my husband went to wait outside the door for us while I waited for our check.  No one showed up - then I asked another server where the server was and was told she didn't know.  I asked her for our bill.  After about 10 minutes my husband was concerned and came back to see what had happened to us.  The server still didn't show up.  Finally, another server came by and placed the chick on the table and left.  No explanation, no apology  - nothing.  The service here is always slow but this was beyond slow.  I couldn't find the manager so sent an email to corporate when I came home.  That was a week ago and I've never even received an acknowledgement of them receiving my email.  I strongly suggest going elsewhere - Cracker Barrel and Eat 'n Park are both directly across the street.  Go to one of them."}
{"text":"A wonderful establishment. The food is great and tasty as any other Bob Evans, but the staff here are exceptional. Very genuine, Southern, and I honestly feel like they love me as family even though I was there one time. Everyone from the waiters, to the staff, to the manager. Thank you for a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"This place is the worst Bob Evans I have ever been to. Food is always cold and bland. Boyfriends sandwich came out looking like someone smashed their fingers in the bun. Bob Evans had really gone downhill in quality over the last decade. Service here is not the greatest either. Neglected by servers and the young manager was not attentive."}
{"text":"After having blood work done, both of us, at Cle clinic, we came to bob Evans for brunch expecting slow service and mediocre food. This time was great... Service was nice and the food was great. Eggs perfect, refills on coffee, professional service with smiles..."}
{"text":"We don't really eat out that often anymore due to my health and the challenges that I am presented with in getting out somewhere where I won't get jostled about bumped into or where noise and vibrations are present all of which could easily cause a very painful and embarrassing flare up so when we do go out it is a real treat. Most months we can usually get out just once and on a really good month maybe twice. *Please see the end of this review for my disabled person accessibility assessment. The menu selection is broad enough to satisfy differing tastes and they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Bob Evans specializing in breakfast serves it all day with all their food being tasty, served at the proper temperature and portions adequate for the average adult. The hostesses, servers and management have always been attentive but not overly so and I would give them 4 out of 5 stars. We have never had longer than a ten-minute wait to be seated but we do typically go weeknights after 6 pm. They have free Wi-Fi which you will need to sign into their network to gain access to it. Finally, while we have never ordered dessert ourselves they do have desserts that look appetizing we just never seem to have the room to order dessert.
 
*Disabled person accessibility assessment: Please note that I am a large man and I use one of the larger motorized wheelchairs and I drive a full size van with a wheelchair lift not a ramp and I find that the parking access for disabled persons is better than most with well-marked large parking spots and multiple van accessible spots. I just wish they would have made the front sidewalk accessible on both sides however the side with accessible parking is the only one at the same height as the parking surface. We have gone when all accessible spots were occupied and while there were regular parking spots that I could use without issue even with the lift on the opposite side of their parking lot when using these parking spots I had to keep my wheelchair in the path of traffic until reaching the opposite side of the lot where I could finally gain access to their sidewalk. The exterior as well as the interior doors were all unlocked both on the right and left hand sides with all operating effortlessly. The tables were a good height, accommodating and arranged with adequate access on at least two to three sides. Still just a little disappointed that even after going there several times now that we have yet to have a hostess or server adept enough to have already readied the table by removing a chair or chairs to allow for my ease and immediate seating. I felt bad as they fumbled about clumsily trying to figure out what to do with the chair once they removed it from the table as I and others were trying to occupy the table that they led us to. The restrooms are fully accessible with sufficient room for even those in the largest of the motorized wheelchairs and the sink, soap dispenser, towels and waste container are all within easy reach and I found everything to operate effortlessly."}
{"text":"I came here with my grandma and was immediately seated. The food was amazing once we got it. Service amazing. I only give this place four stars because it took some time for us to get our food. But other than that the place was clean, waitress was nice, and food was great."}
{"text":"It hurts me to my heart to downgrade my review of this restaurant from 4-stars to 3, but since we've had issues the last few visits they left me no choice. The rolls, which used to be fresh, have been stale and crumbly. This has been the case the last couple of visits. When I asked to have them changed the last time we were here, the exchanged batch were no better. The vegetables on my plate were delivered cold this time around. 
I had chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. Aside from the cold green beans, my food was good. Their chicken gravy is excellent. My husband had blueberry pancakes and sausage links and he enjoyed his. I might stick with breakfast more often going forward. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. 
I hope they will step up their game. They could use better table cleaners. We almost always have to wipe off our seats before we sit down, and usually the floor has food or other garbage under it. The last time we came here my husband said there'd been some water backup in the bathroom. 
Bob Evans has so much potential, but they need to put in more effort and they'd have a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now and the service has been horrible. The first time I went, I thought that the server we had may just have been having an off day. But then I went again a second time and had the same server and she was just as bad. First of all, she was rude to my mother. My mother is gluten sensitive and she had some questions about substitutions and the menu. She was downright rude and not helpful. She also seemed like she was flustered when she only had 3 tables total in her section. She also did not keep drinks filled; I had finished my coffee and was hoping for another cup, but it took her at least 15 minutes to come back to our table.

Our food took FOREVER to come out. We ordered around 10:30am and did not receive our food until around 11:20. The food should not have taken that long for the amount of people that were in the restaurant. My sisters boyfriend had to go to school a bit after class and he was almost late. 

I gave this location a second chance but I have decided that I will not be returning.

Although the service was bad, I still tipped the waitress 20% because I know how much of a server's paycheck comes from tips (pretty much all of it, actual pay checks are not much money at all)."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate zero stars. We were two of 10 people in the place and the service was horrible. Our waitress came back only with our food for a refill. My wife's chicken was not cooked, neither of our fries were cooked. Will never return"}
{"text":"I have to be honest...I was not a fan of the food. The service was decent; waited a few more minutes that I think I should have to be seated. I feel like a hostess should be at the front at all times, unless she is actually doing something...I don't think that was the case but whatever. The food was honestly below average compared to other Bob Evan's I've been to. The food to me is better at IHOP than here. I'll try again some other time..."}
{"text":"Totally horrible tonight!  Chicken tenders cold and tough, carrots raw, potatoes in soup raw.  I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Nothing special to say about the food, as Bob Evans pretty much delivers the same food every time.  Instead, I'll note the service here.  Our waitress took our drink order relatively quickly after we were seated, and returned with our drink order a couple minutes later.

That would be the last time we would see her until our food was served about 20 minutes later.  In the meantime, my wife had to go to the counter/wait station to ask for a refill of her coffee.  This was a little surprising as, even during a busy time like a Sunday morning, there is usually someone coming around with coffee for refills.

Okay, where is that locally owned breakfast diner in Avon I'm looking for..."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning. It wasn't too packed. We were seated fairly quickly. The water was in a mason jar which gave it a nice country feel, however the cup was dirty and not wiped good enough. The hash browns were a little hard. I usually like them softer.
I wasn't all that impressed. Just another chain restaurant. The inside was nicely decorated. Servers were nice and polite."}
{"text":"I love me some Bob Evans, but where I live out west doesn't have any. So, I was quite excited to see this place. We actually ate breakfast / lunch here twice while in town and it was great.  First off, this place apparently just reopened after a remodel and it looks great. We were there with big groups both times (party of 9 one day and 7 on another) and the folks were super helpful in getting us seated right away. Everyone's food was delicious on both occasions--we pretty much worked through a large swatch of the menu, so I think you can't go wrong with anything they have to offer. Great coffee and oj too. Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Wildfire chicken salad was excellent and the if you like your eggs thin rather then thick for your omelet as I do it was outstanding.  

****update****
Constancy is everything...
Ordered my same wildfire chicken salad, it was drenched in sauce, changing the taste completely and missing half the ingredients the prior salad had :( 
I had to reduce my rating to 3 stars"}
{"text":"It's a Bob Evans, you pretty much know what you're going to get menu and food wise.

This review is all for the service. We went three times while we were in the area, had mom with me and when she finds a place she likes, we continue to go back.

We had Mike as a server each night. He was a delight."}
{"text":"Customer service it top notch at this Bob Evans Restaurant. Hostess rewashed our table as she didnt likw the way it looked. Even wiped the menus before giving them to us. Waitress was very attentive. Evan asked if I wanted a coffee to go. We have never had this high quality of service at any other Bob Evans. Kudos to your staff for all your hard work. Keep up the amazing job. Oh.. and the food was very good too. 

Bob & Karen"}
{"text":"I LOVE Bob Evans, but this restaurant is particularly friendly.  I've been here a few times, often early on weekends with a hangover, but the staff is always very kind and patient in taking my order.  The food is served very quickly and the staff is good about making switches or adjustments if you have dietary restrictions.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Maybe not even one star
Went there Sunday morning and walked in on a crowd with a 30 minute wait
Turned out to be 45
Min wait 
Finally sitting down but next to the bathrooms?
Uck!
I had raw liquid centered grain pancakes
Wife had stale English muffin with 1/2 cooked fatty bacon
My mom ordered fried mush and got it so over cooked you could drow it on the floor and it will not break? WTH?
We paid $36.00 for crap food and $5.00 tip
I don't recommend eating there ever again"}
{"text":"I can't complain about the food at Bob Evan.s We haven't had a bad dish.  The service at this one was a struggle.  We were there for over an hour, when  I think we could've been in and out in about 40 minutes. It was about 4pm, not too busy and we waited patiently as we were starving.  

I think I'll pass this one by next time."}
{"text":"The service is typical of the area--AWFUL!
The servers are too chatty and the food came out cold. not worth the long wait and time."}
{"text":"Kudos for being the only place open Christmas morning.  Adequate food done quickly and with awesome service.  I give the server 4 stars, the food and atmosphere 3 stars.  Its a cheap chain restaurant, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"Yum, we had a great dinner here last night! We stopped by after heading to the craft show at the covention center. My family had all intentions on going to Denny's, but when we passed by this Bob Evans we changed our mine. Surprisingly, i believe this was my first time eating here. The other times we stopped by as a kid was for take out.

Anyways, for dinner they have a great option of home-style meals that qualify for the 3 course dinner. The meals for example are Black Angus Steak, Sirloin, Country Fried Steak, Meatloaf, Blackened Whitefish, Pot Roast, Slow Cooked Chicken & Noodles over mashed potatoes and Turkey. They all came with a side that complimented the dish, but you could swap for any side. Also, for the 3 course option, you got to choose between soup or salad. There was also a lengthy list of desserts such as a variety of sundaes, cookie to go, scoop of ice cream, fruit cup or $1 more for a slice of pie. This option was so great and the total for all of that was $10.99. All of these meals are on the regular menu for about $8-10 so the extra for starter and dessert was great! Oh, you also get unlimited choice of biscuits or rolls.

I ordered the blackened fish which came with a baked potato. The fish was not bad. It had sauteed veggies on top. I loved my baked potato and it's been a while since i've had one. The fish wasn't bad at all-- had a little spice to it. Bobby & my uncle both ordered the country fried steak w/ mashed potatoes and gravy. It looked tasty. Bobby didnt finish his and i tried it. Not bad but the gravy wasn't the best--- veryyyy salty. My grandma ordered the chicken & noodles over mashed potatoes. She said it was very good but filling and took over half home with her. The broccoli and cheese soup was tasty as well.  We were all full and ordered a cookie to go for dessert. 

Our server was Woody and she was a sweetie. She was about to go on maternity leave at the end of the week and was going to be a new mommy, how exciting. 

Nice meal with my amazing family. We don't get to see eachother too often. :)"}
{"text":"My son and I eat there regularly but just yesterday they messed up my sons order I sent I sent it back and I was sitting at the bar (meaning the diner part). the cook threw his hands up in the air, rolled his eyes and starting slamming equipment around-extremely rude. I am sure something was done to my child's food. I will find someplace comparable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late breakfast. Unfortunately we got a waitress who didn't want to be there. After 10 minutes We ordered the overpriced $4.34  coffee, two cups and water with lemon. Waitress brought the coffee and no water.  Ask for water again. 5 minutes later she came back and took order and no water. Ask for it again. 15 minutes later waitress brought our order but no toast for me and no water plus by then over priced coffee was empty. Again ask for water and more coffee. I eventually ask another waitress to bring me some toast. Then original waitress brought the water but no lemon. Still no coffee refill.  Just excuses.  By now waitress has an attitude. We did eventually get the overpriced coffee refill. Sunny side eggs were scorched. Sausage links has zero taste. Hash browns were probably frozen but good. We more than likely won't go back. We always go decent service at other locations."}
{"text":"I used to love Bob Evans but recently their food quality has gone downhill. Their strawberries are not fresh and their sausage tastes like it was frozen and then cooked in the microwave. I will not be coming back here for a long time."}
{"text":"Best breakfast it's an old go to. Great food and service. Sausage gravey is always a hit, OH! Don't forget the best biscuits.  It's home to an old farm boy."}
{"text":"Our weekend breakfast go to. Can't beat the Farmer's Choice breakfast. The French toast is yummy!"}
{"text":"The waiter was slow in taking our order and largely ignored us during our meal. The food--a chicken salad and hamburger--tasted OK."}
{"text":"These other reviews are years old, so maybe the restaurant has improved since then. Today I had a breakfast with a large group of people. Our table was clean. The waitress was nice. She brought out our food promptly, but she mixed up a couple of plates and receipts. I ordered bacon, eggs, a blueberry crepe, hash browns--a simple meal that is hard to mess up. I liked the taste of all of the food. The other people in my group ordered different things, and they all enjoyed their food. My total bill for me was $12 (including tax and tip). Remember to pay at the cashier near the door."}
{"text":"The service from my waitress at this Bob Evans was good. The food, though, was just OK. I ordered my typical dishes that I always got in the past at other locations of Bob Evans, and this time they tasted a bit bland."}
{"text":"We waited a while for an employee to seat us. The glass windows that separate the booths are dirty with splashed liquid. We ordered appetizers, entrees, and desserts. The waitress forgot to bring out my husband's banana bread, so we reminded her. She said that the kitchen was too busy to cut the bread. She brought out our entrees of pot roast, which tasted good, and country-fried steak, which tasted mediocre. The waitress came by again, still without the bread. She finally brought out the bread, making an excuse that it just came out of the oven so was probably hot. I immediately put my fingertip on the bread, and it felt cold. I did not like how the waitress lied to cover up her mistake of forgetting to bring the bread earlier. Later she asked us if we needed anything else, and we had to remind her that we had ordered dessert. She brought out the desserts. We had to ask for refills for our empty cups. That waitress needs to improve her service. Price was $30 total for two people."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my two kids. They ordered kids meals and I ordered the sirloin steak. I wish I could post a picture on yelp! My \"steak\" looked like the neck of a turkey that is pulled from the carcass. I told the waitress \"I'm sorry but I can't eat this\" the girl said \"eww! I'm sorry Ill get my manager\". The manager came over and said \"we've been having really bad problems with our meat distributor lately.\" Seriously?!! What manager in their right mind would let food that awful looking to be served, but then admits that they have problems with their meat?! 
So he took the steak off of my bill (but charged me with the mediocre soup) and he added a side of bacon and a strawberry iced tea (both were never ordered) to my bill to make up for the amount!!!! I told the waitress I didn't order these so that same manager took off the tea but moved the bacon to under one of the kids meals on the check! Like I wouldn't notice! So they took off the imaginary side of bacon, dropped off the check, without an apology and didn't return to the table. I was not rude to any of the employees yet still I had to stand up like an idiot until I could get the attention of a girl bussing tables to ask her for a box for my daughters strawberry bread (which was the only success for the day).
I wish I could give zero stars. I worked in restaurants through out college and have NEVER seen such horrible management. I will NEVER return to this Bob Evans and will strongly urge anyone I know to do the same. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Never come to this restaurant! Their food is horrible! This is supposed to be an omelet. The vegetables were old and some were dead. Avoid this place if you can. I would rather starve."}
{"text":"While in Ohio for Twins Days with my twin sister and grandtwins, we loved breakfast at Bob Evans with piping hot coffee and the banana bread in the bread basket was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Well ,had a great breakfast, 
The only thing Was, thete was no wait nut yet we had to wait,  while they bussed a party of 20 table,....service was grest , food was great , bathroom was clean,.
Price was right...overall always a good experience!"}
{"text":"Took my grandkids there this week, but they told me they don't want to go back. Thin portions, including SIX French fries with my granddaughters' chicken tenders order ......and, no rolls or bread ever provided even after we asked for them. We finished our 'meals' then went to Publix, bought some deli dinners and went home to actually have dinner. Restaurant sure wasn't busy.....only 6 people there the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"Terrible servers who hate their jobs. Slow slow service. Can't even check out because no one wants to come to the register and would rather ignore the patrons."}
{"text":"Bob Evans is a popular chain in the midwest.  If you want basic sausage, homefries and eggs, you will be satisfied.  Omelets have slipped a bit.  They sell basic hearty comfort food for lunch and dinner.  Their sweet and sour salad dressing is very yummy and available for sale to take home.  Biscuits and honey are not to be missed.  They are trying to introduce healthier items, but they generally are not exciting to taste.  Service has always been attentive and friendly.  Overall, you will get okay food at a reasonable price, but nothing special"}
{"text":"This is an excellent Bob Evans. A new design, ALWAYS clean. Food is always excellent and all the staff are friendly, warm, and accommodating. The manager is very friendly and Brittany especially is an excellent server."}
{"text":"Bob Evans has evolved over time, with the changing American diet.  It's strengths have always been its breakfast, and that has not changed.  It used to be designed for travelers, but it seems to have shifted to cater to the locals.  Gone are the gift shops stocked with travel toys and they have been replaced with bakery goods.  Breakfasts are good, salads are OK, entrees are meh.  My personal favorite is the biscuits with honey as a side for breakfast.  Service here is attentive and friendly.  A good stop on the Streetsboro strip."}
{"text":"I don't post much. I have to say that I couldn't be more disappointed in this Bob Evans. Every time I visited a Bob Evans I was satisfied. Maybe not overwhelmed, but satisfied. Today I could have not been more disappointed. Understandably the Bob Evans was having issues with their POS system. While this is happening they were not allowing any food that was vegetarian to come out of the kitchen. I left my family at the restaurant while I left due to the fact that I am not eating meat for Lent. It seemed as though management didn't care. This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I was there with my mother and there were hardly any customers, we waited longer than we should have for our burgers and fries. The food was delicious but we had to ask for silverware, and they also forgot to put pickles in my mom's burger and tomato on mine. The service has been much better in the past."}
{"text":"I love Bob Evans but my last trip there was horrible thanks to the waitress. it was an older lady(NOT Louanne, she's my favorite). we got there around 8:15, I know they close at 9 but back when I was a waitress, closing at 9 meant you take the last table at 9, not everyone HAS TO be out by 9.

but the waitress kept rushing us to order, and the second time she came back she mentioned they were trying to clean up for the night. should've left then. our food came out in less than 10 minutes which was nice, her comment wasn't. something about how \"the cook wanted to leave so he hurried up and made this\".
our checks came with our meal and she never came back to refill or offer dessert. 
mind you when we left, there were still a few tables with people so it wasn't like they were leaving at 9 anyways.

the whole time I felt like I had to leave asap cuz they didn't want me there."}
{"text":"While I do love their Heritage Chef Salad, I have to give this two stars. It would probably be more accurate at 1.5 but I'll round up. 

The service at this location is terrible, I rarely stiff a waitress but this is the third time we've been here and had bad service. No one pays attention to the customers and all the employees hoard around the take out station and talk. My husband ordered the chicken pot pie and watched it sit under the heat lamp for over eight minutes. There were almost no customers, only two more tables there and more than enough free staff to run food. By the time we got our food the pot pie was dried out and gross. I'm not sure why it sat up there as all I ordered was a salad. I used to love Bob Evans but this location we won't be going back to."}
{"text":"Went at 5pm before the dinner rush. 

Good food. Good service."}
{"text":"Avoid this location at all costs.  Spend the time to drive a few minutes down the road to the other location in Mentor, Ohio. 

 We came in on a Friday morning for 8am for breakfast.  The restaurant was semi busy and we were seated right away.  It took us almost 20 minutes to get coffee and hot water for tea.  Our food took another 20 minutes and when it came out, two people in our group were handed food and the person (not our waiter) looked at me and was like \"you didn't get anything\" and I said no I did. So they had zero idea what was going on at any point. My food came 10 minutes later (and it was cold).  

The best part is when I ordered a slice of strawberry pie to go. Our waitress gave us our check and said that if we didn't want to wait at the table for the pie we can pick it up when we pay.  We waited 15 minutes and never got the pie so, as we had been there over an hour for a quick breakfast we went up to pay where we were exposed to the nastiest older woman I have encountered in customer service.  

 I explained to this woman nicely that I had paid for a slice of pie and was told I could pick it up here.  She ignored me and grabbed my receipt, threw my change back in my hands and I then again inquired about the pie and she accused me of not paying for it (I showed her the receipt). Then she said \"it is not my problem.\"  I said to her actually working here and at the register it is your problem and you need to help me. 

 Eventually another nicer woman walked over to us to help while the old nasty woman was basically screaming at me.  It was disgusting.  You need to learn to train your employees in customer service.  I would never come back to this location ever again.  We had members of our party who were extremely upset, and who never complain disgusted by this woman. 

Terrible experience."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Cleveland, I was looking for that trendy breakfast spot (I'm from California) to begin a long day.  Passing by this Bob Evans, my Indiana nostalgia kicked in and I decided to give it a whirl.  It was filled with old farmers, and many smiles.  Just the atmosphere I was hoping for.

I ordered the market breakfast something or other.  It came with eggs, bacon, and gravy.  By the way, I forgot that in the Midwest a \"side of gravy\" literally means \"a heaping bowl of gravy with two large biscuits\".  As I wasn't going to be plowing the fields that day, I only had a few bites - but HOLY COW was it delicious!  All the fat and salt you could ever want to spread on your butter soaked biscuits and it was everything I could have hoped for and more!

Ok, the coffee was amazing (I'm serious), the staff was great, and everything else was fine.  It was the perfect way to start my day and I just felt relaxed and satisfied.  I never thought I'd be reviewing a Bob Evan's, but the experience was so good I just had to take the time."}
{"text":"This is an amazing breakfast or brunch restaurant. I personally like the breakfast better than their lunch or steak etc. Last time I was there, I tried the sausage patties which were included in my meal (Homestead Meal), they were not as good as the breakfast. Wow, the eggs were delicious (I ordered sunny side up), and with the eggs, you can order some kind of bread. I suggest the white toast, but if you don't like butter, you wouldn't like it because t is covered in butter. I also recommend the hot chocolate. When I went here in Sandusky, there weren't many people there and it still took them a long time to serve my food, but our server was super nice and kid friendly and I think it's so funny that all of the Bob Evans restaurants look exactly the same! Overall, I like the restaurant's breakfast and drinks better."}
{"text":"The first couple times I came here it just opened and it was great. Today everything is awful. The service it the worst ever!"}
{"text":"Who knew that one would  hear  decent selections of music playing while sipping on coffee inside a Bob Evans.

I  am discovering that there isn't a whole lot of consistency regarding food preparation from one Bob Evans to another.  Some locations do a better job with proper timing, accurate temperatures and presentation. There is, however, real consistency regarding the attention  and friendly service they provide.  Great server tonight.  She was  really busy with several tables and still kept a positive attitude.
I would consider returning here based on my experience with the  server and knowing that perhaps another cook would prepare the meal differently."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. The wait staff is slow. I have to constantly ask for refills and the wait staff acts as though they are doing me a favor. As I currently sit here they are out of placemats and the floor is disgusting.  I have been waiting over an hour for my food. Please do not eat here. Management clearly does not have any staffing, timelines, or cleanliness standards. To whom it may concern we left. The manager tried to make it right. The waitress was not happy."}
{"text":"Worst Bob Evans ever. Wanted to place a take out order, waited for 5 mins & nobody even took care of us. The employees looked at us & nobody said a word. Walked right out!"}
{"text":"Bob Evans isn't my favorite place to eat but, I do like their pot roast sandwich, fried chicken, & wildfire chicken salad at the Middleburg Heights location. 

Not all chains are the same. I ordered the pot roast sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. I really shouldn't have. The sandwich was kind of soggy when I got it & the meat didn't look very appetizing. The mac & cheese was COLD & I had to ask the server to take it back. I really didn't care for the server, she seemed like she had an attitude & was very forgetful. Not only that, there was hardly anyone in the restaurant at the time & it took awhile to get my table's food. 

I'm not going back to this Bob Evan's, I'll stick to going to the one in Middleburg!"}
{"text":"Bob Evans has great broasted chicken, just not THIS Bob Evans. We ordered an 8 piece chicken to go, which was advertised as 2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 wings, and 2 legs. We ordered it for a specific pick up time (an hour and half after calling it in), and ordered two sides, and two gravies. After waiting ten minutes past the pick up time, we got 3 thighs, 2 wings, 2 legs and 1 breast. On top of that, the chicken was dry, old, cold, and disgusting. We only got one of the gravies, and the sides were less than fresh. Unfortunately, this was not the first time we have been disappointed here, but we gave them a second, and a third chance. If you are going to order out for Bob Evans, I suggest you skip the Chardon OH location, and just go to another location. This will be my last time at that restaurant. Gross."}
{"text":"I usually visit this Bob Evans on the weekend for breakfast. I always sit at the bar, so I never have to wait to be seated. The staff are friendly and attentive. Some of the customers are regulars and easy to start conversations with. Food is always good. I almost always order the home style breakfast. Great place!"}
{"text":"Staying in one of the hotels next to the restaurant, I decided to give them a go for breakfast to avoid driving somewhere.

My experience from start to finish drove home that this is a popular restaurant with many regular customers.  Which is both good and bad.  On the good side, everyone I interacted with (including the couple at the table next to mine) were ridiculously friendly.  The host and server were exceptionally nice, and service was quick and professional.  Watching the servers interact with some of the other tables, I knew I was in a place where \"everybody knows your name.\"

Now to the bad side.  I wanted breakfast, so ordered something simple.  Two eggs over easy, home fries and pancakes.  The food arrived quickly and looked nice and fresh.  Unfortunately, nothing was seasoned.  It's a rare occurrence when I actually have to use the salt and pepper at the table, but it was the only way to get any flavor out of what I ate.  I'm going to attribute this to the regular, mostly senior clientele that I could tell the restaurant got.  I'll most likely return later this week as I'm here for a few more days, so hopefully this was an isolated incident.

At least I can say this place won't leave a bad taste in your mouth!"}
{"text":"A group of coworkers went to Bob Evans during lunch time.  there were 7 of us.  It took 10 minutes to place our drink order.  another 10 minutes to receive our drinks.  We placed our order and got it 40 minutes later.  The meals came out 2 meals at a time, with the first person being done eating before the last person got their food.  3 of the 7 orders were wrong and cold.  Pancakes were dropped by the waitress.  Grant it the other only got soup and salad and that too took forever to get.  It was the worst service I ever experienced.  The manager was only willing to give a 20% discount and basically dismissed us.  This is terrible as I normally love Bob Evans.  We won't be going back to this one for sure."}
{"text":"We recently visited Bob Evans with a large group (8 people.) Their quoted wait time was spot on (10 min) and our service was speedy and accurate.  The food was good and we were in an out of there in less than an hour.  They kept hot coffee on the table and the food was prepare is a timely manner, even though the restaurant as quite busy.  The only thing they forgot was my toast, not a big deal.  Overall, great family restaurant!"}
{"text":"Sooo overpriced for the tiny portions you get. Go to Yours Truly for breakfast."}
{"text":"Okay, it is Bob Evans so it should be consistent quality. Unfortunately not this time. I stopped at 5 pm on a Thursday to pick up a Broasted Chicken dinner which I've had many times at other locations. I think I got chicken and rolls that had been sitting since lunch time as the chicken was dry and tough. I've never had a bad roll from Bob Evans but tonight, rolls were dry and edges were hard. High point of my meal was the broccoli. 
Staff was friendly and my meal was ready quickly- maybe because it was leftover from lunch?
On my receipt was info for a survey which I completed. Received an email offering a coupon towards next visit. I think next time, I'll go to the Bob Evans near 77."}
{"text":"It's just like Dennys or Village Inn. Actually, Village Inn is a little better in my opinion. The soup was good and so was the omelette that I had, but it was just meh. It's good for a quick \"diner style\" eat, but nothing super tasty."}
{"text":"Bob Evans is a solid no nonsense breakfast  .  If you don't mine a few bucks more than a mom and pop than this is your place .  Good coffee, food quality is average and service is always good.   Nothing to wow you but no issues."}
{"text":"It is hard to believe that a business based on breakfast service and multiple history in Ohio cannot even get eggs and bacon done properly the place cannot be any dirtier one waitress even proclaimed that table 71 had found hair in both of their plates this place and this chain have lost their way and there is no chance that breakfast is worth $11 when you can't get it even right on the 2nd or 3rd attempt lack of trying nobody cares for policies all add up to Doom"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews.  It has been a rare condition where I feel the situation warrants it.  This one left me upset enough to write.

We have had a Mother's Day tradition of going here for breakfast for years.  This year they refused to seat us unless we split up the group.  They didn't say we would have to wait a while they flat out refused us.  It's not like it was a group of 20.  There are 8 of us with 3 being small children.  It is a shame that they have decided to turn away loyal customers.  One of their competitors had us seated within 5 minutes of our arrival."}
{"text":"I always have a good meal at Bob Evans, and this location is on point.  Ordered the \"Bob Evans Burger\" with fries and wasn't disappointed.  The burger was cooked just right and the fried egg on top was perfectly over easy. The \"Border Scrambler\" is also a good choice when you are in the mood for breakfast food. The joint was clean, staff very friendly, and a good vibe among everyone.  I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Updated review: The last time I was there, I had amazing service. So I feel obligated to update my review. The food was good. Service was quick and friendly.

I mentioned to the waitress that she provided the best service I have had there in a while. She said there was a new manager who made a lot of changes to staff. 

I love my broasted chicken so I pop in every once in a while. I'm glad that now my trips will now include better service."}
{"text":"Typical Bob Evans, like other locations.  They were busy, we were with a large tour group.  I got the baked cod and broccoli and carrots since I'm trying to eat healthy, and it was good.  I know that they have lots of other tasty food that I no longer can eat because I'm eating to be healthy and fight cancer and diabetes now.  My friends who are also healthy eaters got salads with fat free dressing and no croutons and no cheese.

Service was OK, I had to ask for a drink refill."}
{"text":"A case study in systemic failure. It was obvious that systems did not function in a manor that allowed for efficient and effective delivery to Sunday breakfast crowds. A clear division between kitchen and wait staff was evident - as we sat at the bar and witnessed this first hand. This rift was clearly driven by the manager on duty who we listened to loudly bark orders at staff throughout our 20 minute wait for food. Mam, this failure is clearly on you and the management team of this location."}
{"text":"The best thing this Bob Evans has going for it is that it is right next to the hotel, and even in the rain we could walk there. After a long day of driving, that was as much as I was up for, but I wished I'd taken more time to find a better place to eat.

To be fair, my girlfriend enjoyed her turkey dinner, but my meal was forgettable even as it was edible. I ate my fill, so there was that.

It's not that anything is *bad* it's just nothing I've ever had at any Bob Evans has been very good. 

However, the menu has a wide range of choices, the breakfasts might be ok, it is close to the hotel, and the service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I have waited long time in front of the Carry Out counter.  The person came out because someone called him about a customer is ready to pay for his bill in ANOTHER line.  Then, the Bob Evans person came over to Carry Out counter where I waited for long time and helped that customer for the bill.  I asked \"am I in the right line for Carry Out?\" and he replied \"yes, I will serve you AFTER this customer\".  For about 30 seconds while he process the credit card payment for that customer from another line, he said \"it takes 30 minutes for Carry Out orders\".  Then I asked again \"is that really?\" and he replied \"yes\" without smile.  At that moment, after I have waited for time in front of thr Carry Out counter, I felt he does not want to serve me and gave me such reason to turn me down. So I left there without order anything."}
{"text":"After not feeling well, I decided to place a take out order at Bob Evans for lunch. Usually the chicken noodle soup is really good, but this time it was just okay. I got rolls instead of the cherry bread I ordered and my salad was a lot smaller than what I had expected. 
I usually have good experiences at Bob Evans, but this take out order did not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Friday night with family, this was the perfect option. Great service, good food, and it didn't break our bank. I really the home style setting plus there are so many options to choose from. I love the chicken noodle soup with the really big noodles, plus the salad was actually really good too. My mom loves the blueberry pancakes which are super fluffy. You know you can count on this place to satisfy your cravings :)"}
{"text":"I go here for breakfast only, FYI

Like this Bob Evans the best out of North Olmsted and Westlake. Service is always good to us. I usually get the Rise and Shine or Farmers choice, I think...Good food, get my eggs scrambled with cheese and chrispy bacon. It's fast that's for sure!

Sign up for their emails, you get coupons!"}
{"text":"We went here with the group. It took a while to get our food. This restaurant is more of a basic Perkins.Their biscuits were just OK. They sound better than they taste. The gravy with sausage she was really salty. The pancakes were OK but I had no trouble stopping. The hashbrowns were not crispy like they're supposed to be, but they were cooked only to be thawed. If you absolutely need a breakfast place and go here. But even then I might get a breakfast sandwich at McDonald's instead."}
{"text":"Wow has this place gone down hill. The smell of nasty body odor,filthy carpets, an employee sweeping the carpets as we're eating and spraying debris all over and when we asked her to stop, the look she gave us like we dropped n bombs at her. And the food  the b roasted chicken looked like it was cooked 12 hours earlier and the pot roast.....it used to be so good this was laying in what tasted like freezer burned water. Like it was defrosted and heated in the microwave in the same bowl. Wow and about 30.00 plus tip"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch because we wanted omelets.  Not many people there, but lots of dirty tables that needed bussed.  We waited way too long to be seated.  Then we waited way too long for coffee.  Then we waited way too long for pricey, mediocre food.  See the pattern."}
{"text":"I usually love Bob Evans but I won't go back to the Lakewood site again. Ordered fish, mac n cheese and coleslaw and it came one item at a time and service was slow.  Perhaps the waiter was new but my son was finished with his meal when I finally got my mac n cheese"}
{"text":"Miguel and I went there on the final day of my trip for breakfast.  I wanted Oatmeal b/c I was sick of eating chicken at Fridays where we had gone 4 times in the 2 previous days.  They were out of oatmeal.  I was bummed.  I had a salad which was just o.k. and Miguel had some really runny eggs.  The meal was more expensive than the Friday's happy hours and you get less food and the quality was not as good.  The same salad at Fridays was better."}
{"text":"I had a sweet waitress (Sarah?), very friendly and attentive. I had a Belgian Waffle with sausage. There's nothing really wrong with their food, it's just not very flavorful. Kind of like the bland food you'd get in a senior citizen complex. Restaurant was very clean. Handicapped parking very close to front door."}
{"text":"The service was just rotten here on Thanksgiving day. I was looking forward to dining here because it's one of my favs that we don't have back home in VA. So look, I get it, it's Thanksgiving day-but come on! Make the best of a bad situation- am I right? Anyway, the turkey was good.. The sides were good.. Even the pumpkin pie was good. We were all a bit irritated when the waitress served us black steamed broccoli though-which none of us ate obviously. Aside from the service and the one weird side dish it was OK. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The slowest service imaginable. Plus, if you ask for anything well done or not so well done they can never ever get it right. And it seems to be very poorly managed and I put other customers at the counter when I'm sitting there at the same complaints that I do."}
{"text":"So I decided to order my favorite breakfast meal online & noticed that it was no longer on the menu. Cream cheese filled crepes with blueberry topping! This was the only reason I drove out of my way to get this meal & put up with the manager's disinterested attitude. In the past he had taken the side of his rude employee who forgot to include my eggs with my breakfast. Needless to say, I'm really bummed out & surprised the crepes were discontinued. Oh well...guess that's it for me then."}
{"text":"An Ohio original.  I miss the \"down on the farm\" homestyle cooking at its best when I am in my new home out west.  Bob Evan's has a great menu with great taste and for me many many family memories coming here on Sunday mornings for good food."}
{"text":"What is the point in ordering ahead? Called, placed the order, pulled up to the \"Curbside Carry Out\" Call Upon Arrival .... I make he call, and the guy answers the phone - actually laughs and says you'll have to wait another 15-20 minutes before I'm coming out there ...you 7 orders ahead of you. Seriously?????"}
{"text":"Worst bob Evans I've been to. Slow service, regardless of how busy they are. Carry out is usually 10 minutes behind, even waiting on something like a salad. Staff is more concerned with breaks than helping customers and manager doesn't seem to know how to manage. Food is your standard bob Evans but it suffers because it all sits in the window for 15 minutes"}
{"text":"For a quick bite or an easy casual meal, Bob Evans is the perfect 3 1/2 star stop. Good soups and lots of comfort food. This location has friendly quick service which is great being so near the Cleveland airport. Add some extra time to your travel schedule and stop here before heading to the airport where all that you'll find is overpriced underwhelming food."}
{"text":"The overall experience is what you might expect from a chain restaurant. Nothing stood out as above and beyond from the service to the food.

The server was polite and checked in occasionally to refresh my coffee. It would have been nice to be served a glass of water. 

The food was alright. I thought everything could have been served hotter. The restaurant was not busy on a Friday morning when I visited at 9am and my food was lukewarm. The portion of home fries seemed small."}
{"text":"I use to get to go here all the time but their quality and service the last few times was HORRIBLE.  The last time I didn't even get the correct order but the manager could not be bothered to talk to me or call me back when I called to complain.  

Decided to give them one more try.  30 min wait after being told 5 - 10 min max.  After the long wait I got home and my order was wrong.  I am officially done with Bob Evans Westlake.  Needs new management !!!!"}
{"text":"1st time coming here. 
6pm Tuesday evening.
A few tables w/people in the back, a few dirty tables in front.   
Manager kept looking at us as he's taking food out of the window for server.  Even when no food coming out, he just stood there, not even acknowledging us.   
10-15 minutes later, he tells one of the servers to go sit people.  She walks away from him, goes to a dirty table, picks up one tiny straw wrapper, comes back (walking with a dazed look like she's in the twilight zone not sure what she's doing) , throws paper away, ignores that he told her to sit people and goes to help a lady who just walked in, I'm assuming for a to go order, like I thought the  others sitting there were waiting for.  Then I couldn't take another minute and I blurted out 'um, we've been here waiting'... She responds by waving her hand at the other few people sitting on a bench saying they are waiting to be sat first.  My eyes popped out and I said, 'your kidding me.' I waved good bye and said see ya.  She didn't even do what her manager told her to do, she was continuing to help lady that just walked in.   I took a pic before we left to show how NOT busy it was and there is no reason why 3 groups of people should have been waiting... And who knows how long before I got there that the others were waiting!! Horrible management!!!"}
{"text":"I am done with this Bob Evans! We just tried it again yesterday, and that was the last time!
People waiting in line to get seated at around 5pm, but not because it is so busy, but because that young lady in charge is just not into her job, walking as slow as an old woman and makes a face like she is pissed that she has to work. 
Sitting at the table with about 5 tables occupied in that area, we are waiting for at least getting menus and drinks, nothing! Waitress is in training, ok, I get that has to be done, but both girls are as slow as it comes. The manager finally brings us menus and takes the drink order. Waitresses show up to take the order. Drinks are served by the manager. It takes good 20 minutes to get our dinner, still no more than 5 tables occupied.
We are getting the check only after asking several times.
At checkout there is only one register open, the girl who is supposed to check us out is on the phone and does not even look up. They also have removed the device to swipe your credit or gift card, which made it much easier to check out.
The food was so-so. My herb chicken was just barely done, still almost pink, a very small amount of mashed potatoes. 
My husband's turkey was ok, but not excellent.
Bob Evans, you can do better!"}
{"text":"My family and I used to get Bob Evans take out from this location very often but every single time, They always forget to give me something. From dressing, to sides, to bread. I just don't understand why it is so difficult to receive every item I've paid for? Especially paying extremely high prices for just ok food. I get everyone makes mistakes but every single time?"}
{"text":"If, like us, you're staying at La Quinta next door, it's hard to beat Bob Evans for convenience. Frankly the area surrounding the hotel is light on dining options, unless you feel a desperate need for another Primanti's sandwich or you only eat fast food.

The food is basic Americana, but properly prepared, with ample portions and good quality take out packaging. And the prices are cheap. We were happy."}
{"text":"I ordered a couple entrees online. Said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I showed up 25 minutes later, paid for the food and waited 35 minutes for my food. WTH? A couple salads with some chicken doesn't take a hour to make."}
{"text":"Nice relaxing breakfast with friends for New Year's Eve 

Service was slow but food was ok"}
{"text":"Food is always consistently good

The staff is friendly, but not consistently good at their job. 

Good coffee 

Managers seem to care"}
{"text":"Take out order. Took an hour to make it. Food was freezing. They forgot gravy. No condiments or anything. Eggs were raw. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Yesterday we stopped at this Bob Evans for lunch. The experience was awful! From the moment we sat down it was evident that the waitress was stressed and unhappy. This problem was further exacerbated when she was given a party of twelve a few minutes later. Service was slow and drinks never were refilled. The table behind us arrived after us and was served promptly and efficiently by a different waitress. When our food arrived our breakfast included burnt toast and under cooked eggs. The lunch had burnt chicken and undercooked broccoli. When this was brought to the attention of the waitress and manager they became immediately defensive blaming the party of twelve. Another twenty minutes later a different breakfast was finally brought out. What should have been a relaxing lunch became a tense, miserable, hour and a half mess. An apology from anyone (waitress, manager, someone) would have gone a long way to improving our satisfaction and likeliness of returning but there was never any acknowledgement. 
It's understandable that people have bad days but is a simple apology too much to ask for?"}
{"text":"Is it a gourmet, thinking out of the box sort of breakfast?  No.  But is it pretty darn tasty, consistent and traditional? Yes.  You go here and you know what you're going to get; this isn't rocket science.  There is just something about their breakfasts, especially their biscuits.  I pretty much always get the \"Rise and Shine\".  Two eggs how you like them (I recommend scrambled with cheese, yum!), potatoes (get the hash browns), your choice of breakfast meat, and biscuits or toast.  Their coffee is a little strong, but not anywhere near as strong as some other well known Seattle coffee establishments that rhyme with Martrucks.  The biscuits are light, and tasty and oh-so-good dipped in honey.  I think I started drooling.  The servers are down to earth, and they have had many familiar faces for several years.  This restaurant has been recently renovated and has a clean family farm feel to it.  I come back again and again for their tasty breakfasts and will be back again soon I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Good customer service in the morning. The staff was very friendly even though my eggs were cooked wrong. They remedied it in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"Decent food and a good waiting staff. I had a decent experience here. No complaints really."}
{"text":"Yikes!  Where to begin...  Went here for breakfast a few weeks ago at my dad's suggestion because they are pretty set in their ways being locals of North Huntingdon and all.  Two weeks ago we were promptly seated however, it took almost 12 minutes to be greeted by our server.  And it really wasn't that busy, so being in the business, right away I could see problems everywhere.  After we ordered I could tell our server was an un-trained and, had far too may tables in her section than she was capable of handling.  Our breakfast took at least 20 minutes and sat up in the window for another 10 before the server even realized it was there.  It was satisfactory however, I sucked down my diet soda in 5 minutes and was never again asked for a refill the entire time.  I swore I'd never go back until last week my mother said, \"I found a GOGO coupon for Bob Evans!\"  So I decided to give it another try...  Today BE was busy enough and the same result.  My dad and I waited ten minutes before the manager finally ran out and gave us our menus and took our drink order.  She was flying around like she was on some type of super meth and right there we should have left.  I blame myself for ordering steak and eggs.  Not being my first rodeo, I already knew the result just from seeing the front of house chaos.  Typically when I see this, I stick to scrambled eggs.  But I wanted some beef and when the timely breakfast came out I was very surprised.  The steak looked good and seared very well.  I mean, I'm not expecting much from a 10 dollar steak, as long as it's not bloody raw, I can just about deal with anything.  I ordered medium and when I cut into it, it was raw.  there is a difference between red and cooked to temp and gnarly red that looks like something you during a slaughter on the Nat GEO channel.  This was really bad.  I requested a cook-up and the frantic manager took it back and instructed the cook to place it back on the grill \" a little longer.\"  It came back out 90 second later and was still completely raw, but just seared over again where I had originally cut it.   The manager was beyond rattled and tried to compensate, but my stomach was already turning from the sight of that bloody, un prepared beef.  It even ran onto the eggs and potatoes which I ate with my spoon cause I feared cross contamination from cutting the steak.  The manager again tried to take it back and cook it up, but by that time I was over the Bobby Evans experiment.  I have been in the food business for 13 years and that is one of those experiences that will ruin your appetite for beef forever.  It was simply unacceptable.  The manger was nice enough to take 4.50 off my check.  Then as we were leaving, another server gave us the original ticket with the full price.  They have major problems here they need to address.  Total lack of ownership from top to bottom; training, scheduling, ticket and seat times, quality checks in kitchen.  Bad, very bad."}
{"text":"The night before my flight home, I ordered a takeout dinner from Bob Evans. Seeking comfort food on a 38 degree, rainy night, I ordered fresh roasted turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes and gravy, and green beans with ham. The order came with cranberry sauce and two bisquits. 
Everything was hot and packed to go on my arrival. Delish, and was just the comfort food I was looking for."}
{"text":"This Bob Evans is hit or miss, but more often a miss.  I usually get breakfast items here, especially the pancakes.  Sometimes they can be fluffy and quite tasty, but more often they are rather hard and lacking in flavor, or undercooked.  Nonetheless, the other options in the area for breakfast aren't that much better, with the exception of Panera."}
{"text":"Seated w/in two minutes. Waited 15 before a waitress 'noticed' us. Food came quickly, and was good (steak was delish). Waited again for take-out boxes and check."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at this location. I requested gluten free options for which they provided a gluten free menu. I ordered an item that was not typically gluten free. The manager then came to my table to be sure I wanted a non gluten free item. He then gave me an alternative. 

I really appreciated his double checking. They care about their customers."}
{"text":"Bob Evans delivered on Mother's Day. Excellent service. Good food.  Our server Vicky was attentive, and continually kept the coffee flowing. Our breakfast orders were taken and served promptly. The food was tasty.  We were very pleased with our visit.  Nice job Bob Evans!"}
{"text":"We had good food but terrible service. By the way, this was like 6pm and not terribly busy.

1. We waited a good 15-20 minutes for the basics (water, silverware).

2. We had to flag down our server because she forgot to bring my mom her soup. She was chatting with a nearby table. By the time her soup was delivered, the rest of our meal came at the same time. The shift manager came to our table to apologize and admitted the service was unacceptable. We learned that they only had 2 servers.

3. At the end of the meal, my mom was suppose to get her caramel sundae, I wanted a refill on iced tea, and 2 take out boxes for our bread. I had to go find the same manager and mentioned we had been waiting another small eternity for dessert, tea, and boxes.

4. The manager offered to comp our bill but never followed through. Nice offer but that was a letdown.

On the plus side, I did enjoy my chicken cobb salad and lemonade bread!

Overall, I've never had this bad of service at Bob Evans. Perhaps this was a rare incident..."}
{"text":"I was so excited to stop here since all of them near Chicago city limits are closed. Boy oh boy did that joy end quickly!!!!

Ordered a full order of biscuits & gravy, the meal came fairly quickly. It was hot as well. My 1st indication of an issue were the hard ass biscuits he brought me. 

I looked at my spoon that laid next to my biscuits & saw a spoon that was dirty & had old gravy on it from another table. 

I WAS COMPLETELY GROSSED OUT!!!

Then my apple juice had something floating in it.. 

Gravy was good & workers were nice."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love waking up with plans to go to Bob Evans? Wake up, get dressed enough so you don't get cited for indecency and head down to Bob's. Their breakfast is to die for or it'll kill you.
Nothing healthful if you want their regular stuff. The homestead breakfast is what I usually get and can't finish. Comes with meat (links or patties or bacon or ham) two eggs, home fries or hash brown, 2 biscuits and sausage gravy. STUFF!!!!! you up for the rest of the day if you finish everything on your plate. STUFF if you finish half of what's on your plate. They have a decent kids menu too and I must say my kids made me proud when the ordered the fruit and yogurt plate. I, myself, was not well behaved. I've been ordering their country friend steak. Yummy! Delicious piece of beef fried with a nice batter topped with breakfast gravy. How can I not gain any weigh?
Service is usually good. attentive and intuitive. So remember to tip well. 

I do have a sour note though. Their coffee is ....... weak. Weak, like, dude wearing leg warmer, weak. Weak, like it rains everyday I'm off, weak. Seriously, weak (PG version). Please PM for director's cut of this review."}
{"text":"Got carry out and ordered Farmers Choice breakfast. I requested cinnamon supreme hotcakes along with my scrambled eggs and bacon. Initially the cashier acted dumbfounded (I get this all the time at other locations) then she told me she could 'add' the components to the hotcakes (are you sure?) and I certainly was up charged as well. Once my order came out I had to send the over easy eggs back which lent a bit of distraction to everything else. After my order was finally completed, I got home to hotcakes that BARELY had any cream cheese; which is the whole draw to the dish. Won't come to this location again for lack of attention to detail let alone the average two star rating that I should have paid attention to. Good chain: lackluster service this time and location."}
{"text":"There Turkey dinner was delicious! So your probably wondering why I only gave them 3 stars???  Well, I also had their chicken soup which was not tastefully at all and lastly the service was lacking . After receiving my meal I was never asked if I wanted a refill or if my food was fine. The only contact that I had with my waitress was literally when I orders my food and when I received my bill. They we're also not very busy so I am ensure why the service was so poor."}
{"text":"Well, it's a Bob Evans.

The decor inside is nice, and this location has defined to me what I should expect out of a Bob Evans (or by extension, any breakfast place). Service is quick and friendly.

I have had better service at this Bob Evans than the one in Macedonia, so I would recommend making the trip to Twinsburg for this."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Waitress named Margie, super rude and it's just not needed. We came here to eat good and enjoy family, and all we did was be less than pleased with the service and felt disgusted the whole time. I love this food chain and I've been to a few different ones, but this visit was by far the worst experience at a Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Wow. Worse BE experience ever. Came here for a quick, in and out breakfast. First, at 10:30 am there is a 25 minute wait with several tables open and plenty of wait staff (Yes, I do know what I am talking about). They took our order pretty fast, she is really trying, but no placemats or silverware, non clean. Table next to us is eating with plastic utensils. Two managers in site but I'm not seeing either being much help. Seems like a lot of wasted motion, and lots of coffee refilling. Almost an hour since we walked in food is here. No silverware yet. Yikes. Food is typical Bob Evans. Visited the restroom on the way out and made me think of vacations in developing countries: dirty, gross, streaks of who knows what in all surfaces. Not sure when the floors, baseboards or metal surfaces were cleaned last. Disgusting, not to even think about how unsanitary. Bob Evans should be better than this."}
{"text":"How is this place empty?  Seriously, the food is good the prices are good if not comparable to most places. If you don't want to wait in line this is the place. This place was empty @ 5:30 and, based on the food, it should be full. I highly recommend giving it a shot."}
{"text":"Supporting a home-state business. God bless Mr. Evans and all his charitable causes! The country fried steak n eggs rockes, as usual!"}
{"text":"Ssslllooowww service, from the nearly ten minute wait at the hostess stand to the five minutes waiting at the table for our waitress to take our order to another ten minutes to pay the check. The only thing that wasn't slow was the food - once we placed our order, it was brought out very quickly.

The food was good. Consistent with my Bob Evans experience. Hot, plenty of it and flavorful. I like their turkey dinner, which comes with a good size portion of turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes. Maybe not enough cranberry, but I love good cranberry sauce. Sausage gravy (my wife was in a breakfast mood) had a good amount sausage in it.

Perhaps they were just having an off night."}
{"text":"Would give no stars if possible. I unexpectedly had a sunday off work, so my fiance and i decided to go to breakfast. Tried a few places that all had long waits so we finally settled on bob evans. Biggest mistake ever. They also had a wait but we stayed. After about 20 minutes we were seated, and the hostess took the tip off our table that the previous customers had left. Then we waited. And waited. Several people passed by but no one acknowledged us. After waiting at least ten minutes, i grabbed the assistant manager that was walking by. She got our drink order. Still no server came by. The manager returned with our drinks and took our order. After about another 10 or 15 minutes, an older female with short hair came over and said \"someone took your order right?\" We said yes, and that was the last we saw of anyone. The server never came back to refill waters or coffee, or to tell us sorry food was taking so long or anything. Assistant manager also never returned, although i did see her working in kitchen. Meanwhile, tables were getting sat around us, ordering, receiving pleasant greetings as well as their food, and even getting boxes. One table that was sat next to us, an older female, also had a tip left from previous customer but this time the host just moved it to the side instead of picking it up. This made my fiance of color and i feel that she was afraid we would have taken the money on our table, but this woman would not. That irritated both of us while we continued to sit and wait. After 25 minutes, i was pretty sure i saw my meal in the kitchen window. Then his. And still we sat and waited. After 40 minutes, we had to leave because he had to get to work. We noticed as we walked past the kitchen window on our way out that it was exactly what we ordered just sitting there. Waiting would not have bothered us if we had any acknowledgment from anyone other than the 2 short interactions. We sat at the table for an hour total and were only acknowledged twice. Unbelievable. And after all that, they were eventually going to try and serve us cold food."}
{"text":"Good food but prices are high for a Bob Evans. They've repeatedly messed up online orders which is disappointing. Staff is nice but in a small crowded parking area. Very convenient location. It's right at highland rd and route 8"}
{"text":"I had the worst restaurant experience in a while at this location. First, the waitress spilled coffee on me. Then, multiple people at my table ordered water that never came. Our party of 10 was there for over an hour before our food came. I get that we are a large party and should be patient, but two parties of at least 6 people ate their food and left before we got our food (and they came in well after us.) Our waitress was forgetful and did not come to the table to give us status updates on our wait. She was slow and neglectful on refills and forgot parts of people's orders. I have a 7 week old child with me who was getting fussy because of how long we were there. We went at 10am on a Monday, not a busy time. Completely dissatisfied with the experience and will not be returning to the Mentor, OH location the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"This has to be the friendliest Bob Evans I've been to in a very long time. From the time I walked in the door we were greeted warmly, or were they flirting with us? Anyhoo, they made us feel welcome after a long road trip. The food was excellent, I had the breakfast. The facility is immaculate, and the environment matches as well. This Bob Evans is a hidden gem in this little town."}
{"text":"Traveling through and love Bob Evans. Seated promptly and our server, Brandie, was amazing. Super friendly and courteous, really made our dining experience fun. Great food as well.  Thank you Brandie for making this so enjoyable."}
{"text":"I waited 40 minutes for a pancake and sausage and biscuit order. Then, they had the bathroom supplies sitting on the counter with the food! The bin they put on the floor in the bathroom! They told me 20 minutes to pick up. I waited 40 minutes. No one apologized, no one said thank you for waiting. It was completely disorganized. To top that, they didn't even give me the right food. I will never come here again, especially after seeing the toilet cleaner on the food counter."}
{"text":"Seriously, if I could give it 0 stars I would.

First off, the lettuce in the salad was rank. It was old and had the reddish-nasty color to it. I'll probably end up with E. Coli or something after the 4 bites I had.

Next, Steak was sent back 3 times. THREE. Once because it wasn't right at all. Second time, it was over cooked. Third time was over cooked again. I ended up canceling my order completely. I will never, ever go back. Ever.

Service was terrible too. Terrible. The TWO servers we had seemed totally dazed and confused. 

Again, I will never go back. Thanks Bob Evans for ruining my appetite."}
{"text":"I get oatmeal, so my review might not be worth a hill of beans.

However, the oatmeal was good!

Service was very good and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Great service, clean, and good food. Their Bacon is greatness.  They have some wacky breakfast bowls and such, but I stick with the classic breakfast."}
{"text":"Always terrific service. Oatmeal is the best around. Typical chain food menu, but breakfast stands out. Typically over busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"I always liked Bob Evans, we always went during breakfast. Everything I had on the breakfast menu i liked most recent time I went was about a week ago, this time for dinner. My wife and me went around 7:30pm. It wasn't busy, we got seated right away. Are waitress was very friendly and up beat. Me and my wife  both order hot tea, we got hot water with a small basket with a variety of Twinings teas inside. Twinings is a good brand so we were happy about that. My wife ordered Meatloaf I ordered chicken pot pie with a salad for a side. The Salad was very good and I am not much of a salad person. My wife loved her meatloaf and I loved the chicken pot pie. It was very filling,, nice and hot, and the chicken and vegetables tasted fresh. We were able to pay for all that with our 25 dollar gift card. So the price was pretty. I would like to come here again soon."}
{"text":"Honestly, I haven't had worst service ever! Waited for a table for 10 minutes and their were tables open and clean everywhere. Water came to the table with coffee grounds in it. Our server, Lisa, was no where to to be found after taking our order. A different person delieverd our food and we had to ask the \"retail leader\" for our check. He printed and delivered it and we were on our way out the door to never return. We normally go to Brookpark rd. and everything is usually fine. This one was not fine. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Bob Evans is a good fall back for breakfast for me.  A solid menu with a few twists and reasonably priced, I go here when I just cannot make up my mind on a place on the weekends up in the Cornburbs.

Never an empty parking lot, it has some nice wait staff that are always working hard to serve you or make you laugh.....they do work for the tips.....I've been told some folks have worked there a while, so they act like this is their job....not just a stop off to somewhere else.

Right off the highway, this is a good place to check out if you are looking for good food at a good price."}
{"text":"First chicken meal turned back way over done.  The replacement dinner was raw inside. Thank goodness we caught it before  it was eaten. Guess they just don't know how to cook chicken at Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Warning do not patronize this restaurant. What I saw last night turned my stomach. I paid for a take out meal and the manager on duty checked me out. Before packing my food in the bag he removed his gloves revealing hands that were indescribably grotesque. They were covered in boils and had strips of flesh hanging from them. 

I threw the food away as soon as I got home.  Who ever the genius was at Bob Evans who thought having this disgusting health hazard handling food should be fired. I plan on contacting the county health department to lodge a formal complaint."}
{"text":"Can the service be any slower?  I think 40 min for 1 egg and potatoes is enough time."}
{"text":"I never heard of this restaurant before last week lol. I'm from NYC and I don't believe there are any there. I was invited out to breakfast so of course I went because who turns down breakfast?! The restaurant was easy to get to and there was plenty of parking. If you know my you knows that's a huge plus! I wasn't sure what exactly was going to be on the menu and I was pleased to see a pretty decent variety. I was torn between pancakes and French toast but in the end I chose the blueberry French toast brioche. I probably totally butchered the name but I'm a nutshell it was French toast with blueberries and blueberry sauce. I also opted for the sausage patties on the side. They even serve the drinks in mason jars which gives it such a southern feel. Last but not least the customer service was great. Very pleasant people. Nice and inviting from the beginning to the end. Safe to say I'd make this a regular spot like Ihop ( is it even called that anymore) or Waffle House. I'll be back"}
{"text":"We arrived at 11:05 for the Special of Farmers Choice Breakfast. As of 11:58 our waiter Jordan has still not delivered our breakfast.  Complained to manager. 
Awful waiter awful service!!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant addition to Broadview Heights. I especially enjoy the high quality take-out option for me and my husband. Delicious food and lots of it for your $. Beats fast food always! The staff is very kind and helpful. I recommend the slow roasted pot roast over mashed potatoes - wonderful, delicious and satisfying comfort food!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my husband on my dinner break from work the other day. I was worried I might not get in and out in an hour based on some co-workers past experiences but was willing to take the gamble. I'm very glad I did!

The place was not crowded at all for a Friday at 5:00. It had been remodeled since we were last there and looked great. We were seated and served immediately. The server was pleasant and attentive. We gave him our orders and got them in a timely manner. I got a strawberry salad with grilled chicken and a warm bacon dressing that was THE BOMB! My husband got a traditional sliced turkey, stuffing and mashed potato plate with green beans that he said was really good. We also got an order of onion petals with a dipping sauce that puts all other restaurants to shame. 

We were talking about our meal the next day, it was that delicious. I guess we were so used to Bob Evans for breakfast that we forgot how good they were with their other meals, too. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to have service.  I've witnessed an employee ask if she could help bus tables, a manager said no we're fine. 
We've not had a drink for 15 minutes,  and are still waiting for food.  I understand it's busy, but there are 9 people standing at the counter, appears to be 5 people in the back and no one checking on anyone's drinks. It was better when they left the carafe of coffee, but they don't do that anymore so they can interact more with customers.  That's crap. 
Hope the food is at least warm...
Food was cold,  but I can't hive 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"What I hate, they have weak coffee and the eggs are runny. But the food is always hot  and the wait staff is always nice. Its the same from city to city the food and the service."}
{"text":"One of the worst waitresses I've ever had.  Ask her if I could get get mixture of rolls and bread for my dinner. Since I picked the extra value meal  ($2 extra)it says endless bread on menu. The waitress said they don't do that. And rolled her eyes.  Won't be back here. Food was cold also.  She kind of tossed the food on the table.  Needs to go back to waitress school"}
{"text":"On the way out of Pittsburgh headed towards home - I got off the Interstate to snag some breakfast - saw the Bob Evans logo on the Interstate signs for \"food\" at this exit.

Was seated immediately and courteously greeted by a young man who was my server.

Scanned the menu for breakfast items - which of course - at a Bob Evans - there are a lot of 'em!

Decided on a biscuits and gravy with eggs offering - one biscuit with gravy, chopped sausage on the side, and breakfast potatoes. With one egg on top. And got a cup of coffee.

Food came out very quickly. The breakfast potatoes consisted of small perfectly cooked chunks of potato - a little over salted IMHO - but decent. The rest of the meal was tasty, although I think they were being a tad skimpy with the gravy - I want enough to totally saturate the biscuit.

Service was excellent. Breakfast was $8.93 not counting tip."}
{"text":"Order online thinking it'll be faster and more convenient so when I get there it's ready. ... guess again, I still had to wait 20 minutes. Not happy consisting the place only had a few customers.  I also had to wait a couple mins for a drink carrier.  Bob Evans really need to get their sh*t in order or I WILL NOT be going back"}
{"text":"The menu looks the same but the portions are smaller and the quality has dropped.  Breakfast should have been easy but the sausage patty was dry.  My fried chicken breasts were about 1/4\" thick."}
{"text":"First of all it took 15 minutes just to get our drinks and then when we got our food another 30 minutes later her food was lukewarm and then another 25 minutes when she gave us the check or Sundays were melted you best better believe we will not be back"}
{"text":"We sat down at 11:30 this morning and was not served until 12:45.  I ordered chicken and waffles because of the praline sauce.  She brought the chicken and waffles cold with no praline sauce.  My mother ordered pancakes and they did not have sugar free syrup (she's diabetic). The food was lukewarm and the manager tried to joke her way through the situation.  Really disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I went there last Sunday for breakfast.  The place was busy but there were some 6 empty tables, the manager took my name and made us wait for 10 minutes. Some of the empty tables were dirty, and some were clean ready to be used why he didn't sat us on one of them? Idk there were like 40 people working and the place was a mess i ordered the blueberry pancakes with sausage i got the pancakes 10 minutes later and the sausage 25 minutes after.  This place is a mess very unorganized, nobody came to check on us or offered an apology, so i dont think im going back again i rather go to ihop on avon lake."}
{"text":"5/20/16
I've seen Bob Evans products in our grocery stores but had never seen or been to a restaurant location.  We decided to try it for breakfast.
The restaurant itself was clean and very roomy.  It had a really comfortable feeling.  We were seated right away and our server was very friendly and attentive.  My husband's coffee was always full and she checked on us frequently.
I really wanted a big ol' plate of French toast with some protein but the only thing on the menu that I found close to that came with only one slice of French toast with eggs and sausage or bacon so I chose that.  The eggs were really, really bland.  No salt whatsoever.  I also didn't care for the sausage.  I'm used to having Johnsonville at home (and whatever Perkins serves).  This just seemed like there was some spice or something missing.  
The French toast was fantastic.  I should have stuck with the big plate of toast and just ordered some protein a la carte.  
My husband enjoyed the omelet he ordered and my son had already eaten at the hotel but he mowed down a plate of French fries and seemed quite content.  
I'd definitely come back and try something else if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Our first time in this location. Everything...just ok. Food...same. Service pretty slow overall. Food quality...just ok. Not planning to return."}
{"text":"Yes, the restaurant has only been open a couple of months but basic service is basic service. 
Customers shouldn't have to ask for water refills or silverware.

The food was fine...it's Bob Evans. I think there's a standard Bob Evans seeks and I don't know that I've ever been dissatisfied...at least with the food.

We had a bonus tonight as it was Kids' Night and my two children would eat for free. Only there was a problem.

When I went to pay the bill the girl at the register first forgot to discount the kids' meals and had to call in reinforcements. Then they noticed only one kids' meal was on the bill. The other was entered as a normal meal...so all in all I saved $3.

On top of everything else, I ordered a chocolate sundae to go only to find out I received a caramel sundae."}
{"text":"Its a chain! When you are lame like me and live in a lame place like New England which doesn't have anything, you have to try these all american chains to see what they are all about.

Well, we did one snowy night! There was the nice smell of reefer wafting through the air, but we were hungry so along we went. Its kind of like a Bickfords with a much larger menu.

Really, they have everything. The food wasn't even that bad, I had seafood, a lot of it for about $10. Most of the menu items were priced around $5 which is super cheap.

Best memory besides the pot...It was the small family sitting near us. Pennsylvania big hair atop the mothers pulled back face lifted head. Their kid was running around and came back and said \"they yelled at me and told me to sit\" and then the waiter came over and the mother said to him \"I am still hungry\" Um what? 

Wow. Now that I know what Bob Evans is all about, I may not go back, just because we have Bickfids up heeya!"}
{"text":"Chain Store breakfast restaurant  -- the Monroeville store was getting ready to shut down for a facelift!  So we haven't been since they've done that.  
We went in Jan when it was snowy outside and we were hankering for some good old Bob Evans sausage, grits, eggs and biscuits.  It was VERY crowded!  I dislike sitting that close and hope that when they remodel that they take out a few tables so the back of your chair is not touching the one sitting behind you.  

Breakfast was hot and good.  

The people across from us were complaining from the time they sat down til the time we left about how poor the service was.  Um...we had the same waitress and she was very pleasant.  Some people....you can't please everyone. But shame on them.  Our gal had her hands full with her section -- Did I say it was crowded?  
Despite the crowded conditions, we have always liked Bob Evan's breakfast.  Not sure why anyone would order anything else on their menu.  
We will go back one weekend soon."}
{"text":"Never been to a Bob Evans so I was intrigued as I've heard good things. What a disappointment. The waitstaff did the best they could, but the hosts could care less if we were there. The food was surprisingly terrible considering it was the breakfast menu. I love cooked breakfast and have not been to a restaurant where it's bad. But this was the exception. Since I am visiting and know there's a location in my home state, I was willing to give them a second chance...until I was paying my bill. You don't have to be enthusiastic, but at least make me feel like you want me there and want me to come back. Never again."}
{"text":"On the contrary to popular belief, I love this place!! great tasty food and fast service. I recommend Josh as a waiter. He was fast and polite! Me and my family go often! :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for slow service, this is your kind of place. Order taken at 10:58...brought biscuits out at 11:20, said food would be right out...8 minutes later we were walking out the door hungry and heading to Athena's in Avon Lake.
WE WILL NOT BE BACK! Gave them many chances over the last year to get there crap together...epic FAIL!"}
{"text":"This was the only Bob Evans I've ever been to...and I've only been once (and won't likely be rushing back), so I can't give you a regular's point-of-view, but Bob Evans falls in line with any of the big restaurant chains serving up cheap, filthy foods to the masses. It's basically a Denny's, IHOP, Eat-n-Park alternative, and is on-par with those. The food was perfectly fine, but if you care about what you put into your body, stay far away from the nutrition info! Seriously, the ice cream scoop-size of butter that they served with my French toast was absurd. Is it humanly possible to use that much butter on three little pieces of bread?

I digress, though. If you're looking for a traditional, heavy breakfast, Bob Evans can fill that need. The staff at this location was nice, handling our friends' baby with the type of care that you'd expect from a family-focused eatery. The food came out quickly, and the quality was good for the price point, and we were out of there in no time, without ever feeling like we were being rushed along. We couldn't believe how cheap our meal was for a group of 4 adults, and for that price, it was easy to understand why the wait was out the door at lunch time. It's a great, low-cost option for families to go out for a meal."}
{"text":"Got seated. The waitress took about ten minutes to come get our drink orders. We ordered our food as well at the same time. She brought our drinks. My child got hot chocolate and she brought no napkins. I had to get up and ask for some. She then brought our food our and no silverware. I had to get up and ask for that as well. She never came back to check on us at all. I had to get up and ask for more syrup and refills. I finally asked for a manager. He did nothing. Our food was Luke warm and our service sucked. I basically waited my own table and the manager didn't even care. I will never go back to this location. GO TO SNOW ROAD IF YOU WANT GREAT SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the buttermilk biscuits, but other than that, the breakfast food is mediocre. I ordered the \"Garden Harvest\" omelet, which has baby spinach, diced tomatoes and onions with Monterrey-Jack cheese. It was topped with hollandaise sauce, shredded cheddar cheese and scallions. I also ordered the hashbrowns.
I thought there were too many tomatoes and onions in the omelet, as it was very wet and soggy. The onions were not really cooked (i.e. caramelized) , just heated so they were wet and white as the new fallen snow. The spinach portion was fine, but I'd halve the tomatoes and onion to dry it out. And caramelize the onion to get more moisture out. Not much cheese evident on the omelet, but that could have been due to the moisture. I also thought that there was no flavor in this omelet, even with the cheese and hollandaise sauce. Where I to make this, I'd use a bit of feta cheese instead to introduce flavor. The hash browns were okay. 
They also have a new \"Bold Roast\" coffee, which was foisted upon me. I don't take my coffee with cream or sugar, so I found it to be way to bitter to enjoy. Fortunately, my father ordered the regular and I was able to cut mine with his to get a reasonable strength coffee. I already have enough hair on my chest; I don't need extra strong coffee to promote the growth of anymore thank you very much :)
On the upside, the overworked server (not enough servers to cover the breakfast crowd at this location so she was running like a chicken with its head cutoff) was very friendly, positive, and treated us like family even though she was trying to handle a good dozen tables. I appreciate her effort :)"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service wasn't outstanding. I really was just upset that the server decided that it was time to give me the check just as our food was served. Wasn't even asked if everything was alright until we were getting ready to leave. I'd go back just for the multi-grain pancakes."}
{"text":"Came here one morning with bf because I was craving pancakes. Service was great and waitress was extremely friendly! The pancakes were perfect (I like mine a little cakey and dense.) Super clean inside too. Bf got country fried steak with gravy and extra crispy hash browns, and he said they were cooked perfectly. All in all, great experience if you're looking for a quick bite and speedy service!"}
{"text":"The eggs, pancakes and bacon were great ! The hash browns were a little undercooked though, I will try the home fries the next time I come. But my servers were great, very attentive."}
{"text":"Had dinner at bob Evans in Avon saturday. Started out good but things did go downhill quickly. While our waitress was good, you could tell she was new because we had to ask for almost everything and she forgot to ask what sides or bread we wanted with our dinners...lol.

There were a few things that happened that were not her fault:

One member of our party ordered a baked potato. The first one came out partially raw and the second one came out with spots on it that were spoiled. Did not attempt a 3rd one, ordered mac n cheese but took so long to get, asked for it to go.

Ordered mashed potatos with kids turkey lurkey dinner but got double broccoli. They did bring out potatos but were lumpy and cold.

Kids meals were brought out first and meals for adults did not come out until 20 minutes later

Cheddar potato soup was cold and lumpy."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for probably as long as this location has been open. It's not a fancy place, but the food is pretty good. It's as similar to home cooking by mom or grandma as a restaurant can get.

Breakfast is my favorite time to eat here. The sausage gravy is the best ever. There are many breakfast options and they are all great with large portions and great prices. 

Dinner options can be pretty awesome too. The turkey dinner and the meatloaf are great. I can remember getting these as takeout in college for something similar to home cooking.

For a simple, inexpensive meal this is great option."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Bob Evans has made a huge mistake. I used to enjoy these restaurants very much but they have gone to the mostly pre-prepared offerings with mixed acceptability on my part. Still acceptable but would be my last choice if a place to eat most of the time."}
{"text":"Pink pork and wet uncooked eggs. The manager's excuse was that the cook was new. If this was a one- time experience I wouldn't Yelp about it. This is my third bad meal here. I won't be back and suggest you skip it. There is a reason why there are no cars in the parking lot. They took the meal off my bill, but as I told the manager \"Bob Evans should be able to make sausage and eggs flawlessly.\"  Do yourself a favor, don't go here. Try the breakfast/deli place down the road."}
{"text":"I know this is Bob Evan's. I'd be comparing to the restaurants alike (e.g. Eat N' Park, Denny's etc.)  
I used to enjoy their breakfast. Their sausage is solid, the biscuits are great.  If I had to pick a chain restaurant to eat breakfast on the road, Bob Evan's was my go to.  But this location kind of ruined it for me. The worst service ever.  I was sat down immediately, but had to wait about 10min for a waitress to approach our table to see if we wanted a drink.  Food was cold by the time it showed up.  But i don't dare send any food back at a restaurant like this.  So I suffered through the cold brakfast.  Well, the waitress never came back and see how our food was.  And unfortunately this wasn't an isolated incident.  Another time, I was not feeling well, and wanted to pick up some chicken noodle soup to go.  I walked in, and stood there for 5-7 min before I finally grabbed one of the waitresses and asked \"excuse me, does anyone work here????\"
I don't expect too much from Bob Evan's, but this one is one of the worst when it comes to the services.  If you want breakfast, go across the street to Central Diner. Much better food with excellent service."}
{"text":"Chain? Yes. Do I still love it? Yes. Where else you get 2 eggs, turkey sausage, and a fluffly delicious blueberry pancake for $6? The service at this location is always great, my boyfriends mother and grandma come here regularly and are always pleased. We always come for breakfast, so I can't comment too thoroughly on their lunch and dinner, however I do know that their chicken pot pie is delicious."}
{"text":"Wait staff was nice, but there were not near enough people. Food was clearly rushed, then burnt when we asked for it to be cooked to be done. They did take some of it off the check, but not a good experience."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Bob Evans location for many years. It has been consistantly very good over the years. I recently had dinner there and noticed for the first time, a decline in overall quality. Portions were smaller. Common items were \"out of stock\". More desirable dining areas were closed due to under staffing. I wonder if this is the result of the recent selling of the Bob Evans restaurants and will be the norm. I am willing to try it one more time before I write off this restaurant."}
{"text":"To avoid the students I teach in small town America, I trekked down to CU for a place that was \"off the chain\". Not really...SO MANY CHAINS IN CHAMPAIGN. I wish there were more small, independent businesses. The IEA gift card was the reason I came here.

The service was okay. I had my refills of water, but this place was dead around lunch time! I decided to be really boring and start with chicken noodle soup (known as Chicken N Noodles). It was, in fact, just chicken, noodle, and soup. Not a lot of veggies swimming in that broth. Bob must be short on carrots and celery for Presidents' Day. No worries though, I got those glazed carrots with steamed broccoli on the way! I was disappointed because I wanted chili. NO CHILI TODAY? What about tamale? See what I did there?

Anyway, I went with the BIG FARM BACON CHEESEBURGER. No sauce. Warning to those watching their figures...don't get the sauce. It's usually a blend of mayo, 1000 island, and other crap. Yep, I hate that stuff.

So it was chicken noodle soup with a burger. Instead of fries and coleslaw, I loaded up on veggies. That was about 850 cals I wish I had on pancakes and omelets.

I would have gotten breakfast from the \"Fit From the Farm\" menu, but I had already had some pancakes for breakfast. I would have had the \"Be Fit Breakfast\", but I already pancaked it up!

Would I go back? Not without a GC! OPH is better for breakfast!

Perfect word to describe...eh."}
{"text":"I just had the worst experience at a restaurant that I have ever had at this place. Period. We arrived at 11 and were told there would be a ten minute wait. The whole lobby was full of people waiting at this time. When we went back to be seated we saw that there were three or four tables actually being occupied. The rest were open. There didn't appear to be any shortage of workers either to explain that.

When we got seated \"Jamie\" our server came over, no hello, no welcome. \"What do you want to drink?\" Was the only word she spoke to us. After placing our orders, sitting with empty coffees and waters for a half hour, a bus boy noticed the confused look on our faces and asked if we were okay. We asked for our food to be packaged to go since we had somewhere to be and honestly couldn't wait any longer. Well that really inconvenienced Jamie, but we got our food packed to go and left. Never returning.

We didn't go to Bob Evans for 5 star service, and we didn't expect to have the most awesome experience ever, but being acknowledged by our server and a \"hello\" was something we did expect (after all, she IS working for a tip). This was just so unpleasant for both me and my husband. I wouldn't even be willing to give this place another shot. If you want brunch, First Watch is up the street and you will at least be treated like you exist there. No wonder this place is so poorly rated."}
{"text":"One star is too much for this place. I have left a review for this place before and it wasn't good either. I wanted to give it a chance yet again.  I won't be back. 
I ordered boneless chicken breast and Mac and cheese.  The chicken breast was disgusting.  There was a large layer of cartilage on the whole chicken breast.  It was extremely greasy.  The Mac and cheese was cold and disgusting.   
When I complained about it. The manager stated that it is processed chicken and he can't control what is served at the restaurant.  That is completely the wrong thing to say.  Just apologize and try to make it better.  I didn't want anything. I was so disgusted by it and lost my appetite.  
Do not go here.  It is not worth it. The manager could care less.  He is full of excuses and shouldn't even be a manager.  Thanks for a great dinner Bob Evans.  I appreciate it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Bob Evans for a few years. My friend suggested the 3 course meal would be a good idea. I got a potato crusted flounder with fruit, he got a blackened steak with sweet potato. We got raspberry vinagrette salads, sundaes and some bread. :)  yeah 5 types of bread, unbeatable, they gladly accept vouchers.

The staff is friendly, very clean, double wiping tables. Service is quick and courteous.

Family style food, good conversation. :) Also feel like a kid again coming here~~"}
{"text":"Had dinner with family here yesterday. They have the new broasted chicken in dark meat and white. Tried it and it was alright. Parking is difficult in the lot sometimes, the path is curved."}
{"text":"Here on a trip I came for breakfast yesterday since it was the only thing open in the morning near my hotel. So glad I tried the scrambled eggs, I'm picky about my breakfast foods. I ordered these with American cheese, better then when I make them. Came back the next day too. Service is great, everyone is very welcoming."}
{"text":"Good service. No problems there. The food was mediocre. I got the veggie omelette as it comes with a side of fruit. Fruit was fresh. Veggies were good quality. Fresh with a crunch. But the omelette had zero flavor. It was extremely bland. I would get extra cheese or add salsa. IHOP has them beat so far. This was my first and only trip so far. Oh I have had their chocolate pie before. Those are amazing."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with what happened to me with the seating. There was a list and we were waiting for a table for 10 mins for 2 people. Then one group with 3 comes in and gets immediately seated. So I get up and ask about our table and said we were on the wait list. She apologized and sat is immediately however this would not have happened if there was one hostess or communication between hostess. Her error of course upset me because I was hungry, plus being up all night at work didn't help. However our server Sandy was wonderful! Her personality just brightened my morning! Great server and very friendly!"}
{"text":"I do really enjoy their breakfast here. I myself am not a big fan of their other foods but my girlfriend really likes coming here. She enjoys the BBQ and the pancakes. The ice tea is always fresh and the service has been on point over the years. I've been coming to this location for years and I've never had a bad experience.  I wouldn't come here for dinner or even lunch but its a sold three star breakfast."}
{"text":"Fast service, hot food, and a great waitress named Maggie. All this and on a Sunday at high noon"}
{"text":"Worst. Experience. Ever.

I ordered a dinner online as a reward for me and my bud after a hard day and paid by credit card through the site.  Picked the dinner, picked the time to retrieve it and paid. Presto, out the door to go retrieve it.

The restaurant was essentially empty except 3, 4 tables on a Saturday evening. The lobby was full of people trying to pay their bills or retrieve their to-go orders. I waited 20 minutes past my pick up time to get mine and waited another 10 minutes because the cashier was having trouble with the register (either her fault or the machine's).  The \"supervisor\" had to be called in and he informed me that I shouldn't have been charged twice, but if I was give them a call and they'll fix it.

I was charged twice, and for two entirely different amounts.  To this day I don't know what happened. I'm assuming I was also charged for one of the other people waiting in the lobby.

The dinner was completely inedible, even my dogs wouldn't eat their chicken.  It was tough as the bottom of a ten year old sneaker. The loaded potatoes were an inch of fixings, an inch of potatoes and another inch of grease.  The only thing that was edible was the cole slaw, which was rather tasty.  I apparently paid 58 bucks for it though and now I'm steaming.

Called the restaurant on Monday. Somebody will call me back. Called, Tuesday/Weds/Thursday. Somebody is going to call you back - promise.  Yeah, OK.  That never happened and finally I had to look up Evans corporate number and call them.

I got the extra charge reversed, as well as the meal comp'ed but it was one hell of a process to do so.  I got an email from Evans corporate two weeks ago apologizing for the whole mess (I never did hear from the restaurant itself) and they'd love to send me a gift card.  I accepted the offer and I'm still waiting as of today. Considering their corporate office is also in Ohio, they must be sending it on the back of a turtle.

There's no way I'd EVER go back to this particular restaurant, though I will give one of their other locations a try. If I ever get their promised gift card."}
{"text":"This place is quite charming and welcoming since their remodel.  The draw is the signature Big Boy sandwich, THE classic(and best) double-decker burger!  When I visit I always get the platter which includes fries and the best Cole slaw you will ever taste!"}
{"text":"Service is non existent. We have been here for 30 min and have ordered but only received one cup of coffee. Waitress is no where to be found and cooks must be on strike."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, we ordered salads and a pancake plate. We sat in a booth where the kitchen window was visible, our salads were up a few minutes after ordering but sat in the window for 17 minutes all while our waitress walked around coughing in her hand and serving coffee. We continued to watch as the wait staff leaned over our salads. About 20 some minutes after sitting on the counter our coughing waitress went over to the salads and scooped up the chicken for our salads with her bare hands and put it on our salads. She brought them to the table along with the very burnt pancakes. At this point we got up spoke to the manager and walked out, it was the worst dining experience I've ever had. Will never return to that place."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome! My husband and I came here for breakfeast and never had an empty glass. She was extremeley friendly and just all around awesome. The only reason Im giving 4 stars is because our food was slightly messed up. My eggs and steak  were overcooked. Other than that, the food was tasty and we had a great time."}
{"text":"This is your typical Bob Evans, and by that I mean, bursting with old folks.  The last time I came here the service was pretty crappy, I think all of the waitresses assumed that someone else was taking care of us when in fact no one was.  After 20 minutes of sitting there, we had to get up and let a hostess know - annoying!"}
{"text":"I hate when you go out and you here servers complaining. $29 sent steak back over cooked and never were offered 2nds on drinks and never tecieved offer for water or milk/juice. Food was ok, not good not horrible. Now im looking for a better breakfast spot thats not so expensive for what you get. My toast although not rye liked I asked it was buttery."}
{"text":"4 stars  for their pot roast sandwich!!! I absolutely loved it. The place is always clean and friendly."}
{"text":"i traveled to north carolina for a friend's wedding and mentioned i was looking forward to cracker barrel in the morning. my friend stated that he prefers bob evans and his friend agreed. i gave it a try and was not disappointed. in addition to very good food the service was fast and the staff was the most polite of any restaurant i've ever been. i ate a pretty bland meal so i don't want to give a final comparison to cracker barrel but if i'm ever around a bob evens again i will definitely stop by for another meal."}
{"text":"Holiday Feast Carryout Meals

We ordered one of the Thanksgiving Feasts for about $50 for four people. We chose ham as our main entree.

The entire meal was fantastic. The ham was perfectly prepared as was the stuffing, corn, mashed potatoes, green beans, and pumpkin pie. There was plenty of food and our entire family was very impressed.

The entire meal had an extremely home-cooked taste.

We will definitely order a holiday meal from Bob Evan's again. Most likely in less than a month from now!

If you want a home cooked holiday meal without the time and mess, this is an excellent option for you. And, I'm pretty sure it would have cost us more than $50.00 if we had bought all of the ingredients to make the variety of foods in this meal for four people.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We're on vacation from Virginia Beach and just came here for brunch. Everything was amazing from the moment we walked in. Taylor was our waitress and she was a doll! And the food was excellent, everyone is leaving happy (: thank you guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Just no. Our take out order is ALWAYS wrong. We waste so much time having to come back because they forgot something. Extremely disappointed. But the food is good."}
{"text":"Waitress was excellent fast service, even got me a coke to go without me asking . Food was good prices were decent ."}
{"text":"maybe it's just me but I had a pleasant dining experience here, overall my visit was quite satisfactory. would give it four stars if they perform this well on more complicated food but our breakfast order was right in their wheel house. place was populated but emptying out around 9:30.

Met a friend and her friend for breakfast, they were both seated when I arrived. Waitress came by as I sat down and returned shortly with a cup of hot fresh black coffee and glass of ice water. About fifteen minutes later she came back with CFS for me; eggs, cakes, cup o' biscuit-n-gravy for my friend; and blueberry cakes for her friend. Drink refills were timely as were polite inquiries about food and extras.

Food was good and hot and properly plated: eggs were up (bright, soft yolks + firming whites) cakes, meats, toasts, and taters arived as described."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food and great coffee! I always get a regular coffee with a vanilla shot on the side and milk. No need for sugar! This time I tried the blueberry French toast and it was pretty good! I'm never disappointed at bob Evans. Good place for breakfast lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Didn't know there could be such a bad Bob Evans. Opens at 7am (not early enough in my opinion) and every time you walk in.... it's a ghost town. No servers or hostess to be seen. Seat yourself and wait until they notice you exist. It's not clean either, junk left on tables way too long, dirty glasses, and I encourage you not to peak into the window of the kitchen. It's not pretty. This place shouldn't be in Lakewood anyways, we don't do chains here."}
{"text":"Horrible Service!! I will not go back. Took 20 minutes to get a drink. Really??? Waitress was blaming it on other people. Never again."}
{"text":"We met our daughter this morning at the Bob Evans restaurant in Broadview Heights Ohio. The first problem was the slow service. Once the order was placed it took one half hour to be served. All the breakfast meats (ham and turkey sausage) were obviously old and stale. They smelled and tasted bad. You needed a knife to cut the hash browns they were sticky and stuck together. The pancakes were served in a stack that was stuck together they could not be separated. I will probably eat at Bob Evans in the future, but never again at this location.

Update Directly after dining on Monday I posted on Bob Evans website. I received a reply within twelve hours and a personal contact from the General Manager within twenty four hours. He was apologetic and did refund the full price of the four meals. Will I go to this Bob Evans again, I don't know, but I am very impressed with the upper management response."}
{"text":"A great restaurant especially if you like breakfast foods.  I went here with a friend for like lunch on my most recent visit.  

We were greeted and seated quickly even though the restaurant appeared busy.  It took a little linger for our server to come to our table,  but like I said it was busy during our visit.   

My friend ordered pumpkin bread and it was delicious.   Very fresh and moist. 

We both ordered breakfast and were very happy with the amount of time it took as well as the heat and flavors.  I ordered the farmer's breakfast with a crepe.  The crepes here are really good.  I've never been disappointed with this breakfast.  

I didn't give this review a 5 stars because we had some issues during checkout,  but overall we were very satisfied with our lunch."}
{"text":"Typical Bob Evans. Not going to get great food, but you'll get a place that opens early. I have always been underwhelmed when I eat here. Poor service as well."}
{"text":"Large portions, friendly service. Clean atmosphere. Large menu full of options. An upscale version on Denny's. Prices are reasonable and everything was delicious. Great for casual comfort food in a no rush environment."}
{"text":"We sat while the hostess seated multiple other parties before us until we said something then were treated rudely when 7 of were seated at a table for 4. The manager just said sorry this is what we have available and then was also rude. I now know why this Bob Evans has a one star rating."}
{"text":"I went here because it's near my hotel and I was in the mood for some breakfast comfort food.
I sat the \"bar\" and ordered the Country Fried Steak with eggs and hash browns and grits.  Everything was really good.  The serving of grits was too much - when it's a side dish, I feel like it'd be more appropriate to serve maybe half a cup, instead of a whole bowl.  I could only eat less that half of it.
The server was very attentive and friendly, and the staff seems to be in good spirits.
My food came out six minutes after I ordered it - Super fast!
This place is good if you want fast, yummy food at reasonable prices, but don't have high expectations for atmosphere or service."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this Bob Evans location. I was meeting friends for breakfast. When I came in there was no one in the waiting area and there was not an employee at the hostess desk. I texted my friends to see where they were sitting. Our server was nice. She took our drink order quickly. She then took our food order in a timely manner. Then it was like time slowed down. It took awhile for us to get our food. The restaurant was over half empty so I didn't think our food should have taken that long. Once we got food mine was barely room temperature. I didn't send it back because I was hungry and I had no idea how late no it would be before I got food back. I had ordered the breakfast that was an omelette in a skillet with sausage, sausage gravy, potatoes, and cheese on top. The sausage was starting to harden because it was getting cold. My omelette was getting colder by the second. The cheese was not gooey but also hardening. There was only a tiny bit of gravy. The potatoes were the only thing still warm. Our server only came by twice more for drink refills and to give us our check. If the restaurant had been full or even had more customers than it did I might be more understanding of the borderline cold food and the lack of face time with our server. This was not a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"Table for 5 of us. Mold on the rye bread served to my mother.  Instead of removing the one meal from the receipt, we were offered a limited amount of \"to go items\". Last time we will be here."}
{"text":"Service poor, salad had frozen head lettuce
Chicken pot pie, thick hard crust; good coffee
But had to wait too long for butter for baked potato"}
{"text":"Amazing food every time. Service can be a little slow, but they are generally great, and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We always have good food from this location. 
We use the curbside and takeout service more than anything, so WE don't get too annoyed with the kids, but the staff is always friendly and accommodating"}
{"text":"Restaurant: Bob Evans

Logistics: For a typical Sunday afternoon, parking was full but attainable.  The hostess was very cordial and welcoming which made the wait tolerable as well.

Atmosphere and ambiance: The restaurant had a very obvious placement of children and families to one side and couples and elderly on the other. The execution of this presented a flaw. Some of the waitress staff working on the \"children\" side were clearly flustered. 

Service:
Attention to detail is a staple of a good wait staff. Unfortunately for this location, they dropped the plate. In a nutshell, the attending waitress was very slow and butchered my meal order.
 To add insult to injury, I regularly frequent Bob Evans for their endless cups of coffee. I had an empty mug several times. It almost seemed like an inconvenience to my waitress that I wanted my coffee refilled.
The time to order finally arrived. Despite the fact we spoke coherently, the waitress managed to botch the order. 

Example: 
Ordered: Hotcakes, scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese, hash browns and bacon. 
Upon receipt: regular eggs without cheese, house fried and no syrup with my hotcakes. 


Meal:
Presentation: The portions here are meager in comparison to other locations. The hotcakes were light and fluffy.  The bacon was cooked well. The house fries I did not order were 90% charred. 
 
Conclusion:
This location did not hold up to its \"down on the farm\" mantra. The poor food presentation was eclipsed moreover by an unfortunate service staff. Despite being an isolated visit, it will be noted going forward."}
{"text":"Just don't. I have given this location several tries without any luck. I honestly don't think they are staffed properly and expect everyone to do a million things at once for a really low wage."}
{"text":"They claimed to be significantly busy. Only 20 people in the restaurant. Terrible service. Orders were wrong and food wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Went back after having NO service12  min & it seems that there is new managment in place, we noticed a differance right away. Too soon to tell but we had a much beeter dinning experience than in the previous months."}
{"text":"The restaurant was out of both the meatloaf and pot pie which is what we ordered. After choosing chicken Parmesan and spaghetti we found we made horrible choices. Not really sauce but clumps of meat mingled with tomatoes. Nothing sticks to the noodles so all in all really unpleasant meal"}
{"text":"I have given them a chance multiple times thinking maybe it was just that shift but on my last attempt, I will never be back. I ordered a to go order. It was said to be ready in 20 min. I got there on time and was told by the manager it would be a few minutes. I waited patiently after 20 min a waitress said I am sorry the herb chicken will take another 20 min, or do you just want to get roasted chicken it would only be 4 min. So I said fine the roasted. After another 5 min I asked if they even received my order. There was no reason chicken would take that long if the had received my order the 45 min prior when I placed it. She said oh no that one just takes longer. So I waited an additional 5 minutes and she apologized for the wait I told her that was ridiculous for the food to take that long. The manager avoided me and did nothing to make up for the terrible service. When I got home they gave me fried chicken and the other meal I ordered was cold because it had been waiting that whole time. This has happened to me at breakfast also making me very late to work. I have also tried eating in and the order was wrong and service was still slow. They need to adjust the pick up time or learn how to service their orders in a timely manner. I suggest the Cracker Barrel across the street they have much better service."}
{"text":"Yes it is a chain but not everyone in the world is familiar with the Bob Evans experience. In a world of random Waffle Houses and inconsistent IHOP's Bob is a beacon in the night. 

Biscuits are very good and service is always with a smile. I think their strong suit is their breakfasts but my hubby did like his burger last time and couldn't finish it. 

Their whole wheat pancakes were shockingly good and who can resist their biscuit bowls...basically breakfast in a bowl shaped and sized biscuit. 

Went here for my birthday breakfast (yes I am that kind of person who celebrates her birthday all day) and they sang happy birthday to me and gave me a cinnamon bun with a candle in it since it was morning. And it was very very very good. 

Bob doesn't reinvent the wheel but always a solid meal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was good, all 6 of us had various items and they did a good job. My cobb salad wad fresh and well made, was not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Bob Evans is, you know, Bob Evans.  I usually like the meals but as I increasingly need to be concerned with more than just taste, I am finding my options to be limited.  I usually look for low calories overall and low sugar and carbs specifically.  My companion, however, needs to worry about sodium.  Bob Evans does not have a low sodium menu but the manager suggested grilled chicken (which it turns out has more than 500mg of sodium), mashed potatoes with no gravy or butter added, and carrots. So that's what she got. I got the potato crusted flounder.

So the taste was good, the service was good, the dining room nice, but too much sodium and calories to eat on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My family and I had breakfast there and it was ok.  The food was not very hot because it was served on cold plates.  The pancakes did not taste like they were homemade.  My coffee was hot.  The service was ok but could have been better.  Overall if this was not so close to our hotel I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"We had stayed in town on a cross-country trip and thought it would be a no-brainer to go to Bob Evans for breakfast. I was delighted that they had a gluten-free menu. My husband is particularly fond of biscuits and gravy and he was quite excited to order them. In our party we ordered eggs bacon hash browns, biscuits and gravy, sausage cheeseburgers and macaroni and cheese. Unfortunately all were either undercooked under flavored or just plain terrible tasting. The beloved biscuits and gravy was not sausage gravy but  brown gravy with minimal sausage pieces. It has been a long time since we were at Bob Evans. The whole experience was so disappointing. The waitress was even flat. I would not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick bite to eat for breakfast before shopping.This was my second trip to bob evens and I think it will be my last. I've only been here one other time when I was younger and I don't recall liking it but I wanted to give it a try today. When I first walked in the servers where being loud and talking to people in the back from the front. Next off i waited about four minutes before even being greeted and seated when it was not even busy. When I'm seated the area is so unorganized and chairs misplaced and tables still dirty. She walked away and a male server came over to take our order. I got a lemon water and was brought over with no lemon in it. My guest got a coffee and I immediately said \"don't drink that\" there's someone's lipstick all over the cup. That was all sorted out and then onto the food, I got the Homested breakfast. My eggs where sunny side up but very over cooked no dippy. The biscuits where good very fluffy and fresh. The hash browns where a good golden brown. The sausage was dry and tasted over cooked. The sausage gravy was what you expected nothing crazy I thought it needed more pepper to it. Over all I'm pretty disappointed with this experience I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Looking for breakfast in Solon, OH?  Look no further than Bob Evans in Solon, OH!  First Watch is the other breakfast option in Solon, but that place is gross compared to tasty, convenient, low prices you can find at Bob Evans.  Very nice service staff as well."}
{"text":"Wavering between a 2 and a 3. Service was a 4 and food was a 2. May or may not return, really want to give then another shot. We visited on a Sunday morning so it was busy but since there was only 2 of us we got a table right away. Our waitress was very friendly and kept our coffee filled. The food however was a big fat failure. I chose one of the summer specials, the strawberry bake. It was very small and way too sweet. There was about 10 pieces of what looked and tasted like cinnamon buns pieces that werr literally swimming in a pool of some of the sweetest, over sugared strawberries ice ever tasted. Then it was topped with fake whipped cream which I personally can't stand. The accompanying hash browns were good on the outside and raw under the crispy exterior. Ugh. My husband's food, the sausage gravy breakfast bowl tasted good but was so tiny in comparison to every other breakfast restaurant we have gone too. He mentioned that you wouldn't want to show up there hungry cause your be disappointed. I really want to go back to try their chicken salad I saw advertised but I'm kind of leery about returning. I guess time will tell...10% military discount at the register."}
{"text":"Came I for quick breakfast before an appointment.  An hour and a half before the appointment, which was just down the street. The time on the receipt, when I paid was 15 after that appointment. We waited nearly an hour for for eggs, potatos, sausage and toast. I can't even comprehend how it could take half that time. They were not busy, there was maybe 15 tables when we were sat. The manager came by right after we ordered the disappeared. The potatoes were soaked in grease, the toast was burnt. I won't be retuning to this location"}
{"text":"Ordered family meal online in advance and still had wait a half an hour past the pick up time. They didn't have their wildfire ranch dressing they were out of pot pies, didn't have any peanut butter pies, I only got half a container of green beans and the rolls were packed right out of the oven so they were all sweaty and squished when I got home."}
{"text":"Came to grab breakfast with my family. Kristen was such a horrible server. From the time she didn't take our drink orders or follow up to the time she brought us the wrong meals. Step your game up."}
{"text":"Go here often for brunch and the decor turns me off....but somehow it's clean and the staff is friendly.  More importantly, the food was good; as in well made.  Takes a bit of time to arrive though.  I think this place is pulling itself together, albeit slowly."}
{"text":"This Bob Evans is understaffed, but the food was good.  Our server was nice but slow.  They did not have a host or hostess, so seating was also very slow.
This place also got a remodel.  It doesn't look like a traditional Bob Evans...all the older folk were complaining about it.  
When you haven't changed the look of your country-themed breakfast place since its inception, then updating it from the checkered-oilcloth-farm look to a modern/ minimalist look is not a good idea.  It's like combining a Frank Lloyd Wright ripoff with a barn.  Also, from what my Granny and others said...OLD FOLKS DON'T LIKE IT."}
{"text":"Took 45 minutes for our egg breakfasts to come out of the kitchen.  Notice lots of food sitting in the window for longer then ten minutes.  The decor is new, which just doesn't jive with \"down on the farm\"-looks urban. Bob Evans used to NEVER disappoint-now it's getting more difficult"}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just want breakfast.  I get that.  I've only had breakfast foods here, so I can't comment on anything else.

The pancakes are pretty good, but they're huge.  I can barely finish half of them even when I'm really hungry.  I'm a huge fan of breakfast potatoes, and I've never been disappointed with them here.  Everything I've tried has been pretty good, though nothing outstanding.  I think you could order just about anything without being disappointed, so long as you don't look at the nutritional information.

I don't go here often, however, because it never sits well with me afterwards.  I once ate here for breakfast before meeting with a professor, and that was a poor choice.  I'm happy he was running late too so I didn't have to explain what kept me..."}
{"text":"Today went to breakfast at Bob Evans in mayfield heights and worst experience ever.   After 25 min of no contact from our waitress and multiple tables complaining in our section of terribly slow service our food finally arrived after 45 min.   Didn't realize eggs took so long at a breakfast place during breakfast!   No apology for wait at any time and to top it off our food was served cold as it was sitting in the window for 10 minutes!   When we said something about the cold food we were told it was the kitchen's fault even though it was sitting in the window for 10 minutes. Again no manager bother coming over or apology given just told wish I could cook the food myself from the waitress it would be faster than. Told her we were leaving and no one seemed bothered. Used to go once a month here this will be the last time I ever patronize this restaurant."}
{"text":"Walked in craving breakfast/brunch, walked out an hour and a half later without having taken our order or eaten.

Never going back."}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit this Bob Evans while on a quick trip to the Cleveland area in June.  My son and I were meeting my Mother-in-Law and family for dinner, and liked it enough that we returned the next morning for breakfast.  (Ok, it helped that our hotel was directly across the street and did not include a morning meal...)

The service during our first visit was a bit rough, but then there were five of us at the table, and we were in no rush.  The waitress was young, and new to the game, so did not see that we were there for a long meal.  I fully understood, as this is a \"casual\" chain, just a step up from fast food, so people don't usually linger over a meal.  

I ordered carry out of baked goods that evening, and everything was packed well enough to make the long trip the next day.  They were also able to send me off with a few boiled eggs, which I appreciated.  It amazes me how many restaurants won't boil an egg.  But I digress.

The next morning, we ate breakfast at the same location.  Service for the morning shift was much better, and as we lingered over a final meal with our family, we were pleased that we had made the decision to return.  

Having trouble making a choice on the menu? Go for the breakfast items.  I'm a corn meal mush and sausage girl all the way!"}
{"text":"This place gets 1/2 star for being open and 1/2 star because the dinner rolls are good (although \"endless\" is a misnomer, more on that later). That's it. My husband and I were seated at a booth in the middle of the restaurant and promptly forgotten about. Three other parties were sat around us, one right next to us. They were helped, offered drinks, orders were placed, and it was like we were invisible. Even after we asked for help, it took forever. We only got one set of silverware. Even after we asked for another set it took so long to get it that we ended up eating our meal sharing the single set. My meal came with \"endless dinner rolls\". I asked for additional rolls and they were conveniently out at the moment, but there were more \"in the oven and would be ready in 8 minutes\". When we left 15 minutes later, there was no mention of them, a sorry it took so long, nothing. My ham and swiss melt was the sloppiest made sandwich I have ever tried to eat. It was made in such a hurry the cheese wasn't even melted. It was at that awkward warm greasy stage. This place is in Lakewood, there are a million places to eat in Lakewood, skip this one."}
{"text":"I always like the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and green beans.  This Bob Evans was like the others.  Average chain service.  Good when needing something familiar :-)"}
{"text":"Great for spot for a quick meal. Great breakfasts! Love the Cobb salad and turkey dinner. Good service and clean. Can't ask for much more in a chain restaurant.  Don't forget to print out your coupons. See you for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Wow we must have stopped in on a bad night! She took our order and my wife's biscuits came in a few minutes. Ten minutes later our drinks came when I asked for the silverware and butter so my wife could butter eat her biscuits.  Ten more minutes pass, our dinners show up but no silverware or butter and no garlic sauce which my wife's chicken should have been cooked in and my son receives the wrong order,  five more minutes before it makes it to our table.  So we start eating,  my wife's chicken dinner was cold and I don't know how you under cook hash browns but they weren't cooked. So your thinking this guy is just super critical of a busy Saturday night restaurant but reason we went in was there was only four cars in the parking lot. I should've known better and passed this place up."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  We stopped in for an early dinner and both our service and food were awful. There were only a few people in the restaurant and we still couldn't get decent service. Our server kept going across the restaurant and sitting down. Most of the staff was just hanging out talking and laughing.  Even the manager seemed to be one of the gang instead of inspiring a good work ethic.  Our food was terrible.  Iced tea with no ice, lukewarm gravy, rock-hard biscuits, etc.  Such a shame since they just completed a renovation and the inside is lovely.  Next time we want breakfast food, we'll head to IHOP."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Waitress was excellent. We're just passing through but wish this place was near home. Would go there often."}
{"text":"Worst service ever at breakfast! I have never been dissatisfied enough to leave zero tip, but this one earned it. Food sat in the window for ten minutes and came out cold. Our server never checked in with us or refilled coffee. Left after an hour still needing breakfast and coffee. The worst."}
{"text":"We walked out!

Waiting 15 min to order when the restaurant is empty is unacceptable. Brought our business to Denny's. Too bad as this would have been our 1st time to Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Pretty bad food.  My steakhouse burger was ice cold with a side of cold soggy fries.  I couldn't eat a bite.  My son got chicken tenders that were dry and stringy: well over cooked."}
{"text":"No surprises here.  The turkey dinner is pretty good, and the rolls are outstanding as usual at a Bob Evans.  The service is fine and did not leave me waiting.  Not much more to say other than stop in if you are OK with the food here, which is always decent."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Bob Evans! Get there on a Sunday late morning, there is NOONE waiting, MULTIPLE tables available, yet the hostess says, it will be a few, \"I gotsta clean da table\". Really?! 10 min later, we finally got a table. The section was not busy, a family of 4 sat down 10 minutes after we did and ordered a good 5-10 minutes after we did. But who got there food first? They did. Two people vs four! Waitress said, I'm going to figure out what's happening. Never came back once the food was finally brought out to say, who is everything, more coffee, more water....nothing. But she was Johnny on the spot bringing the bill! Get it together people. Management is failing there and it's only been open just over a year. Pathetic!"}
{"text":"If you live anywhere in Ohio then you know of Bob Evans.  They are an affordable family restaurant with a simple and old traditional styled kitchen where you can sit and eat at the counter or sit down in either wooden tables and chairs or padded wooded booths.  The Bob Evans family farm is located in southern Ohio and they have brochures on the farm festival and when to visit.  Bob Evans has always had a comfortable, homely feel and effect to not just myself but others as well to never create a feeling of disappointment when it was decided as a dining option.

This visit was an exception for the very worst and I've NEVER had a bad experience at Bob Evan's before.  What makes this even more upsetting after the dozens of times I've been with several individuals to many Bob Evan's, including this one, is that I took a very near and dear friend to me to this Bob Evans on her birthday after we came from the Cleveland Clinic in Twinsburg.  

Right from the start it was upsetting because we wanted a booth but none of them were clean or they were taken.  Not that big of a deal but my friend has spine and neck issues so the padded booths are more comfortable and roomy for her but the chairs aren't unpleasant either.  As soon as we were seated and became comfortable, we immediately thought of coffee.  I took the cup and flipped it over, as Bob Evans always sets up the tables with the coffee cups upside down, and I was surprised in the most unpleasant way.  The cup was definitely not clean.  I was so much in surprise by this that I as I took out my phone to take a picture I did not see that our server noticed what I was doing and tried to take the cup away from me before I took the picture followed up with a comment, \"Looks like someone was drinking Hot Chocolate!\".  I would have been a little more inviting towards her and even replied back with a joke if she didn't try so hard to take the cup away from me.  

It was after this incident I felt the whole birthday brunch I was giving my friend was diminished because our server gave us the BARE MINIMUM amount of attention and treatment.  When she returned with coffee, poured it, she didn't even look at me as I was trying to get her attention.  The server continued to ignore me, she didn't even LOOK at me or say anything as she had her head turned away from me and was looking towards another table that had just come in!  As she was pouring, I was trying to tell her I wanted some water but she didn't even bother to pay any attention to me as she poured coffee, looked away at another table and headed towards that table even after I said very noticeably, \"Excuse me?\" without sounding upset.  My friend and I had already been sitting there 5 minutes and received a dirty coffee cup followed by a clean coffee cup and coffee for both of us and the table that the server just walked towards with her coffee pot had already had water, and coffee all before they even took their coats off!  I was getting upset VERY quickly because above all my friend on her birthday deserved better, MUCH better as we have experienced at Bob Evans before.  The server didn't change her \"tone\" through the whole experience.  When our food came out it was the first time I had seen our server in what seemed like ten minutes and I had asked for water.  Well, my friend and I began eating our food and just like the other times, the food has always been pleasant and we were back in our good moods.  Half way through our meals I still had not received my water.  I just happen to glance up at the kitchen area and make a brief moment of eye contact with our server.  A minute after this glance, she came by and made another joke that I was not laughing at. \"Oh, I filled your water glass and just left it there and walked away.\"  Honey, I'm not laughing at all with the service you have provided.  I just simply said, \"Thank you.\"  She walked away and didn't bother asking if we needed anything else, not a refill on coffee or even bother to offer water to my friend!  I can honestly say at this point, the whole experience was a test of self control because I didn't want to make a scene to upset my friend on her birthday.  

We were still working on our food and the server came by and just placed the check on the table.  She didn't even bother to ask if we would like anything.  She just assumed that we were done, placed the check down and walked away.  My friend and I were done and she wanted to take some of her pancakes she ordered home. Of course our server was nowhere to be seen and we needed a box for her pancakes. I was not going to wait so I walked up to the counter and pay.  When the cashier asked how everything was, I replied in the most calm voice I could, \"Well, we've been waiting for our server to come back and check on us because we need a box to pack up our food!\"  This was a REAL test of my self control because I could have thrown a fit about our server. 

I don't see us returning to this location anytime."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE FIRST BOB EVAN'S TO EVER OFFER ME THE WILDFIRE RANCH DRESSING TO GO!  

     Whenever I come to Bob Evan's I order one of their salads.  Whether it is the lunch soup/salad special or ordering the crispy chicken salad I ALWAYS order it with the Wildfire Ranch dressing.  This is truly one of the BEST salad dressings in my opinion (right next to Olive Garden's Signature Italian Dressing but you can find that one in the store). 
     At this establishment I ordered the lunch special this time.  As always, I ordered the coffee.  I also ordered the chili for the soup which was hot and tasteful along with the salad.  For $7.99 that is quite the deal for a meal!  After the meal, I tried something that I have done before.  I asked for their Wildfire Ranch dressing to go and they gave it to me!  Usually I am told they cannot but this establishment gave me some to go!  I was SO impressed!  Thank you!  
      This Bob Evan's was busy and the noise level was average but overall, this was one of the more enjoyable establishments and I have some of their dressing for home! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving special is awesome! only 12.99 including entree, bread, soup or salad, two sides and pie. It's super thanksgiving deal!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Waited at hostess desk while hostess and servers chatted and ignored us. When I turned around to just leave I was finally greeted.  Waitress ignored us after our food came out.  Service sucks.  Go across the street to Cracker Barrel for good service."}
{"text":"Entrance of restaurant is beautiful , the seating area table not so clean,(see pictures)
Menu was so off as of how the photos on the menu are so misleading compared to the size or amount of food that's actually served to you.

When I received my sirloin steak, it wasn't even a real steak, it was like eating a piece of beef pot roast that shredded really easy and NOT like steak .
Also the menu doesn't explain what type of potatoes are on the photo which i thought I was getting what was on the menu photo and I got regular hash browns.. 
Also the table was kinda of dirty before we sat down, no one really cleaned it well seeing some food particles next to the sugars and salt and pepper shakers.
Plus the walls next to my table had finger prints all over it, really disgusting to see!!! Managers responsibility !!!
Also the receipt shows Breakfast Blend with a price of $2.19 with no explains toon what it is !!!

The amount of food is really small compared to a Denny's which they give you more for your money and they serve you a real steak, not pot roast!!!
I approve this review

{"text":"I simply do not get this bob Evans. The service here is by far the worst I have ever seen at bob Evans. The servers are rude. They don't care about the tables. I just don't get it. Every single time I have been to this one, every single time, I have encountered bad service. Badly cooked food, bad servers, everything.

This last visit we were sat by one server, since both hosts, another server and the manager were all out the check out counter helping what looked like one or if they were not together two customers. Another server took our drink order. And the server who was supposed to take our main order never appeared, the excuse was given that she had a big party in the other section. First of all why are giving a server a party in one half of the restaurant and seating them in the other? Where is the logic in that?

Finally after inquiring about where are server was we got yet another server who seemed very not busy and uninterested in our table.

I asked what kind of soup he had. His response was.

O we have everything on there.

really? Even though the menu says selections may vary and often times says ask your server.

He did not refill our drinks and pretty much vanished.

Where was the manager in all this? Standing at the counter people can sit at and eat and talking with what I assume is a regular customer. He never walked around the place asking how every ones meal was. Just stood their talking.

On an earlier visit my pasta was so over cooked it was inedible. Almost like eating gum.

If you like Bob evans avoid this one like the plague.
Try the one in solon or twinsburg."}
{"text":"Stopped coming here.  Very slow for food to arrive.  Entrees just do not seem fresh...like reheated leftovers.  This has been the past 4 visits."}
{"text":"We stopped by one Saturday for breakfast, and were very impressed!  We both had the Farmer's Breakfast with a blueberry crepe.  I had scrambled eggs with cheddar, bacon, and hash browns, and my hubby had fried eggs, ham, and fried potatoes.   

I'll start by saying that these were some of the best scrambled eggs I've had in awhile, with the cheese nicely melted.  My hubby's fried eggs were perfectly cooked at medium.  We both preferred the fried potatoes over the hash browns, as they were just a bit more flavorful.  The crepes were fantastic, and provided just the right balance of sweetness with our savory breakfast.  My bacon was thick and nicely crispy, and the ham was also thick and very tasty.  (It wasn't country ham, if you were wondering.)

As to the coffee...we loved that the coffee was stronger than you'd usually get at an IHOP or Cracker Barrel.  Even though they have flavored creamers on the tables, they'll happily get you regular creamer upon request.

While they weren't busy when we were there, service was friendly and very speedy.  We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot, quick service, and friendly staff. Stopped in for breakfast last weekend, got the pancakes which were extremely big and good! My husband got the biscuits and gravy, which he said were delicious... ask for an extra biscuit and it's perfect. Although it's a chain, their food all seems fresh, and the prices are very reasonable. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'll NEVER patronized this Bob Evans again. It wasn't that crowded and we were seated right away. A young man that appeared to be a manager took our order. People came and went around us, but our food never came till about 45 minutes later. A young girl brought our food but never came back to ask if we needed anything. She appeared very flustered and said how busy they were and that our order had been \"lost\".  After our meal, we had to ask at the counter for a take out box. At the register were two young people hanging around, laughing and chatting. They seemed to care less when we said that we didn't get our check. They asked who our server was and she again hurriedly swiped something at the register to give us our receipt. At that point she never even looked at us or apologized for the terrible service. I see several other posts about this restaurant and its management. There is a definite need for change in this place if they want repeat customers."}
{"text":"Their sausage gravy and cinnamon is damn good.  The rest is decent enough.  Service was good despite busy Sunday morning crowd"}
{"text":"Had to try this place out before leaving Ohio. Customer service exceeded my expectations however their menu seemed southern. I ordered a salad and it was ok, iceberg lettuce and chicken with pecans. Nothing special. Their country fried steak was a little salty. I enjoyed the interior and on the menu it explained the history of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Really awful.  My mom's chicken pot pie was mushy and bland.  My steak and eggs with potatoes were terrible - the steak had an odd taste and the potatoes were not cooked. Sweet waitress, I feel sorry for her."}
{"text":"So proud of the workers at this location for dealing with this aftermath of Kent OH Halloween and Sunday church goers. We had a 20min wait and so did everyone else. But everyone seemed happy and content. Me and my friends got a great seat and great service! I got the Breakfast Combo which came with hot cakes and bacon & eggs. The food was perfect and tasty. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Very kid friendly. They have special straws for kids, booster seats that buckle them in, fruit and yogurt platter along with other options."}
{"text":"Every Bob Evans I've ever been to is extremely kid (and baby!) friendly, which is huge if you've got young kids in tow.  This particular Bob Evans has some of the nicest waitstaff I've met; they were very attentive and seemed to be genuinely enjoying their work.  The food quality is standard for Bob Evans -- once you've been to one, you've been to them all.  That is to say: good down-home country cooking, classic diner fare, tasty breakfasts, all at a decent price-point.

As I've mentioned elsewhere, a trip to any one of these casual dining chain restaurants is an exercise in expectation management.  Bob Evans will never earn awards from snooty foodie publications for their food, and that's quite okay with me.  I'll take the kid-friendly (and somehow relatively quiet) environment and enthusiastic service any day.  My wife loves their pot roast sandwiches; I'm partial to their breakfasts.  My son devours their pancakes.  My entire family walks out happy!"}
{"text":"we beat the breakfast rush and the place was half empty - seated quickly then completely ignored. We waited about 10 minutes before leaving. We weren't even given a glass of water. Completely unacknowledged. Boooo"}
{"text":"Worst Bob Evans we've ever been to. Went for lunch, restaurant was half empty and had to wait for 10 minutes to sit. Service was poor at best. Will drive to next exit before stopping here again."}
{"text":"Charming people~ both the server and the manager on duty tried to replace our horrible breakfast but we declined~ except we asked for biscuits with real butter to replace our toast which had some sort of evil looking and tasting bright yellow \"spread' on it. Eggs were not properly cooked. As I eat mine sunny side up I allow a lot of leeway~ but they were not even warm and were too gelatinous. The potatoes were burnt. Awful meal. Nice people, but awful food. Never again."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience today at Bob Evans. After doing some research into the company, I've learned that they were taken over by the private equity firm, Golden Gate Capital recently. 
Apparently, the Bob Evans Restaurants have become notorious for treating their employees poorly, threatening them, paying them extremely low wages and providing them with bare minimum & often inadequate medical benefits.
This must be why we were shocked by the negative experience we had today at this restaurant. I won't name names or share too much here but after reading a little bit about what has happened to this once great organization, my heart goes out to the people still being forced to work there (for whatever reason). And I hope they can find work with a better employer soon.
In the meantime, I will only dine at quality establishments NOT affiliated with Golden Gate Capital. 
RIP Bob Evans. Used to be a nice place to go for breakfast. Now it's dirty & slow. Sad..."}
{"text":"For breakfast during the work week, I'm a simple guy..gimme a bowl of oatmeal and a cup of joe and I'm good to go. When I have a chance for a nice casual breakfast on the weekends, I usually find myself here. I've been frequenting Bob Evans since I was a kid sitting in a high chair. It was a favorite of both sets of grandparents, one set that didn't have the luxury of having one in their state. When they visited here, this was where they wanted to go. I'm a one-hit wonder kinda guy. I find something I love and order it every time. For Bob Evans, it's a full stack of pancakes, a side of bacon, a side of sausage links, and a cup of joe. It's an American breakfast for a red-blooded, freedom loving American guy. I usually soak them in their awesome maple syrup. I know it's a chain and it's not normally my thing, but Bob Evans does breakfast better than anyone around. I'm 41 years old now and don't see another place wooing me away, at least when it comes to a carb loaded breakfast!"}

{"text":"I used to have lunch here regularly five years ago. Just returned today and was horrified. The place is filthy, the carpet in the main dining are is black with grease and dirt, and you cannot see the material on the seat backs because they are black. Looks as if nothing has been cleaned for a year. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This beacon of light half way thru a five hour trip appeared as if a mirage in the distance...or, ya know, on the corner.  

We arrived and made a dash straight to the restrooms which we were happy to discover were very clean. We were a party of nine so they couldn't sit us at the same table so split us into two tables right next to each other, which suited us fine. 

Our waitress could not have been less thrilled to serve us. I don't think I saw her crack a grin, much less a smile, the entire time. 

The food was decent. The pancakes had a seriously tough exterior, but the eggs were yummy, the biscuits and gravy devine, and my toast wasn't overly buttered (Rebeca has me looking out for that now). 

I had asked for there to be two seperate checks since trying to figure out a nine person tab could get ugly, however when it came time to pay, one check. 

Thank goodness everyone just decided to split the cost, which was wonderfully affordable, instead of picking it apart cent by cent. 

Overall, a good travel spot for decent food."}
{"text":"Bob Evans is a decent breakfast place. Whatever you order, it will be done right and you won't mind the prices. The service is okay but there's one thing that bugs me about Bob Evans - any Bob Evans restaurant:

They really want you to hurry up and get out so they can turn the table. You can tell from the minute you walk in. If there's a wait, ( there always is on saturday or sunday) in the back of your mind you know some people are in line watching you eat, hoping you'll hurry up so they can get your table. The waitress wants you to order your breakfast as soon as you sit down but she'll be patient and wait the 30 seconds it takes for her to get your coffee. Any longer and you'll get the look. Your food arrives a couple of minutes later. You eat for a few minutes and she's back. Is everything okay? More coffee? Here's your bill. Take it up front. You wolf down your eggs and find yourself doing the unthinkable, you tell your partner, \"C'mon, honey, finish your coffee so we can get the hell out of here.\" She slows down on purpose and now your heart rate is up and you can't wait to get out. There's a line at the checkout. C'mon, let's go, people. The lady waiting for a table, just off the highway with her six kids is looking at you. If she weren't so polite, she'd call you something rude. You're the problem. You're the reason she can't have breakfast. You hang your head in shame. You want to apologize. You pay. Was everything all right? Yeah, sure. You breathe hard a few times and you're back out into the world. It's over. Breakfast is over. It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

The prices are good and the biscuits are great with honey. Maybe it's a lot more fun on a blizzardy tuesday at 10:00 am in February. Maybe."}
{"text":"My son and I met the ex there for a turkey dinner the night before Thanksgiving. We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess. The waitress was there quickly, we got our drinks and ordered. We all ordered basically the same thing.
Food was served without undue delay, the waitress was friendly and engaging. She kept up with our table in spite of being busy, refilling drinks when needed. The food was just fine. Terrific fresh hot biscuits and buns.
Well done...not a single complaint."}
{"text":"The food was reasonably good, but the service was inexcusably slow. 15 minutes to have our drink order taken. Another 10 to have our order taken, and then 30 minutes to get our food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I only like this place because I grew up with it in Ohio.  We used to go all the time.  This location is further than I'd like to drive.  The food is always good, same old childhood memories, so that's not what this rating is based on.  Every single time I have been here, it a 2 HR or more ordeal!' They are sooo slow.  The food doesn't come out all at once, there's always someone waiting for something.  My nephew basically ate all my food before his came out & all he had was pancakes and sausage!  The service isn't really so great, the servers I had all seem very lazy and as if they are inconvenienced if we ask for anything.  I've been here on several occasions, all different times of day and evening...still the same.  It's extremely annoying and very disappointing.  Especially for my drive to get there."}
{"text":"Not sure if this under new management, but the service and quality of food has consistently gone down hill over the last year or so.   We have been going to this Bob Evans as long as it has been here.  Very sad to see the change.   Tried 3 or 4 different times.   Plan to go to other Bob Evans in the future and we live 3 mins from this one."}
{"text":"Bob's got himself one large, country-wide menu; I'll say that much. Not being enthusiastic about coming here, I went with one of their Big Farm Burgers; The Three-Cheese Burger. You get \"American, Monterey-Jack and shredded cheddar, green leaf lettuce, tomato, Claussen pickles and red onion.\" 

It wasn't a bad burger but would run and hide somewhere if a Tessaro's burger stomped into the room. You could almost detect that the patty had been frozen. Almost. They do something to it to disguise the fact. 

I did dig the miniature flag they stuck in the middle of it, however. 

I was allowed to sub onion petals for fries, and I guess I wouldn't have missed much had I followed protocol. Yellow, crunchy, and devoid of taste they were. 

BE does make a pretty passable cole slaw as well as a fine, tart lemonade and a solid cherry cobbler a la mode, which our ditzy, young waitress forgot to heat for me. Said server also forgot mayo for my burger, and kept apologizing for being forgetful, going on to explain that she \"keeps messing up orders 'cause it's like, my first day back after 3 weeks and stuff.\" 

Methinks she had one more wild time last night and was still recuperating from it.   

I'll be kind and give 'em a solid 3 stars. Aside from the onion petals, nothing I had was awful, and our cute, flaky server was amusing enough to help make the meal fun. 

2 gift cards down, 2 to go. Outback and Spaghetti Warehouse, here we come.

Chains, chains pulling me down...

{"text":"Ehhhh, I don't like going to Bob Evans, but my parents like them for some reason, even ranking them higher than Eat 'n Park!  This is where they wanted to go the other night after visiting a relative at an area hospital, and since I'd not reviewed this one yet, I wasn't about to protest. 

I'd say that a race between Bob Evans and Denny's would end in a photo finish. Regardless, I just never know what the hell I want when I go to a BE's, since their menu never really entices me much (at least Denny's tries to come up with somewhat intriguing dishes, and that may be their only edge over Bob), so as I did at the Robinson franchise, I merely went with a burger, and it wasn't that bad, really. It's just that the grey beef, as moist as it was, conjured images of freezers, reheats, and hot lamps. 

The Smokehouse Burger was a good read on the menu with such high-falutin' fixins as Monterey Jack cheese, hardwood-smoked bacon, green leaf lettuce, tomato and  onion petals, and a spicy chipotle sauce, all of which was squeezed between a halved wheat-dusted brioche bun. It's too bad that eating it was a lesser pleasure. 

The special condiment, which I assume was a doctored mayonnaise, barely made an impact on my palate. I did enjoy the inclusion of the onion petals, something I wish was on more menus (Arby's disowned 'em for some reason), but overall, it was an awesome burger only in theory and to the eye (I almost snapped a photo since she was a beaut), yet it filled my tummy inoffensively, and it had been a long, rough day. 

BE's cole slaw is identical to KFC's: It was milky, and crunchy and was sort of like a cabbage cereal with a mild twang to it. 

A cut of their French Silk Pie concluded my chain chuck wagon meal and proved to be a definite win in the dessert column. The chocolate filling was akin to a fine mousse. The top of my cool, mildly decadent wedge of delight was loaded with a generous layer of whipped cream. The flaky, yellow crust recalled both sugar cookies and cornmeal muffins. Chocolate shavings acted as an art deco garnish. 

Hell, go somewhere else for dinner, and afterwards, head down to the farm on your bad motor scooter to give old Bob a jangle...

Or just take one of those damn good, PTA-bake-sale pies home. A whole one. Bob's wife is a wiz when it comes to sweets. 

P.S. During our visit, we were graced with excellent, conscientious service and a very cordial, accommodating staff who didn't mind that we arrived 75 minutes prior to closing (we still finished our supper and settled up with 10 minutes to spare despite not being rushed in the least). Furthermore, the entire restaurant was spotless.

P.P.S. If my review seemed disparaging, it wasn't intentional. Bob Evans restaurants are what they are. But Lordy, gimme a mom 'n pop diner over this corporatized \"country cooking\" every time. 

P.P.P.S. It's been said that breakfast is the way to go at Bob's house. Perhaps next time, if there is one, and I run across something that seems interesting on the card, I will choose accordingly."}
{"text":"Good, solid breakfast this morning.  Good service, clean facility and food was delivered quickly and hot. Good ol' reliable Bob."}
{"text":"We were desperate for breakfast on our drive back to Chicago...and then appears a Bob Evans.  woohoo!  

I can't believe some of the ridiculously unhealthy things they have on the menu - example: biscuit bread bowl with eggs, potatoes, cheese and meat in it, and hollandaise sauce on top.  Seriously.  Anyhoo, still delicious.  We had french toast and an omelet.  Both satisfied the breakfast craving.  Service was good and fast."}
{"text":"Well this is a generic chain that for some reason is super popular ?? I personally was not impressed. First of all.. it is really overpriced in my opinion. The food definitely is not bad, but for the price it should be better. I have had breakfast, soup, and salad.. and they were all fine. Nothing bad, but just nothing I was overly impressed with. Older people love it, so it's pretty crowded throughout the day. Not sure what all the hype was though"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here every few months for breakfast. I would say that the food here is inconsistent. Sometimes the food is good/hot and sometimes it's below average.  Sometimes the breakfast potatoes aren't cooked all the way, eggs are lukewarm, etc.  The service is always great but we have been hesitant to return due to the inconsistency."}
{"text":"A friend and I had breakfast here last week. 
My inlet was suppose to be tomato free, but was loaded with tomatoes. I was given another one, but by that time my friend was finished eating.
  My biggest issue was with their hash browns. They were brown all right. Totally cooked beyond recognition of any type of potato. They were hard and dry, kind of like pine needles. 
  Bob Evans should visit Denny's or Wafflehouse and see hash browns should be prepared."}
{"text":"Waste of time and money!
Hostess was rather unhappy to been working.
Eggs were ok. I ordered the new cheese hashbrowns and they were AWFUL!
Bad taste and lumpy texture. Topped with some greasy corn flakes.
  I asked for regular hashbrowns and they were just as bad on a different leve. Dried out and no taste.
  My sausage links were so overcooked, i could not even cut them, let alone eat them.
The brioche french toast was nothing to write home about regarding flavor.
They arrived cold, and to make things worse the syrup was cold also.
Coffee was good, but i was never offered a refill.
  Total bill was about $14 with tax and tip....way too much for a sub par meal.
If it was free, i would stilql complain. 
I aam not sure if this was a one time thing or a regular occurance at this location, but i will not be back."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here and the hashbrowns and eggs were drenched in oil. The country fried steak was fried to a crisp and the toast was also drenched in oil spread and burnt. The waitress did waive our coffee when we expressed our distaste for sopping hashbrowns. But we still felt stupid for eating it when we felt disgusting eating it, and stupid for paying thirty dollars for a meal that made us feel gross. We won't ever eat at this location again."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place has a low star rating! I enjoyed my time spent here with my daughter! Bathroom was neat and clean and speedy fast service! Our server was very understand of my 3 year old when she started dumping the creamer packets and jelly packets all over the table. :0) 

My daughter got the little piggy hotcakes that were freaking adorable! ( posted a picture) and I got a mini breakfast sampler of 1 egg, hash browns, and bacon.. all of this was came to less than $11.00.. can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was horrible... waited 20 mins to be seated because they didn't have anyone to clean the tables off.. then we got seated and had a rude waiter she was very unprofessional she pretty much throw our plates at us.. She took forever to refill our drinks... I know it's a hard job to wait on people but damn you should be nice because your working for tips... Never coming back here"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to write a review about this place for sometime now but I've been hoping for my experiences to get better, and they certainly did. This morning we stopped in for a quick breakfast before heading to work and to our surprise we actually had great service and great food this time. 

Once we came in for breakfast before work and the hostess seated us but no server came to our table. After waiting about 10 min we walked to the hostess stand to ask where our server was and she apologized that she forgot to tell our server that we were seated. After we ordered and got our food, we found a hair in the food. So that was a total turn off. We took a few months off from visiting this place and every other time we stopped in the service was bad. The hostess wasn't warm and greeting like a hostess should be, the service always seemed to take a long time. 

However, this time we had a great experience. Our server was awesome, she was so attentive and warm. Our food came out quick and everything tasted good with NO hair this time. So we are pretty glad we tried this place again."}
{"text":"Amazing service, staff and food! Will definitely return! Shelley was our server, and was very attentive, coffee and sweet tea are amazing as well! Eggs were cooked just as ordered! 

First time ever having sausage gravy, buttermilk biscuits and grits...apparently Canadians have been missing out!!

The desserts are to die for! The Pumpkin Supreme Pie...OMG! If you like pumpkin pie, you'll love the Pumpkin Supreme! And they sell it as a whole pie as well!"}
{"text":"My breakfast here was pretty good.  Nothing spectacular but decent for what you might expect from a chain restaurant.  They appear short staffed.  One woman was hostess, server and cashier for the entire place.  One guy in the kitchen.  The speed of service and quality of the food weren't an issue.  The issue was the way the staff handles being short staffed.  No professionalism.  The server repeatedly complained to various customers about how she was so far behind and so busy because the manager apparently didn't show up to work.  I could hear her \"sigh\" loudly throughout the restaurant throughout my entire stay and could overhear her and the other employee complaining to each other about work.   

I get it.  Boss flakes out and you start the day digging out of a hole.  We all face rough days at work.  The key is that the customer is not where the employee gets to vent frustration!   The customer wants an enjoyable dining experience without seeing and feeling tension and frustration of others.   I don't blame the server as much as I blame poor management.  Lack of support and training from a reliable leader is the downfall today.  This won't keep me from going to all Bob Evans restaurants. .. just THIS one."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would, because we never even got service. Myself, and my two young children came in around 1 on a Sunday, they were not busy. Waited approximately 3 to 4 mins to get seated. Other people around us were sat, brought drinks and were getting their order taken when I decided I had had enough. We waited almost 15 mins for a server and no one ever came to our table the entire visit. We walked out and told people standing around up front not doing anything why we were leaving and never even got an apology. Never again..."}
{"text":"Great service, menu includes pot pie, turkey w/dressing, mashed potatoes, & gravy, burgers & fries, desserts, and other appealing choices. Not quite as good as Ma's, but good anyway. Our meal arrived quickly. There's a store with sweet baked goods, and take-out is available."}
{"text":"I have only eaten there 3 times. The first 2 times, I became ill within an hour of returning home. I hadn't ordered the same item. After a few years, I went back for breakfast. The eggs were cold, the home fries were burnt & there was a hair between my 2 slices of toast. The waitress said I wouldn't have to pay and said she would inform the manager. No one really seemed to care. Never again!"}
{"text":"Above all the service here was incredible. Our waitress did an amazing job and we appreciated how hard she worked. The assistant manager came out and made sure everything was good. The food was fantastic and we loved every bite. I recommend this place without hesitation!"}
{"text":"I seriously have never had a dining experience like this before. This place should seriously be shut down. There were fruit flies all over the walls, and our server didn't come check on us once. Worst service I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast. Laurie has been my waitress a few times and I just love her personality!! Overall we've never had a bad experience at this location. Be sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"The 4 star review is strictly for the amazing hostess, Ericka & the equally as friendly & humorous Manager, Scott.  Having worked for Bob Evans many, many moons ago I am not a fan of the company itself (mainly because they're racist) but can appreciate and value the people who work at any of there locations. 

However, as pleasant as these two particular employees are, I can't say the same for our strange and somewhat \"Not all there\" waitress. My sister & I both found her behavior, although attentive for the most part, odd.  She was sweet & possibly just exhausted as we went later on in the day??? But I had ordered the cheddar/bacon pot. soup which was on the border of being cold  & not all of the potatoes were cooked. Some of them were still raw - it just didn't taste anywhere near as delicious as I remember. So since I didn't finish it we asked for a cup to take it home in but received a box instead...not sure how our waitress expected that to pan out but I left both @ the table. And the home fries didn't have any of the traditional garlic like taste to them they usually do. 

So if you're looking for home cooked food, you couldn't be more poorly educated. Bob Evans has & never will make anything homemade. Almost all of the soups, pie fillings, etc are all pre-packaged artery clogging gunk. So if it wasn't for the service this would be a 2 star review...."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since moving to Ohio. It's good down home food. Their biscuits and rolls are delicious and their menu is delicious. I have not had anything yet that didn't taste awesome. 

Their chicken broccoli alfredo is actually the best I've had. They don't skimp on the brocolli and it tastes fresh. Delicious warm comfort food. Their knife and fork sandwiches are hearty and tasty. Their stuffing is soooo good! 

The servers are extremely friendly and helpful and extremely patient. We will definitely be making frequent visits there."}
{"text":"I am giving one star because I have to. Restaurant is busy, it is a Saturday morning, but it's not slammed. I  am here with my two young daughters that are starving. We waited 30 minutes for pancakes and eggs. We didn't have a waitress take our order, I actually believe it was a manager. I watched people get sat and fed before we received our food. Our food finally came and it was obvious that it sat under a heat lamp. The eggs were cold and my sausage was hard. Irritated doesn't even explain how I feel. The girls did eat their pancakes, but the top pancake was hard from sitting under the heat lamp. If I didn't think they would have melted down, I would have returned theirs as well."}
{"text":"We came here on July 3.  It was crowded and since it was a holiday week-end some of the staff had been taken that week for vacation so they were short staffed.  Our server was handling half the dining room by herself and did an outstanding job.  I think her name was Eileen but I'm not sure.  there was a party of 10 seated behind us and I think that threw the kitchen off.   We did have to wait 45 minutes for food but we understood that the kitchen was stretched as far as it could be so we didn't really care.  Our server checked on us several times and apologized for the long wait as if it were her fault.  She was just caring and cheerful around all of her customers.   The food was average for a chain restaurant where the recipes are preset.  We didn't expect anything really special and were not disappointed.  All in all a good experience for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"With some many great places to eat breakfast in Pittsburgh, I can believe we had to end up here. However, we were in RTC, and we couldn't find anything open until lunchtime. 

The menu sucks. They keep \"reinventing\" it, but it's the same. The food is so bland, and it's often not even cooked well. If you take a look at the ingredients, it's obviously they add \"flavor\" to it in the form of lots of additives. Fresh from the farm? I think not.

It appears that this particular store is undergoing a renovation of at least the front of the store soon, but when we visited, it hadn't started yet. It definitely needs it. Don't know if it will help.

Seriously people, Eat n Park is considerably better with fresh, local ingredients and dollars that support our local economy. If you're going diner, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place, the waitresses know me by sight and it's my go to place for coffee, good coffee. I've yet to have the crape as they are usually out. Must be good. 
The hamburgers are killer and you can actually get your fries well done here."}
{"text":"First of all, my breakfast was not priced as advertised.  The meal portions were that of a concentration camp.  Absolutely not what it looked like in the picture.  I had to go up and ask for something to drink because our waitress never returned after giving us our food.  My date order the steak and egg breakfast. Her steak was inedible after she found what appeared to be an umbilical cord running throughout the entire piece of meat...which in itself looked like an intestine in shape and size. I don't know if these issues are company wide or if it is specific to this location. However, I will not be returning to spend one more dime of my hard earned money. 30$ for breakfast for two was enough of my money for a lifetime. Also, I actually downloaded and signed up for yelp for this review alone."}
{"text":"I have never had such a poorly prepared breakfast in my life my 6 year old grandson could have done better and he is not allowed to use the stove.
 
My family and i stopped here Sunday morning before going to the airport to catch a flight home I ordered a ham and cheese omelette with hash browns and a side of sausage patties. The omelette was cold with hardly any ham or cheese the hash browns where raw and the sausages where burnt black on one side and hardly cooked on the other side.

One of my cousins ordered an egg white omelette and it was so under cooked the eggs where translucent.

Since I sent back my food and told them I didn't want to reorder another family member gave me half of their turkey melt and someone decided the bread should be heavily sprinkled with cinnamon before serving it. I called to speak to the manager and was told she will call me later in the day  and no one has called me.

It's very clear management doesn't  care how bad this place is."}
{"text":"We were camping nearby and decided to get a sit-down warm breakfast. The while/multi grain pancakes are stellar! They have a hint of cinnamon, perfect!
Service was great. Manager was walking around and he topped off my soda, food came out quickly, and they were kind enough to fill up a to-go water cup for my doggie out in the car. I would gladly eat at this particular Bob Evans if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"We have visited this BE's a few times in the past.  Usually it has been pretty good.  Today was different.  One of our party wanted to try the brioche french toast with blueberries.  Ordered it as such.  The order didn't come that way; just the french toast.  Our patron thought that she had ordered wrong, and none of the rest of us knew if she did(vocalized)

I understand that times are hard, and everyone has to watch the bottom line, but I ordered their Rise and Shine breakfast, and I was thoroughly amazed at the small amount of home fries that was served with it.  Potatoes are cheap.  I was fine with the amount of eggs and bacon.  Potatoes are cheap^2.

I learned awhile ago to order scrambled eggs 'hard', to make sure that they wouldn't be soupy.  I thought that I learned to order my glass of milk 'with the meal' to not have it sit on the table nor back in the server area and get all warm before the breakfast was served. I like a nice, cold milk with breakfast. I guess from now on I need to order a milk right when the whole breakfast order gets delivered to the table, because my Fing milk was warm as it came out of the cow.

Our patron did bring up the error on the brioche, and the manager made a bill adjustment.  But, I still feel bad that anything had to be done.

Personally:  Warm milk is the downfall.

Forecast:  We will be trying MANY other breakfast venues in the area before going this one again.  Sorry, Bob, we won't be going down on the farm in this location for a long time.

The Men's bathroom REALLY need attention.  I would not have wanted to have the need to use the toilet."}
{"text":"We've always liked Bob Evans, but this location - not so much.  We keep trying it again, hoping it will be better, but I think we're going to give up.  Ordered scrambled eggs, and received a very flat egg folded up (like a crepe) - not scrambled or fluffy at all.  The breakfast sausage were tough and chewy, then the french toast - we both ordered the same, my order came out about 1/2 the size of my husband's all mutilated, and very little taste.  Every time we go to eat at this restaurant we are disappointed - not sure if it's all the Bob Evans' restaurants going down hill, but this location is a definite NO!"}
{"text":"No vegetarian options at all. So much for down on the farm. Must be a factory farm. Will not ever be coming back to a Bob Evans."}
{"text":"For what it is, it's pretty decent. Just a simple breakfast place like an IHOP, except if take an IHOP over this any day, the only this that this place did better than IHOP was biscuits and gravy and that's because They don't make that. The waiter was very nice and he worked hard for my party but the food took forever. We were there for about an hour and a half in total and didn't have any food for the first hour. Not acceptable. Not much else to say. You get a decent size meal for the price but the quality is very mediocre."}
{"text":"If you're looking for comfort food and a pleasant diner style environment be sure to check out Bob Evans. I don't visit often but I love their chicken and noodles and their pie is extra good, too.

I recognize staff there who have stayed for years so it must be s good place to work, too."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I went there with my fiancée for dinner, and the service was just ridiculous. We ordered the smokehouse burger and turkey dinner and the turkey dinner came out cold and the stuffing looked like vomit, and tasted nothing better than vomit as well. The burger was fine but nothing special. Took the server 15 minutes to get me ketchup when there's no one else they're serving. We questioned why the turkey didn't taste good and her response was \"I don't know why they don't taste that good today\" she also dipped her finger in my coleslaw while giving me a dirty look. We finished up and went to pay for our dinner via credit card and the cashier slammed the pen and receipt on the table for me to sign. Horrible service and horrible food. 1 stars because I have to give them a star to post this"}
{"text":"Went there this week and the place was busy but the waitress did her best to help everyone. The food was very good I had salsbury steak the wife had pot roast and we couldn't even eat it all received nice go home platters with a nice handbag. Wish they still had the meatloaf!"}
{"text":"Worst Bob Evans I have been to. Service was extremely slow. Sever took orders after waiting 15 minutes then came back after several minutes to take order again.  Ordered soup and salad combo which came on one small plate. Serving size was half the normal size. Server never came back until we had been done eating 15 minutes. Floor in walkway was wet and dangerous to walk on. The bathroom was filthy.  Floor was sticky from sods being spilled and not cleaned up. Toilet areas were dirty with tissue everywhere. Do not waste your time eating here!"}
{"text":"Understaffed and it's winter with the air conditioning beating down on everyone. Biggest thing is they need to hire more people."}
{"text":"This Bob Evans used to reliably provide good, fresh food in a clean and orderly environment. But the last two times we were here the food, service and cleanliness were all sub par.  A few weeks ago my wife and I went to Bob Evans in Medina for an early dinner. I ordered the meatloaf meal and we waited about 20 minutes but our meals never came. We were just about to leave when the waitress finally stopped by and informed us that they were out of meatloaf. It was 4:30 pm. I was incredulous that 1) it took them 20 minutes to figure out there was no meatloaf and 2) how could they be out of meatloaf at 4:30?  The waitress said she'd talk to the manager. About 5 more minutes went by then the manager came over to let us know that \"we found the meatloaf!\"  The manager then began to explain that he was short staffed and \"the cook misplaced the meatloaf\" and \"they don't give me enough help\". All I could think was \"I don't care, bring me my food\". But he went on and on about the trials of his job - trying to deflect responsibility to his poorly trained and short staffed employees. Let me also mention that he was wearing a filthy, disgusting shirt and pants. Anyway he said he was sorry for the long delay and mixup and that he'd credit the meal. But when the waitress brought the bill the meatloaf meal was on it. I told her the manager agreed to credit the meal. Then we had to wait some more while she went and checked with the manager again. Finally he came over and did the credit. Terrible. 

Today my wife and I went there again and"}
{"text":"It's like an Ohio classic. We got carry out, placed order online, it was ready when I arrived to pick up, still warm. I got the blueberry pancakes. You get four large pancakes filled with blueberries and topped with blueberry syrup - a little too sweet for me, but still pretty good. I wish the sauce was a bit fresher and less....corn syrupy. I also really like their sunshine skillet - so delicious. Probably will get that next time."}
{"text":"Not bad. Chicken soup is really good and just a nice dinner feel. Service is nice as well"}
{"text":"Breakfast for dinner?  Sounds delicious!  They have recently renovated this restaurant, updating the old country store display to a more modern yet tasteful and better illuminated counter display.  
I otdered the Farmers Choice breakfast with blueberry pancakes, and it was huge and fantastic!!  everything was cooked percectly!  will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Not a bad a place.  Average food, average service, average prices."}
{"text":"What really made up upset is I witness, a waitress and a waiter take French fries off customer plates before they gave it to the table . Like no that's not okay. Food was cold, out waitress was really nice - no she was not the one it witness take fries off a plate .  And bathroom was really dirty."}
{"text":"On an early Saturday morning, we were headed back from the recycling center and wanted breakfast.  I spied Bob Evans, which we have never visited and decided to give it a try.  I don't know who Bob Evans is, but he must have been a likeable fellow, because everyone working there was either gently polite or bustin' wide open friendly.
There were a ton of choices on their breakfast menu, and several were surprisingly vegetarian.  My husband and I both ordered the Harvest Omelet (I think that was the name).  It came with spinach, cheese, mushrooms, onions, and peppers, bathed in Hollandaise sauce.  I requested a biscuit with mine; he ordered a pancake.  We both chose hash browns.
Well, there was enough food on those plates for an army.  And, I received two biscuits, and he had two pancakes.  We can't eat that much!  The sauce didn't taste much like Hollandaise, but it was creamy and good.  Perfectly fried hash browns and light as air biscuits, too.
We requested a box for those leftovers and enjoyed incorporating them into our next morning's breakfast.
So, we would definitely go there again!  Thanks, Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Been coming to Bob Evans since I was a little snot....can never go wrong with it. The Sunshine skillet is to die for....they have good biscuits but I usually opt out for a side of pancakes or french toast. You can even get banana nut bread on the side if you want...all for no extra charge. 

Service is always top notch and never leave me looking for them but also not hassling to where I want to punch them. 

There Breakfast items are key....but they also have homestyle lunches and dinners as well as some bangin deserts. Easily the type of place one could come to over and over again. This just might be my fave breakfast spot ever...and i'm not afraid to fight anyone over it! (Naw, that that serious but if your ever around one...check it out)"}
{"text":"Why Why Why cant we have Bob Evans on the West Coast!!!!!!

Service is good, Food is amazing!!!!! I always get the Sunshine Skillet (open faced omelette) and a side of pancakes...always great.

Been going to B.E. for years and its always great!

I'll be back...again..and again..and again..and again..(you get the point)"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I ordered the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes. I was not impressed with the quality (I can make it better than they do) and it didn't seem worth the price.
However, the second time I went here, it was for breakfast. I had a waffle with sausage and added a side of hash browns for a few dollars extra. The food tasted really good, but I regret ordering the hash browns because they barely gave me any and it did not seem worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"Food wasn't ready for take out order like it was supposed to. Employees were just way too loud and made it weird to be in there. Manager was just as loud too. You could see how the people inside eating felt uncomfortable being there. Glad I didn't go to eat in there."}
{"text":"My family & I usually stop here on our way to the turnpike. We have had nothing but bad experiences. With the exception of the most recent  visit (9/15/17) service is poor. Food always takes long, it doesn't really matter what time of day or what day of the week you go. Food usually not hot. Definitely had our last meal here. On to a new location."}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  You can't beat attentive and friendly.  The wait staff was knowledgeable about the menu and helpful/patient with my children.  The bathrooms were clean.

While I never had to ask for a refill on any of our drinks, the food was just lacking some.  My burger was dry as a bone, and tasteless.  At least it came out hot.  My kids made out with the best food: Pancakes.  My husband was like, \"Eh.  It's edible.\"  I might come back for breakfast, but..... overall, I would say the food was very lackluster."}
{"text":"Just your typical Bob's.  I got my usual order, the farmer's choice breakfast plate and it was delicious.  The service was pretty slow for it being not that crowded, but that did not bother me too much because I was in no hurry.  I'll definitely be back here for a good solid breakfast."}
{"text":"Ordered food online and the two young men working the front counter this morning (Howard) were polite and friendly. A portion of my order included soup (@9:00am) and when I arrived he informed me that soup isn't ready until 11, and offered to substitute it out, I agreed. But they went to the trouble of getting the soup I ordered and fulfilled my original order. Great service, thank you."}
{"text":"I do not understand the negative reviews my service was excellent the place was clean one woman peat b. Trashed the place but said she had been there 5 times if you hate it so much why did you go back five times dummy. The food was delicious and hot highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bob Evans is one of the best breakfast chains I've been to.  The prices are pretty low with regular entrees ranging from $6 to $12.  The summer specials are even lower and provide more variety.  I got the border scramble omelette and the strawberry bake.  The omelette was really nice and fluffy with a kick from the jalapenos.  It came with a side of hashbrowns.  The strawberry bake was nice and $6.99 with a breakfast meat and a bowl of fruit.  It was sweet and thick with brioche as the bread and a sweet strawberry syrup with fresh strawberries. It's loud since it's busy, but that's typical for a breakfast place imo.  I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in the mood for comfort food so we thought we'd give Bob Evans a try!  I ordered the a roasted Chicken dinner with mashed potatoes, rolls, salad, and coleslaw and Hubby ordered the Meatloaf dinner!  The food was so fresh it didn't get a chance to sit under the heat lamp--which means that service was also prompt and friendly!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"You can froth at the mouth all you want about local business vs corporations. When it comes to breakfast, most local places are as clean as a bus station. This place is immaculate. Small and modern to fit in with Lakewood(not your typical barn sized hee haw you find at any highway exit). The food is pretty much like any other Bob Evans. Edible yes. Memorable no. Sometimes diarrhea is memorable. They push their specialty breads hard here. A display up front, \"grains\" motif all over the place. You know what? They make a damn good banana bread. As for corporate spots failing in Lakewood? Sure, it's happened countless times. That Five Guys came and went quicker than I could fry an egg. But 56 West was a local breakfast biz with lots of buzz. It went belly up(or sunny side up if you prefer) in a couple years. All the bars on Detroit change concepts annually. This place almost too smartly built a location right next to a ton of senior housing. Bloody brilliant if you ask me. I see them hanging around. I don't really even like breakfast all that much. The Judd Apatow of meals. Filling, good for a laugh, but ultimately pretty boring and free of imagination. All that said, I dig this here hash house. More local jobs is okay by me. Old people gotta eat too you know."}
{"text":"I was forced to listen to WNCX last night, and it reminded me of the time  Michael Stanley was at this Bobby E's. Speaking of stale, repetitive things...how bout the food?  We only went here because it was within walking distance of the crib. The crib was at the corner of I-90 and route 91(not a cultural hub). I always got eggs benedict which wasn't too awful. I gave Michael Stanley a $3 tip. He was lax in refilling coffee and hot chocolate at our table."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place. Siren the food is probably all premixed but the service is super friendly , there's no waiting, and the food tastes good. 

The biggest asset is that I can order breakfast items a late carte.. so I get pancakes and turkey sausage for $4.31!! Plus I don't have too much food that I don't want.

The bathroom was spotless.  

So, for what it is and the menu affordability, 5 stars."}
{"text":"M- I endured a early morning music festival for breakfast. The noise levels were so elevated and the music selection was so Kent I left my breakfast for a quiet car. I did alert the staff a few time of my displeasure. I was about the only customer they had at that time. The place was empty but the music was at concert level. It may be a common issue at this location. You go to Bob Evans because you know what to expect this may not be the location for an early morning crowd. It was clear that entertaining the staff was a high priority. Food marginal but I didn't do a whole lot sitting around savoring."}
{"text":"You can't beat a good ol fashion country breakfast! This place hits the spot every time. It's always clean, we rarely have to wait, the servers are friendly, and you can get in and out fairly quickly. Plus, the pancakes are what dreams are made of!! What more can you really ask for?"}
{"text":"Our waitress didn't check on us at all after bringing us our drinks. Our coffees and waters were empty until we finally asked one of the managers to see why our waitress hasn't checked up on us. She said she'd check and never returned. Our food also took a long time to come. Food was about a 6/10 service was a 4/10."}
{"text":"Friendliest hardest working staff I have ever seen! The food is just like any other breakfast place around here (eat n park) so it's not much to brag about. However, the servers there are wonderful. They really know how to take care of their customers!"}
{"text":"Arrived an hour before closing with no one in the restaurant. Our three meals came out cold. Two soups we were told had been pulled from the steam table a while before we came in. Hash browns were just barely warm. The replacement food was not much better. We did not ask for the food to be comped but were offered that. My wife and I and daughter in law love Bob Evans and were starving when we came in. We left the restaurant hungry. We were not tough on the staff but we had the distinct impression that we were a bit of an inconvenience coming in an hour before closing."}
{"text":"I like the Open-Faced Roast Beef.

They also have a magician there on Tuesday nights from 6-8 who can do tricks and make balloon twists. He also spits when he talks and puts his gnarly hands on all the little kids who walk buy.

His name is Vince Baginski. He dances and is pretty stupid.

Also, try the Potato-Crusted Flounder for some taste. And let Vince the magician touch your body in strange ways.

Love the 'signature soups'!"}
{"text":"Had the blueberry pancakes, hash browns, eggs and coffee. Only the eggs were cooked properly; the pancakes and potatoes were both undercooked. The coffee wasn't bad. I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Our experience was made awesome by the smile of our hostess named Deema, who was so kind and pleasant seating is.  The turkey sausage breakfast was only 270 calories, which I worked off on my bike ride home.  Keep hiring amazing people, Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Just left Bob Evans having hoped for a simple Thanksgiving dinner with husband and my elderly mother. Arrived at 3:15 pm and left at 6:45 with NO FOOD being served! Intolerable, inept management and unpleasant, disorganized employees! A ditzy blonde returned to our table 6 times over a three-hour period stating, \"just a few more minutes, tee hee.\" 

Here's a clue for the management: it's Thanksgiving!  Make a whole bunch of turkey and mashed potatoes!  You had the nerve to put people at tables and  then have them wait one hour and 55 minutes for rolls!?!?! We left after 3 hours without a crumb! Shame on you! And shame on us for going there. Never again!"}
{"text":"This Bob Evans is located at the northern end of Charlotte.  If you're traveling along Interstate 85, it's not right off the interstate.  To get here, you'd need to get onto I-485 Outer (the interstate loop around Charlotte) and I-77.  As long as you have GPS of some sort, it's actually easier to get here than it looks on a map.

Our most recent visit here was on December 28, 2017.  It was around 1 pm or so, which meant there was a bit of a crowd, but was manageable.  We were immediately greeted when we came in, along with being seated.  We asked to be moved to another table before sitting down since the table behind us was full and you couldn't even get into that table.  The table we were moved to was much better.  After we were seated, our server came over to our table and asked for our drink orders.  A few minutes later, the drinks came out and asked if we were ready to order.  At the time, we weren't ready just yet since there was quite a bit to choose from on the menu.  After a few more minutes, our server came back and we were ready to order.  

I ordered the Biscuit Breaded Fried Shrimp dinner entree with fries and macaroni and cheese.  I made it a dinner course for a few dollars more, which includes unlimited bread, a choice of soup or salad, and a mini-dessert.  One of the reasons I did this was because my mom wanted a cup of potato soup,  None of the soups or salads struck my fancy, so she had the potato soup that way instead (doing it this way cost less than getting the soup on its own).  For the bread, I had the banana nut bread, and I did the mini fudge sundae for dessert.

In the end, the food was good, but there were a few issues.  Some of the food didn't stay hot when it came out.  It was hard to get a hold of our server at times because they had too many tables.  Not only did they have to serve tables, but they had to bus their own tables too.  Towards the end, I was trying to figure out why my drink kept leaking on the table, and noticed a big crack up and down one side of the cup.  The burger my mom had was also not hot as it should have been as well.  I'm not sure if it sat too long, but it was definitely not what I've been used to when stopping in here when my travels take me this way.  When you go to pay, you don't pay with your server, but instead you pay at the front counter.

Given the overall experience, this place was good this time.  Given some of the issues noted above, I think a three star rating is fitting based on this experience.  It could have been the time of day or being understaffed, but I know they can do better from previous experiences.  I will still come back again when my travels take me this way, as this could have just been a one off incident or day."}
{"text":"I have been to this Bob Evans numerous times when I come home to visit my family. This last time on Memorial Day was the worst, though. When we got there we had a 10 minute wait. That wasn't bad at all, considering it was a holiday. What killed me was our server, an older lady in her late 50's. When my mom and I were sat, she came by the table quickly, and without asking how we were doing she just said, \"do you want coffee\" in a gruff voice. When she dropped off the coffee, she proceeded to tell us \"I'm busy and will be with you when I can\". The whole experience was just atrocious! I was a sever for many years, and on numerous occasions I got stressed. At the end of the day, though, you decided to be in the service industry. So suck it up and put a smile on your face. It is not the customers problem that you are having a bad day! In regards to the food, it was mediocre. We both ordered omelettes. Rather than mixing the ingredients and egg together and cooking (so as to allow the flavors to infuse together), they simply cooked the eggs and tossed the mixing a in the middle of it and folded it over after the egg was already cooked. As you can tell from this review, I am not pleased with any aspect of this dining experience, except for the company."}
{"text":"Big thanks for the delicious thanksgiving breakfast.Its fresh,worm, delicious and the service was great as always.thanks again"}
{"text":"This is the worst location I've ever been to. My carry out is never fine in time ever and it's literally a time that you choose. The employees are awful and never want to move faster than glacial place. I will never return."}
{"text":"I love Bob Evans and have been to several its locations. The food variety and quality is great, especially for the price you pay. This location had less than optimal service, which is why I gave it 4 stars. There were several servers walking by our table but only one was designated to us. While she was MIA for quite a while the other servers were pretty apathetic to our requests.
But other than that, I have no issues with this place."}
{"text":"Revisited recently on the road and I have to say that Bob's was not doing much for me. Kept it fairly healthy for breakfast but it really didn't matter, the entire place just seemed depressing and the food as well, now I know why http://r.smartbrief.com/resp/hBiJBWprbSCVeuhyCidWrnCicNDEMH?format=standard"}
{"text":"Find somewhere else to go! The servers are moody, often times disagreeing in front of you. The food sits for so long that the plates come out hot to the touch, and I don't mean warm, I mean hot! Management doesn't care; they are part of the problem as you hear them say, \"I don't know\" or, \"Well, we are not Perkins\". For what it cost now a days to go out to eat, save your money and cook at home or go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this place one star! We waited a couple of minutes to get a table at 10:30 am on a Saturday morning only to then wait over an hour for our food. We watched the wait staff stand around waiting by the kitchen to get food meanwhile, the coffee was not refilled, people stood around waiting for the cashier and people coming in were discouraged from staying by the staff working there. It was a disaster and I highly discourage anyone from going there, ever!"}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill. Soup was late to the table and served with a plastic spoon. A simple chicken tenders order took 45 minutes.  A bowl (larger size) of soup was served in a shallow bowl that meant a small portion. The kitchen was clearly in disarray. Check was not brought to the table. Many other options in Beachwood, I would stay away. Only reason this isn't a \"1\" rating is that the waiter was nice and I think felt bad."}
{"text":"We were staying right across the street and decided to try for breakfast. Wasn't anything impressive. Nothing bad but definitely wasn't anything I'd go back for."}
{"text":"Pass.

The food is covered in either grease, butter, oil, or a combination of all three. The bread was soaked in bitter, the bacon dripped with grease, and the steak was veiny, disgusting, and unable to even be cut. The coffee was bland and watered down. I'd rather go anywhere else for breakfast, or just stay home."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful waitress. Service was wonderful in all ways. Four of us ordered with two checks, and all went well. Food was hot and delicious. Clean. We finished at 10 a.m. The line waiting for seating was out the door."}
{"text":"Went to this Bob Evens last weekend because I was in the area on Saturday and my goodness, it was great! Our waitress was so kind and helpful. They introduced a new brunch menu so clearly I had to try. I got the pot roast hash, my boyfriend got the steak and egg and we both loved our meals. We also got the new candied bacon that it's basically beef jerky dipped in syrup and it was heaven. From a marketing stand point, they definitely did a bit of rebranding to make it more trendy and I think it was a hit. They use mason jars for their cups and elevated their menu options. Def would recommend if you're in the mood for a lot of homey food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"First time I came here and a couple other Bob Evans I've gone seem to forget the scallions on the \"Farm Favorite\".  
So I asked the waitress who brought me some in a bowl. Then I cut into my omelette to see there wasn't any Swiss cheese. I told the waitress, who then said \"let's make this whole thing over for you\". 
That was awesome and it came out quickly and she apologized. 

That's taking care of an issue and great service!"}
{"text":"Kinda pricey for a bob Evans, but otherwise I'd say it's pretty much like every other Bob Evans I've ever bene to. If you haven't been to a Bob Evans, picture a denny's but without the self aware attitude and maybe a little more expensive. If you haven't been to a denny's why are you even reading this. go to a denny's At any rate, not a bad place to get breakfast if you drove through the entire night from denver the day before and are stopping outside the rock n roll hall of fame after sleeping in your car outside of a hotel for an hour."}
{"text":"Our waitress made this visit a solid five. Shea is friendly, helpful and a rockstar. The ample serving of blueberry pancakes was a hit at our table. Good service and good food today"}
{"text":"We came to this bob Evans the other day and it was by far the worst experience we've had. We got seated immediately, but it went downhill from there. After we all sat down, we waited at least 15 minutes for the waitress to come over to get some sort of order. So we order our drinks and our food since we were sitting there for 15+ minutes before someone came over. The waitress left and we waited for at least 10 minutes for her to bring the drinks over. About 5 minutes later, she came back to confirm our orders (like you haven't put them in yet?!). We then got our assorted breads 10 minutes later and when we asked for more, she didn't bring any. About half an hour after ordering, we finally get our food. It was meh. The biscuits and banana bread were the best part. A long while into eating, we asked again for bread and for drink refills. We never got them. Then 10 minutes later, the waitress asked if we were still doing okay (?? We literally asked for more bread and drinks 10 minutes ago and never got them). Worst. Restaurant. Experience. Would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I stayed next door at the Microtel Inn this past weekend for my friends' wedding and since continental breakfasts are usually lame and the fact I had to help decorate for the wedding prior to being in it, I wanted something more than just a bagel...so off I ventured next door to this Bob Evans.

When I walked in, I was greeted by the manager and I told him I only had an hour time-frame due to a wedding rehearsal to attend to by 10am. He immediately assured me that would be \"no problem\" and that they would get me in and out quickly.

A waitress came over very shortly after and got me some coffee and then took my order. My friends whom I was sharing a room with decided to join me and she took their order and got drinks to them just as fast as she did me. Our food was out in no time and was great!

I left a 50% tip (not a big deal considering my bill was $12) as a \"thank you for accommodating me\" note. 

A Bob Evans is a Bob Evans ya know, but they made my morning quick and rush free and I truly appreciate when people bend-over-backwards to help you out.

Definitely would hit this place up again if I was in the area and wanted breakfast."}
{"text":"I went to this location with a friend and it was just terrible!! The waitress was so bad didn't even come to are table and when she finally did all she said was do u know what you want yet. She went to other tables but wouldn't come to ours. She wasn't friendly and didn't feel welcomed at all. My friends coffee got cold within 10 min so it wasn't hot to begin with and the waitress didn't come back to even check."}
{"text":"My order was wrong and when I asked for it to be corrected both the waitress and the Mgr seemed completely apathetic.  Then when we went to put the kids in the car the servers huddled up to complain about all the customers and how crappy the manager was. When they noticed me standing there 5hey scattered, LOL I only wish I could have had my Camara on video because it was truly a laughable situation."}
{"text":"What's funny is all the bad reviews on this place are hidden. My husband is living cross county and has attempted to come to this location 3 times. Each time gets worse than the last. Management needs to seriously look at what the workers are doing, especially with getting people seated and served within a timely manor. You aren't in downtown Pittsburgh with a ton of customers, so stop treating your customers like crap, especially your veterans who have to live away from their families for long periods of time and rely on unfortunately coming to establishments like this one and getting crap to no service!"}
{"text":"Today is Memorial day so we expected it to be a little crowded. Upon getting there the entire wait area was full. We were told a 10 minute wait as we would have went elsewhere with 2 hungry and restless toddlers. It was about a 25 minute wait then another 10 once we got seated. When they took us back, more than half of the restaurant was open so it was confusing as to why we waited so long with so many open tables and booths. They didn't seem short staffed but there was a lot of hustle going around.
Waitress was kind of ditzy: had a hard time taking our order and came back several times with questions (you wanted eggs, right? What did you want to drink again?). I'm sure she was super busy so we weren't upset but she wrote it all down. With a lot going on, we tried to be understanding.
Food came out as expected. I asked for over hard eggs and ended up with sunny side up, but otherwise food was good. Had a rough time getting drink refills, but again, it was sort of busy so not entirely her fault.
Coffee was lukewarm but we didn't send it back due to the amount of people and time it took to get everything.
Checkout was easy and fast. Staff was friendly but distracted. Not a bad place: your standard Bob Evans. 
Bathrooms were lacking in cleanliness. Mens room was out of paper towels and women's room had dirty floor and smelled awful. Sinks were pretty bad too."}
{"text":"Ask for Sally's tables...she's an excellent, caring waitress.  The Broasted Chicken came out hot and delicious.  The Cole Slaw was superb.  Even the French Fries came out hot.  :)  I would not hesitate to visit this location again.  The down home hospitality and Excellent Cooking would have made Bob Evans Proud!"}
{"text":"The food is okay but the steak is dry and if you get over medium eggs there is like NO yoke. Some of the employees don't seem to happy to be here but I wouldn't want to be working so early either. So I will come here again but be careful with what you order I guess."}
{"text":"We have gone there as a family at least four times since they have opened. It was bad on our first visit, but we thought we'd give them more chances to improve after their initial opening. Nothing has changed...! The food is often cold, the portions are smaller than other Bib Evans (which we generally like), the service is slow and their uniforms not clean, the restaurant is often not clean, and they are often out of food. This may be the first Bob Evans in history to go out of business!"}
{"text":"Went to bob Evans yesterday morning and well...
* server was a bit unattentive.
* a bit to crowded for my taste.
* sausage gravy tasted like a microwave recipe from Aldis.
* coffee was good but so is dunkin donuts..."}
{"text":"Bob Evans, for me (raised in California) is comparable to Marie Calendars.

The food is ok, the service was only ok.  The decor was inviting and bright.

Meatloaf was very well advertised, however, I did not care for it at-all.   The pancakes, if you have an IHOP nearby, go to that instead.   Breakfast items I ordered were the sausage patties with scrambled eggs and bacon too.   All of it was just your regular typical low-end stuff.   Stick to Denny's or if you have, IHOP is better.   Better yet, go to a real restaurant like First Watch.

The chicken fried steak was awesome and very well made.

The potatoes on the breakfast plate could definitely have been cooked longer to develop a better taste and texture.

I finished my water literally about 10seconds after it was put down, but it didn't get refilled till about 15 mins later after the food was brought out, although the two nearby tables did get better service.

Not worth a revisit."}
{"text":"Little crowded but to be expected. Smelled great, clean, friendly staff. We were seated pretty quickly and got our drinks. There was a small screw up with one order but an easy prompt fix. Waitress sweet and knowledgeable.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Really terrible service of mediocre food. Ambiance of crying child at nearby table makes this a place to avoid."}
{"text":"Restaurant was moderately busy, and I think our server was new.  We waited about 20 minutes after we were seated.  He was not sure of the sides and other servers noticed he was having a hard time, disappointed that they don't work as a team to make a better experience for the customers. From the time we were seated until the time we payed the bill it took over an hour  and that was ordering, waiting for the food, waiting for the check."}
{"text":"Food was good, but I came for the Wifi, I wanted to do some work while I waited for breakfast. The wifi didn't work, and it was never fixed after I told them it wasn't working."}
{"text":"This is the store that made me fall in love with Bob Evans. The large menu is a bonus can't go wrong with having alot to choose from. I love the candied bacon mmm good. I ordered 2 because I couldn't believe how good it was. I gotbthe steak and eggs and everything was amazing this is hands down the best breakfast place I've been to havnt tried much on the rest of the menu but only been a few times will be back to try other things."}
{"text":"I really like there food. I usually get steak and eggs and it's always cooked how I ask the service is always fast and friendly. The store seems clean too and everyone seems happy to be there the candied bacon is awesome."}
{"text":"Just got off the phone with a general manager. I explained my situation and he was very understanding. I told him I only wanted to inform him of my experience so that this does not happen to someone else at this location. I am not looking for free food or coupons - and would not accept any. I simply want this kind of bad service to not be acceptable, and these young folks who think this kind of behavior is acceptable to be taught otherwise. As an employer, I know the lack of true service and pride in one's work has been lost and it's a daily struggle to educate the young. I wish this location the best of luck and hope that this young lady can learn what it means to reap the benefits of hard work and caring about others, not just one's self."}
{"text":"Normally I think this place is ok. I don't think you should not go here because of this review. However, it is important to know what you can expect. If something is 86ed there is no apology and no manager visit. I don't expect that a servers attitude should be poor after telling you they don't have something that You ordered. The server actually said \"seriously\" to me after after I questioned the issue. 

Mistakes can happen and will happen I get that!! This is why the recovery is so important you could have fixed this whole thing with a simple I'm sorry. 

Here is my bacon pic below

The bacon is over cooked 
The hash browns are cold 
The eggs are runny and I asked for them well done
Toast perfect"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. Restaurant was very crowded.
Food came out cold. A bowl of oatmeal a side of bacon and a cup of coffee 11.00. Don't eat here it's very expensive"}
{"text":"Sunday July 10 2016 around 11 AM.  The restaurant was busy but there were a few empty tables around us.  For a two person breakfast order we waited 55 minutes before being served.  There were three tables that all received their food before we did and they were not even seated by the time we placed our order.  The hashbrowns were burnt on the exterior and uncooked in the middle.  The table was covered in a film of grease.  I assume that the cleaning staff wipes the tables with wet rags which in time only smears the grease around.  I began to write 'CLEAN ME' in the table grease using my finger but my girlfriend got embarrassed so I stopped at 'CLE'.  I do not believe we will go back since there are dozens of places in the area to get breakfast on clean tables where you don't have to wait hours for the hens to lay new eggs."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and they were 100% opposite of my experience.

First I must preface this by saying it has been years since a server didn't mess something up in my opinion.  My server during this visit was Linda.  She gave me a choice of where to sit and eventually put me in a booth (table 61/1 ?).  I told her I already knew what I wanted and she was ready to take my order.  Some servers insist on giving you a menu and coming back in a few minutes; she did not.  I ordered two eggs scrambled, hash browns, sausage links, whole wheat toast.

She came back with my drinks (coffee and water) fairly quickly.  The food was out a little bit after that.  Overall I gauge the food around 4/5 stars because it was a bit on the greasy side.  I would advise the kitchen staff that they can make the same dishes by decreasing the amount of oil they cook with.  The hash browns were cooked perfectly though with just enough browning and nothing burnt.

Linda was around multiple times and asked to refill the coffee.  That is a major pain point for me when they fill your cup without asking and it jacks up the cream/sugar/coffee ratio and you have to redo the entire cup to get it just right again.  Linda knew not to do that.  If management reads this I would put her in charge of training the waitstaff.  I eat out all the time everywhere I go and Linda was flawless in my opinion.  Due to that I will be coming back here for breakfast when I am in Pittsburgh.

Total bill after tax was $10.96."}
{"text":"Food was average but waited a long time for it. It was warm but not hot. Sure hope service improves. We waited a good 15 to twenty minutes for soup and salad? Not sure if problem was in the kitchen or because server was bussing tables."}
{"text":"A solid breakfast choice if you are in the area. While I can't recall anything being particularly amazing, nothing is really bad either. With the low prices, you can spend the money you saved on buying something nice in Marketplace Mall."}
