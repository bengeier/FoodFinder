{"text":"Extremely disappointing. We had to leave our baby's stroller out on the busy street. You aren't allowed to touch the cats and the whole attitude and atmosphere is off-putting, as though the staff doesn't want you there."}
{"text":"Kittens are the best!  ^_^
I like playing with kitties but not owning them.
So, I like cat cafes for this reason.

For the price of a tea, you can hang out with a few kittens as the sleep and run around.
The big one is angry and he will claw your face off.
Other than that, the other cats are happy and seem to be well treated by the owners.

A fun place to visit. :)"}
{"text":"I was literally looking for a place to get coffee, happened to stumble onto this one with a friend, stepped in ready to pay just about any price for their drinks, and made the apparent mistake of reaching out to pet a cat. \"Don't touch!\", the owners snipped at me.

Walked out and went to Thobors Boulangerie, which was excellent. No cats there, but at least you're allowed to touch the moelleux."}
{"text":"Weird place. Too many rules. I needed to buy my toddler a beverage as well as my own in order to come in. Also you Cannot stay more than an hour, even though I wouldn't willingly stay more than 5 mins. The place needs normal sized furniture so an adult can sit and drink their coffee, all seating is on the floor or very low to the ground chairs . That being said my son absolutely loved being around so many cats."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0

Stumbled upon this cat cafe which is run by Koreans.

The way it works is that you order a drink and then you would be allowed to stay there for an hour to play with the cats (there are about 5 cats in total, some are actively playing while others are sleeping). It is basically setup like a daycare for cats. 

A nice place to visit if you are in the area. Drinks are alright and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I unfortunately came at a really bad time because the cats were all puckered out and alot of them were sleeping. The cats that were awake however weren't that interactive with people other than the owners of the cafe. I ordered a hazelnut latte and it was ok.

The maine coone is a very very grumpy cat but I think it's just me but I love tsundere cats! So that cat didn't really bother me, my friends didn't like it because it would scream at people it didn't like or if people touched it anywhere besides its head. The only other cat that kind of wanted to play with me and my group of friends was a white based kitty with orange and black spots I think ??? 

Idk this review is extremely long overdue because I went back in October last year 2k16. The cats only started to play when the owners interacted with them which made me really jealous. I'm hoping to come back soon however to give this place another try earlier in the day when they're not as tired and give a better review."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I took my 10 year old daughter here after school last week and  the woman working there was so shockingly rude. She was bossy and aggressive and angry and just plain disrespectful.  The cats there are not even friendly, I can't blame them considering their owner. I will never return here."}
{"text":"It saddens me to write this as I was looking forward to checking this place out! 
I haven't written a yelp review in years but this experience was so short and so bad I had to.

We walked in and the first thing instead of 'hi, how are you' was 'you need to buy something'. 

This was before we were there for less than 1 minute. Fair IF we had been lingering for a time, but come on, how unwelcoming can you be? 

It also smelled like my granny's basement after the cats had their way."}
{"text":"As the name implies, this is a coffee shop with cats walking around. Perfect for those who like to pet cats but don't want to take care of them. Decent selection of drinks to choose from. Soy milk available for extra charge upon request. Friendly staff, friendly cats with one exception!

Overall an interesting concept and a great experience, worth checking out."}
{"text":"Cute place! I liked how it was all open and not as crowded as TOT. You must buy a drink before playing with the cats but it is a very reasonable rule, they need to make money somehow. As for the cats, they were okay, preferred to kept to themselves and didn't really seem interested in the toys until one of the owners brought out all the treats. There was 1 grey main coone that was quite angry and swatted everyone lol, if you have kids be careful!"}
{"text":"The premise is that you order a drink and you get to stay for 1 hr to play with the cats.  The drinks are okay but the cats are very cute.  Some are friendly and some prefer to sleep. 

These cats belong to the owner. There's a list of rules you are supposed to follow, basic common sense to keep both human and cat calm and safe. 

The space is open with simple furnitures and cushions for humans to sit on, but it's primarily built for cat's comfort. The ventilation must be great coz the place doesn't smell at all. 

I do find it their merchandise choice odd. There are assortments of pet products from Korea, which does suit the place... but then there are also random products with pictures of Korean celebrities on them, as well as jewelries  (for human) and cute stationary....as if they can't make up their minds on what to sell, and makes me wonder if the business can stay afloat with just selling coffe/tea...However, I don't know if ppl ever pay attention to the displays with so many cats to play with..."}
{"text":"Nice place, I came with low expectations and had a pleasant visit. 

Owners can be a bit abrupt in dealing with customers, You have to sanitize your hands and buy a drink before interacting with the cats(and read the rules). This is a business and they have to pay rent, hydro and vet bills. A few people came in off the street with kids and were told to \"read the rules, Sanitize your hand and buy a drinks\".

There are only a couple of seats in the front area and that is where most of the cats were sleeping. I had a coffee that was pretty good. After sitting for a few minutes the cats started interacting with us.

The owners really seem to love their cats and come out to play with them. I would definitely come back for a visit."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a cat cafe and it lived up to my expectations! I was a bit worried because of the reviews but we were able to play with all the cats. The drinks were pretty good (not overpriced) and we had no issues with the owners like people said. It's a very good deal since they don't make you pay to get in. The cats are very playful and affectionate (except for one, but it is noted on the board). They have a lot of toys in a basket that are free for you to use to play with the cats. 

When we went, they gave us free phone ring holders! They gave it out for their anniversary and it was supposed to be one per group but the lady gave us one each. If I lived closer I would definitely visit more often. I think this place deserves better reviews!!"}
{"text":"This is a truly weird cat cafe. The owners watch over each stroke you give a cat, and correct your interactions. You can only stroke a cat with a flat hand. You can't touch them for too long. There's a long note on the walk that includes the following \"Please do not pat the cats too much.\" 
On a positive note, you are simply required to buy a drink each, and allowed to stay an hour, without any additional fee. Because all these cats are the pets of the owners, they have every right to be protective of them. This isn't the ideal venue for small children, and we felt a bit like intruders in someone's small living room. But it's a fine way to spend an hour in the presence of some cute felines."}
{"text":"The cafe is an eclectic mix of gift shop (selling KPop merchandise, cat toys, those beaded bracelets that you can get at convenience stores...) and cat cafe. You quickly get over the odd mix by none other than...the cats! They are soooo cute! We came like an hour before closing time so they were all tired out and want to sleep but they still interacted with us. The cats were also very intelligent - one cat in particular  (younger white cat named Lily) actually listened to me when I told her to \"go again\" on the cat wheel (see video). The cats quickly got over their sleepiness when I bought some treats. As soon as I've finished paying, I found myself surrounded by cats - great way of getting tired cats to interact with you! 

One thing that I wasn't too pleased about was the pushiness of the owners. I reached down to pet one of the cats but I was told rather sternly to read their guide prior to interacting with them. Communication is something that the owners should work on.

Overall - great experience! Loved playing with the cats and we were not given any time limits interacting with them (which was great!) Definitely down for coming back again!"}
{"text":"Place was ok. Caramel macchiato was good. There are rules in place to make sure the cats aren't bothered, which I totally agree with, but considering cats sleep 14-20 hours a day, not petting the cats when they are sleeping means you're sitting at a mini table with 5 cats sleeping. Cats didn't really interact unless the owner started playing with them. 

The stuff for sale is super tacky. 

There is one cat that doesn't really like to play or be pet, which is a little strange in a place where people go to pet cats. 

I did notice that at least 2 of the cats were not spayed/neutered. Not sure about the others as I wasn't actually checking. One of the cats was not there because she had just had a litter of kittens. I feel having unaltered male and female cats living together is irresponsible. The gestation period for cats is just over 2 months, so there is the potential for numerous pregnancies. There are already more than enough kittens needing homes, so I found that disappointing."}
{"text":"This was a nice place. We liked it more than the other cat cafe in town, Tot Cat Cafe or whatever it was called. The cats aren't behind glass or anything, they're just milling around in the space, so you can just play with them while having your coffee. The coffee was fine, by the way, but you're really coming her to play with some cats, and these ones were rather cute.
Mostly though, I just stood around while my wife played with them, cuz I just don't like cats very much (okay, I HATE them!!!), and took photos of them. The café could probably use a few more pieces of furniture for humans; was hard to find a place to sit."}
{"text":"I echo many of the comments on here as my experience with the horrible people who run this place is similar. Walked in for the first time, feeling good because there were many cute cats around. Reached down to say HI to one with a scratch on the head or whatever, and a woman aggressively got between me and the cat, forbidding me to touch the cat until I'd bought something. Still stunned from that, I was directed to the counter where another surly woman looked at me me hostilely, silently waiting for me to place an order. I just said \"I've changed my mind\", and walked out. Please don't support these people by buying something there. If you want to support a cat cause, do so elsewhere."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Less busy then the other cafe in Toronto which is nice! The owners were very friendly and yes there are a lot of rules but they're just there to make sure nothing goes wrong :) I'll be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Dainty cafe with a few drink selections. If you follow the rules, you'd be able to enjoy interacting with the cats. Treats are the key to getting the cats to come close to you. For an extra $2, I think it was well worth it. Definitely a good place to de-stress on a weekday."}
{"text":"Maybe I can remove my coat before you rudely demand my order?

These business owners should learn that their customers should be respected as we are spending our money there.

Such lack of self awareness that they actually gave me a customer loyalty card. 

Nope. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Super cute cats, and decent drinks with adorable designs, however extremely brusque staff/owners who border on just plain unwelcoming. (Do they even wanna be in business?)

During my visit, the owners accosted 2 families with their militant purchase rules as soon as they walked in. I understand it's not PJs Petstore and that they need to make money somehow, but they really need to reconsider how they approach first timers who visit the shop. Maybe move the bar/cashier to the front to properly greet ppl *before* they step in if it's so important? Or have someone stay near the front door and be ready to explain the rules? I'd read reviews before coming, so I already anticipated the staff attitudes, but ppl who aren't prepared for that will be very put off. I personally witnessed the owner literally yank a chair full of cats away from an elderly woman who was SO excited about seeing cats again, because she didn't immediately purchase a drink and read their rules. :( 

Anyway, very cute and chill cats. Owners, not so much."}
{"text":"My first cat cafe and I never wanted to leave! The owners have a bad rep on here so I was a bit hesitant to visit but I went with some friends and they're not the least bit rude. They have signs and rules so follow them. It's easy to, and when you don't, obviously they have to enforce it a bit more stricter. They were very friendly - at one point the owner placed a cat on a customers shoulders! In other words, if you're do as told, they're very friendly. 

Drinks were also really good - espresso drinks can come iced or hot and they also serve non-caffeinated drinks like hot chocolate. 

Cats were also lovely. Most of them were asleep and some had appeared out of nowhere (good at hiding!) It's true they don't interact with you much but some cats like Lily and Elsa liked walking around and being petted. 

All in all very good experience! I'm dying to go again! This place doesn't deserve such a low review!"}
{"text":"The owners need to urgently attend a customer service course!! We arrived and they were assembling a table so I asked if they were open and one of the owners rudely answered \"the sign says we are open\". They are not friendly or inviting and they barely said a word other than ask us to purchase a drink as soon as we got inside. The cats are nice, a couple of them are friendly but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the owners can be pretty abrupt when interacting with customers which kind of ruins the experience. The drinks are also not great, so it's best to just get something inexpensive like tea.

The cats are all super cute, but the Maine Coon (the big one) can be grumpy and try to scratch you so I'd recommend staying away from him."}
{"text":"The place is not so big. There are 6 cats. I feel that the cafe should have more cats. The restaurant is big enough to host 10-12 customers not feeling so crowded. Most of the seats are on the floor, which is fairly inconvenient because there is not much space to put down your drinks or snack. Their coffee is so so. Design of the coffee cup is cute. I would prefer they have more snack choices so you can actually sit down have a something and relax, enjoy fun time with the cats.

Many parents bring their kids in to play with the cats everyday, and the cats can get tired depending on the time of the day. Although they stated that there is an hour limit, they don't actually clock you. We did stay over an hour and no issue. In my opinion, the owners are fairly flexible. If the cafe is not so busy, you can probably stay a longer.  However, customer should also be considerate when the restaurant is busy, at the end they still need to make a living."}
{"text":"Not a great place to go if you actually want to pet the cats. They don't want to go near anyone unless your the owners. 

The owners are so rude, first thing when we walked in they yelled at use about following there rules. First off we did not know the rules since it was out first time here. Secondly they were not welcoming at all. Sitting around they have made sure I had followed the rules and keeping and eye on me. I do not appreciate the fact that I would not respect there rules when I did. 

There rules are so strikes that it does not create a comforting environment for people to come to. 

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a truly unique cafe space in Toronto, and I have nothing but respect and admiration for the cafe owner, who clearly makes it a priority to ensure the cats here are happy, healthy, and safe. The rules are in place for a good reason--I've seen ignorant / loud people pursue the cats aggressively when it's clear they want space. So I totally support the owners stepping in and reminding patrons of the rules--otherwise I'd be worried that the cats were more stressed out. I've visited several times and I find the owners to be friendly but firm with the rules, and I think that's just fine. 

By the way, the drinks here are wonderful--the latte I had last week was nothing less than perfect! Everything is clean and every time I visit, there are different toys set up for the cats to play with. Such a pleasure just to sit quietly, relax and enjoy. It's a fairly quiet space, albeit with fun pop music and the occasional swishing of cat toys. 

On a final note, I don't understand the people complaining they can't pet the cats here. OF COURSE the cats here don't want hundreds of people petting them all the time--it's stressful and scary, especially when the people act like clumsy, loud ogres. Poor kitties. However...If you buy treats and remain calm and quiet, the cats will be all over you in no time."}
{"text":"The biggest disappointment of our whole trip! 
Do not go here- especially with children! The owners are cranky, rude and even vindictive - they  should not be in business with animals!! 

I have never written a destructive yelp review, but I feel compelled to tell my story: 

I was visiting my hometown Toronto, from Vancouver with my son. 
My 3 year old loves cats and we had previously had a wonderful time at the cat cafe in Vancouver (Tinseltown mall if you're ever visiting!) 
He had been primarily looking forward to this more than all other plans. So we arrived first thing. 

As we walked through the double doors we were \"greeted\" by two vigilantes who told us that we hadn't closed the door fast enough and that I needed to hold my son's hand (have they ever been around a toddler?), for which I promptly apologized and then did.

Feeling unwelcome I figured I ought to purchase some items right away (per the many ridiculous printed signs!). 
When I went up to the counter to order I was scolded by the younger vigilante for not following the rules. (My mother is right beside him was my first thought?) 
Instead I calmly suggested to the the woman that she \"give my son a chance, I realize he's small but he's very experienced and gentle with cats\". This didn't go over as well as I'd hoped. They followed our every move. 

In hopes of reclaiming the atmosphere for my son's sake, I tried again to buy snacks to ease the tension, thinking we could still prove our conscientiousness. 
Again the woman barked something about rules. 
I calmly said: \"we've been looking forward to seeing your cafe but you're not making us feel very welcome here\". 
She uttered something about the cats not being here for our entertainment, but then when I took out money to pay for snacks she said \"we are not beggars\". 

At this point my mother and I were frustrated and realized we couldn't salvage the experience. We had to leave. 

My sensitive 3year old had tears welling in his eyes.
I explained that they were just having a bad day and that we could still watch two cats sunbathing in the front window. This was fun for about 30 seconds, until one woman noticed and forcefully scooped both cats out of the window.  (Insane, right?!) 

Never have I experienced such pettiness and heartlessness, aimed at a small child (by an adult!) 
Not to mention her disregard for her own cats. I can only imagine how they are treated behind the scenes. 

From their behaviour, these two people have demonstrated they should NOT work with
A) animals
B) children
C) customers 

However, I'm sure Corrections Canada could use some new team members!?! 

*Silver lining: 
We walked up the street 2 blocks north, to Mable's Fables bookstore. It just so happens that Mable is a gorgeous tabby cat! We enjoyed the relaxed environment, bought a couple books and interacted with Mable! I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"TOT cafe closed down(temporarily) so I found this place. Compared to TOT cafe, this cat cafe is cleaner and more comfortable, the cats roam around the entire store. You only need to order one drink (~$5, it's a few dollars cheaper than TOT). The vanilla ice latte is good. The cats only wanted my treats lol. They seem to liven up and follow you when treats were involved. But they seemed friendlier than the \"orphan\" cats at TOT, when I reach out to pet some of the TOT cats they would do that flexible cat bending thing and slide. These cats are owned by the store owners so maybe that's why they're not as unfriendly. 
Beware of Coco the fatty. She kept begging for treats. There was an interesting one with a grumpy face and snagged tooth. It would watch you from far, wanting a treat but then you approach and it runs away lol"}
{"text":"1 star for poor customer service. Unfortunately, I will not be giving this place my business because the owners are unprofessional and I was not comfortable. It's a shame"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!  DO NOT VISIT!  This was a terrible experience.  The owners are very rude, unwelcoming and inhospitable!  They should not be in any business that deals with the public/customers. I certainly hope the cats are treated better than the clients. So many bad reviews.  I wish I had read them prior to going.  I would have stayed home."}
{"text":"Did you just say another cat cafe??? Anything cat and I'm there. My friend introduced and recommended me to this place after she visited a couple of times before. It's run by a mother and daughter team of Koreans. How it works is that you buy any drink ($3+) and you can interact with the cats. They have about 6 cats at various ages, and unlike TOT, they own the cats, which is a very interesting take. I would never let random strangers play with my cats, but, here you go. LOL. They both care about their animals a lot and they love them back as well. To anyone docking off points because they're not adoptable, why is that even an issue? They can choose whatever they'd like to do and the business model they like.

Drink was alright quality, but I'm here for the cats. They each had their own personality and were a lot of fun. I feel like the owners really need to sort out their rules and what they expect from their customers. I read some of the reviews, and they're saying restrictions that weren't imposed on us, and I think it's just because it's a learning process and depending on the situation. There's definitely room for improvement to perfect their business. They also sell little Asian gadgets and pet clothing on the side, but it was quite expensive for my tastes.

Unfortunately this cat cafe is very far from me, but if I was in the area I would definitely swing by to play with the kittens and the magnificent but grumpy Maine Coone. :) They are a rather new business and juggling animals, opinionated customers, and business together can be a nightmare and I would give them some slack."}
{"text":"Meow Cat Cafe is located on Mount Pleasant, about a 8-10 minute walk away from Davisville subway station (or if you want to catch the bus to make your walk shorter you could do that too). 

My boyfriend and I decided to walk to the cafe on a nice spring day on a Saturday afternoon. Upon arrival, we went into the cafe (there was a gate you had to open after going through the main door), and you are greeted by the friendly owners. You make your way to the counter to order a drink. Although the prices are not cheap, you must buy a drink in order to stay at the cafe. Even though we went on a weekend, the cafe was not busy and there were other customers sipping their drinks and playing with the cats. It is stated that there is a one hour limit but we went around 4:30pm (cafe closes at 6pm) so we stayed for a little over an hour.

In total there are around 6-7 cats, all of them are the owner's cats. After you pay for your drink you must put your name down and read the cat rules. Everyone followed the rules and respected each other's space.

In comparison I've also been to the TOT cat cafe in Toronto near College/Spadina and I prefer the Meow Cat Cafe. Overall the vibe is friendlier and more welcoming. The whole cafe is decorated with cat pictures and cute cat items which makes the place feel more personalized. Staff are friendly and the location has less foot traffic which made the cafe not overcrowded with customers."}
