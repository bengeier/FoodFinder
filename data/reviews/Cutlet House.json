{"text":"We had a Teambuy coupon for this and they wouldn't accept it on our mobile device.  That cost us quite a lot of time and we had to actually call Teambuy to get it resolved.  A huge pain.

The food: meh.  My wife and her sister found it lacking, and I did as well.  Considering the neighbourhood and its competitors, this place can't last.  I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"I always come here to eat Tonkatsu, its the one place where it will always be crispy and delicious. The staff is always friendly but their English is not the best, but I believe the food is worth it."}
{"text":"The Cutlet House is one of a a number of super-cheap Korean restaurants along the Koreatown strip.  Lunch specials can be had for as low as $4.50, with dinner items in the $6-10 range.

I had the bulgogi, which was a huge portion served on a sizzling hot plate with miso and rice.  It was $8.50, and the beef was fantastic.  The service was a bit slow, considering it wasn't all that busy.  Their grasp of the English linguo is limited.

The restaurant is clean(er) and new(er) than others on the strip.  It's totally safe to bring white people here.  Rejoice!"}
{"text":"Don't be tricked by these other two foolish reviews. Cutlet House is mediocre at best. 2.5 star. It's always empty for a reason.

They have the worst kimchijiggae I've ever tried. So don't order that. Banchan is subpar.

Overall, this place is still cheap with good value. But in Korea Town, you have PLENTY of options that offer the same, so please go somewhere with better food. (Tofu Village, Buk Chang, Sunrise House, Seoul Restaurant)"}
