{"text":"I been away from the place for a few years but went twice last long weekend for dim sum.  We had a large group so this was an easy choice


It is great if you want a mid priced/ cheap  and good dim sum.  This is not comparable to casa Victoria,   skyview or casa imerperial. 


Most of the lower prices dim sum  closed in scarbough in the last few years

We had    

Shrimp dumplings  3/5
Durian tart     5/5
Beef  rice noodle 4/5
Shrimp rice  4/5
Fred squid  3/5

Honey beef ribs  4/5
Beef   balls  4/5
Lotus leaf rice 4/5






Chairs are hard but bare able.    Nothing fancy and bathriom are typically chinese in cleanlyness."}
{"text":"Very authentic but also very salty and spicy.

We ordered the crispy spicy beef.  very generous portion of 'deep fried beef'.  This one was just right.
The cold appetizer of spicy beef tripe and tendon came with lots of chili oil and you can definitely taste the 'ma' (sesame oil) and the chili.  
The cold appetizer of smoked fish was good but we did not like that it came with sauce.  We like it dry with no sauce.
The water cooked beef was so spicy we were able to taste only one spoonful each.  Lots of peppercorn such that it was too bitter.  Although as a leftover, it tasted fine today.
The spicy beef noodle was ok but the broth could be better.  
Overall, different from everyday Chinese but you need to like spicy food.
Maybe next time, we will balance the meal with someone of the non-spicy items."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 dishes. Meat was not fresh out of 3.
\"Fu Qi Fei Pian\" had that strange sour taste which is not usual."}
{"text":"This is a pretty local place to have dim sum until about 2:30pm everyday, and their Szechuan menu anytime.  It's clean and relatively large with booths for 4 with wooden chairs and tables around the walls, round tables on the floor and 2 rooms with large tables. Busy on weekends.

Many of the dim sum items are good, such as the BBQ (or Shrimp or Donut Stick) steamed rice noodle rolls, fried squid, fried shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, regular dumplings, onion pancakes.  They are about average for BBQ pork buns, sticky rice in lotus leaf, black pepper spare ribs and siu mai. They are below average for their deserts and shrimp dumplings (ha gow).

For the downtown dim sum crowd, eating here is like eating for free. The dishes are $2 each, $1.80 in the afternoon. Specific dumpling and special Chinese pancakes are $3 to $4.  Even for Scarborough residents it is quite reasonably priced here with good portions.

Wait staff is friendly, but they are used to being spoken to in some form of Chinese. They do speak English, but none of them speak it as their first language. Just don't get frustrated and ask again, they don't care if you ask a few times and neither should you. 

If you come to order Szechuan, don't expect westernized versions. It's the real deal here folks. Many spicy items are \"numbing\" spicy, rather than hot spicy, expect it to be like a tube of Orajel is in the dish. And, there will be what seems like 1 lbs of chillies in your dish (I don't even know how they make money it must be close to $10 of chili peppers in there). It is an acquired taste, however, very authentic stuff, and you see mainly mainland new Chinese immigrants eating here and having a great time of it.

A cheap option is their hotpot, which is 11 bucks (or so) and enough for 2 people. You have the option of 1/2 hot (numbing) + 1/2 normal soup, or full bowl of either; probably best just to get the normal (but then again it might be a way to see if my description above was just hyperbole). Comes with one plate of meat, and one large plate combined of veggies, tofu and noodles. (Restaurant next door has regular all you can eat hot pot).

If you're ever up here, or want to have a big dim sum for cheap, try this place out."}
{"text":"It's awesome. Authentic flavours and awesome Sichuan peppercorns. I highly recommend the fish in boiled spice soup!"}
{"text":"I was taken here by some Chinese friends after they were tired of me complaining I couldn't find dishes like I had in China. So let that be a lesson that complaining does get you good things.

The small tables I was unable to fit my legs under immediately made me feel like I was back in China. I am very tall so you probably won't have this problem.

I really wanted to order a fish dish, but my fellow Canadian in the group was hesitant so we just went for staples. ?????? was my favourite of our dishes. The only bad one was the bamboo dish which I can't remember the name.

Overall none of the dishes were spicy, but they all tasted authentic. I'll have to try the dim sum next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant opens till 3am. We went there around midnight and loved all the food we ordered except for one dish. See pictures for more details. Highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely go back. They have special pricing for late night dining"}
{"text":"Went for dinner at this place on a Saturday night.  A coworker recommended it and said it was authentic northern chinese flood.  Got a table right away as place was only half full. Decor of the place is typical of most Chinese restaurants and so not a place to impress the ladies with.  Wait staff were wearing coordinated black tops but they were not all the same issue and so it was a little more effort to locate them as I had to do double takes to make sure I wasn't doing the embarrassing thing where you call over a customer by mistake. 

We ordered 3 dishes. They were Chicken with Chilli (sic), spicy beef and szechuan Dan Dan noodles. All of the dishes were spicy and the menu warns you that it is.  I didn't find it very spicy myself but then again I can handle spicy food better than the avg person. So first came the noodles which came in a peanuty spicy sauce. Next came the chicken dish which was my favourite dish there. It  was diced into small pieces like popcorn chicken. The chicken had a crispy outside but tender inside and a ting of spice. The only negative was that it was a little salty and so I had to gulp down copious amounts of rice and water. Lastly was the beef dish. It too was battered and had a crispy texture but yet soft and spicy.  I didn't like the dish too much as I felt it was very oily as you could tell it was deep fried. 

Overall I would recommend this restaurant. The portions are big and plentiful and the price is very fair. Order the chicken for sure and skip the beef. I'm sure I'll be back again to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We always come here for the dim sum special. One of the best bargain in town $2.10 each and we like the taste - slightly different with those in HK restaurants around GTA. It's not as oily, and the food has more seasoning.

As for their Szechuan specialty dishes, we order the spicy cold noodle $3.99 - huge portion and delicious. We also try their other cold dishes - also good."}
{"text":"We used to come here about once a month for dim sum. The food is delicious, the prices are great, the servers are friendly, and the place is decorated nicely with a very strong Chinese influence (we really like the paper-wood lanterns that hang over the tables!). 

The last time we went (around two months ago), it wasn't as great as before. The durian pastry was a bit undercooked and raw beneath the durian filling, and the food seemed... greasier, somehow. The service is still great, though. Maybe we just went on a bad day? It was definitely 5/5 before, but our last visit had really disappointed us. The shrimp dumplings are still delicious, though, and the meat-veggie-rice bowl things were still good. So try that!"}
{"text":"Before my first visit to Szechuan Legend, my knowledge of Szechuan food was about the size of a Szechuan peppercorn.  But after last night's Hot n' Spicy food crawl, I have gained a better understanding of this fiery Chinese cuisine and learned that the Szechuan peppercorn is not my friend.

+ At first glance, the Spicy Poached Fish looked delicious and deadly.  The poached fish was cooked to perfection and absolutely divine.  It was rustic, garlicky, spicy and so tender.  Warning, be sure to avoid eating the Szechuan peppercorns in order to avoid the mouth-Novacain-numbling sensation. [http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/nH9sGGOaW0ONeIYcmsK3EQ?select=vVyzIrSatCwYLsV2OQE1vw]

+ Spicy Pork Slice was one of my favorites.  The long slices of pork belly were so scrumptious with spicy garlic sauce.  [http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/nH9sGGOaW0ONeIYcmsK3EQ?select=xrm4MNaR2wgEfd73pfDBuA]

+ The bony Spicy Duck Tongue was interesting.  Or was it the Novacain-effect from the peppercorns talking?[http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/nH9sGGOaW0ONeIYcmsK3EQ?select=sHKtEWIFieGYFzOi96nCGg]

+ Stir fried Spicy Bitter Melon was yummy.  If you are not familiar with bitter melon, you may not like this dish.  I loved the bitterness of the melon, the spiciness of the chili and the flavorful minced pork, a good combination.  [http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/nH9sGGOaW0ONeIYcmsK3EQ?select=k30JGXlCwOc_AgbHC9dtoQ]

I thoroughly enjoyed my culinary exploration at Szechuan Legend, from the tastiness and authenticity of the food to the traditional, classic Chinese décor.  The sights and sounds of the local Chinese crowd as well as the company completed this marvelous culinary journey."}
{"text":"In the past, I've gone with my family and eaten a lot from this place. It was good back then. Now, it has gotten worse.

My family and I went there on Sunday to eat lunch. It was pretty empty, which is good. There were three other groups: the group that was behind the divider and the rest of the groups out somewhere in the middle.

When we sat down and looked at the menu, we noticed that the prices of the dim sum jumped. It was way pricier. At that point, I felt that the quantity and quality have dropped significantly. I was right.

When the food arrived after some wait time, we saw the difference right away. The size of food (can't remember the names), looked like it shrank. There were less pieces too. The meatball of my childhood wasn't the size of a tennis ball any longer, it was the size of slightly large Swedish meatballs that you can get from Ikea. The food was way too greasy.

While eating and waiting for the food to arrive at our table, we started to sweat a lot. It was way too hot. The cutlery and the plates, bowls, and cups weren't clean. The chopsticks felt sticky. We had to clean them ourselves. None of the dim sum were properly cut. The floors were sticky, even in the washroom.

The service was OK. Since there weren't many groups in the restaurant, you would expect good, fast service. We sat there waiting for our last dim sum dish to come out. My mom tried to wave down someone. No one came. The waiters/waitresses just stood there at the other side of the restaurant and not paying attention.

I recommend that you do not go here. The quality, the quantity, the service and the cleanliness of this place has drastically fallen. This place was my Chinese childhood. I have had better."}
{"text":"I came here because my sister wanted Hot Pot and my grandparents wanted Dim Sum and my mom thought this would be good place for both. 

BOY oh BOY was she wrong.

The dim sum here is pretty darn horrible. Nothing tastes quite right.

The hot pot had two sections, one spicy and one mild. The spicy side was SOOOo spicy, but so yummy.  The dish of lamb was small and okay, the side veggies were decent too. 

I wouldn't come here again for dim sum for sure, but maybe for their spicy dishes instead."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I tried several dishes and almost all are very delicious. They are not small, can serve about 25 tables at the same time and 2 private dinning rooms. The parking lot is enough. Just the service need to be improved."}
{"text":"I have been here three times in total, and all of them invites from family friends, all of them with prospective romantic partners.

So I don't know what Szechuan is supposed to look like, but judging from the décor, it looks like any other Chinese courtyard restaurant. Wall seating, round tables, and semi-private dining rooms. But as friends and family gathering goes, it's always the round tables. These tables seat a party of 8-10 comfortably. There isn't much to say about the décor, it's traditional Chinese, but nothing is emphasized, and I never understood why they must display the giant fish tanks?

The service is expected as a mid scale restaurant, professional and pretty fast. I always left the ordering to the \"adults,\" as these are pretty authentic selections. One can also go by the photos provided for some of the dishes, but I recommend bringing someone of in-depth knowledge with Chinese food. I had some breaded straw fungus, it was probably my favourite dish. The fish here are popular, as well as the lamb soup. Every time coming here we end up ordering over a dozen dishes, all to extend the duration in the establishment allowing for maximal awkward conversation. 
What is this, the 'bring you sons & daughters so they can be forced acquainted' capital of Toronto? I always imagined meeting my parents' choice of an ideal Woman at a bigger than life restaurant in China, or the hotel lobby of the Shangri La. But I guess this place would suffice.

From a future parent's perspective, this place isn't romantic. There are modified cars out front in the parking lot, Chinese kids with whatever latest trend of hairstyles that is going around Pacific mall nowadays dining beside you, and not a lot of privacy. The food is good, but get your priority straight!
Perhaps the staff here could use more identifiable uniforms, as someone from my group ordered more napkins from a girl who didn't work here. 
I try my hardest to judge this solely as a restaurant, but my experiences here were all awkward, and inauspicious. I think my parents should understand that if they are to hitch their kids with their family friend's, then they need to actually select a venue where their children can actually get their 'game' on. My game is played in Yorkville, not Scarborough. I can't bloody well seduce while shoving a bowl of rice and greasy mushroom down my throat. 

Szechuan Legend, where potential arranged marriages become highly awkward experiences."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum. Excellent taste. Got siu mai, har gow, chicken feet, egg custard tarts, crystal shrimp rolls. The only, bad thing is that we didn't order tea because we knew that they would charge us $1. But they added it on our bill, we disputed this and they gave us some bs answer that they charge it anyways if we don't drink it or not. Then they gave us another bs answer saying they charged it because it was ``standard`` amongst dimsum restaurants. What a load of crock!!! They then said it was being used to pay kitchen staff ahhaha. Honestly, I would've tipped more because my meal was so good! But this left a sour taste in my mouth. Don't get scammed people."}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE! Ordered the Peking duck and when it arrived, it was cold and the taste was stale. We asked the waitress to redo the dish but received a no and when the discussion got heated about what they will do to resolve the issue of the stale duck, the waitress told us to call the police. I cannot understand how the staff can be trained with such disappointing customer service and to tell us to call police if we are unhappy.
What a terrible dinner experience when celebrating Mother's Day. Ended up getting a small dish of chicken to remedy the problem of...stale duck and the loss of two dishes that were supposed to be made by the remaining duck meat."}
{"text":"The food is good for the price - I recommend ordering from their set price menu (dinner for xx) - $68 for garlic lobster, fried fish filet, steamed chicken, a vegetable soup, and garlic bok choy. 

I also really enjoy their spicy cold noodles dumplings ad soup dumplings - reminds me of the noodles I had in Beijing.

Service is kind of slow but I can overlook it given the price and the taste of the food!"}
{"text":"This review is coming from an out of towner...foreigner actually. 

The first selling point is that this place is open until 4 am. 

Secondly most of the food we had was fantastic, although not as spicy as I thought it would be. The defining feature of Sichuan cuisine is not just spicy, but mouth numbing. I felt the mouth numb from the peppers of our dishes, but not so much the heat. Barring that, there were several stand out dishes like the sauteed green beans, the spicy fried chicken, and the egg mixed with crab and broccoli. The mapo tofu was kind of disappointing...the flavors weren't really there. There was also a pork belly dish which I could only eat a couple bites of because it was so fatty and oversauced. But as someone who doesn't get to eat good authentic Chinese very often, the food here REALLY hit the spot."}
{"text":"This is the best price and average quality DS Chinese restaurant in GTA area. We came to lunch time during special priced hour 1330 to 1600.  They offer valuable price DS and they give free Chinese newspaper everyday. It is always full house on special lunch hours. Come early and get a table early is my tip. They have minimal services and pls do not expect high end asian service. All I can say is come for value and not come for service.  

My rating is based on food value and acceptable service. They recently also give free calendar 2018 for customers.  I am very happy to visit here for lunch, great value and bonus freebies."}
{"text":"The place is pretty big, bright and spacious with wooden furniture. It was probably a quarter full when I came. 

The food isn't bad. I recommend the duck and tofu soup, it seems like the perfect bowl to sip on on a cold day. The eggplant is also pretty delicious, sauteed with a yummy sauce and made to order. The sweet and sour fish cutlets were kind of okay... But I prefer sweet and sour pork way more. I DO NOT recommend the peking duck wraps. The duck didn't taste fresh, the wraps were REALLY thin, the veggies seemed kinda old and the brown sauce tasted kind of sour. I was pretty disappointed by this dish. 

It's worth a try, service is pretty attentive."}
{"text":"The food here is great, especially the spicy dishes. Service could be faster. Asked for ice water and never came. Had to ask 2 more times to get that straightened out. What's good about this place is they give a big bowl of noodles if you go on the day of your bday."}
{"text":"Every Christmas, we have a family gathering at this restaurant, and my overall impression has always been positive.

The cooking style is admittedly not 100% authentic to Sichuan (my family is from there). The freshness of the spices and the levels of spiciness are certainly different. Nevertheless, the food is still authentically Chinese. 
We usually reserve one of the private \"rooms\" and order a set of dishes, which come at a good pace, until the whole table is covered. Portions are generous, and everything is consistently well prepared.

Always a great meal to look forward to."}
{"text":"This is a great place for traditional Chinese-Szechuan cuisine.  I have not had amazing cuisine and taste like this restaurant for a while. I was very pleased with the service since the waiters were very attentive and they actually cleared our plates three times since we had lobster. Overall, this place has a great reputation for good prices on their dim sum and stir fry dishes. When you enter, you feel like you are entering a historic Chinese monument. I would recommend coming to this place if you are looking for authentic Szechuan cuisine."}
{"text":"Vic H. covered Szechuan Legend quite well so I'll just put some additions into the Dum Sum I had.  It's located in the Scarboro Village Plaza which is extremely busy as one of the main spots of Chinese food during Lunch and Dinner.  If you come at the wrong time, the parking can be ridiculous and the signs and one way roads of this Plaza is confusing for beginners.

Szechuan Legend has 2 other branches named: Chilli Secret(Leslie/Hwy 7) and Backyard Garden(Steeles/Warden).  The ambiance is very classic Chinese wooden furniture and wall dividers with chiseled designs.  Chairs were FLAT and hard wood that doesn't allow you to slouch, unfortunately our generation is too used to slouching.

As a Szechuan Restaurant they offer Cantonese Dim Sum($1.8 - $2) and most are standard, nothing exciting to report here except that the Steamed Rice Noodle Roll was commented as smooth.  Not the best Dim Sum but edible and enjoyable by most of the local retired Chinese folks that are treated and greeted by the server while they were less enthusiastic towards us NEW faces.  Took 2 tries to get my Mustard condiment.

Btw, you know that most of these older folks are returning locals to this restaurant when everyone of them has something to pack away and they know exactly which drawer to get the bags and containers from.

Service     - 2.0 *Star*
Dim Sum - 0.5 *Star*
Decor       + 0.5 *Star*
Price         + 0.5 *Star*

=                   2.5 *Star*"}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly good.  Peking duck had lots of meat.  Nice thin pancakes.  Paid extra to have deep fried duck bones instead of soup.  Very good value.

Cumin lamb was large portion of meat, not just onion fillers.  Stir fried bokchoi had lots of wokhay.

Spicy nails was good portion as well.  Dumplings very flavourful.  Right amount of flavour and fresh.

Service a bit slow since not enough servers but food was delicious.  Will definitely visit again.

Maybe even try cheap dim sum."}
{"text":"My family and I came to this restaurant for a belated mother's day dinner. We made reservations for 7:30pm but arrived early. We were seated right away. We ordered the 10 person meal set. In the first hour of sitting at the table, we only recieved 3 of our dishes. My father asked one of the waitresses about one of the dishes and at first was ignored. He again flagged her down and the only response he recieved was that it was on its way.

We have watched a table who was seated after us recieve basically all of their food before we did. This is unacceptable that we have to wait 10-15 minute for each dish when the restaurant is 75% empty. The service here is terrible, and I am thoroughly unimpressed. I can see why the restaurant is 75% empty.

I only gave it one star because there wasn't an option for negatives."}
{"text":"I came here for their afternoon tea time special. All dim sum is only $1.78 between 1:30-4pm, execpt for the ones that are special and listed as $2.50. Dim sum is cheap, fresh, and quite good. Tea price is $0.50/person. Their rice noodle wrapped chinese donut is amazing. I also enjoy their different style rice as well as their egg tart. I see people ordering 10+ more dimsum and bringing them home. I mean the rice is only $1.78, you can save it for lunch tomorrow. Their stir fry noodle with beef is only $3.99. It is a little oily, but quite good for its price. Service is efficient."}
{"text":"It's my dad's birthday, my mom wanted to try someplace new and we thought why not try Szechuan Legend since there was an ad on the Chinese newspaper advertising how cheap their dinner is. Of course we have to go yum cha to test out the place first.

I'm just going to say this now, this place is terrible. Here are the list of things that made our yum cha experience unpleasant.

1. Floor was slippery. There were oil spots that weren't mopped up. My grandma nearly slipped on them.
2. The utensils were dirty. Chopsticks were sticky. Cups and bowls were oily. It was ridiculously disgusting.
3. The food was bland. It's one thing for the food to be tasteless, it's another to be tasteless AND oily. It was essentially drenched in oil.

Sure, the price was good but that doesn't mean everything else has to drop in quality.

We ended up cancelling our reservation because my cousin ate dinner here not so long ago and had a serious case of diarrhea. So yeah, no thanks. Even if the prices are really cheap, we would rather not hurt ourselves."}
{"text":"Szechuan Legend is franchised and there are many of them in GTA and in Markham area.  To make it easier for some of my colleagues, we came to this Scarborough location right at midland and finch instead of travelling more North.

I have to say, the prices at this location is much cheaper than the other ones, however, this place suffers the same downfall as many other Chinese restaurants.  And yes, I am talking about the service.  I usually do not mind the service if price is cheap, but I was very upset during my dinner here.  We ordered a Peking duck combo, which was fairly cheap but the Peking duck came almost last out of all our dishes (which is rare).  That is fine if the duck was actually hot or even warm, nope, the duck and the bread it came with to wrap the duck was cold, well below room temperature.  We asked the server why it was cold, the server said, literally word by word in Mandarin, \"of course it is cold since you guys took forever to start eating it\".  Like for REAL?  The duck JUST arrived on our table so if anything it's your fault that the duck was cold.  Also, all the Chinese restaurants I have been to and ordered Peking Duck, they usually show you the duck and skin it RIGHT infront of you.  This one was all done behind the scenes, so who knows what happened to it.

Anyways, overall the food was so-so, the customer service was horrible.  At the end, we barely gave any tips and will not come to this location ever again!

Beware guys!!  I highly recommend going to another location for Szechuan Legend even if it means a little more expensive for the same food!!"}
{"text":"Not very spacious and the service is slow. The food is sub par- didn't taste fresh. We did enjoy the crispy dough rice roll. The decor was nice. There are so many alternatives in Scarborough please do yourself a favour and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to be invited out to dinner with a friend visiting from out of town. Her aunt had a coupon for a set meal from Szhechuan Legend in Scarborough. I remember eating dim sum here a few years ago and I wasn't too impressed. Tonight, I'm a guest.

The meal deal included three courses of Peking duck, seafood soup, sauteed vegetables, and sweet and sour fish.

The seafood soup, and sauteed vegetables arrived rather quickly and was followed by the sweet and sour fish shortly after. The soup was hearty and thick, the way I like it. There was fish, crab, sea cucumber, shrimps, and vegetables in it. Very good. The sauteed baby bok-choy with garlic was cooked just right and also tasted good. The brightly coloured sweet and sour fish was very tender and flaky, cooked perfectly, and tasty.

The first course of the Peking Duck arrived with lots of thinly sliced duck meat in a large bowl. Pancakes (for wrapping), green onions, cucumbers, and hoisin sauce were served on a separate plate. Wow, that looked like a lot of meat! It must have been a big duck. Unfortunately, it was a little on the dry side and the skin wasn't crispy like it's supposed to be. Crispy skin is a very important part of this dish!

If you're unfamiliar with Peking Duck, the pancakes are used as a wrap for a couple of slices of the duck meat, a few slivers of cucumber and green onions, and a dab of hoisin sauce. See photo. It tasted okay, despite the dry duck. The pancakes were perfect and didn't stick together. Peking duck is usually served in two or three courses.

The second course was a soup made from the bones of the duck. It's a thin broth with some veggies and tofu. It tasted okay but a second soup? Not sure if this menu makes total sense.

The third (and last) course of the duck used more of the duck meat, stir-fried with peppers and onions and served with lettuce for wrapping. The green onions, cucumbers, and hoisin sauce from the first course go well with this. Again, this tasted okay but nothing special. After having three courses of the Peking Duck, I think I could have done without the soup course.

The service was fairly quick and efficient as far as serving and clearing goes. Our two servers, however, didn't speak or understand much English. I had asked for an additional plate for my photos and they had no idea what I was saying. Thank goodness our host spoke Cantonese.

Overall, the first soup and the fish were really good. The veggies were a little above average. The duck, the main feature of our set menu, was a disappointment. Although it tasted okay, I've had much better elsewhere, even at buffet restaurants. If I come back here, I wouldn't order this duck."}
{"text":"It was Chris T.'s farewell - he decided to choose this place because he LOVES spicy food.  So we went -- all 24 of us.

Floors were... slippery - just warning you.

We ordered a BUNCH of dishes at each table:
STARCH NOODLES IN CHILI SAUCE: if you can't handle your spice, do NOT - do NOT eat these.  Our lips were quivering.

SPICY BEEF SLICES: good, tender, and delicious!  

SPICY FRIED CHICKEN: I don't think that this is what the dish was actually called - but it was good.

SPICY POACHED FISH (LARGE): don't let this large bowl fool you.  The fish was absolutely delicious and not too spicy - however, avoid the cabbage if you're trying to avoid ultra spice.

SPICY STIR FRIED BITTER MELON: I love my bitter melon, but I found this to be a bit too bitter.

EGGPLANT:  Cooked to perfection - I absoultely loved this dish.  It was quite flavourful considering that my tongue was burning.

FOUR SEASON BEANS: I can't complain - I love my string beans.

LAMB SKEWERS:  I thought these were delicious - however, they were fried, not BBQed.  But what do you expect.

It's quite the spicy spicy.  All of us were sweating beads and turning red."}
{"text":"I seldom come here for their regular dinner/lunch restaurant food but go for dimsum instead usually with one other person a few times a month. I go with one other person because any more than that, we'd be stuck waiting in line for quite sometime. It gets really busy especially during 1:30-2:30pm because the dimsum is cheapest after 1:30pm. The interior of the place is very pleasant despite how crowded it gets. As far as food quality goes, it is standard and reasonable in price. They also have a few food items that some dimsum places don't generally offer (so that's a plus!). The food sometimes comes out slow (don't mind me emphasizing this again, but perhaps because of the crowded atmosphere!). Overall, a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum between exams, I was pretty impressed with most of the food we ordered.  However, the names of the foods were slightly different from what I was used to, so it took me awhile to figure out what to order (I can't read the chinese).  They also had a TV right above our table, so we watched soccer while we waited for food.

Mango pudding & egg tarts were by far our favourites, as with the shrimp noodles.  Amazing food in general, and good service.  Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"My family & I used to come here for dim sum all the time and, somwhere along the way, we stopped. Returned here recently and am sad to see the quality in all aspects has gone down. My favourite order here is the 'chicken with auricalaria' rice, which is still fairly good. My dad, an avid lover of all things spicy, is addicted to their chili wontons. Everything else--all the usual dim-sum suspects--are simply average, though they used to be great: hot & fresh. Now, most of the dishes we get are often lukewarm, at best. 
This place used to be extremely busy during regular dim sum hours, and now we can get a seat almost immediately which, to me, is only an indication of its decline. With only half the crowd, you'd think service would be much quicker, but it isn't. And out of the last handful of visits, there have been at least 2 occurences of forgotten dishes. I think it's time to move on..."}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum after 1:30pm because every dish was $1.65 (super cheap!). Here is a list of all the things I ordered:

Pumpkin and corn congee - one of the better pumpkin congee I've had
Shrimp with leek and chives dumpling - standard good taste
Shrimp rice roll - the soy sauce came in a different bowl which was nice for those that like this dish plain
Chive pancake ($2.99 for 1 piece) - this is on the pricier side and the taste isn't as good as New Northern Dumplings (they sell is for $3.99 for 3 pieces)
Mango pudding - nothing special
Squid - it wasn't as crispy as I would like it, it was actually very squishy and I've never had it so squishy at a Chinese restaurant before

I would definitely come back here for the cheap prices to try out some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"This restaurant looks good from the outside however it was a bad experience. The service is slow and servers are rude. We had to get up and grab our own chopsticks (ours fell), only one server at prime dinner time and we got up to get extra napkins. We ordered a set meal and waited for almost 30-40 mins before the first dish arrived. We also added a fried rice on the side but they didn't add it to order and we were waiting for a long time for it because we were expecting it. When they brought the food, they literally let it go at the table and slide it. We ordered Peking Duck as part of the set meal and they brought it as the 4th dish so our plates were already used and covered with sauces and stuff. We asked for new plates so we can actually put the wrap on the plate and eat the Peking Duck. The server looked at us and was like you already have plates and we said we need it for this dish. She gave us a look and rolled her eyes at us. Dessert was part of the set meal and they didn't give it to us, we had to ask for it after they gave us the bill . We waited for another 20 mins and they came to the table wondering why we didn't put money on the tray yet. Definitely would not come back again. Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"I really don't have much to say about this place anymore. We came back to this place to have dim sum and we hoped it would be as amazing as it was before. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The quality has gone down this time. We had the usual siu mai, har gow, etc. This time , I thought the filling in these dishes were very dry and bland. Long story short, we will not come back."}
{"text":"I had no idea they served Cantonese style dim sum from the name of the restaurant, but was introduced to it when yelping for dim sum in Scarborough. From 1:30-3:30pm, dim sum is $1.68, which is when I go. I find myself coming here every time I'm craving for some quick cheap dim sum. They have a relatively decent selection - although not as extensive as Cantonese restaurants. But for the price you pay, this dim sum place can't be beat! I like how the food comes out piping hot each time and they don't charge for table cloth and tea only 80 cents for however many people you have. Most locations I've been to charge table cloth fee and $1 tea per person. They also serve Szechuan style dishes like noodles, rice and snacks for those wanting a little more variety which is a plus. One star off is because the food quality could be better - but you really can't complain for the price right? Overall, would highly recommend coming here for afternoon dim sum."}
{"text":"I used to go here with my mom for dim sum.

Haven't been back for years..

The chicken soup is really good.. The dim sum itself is normal.. They got rid of my sister and I's favourite multilayer cake dessert... so we don't go here anymore 

Great dim sum place for people who are in a budget.. There are no surprises"}
{"text":"Summary: slow, small portion, bad service, and did I say slow?

We made reservation, arrive on time (7:30pm) order set dinner for 10. We had to wait for almost an hour until first dish comes, and waited even more for the rest of the dishes comes out. In addition, the portion small and not satisfying. 

Spending for over 2 1/2 hours waiting for dishes to come out, even after repeated request to expedite. 

Definitely not recommended."}
{"text":"We had a very good experience with the combination duck plates. We got three dishes out of the one duck, one being a soup. We also ordered a spicy fish soup dish, clear noodle in chili sauce, and stinky tofu (not a fan of that) and there was actually too much food. We bought all of this for only $12 per person. We were all more than full with leftovers still on the table. 

       We were invited for lunch here with some other out of town friends. We had lunch just before making our way home. Were were a party of six. We had a large round table with more then enough room and it was quite comfortable. Our Chinese Ottawa friend was very impressed because she doesn't like any of the Chinese restaurants in Ottawa anymore, save one, and thought that this place was very \"Chinese\" and greatly enjoyed her food. She also has a point that going to a place like this with a large good is better as you can order more and try a larger variety of dishes. 

        The duck was really excellent, especially the soup that was make with all the leftover parts. The breast was sliced as one dish and I don't remember the rest of it. Something with interesting wraps and lettuce. I was surprised it all came from one duck. I don't think anyone had any complaints about any of the dishes. 

       The restaurant interior for me as a westerner, was pretty interesting. They had nice woodwork decorating all the walls and even the washroom doors, even if it was getting a bit worn in places. For example, traditional Chinese screens separated off some private dinning rooms. The furniture too was all wood and Chinese style. Apparently this is common in Toronto and everywhere in China, so my wife barely noticed. I guess I'm just a small town country boy. I was still impressed
  
     We were there for a late lunch, and the place was PACKED. There was a steady stream of people coming in and out. This also made the place, very very loud. We had to almost shout at each other at the same table to have a conversation. The staff were literally shouting at each other across the room to coordinate as they cleaned tables. This was probably the biggest disadvantage of this place. 

      I was shocked at the location. It was in a strip mall, entirely filled with Chinese restaurants, right now door to another strip mall completely full of more Chinese restaurants. I found this pretty wild. I'm guessing extreme competition keeps their prices down. 

      Service was fine, no complaints. Things moved fast so they took the order quickly and got food on the table quickly, but made no effort to kick us out despite being there for over an hour. 

     Parking was a HUGE problem. People were constantly circling the parking lot trying to find a space. 

    Conclusion, good food and really cheap. Good space for larger groups of 4-8 but be prepared for a very, very loud space."}
{"text":"Szechuan Legend has been a fixture in this plaza for years. It serves an electic mix of traditional Szechuan/Northern Chinese dishes such as kung pao chicken, hot and sour soup, and spicy tripe, along with Cantonese-style dim sum. The food itself relatively good, especially the dim sum, given its low price point relative to other nearby dim sum establishments. The interior decor is a bit dated and could use some updating. The customer service is alright for a restaurant of this type, and the restaurant itself isn't usually that busy. All in all, this is a great spot for those that want a cheap dim sum lunch or want to sample some traditional Szechuan and Northern Chinese cuisine after a night out on the town."}
{"text":"It's funny that although this chain has three locations that has the same name in chinese (half-acre garden as its literal translation), each of their English name is different. 

I've been to the one in Metro Square a couple of times, and this might be my first or second time at this location. I've been craving their \"water cooked beef\" for a while now, which is really hot spicy and numbing stew with beef and napa cabbage. It was really good, although I think I remember it being better. Another favourite of ours is the \"minced garlic white meat\" which is a cold dish. They make it well here.

In general, most of the common szechuan food they serve here is authentic and tasty, so there's not much to complain about. Service here is pretty good for a Chinese restaurant. 

I've never been here for dimsum, but i likely would not go to a szechuan restaurant for that!"}
{"text":"Frequent visitor to this restaurant. I love the prices and the food. From 1:30pm-4pm on Mondays-Thursdays the dim sum dishes are all $1.60 each. I've been to other cheap Chinese restaurants but the food weren't nearly as good. I'm very satisfied with the price, taste and service.
Edit: There was this one time I brought someone and the service was really bad. Some of the dishes I wanted weren't available and the food took over 30 minutes to arrive. I haven't went back since. Quite a disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on the weekend with family. The prices are quite cheap but you pay for what you get. The dumplings are deceptively large as the \"har-gow\" and steamed rice noodles seem big, but are mostly dough. They skimp on the filling so I don't think I'd come back to this establishment as a regular dim sum place. They don't cut any of the dim sum either, which is quite odd for a dim sum restaurant. We had to ask for additional utensils and service was slow even though it wasn't packed. The seats by the door are the worst as their doors don't do a good job of blocking out the wind."}
{"text":"If you are into Hot and Spicy like me, Szechuan Legend is the place to go! Here you will find dishes that will bring tears in your eyes, drink water like crazy and your face all red and sweaty.

My favourite dishes here are:
- Fuqi feipian/Mixed Spicy Beef ($6.99) which is made of thinly sliced beef, beef lung/stomach/tongue, and a generous amount of spices, including Szechuan pepper
- Spicy Poached Fish ($9.99) where the delicate and tender white fish showcases the hot and numbing effects of the chillies and Sichuan pepper
- Spicy Bittermelon ($7.99)
- Starch Noodle with Chilli Sauce ($5.99)

Beware of the dishes with 3 peppers icon next to them, those are really not for non spicy eat!

Most of the waitress staff here speak Mandarian, so it is a good place for me to practice my limited vacobulary.

They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I enjoyed it a lot. I came here today for the second time and they literally forgot we ordered..... We were waiting like half an hour and had to tell then again. Well there were a lot of people... So I'll give the benefit of the doubt... It was a Saturday morning too. Food was delicious regardless. Didn't take proper pictures cause we were taking care of my nephew. Get the durian pastry. And the chicken feet. It may look weird and gross but it's delicious. Definitely a favourite. Everything we got was A-OK!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name: there are plenty of non-spicy dishes here. This is probably one of the cheapest places for dim sum in Toronto/Scarborough! If you come between 1:30-4:00 PM on weekdays each dish is only $1.60, and the dishes are actually a decent size too. Ordered 8 dishes between two people (we couldn't finish it all, so took some home), and the total bill was less than $15 :) Also they don't charge for tea.

The quality of the food was pretty good, pretty standard dim sum stuff, but again, points awarded because of the low price and large portions. They had a few interesting things on the menu i.e. deep fried milk (which was quite good btw, light and slightly sweet!) The decor of the restaurant is also kind of interesting, not like a traditional Chinese restaurant, they have like these interesting wood seats (still okay comfortable) and tables.

Overall I would come again to this place just because the dim sum is cheap and the food quality is pretty good :) I think prices on weekends are pretty reasonable as well, I believe it is $2.30/dish before 4 PM!"}
{"text":"The dim sum dishes are around $1.80 each on the weekdays, $2.00 each on the weekends and $3.00 to $4.00 for specials. As a self proclaim food blogger, I cannot vouch for Szechuan LegendRestaurant. As a matter of fact, I despise this restaurant. My first experience at Szechuan Legend Restaurant was horrible. I am guessing the restaurant is legendary for the awful food. The siu mai (pork dumplings) and ha gow (shrimp dumplings) were expired."}
{"text":"Update: 3/2018: Oh wow, what the heck happened?     The food now has been modified to North American fake chinese you'd get anywhere in the USA (the cheap crap you should never eat).    Gone is the authenticity and bountiful flavour, replaced by sugar, grease, fat, and sodium.    Yikes!  Must be new ownership and crew to fall that far.    Fortunately, Lin's Chinese Buns is nearby and hasn't stumbled!  Lowering to a 1 star cause I can't give 0 stars.

Original review: Came here first time many years ago the only Caucasian guy who never had authentic Chinese. Great stuff.  I've read some mixed reviews, but never had anything but a great experience.  My then girlfriend made some of my favorite Chinese dishes, she is a Chinese immigrant, and the restaurant dishes were very authentic. Love the place and will keep going back. The relationship ended, but found some great eats!"}
{"text":"If you love spicy food, this is a great place for you to check out! Their dishes are so full of flavor. It's my FAVORITE restaurant in Toronto (there I said it), I come here any chance I get (wish I lived closer). Their beef Szechuan dish is my favorite.. I'm just drooling thinking about it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In short..

-Utensils, plates, bowls and tables were dirty and greasy.
-Floor is slippery.
-Uncomfortably hot and humid in the restaurant.
-Service is SO slow. We waited ~20 mins to get tea, and 45 mins for 1 dimsum item to come out from the 5 simple things we ordered. 
-The one item that did come out, spare ribs with black beans, had literally 4 black beans thrown on (not mixed it). 
-A waitress full on dropped a fried taro \"dumpling\" on our table while she was walking by, picked it up, put it back onto the plate and delivered it to the table that ordered it. She didn't even hesitate (which honestly made me laugh). 

Ultimately, we decided not to wait another 40 mins for something to come out, so we tried to pay the bill for the items that did come, but the cashier tried to hastle us and make us pay for stuff that hadn't come to the table. 

We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First off,  the menu is pretty useful since they went to the trouble of taking a picture of almost every item in their menu.  We ordered 1) chili chicken 2) beef tendon 3) some stir-fried green veggies, pea shoots if I recall. 

Chili chicken : ....Two words. SUPER SALTY. Could not eat more than maybe 5 pieces... Feels like they marinated the chicken in salt before cooking it because the few veggies that went along with it were ok to eat. 

Beef tendon : Whatever they have listed in english as beef tendon is actually sliced beef... they better fix that translation.  Boy was I disappointed :( Beef tendon is one of those things I don't eat very often but I actually really like it.  We called them over and explained that what they wrote as beef tendon is not actually beef tendon, but the staff were pretty much like \"Well that's the dish number you ordered\" so that was that. 

Veggies : Pretty much a plate of green veggies devoid of any spices. But this eaten after the chili chicken did a good job of washing away the saltiness in my mouth. 

I can believe that maybe their other dishes could be good, but service was meh so I'm in no rush to come back here with so many szechuan options around scarborough and markham."}
