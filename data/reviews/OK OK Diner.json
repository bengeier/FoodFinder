{"text":"It was pretty dismal. Went for Sunday brunch and while our server was pleasant, she forgot part of my order and never checked in on the table. The food was bad. I had a sort of huevos rancheros inspired dish that arrived cold and tasted like the eggs you get on an airplane. The eggs were stuffed with tasteless cheese and a lump of watery guacamole was thrown on top of the whole pile. My fiancé's eggs came with 3 triangle frozen potato patties and were topped with badly broken hollandaise. With coffees and tip the meal came to about $40..... Not too bad for brunch...... But for $40 I want something better than what comes to my seat on Air Canada."}
{"text":"After walking by a million times, we finally went in for Sunday brunch. When we walked in, we ran into some friends and were able to sit with them. I'm sure that the folks standing in line were envious. what can you do?

My friends live in the area and go quite regularly and said that they normally share a breakfast and each order a side. 

I ordered the Huevos & I can see why, it was a huge log! It was a flour tortilla wrapped around eggs, cheese and black beans topped with a dollop of Gaucamole, sour cream & salsa. It was A-OK. 

The server was nice and attentive. 

**If you don't want to wait in line, go early!!**"}
{"text":"Been here a few times since moving to the neighborhood and haven't been disappointed. Solid food and decent coffee. Space is small but I've never had to wait long if at all."}
{"text":"\"A grumpy and terse waitress \" as from what I read in another review is really close to this woman and her wait staff skills. 

Third time experiencing the local spot - definitely the last time. 

First time was solo and they were very busy. Decent burger. 
Second time the server was glaring instead of waiting my table with company. Definitely in a foul mood and visibly shown. 
Third visit, today, incorrect orders. Sarcasm when addressed. 

I'm no fan and won't need to go back here."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch on a sunny Saturday morning.
Buttermilk pancakes are amazing, the rest is regular. Hash browns were not good (frozen, old oil).
Waitress was very kind."}
{"text":"Last minute brunch and feel like I hit a jackpot! We must have hit good time (12:45 on a Sunday) as we were seated immediately and had the option of the patio. 

This is a casual spot with comfy patio space. Had a lovely waitress who was kind, quick and easy going. Offered specific suggestions when asked. I had the eggs Bernadette / poached eggs, with spinach on a hash brown. Was delicious and came out quickly. The waitress offered a fresh lemonade to enjoy the sunshine as we were seated and it was delicious! 

Will definitely come back and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for a casual spot to eat."}
{"text":"Went back after my past bad experience and now i can say I really enjoyed brunch Food was good and the waiter seemed nice. Nice local spot for brunch."}
{"text":"Burgers.
Eat the burgers.
One of the best kept burger secrets in town.
Don't get fooled by the breakfasts and the hashbrowns (yes, those are all plenty solid too, nothing to shake a stick at, nothing fancy either, just straight up and hearty) but if you've got a hangover and a hankering for a cheeseburger and a chocolate shake? Drag that headache on over and sink your teeth into their homemade patties and revisit the previous nights antics, and yes, you really did do that. But here, have a swig of frosty chocolate shake with pieces of chocolate chunks in it, see? Better!"}
{"text":"Holy moly... this place gets talked about all the time in the neighborhood but I have no idea how they stay in business.  We arrived one Sunday morning and the place was not too packed.  Waited a few minutes for a seat and ended up at the counter as all the booths were taken.  As we sat there the staff basically ignored us and we didn't even get to see a menu until we took the initiative to grab one from another table.  We had to look REALLY obvious before they would serve us.

Upon finally taking our order they immediately started to mess up by adding on beverages we did not order, but with all the commotion we decided it was easier to accept the $4 OJ rather than complain.  Now that wouldn't have been too bad if we didn't proceed to wait almost an hour for our breakfast to reach our table. How does french toast and scrabbled eggs take an hour? I'm pretty sure they forgot about us.  Best part was we got no apology for the slow service, just a grumpy and terse waitress.  If they expect $30 for a very average tasting breakfast (including frozen hashbrowns from a box) I at least expect decent service.

Unfortunately we were not the only ones affected since I counted at least 3 other tables grumbling at the service.  If your restaurant has a small kitchen and has a hard enough time serving the patrons inside the restaurant, you may want to reconsider adding a large external patio.

I'm no fan and won't need to go back here."}
{"text":"I have a thing for old school diners. I love the booths and the tiny cups of coffee and the greasy sausage links.

There's something so universal about them. Constant. And Ok Ok Diner is exactly that, okay. It's not some super huge, up to date, flashy diner meats lunch joint spot. It's not trying to be fancy or nouveau or healthy, it's just a diner in the East end."}
{"text":"Why? Why are so many storefronts in Toronto that are cash only? If you can afford to run a business, you can do afford to accept credit cards, or debit at a minimum. I'm looking at you, Lady Marmalade, Clafouti and Okay Okay Diner. At least LM posts \"Cash Only\" everywhere, and their food is good enough that I don't mind. But Okay Okay? Nope.

I was in a rush and my normal weekend spot, LM, was too busy for me to wait. I went to Okay Diner instead and it was just okay.

The service was just okay. They're not trying to impress anyone, that's for sure. One of my big grievances are places that are a) cash only, but more so, b) don't post it. I went to pay, had no cash and had to schlep over to the 7-Eleven across the street in the rain to pulse out some cash. ANNOYING. 

I ordered the vegetarian eggs benny (whose name I can't remember) and it was just okay. As mentioned in prior reviews, the hashbrowns are storebought. The eggs were poached fine, but there was just less of a restaurant taste to my food and more of a low-end bad cook. 

As I usually do, I ordered a small side of french toast, which was delicious! Thick, eggy bread and a lovely cinnamon butter on top! The only bad part was the cold syrup they gave me to pour on top. #fail

Also, the latte I had was pretty good.

I wouldn't go here again, but if there's nothing else open, it's not the absolute worst place in the world. But seriously -- they need to tell you that it's cash only BEFORE you are trying to pay."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's a lovely diner, perfect for brunch. 

The pancakes are the BEST. Plain, banana & blueberry, or chocolate chip. You get three (each one is as big as your face) served with a healthy serving of butter. I live in the area and if I had my way, I would be there every Saturday morning eating the fantastic pancakes. 

It's a different vibe than a place like Lady Marmalade. But if you want Lady Marmalade... go to Lady Marmalade. Come to OK OK Diner if you want a delicious classic breakfast: pancakes, eggs, bacon, toast, etc. 

A great bonus - the pancakes are only $7.99? Where else can you get breakfast and a coffee for $10? 

I went once and ordered a vegetarian sandwich. I learned my lesson... OK OK is great but stick with the breakfast. The pancakes are amazing and the sandwich and fries were mediocre."}
{"text":"If you're going on a weekend, well, don't. In the winter it might be more manageable, but in the summer, when they triple their capacity by adding a patio, they don't seem to triple their staff - so it's a lot of waiting around. Soooo, it's just OK OK. 

But weekdays? Whole different story. Quick, good diner food. Their all-day breakfast is tasty and that's what I stick with. I'm a sucker for those hashbrown patties.  Weekday it up, OK?!"}
{"text":"Won't be going back, after being a customer since the day they opened. There was some confusion about our order. I tried to explain but all I got was a very bad attitude from Jen, the manager/waitress, who not only blamed me for her mistake, she wound up bullying/humiliating me in front of other diners. She charged me for a special when I ordered only sides, which came to just a few dollars less than the special. Made me feel worse by refusing to take my money for what I did order. I wasn't asking for a free breakfast."}
{"text":"My favourite little breakfast spot in Leslieville.  Seats greeted with a warm smile, and served in a timely manner.  The spinach eggs Benny is my fav.  Been going here for years and have successfully recommended it to many friends!  5 stars guys!  Keep up the good food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some quick sustenance while my boyfriend and I wandered around Leslieville.  We order the grilled cheese and BALT (bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato) sandwiches.  It was the perfect sized snack to keep us going.  Their fries are also really great.  Really enjoyed the decor in the diner as well.  The old school TVs and chalk menu board were great additions.

The only complaint was that their smoke detector went off twice while we were there.  No one seemed worried about it, which made me assume it's a regular occurrence.  It's a small, open concept kitchen that is next to the dining area, so it's bound to happen.... I suppose."}
{"text":"A super lazy mood led us to this nearby diner. Its proximity and the fact that it served breakfast till 4pm were the sole determining factors for this choice of venue. The place is tiny with like a max seated capacity of 25 or so. I, however, did not feel crammed nor suffocated by kitchen smells. I'll give it to them, they figured out how to make good use of space. We were greeted and seated right away, with a standard level of friendliness. The menus are on the table so we just grabbed them, the waiter almost right away came for our drink order. Much appreciated. One coffee, one beer arrived in a jiffy. We ordered your standard 2 eggs, hash brown, meat and toast specials. I got bacon, my date got steak. We were both pleased with our meat selection, taste and quantity wise. As for the hash browns, pfffff! U know those rectangular hash browns you can get in a pack of 10 or 20 in the freezer aisle at the grocery store? Well, yeah, that's what they distastefully served on our platter. I wasn't impressed but I was more in it for the bacon, egg and side of blueberry pancakes, which were quite yummy if you care to know. BUT, a $1.95 surcharge for real maple syrup meant that I was forced to eats pancakes with faux syrup. Sigh. The place wasnt busy so the waiting staff was attentive enough, I got 2-3 refills of coffee, they asked us if we liked our food, etc. They didnt go above or beyond but it wasnt necessary. All in all, I give this place a true score of 2.5 b/c a) it has no 'wow' factor, b) the food is decent in relations to its cost and c) the coffee wasn't all that. I'd go back only because it's conveniently located."}
{"text":"Very good. Everything you want in a breakfast place: fresh, warm, yummy  food; hot coffee; good service. The food is classic, with a bit of spin. (I had the veg eggs Benedict, which had a hash-brown square instead of a English muffin; the bandana/blueberry pancakes were excellent - moist and puffy)  Unpretentious atmosphere, it is a true diner. Had to wait a bit, but this is expected at brunch on a Sunday. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's not the cleanest diner, but the food is great, service is fast and the staff are always polite and helpful. The price is unbeatable for breakfast. It's small, so sometimes you have to wait for a table.  Just don't use the washroom in the basement - it's really really gross."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, without the pretence. 
My office is around the corner, so I come in fairly regularly. The souvlaki is underrated - it's one of the best in the city. Not dry, and really, really well seasoned. 

The chef is the owner, and he's fantastic. His passion for food is obvious, and it shows in the cooking. This isn't a \"diner-concept\" - it's a diner. Good food at fair prices with good service. I wish there were more places like this in Toronto."}
{"text":"I wonder how many people have to repress themselves from saying something about this place being \"more than ok!\" or \"a-ok!\" or \"ok dokay!\". I bet EVERYONE. 

Anyway, it's been at least a year since I've been to this spot, and I'm not sure why. Maybe cause I'm too lazy to take a streetcar, or maybe cause I forgot about breakfast - EXCUSES ARE NOT WELCOME. I do remember this place charming my pants off and now that my pants are back around my waist, it's time to trek back.

Kat has a much better review of their awesome little menu - I do remember being pleased by eggs Brunhilde topping a perfect McD's style hashbrown - but I also recall a grilled peanut butter and banana sandwich that needs to be in my mouth asap. Pretty sure they have a brunch AND lunch menu, which not only rhymes but is very accommodating to those confused about what meal they feel like eating.

Love the little diner vibe, love the booths, love the bench outside that says \"OK\" on it. There aren't many seats, so if you arrive in peak brunch season/time, you'll have to wait a tick - but stick with it. Oh, the pancakes are apparently top-notch too. This is very important."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the Eggs Bernadette but it wasn't available when I visited. Got the breakfast with peameal ham and it was very good. Service is great. Not complaints

Will come back again to try the Eggs Bernadette"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have noted, it lives up to its name.

The food was pretty pretty good.  However, the side pancake I ordered was not fluffy; rather sad really.  I know I can screw up a pancake at home but you wouldn't expect this at a diner.

Having said that, I found the staff to be very pleasant.  I was offered coffee twice whilst I waited for a table to become available.

All in all good value for the buck.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We went for a late brunch on a Saturday afternoon, no line up, and got sunny spot on the patio, so it was looking good. Service was very slow, and the server was very quiet, but did come sometimes with water and coffee refills, which were plentiful through our long wait. We ordered the brunhilde and the regular two eggs breakfast. Poached eggs were awful, watery, either over
cooked or undercooked and broken open. Three pieces of burnt asparagus, and McDonald's style hash browns, which were not appreciated by anyone at the table. And the homemade hollandaise sauce? I didn't see any. There was a weird watery yellow film over it all. There was however, an incredibly generous portion of  smoked salmon, which really did save the whole thing, because that was delicious, but everything else was poorly executed. Also, my table mates and I were suffering from a serious jam shortage. We were only given two little packages for the table of five and when we asked for more jam we were given one more small package. Not a big deal, but it was strange.
The worst surprise was the bill at the end, this is not a cheap little diner! There are plenty of good places for brunch around these parts, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"It really is just ok (singular).

It's a tiny spot, especially in winter when the patio is closed. They have lots of stools at the bar where you can eat, or wait for a booth to become available. There are some old school televisions playing strange black and white programming. Interesting, but doesn't elevate the experience to more than one okay.

I've eaten there a few times as I live in the neighbourhood. Today I had the huervos which is a tortilla filled with eggs and black beans (theoretically), with salsa, sour cream and guac. I was disappointed to see there were no blackbeans - my tortilla was just full of so much egg.

I've had the oatmeal before which is massive and quite good. Way too much for one person though.

The hashbrowns truly are mccain hashbrown patties. They taste good, but you could have made them at home.

They're known for the \"Elvis is King\" - it's a peanut butter and banana sandwich dipped in egg and fried like french toast. Pretty interesting, and caloric.

The servers are nice and the food is alright. The reality is that there are several better brunch places within a stones throw of okay okay."}
{"text":"Food is typical of a diner. Service is straightforward. Small location so be prepared that they may not seat you. I arrived first and was told I couldn't be sat at a booth (no other spots were available) because I was by myself. I was leaving and the waiter proceeded to seat a couple who arrived after me. They might have doubled their business on that transaction but discouraged my future business."}
{"text":"Very much a \"diner,\" but good good food. Can't wait to sit on the patio in the spring."}
{"text":"Don't go in here expecting high class food. They serve simple breakfast and lunch meals. It is not above average, maybe not even average. But the price is right for what they serve and the staff is incredibly friendly. The ambience of this place makes it worth going to, if you love diners that is."}
{"text":"I like the vibe of this place, but the food was average.

Brown toast - a little thicker than usual, but no noticable grains or seeds.

Fried eggs - brown on edges, which one of my friends enjoyed, but that's not how eggs are supposed to be done.

\"Home fries\" - do you you like the McDonald's version?  You'll love these.  (The patty was ok, but I like real home fries.)

Coffee - typical diner coffee.

Service - waitress was attentive but unenthusiastic, until we engaged her and she came out of her shell.

We were basically the only ones in the place at 9:30 on a Monday morning, but the cook took a long time to make these basic breakfasts.  3 specials plus the Huevos....maybe the Huevos slowed him down."}
{"text":"Walking up and down Queen Street on my Leslieville excursion, I wanted something simple.  I decided to stop by this place as I was meeting my Cali sista at Te Aro. 

I always enjoy a place with a patio.  The seats were very colourful and the image on the wall of the streetcar intrigued me.  The server was very friendly.  I am not sure if it is family owned because there was a garden on the side.  

The lunch menu was pretty simple and so was the beer selection.  After all it was a diner.  I ordered the banquet burger.  I was so thirsty I didn't get a chance to ask for peameal bacon on my burger.  He didn't offer me the choice, so bacon it was. Also I ate fries with my fingers.  I didn't ask for cutlery and nor did he offer it.  I was kind of indifferent that day.  I only added ketchup with my burger. But with the condiments and the vegetables, it was a very messy burger.  

This place wasn't a first choice of mine.  But if I had more time, I'd prefer to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Organic fair trade coffee was good but no non-dairy option to go with it. Food was decent. The worst part was that our food came like 5 min after ordering and then we got asked to leave soon after because of the line up. Sorry but when people go for brunch they go to hang out. Not eat quickly and leave. I would not go back for brunch for that reason. I would rather wait in line at lady marmalade for 45 min and eat good food."}
{"text":"Honestly love this little place. It's exactly what you would expect but more. The service was so genuine! The food was actually decent! Expect the hash browns are odd. There not diced there just shaped similar to McDonald's. I wish they had different ones. Anyways
Went here for breakfast New Year's Day. Small place with only about 4-5 booths and the bar area. We were seated at the bar and told we would be in a booth soon. We were! Since the place is so small it gets cold when people come and go but the server was all over it shutting the door every time it opened! 
I would 100% go back for breakfast. Cheap, delicious and convenient!!

{"text":"Fun and friendly little joint in Leslieville / Queen East.
The server was spot-on when she told us the wait for a table would be ten minutes, as we arrived around 11:30 am. No problems there :)
Accommodated five adults plus a baby at the back booth.
Food was served quite quickly and was hot and delicious.
They asked one of us what his choice of toast was, but did not ask me, which didn't strike me as odd until my plate showed up with white toast. No matter, just a small detail.
Another friend's dish had a broken poached egg, so upon serving it, the chef said he'd bring another egg, intact, in a minute :) Not necessary, but appreciated nonetheless.
Bottomless coffee and cute diner. For more loungy feel, I wonder if it would be best to go when they open, or at the tail end of brunch? Felt obligated to pay and get out after eating, as there were a few people waiting for a table.
Most plates under $12. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Ok OK diner doesn't  really need the second \"OK\". I sat out on the patio which I was relieved to have some shade from the large umbrellas because I'm like a fat, british old person in hot weather (except I'm not fat, nor am I British. Maybe getting old). Anyway, my brain's melting in this heat. Inside did not appear to have a/c.
It took awhile to get a menu and one of the waitresses didn't seem too pleased to have new customers coming in. The waitress that served us was \"two\" okays.
I had the Eggs Beatrice which was, surprise \"OK\". I'm disappointed to read in the other review that they're store-bought hash browns. I figured they would be because they're shaped too perfectly. I would've chosen an older kind of cheese with more punch. The cheese that was in the sauce was a tad on the bland side.
I would give this place another shot but I might wait til it cools down."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday ......was pleasantly surprised by the friendly service, great diner food and comfortable surroundings ..... I will be back of breakfast soon."}
{"text":"Best burgers on Queen Street!  Perfect toppings-no changes necessary for me.  A bit messy -recommend a fork and knife!"}
{"text":"Yuck, its NOT ok ok to put eggs benny on a deep fried potato patty. Then top it with hollandaise from a can. So turned off, will not be back."}
{"text":"Hi all,

First review.  I was working in the area and was told to go here for great food.  I love the old diner feel this place has.  Table was clean, service was excellent.  I ordered the burger, cause why not at a diner.  It did not disappoint.  I even give the fries a thumbs up.  My friend ordered the juevos rancheros and he gave it a thumbs up.  Said the eggs were creamy and delicious.

Good food, great price, great service, great time.  4 stars.

Drew"}
{"text":"Two words: real hollandaise. *3.5 stars.

If you can't tell the difference between that God-awful fake stuff and the real deal and you're an eggs Benny devotee, then this place will won't do it for you. However, if you know where your towel is at, then you should check out this place.

Despite being very busy on a Sunday morning, the staff were extremely friendly, even witty, and on their service game. 

The vibe is retro-cool meets, well, diner. Black and white tube TVs playing CP24 was a great touch.

And the food it really hit the spot. Certainly not the best I've ever had, Benny or other, but really solid. I can see why this is a busy neighbourhood joint and I'm a little jealous."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood diner, inexpensive and consistently good food! Love their skinny fries!!"}
{"text":"We just had breakfast here and it was quite busy on a Friday afternoon. I'm not sure if it's because OK OK Diner was one of the very few places open during that time, or because they are actually that popular. We walk by this place all the time. 

My fiancé ordered their eggs Bernadette ($11.99), which is two poached eggs on sautéed spinach, peameal bacon, and hash browns, served with a side of toast. The eggs Bernadette is topped with freshly made bernaise sauce. The eggs were poached with a gadget and shaped almost too perfectly. I couldn't notice the bernaise sauce on the benedict, but my fiancé really seemed to enjoy it. Everything being placed on a hash brown was a cool idea. I thought the toasted was a bit of an overkill and personally would have preferred a salad. 

I ordered the pork schnitzel on a bun with a side of fries ($12.99). The pork schnitzel was really good. It came with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and a spicy sauce. The spicy sauce was actually very spicy, to the point where I needed to ask for a glass of water. The pork schnitzel was very tasty and cooked well. I just wish the pork itself was a bit bigger. Fries were shoestring and I was told they're cut in house. 

Service was quick and efficient, but not overly friendly. Coffee was constantly refilled, which is much appreciated. I ordered an orange juice and found it was kind of expensive at $4 for a small glass. Especially when it isn't squeezed in house."}
{"text":"I wasn't very happy with the experience nor food. Their eggs Benni was disgusting. Will not be coming back here again. 

Def not top breakfast joint as blog to states."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars until this morning. We get to this tiny place and all the booths are taken, one of the main servers ( woman with shoulder length hair) was setting up outdoor patio tables, we asked if we could sit there? We were told I'm not ready? Instead of saying sure, I'll grab you a coffee and keep setting up and I'll take your order from you shortly once I'm done. We were a tad freaked that she would say this to regulars who tip this person very well, we left and went to what is now our favourite new breakfast spot. In this day and age, this kind of incompetent service will close the doors. The food was always served tasty but luke warm. Ok,ok, good-bye, good-bye."}
{"text":"Not okay to sit with an empty coffee cup for 15 minutes. Not okay to offer a potato patty reminiscent of hangover remedy from McDonalds circa 1989. Not okay to have an indifferent waitress. Not okay when forced to leave the comfort of the lovely  patio to hunt  down some ketchup for aforementioned pre-frozen patty. Not okay to be without caffeine and adequate service while the customers across the street at Stratengers are laughing and talking and clearly enjoying a quick cheerful breakfast at half the price. Not going back. Not okay at all."}
{"text":"pretty typical diner, I went a few times for breakfast going with the sausage and eggs. nothing really stood out, average food and not overly cheap or expensive. may return again if in the area"}
{"text":"I don't want to say that my taste buds are better than anybody else's, but anyone who says that this place is just 'ok' has crappy taste buds. Even if you have tried better spots, Ok Ok Diner is certainly better than just okay. 

I had their version of the eggs benedict; the one with the pea meal, hash browns, and poached eggs - it was very tasty. The pancakes were also quite enjoyable.

My girlfriend had the smoked salmon version of the eggs benedict, and she also thoroughly enjoyed her meal.   

To top it off our server was great! Charming guy, but didn't seem like he was trying too hard. You know the type.

I have visited at least 12-15 breakfast joints around the city and I would put this up there in the 'very good experience' category.

I generally wouldn't waste 7 minutes of my work day to give a restaurant a shout out, but they deserve it.

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Had the Heuvos here.  It was good.  It's described as being scrambled eggs, but it's really more like an egg omelette wrapped in a tortilla with some blackbeans spread between the eggs and tortilla to help it stick.  They roll it up and put a dallop each of guacamole, sour cream and salsa.  And ta da!

My BF had their version of eggs benny, but it's served on a hash brown, like the ones that McDonald's has instead of an english muffin.  The poached eggs were made with a mould!

I don't feel like the food is made from scratch or anything.  Of the choices available in leslieville, this one is not as good as some of the other places in the hood."}
{"text":"The Eggs Bernadette are a revelation. Poached eggs on top of wilted spinach, peameal bacon, and a hash brown, all covered with bearnaise sauce. The peameal is beautifully seared, the pork fat rendered out and impregnating the spinach, hash brown, and sauce. There's a wonderful flavour of slightly sweet, perfectly browned pork that runs through the entire dish - a flavour I normally associate with Chinatown, like roast pork from BBQ joints or deep fried pork dumplings at dim sum. Entirely unexpected at brunch, but entirely delicious."}
{"text":"The meal I had here was 'ok' at best, used to be Tony's a greasy spoon that made a damn good greasy spoon breakfast for like $5. 
It seems to be some sort of hipster idiot attempt at a greasy spoon, meaning the food was bland and lower than my expectations and at the end of it I paid through my anus.

Eggs bene and a glass of OJ ran me more than $20 with a tip. 
I have never gone back nor would I."}
{"text":"Many options & vegetarian heaven!  I love all day breakfast & can't complaint about anything except the waitress made me feel that 10% tips is not enough for a simple meal with minimum service.  Food portion was big, took half for lunch next day.  Juice is expensive, $4 a glass but freshly squeeze.  Good place to go for lunch as most places in Leslieville opens after 5pm on weekdays!"}
{"text":"This place has become one of my standards anytime I head out to Beach area.  Maybe it's not phenomenal but I am always pleased with the food here.  It's breakfast.  It's enough to get to my next destination on Queen East.  And to be honest, they have a better cup of coffee than most other breakfast places.  

It's an easy atmosphere I haven't had to wait."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very nice bearnaise sauce over poached eggs with spinach and peameal on hash browns."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but I didn't.  It started with our server who was insincere but who 'didn't do anything wrong.'  It's true, she did everything she was supposed to, just in an unfriendly, insincere way.
  
The good:
- It's close to my house (but I'm never going here again)
- The fries are good
- It's reasonably priced
- The old TVs above the bar are cool
- The music is good
- Texas toast was super thick and awesome

The bad:
- It took over 20 minutes for us to get our food, on a weekday
- The hashbrowns are patties a-la McCain hashbrowns - I'm not saying they ARE the McCain hashbrown patties, but they are the same style of potato and I want real potatoes
- It smells weird in here - something acrid - I can't put my finger on it, but I was alarmed that I so quickly got used to it
- They don't use top quality ingredients in the all day breakfast; frozen hashbrown patties, thin, fatty supermarket bacon and small eggs
- Waitress doesn't like me or Kat apparently, but is super friendly to 2 guys who come in and sit at the bar making me feel like I have to be a regular to get good service here

My food here wasn't very good, and it wasn't cheap enough for me to be okay with that.  I asked for crispy bacon and one piece was burnt in the middle so much that I could have crumbled it into a salad.  My eggs were poached too hard and you know how I feel about the hashbrown patty.  The waitress asked how everything was and I said it was just okay.  She further inquired and offered to make me new eggs, but I was kind of over this place by then and I declined.  I found her insincere and resentful. 

I will never come here again.  I hear they have a good Benny though.  If you want to go without me."}
{"text":"I think it's pretty fitting that OK OK gets an A-OK for being pretty much OK. 

On a recent holiday to T.O. I stayed with friends in Leslieville and this little number was the first place I grabbed grub, the first place I ever ate in Toronto actually! (I like to set the bar at just OK). 

New to the neighbourhood I wasn't certain what to expect, but I figured \"hey it's diner fare... how bad could it be?\" Colour me impressed, not bad at all. I think it's pretty hard to screw up eggs though which were scramble-y good - cooked through but not tough as leather. The taters, ohhh the taters... that's where things fell flat. You know those frozen \"hash browns\" that McDonald's tries to pass off as real food? (Food shouldn't come in index card shape.) Well these are those potatoes. Sort of disappointing, but a pancake with chocolate chips and a super friendly server (sorry I can't remember her name) more than made up for fake hash. Actually my server was the best part about this place. She had a very Frances McDormand Fargo sort of feel... constant smile, overly pleasant, up on all her booths. I liked her, she's the reason I went back to try lunch which I won't share too much detail about because I think breakfast is where they really thrive. Except in tater territory remember. 

Breakfast is best, just stick to the basics and you'll be A-OK."}
{"text":"Good diner-y breakfast foods. The old TVs behind the counter are a nice touch but otherwise decor is basic diner. Their various versions of eggs Benedict all come on has browns rather than an English muffin. A bit weird but it works. Hollandaise is quite good. 

The egg burrito could use more beans but was fine. Coffee isn't superb but isn't bad. Service is quick and pleasant

Overall, a decent diner breakfast/lunch place. I don't know if a place like this could ever be super-impressive but there's little to complain about."}
{"text":"A great wee diner in this very bohemian neighbourhood. The owner correctly identified us as coming from Glasgow (2 stars right away for that!) and consequently much cheery banter ensued. 

I had the 'Elvis is King', manly because I was curious to see what Challah Toast was. It turned out to be French toast (eggy bread) covered in peanut butter with banana, with a cinnamon dusting and grilled with an egg topping. Very yummy, but completely overshadowed by my 2 ladies' choice of Eggs Brunhilde - 2 poached eggs balanced on asparagus spears on a bed of smoked salmon and hash browns, with hollandaise sauce. A visual and taste breakfast masterpiece - I was instantly jealous!

Great food, great service and the price is definitely right. A big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I sort of liked this place... and it sounds like I am sort of alone on that sentiment. Ok Ok Diner is a cute little place with an awesome super bright side patio. I always get their tasty and filling huevos rancheros and the service has always been quick and friendly (although I have only gone for brunch on weekdays)."}
{"text":"Decent diner. I had Huevos. My friend had Eggs Bernadette. It was okay; nothing special."}
{"text":"Great diner.  Great milkshakes, burgers, fries  (big portions of excellent properly fried fries!)"}
{"text":"The Chocolate Elvis (banana, peanut butter, honey and nutella) on an incredible pairing of egg bread slices is so, so good, but for $7 less I can make it for myself at home and skip the surly service that, along with too-long lineups on weekends, has become a fixture at this slightly overrated diner."}
{"text":"Consistently good.  Food, staff and atmosphere are great.  Go to breakfast joint in Leslieville.

Only drawback are the exceptional small booths, and the frozen McDonald's style hashbrowns, but other than that, great place."}
