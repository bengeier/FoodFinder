{"text":"I love the atmosphere here, it's very chill. Their coffee isn't bad and the service is pretty good. Also, they are open \"late\", so that's an added bonus if you need to make a coffee run at 11 at night"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite cafe to get work done. Closes at midnight and plenty of indoor/outdoor seating. Need a study break? Order a panini and salad. Getting sleepy? Grab one of their caffeinated drinks. Nice employees, clean bathrooms, a laid-back atmosphere--what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Really good coffee and sandwiches.  The restaurant is nestled downtown and has plenty of room for seating inside and out."}
{"text":"Man was I disappointed by my experience here.  I've been wanting to go for awhile and planned to eat lunch and work for awhile but they have really bad / rude customer service.     Backstory:  I fell into one of those awkward situations where my card was declined.  So I kinda laughed/ cringed, took a few steps away from the counter (despite no one being in line or around me) and looked up my balance quickly on my phone to make sure it was fine.  It was.    So I said, \"do you think it's the machine?  Could you type it in or run it again? I double checked my balance and it's fine\".  The woman said \"no I don't need to run it again.  Your card was rejected.  Deal with it.  Call the bank if you want.  But leave.  I need you to leave the counter now\"  Whoa there Miss Angst, I truly wasn't being remotely hostile, I just thought she could try to type in my number since I know the card is ok.    But thanks anyway for throwing a little negativity my way.  Last time I'll come here.  I did check my bank btw and they told me that no failed transaction even made it to their system.  They said it could have been a bad reader but the person also may have just entered it wrong (apparently since the chip is new, lots of times people just remove it too quickly).  All that is understandable but her attitude and the aggression in her voice wasn't."}
{"text":"I stopped in with 8 friends during April 2012 along a road trip between Iowa and Ohio, because we saw the great Yelp reviews.  Cafe Kopi did not disappoint!    My husband had the bacon tuna melt and I had the pesto turkey panini - both were excellent.  I like that they come with Sun Chips instead of the typical potato chips, and you get a couple carrot bites on the side as well.  Husband got the last cup of tomato asparagus bisque and it was sooo tasty that he kindly declined to rave about it at the table so no one would be jealous that he was the only one who got some.  We all finished off with some sweets.  I had a small ginger spice cookie - just the right size for a sweet flavor without being too heavy.  My chai tea latte was very tasty as well, it was just a little too sweet for me so I didn't finish it, but very good!  Everyone seemed quite pleased with such nice food and atmosphere in the middle of a 9 hour drive.  A nice break from fast food; much healthier but still very affordable and the staff was very friendly too."}
{"text":"My go-to coffee place for study sessions, hangout/meetups or even just a coffee. Love the ambience. The barristers are super friendly, the place is nice. To top it, they usually have some daily specials on expresso drinks!"}
{"text":"The best service ever! Once I came here extremely sick and I kept coughing. The servers kept hearing me cough from the other room and made me free hot tea for my throat! That definitely took my by surprise and I can't say I've met nicer servers."}
{"text":"i adore kopi. i really do. i enjoy the space itself (with its dim lighting and open layout) and the people who frequent it. they're usually friendly enough that if it's ever packed, you can always ask someone if you can sit with them and not fear the usual looks of contempt/disdain/indifference. it's a relief. their selection is the best in town, too. feeling like chocolate covered, gluten-free pretzels? any number of teas you can think of when you're crashing at eleven pm and need a pick-me-up? kombucha? fairly wide array of sandwiches?   that said, i've never had much luck with their coffee and espresso pulls. they're either overly bitter or too weak. can't catch a break there. if i want a really well-execute americano, my drink of choice, i go to paradiso, but at 3.30 a pop there, i try to keep it to a minimum (all the while convincing myself, uselessly, that my kidneys would love a little vacation from caffeine). honestly, though, the rest of their drinks make up for their so-so coffee. i've never had a latte or cappuccino there, so who knows.  their baristas, however, really get to me. i've worked in retail. i've worked as a barista for a few years. i just moved down here after working at a grocery store in the north shore of chicago for two years. i know what crappy customers can be like, but the attitude some of these baristas give? no hello, no thank you, no smile. it's really awkward/strange and off-putting enough that i will avoid the place some nights. i went in last night, and the girl said absolutely nothing to me and looked absolutely pissed. what is that? i look forward to going coffeeshops (and looked forward to working AT them) exactly because i love the random chit-chat and banter with the baristas. or even just a smile. is asking 'how are you' always coming from a place of sincere interest? no. but when i was 21, i realized that wasn't the point. take your pretension elsewhere. i used to despise the idea of customer service, but cafe kopi, you continually fail at this. enough for me to write an entry on yelp. having a couple baristas who are really cool/friendly doesn't make up for the majority of smug, non-talkative workers."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for years, and Cafe Kopi has never failed to impress.  Their coffee and tea is superb (my favorite being the chai bombs), and the food isn't half-bad either.  I particularly enjoy the basket of sliced pitas with hummus - their hummus is amazing!  Also, the \"pots of tea\" are great.  I'd suggest that anyone spending time in downtown Champaign come here!"}
{"text":"Having basically moved in here during last semester, I must rave about it! Great atmosphere with regulars and they don't mind if you camp out. I second the praise of the Mediterranean sandwich too! All they need is to start serving chocolate cookie scones and I'll be in paradise..."}
{"text":"I like the idea of Cafe Kopi, but the drink are less then impressive. On the plus side, there's ample seating!"}
{"text":"Cafe kopi has the best cappuccino's in champaign/urbana. The staff knows what they are doing and they are the only coffee shop to use beans from the fantastic local roastery \"Columbia street roastery.\"  Coming from a coffee snob, this place *could* do better in the espresso department. Something is just not right about the espresso; it has a metallic taste. Machine needs cleaning perhaps? Needs filtered water?"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwiches for lunch--great Mediterranean and grilled cheese + tomato sandwiches."}
{"text":"Kopi has good coffee and a really nice atmosphere. However, they are much more expensive than many shops of similar quality in the area. I used to be a regular here, but stopped going once they raised prices even higher."}
{"text":"Although the coffee was quite good, it is yet another example of service in CU.  I make it a point to see how long the staff can go without saying anything...like hello, or can I help you, or at the end, thank you.  Not a word, and I even gave them a tip!  I'd rather go to starbucks where at least you'd expect that poor service.  Avoid until they get over themselves."}
{"text":"Lots of tables and great selection of drinks.  The music is softer than a few other places in town.  Sometimes a little cold.  Around lunch time, it can be hard to find a table.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I have been a Kopi customer for years. I have been pretty pleased with most things I have ingested there, but the curried egg salad pita is my fave!! For one thing, where else can you get this?? And the presentation is beautifulll"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Amazing coffee, some of the best I've ever had. Very unique flavor. Incredibly helpful and friendly staff. Everything I ordered was suggested to me by the man taking my order. The turkey sandwich he suggested was absolutely delicious. Wish I lived closer so that I could come here more often!"}
{"text":"I really would want to avoid this place because of the service.  EVERY time I've been here, they always get something wrong. Wrong pastry (they have a fly problem in their pastry case...), wrong drink. I just feel that the aren't very attentive.  First of all, it was sweltering outside and I ordered iced mochas. One with soy, one regular. What I got were 2 tall glass cups with cardboard sleeves on them with hot drinks. Ugh. How refreshing...at this point I don't care anymore to get it corrected and I hate to waste perfectly good espresso and milk. That and I feared it would take forever for another since it took her forever to even pull the espresso and put in the chocolate. I dunno, new hire?  The drinks are fine, just all my experiences turn me off to Cafe Kopi."}
{"text":"Cafe Kopi is one of the better cafs in town.  Loads better than Espresso Royal, Panera, and Starbucks for sure.  I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could give half-stars.  Cafe Kopi buys their coffee from the Columbia Street Roastery and the CSR is an excellent roastery.  It is a pleasure to be able to go and get a coffee drink that doesn't taste like the beans were burned.  I find their coffee to be robust without being bitter.  Their chai is some of the best in town.  Their apple cider, however, is stale  (store bought, non-local and just heated up from what I can tell) but I guess that's not exactly a hot ticket item.  I have a problem with their pastry case because on MANY occasions there have been multiple flies buzzing around inside the case and landing on all of the food.  That is not so tasty to me.  My personal preference in caf atmospheres is one where each table feels like a cozy and isolated space and I do not find that Kopi's atosphere lends any feeling of coziness or isolation.  All of chairs are made of wood, so it may not accomidate the armchair and comfy couch types.  Many people go there to be seen and table hop, so I guess it works for most.  I prefer the outside tables in the summer as long as the homeless lady doesn't come by and ask for $2."}
{"text":"I view myself as a coffee shop aficionada, and this place is my favorite!  I love the decor, laid back atmosphere, complimentary cucumber or orange-infused water, and hot drinks - especially the mate latte."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Kopi for a number of years. However, the expansion has made it much more comfortable to stay and have a drink. The coffee is always decent. I enjoy the tuna melt as well. Both are not fantastic but very solid. However, I love their chai bomb. It elevates my rating from 3 to 4.  Although I would love a 3.5. Depending on the day, I sub in orange cinnamon tea for the chai teabag in the chai bomb. Highly recommended. Kopi is always a place to stop when in the CU area."}
{"text":"Had a nice experience at this shop tonight- the two staff members behind the counter were friendly and gladly explained the evenings brewed options to me.  My coffee was not hot- thus 4 stars- but when I mentioned they may want to brew a fresh hot pot they thanked me and offered to brew some fresh for me immediately if I had a minute to wait, i gladly accepted.  Great decor and atmosphere  And they're open til 12 AM! Great place to hang out late :)"}
{"text":"Kopi's okay, but there's nothing to really recommend it over any of the other coffee shops. The beverages are better than Espresso Royale, but I'd rather drink at Dunkin Donuts than Espresso. I have friends who really like the atmosphere, but I don't like studying in public, so I can't really say. I do like their baked goods, and the location is really nice, as are the outdoor seats."}
{"text":"I like this place because it has pretty decent coffee and if I want to get out of the office, I can get some work done here. Hip and what not but still a good place. Don't order the food unless you are desperate."}
{"text":"Oh, Cafe Kopi. I want to love you, I really do, but I'll be damned if you ain't something that works better in theory than in practice.  Kopi is really quite lovely inside; the smells are wonderful, the decor is pleasing. The drinks are generally at least satisfactory, sometimes downright excellent (the cafe miel, when done well, is heavenly). The food is good, especially the lox and cream cheese on a bagel. Umph. God, so tasty. I come from Washington, so I know good salmon. The prices are a little higher than I would like, but then I am poor and cheap, so you might not want to trust my judgment in such matters.  I really, really can't get right with the atmosphere in this place, though. I've tried, but no dice. Sometimes I'll step inside expecting to sit and read for a half-hour or so, but I never follow through with that desire; except for those times when I've been with friends, I've never stayed longer than it takes to order and grab my drink. First, there are the 20 gazillion students with laptops, which would not make me so grouchy if I didn't constantly encounter solitary people taking up all the room at tables meant for four or more with their  prodigious crap. Put some of that shit on the floor. I promise that your bag is not going to suffer hurt feelings if it doesn't get to sit in the chair across from you. Second, the service here is pretty iffy. Every third member of the staff is friendly and helpful. The rest display this cold, huffy Midwestern Hipster variety of unpleasantness that makes me grind my teeth. Having your order taken by some guy in cutoffs and boat shoes who remains silent and stares at the wall during the entire transaction is a shitty experience. Come on, dude. You're picking up my napkins and washing my plate after I leave. You're not better than me.  So, I dunno, I'm torn. On one hand I love the fact that there's a place near my apartment where I can duck out of the cold for a few moments and get a hot drink, and on the other hand I hate that the vibe in said place is unwelcoming.  But lord almighty, that lox."}
{"text":"Kopi's is a fine indie coffeeshop. Great location in downtown Champaign, and I like the rough, exposed wood, unfinished tables interior. I tried their Med. sandwich, and the pesto was amazing (although it was a rather small sandwich for the price). They just need to work on spacing. Far too many large tables were filled with one student and a laptop."}
{"text":"Turkey Brie sandwich -  Wow, it's amazing. Gluten free, not a problem, their GF free bread is incredible."}
{"text":"Quaint and relaxing college coffee shop.  Great layout where you do not feel on top of the table next to you. Most importantly, pretty decent coffee and bagels."}
{"text":"Acceptable (not amazing coffee), acceptable (not amazing sandwiches/snacks), good service staff, great people watching. Perfectly place for grading/studying."}
{"text":"Champaign's best coffee house. The indoors is spacious enough to feel comfortable in and outdoors if you are with your friends. Great place to start an evening. Grab a coffee and a beer, I do!"}
{"text":"The baristas are nice, the coffee is good, and the atmosphere is perfectly comfortable for reading or studying. You don't get that uncomfortable feeling that they're waiting for you to leave once you've finished your coffee.   The sandwiches are a little expensive for the portion size, but they're delicious."}
{"text":"I don't know. This place seems a little tragic to me; the self-consciously arty vibe inside and the affected hipsters behind the counter are aggressively mannered, but also a little frayed around the edges. It's like a very good diorama of a coffee shop made by someone who has seen one in a movie or read about one in a book.  The coffee is just ok."}
{"text":"Good coffee and hot drinks. Breakfast menu leaves a bit to be desired. Something other than pastries?"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed.  I had the turkey pesto panini.  It was OK, but definitely overpriced, and very short on turkey.  My wife had the ham and swiss.  She didn't think to ask what was on it, and was extremely surprised with rye bread (makes her sick), onion, and what smelled like a vinegar based sauce.  The drinks were OK, I had a spiced cider that tasted good, but not great.  She had chai tea, and it seemed to lack flavor compared to a typical chai.  It was relatively quiet, so we were able to eat without being disturbed.  It's definitely small though, so if it gets busy, there would likely be no room to work with.  I wish we wouldn't have had to pay for parking, but that's just an extra cost of eating downtown.  Until the city stops charging for parking, there isn't much to do about that.  Overall, nothing bad.  But as the two star rating indicates, \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Decent cafe. Their brewed coffee was good enough, but I was no fan of their espresso drinks or much of their meals. The exception is their turkey pesto, which was always enjoyable.  Their space is nice but usually packed. I love how they exhibit work by local artists.   I never felt comfortable spending too long there because of the crowd, both because it was packed and because of rising guilt for taking up a space for too long. One way to cure this was to sit outside, which is a nice enough space save for the smokers. I'd be out there until the weather became intolerable at both extremes.  They also used to turn off Wifi at peak hours, but I'm not sure whether they still do.  Overall, a bit overhyped for my tastes. I never had an issue with staff, though. There are better options for the working grad student out there, especially when people just out for a coffee or meal come piling in."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  It was recommended to me by some friends, and when I walked up at 6:30pm on a Monday night, by the number of people sitting outside I thought no way would I get a seat to study.  Low and behold, as I open the door, great music floods my ears, fabulous decorations, and air conditioning.  And open tables.  I order a house coffee to start off with, and after I taste it I am horrified at what I've been drinking out of my Mr. Coffee in the mornings.  I grab a table next to a wall, and next to the place where the cook the food.  And right over the air conditioning vent.  I really don't study well when I'm hot, so the air conditioning was a huge plus.  The food smelled great, the lighting was perfect, it wasn't too loud with people talking, but the soft background noise helped me to focus and study.  I tried the pesto turkey panini which was fabulous.  And they wear gloves when they make your sandwhiches.  And cute garnishes.  And the coffee was reasonably price (I always think paying over $5 for a sandwhich is a little too much, but you're paying for wifi and atmosphere as well... and supporting a local busines... so...  I suppose it's worth it).  Overall I plan to spend many a weeknight there studying and drinking coffee (although I may have to switch to decaf because I was up way too late after that!)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Okay, not all tables and chairs are created equal.  I ended up sitting at a very uncomfortable table.  Now if I was just there hanging out with friends and playing a game or something, I probably wouldn't have cared.  But I was trying to read and study, and sometimes I fidget or sit cross-legged on the chair, but the table had these panels on it that made it too short to do either.  And the tables that look out the glass front window are great to people watch, but once it gets dark the lighting is pretty low.  To visit and chat- no problem.  But studying- towards the back would be better.  Luckily someone left and I grabbed a different table.  But still, great coffee, music, and good place to go.  I still definitely recommend.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I was here the other night, and maybe it was a fluke last time, but there was plenty of lighting by the tables in the front, by the windows...  Just FYI.  And I still love their turkey panini!!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I prefer their house coffee to their \"Coffee of the Day\".  I still haven't found a \"Coffee of the Day\" that I prefer to their house coffee."}
{"text":"Their coffee is always consistently good and the staff are always very friendly. Their food is not bad and I am a fan of their soups. This is definitely one of the better coffee houses in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"This is a great study spot with good coffee. It has a great cozy-coffee shop feel. They have a lot of power outlets and the music is not overpowering. My favorite thing to get here is the chai tea latte. The customers have this mutual understanding that it is a study spot. If you need to cram many hours for an exam kopi provides the right environment."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee in town. I'm one of those daily visitors to Kopi that just never thought to Yelp. I appreciate their consistent presence in downtown Champaign. Staff is always on point. While I rarely vary from my large light roast, or large iced coffe, I do dig the yummy no frills doughnut selection, and the Tuna Melt is hella good (though I go no bacon on it) I think the 4 other cafes in Downtown Champaign are also winners (Flying Machine in downtown Urbana Rules) , I'm a Kopi Guy!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots I've found during my time in C-U. Whether you're hanging out with friends, relaxing, or trying to get some work done, Cafe Kopi is the best in town. The staff is extremely knowledgable and helpful and I've yet to be disappointed by a drink or pastry purchased here. My only regret is that I had started coming here sooner in my academic career so I could've spent more nights studying here drinking great coffee."}
{"text":"Alright... Cafe Kopi deserves its full 5 stars. You'd almost forget you're in Champaign for a second. The interior is pretty big, with a large room in the back and free wireless... Relaxed laid-back atmosphere, cool music, friendly service. I'm sipping a mocha right now (pretty good I must say... sounds like Beirut?) and nibbling on a slice of blueberry bread (very yummy), and I already know that this is a place I will be visiting often after I move here (ouch!). Great coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Really great food! Chai latte is yummy and not too sweet. The chicken salad and sugar cookies are delicious. Food presentation is fantastic. Food is way better than Espresso Royale (saran wrap = no go). Service is prompt and usually cheerful. Leave them a good tip!   The space is great... if you can poach a table. Multiple times I've had to go around the corner to a different cafe because there just aren't enough tables. Crowd is diverse (not just students), though some people can be rudely loud. Art on the walls is all right -- it changes a lot during the year. Music can be great, or horrible (two hours of Bjork do not a great study time make).  For those who bike, there are racks on the curb. For those who drive, it's 25¢ an hour two blocks north next to the parking lot."}
{"text":"Great mochas.  Very tasty.   We're from Portland, Oregon and I was worried about finding good coffee in Champaign.  Not to worry - Cafe Kopi has great local coffee, nice atmosphere, and yummy looking food.  Worth the walk from campus."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee places in Champaign. Great relaxing atmosphere to enjoy with friends."}
{"text":"A cute little cafe in downtown champaign. I have always wanted to stop in after hearing many people rave about the eclectic atmosphere. During the beautiful weather this weekend I took a walk here to see what all the buzz was about! I had a peach and a raspberry Italian soda (thank god for boyfriends who let you order for them so you can try two things). I am a huge fan of fizzy water so they were both great! There was a larger than usual cafe food selection as well that I hope to try one day.   My only complaint was that the place was a little crammed! But I had very high expectations going in, so overall wonderful(:"}
{"text":"It's all in the details. I was short on cash so I ordered two iced small caramel lattes, and they were so thoughtful to not give me too much ice without my having to ask. The drinks themselves were rich and delicious. Their ice water was wonderful with sliced citrus fruit in it I think, and their sugar cookie with frosting tasted like my mom's. They seemed a tad expensive, but if I can get what I pay for served with a smile I really don't mind. They had a lot of variety in food it looked like, which from what I read is on the expensive side, but I will have to taste it to see what it is like. I tend to drink espresso drinks and not coffee so don't know about that topic here yet."}
{"text":"EASILY the best Espresso for at least a 100 mile radius. The coffee at Kopi is wicked good. For coffee lovers, this is one of the few places in the mid-west (apart from Soma in Bloomington IN) where they actually know how to both extract espresso correctly AND heat the milk perfectly. Depending on the barista you might even get some pretty foam/crema art action going on. Love it."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and tea collection. Pastries and biscotti were stale. I asked for a toasted croissant and was refused. They use margarine in their pastries (see photo). Customer service curt."}
{"text":"Like everyone else said, it's a good place to study (though be careful which table you choose, some are wobbly). Everyone who works here is super nice and the little pots of teas are perfect for the winter. The coffee is decent, too. I will say that I am not a fan of the food here. I think it's overpriced and sloppy. The baked goods especially are almost inedible- I wish they would just get pastries from Pekara a block away! Once I had an oreo brownie here, and it was beyond terrible. Still, I'm giving it 4 stars because I like it for coffee and studying."}
{"text":"I go here a lot because I live nearby.  There are some things I like, but I don't understand the management's shrill and defensive attitude toward the customers.  They post a remarkable newsletter that always explains why they cannot do anything about the most frequent customer complaints (flies in the pastry case, the deteriorating floor, and more).  Let's take one example:  The flies in the pastry case.  They've posted a long letter on the wall about how nothing can be done about the flies in the pastry case because it isn't safe to use insecticide near pastry.  OK... maybe that time could be spent to kill the flies and keep the pastry case closed?  They act like flies are an insurmountable puzzle never before encountered by anyone else.  Try a flyswatter.  Or a trap that doesn't use insecticide (like the sticky ones).  Or buy a larger insect zapper.  But I think they'd rather write notes to us about how they will change nothing.  I still go there because there aren't that many nearby cafes.  The staff are very nice and the Curried Egg Salad Pita is good.  I just wish the missives from the owner weren't so hostile (large print Wi-Fi restrictions, defensive explanations of why certain smoothies aren't profitable, and so on).  Also I wish the dim lighting and the weak espresso could be improved.  But the bagels are good.   I put \"no\" on the Wi-Fi because they restrict it on certain days to prevent studying.  It's a mixed bag."}
{"text":"Great place for late night studying since they're open until midnight! I love the big room with little lamps at the tables. Also, a very friendly staff and great coffee, of course."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a cappuccino and a little dessert after a big dinner.  While not a huge selection of desserts, I got a mixed berry slice of pie which was pretty good.  Cappuccino was also perfectly acceptable and hit the spot.  I like the outdoor tables.  My little brother got solicited for cash by a street peddler (another patron complained to the barista and it looked like the management was going to talk to the individual but the guy walked off).  There's a lot of little coffee shops in the downtown Champaign area but I liked the vibe of Café Kopi."}
{"text":"I am particular about coffee. Stopped here with my family and had a house brew, black. It was the best coffee I have ever had. The flavor was delicious and smooth. I will stop here whenever I am in Champaign."}
{"text":"This place is by all measures the best coffee shop I've ever been to.  I live in coffee shops.  I've been to almost every one in Champaign/Urbana and many in Chicago.  This one will always be my favorite.  In the many hours I have spent studying, talking, eating, and just sitting in Kopi I have always felt warm.  They have just the right mix of unusual sandwiches, homemade pastries, weird drinks, dcor, and staff to make the perfect atmosphere.  With so much variety of food and drink there is always something new to try.  And every cappuccino I've had there was expertly prepared; this is NOT Starbucks.  I like that it us just far enough from campus to keep it from being a kids hangout.  Parking is a little tough sometimes, but that's normal for the town.  It's small too, so sometimes you can't find a seat.  They have a great collection of antique tables and chairs that adds to the homey feel.  In true caf style, the art on the walls is always changing.  And, just to make sure they don't miss one aspect of a perfect caf, the walls are lined with outlets for your computer.  They're open late for long study hours and, even though everyplace gets crowded near finals, the staff has never bothered me about staying too long.  To show my gratitude I make sure to stop in every time I get back to Champaign."}
{"text":"You're growing on me, Kopi.  Night times are great to study here, or cold rainy days.  Also, the tuna bacon melt is the greatest thing in the universe.  Another fun thing: If you order a sandwich or food item, the staff will write down your physical description for the server to bring it to you.  One day I saw him write \"glasses, blue sweater, beard--\"  And I simply said, \"You could just say, 'guy with big afro.'\"  He looked up sheepishly and said, \"Yeah, I thought about it, but this seemed least likely to be offensive.\"  I let him know it *wasn't* offensive, and this Afro-wearer was happy to get a delicious Kopi sandwich.  Also, scotch enthusiasts:  they serve it.  I know.  Odd.  But delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and have been vacationing for the past 3 weeks, stopping for coffee during our 4000 miles, and they served the best, most authentic cappuccino so far."}
{"text":"They have really great drinks along with a great, comfortable atmosphere.  The barista are also really friendly and nice. I was also pleasantly surprised when they played Daft Punk's Discovery album."}
{"text":"Cafe Kopi's ok.... I mean they have a great environment and well roasted beans but they just can't get the prep right. They're far better than Starbucks and Espresso but not nearly as good as Aroma Cafe and Cafe Paradiso.   At Kopi a latte is espresso with warmed up milk, not steamed milk. The espresso's also not as good as it could be. I've bought their beans and made stuff at home. It turned out pretty well but every time I go there for a cup of coffee it tastes stale. I really don't know what they're doing back there.  I don't think they have any idea how to make espresso beverages either. They have a grinder but it's manual and when manual grinders are used improperly they make horrible espresso...   Basically if you can get past the really really bad coffee then go here, but I can't.   If only we could combine Aroma Cafe and Cafe Kopi. Then downtown Champaign would finally have the perfect coffee house."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I always stop in when I'm in town (which isn't very often).  The drinks are always delicious.  This last trip was the first time I got food, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  My tuna pita was very good, and the turkey pesto panini my husband had was DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Delicious green tea latte, very cozy, tasty food options. I visited over 10 years ago and still loved my experience! The workers were very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. I had an iced cafe mocha. It was delicious! I love the culture of this place and everyone was very friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When I think of Champaign I think of Cafe Kopi. It has that cool, hipster coffee shop vibe that I crave. I like their coffee, but I LOVE their selection of teas and treats, and their food is phenomenal too! I recommend trying the Red Latte and Chicken Salad Pita. Those are my favorites.   Whenever I need a place to relax I choose Kopi. Although it's almost always busy it's usually very quiet and everyone keeps to themselves, so it's a very comfortable atmosphere. I also love the local artists' works that are displayed on every wall, and they change the displays pretty frequently.  Also....the poetry desk. There's a desk closest to their back kitchen that has a bunch of notes, poetry, letters, and sketches hidden in the drawer. It's so cool seeing what other people have left behind. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time the other day after reading so many great Yelp reviews it has. We are frequent coffee shop visitors and are always trying to find the best ones, and have absolutely found some of the best ones and while Cafe Kopi is good, it's not one of the best in my opinion.   My main complaint is that the coffee is served in glasses. My issue with this is that the glass is really hot. There is no handle to protect your hand from getting burnt while sipping on coffee. Additionally, my favorite part about lattes and cappuccinos are the pretty, delicious steamed/foamed milk at the top. Because it's in a glass, the foam goes away faster and there is also much less of it than there would be in a typical wide mug that cappuccinos should be served in.   The good part about Kopi is that the atmosphere is very nice! It's quiet and relaxing, a great place to get work done or catch up with a friend. The coffee also tastes good, I just am not a fan of how it is served."}
{"text":"This is CU's top-notch coffee shop. They have delicious hot and cold drinks and wonderfully fresh pastries. If you want to get some hardcore studying done, this place has good study seatings(outlets galore!) and a diverse enough menu to provide sustenance. Though I am an undergrad myself, the distance from campus means there aren't too many of my kind here...and it's probably better that way."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite coffee shop in Champaign. It's quiet (aka great place to study), fantastic drinks, and the baristas are very friendly. Favorite drinks are chai latte and green tea latte."}
{"text":"Cute coffee joint with sandwiches and other eats - gluten-free bread available! Vegan/vegetarian options.  Standard black coffee - no complaints.  The soy chai latte was a bit weak on flavor, but not terrible. And are we leaving tea bags in this drink nowadays? Cuz my to-go cup had the tea bag at the bottom. It's all good, I just didn't expect it.  Great place to stop in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"Great coffee and food, nice place to sit and work in a college town. Can get busy sometimes, especially during UIUC midterms and finals!"}
{"text":"I admit the coffee here is stellar. However, the ambience is all wrong. Its super dim and crowded ambiance rubbed me a little the wrong way. It's a good place to have a chat with a friend, but definitely the wrong place to go and study. However, every single table was taken by some student!? Geez. Your eyes will go bad if you try to read in that light!"}
{"text":"This is my home away from home. I probably would have been ashamed to say this in the past, but I'm a regular, and I'm damn proud of it. This place is wonderful, granted you can find a place to sit. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dozen tables, but it gets busy, and it gets busy often. I always get the coffee of the day; today it's a creme brulee. Sometimes it's a chocolaty blend from Nicaragua or something strong from Peru. I'm probably making this up. There's Wi-Fi, obviously. There's a decent food selection, too. I love their pita and hummus. They also have Everything bagels, which I like lightly toasted and plain. I get weird looks when I tell them to hold the butter and cream cheese. Anyway, what really makes this place great is the staff. Hands down--the friendliest bunch of baristas in town. I have no shame in spending every waking hour in this coffee shop. I get all my work done, and I see friendly faces. I feel like one of them. Lol. Okay, I'll stop now. Try the latte or the tea. Great selection of herbal teas--my goodness. Excellent stuff."}
{"text":"I've recently been experiencing very hit or miss service. When done right, they make a very good chai latte, chai bomb, and cafe miel."}
{"text":"This espresso is divine. Not burnt like some places. It's just delightful, and the employees are wonderful here"}
{"text":"Okay I'm going to go on the record saying that I love LOVE Cafe Kopi. I know I had that beef about the mocha Kirfa and all that jazz, but I did say I'd try something different- and I did. The Cafe Miel is out of this world delicious and even better than some mainstream lattés ;) Yes the cafe Miel has vanilla, honey, espresso and milk. What makes this beverage pop is the honey. Honey has always had a pronounced flavor, and in this latté it is no different, the only difference is that they don't use too much, so it balances the nutty rich complexity that are the espresso shots with subtle vanilla + honey. No overkill here, but just the right recipe for a latté. I've also had many of their green teas Genmaicha, and Dragonwell are my favorites and the white tea White Peony was pretty tasty too. Their great for staying and savoring your beverage or for on the go. Either way, pretty great coffee and teas; my go to when I'm on the go!"}
{"text":"Cafe Kopi is hands down my favorite coffee shop in the CU area. I cannot even count the number of times I have journeyed to Kopi.   My favorite thing to order in the winter is the Gingerbread Chai Latte. It has the perfect combination of cinnamon, coffee, and gingerbread notes. In the summer I have iced tea. They only have two types of tea prepared (black and green), so if you want a tea from the wall, they have to brew it and pour it on ice. They have a pretty decent sandwich selection, so it's hard for me to choose which one i want. If you go there often, consider buying a Kopi cup. You get discounts if you bring it in!  The atmosphere is what really gets me. The wooden tables look rugged, but they are so smooth! There is local artwork on the walls that gives a \"hometown\" atmosphere. There is about 6 or 7 tables outside that you can sit at. I usually don't sit there because they are either taken or someone is smoking outside.   If you don't have time to have a drink, peak your head inside Cafe Kopi!"}
{"text":"Cafe Kopi is one of my favorite places in Champaign-Urbana and one of my most favorite coffee shops in the whole world. More than anything else, I love the character of the coffee shop with art exhibitions, with such a diverse set of customers, and such a warm environment. The coffee is good, the tea selection is very nice. The quality of the food is very good. Unfortunately, the internet connection is not good and if you are a UIUC affiliated personnel and you want to connect to UIUC network using your VPN, it does not work there.    Overall, I love cafe Kopi and hope that it will be alive for ever."}
{"text":"There isn't lots of room to study; most tables are typically being used, but if you do find a spot, it's a great place to work.  Typically quiet, with a noise level just above library-silence, and a nice bright ambiance in the \"green\" room.  The \"yellow\" room is typically just a little bit noisier, but still relatively quiet compared to Espresso Royale.  Music barely audible and of the \"indie\" variety, and there is always free naturally-flavored water!  I love this place, but wish it would be open later than midnight.  I could honestly work here for hours at a time.    Docking 1 star only because it's usually hard to find a good spot.    I guess I should say something about the beverages... I haven't consumed food here, so I will leave that out, though I will say it is available and seems tasty if you want a quick refuel.  Coffee-- I've had a few of the different concoctions and have never been disappointed.  I am particularly in love with their \"miel\" coffee, which is basically honey and milk with coffee.    Tea, however, is the surprise triumph, here.  I don't know what they do to their green tea latte, but it's different and greatly superior to any other I've ordered pretty much anywhere.  The bold green \"earthiness\" is balanced with a sweet shot of vanilla.  This is typical of green tea lattes, but the one at Kopi is particularly \"earthy,\" for the lack of a better descriptor.  I also love the regular teas, plentiful in selection and served with an adorable teapot if you're drinking in-house.    Five stars, minus the lack of seats.   If you find one, you're set."}
{"text":"I used to live in Bloomington, and if I really needed to study, I'd trek all the way to Kopi, because it was the best coffee and atmosphere in that 50-some mile radius. Sometimes it really was the only place that could tether me down to get some work done because it was such a reward!  They make their Chai Tea from scratch, which is amazing, because pretty much any where you order a chai it will come out of a plastic container.  Recently revisited this place and it really hasn't changed a bit - it's still among the best."}
{"text":"I've been going to Kopi for a couple years for coffee (on occasion), but just last Sunday was the first time I got food there.  Their coffee is always good (from the local Columbia Street Roastery, if I remember the name correctly).  They serve it in pint glasses (which I always found a bit odd).  I got a Brie and turkey open-face sandwich, and pasta salad (a dollar extra option) for about $7.50 total, plus my coffee.  The sandwich was good, and the price wasn't terrible for what I got (it also came with fresh fruit).  This is good, easy to prepare food, since they don't have a real big kitchen.  However, I would recommend stopping in one day for a light lunch, since everything I got was good.  Only downside was I waited a little bit for the sandwich, though they were very busy."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this coffee shop on downton Champaign, and by far one of the best lattes I've had, not to mention the superb pita and hummus, BUT the lady with bright red hair and choppy bangs definitely had a couple screws loose. I specifically said I wanted my iced latte was with soy and for dining in, she immediately pulled to-go cups and she repeated my order to the barista without mention of soy so I had to repeat it, she didn't even act remorseful.  It would've been forgivable if it was actually made with soy but later in the day I started feeling very sick, the same feeling I get from drinking dairy... also my cousin ordered hers without whip and she started trying to put whip on it anyways, even though we asked her three times"}
{"text":"The tea and coffee are outstanding and the baked goods are nice. The service and atmosphere are very pleasant as well. The only drawback is a shortage of nearby parking."}
{"text":"Met a colleague here for a meeting, and it was the perfect spot. Free wifi with no password required. They also had plenty of seating. My only knock is that while I enjoyed the cold-pressed iced coffee, the $3 price tag was a little much. That's me being very picky, though. Overall, the perfect place to hang out if you're studying or setting up a casual meeting with a coworker."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of tea.  Great coffee, espresso, and lattes.  Pretty decent selection of baked goods as well as made-to-order sandwiches and salads. Probably my favorite coffee shop in Champaign with a great atmosphere and overall friendly staff."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good espresso while driving through, found it here.  Also a great selection of snacks and light meals.  Would go again when in the area."}
{"text":"I'm a coffee shop-kind of girl.  It may come from working part-time as a barista over the past 4 years or perhaps more simply because I love the quiet solitude of drinking coffee (or your caffeinated beverage of choice) with others in a space that can serve an office, a spot to relax, or a location to catch up with friends.   It might be silly to say, but I think you get a sense of whether or not you'll like a coffee shop and, in regards to Cafe Kopi, I got that \"I'm going to like it here\" feeling as soon as I walked under the store front awnings and through the glass front door.   The lighting is just right, the music is a suitable volume and of a pleasant variety, and the staff were very friendly.  I ordered the iced Cafe Miel (a single shot latte with honey and vanilla) after reading some other Yelpers' reviews.  After talking with the barsta, she assured me that it was good both hot and cold.  I thoroughly enjoyed it as I read my book on this quiet Sunday morning.  It was definitely a nice option for those that are not Mocha lovers. I can't speak to the food, but I can speak to the ambience.  It was a comfortable spot to read and get some work done and it is a place that I hope to frequent during my brief stay in Champaign.  There was plenty of seating and outlets; Cafe Koki definitely has the potential to be a great study spot not far from the U of I campus. Stop in and see if you get that \"I think I'm going to like it here\" feeling yourself!"}
{"text":"a Aecent coffee house but both the staff and the crowd that hangs here are intellectual sobs."}
{"text":"Good coffee and environment with internet to do work. Love the wood table and chairs."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend hearing good things. It's a great place to come study and get off campus. The drinks are pretty good. I had the mango Italian soda. It's fizzy and sweet. This place is pretty quiet so don't expect to come here and have a full out conversation. The staff is super friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"I've never understood why Kopi gets so many rave reviews. It's not a bad coffee shop by any means, but I don't find it outstanding either. One word comes to mind: overrated. Kopi has two different seating areas, out of which I prefer the one where you place your order; it is fairly inviting, if a tad small, and could benefit from some couches -- that would make it a better place for a nice conversation. The other side, though... boring white walls and boring large wood tables. It's more of a library than a coffee place, although the loud and dull-sounding rock music (those speakers are lousy!) makes it difficult to concentrate. Speaking of coffee and other drinks: they're just ok. I mainly find them diluted, lacking flavor and punch. The espresso drinks can be good one day, too bitter and burnt the next, and watery some other time. The chai tea has a mild clove flavor and nothing else, and I always end up boosting it with other things -- vanilla, honey, cinnamon --. They do have a full variety of brewed coffee, espresso and tea beverages, though. Their selection of snacks is fine, too. (I've never tried their sandwiches.) All in all, Kopi is fine, but there's quite a bit of room for improvement. I would suggest trying out the other coffee shops in downtown Champaign before making Kopi your main stop."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Cafe Miel a couple of times when I was in town. Yummy yummy.  Nice store, baked goods, games and books if you want to hang out."}
{"text":"Very delicious and not too sweet drinks! One the cutest and coolest coffee joints I've ever seen. The baristas are awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped here during a long bus wait to warm up and try their coffee. Loved it! Baristas were friendly enough, the coffee (salted caramel mocha) and donut were great, nice atmosphere, would definitely stop by again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"One of the best cafes in Chambana. I specifically love their teas and lattes. Very interesting urban feel to the place. It's perfect for a quality cup of coffee and a desk to get some work done. Literally, they use old desks from the University. You won't be disappointed with Kopi!"}
{"text":"My favorite cafe in Champaign. Great location. Walkable and busable to many places. Their chai drinks are my favorite. Nice eclectic atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"Relaxed & laid back, this café is a nice place to stop for a drink & study. Pull up a chair to one of the rickety, wood tables, sip a chai latte & read a book, play a board game, or people watch. This place has been around for a long time & always has a comfortable atmosphere. The drinks are good. Food is ok. Free WiFi. Drink & food specials on the chalkboard at the entrance of the café. Can be crowded & loud at times."}
{"text":"This place took me by surprise and I wonder why I had never been here before. The interior is really warm and cozy. They also have outdoor seating and I noticed 'no smoking' signs on the tables outside which is awesome cause personally as much as I like to sit outdoors, many a times people smoking there make me reconsider doing so. They also have free wifi.  I ordered the Caramel Latte and Tuna Salad Pita with tomato soup as a side. The Latte was served in a clear tall coffee mug and wasn't too strong but tasted good. Now as for the Tuna Salad pita- hands down the BEST coffee shop food I've ever had!!! It was fresh, light and tasty. The portion was perfectly filling and didn't leave me feeling like a bloated buffalo after. So this place is definitely one of the gems in Downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"I would've given Cafe Kopi 3 stars if I hadn't been wowed by their Chicken Noodle Soup (homemade taste, a touch creamy and oh-so-heavenly).  But, I think that the place merits future visits based on the fact that they have scotch available for my drinking pleasure.  I didn't like the sneer-y guy taking my order or the poor layout of the place.  But if it were less busy, I think it would be decent."}
{"text":"My new go-to place for study and work! I love the cozy environment with nice music in the store. Tomato and fresh mozzarella sandwich is so good that it fulfill my craving for some good mozzarella."}
{"text":"Cute little place to study and grab one of their specials (which are usually a large size and less than $3). Definitely a better alternative to Starbucks, and their drinks are better too! Study environment is really homy, with doors on the sides of the walls and really quirky tables and light fixtures. Everyone is either grabbing a coffee/lightly socializing or hard at work, so the environment is perfect for either productivity or relaxing.  They have real food here too, so you could definitely spend the entire day here!"}
{"text":"Best chai latte in champaign-urbana area. At least that's what my mom and I think. Great selection of pastries, bagels, and snacks as well as a full lunch menu. Always fantastic service that makes your on the go or dining in experience that much better."}
{"text":"Not really a fan.  If you go for the coffee drinks or even better chai, you'll be ok.  Sammiches are cheap but tiny and, honestly, nothing special.  I did not think much of the decor/atmo/etc; many seemed to like, but was underwhelming to yours truly..."}
{"text":"Cafe Kopi is one of my favorite cafe's in Champaign, due to their awesome location and free wi-fi.  My friends and I will generally meet up there if we're not looking to go to a bar--there are so few other places downtown that have such generous amounts of seating and stay open late (12AM!).  The last time I was there, I stayed from afternoon until later in the evening, and the staff were kind enough to let me hog a table (although it never got overly full).  They have a yummy hummus and the coffee is OK.  I'd advise against the tea (doesn't seem very fresh, so the flavor is a little lacking).  To cap it off, they're credit card friendly!  If you're looking for a place to chill downtown, give them a try!"}
{"text":"While visiting friends in town, we decided to get a pick-me-up in hot liquid form downtown. We ended up at Kopi because it was Dad's Weekend for the University,  and our first choice was packed, with no table space.I totally wish that I could have tried the other shop, because I was pretty much disappointed with this one.   I guess it was doomed from the start, when I was given the wrong drink.  I ordered a Mate Latte, and was called over to pick up my drink, and it was a regular latte. Now, I am normally the person who would say something, but it was cold and drizzly, the place was busy with lots of people trying to get to and around the counter, and I was cranky. Whatever.   I also wasn't too impressed with the Snicker-doodles that we ordered. Not bad, but not great either. The place itself has your basic non-chain cafe vibe, but it's so overcrowded with tables that it's hard to maneuver through. I guess I'd try this place once more, just to be fair."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Cafe Kopi. I was there on a Tuesday afternoon for a couple of hours. Internet speeds were great and the food was fantastic. I ordered a turkey and Swiss from the sandwich menu. They have free cucumber or orange infused water. The art was beautiful and the atmosphere was on point. 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Cute place and great coffee. I ordered a latte with almond milk. Very good! Not many places offer almond, soy, and coconut milk. I appreciate the options since I can't have dairy."}
{"text":"Definitely the best coffee shop in the Champaign-Urbana area. The prices are reasonable, the music (at times) is decent, and the baristas for the most part are friendly. On top of this, they have consistent closing hours at midnight. The reason for four stars is that it can occasionally be a hit or miss on the quality of the prepared drink. Also, the sandwich sizes are tiny given their price."}
{"text":"Update: I came a second time because we've now moved to town, and the drip coffee and space are worth a visit. No, I don't like the espresso drinks, but I still plan on spending plenty of time here, so they earned another star.  We were visiting from the Pacific Northwest and looking for good coffee. We found something better than Dunkin Donuts, but by no means incredible. It's a very cute space, great for getting some work done, and the staff was friendly, so I couldn't give them fewer stars, but my latte was not well made, so I couldn't give them more. I'm sill looking for somewhere that can pull espresso shots and steam milk professionally."}
{"text":"I like coffee. I like vegetarian food. I like good places to hang out and enjoy both of these things. This place has that. Plus sweet sugary treats. Low key. Nice vibe. Be there."}
{"text":"Cafe Kopi offers a good blend of drinks for its customers, a cozy environment, and abundant amount of space for sitting. However, I am on Yelp and not here to describe how this is the perfect place for the sleep-deprived college student.  Latte - Tasteless and very bland; in addition, it was presented in a tumbler. What kind of place would ever serve a latte in a tumbler? It was pretty difficult to consume the rest of my latte after a few sips. For the listed reasons, the latte was given zero stars.  If you are looking for a place to study, then yes... this is probably the right place. If you are connoisseur of coffee, it is best to take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious coffee, awesome food. This is my default stop for coffee or a place to spend the afternoon. It can get a little crowded at times though.  The Thai Tempeh sandwhich is amazing, also try the cold brew coffee sometime."}
{"text":"Great coffee, amusing staff, fun music, delicious sandwiches, great specials, and free wireless.  The internet's been really flaky of late, but the occasionally cheap Cafe Miels and the tuna salad salad make up for it most of the time.  The ambiance is great, and sitting outside people-watching on Walnut is wonderful.  I'm leaving Champaign in a few weeks, and I will genuinely miss Kopi."}
{"text":"All the right stuff here, for my needs today. Fresh made food items and great coffee also. I had the goat cheese sandwich with pesto on side. Really good. Friend had the brie/turkey sandwich and said also very good. Great service here from entire staff. My kind of coffee stop. Thanks folks. Well done."}
{"text":"A great coffee shop - easily a favorite for anyone who likes to go out to work, chat with friends, or just enjoy some fine java.  With a great selection of food and drinks (including alcohol and alcoholic coffee drinks), it's too good to pass up.  I do have to ding them slightly, though, for being a tad on the dark side, plus the seating isn't super-comfy.  But depending on your mood or style, you might well prefer Kopi over the other also-great alternatives on the same block."}
{"text":"Across the street from Esquire, Cafe Kopi has an inviting exterior, beckoning you in to try one of their lovely drinks on these freezing winter days!  Upon entering, I was definitely feeling the relaxing vibe. I could definitely see myself studying here if I went to school here. It was quiet, chill, and CLEAN. Another thing I liked.   Unfortunately, neither barista greeted us, even after eye contact. And there were five of us. I know they saw us. Immediately overwhelmed by the 'Oh-you're-not-a-hipster-like-us?' vibe, which, ironically, did go with the ambiance of the place. It was slightly irking, but I got over it and walked past them to look at the huge chalkboard menu! Ordering was as pleasant as the barista's demeanor, what a surprise. /sarcasm  Opted for the cafe late, which turned out to be delicious! Wasn't too hot, wasn't too cold. Perfect for the weather. We did have trouble find a table on account of how full they were, but after we sat everything was fine. There are stairs in the back, but DO NOT GO UP THESE. There is no seating! It's a trap! Just mosey around the corner to the other half of the cafe and ignore the inviting stairs.  Oh, and make sure to clean up after yourselves when you're done! There are tubs for dishes and glassware here and there for you. No one likes to clean up after someone else's mess!   Key points then; -Good drinks -Snooty baristas -Very full"}
{"text":"why is it that you love a cafe when the coffee they serve doesn't really do it for you?  i think there is so much good going on here that the coffee being too bitter for my personal taste buds, doesn't really matter to me.  coffee is such a subjective thing and i do know tons of people who love it here. here is what I love at kopi: the staff the vibe the cucumber, roasted red pepper, goat cheese sandwich the green salad the grilled cheese with tomatoes the princess cookies the earl grey tea the cucumber water the doorway to circles"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an evening caffeine pick up.  Staff is friendly.  Lot of places to sit and read some of the free local papers.  Large selection of drinks.  I forgot what I ordered but it was good.  Nice evening vibe to sit and relax.  Not sure how it is in the morning but after drinking across the street, it was a nice stop for something hot."}
{"text":"I usually have a pretty good experience here.  They have fairly priced drinks in comparison to other coffee shops, and it's usually pretty quiet.  The old woodwork in the building is peaceful.  Since they opened the new seating, it's not a pain in the ass to find somewhere to sit anymore.  The only real complain that I have is that the food is almost always overpriced.  Although a bagel is just around $1, if you want cream cheese it's $1.10.  Huh?  $1.10 for a condiment?  I also made the mistake of purchasing a granola & yogurt cup for $3.85 because it looked particularly good.  It had minimal fruit, the granola was soggy, and the nuts spoken of on the ingredients list were nearly nowhere to be found.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"They make a good Chai Tea Latte and their Cafe Miel is delicious (a bit sweet though). The sandwiches are decent (had the Turkey and Gruyere."}
{"text":"This coffee shop got me through college. I use to love going here in the summer. lots of outdoor seat. When I first started going there, they served beer and wine. It was amazing. Studying late at night, nothing like a glass of wine to help ease the pain but NO MORE. haha and thats fine. They recently expanded the coffee shop so now they can fit twice as many people as before. They do a great job with their coffee and my favorite latte is the  MIEL. It is a mix of vanilla and honey. Let me tell you... it is perfect. I get it every time I am down in Champaign. I don't think I have ever had another latte like it anywhere else. And I used to work at a coffee shop in Chicago. I even tried to replicate it once but it didn't come out the same. They close at midnight every night [at least they use to] so it is great for some college cramming. Plus their food is organic and delicious."}
{"text":"One of the best cafes in Chambana to study all day. There are plenty of tables and outlets, they play classical music often, and there is a lot of nice greenery.  I really like the lattes and other espresso drinks here. Drip coffee and cold brews are more inconsistent. I definitely prefer the drip coffees or cold brews at other nearby cafes, like Aroma Cafe or Pekara.   They also make an awesome turkey pesto panini ($7, with a side of chips or apple)! Excited to try more of the lunch options here in the future."}
{"text":"Had a delicious light lunch after the Champaign Historical walking tour in April. Tuna melt and soup were delicious. And that was the first real live cream soda that I've ever had. THAT WAS AMAZING! Please try it."}
{"text":"Delicious espresso drinks in an eclectic-ish and worn-in environment.  Coffees served in tall 'pint' glasses. Which really works...harkens me back to Mom making coffee European style in a tall glass with a metal frame with a small handle.  The Cafe \"me-el\" was very good, I did order it very light on the sweet stuff."}
{"text":"One of the longest running coffee shops in downtown Champaign. Good service, but I don't like their coffee that much - tastes weak or something. Lattes are big but get served in a glass cup and lose heat quickly. Also it's usually smoky outside which makes it unpleasant to go in and out."}
{"text":"While I can see the appeal of this large coffeeshop for hours of studying, I had the misfortune of finding a piece of a plastic wrapper in my mocha.  This along with the dozens of flies in the shop (as well as in the food case) convince me that sanitation and cleanliness are not high on Cafe Kopi's priority list. I'd remove this from your list of coffee options when visiting Champaign-Urbana."}
{"text":"Great place to study. It's an indie coffee shop which is a nice change from Starbucks/Panera. Drinks are really good, priced about the same as Starbucks. Daily specials are on the cheap side. Food and pastries are good but a little overpriced. Definitely one of my favorite places in Champaign."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee with a great selection of different blend as well as \"sweet\" coffee beverages. They have a ton of teas, baked goods and seating too. I really like this local and awesome bussiness."}
{"text":"Comfortable coffee house with lots of room to spread out and also chat with friends. Of the downtown establishments, this one is the easiest to find seating in and they get your drink orders out lickety-split. I enjoy the chai lattes here the most. They do have an assortment of pastries but I've never tried them. Recommended."}
{"text":"This review is based on my experience sitting outside.  In the summer, as many others do, I enjoy sitting outside to meet others and have great coffee. Unfortunately, the majority of the tables outside of Cafe Kopi allow smoking, even though many of these tables are less than 15 feet from the door.  I have been sitting here for an hour and a half and I have not been able to enjoy this for more than five minutes, as the stream of smoking is constant.  I would think that in this day and age, cafes would discourage smoking so as not to harm the health of other guests.  This is intolerable, and I won't be back to sit outside.  Coffe is good, but my lungs are worth more."}
{"text":"Great place for coffee and good studying!! Or the other way around? Whichever.   Anyway the coffee is great, I always get the Cafe Caramel in a To-Go cup since it gets cold faster with the indoor mug. The taste is always good, sometimes a little strong, but nothing a little sugar couldn't fix.   The environment varies ... sometimes it's nice, and sometime's it's not; it depends on the crowd.   I had one occasion where some Asian girl was sitting in front of me and kept talking to herself ... which was uhh hella weird. Another instance had some girl in basically tight boxershorts showing off cellulite to the world like there's no tomorrow. And the most unforgettable one was where the place was packed and some smelly ass guy sat next to me. I had to get 2 hours of studying done to prepare for the next day and I couldn't move and this guy just killed my night ...   As far as customer service, it's fair. You order up front, wait a couple of minutes, get your drink and study the night away.  Not the best cafe, but I return here frequently to get studying/work done. I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This is a delightful place to read and work until 11 pm. Nice atmosphere with character. Lots of tables. The cafe miel I had was heavenly. I would definitely make a point of getting it again."}
{"text":"Definitely the best coffee shop in Champaign-Urbana. Great coffee, plus you can get port and some other boozy drinks. The food's tasty, the decor is warm and cozy, and yeah, they have a doorway to Circles next door. OK so the chairs are uncomfortable after a while, that's true. No couches to encourage settling in for the long haul. That's probably good for business though; nobody would ever leave otherwise."}
{"text":"I had some time to kill a couple times in Champaign. I tried this place and also Cafe Aroma. Both were nice but I definitely would go back to Cafe Kopi. It's as good as it gets with regard to coffee houses. Huge seating area so it didn't feel crowded and I didn't feel pressured even during peak hours (although it was a weekday so I can't address possible weekend crowding). The food was really delicious and the coffee was excellent too. The atmosphere was very pleasant and the people seemed good-natured. I definitely enjoyed my hours here and would like to return next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I took a sip of the coffee and DING woke me UP! I couldn't believe that someone came in next and ordered a triple espresso.   Cute place, lots of tables to study, some strange smells out front."}
{"text":"Prices are out of hand at Kopi. $2.40 for a large cup of (plain ol' regular) coffee?! $7.40 for a small vegetarian sandwich, and $2 extra if you want 8oz of soup to accompany? $6.00 for a pint of pasta salad? $4.10 for a cup of yogurt with 5 blueberries and some granola?  As best I can guess, Kopi mgt. is trying to finance their expansion (and possible recession-related dip in sales) by raising prices. They doubled their footprint when they moved into the place next store, but this expansion did not double their sales because the new part is always filled up with students occupying the same tables for hours on Kopi's WiFi, spending hardly any money. Instead of raising their already high prices on the people that contribute most to their bottom line, they should focus on getting more revenue out of the table squatters or expanding their sources of revenue. Bigger kitchen for more diverse menu? Catering? Advertise the booze?"}
{"text":"Ok...I had my first bad Kopi experience today...the Thai Tempeh panini was just...disgusting.  It was gooey, there was way too much peanut sauce, and it was on regular sliced bread (I tend to think of paninis as being made from a more substantial bread like ciabatta or something).  It definitely was not worth the $5 I paid for it, and if I'd paid the full price ($7) I would have complained.  Lesson learned: don't get the Thai Tempeh panini.  I've yet to have a bad drink from here, and it remains a great place to hang out.  Still a great cafe as far as I'm concerned, but evidently not everything on their (food) menu is as tasty as their drinks."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is interviewing at Volition today, and I wanted to spend my time studying, reading & yelping (of course). Kopi was a random choice & it fits my purposes perfectly! It's quiet, large (no problem finding a table), and I am in good company. I'll have no problem spending hours here, without feeling pressured to keep buying coffee. They even have sandwiches for when I'm hungry again!  If we move here, I'll be back to Kopi!"}
{"text":"Located this place on yelp and stopped for lunch. Great atmosphere and character, clearly a place to study on the weekend. We ordered a sandwich and a coffee, which both were great. Recommend the Turkey and Brie open faced sandwich.  This place would definitely get another star if it were easy to find a seat. Every table in the place has 1 person sitting at it with an empty coffee cup and a MacBook Pro- you could make a great commercial about it. There were literally no tables to sit at and no one appears to vacate a table during peak thinking times. Great if you grab a table early, but sucks if you need somewhere to sit and eat your food."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped in this place before taking a bus back to Chicago. They don't serve any of their sandwiches before 9am, which is a bummer. However, they do have bagels, croissants, and muffins. I ordered a red tea latte, which was really delicious! Cafe Kopi is large with many seating areas. They also have free wifi, which is a plus. Overall, a very cozy place to have some coffee, relax, and to get some work done."}
{"text":"Positives:  -They make a mean latte. -The lattes come in pint beer glasses, great reminder you're in a college town. -Best place downtown for (relatively) quiet coffee meetings  -Costs less than Starbucks for way better quality. Isn't it worth it for a local joint?   Negatives: -Because it's downtown, it's often a nightmare to park and never free. -The patrons can often be very judgey hipsters. -The hipsters gather in a large circle near the front door to smoke cigarettes and block the entrance. -I can't tell you the last time my barista had showered when I recently visited.  -Will occasionally be accosted by a homeless peddler in front of the shop.  Bottom line: Great coffee. Great place for meetings. Just don't be afraid of the hipsters."}
{"text":"What exactly is a four star coffee shop? I'd say one that allows meetings of vagrants like me, offers a chill studying atmosphere for those with more industrious aims, and makes pretty decent coffee drinks. I'm not a coffee lover so my understanding of their prices is minimal. I have however met many a date here to make sure I didn't get murdered and ran into a study buddy or two on my way out.   There are two sides with exits, with the left replete with chairs, tables, lights, and a plethora of electrical sockets. For a multi tech person teetering on 15% battery at all time, I appreciate this simple but essential addition."}
{"text":"The cafe is totally worth a visit. Though the drinks itself are nothing to die for, the atmosphere is what makes the place worth the trek. I live locally and often go to Kopi to study for tests. The cafe is warm and inviting, and any studying student will be in great company. Just watch your timing! During finals time, you will be hard pressed to find a seat."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite coffee shop in all of Champaign.  I go there to study, I go there to get a coffee to go, I go there to just get away from home, I go there to hang out with friends, and I go there on dates.  The baristas are always super friendly, nice, and helpful.  The coffee is solid and the food there is perfect for what it is.  The one downside is that the place gets a \"little\" packed around midterms and finals but usually if you wait a little bit a table opens up."}
{"text":"Last Friday I visited with my daughter who lives in Champaign.  After lunch and shopping what's next?  You guessed it, coffee!  I have long been a fan of this cafe, it's cozy and definitely has the college town vibe to it even though it is far away from campus. There's a nice little patio, good food for lunch and great coffee!  It was pretty warm so I had their iced vanilla latte.  I prefer coffee hot, in fact the hotter the better, but in the summer unless I am in frigid ac all day,  I add the ice.  Their coffee stood up nicely to the ice and since I was getting a beverage, what the heck, might as well try some cookies.  I had their iced ginger cookies and they were really good.  I love ginger cookies and these are what I would call ginger lite, delicious but without a zing.  I liked the lumpiness of them and the chewy texture but the ginger was mainstream.  I will be back as I miss my daughter and just coming here would be enough of an excuse for me to head south on 57!"}
{"text":"I really love Cafe Kopi!! I also love their chai latte! IThis place has a very cozy feel to it! In addition to the free wifi, Cafe Kopi is in an excellent locale to study!"}
{"text":"I lived in Champaign-Urbana for nine years.  During that time, I frequented every coffee shop in the area, and even worked at two.  Kopi was my favorite.  In fact, it may be one of my favorite spots in Champaign, coffee-related or otherwise.  The place meets all the basic requirements - good coffee, cozy atmosphere, free wireless.  Toss in a few extras like yummy food and independent ownership, and you've got at least four stars.  The fact that employees' health coverage is fully paid by the company (or was when my friend worked there) easily rounds it up to five.  Supporting a business like this made me not just well-caffeinated, but proud to be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I've been here over a dozen times. For a coffee shop, it's terrible. The only good coffee drink I've had is the Cafe Miel. Also, the baked goods are just terrible. I had a muffin and had to force myself to eat it because I didn't have time to get anything else.   So why am I giving it 3/5 stars? Because the lunch is excellent. And the environment is the best. I come here a lot ti get a pot of tea and lunch and work. I love it for that but I wouldn't recommend it to an outsider. There are much better places in town!"}
{"text":"Kopi is...meh.  Well, that's not entirely fair, it's definitely one of the nicer coffee shops in this area, but there are just so many other better ones (Morning Cup, Aroma) that it kind of pales in comparison.  The coffee is decent, food is okay, and the decor chill but a little too dim for studying (but nice if you just want to hang out).  My biggest two gripes are a) them revoking their free wifi (as of May 2009; perhaps they have restored it since then), but mainly b) running into one of the snootiest baristas I've ever had to deal with (girl with short cropped hair) who barely gives you the time of day.  Maybe she's tired, but I've gotten the same frosty excuse of service from her on multiple occasions.  In any case, Kopi is a nice place and definitely a local favorite (meaning it can get quite crowded), and it's usually my choice of late night study place since it's open later than most other places."}
{"text":"A good coffee experience! The ambience is eclectic and comfortable, with spacious outdoor seating. Staff was friendly and my drink came out quickly. Prices are reasonable - at least compared to Chicago! I didn't order their pour over or brewed coffee, so I can't speak to their quality. But if you're in C-U and are looking for a comfortable place to sip and read, this is the one."}
{"text":"I really like this coffee shop!  I have been here a few times when my band has played in town!  It's a great coffee shop with lots of options on food, and drinks!  The coffee is fantastic, service is great, and it's a great place to kill a few hours working!   Lots of outlets, clean bathrooms, and great service!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Americano! My friend had a latte and it had a super cute design on the top. The interior could be a bit neater, but it kind of gives the cafe a unique look. I'm super picky when I get my espresso drinks cause I don't always trust traditional espresso drinks... but the baristas really know how to pour shots! Will come again."}
{"text":"One of the greatest places for coffee in town. And they open till midnight, with a very quite place to have your work done."}
{"text":"For you vegan's in central Illinois this is a good place to go to!  Try the Baby Greens salad or the Greek salad with no feta cheese.  Some soups are vegan but ask to make sure!  Also, try the Thai Tempe or the Matty Pooh Hummus.  For drinks, get the Chai latte with soy and no honey. AND THEIR CHOCOLATE FOR MOCHAS ARE VEGAN!  Every time I go there I make sure to get a mocha with soy because most places don't offer vegan chocolate!"}
{"text":"When I think about all my years in college or about if I'd ever return to Champaign, I mostly think about the fact that Kopi exists. Ever since leaving Champaign, I've been a patron at dozens of cafes across the continent but have yet to find a cafe as cozy, quality, and varied in selection as Cafe Kopi - yet I've made it my life's mission. You could call anything local but Kopi always seemed to be the center of it all. I was particular to the cafe miels and red lattes, toasted cheese and tomato sandwiches, and turkey-chutney-brie."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but not so nice hot chocolate. I can be a food/drink purist sometimes and I didn't like them using chocolate sauce for my drink. Eww."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a cool space, different wooden chairs/tables and some chill tunes. They have awesome staff members and delicious drinks. I like the americano, or mocha lattes. It's in a great location downtown and very close to the terminal in case you need to come by bus. I've been going here quite often for studying or just to grab some coffee. It was great that they open late (until midnight) on most days."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday morning around 9 a.m. and after waiting for a few minutes was able to find street parking out front (not metered on the weekends).   When I walk into this place, my first thought is that it looks rather average. They have a lot of tables all over the place which must be awesome for people who want to study/work, but the atmosphere is rather boring and doesn't really make you want to stay awhile.   I ordered the pumpkin pie latte and it was below average. Somewhere between drinkable and I might have to throw it away. There also was no whip cream or foam art on it either.  I really want to like this place more than I do, but it just isn't doing it for me. All around an average coffee shop."}
{"text":"sitting insie Cafe Kopi right now. the coffee is REALLY GOOD! the internet is kind of slow though... and hard to connect to at first. also, it took me and my friend over 30 minutes to get a table on a saturday night.. (although it is 2 weeks before finals week)  they offer cheap refills on coffee. the food look pretty good but I haven't tried it yet. their water has orange or cucumbers in it which I LOVE!   a bit loud (+ music) for studying and the seats are not that comfy if you plan on staying here to study but it's a bit of a different crowd than on campus cafes so i guess it's a good change once in a while"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this before but here we go - best lattes in the area by far in my opinion. When I finally branch out from my tried and true favorite, there's a ton of drink options on their menu boards to conquer next. Service can be a little lackluster at times but my drinks have always been made correctly. I usually duck in for my drink and hit the road after so I can't say much for the atmosphere long-term, but I love the warm environment that the cafe has laptop for a change of scenery."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better places to get coffee in downtown Champaign. The Cafe Miel is one of my favorite drinks they serve here as well. Their pastries are pretty tasty as well. As with most coffee shops it can be pricey if you buy the fancy drinks, but a plain drip coffee from here is equally good. It is a popular place which makes finding a seat or parking difficult. Great place to meet for a class or meeting, just be wary of the noise!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Kopi!  My husband and I come here every Saturday and have for years.  The owner and staff could not be friendlier!  They are efficient, courteous and always polite.  I have come here many times for coffee with friends and have never had a problem finding a table; especially since they have expanded.  Sitting outside is one of the best things to do over the summer as the downtown area has become quite the place to be when you just want to sit and people watch or hear local groups playing  on Fridays, during happy hour in the summer.   The only slight negative I would give is the scones.  We used to buy them all the time here as they came from a local bakery.  Not sure where they come from now; but they are just not the same.  That does not deter me from my 5 star rating! A big thank you to Kopi-for making Saturday mornings a time we look forward to!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I used to live basically upstairs and this was my go to spot. The atmosphere is very chill, the coffee is always good, and the food is perfect for a light lunch. No compaints here!"}
{"text":"I love it here. Nice atmosphere, good drinks. I love the Cafe Miel and the mate latte."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and drink selection but horrible service. Cashier did not seem to want to entertain any questions regarding the drinks and seemed to get annoyed very easily. I thought maybe she was just having a bad day but the other barista was also very rude. My friends who ordered drinks after me got theirs before me and I had to look at the opposite side of the counter to find mine just sitting there. I had been waiting next to the counter and they never even told me when my drink was ready  Maybe they were both having a bad day?"}
