{"text":"Elements is a welcome surprise in an area dominated by student-oriented fast food venues. It has a seasonal menu with fresh, often locally sourced ingredients. The prices at lunch are pretty average. Given the high quality and consistency, it's a great deal. You can pay the same or more for mediocre food at many places. The fare at Elements incorporates some local flair, including (at least at times) pierogies, Polish boys, stadium mustard, and West Side Market pasta. Service is good--often by CSU students--and Elements has had the same very able manager since it opened a few years ago. Definitely recommended. If you go during the academic year, make reservations if it's the noon hour."}
{"text":"Sigh... I had high hopes for this place.  Went here for a late lunch.  Upon entry, no one offered to seat us.  I waited 5 minutes before I asked a server if I could just sit somewhere or if someone should seat us. I finally took a seat.  Getting waters and menus proved to be another challenge... Took a long time.  Service is very inattentive.  The food?  Mediocre at best.  I was psyched for the Cobb salad after reading the description.  The ingredients are cut into tiny pieces to make the portion look large.  And they are not good quality... Deli turkey meat, barely any bacon, minced cucumber.  Definitely not a house-made sesame vinaigrette (I subbed it for the creamy garlic dressing).  My friend got the lemon tuna salad and she said it was okay.  The decor is nice and this place has SOOO much potential.  But the service and food need some serious attention."}
{"text":"As an employee of CSU, I'm usually in Elements every other week or so. I don't have a single complaint about this restaurant. Food, service, and prices are all good. The best thing to order is definitely the Ohio City Pasta of the Day. I have never once been disappointed with the creations that the chefs come up with. The regular menu has good choices, too. My standbys are the minestrone soup and stuffed cabbage. My coworker orders the Elements burger every time we go. The food has an upscale feel without the overly upscale prices."}
{"text":"I work and study @ CSU and eat here often. Amazing customer service, great food (most is local and fresh), and perfect prices for a grad student on a budget. Highly recommend the Fleet Ave!pierogies"}
{"text":"I wish they were open for dinner. Other than that, no complaints! The service was perfect, the mushroom bisque was divine and exactly what was needed on a freezing day. I like that they get some of their food from local vendors. The Caesar Salad was amazing too. Crispy croutons , just really perfect."}
{"text":"Family outing to visit cousin near her job at Cleveland State.  One of her colleagues recommended and I found it on Yelp.  The host was very attentive and let us know the progress of our wait for a table, which wasn't long. Erica was our waitstaff.  She was awesome.  She provided great details of daily specials.  Great personality and energetic.  The food was very good.  The table had the pasta of the day, build your own burger and a black bean burger!  Thank you all for excellent service!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise on the CSU campus.  My retired uncle was in the hospitality industry and was coming to see my swim competition at CSU for GG9.  I wanted to take him to a place he would surely enjoy and he was very impressed about the diversity of the menu and the quality of the food and presentation.  Service was very attentive as well.  We did lunch there.  They are hoping to offer dinner in the  future."}
{"text":"I had pretty awesome pierogies with kielbasa here. They were prepared with barbecue sauce and topped with sour cream, peppers, corn and onions. I loved the modernized tex mex flair on old world pierogis!"}
{"text":"You know this place is going to be different and foodie-worthy when the first thing on the lunch menu is 'Seared Watermelon'!

I cannot wait to eat this food again. We had this food delivered to us, so I can't say that I've actually been to the restaurant, but I've definitely had their food. I got the beet salad. You are probably thinking, 'beet salad? That's what you ordered!?'. Yes, beet salad with two different types of beets, truffle mousse, candied pecans, greens and balsamic reduction. SO many of my favorite things in one dish? My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It was like eating a vegetable cake for dessert (see picture). Can't wait to get back here to try another expertly created dish."}
{"text":"My friend and I are regulars here. I always get the Black Bean Burger, and I absolutely adore it. The chips with truffle sauce are also excellent. 

Service is outstanding, and while it can get really busy sometimes, if you get there before noon, you'll usually get a table right away or with a short wait. 

I'd probably eat here everyday, if I could."}
{"text":"Wow. When my co worker suggested this I was a bit hesitant. I'm not a huge \" bistro\" type of person. I guess I had the idea that it would be snooty. I was wrong.  Very welcoming friendly staff greeted us and the menu was diverse and interesting.  I had the black bean burger with chipotle aoli and she the cauliflower steak. Both were presented beautifully and were delicious!!  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how upscale this place is both in terms of menu options and atmosphere for being on a college campus. Steady stream of CSU students walking in to pick up their take out orders from the bar, and professionals having working lunches in the dining room. 

Another huge plus is how affordable it is! I enjoyed the vegetarian minestrone and house salad for under $10. And the fried goat cheese balls that come on top of the salad, OMG, more please! Go ahead and just make it an entire appetizer.

I walked, but my co-luncher parked behind the building and they validate parking."}
{"text":"This is the best food at Cleveland State University. I cannot say enough good things about this place. They always treat me well and cook high quality food for an affordable price. This has turned out to be one of my favorite places to eat in all of Cleveland. My only complaint is they are not open for dinner!"}
{"text":"My co worker told me of this place and its delicious Elements side salad (that comes with fried goat cheese balls) for only $4.50.  It's several blocks from my job so a great walk on a beautiful day.  The place itself is updated, clean and inviting.  I have been here multiple times now mostly to pick up the side salad for lunch.  I once came here on a lunch date with my husband. The sweet potato fries were amazing and our bill was literally under $16.  For a lunch date downtown Cleveland that is super cheap!  Keep in mind that it is affiliated with Cleveland State University so the restaurant hours are limited.  I'm still a huge fan though."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekday. It has a very convenient location and I've heard good things. Overall I was pretty happy. The inside is way bigger than I thought it would be. Our waitress was super nice.

I got the burger with cheddar and onions and fries, medium. The burger came out more well done but it was perfectly good. Could have used some more seasoning.. salt and pepper during cooking but I could easily add those at the table. 

Someone at the table got the fried Mac and cheese sandwich... Thing was crazy big and looked delicious!!

Overall was happy with lunch."}
