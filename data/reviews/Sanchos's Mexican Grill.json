{"text":"We went here to think that they have high reviews rating and wanted to try them. UNFORTUNATELY WE END UP SO DISAPPOINTED.  We ordered chicken burrito, a little bit pricey but we don't mind.  The most disappointing part is POOR/SLOW server, and it taste like they used canned chicken for the burrito we really didn't expect that since we expect fresh chicken to use. I truly REGRET coming to this restaurant.  don't waste your time and money here..."}
{"text":"Good food.  Nice people. Good atmosphere.  Had the enchilada and taco.  Tortillas were yummy.  Prices were very reasonable.  Coming back to try a margarita next time."}
{"text":"So decided to try this place today with my family. We enjoyed our time! I had the veggie enchiladas with chicken taco, salsa was very good not too spicy and ice tea was good too... Everything was tasty! My son had fideo,he loved it!! Love the fact it's non profit !! We had teens serving and waiting on us!! They did great!! It's a cute spot!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was because of the time which was about 7:45 but we were not impressed at all.  I had a shredded beef chimichunga with beans and rice.  He had a shredded beef burrito with rice and beans. The beans were very boring with no seasoning and the rice was very dry and little flavor.  The chimichunga shell was softer and not crunchy even though deep fried.   The beef filling didn't seem to have any seasoning or even salted.  I left over half of my dinner. The beef burrito had the same filling and boring. We both love Mexican food and have tried several in the area.  There were only a few other people there but still took awhile to get our food. What was good was the colorful chips and salsa.  Salsa was good but not spicy at all.  The decor is nice and the presentation of the food was very nice. Sorry would not recommend for good Mexican food and won't be returning.  Was really looking forward to trying this new restaurant too :("}
{"text":"I normally don't leave reviews, but the only other review seemed unnecessarily harsh.   Came for Taco Tuesday with my mom and brother -$10 for all you can eat tacos. The food was good, service was decent, and Taco Tuesday was definitely worth a trip. This isn't a gourmet restaurant, but it's a fair choice for a simple meal. Prices are reasonable, especially the lunch combos (11am-4pm Tuesdays-Friday, I think). My brother actually really loved the carne asada tacos.   Another neat thing - the restaurant operates under a non-profit group and partners with community organizations and schools to raise funds."}
{"text":"I don't care what time it is if it's my first meal of the day I like to have some sort of breakfast meal, so when we arrived to Sancho's Mexican Grill and noticed they only serve brunches on wknds well my waiter noticed my disappointment and asked the cook to make an exception, I got my Chilaquiles and  some fresh coffee I was very happy and satisfied. Thank You SMG! Can't wait to come back for some drinks with my husband."}
{"text":"Great food.  Love there salsa.  Found my new place.  The employees were very nice and attentive. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Just passing by I decided to check out this place, so glad I did! The service, food, drinks, prices & atmosphere is awesome! Comfortable seating for large group & now with this incredible weather outdoor seating is spectacular! Check this place out you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Non profit. Great food. Amazing prices. Super friendly service. Most amazing margarita (made by Ricky!) I've ever had? I love that I can have a drink and support a great cause. Stopped by here after visiting the chocolate factory, and I recommend it highly :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for happy hour and have been coming back regularly ever since. Their mango salsa ribs are amazing- seriously better than some of the bbq places I have been in the area, and they have legit street tacos. They offer all you can eat tacos for $10 bucks every Tuesday as well!  Great food, friendly staff, fair prices.   It is nice to have a tasty sit-down Mexican restaurant back in the Green Valley/Henderson neighborhood. Definitely give them a shot, we would like to see this place stick around."}
{"text":"I tried Sancho's for lunch and was skeptical at first. They are in a location that hasn't faired well in the area due to it's awkward location perhaps but wanted to give them a try since they are the only non profit restaurant that I know of in Henderson. They give %30 to high risk and homeless youth in the community, a thumbs up for that but no so much the food.  I went on Taco Tuesday and chose the a la carte with asada and prons for $12.95.They weren't traditional style tacos more americanized which was fine but they lacked flavor. The prons and asada were the least enjoyable with the prons being overcooked and had  no flavor and the meat was very thick and chewy, not tender at all. I don't think I will be coming back but I certainly wish them the best"}
{"text":"We had a good experience! My toddler loved being able to draw on the paper tablecloth--she definitely had fun with that! Our waiter was very friendly, attentive, and helpful. We ordered ceviche and coctel de camarones, which both were pretty good, along with the chips and salsa they brought out."}
{"text":"This place is a non profit restaurant that has good Mexican food. It's In the neighborhood and reasonably priced.  It's great it go have good Mexican food and help out at the same time. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch thinking it was a fast food joint. It's a very nice and clean sit down Mexican restaurant. Prompt service, excellent chips and salsa. We split the chicken fajitas and they were excellent.  Highly recommend this little restaurant."}
{"text":"They still have some work to do. I want to support them because I love their mission. Right now, their food is only OK and I can't give them a pass on that piece.Their margaritas and salsa however, are both excellent!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected. Not really authentic Mexican food. It's more like Texmex. They don't even season their food well and portions are small for the price. We came because we were curious after seeing it was a non profit restaurant but really wished we would've just kept driving past it. They really messed up some of my favorite Mexican dishes. My husband and I will not come back. If you want mediocre food and few menu options then stop by."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this new restaurant, I was intrigued by the sign that it's a Non profit restaurant. After talking to our waiter, Anthony we found out their mission is to be a fundraising type restaurant to help kids and other non profits.    The food was great!   We had the wings, I would definitely come back here just for the wings!   Then Ceviche and steak and shrimp fajitas. YUM! Everything was delicious! We had a few special requests that they happily accommodated.... no big deal.   We didn't try the deserts because we were stuffed but they have a nice desert menu and a alcohol menu.   The owner chantee is an absolute doll!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this restaurant has closed & a different Mexican restaurant has taken its placeGreat spicy food, prompt service & yummy sangrias! Thank you to are wonderful waiter Jose!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has wonderful service and excellent food! I read reviews before coming here and was hesitant after reading the one negative review, but I am SO happy we decided to come here! The food is so delicious and has great flavor. The staff was very polite and attended to all of our needs. As a nonprofit, places like these probably cannot afford to hire 7-10 people, so a small staff is to be expected. The negative reviewer must not have ever visited a small mom and pop place either.. :-) I really liked it here and will be happy to return!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. This will be my new go to Mexican place. Specially because he is non-profit."}
{"text":"The staff is AMAZING! I was more than welcomed and had the manager make the drink I created...It was on POINT!! Phaderade yessssss!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this to a non profit organization but our lunch was bad. The same man greeted us, brought us our menus, took our order, brought our drinks and food, delivered our check and cleared the table. He did the same for the other 3 tables that were occupied for lunch. Not sure if he is cooking and plating food as well. Luckily it wasn't busy, we were there on our lunch break from work, but we got everything in a timely matter. Soft drinks come in a can. Complimentary chips and salsa. They were the only good things btw! The meal prices seemed high so we went with the lunch specials. We all got the Chicken Flauta special for less than 8$, comes with rice, refried beans, fideo soup and 2 flauta halves. The soup was kind of greasy, noodles were more like chopped up spaghetti, the tomato broth was just gross. Then the meal arrived; all of it was very bland and dry. The flautas didn't seem cooked enough, the inside of the tortilla was gooey and gummy, the small amount of chicken inside looked like a canned chicken hash. It was akin to bad cafeteria food. We all left alot of food on our plates when we left.  We will never return."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place for a few weeks but since my car has been in the shop, it's been hard until I saw that they are on Grub hub  ... I ordered chicken enchiladas with rice and beans and it came with salsa and chips... I tried the salsa first because I judge Mexican restaurants based on the quality of the salsa and their salsa is DEEEEELICIOUS!! Everything was good. Delivery was quick and the food was hot too! I started eating the rice and beans before I took a picture but I am so, so, soooooo pleased. I am definitely coming back here and telling others about this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Almost afraid to post this because it will be too busy to seat me. Food is on point, drinks are awesome, staff is friendly and efficient...what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The food is really good and the prices are reasonable. The thing that really stood out for me was it is a non profit restaurant and they donate to Kids In Transition  (KIT)which is really honorable"}
