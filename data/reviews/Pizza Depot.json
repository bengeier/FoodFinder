{"text":"The worst pizza i ever had. Better off eating at gas station than at this pizza place."}
{"text":"They re pizza is good, well done and cheap. An extra large pepporoni with 2 sauces was 13 bucks. Service was soo slow, and then the guy tried to get me to sign my debt slip. He was also either texting or trying to figure out what an extra 60 cents would make my bill.......im hoping it was the second thing I thought he was doing, because I waited a few mins to do whatever he was doing. I'll go back agin because I do like the food, and hopefully the guy will be more awake next time. It is friday, so I kinda get not being with it."}
{"text":"If you listen to 680 News I'm sure you've heard their ads on the radio talking about 50 flavours of wings and amazing pizza ... this is what brought me in.  Placed a pick up order online and when I arrived to pick up was asked what I ordered even though they had a print out of the order. I repeated my order and was told they didn't have the wing flavour ordered that they only had hot and honey garlic. For somewhere that claims 50 flavours I found it disappointing that only 2 were available and wasn't called before I showed up to let me know this wasn't available. Another item ordered they didn't have and I had to wait for my pizza to be made.  The whole experience was bad and when I got home and opened everything up realized they forgot one thing I ordered. I emailed and called (no one answered) the customer service line and have not heard back yet.  I would not recommend this place to anyone and definitely will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian style pizzas I came across is from this location.  Since they are Indian, they also give away dipping sauce and drinks for free sometimes.  I simply love this. Give a shot to this and you will be happy for sure. Thank you."}
{"text":"I use this place frequently, and am consistently pleased with the service and the quality of the food.  I like that the menu is constantly evolving, new items added, unpopular items replaced.  The delivery service is always on time.  Even though the phone orders are placed at the restaurant, as a walk in customer, I never feel that I am waiting too long for the employee to take a phone order, nor as a phone in customer, I never feel like I'm left hanging on hold for too long while the same employee deals with a customer standing in front of them.  It's very hard to get that balance.  A strictly personal opinion...I am very glad that the restaurant removed the seating.  The place is very close to PHS, and I feel a little intimidated walking into any business where there is a large group of teenagers loitering."}
{"text":"One of the worst pizzas I've ever had. It took them an hour and a half to deliver it and when it came here it was extremely undercooked, reminded me of a delissio that was taken out of the oven 10 minutes too early. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I can only vouch for the Pizza Depot in the Springdale neighborhood of Brampton.   I gave it a 2/5 stars for the absolute lack of customer service. Calling the number on their sign will put you through to the phone / desk near the ovens and back door of the actual pizza joint. No call center here.  And I don't mind, except that the people who answer the phone are extremely rude. They speak in harsh tones as if you are interupting them. They give one word responses when inquiring on specials. If you call them, brace yourself, and prepare to be yelled at or even hung up on. (yes both have happened to me on different occasions).  The pizza: Really good crust. The pepperoni gets nice and crisp on the outer edges. And they dint skimp on the cheese. And if you like extra spice, they will add green chili, garlic, and ginger at no charge. Just ask for it to be spicy. I find it very overwhelming, so I go for mild or none at all.  Other: The wedges are baked, as are the wings and samosas. This is a plus for some, but a negative for me. I'd look elsewhere for my wing fix, as they are pretty generic. Good selection of sauces.   Overall: The pizza is good, but the generic wings and terrible customer service keeps me going to other nearby esablishments."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza!   Had the Tandoori Chicken Pizza which was amazing. Cant wait to try the Butter Chicken pizza. Wherelse can you get samosas as a side with your pizza. DEELISH."}
{"text":"My favourite local pizza place. It has the fluffy dough that I love, making thick slices to bite into and not too greasy.  My usual is a walk in special XL with hot peppers, pineapple, pepperoni (spicy Hawaiian).  Wings could be better, but the pizza is the bomb.  You can order delivery, and tip the driver online. Delivery guys are polite and respectful."}
{"text":"The pizza here was so good the dough was soft and fluffy and not overlooked.  The girl who took the order was patient, courteous, and thorough.  The gentlemen making the pizza was very polite.  Everything was made as requested, service was awesome so glad we have them in our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Based off a great experience I've had with Pizza Depot in Ajax, I've decided to order from the Pizza Depot locally on Ellesmere Road. Sadly,  the outcome was for the worse. The order came at a timely manner and all,  but when it came to the pizza,  it was nowhere as impressive as the one I've had before. It's one thing to skimp on toppings, but to skimp on the basics like sauce and cheese makes the pizza unbearable."}
{"text":"Located in a nice very small busy desi plaza on ceremonial, I have order pizzas before for pick up and its a quick in and out location.  Recently, the management has changed and they have cleanup the store front and you clearly see your pizza in the oven. The front is appealing now.  The recent pizzas were very nicely done with the right amount of toppings plus they give it the desi touch of adding ginger/ garlic / green chillies or coriander.  There are no seatings and its a quick pick up location!   P.S. They do serve halal toppings."}
{"text":"We tried out this location as it's close to my in laws. We were very displeased. The store is understaffed - we waited 10 minutes for them to just greet us at the front. Second, the pizza was horrible - cold, barely any topping, dry, barely any cheese, dough not cooked properly...Very disappointed that we spent $50  at this location. We do not recommend this location and will now drive a little further and pick from another location."}
{"text":"Not recommended! We Ordered pizza first of all the pizza was cold had no flavor and ingredients were missing it was first and last time we ordered something from this place not worth spending money on that"}
{"text":"Pizza tastes good, but very few toppings on each 4 topping pizza. Also delivery was super late. Took 75 minutes to deliver on a Sunday night. However delivery charge is very good (only &1.99). Customer service is polite."}
{"text":"dont even bother wasting your time here"}
{"text":"Delivery took over an hour on a Monday, and 1 pizza arrived hot, 1 pizza cold. Wings were \"soupy\"... Was supposed to be honey garlic with blue cheese, but ended up coming as a watery mess, with them sitting in a puddle of liquid. Their online ordering through Just Eat also doesn't include full menu or wing flavors, so you have to call in anyways. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"They have very good pizza and are not stingy with the toppings either. Their wings are decent. There might be a language barrier at times, but it's worth it for me."}
{"text":"Love this place since I live in the area. Extremely cheap. The fries are so good and crisp and the Thai sauce is just perfect. I like getting the 5pc chicken dippers with fries and Thai sauce. It's fresh and steaming. The pizza is really cheap, too. Good value."}
{"text":"Hell no!  I was in the process of paying for my order.  I watched the person handle the money, then immediately started working on a pizza dough.  Caution: Food safety concern - eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"worst customer service ever, I called in for 2 cheese pizza, they said it would take 20 min, I said we are on our way, we'll be there in 5.  He hung up, and didn't even put the pizza in, and ignored our order., pizza dough is too thick and dry, but kids liked it."}
{"text":"Currently one of my favorite pizza joints. The interior is clean and up to date, they also have the addition of Wings'n'Things. So huge selection of wings/sauces, lasagna, fish and chips, poutine, etc  Staff is friendly, and speaks English. Plus the value is great here. They have a walk in special of two pizzas with 3 toppings each for 16.99 med, 19.99 LG, and 23.99 xl.  I suggest asking for thin crust, extra sauce, well done when ordering your pizza, these options cost you nothing."}
{"text":"Tried ordering here twice.  The first time I tried ordering here, it took thirty plus minutes for them to understand my order that I just hang up. The second time, it took an equally long time to order, but I was craving wings too much so I proceeded, with patience, recounting my order numerous times.  Well, they messed up my order. It was supposed to be fried wings with four sauces and I received baked chicken wings and one barbecue flavour. ?!?!?!? Why couldn't they even get the baked vs fried part right? ughhh. To top it all off, they forgot to bring me my curly fries. Instead of offering to drive the curly fries over, offer a discount and apologize, I had to ask what they will do to remedy the mistake because they offered nothing! As if I'm just supposed to forget that I ordered curly fries. After I asked what they would do for me, they offered free curly fries for my next order. I clarified so does that mean I will get two curly fries on a similar order? They said no just one. Ummmm then that's part of the meal and that is not free curly fries. Until now, I haven't received a discount or free curly fries. I tried ordering there again (walk in) and they have no record of this free curly fries and I had to explain what happened previously and they asked me who I talked to, I, in turn asked, how they keep track of offers they provide when thy mess up orders and so After so much trouble, I just walked away.  And anyway, if they give me *free* curly fries next time I order food there, doesn't that mean they gave me the curly fries I ALREADY PAID FOR, very late and after I was craving it.  Note that you pay for delivery and when they muck up, they don't do anything about it. Three bucks for delivery and I saw an ad on a bus that they deliver for free. Crooks!!! Liars!!!! Can't get an order right! Horrendous service!!!"}
{"text":"What can be said? It's takeout pizza, and it is the best around.  Okay, a little more can be said. Takeout pizza is a multi-dimensional business. There are places that do a thing called pizza which is so experimental and amazing that you want to put it in a shadow box and show it to your guests for years to come. That's fine. That's a way to go.  There are also places that hew so carefully to tradition, to what pizza *ought* to be, that their ovens have been certified by the appropriate Milanese guilds as legit. If anything can lay claim to being \"pizza,\" they are, no doubt, it.  Pizza depot is neither of these. Pizza depot is \"you have friends over, you don't want to cook, you don't actually want to think much about the food at all, you just want it to be easy\" pizza. Recognize that pizza? Yeah, it lacks pretense, and maybe authenticity, but it's often what you want. And on that front, pizza depot is the best. Good crust, not over-doughy, not burnt, actually flavourful. Great sauce, fresh toppings, and despite being a franchise op, the owners of this one are quite keen to find improvements, often experimenting with little touches like olive oil on the crust.  It's what it says on the label, folks, and in literally hundreds of orders, it has never failed us. This is what takeout pizza is supposed to be.  Pro-tip - if you like spicy, ask for their in-house spicy dipping sauce. They have the crappy mass-produced garlic/ranch/whatever dips that everyone has, but they also have their own in-house thing that will light a fire in your face."}
{"text":"Pizza with a twist.... Try the butter chicken or tandoori chicken... Very good. Pizza much better then the pizza pizza or pizza nova in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered one medium pizza with one topping and a chipotle dipping sauce. When I went to pick up the order, they forgot to give me my dipping sauce. I went off with the order and then when i was driving on the road, I realized they forgot to give me the dipping sauce inside the pizza box. I had to take a U Turn and go back to the pizza place. I entered and advised that they forgot to give me my dipping sauce. Then they gave me a pack of dipping sauce and i went off. As i went off with it and was reading the label, it was a creamy garlic dipping sauce. I hate creamy garlic sauce which is why I particularly asked for chipotle dipping sauce so i had to go back again and tell them to switch it for a chipotle sauce. With this experience, I conclude that their customer service is a bit jerky. Pizza, though, was not that bad... i am giving low stars because of the hassle i had to go through for one dipping sauce."}
{"text":"The service and food need upgrading. I'm a paying customer, treat me like one. I came to your place instead of going anywhere else, show me you care. Just a decent HELLO, HOW MAY I HELP YOU would work. If your tired, go home & take your I don't give a shit attitude with you."}
{"text":"Worse phone service no manners,Driver is even worse,I am late 5 to 10 mins in opening door, start bad mouthing with rudeness.Not ordering from pizza depot at this location again"}
{"text":"Tried the Halal tandoori chicken pizza. Was very good. Note you have to request halal chicken."}
{"text":"I ordered large - one chicken tandoori and one butter chicken pizza, non of which really tasted any thing like tandoori/ butter chicken. It seemed like they put only few pieces of chicken in the sauce and put it on the pizza. They charged me double for chicken which hardly was any on the slices(like one or two tiny pieces per slice). I wouldn't recommend this store at all."}
{"text":"When it comes to pizza, you can go to one of the big chains (Pizza Hut, Dominos, Pizza Pizza, Pizzaville, Pizza Nova, etc.), or you can go to one of the lesser-known local establishments. This place is just down the street from me, and even though it has multiple locations, I would consider it one of the smaller, more local places. We have ordered pizza for pickup here multiple times, and have never been disappointed. The Mediterranean vegetarian pizza is the best and we have ordered it several times. Good dipping sauces. Overall, I would rate Pizza Depot to be better than Pizza Pizza (hard crust) or Pizzaville (skimpy toppings), but maybe not as good as Pizza Hut. It's a very good local pizzeria."}
{"text":"Just what Johnathan says. Its not to impress anyone. As far as taste, not crispy, more of a doughy bite."}
{"text":"I order pizza from here most of the time. I don't order as much anymore because the service is not good. The pizza itself always tastes good. There's no oil on top or any crumblings off the bottom. They put enough of cheese but not too much which is great. I wish they had a cheese stuffed crust. A friend of mine ordered potato wedges and they tasted good too.   The service on the other hand, not good. I gave the delivery guy the money and expected change. He said thank you and headed out. When I asked him about the change, for the first time I have heard from a delivery guy he said I should have told them on the phone because he didn't have change. I gave him about $6 extra which was suppose to be my change back. The pizza was good except one time there was literally card board pieces in one slice. We called them of course to inform them. The first guy who answered was just angry so I spoke with the manager who was very nice. She offered a free pizza but we just wanted to tell them because we already ate some of the pizza, the extra pizza would be a waste. We called back and that guy picked up and was still rude and said the pizza would come. We told them to either credit our number for a pizza or don't send one, but he said rudely said the pizza is coming and hung up. We ended up with another pizza and gave it to our neighbours. We took out the cardboard and gave the delivery guy it wrapped in a towel paper to show the manager.   The location is great as well. It's near the hospital and the hospital doesn't have much to eat inside besides vending machines a busy Tim Hortons. Pizza Depot is a short walk from the hospital which is great."}
{"text":"Had a medium cheese pizza and tasted better than pizza pizza. They also offer halal meat which I might try next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Love the topping and crust! Definitely recommended! We ordered the special, and it's a great deal. We also added one topping. The hot Italian sausages was so yummy."}
{"text":"This is my absolute FAVORITE pizza place in Toronto, I discovered it about a year ago and have been a regular customer ever since.  Located in a plaza just off Lawrence rd with a Tim Hortins/Wendy's and many other stores I find this location convenient because it has it's own parking and you can shop in the plaza at the various stores while you wait for your order to be prepared. My only real complaint would be the hrs, most pizza places stay open till 2am where as I believe this place closes at 11:30pm but the quality of food and service more then makes up for it. A warm and friendly smile always greets you when you arrive at this location, it seems like a family run business and they have even been kind enough to stay open later so I could pick up my order which is rare and much appreciated.  This pizza place hands down has the most delicious pizza every time with an option to add some Indian spice to the dough which I find to be a very nice touch that adds a unique flavor and a bit of some extra kick. You can ask for it to be as mild or as spicy as you want and the toppings are always fresh so I have never had a pizza didn't like from here it is always made with the same care and quality.   I enjoy the Caesar salad, given it is made with iceberg lettuce it's always fresh with just the right amount of dressing and crunchy bacon bits. Another thing I ADORE about this place is the wings.... they have sooooo many flavors it's crazy and each sauce has it's own unique flavor. The wings are always meaty and crispy with an option of having them breaded or unbreaded as well which is great for those allergic to Gluten. I always order the honey bbq or the med BBQ because I believe they add either cinnamon or clove in the sauce which gives it a nice warm, sweet heat to it... literally my FAV BBQ sauce now. But truthfully there are way too many flavors to stick to the go to's so I am making it a personal mission to try most if not all of the sauces they have.... given the hot ones scare me a bit but you only live once right!?   I will most certainly update you on my take of all their wide array of wing flavors but you simply must try it for yourself to know just how delicious they really are.... trust me you will not be disappointed.  UPDATE: Hrs have improved I believe they are open till 1am on Fri and Sat.   LOVE this place my Fav Pizza Place"}
{"text":"Great pizza and service! One of the very few places where you can get Desi-Style Pizza ( Ginger, Garlic, Green Chili & Coriander)   The value for money is great and we never have to wait too long for or food."}
{"text":"Its worst pizza depot location. They don't know how to talk to clients. I ordered pizza online and asked my wife to pick up. I paid for my order online, but they asked my wife to pay for it again. She called me and i forwarded her amex paid email receipt. They were rude even after mistake. I will never order from this location."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in town. Sure, it gets busy at times and mistakes happen to orders on occasion, I have had it happen a couple of times and they make it up, but that's because the food is so good that it is always in demand. Love the Flaming Maple Leaf wings!"}
{"text":"Update: Customer service AKA \"the online people\" finally got back to us. They acknowledged their mistake, and said that they would give us samosas with our next order. No thanks! No samosas (that we originally paid for) until we give you more money!? Also, they chalked up the mistake to a computer glitch. No computer glitch can account for the poor customer service.   How they could've handled it better: The lady behind the counter should've called/checked with a supervisor when we told them the order was wrong, instead of blaming the mistake on us. As a token of their mistake, they could've offered something that would entice us to return, instead of making us pay for another order, just to receive the samosas that we originally paid for. Essentially, we got nothing out of it except for a single \"Sorry for your trouble\". Put a timer on this business and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pizza isn't bad. Nothing special although better quality is available in the area.  Interior area could use some upkeep as it was quite messy with magazines scattered throughout.  Washroom on site was gross and clearly hasn't been cleaned in forever."}
{"text":"Good pizza the wings are really good , they offer beaded or plain sauce on the wings or on the side the also offer a variety of different foods always hot, they also have free WI fi and if you sign up on the WI fi they will send you coupon discounts for your next visit"}
{"text":"horrible service! the woman at front accused a kid of stealing when HER debit machine was broken and she did it in front of everyone. Also, they didn't bother heating up my pizza and it was cold and gross. Won't be spending my money on poor customer service and bad food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. I like the pizza overall but the operators are indian and are really only nice to indian people when you go in. Otherwise theres no real smile or customer service."}
{"text":"Have always used delivery b4. 1st time dine in. 2 tables 3 barstools 4 waiting chairs. Nobody here @ 5:30 pm, we got a table. Very broke so used free garlic bread coupon & walk-in discount 3 topping LGE Pizza $8.99. Chose Hot Italian sausage, mushroom & roasted red pepper w/free Chili peppers. LGE EXCELLENT Fries $3.99. 2 cans pop @ $1.10 ea. Total $16.80. And this is a GOOD pizza place with wonderful wings toppings & zucchini sticks. BONUS: Right next door: Tim Horton's/Wendy's so you can get dessert and after dinner coffee or tea nearby too!"}
{"text":"Yet again I ordered a thin crust pepperoni for the 5th time at this join I gotta say they are consistent... price is good probably unbeatable"}
{"text":"Called in an order for delivery, had to speak to 3 different people in order to find someone who could take my order. When I tried to order wings, they had no idea what I was talking about. Finally placed a fairly large order for 48 breaded wings and 2 large pizzas. The order took over 1.5 hours to be delivered. We called the store twice and were told the driver would be at our house \"any minute\".   We ended up paying $68 for our $85 order upon recognizing the fact the food took a very long time, and that they gave us the incorrect dipping sauces.   The driver left and we opened the wings and then realized that they weren't breaded... the menu clearly states that the wings are breaded.   Overall, pizza was mediocre, wings were gross. Service and delivery complete failure.   I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Recently renovated, good choices of pizza. They add the Indian flavours to the pizza which is recommended to up some spice. Have only tried take away will try delivery soon. I like their pizzas and the service."}
{"text":"Came here for a wagjag deal and ordered the family feast. Had to print out the deal so was a bit of a hassle but got what I ordered. Pizza was made perfectly with the right amount of toppings. Usually I don't eat the crust but their crust was good. I would recommend going here for pizza as oppose to pizza pizza. Will come back again even if paid regular price."}
{"text":"This particular location was hands down our best PizzaDepot experience. Very customer friendly and the pizzas were beyond delicious. Generous toppings and great tasting crust. Definitely check them out. We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Not that having pizza for breakfast is my kind of thing but since I had to pull a double today I didn't really have much options. First of all for anyone that loves to have pizza for breakfast, the place opens up at 10:30am but doesn't spit out the first pizza until at least 10:50am because the oven hast to preheat for 20min.  As for the pizza itself I had a classic pepperoni pizza slice, they come on a thin crust so you need both hands to hold the thing otherwise it will just flop on you. It was a bit on the greasy side and you saw the juices flowing on the slice but I guess that is what pizza is all about. But I mean for $3.- including tax you can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good and tasty. Had half toondori and half paneer. The crust was one of the best i ever tasted for indian pizza. Giving 4 stars due they being too cheap. Asked for some red peppers and gave me only one small packed for large pizza. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"The pizza definitely isn't too expensive, but taste isn't as good as you'd expect (Although it is much better than some other places around). The place is packed with high-schoolers a lot of the time, and weirdly they're always out of slices. Theres also, only one person doing everything most of the time, which has Me confused, especially since I've taken home the wrong pizza like three times because of how unorganized the place is."}
