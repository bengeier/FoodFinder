{"text":"Wow - what a treat! My wife and I are here for the first time tonight, and we were both really impressed not only by the food bit also the service. 
Both the owners were working when we stopped in, and it's clear they take pride in their restaurant. We met Chad, the chef, and he spent time with us talking through the finer points of the menu. 
If you have a hankering for a damned good hot dog, this is the place to be. We had the Chicago style red hot (red hots are apparently a type of hot dog and are not spicy red hot), fried zucchini strips, onion rings, and the West Side dog, which is a bacon wrapped sauce and onion ring covered delight. A+ on the food all around.
The ambiance of the place is fun and festive. Yes, it's still got the DNA of the Burger King it once was, but you aren't going to find a comfy pair of papasan chairs and tiki-head tables at your local BK. 
The drive-thru is functional, although it's not really obvious. 
All in all, a damned good hot dog experience. We had been missing the Doghouse on Coventry, but no longer. See you again soon, Cabana!"}
{"text":"I love hot dogs and if you can't get to the Rolls Royce (Happy Dog) dealer in Cleveland then this place is a good alternative. The dogs were well prepared and the toppings were fresh and tasty. The fries were hot from the fryer and well done. I even liked the alternate drinks available. The owner(?) was accommodating and checked to be certain that we enjoyed our meal. We did and the other options on the menu will likely bring us back sooner than later.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Good food! The caribbean wings and westcoast dog are my favorites"}
{"text":"Where to start, The menu features Redhot  Hotdogs, , Wings, sandwiches, and salads, baked deserts.  It is in the old Burger King. Still feels a bit  like a burger king.  The service was very friendly and eager to please. 


 I had to have the Cuban press.  It was a good Cuban sandwich.  The Cuban is one of my favorite in general.  So many places  try to make the Cuban gourmet, too cute if you ask me.  Keep it simple with the Cuban sammie and you can not go wrong.  The sandwich was fresh made to order.  It was 3$ more to add a side and drink.  We also ordered the Chicago Italian beef. It was good, It was a shredded beef sammie served with Au jus!  it was good but I preferred the Cuban.  The kind owner gave us a sample of the black beans and rice.  they were nice,but not what I consider great.

 I am hard to please in  the bean dept as I lived on black beans and rice  when I lived in Mexico, so good. You would just walk down the street  around medio dia, and the aromas  were amazing! Sometimes called the caviar of the Yucatan! It did bring back  memories, almost all of them good! 

So I would describe this as  Chicago meet Miami, meets South  Euclid.  Check it out, a good place for a fesh made sammie!"}
{"text":"They have a great selection of items.  My favorite is the vegetarian dog it is well spiced with all the dressings."}
