{"text":"The Polish sausage and pierogis are amazing!! I really liked the traditional meat and cheese and potato pierogis. The staff was friendly and the dining room was very clean. I will definitey be back!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Ukraine and know how perogi should taste. Was so happy to find this place!!! The dough is so tender and soft, melts in your mouth, my favorite was sweet cheese and meat. Definitely try if you like Ukrainian, Russian, Polish cuisine. I will be back there, for sure."}
{"text":"Best little restaurant in town. Great food and so relaxing! The owners are so personable and friendly!"}
{"text":"My husband wanted to try this restaurant today.  It is inside the indoor swap meet.  The staff here today were very friendly and let us know about all of their food dishes.  The food was very good and we left completely content and bellies full.  Cute little cafe."}
{"text":"Very good food. Eat here. Regret not. Got the mixed plate with the original meat, potato cheese and onion, and the chefs special. We also picked up the grilled Polish sausage. Everything tasted great and prices were good. Can't wait to come back in the fall."}
{"text":"Glad I found this place! Love polish sausage and mustard!!! Feta and spinach pierogis were fantastic! We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Polish Plate which included 6 pierogis and a polish grilled sausage with caramelized onions. we were able to choose different fillings of pierogis, which was great! The lady at the counter was very nice and helpful. We ended up ordering some additional pierogis to go."}
{"text":"Looking for polish food?  Want home style pierogi's?  I had a Pavlov effect desire for tasty pierogi's . Well it didn't meet grandmas or my expectations.   Location was easily assessable, staff was friendly, we waited longer than expected time food was ordered to table.  Food was edible but will wait till grandma makes her next batch for the holidays.  Mrs T's is another option."}
{"text":"Holy Pierogi!! Being Polish from Greenpoint Brooklyn I must say this was a pleasant surprise in the Vegas Valley. Found this via Yelp and I am so happy I did. I haven't had homemade pierogis like this since my grandmother made them over 20 years ago.  My husband and I gorged ourselves on Pierogis and polish sausage. He got the Mixed Plate. It was $14 and he got a generous piece of Polish sausage with a big piece of bread. He chose the sauerkraut and mushroom pierogis and the traditional Polish meat pierogis which the plate comes with 6 so he got 3 of each...oh and the must have caramelized onions. The pierogi filling was excellently seasoned and tasted phenomenal. The dough was a perfect flavor. Homemade all the way.  The sausage is to die for. Polska power!  I got the Mixed Plate $14. It comes with 12 pierogis. I chose the spinach and feta cheese, the sauerkraut and mushroom, and the potato cheese and onion.  The spinach and feta was my favorite. The flavors go so well together. The taste of the dough....wow. It was a match made in heaven.  I had to try the potato cheese and onion because thats what I remember eating growing up and they were so good. Not one of the flavors overpowered the other. The mixture of the filling was perfect.   We left so full and so happy. The service was friendly. I think we were helped by the owner and she was very nice.  This is located on the west side of the indoor swap meet building. It has its own entrance for when the swap meet is closed because they are open seven days a week.   I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I have the mixed plate with 3 different types of Pierogi's. My first time having Polish food and I can't wait to go back. Family run by two lovely Polish women who make you feel your in their homes."}
{"text":"Fantastic, filling, & authentic food! So good. Excellent to try if you have never had Eastern European food."}
{"text":"Fantastic Polish food. I had the sauerkraut and mushroom (kapusta z grzybami) pierogi with a bowl of fresh house made tomato soup (zupa pomidorowa). The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The food was very tasty and reminded me of the time I lived in Poland for a few years. If you are ever in the area and like polish food I would recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"We had a great experience.  We ordered the potato, cheese, and onion pierogies, and they were very delicious.  The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here with my polish grandma today for the first time, what a little gem this place is!  We shared 12 pierogies, and a box of kruschiki, and I had a polish beer. Everything was fantastic!! We cleaned our plates, and I will definately be coming back. The polish decor inside is such a sweet touch!!!"}
{"text":"The best authentic Polish food !Must try! Girls are very nice and caring and  the decor truly represents Poland"}
{"text":"We loved it! I've been craving pierogis since I was pregnant... even tried making them myself, although mine weren't as good as I remembered. We stumbled across this place today right after we had breakfast, but it smelled so good we ate anyway. We had the potato, onion, and cheese, the meat, and a jalapeño special. Everything was so good and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love you Pierogi Cafe! I've been waiting for you for over 10 years & you made this Polish girl so very happy!  Homemade pierogi (just like my moms & grandmas). Ask a real Polak if these are authentic and I'll gladly say ~ heck yes!   We haven't had a Polish restaurant in years and this is pretty exciting for me. Pierogi (Polish dumplings) are one of the most popular dishes in Poland and this place does them very well. They are big & hearty. Full of flavor. You can choose from several different filling options like meat, potato & cheese and cabbage with mushrooms. Try them sautéed and throw on some caramelized onions & bacon and just enjoy. I also recommend some sour cream because that brings all the flavors together.   This place also offers a lot of other traditional Polish dishes like ~ stuffed cabbage, pork cutlet, soups, sandwiches & European pastries. It's super cute inside with Polish decor and everyone who works here is Polish! I really enjoyed speaking to them & the service is on point.   The entry door is located right outside of the Fantastic Indoor Swapmeet and if the door is ever locked during business hours you'll need to use the main entrance. Something about the owners being weird."}
{"text":"Feal like your back home at your favorite Aunt's kitchen table, having all your favorite foods. That is the feeling you get when your at the Pierogi Cafe ! The place is fun, and folksy, they got all your Polish favorite dishes, like potato, meat, or mushroom perigees, and even some non-traditional like jalapeño. The Polish Sausage game is on point, well cooked, scored, and served with sautéed onions. Also the soups are awesome, full off meat, and veggies. I had the mashed potatoes, with breaded pork, sooooo yummy"}
{"text":"My bf and i LOVE pierogies (pierogis?)! We found this place on yelp and knew INMEDIATELY that we had to come... we come from southern cali and we havent found a pierogi place (besides the frozen aisles in the market) . Anyhoo... the pierogies here are so yummilicious! You have to get the mixed plate and try different flavors. We also had the grilled polish sausage with sauerkraut.. oh god our tastebuds and tummies are sooo happy. Plus the woman, who i assume is the owner, was so nice . We plan on going again tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Great home made style Polish cuisine. The best dishes seem to be offered as day's specials so make sure you ask.  I had an amazing red beet soup (borsch) and breaded pork chop with mashed potatoes, cucumbers and sour cream."}
{"text":"I was a bit surprised to find perogis at the fantastik indoor swap meet.    I had some potato and cheese, meat and onion, and feta and spinach.  Third was not my favorite, but not bad either.  The other two I tried were better than most from scratch I  have had.    I will be back to try the sausages next time."}
{"text":"the food is delightful, and the hospitality is a 10.  The welcoming is warm and the ladies are very courteous. They helped my friend and I decided what we wanted since it was our first time eating at a polish restaurant. They gave us valuable insight on their menu and offered us water. I cannot wait to bring my family so they can see the greatness this restaurant offers. I'm happy we decided to stop by and take a look. I recommend this place if you're hungry and want a A large sandwich which can be a pizza sandwich or veggie sandwich. Try their dumplings! And homemade soups!  It's a must"}
{"text":"Pierogi are a perfect food: handheld, comforting, available in a variety of flavors. Unfortunately they're not particularly good for you and difficult to find, even in this city of a million restaurants. Enter Pierogi Cafe, filling the void for Polish-food-loving citizens!  The namesake pierogis are large and stuffed with filling, with several options to choose from. Grab the mix and match plate on your first visit to try a few. The spinach and feta is my favorite, and the chef's special with white sausage was also good, but the traditional was a little dry and lackluster- which is in line with homemade versions I've had. Props for authenticity.  The wrappers were thick and doughy, in a way that my Russian-born BF did not care for and compared unfavorably to a potsticker. I still enjoyed the flavors, so given the proximity to our house, I'll probably be eating them again.  If, God forbid, you are some sort of heathen who does not like pierogi, they have other options- the Polish sandwich is an epic indulgence. Picture a small loaf of bread split in half, then served open-faced with seasoned sauteed mushrooms, onions, and a mountain of cheese. If you can stomach all the dairy, it's enough food for two, and under $10.  Location is cute and modern despite the flea market-adjacent location. Staff are super sweet, and the food quite frankly is better than it needs to be. Here's hoping they do well enough to move to a stand-alone location sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"My sister and I found this restaurant...It took a couple of tries...it is inside the Swap Meet.  It was definitely worth it!!!   The dishes that we tried were like \"mama used to make;\" they were excellent.  They were cooked to order and the ladies who own the cafe were friendly.  Definitely try the pierogis and I also recommend the cabbage rolls.  I'll be back on my next visit to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We love everything here. They decorate the restaurant with all traditional polish stuff. Place is clean. People there is so nice.   If you want to try homemade pierogi, try this place. Price is not bad."}
{"text":"I have to give it 5 stars the food is great and every thing I try since they been open has really been great .polish food at its finest."}
{"text":"Wow !!  We love this place!! You need to check it out !! And they give us free refill in our tea. Love the Pierogi and Sausage ! We didn't have more space for dessert but they bake all the bread here. Amazing finding !!!!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I make traditional Pierogies in New York City. Obviously during our vacation in Las Vegas, NV we were homesick for traditional Polish food. This place is by far the best homemade Polish cooking around! You can't beat anything like it (especially compared to New York City prices)! Should be #1 Pierogi Place in LAS VEGAS!   The whole cafe atmosphere is all dressed up in traditional Polish decor! My mom even saw a few things we have back at home which made her feel barely homesick anymore.   We ordered our favorites, homemade soup \"Borszcz\", beet soup with mixed vegetables, boiled homemade Pierogi potato cheese and onion as a side, \"Kotlet schabowy\",  pork breaded cutlet coated with breadcrumbs, and a to-go bag of \"Zapiekanka\", Polish pizza with mushrooms.  Definitely a great place for anyone craving an appetite for the best Polish food around! Highly recommend and Polish Mom approved!"}
{"text":"Nothing brings me back as a good Polish home cooked style meal does. I'm so glad to have found this place I'm Vegas considering that the Polish community isn't as big out here. Great food. Will be back."}
{"text":"I used to live in Krakow, Poland and this places takes me back to the pierogi I had while living there! Awesome food and amazing service. I live in Henderson and find it worth the drive for the food and service. We loved their zapiekanaki (hot open faced sandwiches) and their polish sausage."}
{"text":"Got to try this place out yesterday and it was so delicious! It's a family tradition that we make pierogi every year around the holidays but this year I was sick and that wasn't happening. Still needed my pierogi fix though, so I found this place on yelp.   I ordered 6 of the potato and cheese and they were so flavorful and delicious. The employees were really nice too and came out and talked with us about our Polish heritage. It got 4 stars because the only option for the pierogi was to have them Boiled and I prefer them fried, plus I would've like to have seen Dill Pickle Soup on the menu.   Overall this place was awesome and absolutely worth the drive from Henderson!  I forgot to mention they also partner with Uber Eats if you don't want to do the drive"}
{"text":"Foreign Food Friday (8/5/16) was held at Pierogi Cafe. A co-worker and I shared the potato pierogis and the spinach-feta pierogis, both delicious! The small order of 6 pierogis is enough to fill you up. I'll definitely be coming back! If you go to the cafe while the swapmeet is open, the exterior cafe door is locked and you must enter through the mall doors and pay a $1 entrance fee."}
{"text":"Love the potato/cheese and mushroom/sauerkraut pierogies fried!!!! Delish!!! My only 2 wishes are that they were able to be made into a combination at the half dozen order level as well (3 & 3) and... Perhaps a little more moderately priced. I think business would be more brisk. Food is definitely made with love!"}
{"text":"Sometimes being the only card in town works to your advantage.  The food is good and as authentic as it can be in the US.  In Europe, the food tastes better because the ingredients are better.  Our mass production has sucked the life out of our food and hence we use \"S\"alt, \"O\"il, and \"S\"ugar for flavor.  And so this Polish food is a good as it gets this side of the Atlantic.    I find the prices a bit high, but she's just getting started so it's not for pocket money, she needs to recoup and grow out of here.  So for a taste of known comfort food's my mother will no longer make (she quit), I'll become a regular and bring friends.    ~Pass it on."}
{"text":"Took my wife to Pierogi Cafe for lunch. We were greeted by the owner Margaret and she gave us a couple of menu suggestions. We ordered the jalapeno and potato and onion pierogies and cabbage rolls and sausage. All of the items were absolutely delicious and freshly made. My grandmother used to make these for us as kids and they were right up there with Grandma's.  I found out that Margaret was from Cleveland like me so we had some pleasant discussion about the old neighborhoods in Cleveland. We will definitely be back and we have already told a few friends and family to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Located at the Fantadtic Indoor Swapmeet. Took the whole Family and the Food was VERY Good! For all you Die Hard East Coasters (especially all from New Jersey) They have AUTHENTIC TAYLOR PORK ROLL EGG & CHEESE on a Hard Roll!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Pierogis! You have to try them..... Yummy!!!!! A little expensive but worth every bite."}
{"text":"This place is very good, I enjoyed all the food. No ice tea when I went so suggest they add that to the drink options. You order at the counter and get your food. They did check on me once so decent to good service.  Food is very good though. I didn't think I liked sauerkraut but learned today I enjoy it a lot. The sauerkraut soup they had sounded scary to me but after a free sample I insta ordered a bowl and 4pc Pierogi. Soup is fresh made daily and changes.   Pierogi (dumplings Polish style) are available fried or boiled and several filling options. I can say the potato onion and meat version are good. Don't forgot to add onion, sour cream, and applesauce for .50c each, I got all 3 but used most the applesauce on my pork chop.   I had plenty food already but the pork chop sounded good. I'm glad I ordered it. Cooked great, thin breading. Sauerkraut on the side was good. Potatoes were okay and needed a little work, the green seasoning helped.   I ordered 4 more Pierogi to give my friends that work here. They gave me a discount since they were going to be for swap meet employees, nice of them.    Overall very good place, I suggest to check them out. I can't wait to come back and try more. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lovely spot, lovely ladies who run it. We decided to do a Polish diner at home and so bought frozen pierogi as well a kielbasa and made them at home. The ladies were very helpful in how to prepare them.Excellent, the pierogi were flavorful and the dough was very light and tender. Makes the ones you buy at the supermarket seem like bricks. We looked at the menu and they have cabbage rolls as well which if they are of the same quality as the pierogi- they must be delicious.  Although we did not eat their the dining was done up in white and blue and felt like a country home. The Pierogi Cafe is in the same building as the Indoor Swap Meet and you do not have to go in there to enter."}
{"text":"Just left this place, they weren't busy at all, I was the only and I think first customer and my Pierogi's were not good at all!! I tried 6 of 3 different kinds and they were all pasty like paste and not enough flavor, the dough was awful. I think she microwaved them  and them put them in hot water .  Sorry lady you will not see me next time!"}
{"text":"With a family member visiting from out of town, we decided to have a polish dinner. A visit to Pierogi Cafe for take home was in order. The cafe also has a few tables for dine in.  The following were ordered. Several types of Pierogi, meat, potato, sauerkraut, jalapeno Stuffed Cabbage Rolls Pork Tenderloin Polish Sausage Mashed Potatoes  Service was friendly and prompt. Each item was cooked perfectly, just like moms. Be sure to order the Pierogi fried in butter, not boiled. Since potato pancakes are not available on Sunday, I made my own to complement the authentic food from Pierogi Cafe. All of this great food was paired with Czech beer, because we could not find polish beer.   Put Pierogi Cafe on your list for great Polish food, dine in or take home."}
{"text":"Pierogi Cafe was a nice small place. It threw me off that it was in the Fantastik Swap Meet building. I've never been to a polish restaurant but the inside seemed pretty authentic. The staff was really nice and welcoming. I had the mixed plate with sausage. I have never had pierogi's before so they let me mix and match different kinds. The pierogis were good but I think I'll get the sausage sandwich next time. It was a little expensive for lunch but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday for lunch and found out that you need to pay to get into the swap meet to even get into the restaurant. So be prepared for $1/person on top of what you plan for food. (The swap meet didn't have anything worthwhile there - this is why I assume a door charge)  The food is delicious  (I'd personally prefer the stuffed cabbage without the dill garnish)! The staff is friendly and we found out you can take home frozen food so you can have it later."}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall in the Fantastic Indoor Swap Meet had amazing pierogi we had the mix plate we tried the potato cheese and onion, the sauerkraut and mushroom, and spinach and feta cheese yummy can't wait to go back and try their Polish sausage and their cabbage"}
{"text":"Unique and awesome atmosphere. There are just enough dolls. Delicious comfort food. Mmmm. Potato and cheese dumplings. This review is currently shorter than most. But it's not just a tip. It's the entire experience & I encourage you to peruse it."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom to have something different for a meal. We have both been to Poland and had polish food, though not often.  It was a little tricky locating the cafe at first, as it is inside a larger building that houses a flea market/bazaar on the weekends.   It is a very cute family-owned restaurant with friendly service. The prices were fair, and the food freshly-made and delicious!"}
{"text":"I looked up on Yelp for Polish restaurant and Pierogi Cafe came up.   First time trying Polish food I think. I don't have extensive experience with it. The restaurant, modestly decorated space is comfortable and inviting,   I walked in and was debating what to get. The owner was very nice and mentioned there are pictures on the wall if I needed to see them.  I am not sure if I've tried a pierogi before, I was assuming they were like dumplings but they're actually very different.  I learned Pierogis are strictly steamed and the owner asked if I wanted it to be fried.  When I ate them, the dough of the pierogis was delicious and very soft! I had the Polish meat Pierogis and Spinach and Feta Cheese. I have to say my favorite was the Polish meat. The meat in it was very moist and saucy, very flavorful."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had Polish food before... I heard this Polish café opened two weeks ago so I decided to try!! I was confused to get to this place. The door was locked to the café from the outside. I called and they told me I had to enter from the swap meat entrance on weekends. $1 to get in.  When I found this place (turn right at isle B), I was welcomed by this nice Polish lady. She recommended me to try their Pierogi. I ordered the Mixed Plate that comes with three different kinds of Pierogi. Pierogi was like Polish version of Gyoza. The skin is much thicker than Gyoza skin but I think the process of making them is the same. I had Traditional Polish Meat Pierogi, Potato Cheese Pierogi and Spinach and Feta Pierogi. They were all delicious but I liked the Polish Meat one the best. They were a little too greasy to me. I think they were fried with a lot of oil. Later I found out they can also boil them. (It says \"Boiled\" on the menu but they probably meant \"Steamed\") She said next time I should try their traditional Polish sandwich. In Poland, they sell this sandwich on all over the street (Like Pretzels in NYC? I'm guessing.)  It was nice that  I got to try Polish food in Vegas. I had a nice Polish food experience today, thanks Kasia :-)"}
{"text":"Very clean and homey place. Inside the Swap Meet. You will have to pay the entrance fee to the Swap Meet on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. But it's only a $1 so not a big deal, and you get to see lots of cool stuff. On other days of the week (when the Swap Meet is closed), you can go directly to the Pierogi Cafe without paying for the entrance to the Swap Meet. (You go through the side door).  Once inside you see the Polish ladies. Sometimes they are not up front so you will have to be patient until they make it out to you. They are attentive once they know you're there.  I really enjoyed the cabbage soup. The kielbasa and mashed potatoes and schnitzel (not sure what the Polish name of it is) were satisfying and tasty.  The pierogis were not quite what we expected, but we are not veteran eaters of them. We will give them another try, and make this place a routine stop."}
{"text":"Traditional handmade Pierogi!? Um, yes please. Margaret was so kind and friendly. Impeccably clean and maintained with love. I will be back for the delicious food and the welcoming company."}
{"text":"So good!!! Cute and quite little place with some great homemade polish dishes.  We had the mixed plate (traditional meat, spinach/feta and mushroom/sauerkraut) and the traditional polish sandwich ."}
{"text":"What an adorable and delicious restaurant! The dumplings were perfect, I definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Fantastically delicious like home cooked food...... you feel like you are part of their family..... very enjoyable.... I even took home frozen stuffed cabbage. And do not judge where they located.... and having  my Red Hat Birthday party there...... just taste their food... Pierogis especially.... Borscht too,."}
{"text":"These pierogis are so good.  I have been here several times and usually get the potato cheese pierogis with sour cream, pan fried is key. I usually just get six.  I have never had the sweet cheese ones, so I decided to get a mixed plate of 12.  I thought it would be too many but....who are we kidding? Imma eat em all.  It's located inside the Indoor Swap meet and you have to pay a dollar to get in but this is definitely worth it even if you don't shop. They have a separate entrance for during the week. They are closed on Mondays.  The service has always been very friendly.  And these sweet cheese ones, I'll have to always get 12 from now on."}
{"text":"Delicious. These are the best pierogi  I've ever tasted. Cozy place and nice staff!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great little cafe serving homemade pierogis. Good tasting sauerkraut and polish sausages. Great portion size and very friendly! I believe Margaret is the owner and she is quite nice. If you're hankering for some Polish comfort food. This is a great place."}
{"text":"Having  eaten at Pierogi Cafe with my son (food was excellent), I went back with my other son, so he could enjoy the pierogis. He got the full order of jalapeno pierogis and loved them.  Margaret , the owner, had told me at my first visit, that they would be including stuffed cabbage rolls, so this time, I was able  to try them with mashed potatoes. I got the ones with rice and pork, so was expecting mostly rice; no, they were mostly pork and delicious. I am so glad that I found this place.  As my son said,  it's like eating a meal at a friend's house; we were made to feel so welcome."}
{"text":"I had read some of the reviews before I went to the Pierogi Cafe but I went stupid when I got there to place my order.  I got 6 potato and cheese but I got them boiled--evidently the default--instead of fried.  I added the caramelized onion for a topping.  Since I also got two of the paczki to take home, the woman who waited on my gave me a cup for some free coffee from the counter near the entrance.  I enjoyed the coffee while I waited for the pierogis.  Mentally, I did a double take when I got the dumplings because of my forgetfulness.  I took a taste of one and it was rather bland.  A little salt helped the situation.  I am also not used to having pierogi made with farmers cheese instead of a more flavorful cheese.  Frying them might have made the cheese taste more, but the potato/cheese pierogi were just OK.  The dough was OK.  I appreciated the thinness of it instead of the clunky thickness of some frozen varieties.  Perhaps they had too high a standard to meet because my mother-in-law used to make the pierogis for the family.  It was her homemade pierogi that I had in mind and to that comparison, these were disappointing.  I think I get pretty much the same quality pierogi buying frozen ones available in a specialty grocery and baking them with onions and butter.  On the other hand, the two paczki were flavorful.  They are only gotten in for a short period of time before Lent--specifically some Polish friends refer to Fat Tuesday as Paczki Day.  I know pierogi are available with a number of fillings but I am more a traditionalist and go for just the potato and cheese although my mother-in-law also made sauerkraut filled pierogi which I tried once and then ignored from then on."}
{"text":"Good location, good parking, and random pierogi quality. I ordered take out for mixed plate, spinach and feta cheese, traditional Polish meat, and potato, cheese and onion pierogies with caramelized onions. But about two of the pierogies had refrigerator smell embedded to it.  I guess they store frozen pierogies with other stuffs in the freezer?"}
{"text":"Yum! Closest thing to my Baba's pierogi in a long time! I got the potato, onion and cheese pierogi, fried with grilled onions. Delicious! A little crisp on the outside, melty and smooth on the inside. My mom and I just gobbled them up. My guy got a sausage sandwich that has a unique and colorful presentation. He is picky about his sandwiches and when I managed to look up from my pierogi, his sandwich was gone. He really enjoyed it! I can't wait to come back again and try some of the other favors!"}
{"text":"I came across this place and decided to check it out since I love pierogis. I got the mixed plate and my favorite is the spinach and cheese. I'm definitely coming back. Mmm"}
{"text":"Sweetest ladies ever and tastes just like grandma use to make. Oh, and Must try the sweet cheese pierogi!"}
{"text":"We love pierogis!  We found out this cafe is the same people that make them at a harvest festival we go to every year.  It's a really nicely decorated cafe.  There is traditional Polish clothes and home decorations.  The ladies at the counter were super nice and welcoming.  We were concerned they were closing in 30 minutes (we hate to be those people) but they invited us in and gladly took our order.  We ordered the cheese and onions pierogis with grilled onions and sour cream and also kielbasa!  The pierogi had a farmer cheese which gave it a sour taste, but that's to be expected it's like a light goat cheese.  The kielbasa was awesome, it was just delicious.  If you want to go to a nice little hole in the wall of a place and you love Polish food you have to come here.  I'm looking forward to trying the other type of pierogis and staff suggestions!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent ... my Polish parents were surprised to find their favorites on the table at Christmas. We enjoyed the perogies which were all gone the next morn"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The ladies give wonderful service and are very welcoming. The decor is authentic and the food is quality. Everything has a significantly homemade taste, especially if you're familiar with polish food and how it should taste. As a native Pittsburgher, to find polish food like this is so comforting and rewarding. I ordered the recommended special which included 3 polish salads/sides (red cabbage, sauerkraut with carrot, and creamy leek) mashed potatoes with dill, and pork schnitzel-type of meat. The pierogis were also ordered, of course, on the mixed plate with polish sausage. Both were AMAZING. The pierogies are very pillowy and tender, with a nice, thin dough casing instead of the usual gummy, thick yuck. Dessert had to be tried as well; opting for the Linzer cookie with raspberry, and the warm, apple cake with raisins. Both were excellent! We will be back."}
{"text":"Finally made it to my friend Margarets's Pierogi Cafe!  It was delicious!  I have never had a homemade pierogi before so I tried the traditional potato and cheese with onions and bacon on top and they did NOT disappoint!  My husband got the sauerkraut and mushroom ones and those were extremely flavorful.  My son got the feta and spinach and I do think those were my favorite!  The restaurant was clean an the staff was so friendly and accommodating.  I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I saw this place a while ago, but finally got to try their yummy pierogis this past weekend. Access from outside as well as inside the swapmeet.  Order at the counter. 6 mixed @ $6.99- choice of fried or boiled- potato & cheese, meat & cheese, and jalapeno (there are other flavors), with a side of sour cream @ $0.50. Pay there. Get your order number. Grab a seat. (It didn't take very long.)   There were just a few other diners, kind of surprising. There were several tables. Good size place- an open floor plan. Clean too. Decor is all things Polish, pretty neat to see, too. I like the traditional costumes. Nice staff.  There were sauces at the counter, like mustard. Also, this is where forks and napkins are located.   The pierogis were delish. Cooked perfectly. I added black pepper and sour cream to mine. We wanted to try it, so we just ordered a small amount. After that, my interest in trying other flavors and items on the menu grew. Some of the pics of the food look interesting, too.  I'm glad we got to try it. If we are in the area, we know where to get our pierogi fix."}
{"text":"I haven't had home made Pierogi's is close to 10yrs. On Friday 5/11/15 I took my wife and son to Pierogi Cafe.  The smell inThis place was awesome. I got 2 dozen to go for mother's day dinnerThe lady that helped me was awesome. She asked how I like them too which I said boiled then fried. She said they best way to cook them because they are frozen is to boil for 4 minutes then pan fry. She was right on with the 4 minutes. When they where done and I bit into one it was like they came out of a grandmas kitchen. The fact that they are made by hand is awesome. You can tell that these people take pride in what they make, serve and sell. I will be back again."}
{"text":"This cafe has delicious food and the ladies in here are very friendly and provide great customer service :)"}
{"text":"Great service, good food/flavor, great selection and prices! Great little spot to eat while you're walking around the swap meet!"}
{"text":"We went there today for lunch. Food is old world style, home made as close to Poland U can get. We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. My husband is Polish  so we always try to find Polish food when visiting other cities and this is well worth the visit."}
{"text":"A Polish friend keeps raving about pierogies and I was forced to eat knishes in my Jewish grandmother's house as a kid so I figured I'd try this place.  I had the Polish plate which was 6 pierogies and a polish sausage.  I picked potato/cheese pierogies and I thought they were a bit bland, but they're probably supposed to be a bit bland.  The sausage was excellent.  Service was a bit scatterbrained, but not bad.  If you're into pierogies go here.  My tastes tend toward Asian foods so I may not be back."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. Good pierogi's. The sweet cheese pierogi, you either love or hate it. The sauerkraut and mushroom is the best one. I don't even like sauerkraut. The meat one is also good. The strawberry desert pierogi is ok. Blueberry is the way to go."}
{"text":"Another sampling of food in Vegas.. off the strip. This time, Polish Pierogi's! Serious YUM.  Place is located inside an indoor swap meet. Although there is an entrance from the outside. You get in through the main swap meet door, $1.00 entrance.  Pay it up, so worth it.  Once you enter, the Pierogi cafe is on the first isle to your left. At first entrance, the cafe was decorated with polish decor. Very colorful table cloths, place mats, etc. Although the cafe was empty, I'm glad I didn't let that fool me.  Their pierogi's are freaking good!   I ordered a mixed plate and choose; meat, spinach/feta, and sauerkraut/mushroom. Sprinkled on topping (extra .50) was  minced bacon and caramelized onions.  Then my husband saw the chalkboard specials near the counter, and it read Harvest Stew. The very nice co-owner explained what was in it.  My husband was curious and ordered.  No sooner did we get our dishes.  I was happy to see how large they were.  I've had pierogi's before and some are pretty small. These were not!  It's a mouth full so I had to cut them in half/thirds. I loved them all! All were very fresh and a homemade taste.  Not processed and freezer burnt. Unlike the frozen ones I've purchased before, bleh! The spinach and feta had a great combo of earthy spinach to mild tart of the feta. My mom said it was strong, but I loved it.  Her favorite was the sauerkraut/mushroom. My husband of course liked the meat the best, typical guy! Again, I liked them all. I wanted to order more but again, we didn't have a fridge in our hotel room.  But thats okay, my mom did purchase some to bring back to Arizona, and they told her to not put it in the microwave. either pan fry or bake. The Harvest stew was so good, and filling. One bite and had me thinking fall weather, what do you know its the fall.  I love the crunch of the cabbage, the sausage, meat, mushroom and the broth. Everything about it commingled incredibly. If we didnt have lunch plans at a families house, I would of ordered another soup and perhaps another dozen of pierogi's to eat. I cant say it enough... so good. I highly recommend going to check them out."}
{"text":"Delicious Polish Food with Excellent Service The owner Margaret is AWESOME!  My recommendations:  1. Polish Favorite (Combo plate with Polish Sausage & Stuffed Cabbage) 2. Pierogi (6 flavors to choose from. I think the spinach wth feta is the best.)  Compliment the meal with their selection of Polish beer! Plus there is a connection to an indoor Swap Meet if you want to walk off the calories ;)"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time eating here and I always enjoy the polish dog but today my stomach turned and was disgusted to find a small cockroach in my iced tea drink I drank half of it already. I showed it to her and she asked if I wanted a take out - really? I will report this to the health department. This is terrible- YIKES!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very clean and decorated in such a cute, home-like manner. It's very inviting inside. I like that the food is homemade and that they take their time cooking your food. You know it's fresh. I didn't find the pierogis and sausage to be worth five stars. It's also hard to justify $14.00 for a dozen pierogis or 6 pierogis and a sausage. But, if you are looking for authentic Polish food from friendly people, this is the place you want to go."}
{"text":"Fried and Boiled Pierogis - Meat, Potato, Sweet Cheese, Spinach and Feta Prune Paczki Lemon Paczki Chocolate Frosted Custard Paczki Raspberry Paczki  Opened in the Fantastic Indoor Swapmeet towards the end of 2016, the simple concept of Housemade Dumplings and a few Polish standards such as Sausage and Cabbage Rolls anchoring a menu that also features daily Soups and a few outsourced breakfast Pastries, Pierogi Café has been a source of intrigue due to both the concept and its location for months, recent Social Media posts about Paczki for Fat Tuesday finally the impetus for a lunch-time visit.  Owned by a Polish immigrant who moved to Las Vegas due to family health issues several years ago, it was after a long time in the healthcare field that the idea to open her own restaurant came to fruition and after a bit of decision-making the opportunity presented itself in the most unlikely of places, a store with an exterior facing door at the large shopping center on the corner of Oakey and Decatur.  Recently adding proper signage, nothing fancy but enough to do the job, it was just past 11:20a that a knock on the door listing an opening time of 10:00am was unlocked, the odd policy that all patrons must pay a buck and enter through the Swap Meet on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays no doubt a deterrent to some since the counter cannot be seen from the exterior, though it appears many regulars - all of them Polish - have already learned the trick.  Perusing the menu temporarily before placing an order, the ladies behind the counter agreeing to slightly change the Mixed Plate so that four flavors could be tasted instead of three, it was with a 50/50 split of Fried versus Boiled that the order was prepared in a small kitchen behind the scenes, the pop-n'-crackle of cooking oil heard as four Polish Doughnuts that turned out to be imported from California were packed in a Styrofoam Clamshell.  Taking a seat amidst ethnic nick-knacks, two elderly women from Chicago entering and beyond excited at the prospect of fresh Pierogis, it was not long before a plate of Dumplings was sat down with a small rectangle of Granulated Sugar at the center, instructions to dip the Sweet Cheese pockets into it happily followed after taking a bite to taste one in its natural state, the inhomogenous filling's texture a lot like Ricotta with the light sweetness of Mascarpone.  Not terribly impressed by the Potato version, neither the fried nor boiled versions flavorful at all without adding on some caramelized onions a la carte, the Pork-based meat filling was obviously more flavorful, though likely to be benefitted by a bit of Pepper or spice in the mixture while the Spinach & Feta proved an undeniable favorite that tasted great boiled, but even more textural and rich when fried.  Admittedly a bit disappointed that the Paczki were made elsewhere, the Doughnuts remembered from a Childhood in Northwest Ohio nowhere to be found in Las Vegas otherwise, the quartet served at Pierogi Café through Tuesday are hit n' miss largely as a result of the unbalanced filling process that saw little more than a teaspoon of Raspberry Gel piped into one while the traditional Prune and Custard versions were crisp on the outside, springy with Eggs amidst the crumb and densely filled.  *** 1/2Appreciating the limitations of the space, as well as those intrinsic to a place focusing on one item, Pierogi Café would be well advised to dial in the execution on everything they are doing and then expand slowly while admitting up front that many of their items are made elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delish!   You can go straight into the restaurant to the left of the swap meet entrance. No need to enter the meet! Most people haven't tried this type of food.  I grew up back east and my aunt's mom was off the boat. As a kid I remember getting so excited when I found out we were going to Aunty Joanie's house and she and Babci were making perogies.  I'm not Polish and don't know how to make em but I do know how they SHOULD taste.   Over the yrs I've seen em on some menus, especially expensive places-- but I guess they always feel pressure to add some exotic twist to justify an exorbitant price and my $30 perogies have been disappointing. This place has what I've been looking for!   It's what you want --- authentic, home-style!   It's not a place to be fancy -- I doubt they serve liquor.  But they are the real real. Sadly, I can no longer do a side-by-side comparison with Babci's... but these serve my childhood memories extremely well... Go! Don't you want to know what authentic perogies taste like? You'll LOVE them. Plus we need to support this kind of establishment.  Give corporate chain restaurants a break, they can afford it!"}
{"text":"First we went there by recommendation and we ordered the sampler pierogis. It was a mix of the potato, meat, and sauerkraut. The meat was so flavorful. We ordered sour cream to go along but we didn't use it cause everything was amazing by itself. They were amazing!! Everything tastes homemade and made very well, you can tell they make their food with love and truly enjoy what they do. The owners are absolutely amazing, they are from Poland and are a total joy to talk to. The place is clean and the food was very fresh. I will return and highly highly recommend this place to anyone who loves homemade food and just wants something different. And I heard they will be extending their hours in the evening as well."}
{"text":"I am guessing that with these reviews.. the owners must have friends who work within the indoor swapmeet giving generous reviews. We ordered the kielbasa sub, 9 pierogis which were all potato, onion, and we tried the two piece stuffed cabbage.  Pierogis were super generic and lacked the sautéed onions and butter that is typical. They were most likely frozen and then pan fried.  Stuffed cabbage was definitely frozen as the plate contained water under the thawed looking tomato sauce.  Kielbasa sub was fair but the sauerkraut could have been more flavorful.  The food was very bland and lacked the homemade feel that they show on signs.  Now if I am wrong about any of this being microwaved and it really is homemade.. someone dropped the ball on taste and quality that I grew up on in a polish family."}
{"text":"Tasty sausage, I had the Polish Platter, boiled... I would have them fried if I had them again.  My friend had strawberry pie rigid and they were delicious with fresh strawberries. This was a special and next week they are having golabis (cabbage rolls)."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Very authentic and the only place I know in Vegas that serves pierogi! Recommend calling it in to go because it takes a bit unless you plan on eating out. The owner and staff are very nice."}
{"text":"I have been waiting YEARS for a polish restaurant in Vegas!!! I was shocked when I found out and the experience exceeded my expectations. Potato cheese and onion pierogis were delicious and prepared perfectly! The whole ambiance and energy of the staff made my day and I will definitely be a returning customer, thanks for everything pierogi cafe and keep up the delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"First time going here and was very excited. Service was great and very friendly it's the pierogi itself the reason for the score. We ordered the potato and cheese pierogi with Carmalized onions and fried. The pierogi had a sour taste to it. My daughter would only eat one. It wasn't the dough but the actual filling. Brought home the left overs and my son spit it out as well. I'm assuming they used cottage cheese which is more Russian way then other cheese. Disappointed but will stick to the ones we get at glaziers super market."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Had some kind of polish soup with bread on the side. Affordable and delicious food. Will be back.  Yum yum."}
{"text":"This is a little tucked away restaurant inside the indoor swap meet.  Given it's location, it would be easy to pass by but that would be a huge mistake!  The food is so delicious.  The owner is a delightful woman who took the time to explain all of the different menu items and correct my boyfriend's pronunciation of some popular Polish last names.  We had the mixed combo plate of perogies, and maybe it's because I'm from the desert Southwest, but I thought the jalapeno and cheese was probably my favorite.  We will definitely be back!  For those with a sweet tooth, try the cheesecake -- it's creamy without being overly sweet."}
{"text":"I'm from Buffalo NY. The second largest Polish community in the US. This place is spot on! Tastes just like home. Can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"Best pierogi I've ever had! I ordered the fried meat & caramelized onion pierogi with sour cream, caramelized onion & bacon toppings. I managed to devour 5 1/2 of the 6 that come with the order (for $6.99) and hated leaving that other half uneaten. It's a cozy little place with a very friendly staff. I can't wait to go back again to try a few other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Best dang polish food in the valley. Small friendly clean shop next to the indoor flea market. All your favorite polish food cooked FRESH and to order.  Many kinda of pierogis, the jalapeño and meat filled were my favorites, the pork chop was excellent. Didn't make it to dessert, but that's what second and third trips are for."}
