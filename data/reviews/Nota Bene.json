{"text":"Beautifully modern and discerning, Nota Bene provides the perfect setting for special occasions and casual dining alike. What makes the experience at Nota Bene so incredible is the total lack of pretense in a restaurant that could easily come across as pompous, and still attract a devoted clientele.

You might find yourself dining with a local politician or celebrity, and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary, all in the same place. The price is accessible, the quality of the food impeccable, and the service instant without being overwhelming.

We started the evening with Chef David's lobster tacos and the margarita fiesta specials. The lobster tacos were served in a lettuce shell, with a chipotle cream, veggies and cilantro ($8). They tasted like something you would find in a great coastal city, and not at all heavy. The lobster special is a great way to settle in to a long evening of wonderful food.  The margaritas were phenomenal, served on the rocks with Avion tequila. We tried a couple of the cocktails and loved \"Chef David's\" traditional margarita with smoked sea salt. The blueberry and pine tips margarita sounds like a bit of an odd marriage, but worked so wonderfully together that we ordered another.

For appetizers we started with the Hamachi ceviche, which is a yellowtail Pacific fish, infused with coriander, lime, avocado, and jalapeño ($16). This dish came highly recommended by our server, and was absolutely worth the hype. The jalapeños offered a very spicy take on the dish, tempered by the avocado and lime.

Next we tried the cavatelli pasta, with a truffle-scented mushroom Bolognese ($16). This dish was surprisingly soft and creamy without any cheese in it, and the truffle mushrooms were divine. We also had the crisp duck salad with sumac green papaya slaw and cashews ($15), and although I am self-admittedly duck averse, I am told it was perfectly crispy and flavourful, and ending up being the favourite appetizer of the evening for my companion.

For our mains we ordered two Nota Bene favourites. I went with the wild Digby sea scallops with avocado purée, Thai curry paste, mango, papaya and peanut salad ($28). For such a tropical sounding dish, the scallops actually had a very Canadian East coast feel to them, the avocado puree adding a creamy compliment to the scallops. Nota Bene specializes in preparing excellent seafood, and I would absolutely come back for this dish again.

We also tried the braised beef short rib with corn truffle, pickled red onions, queso añejo and coriander ($29). The short ribs were tender, succulent and combined with the sharp taste of the queso añejo and the acidity of the pickled red onion, they were layered with flavour and flat out delicious.

With dinner, we ordered a glass of Ontario Pinot Noir and an Argentinean Malbec. The wine list at Nota Bene is extensive, with the full spectrum of bottles, ranging from the $70 to several hundred.

For dessert we sampled sticky toffee pudding ($12) and S'More ice cream ($10). Needless to say, the sampling turned into finishing. Both desserts were exploding with flavour, the pudding a great combination of traditional pecan praline and spotted dick ice cream, taken with a strong espresso; this is dessert to die for. The S'More ice cream was a fun take on the campfire favourite, with a chocolate and graham cracker crumble.

Go try Nota Bene, twice.  Once to become familiar with all that this brilliantly conceived restaurant has to offer and then a second time to cement the relationship in your black book of regular haunts. Service, quality and ambience are all top rate, yet you still feel the passion Nota Bene has for creating a wonderful experience and forming personal relationships with its guests.

See you there..."}
{"text":"I ordered the halibut , wild mushrooms and onion rings.  Everything was outstanding, very flavorful and the onion rings are addicting.  They're thin and not overly fried.  The atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is modern.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I read about Nota Bene in the Toronto Life magazine and some reviews on Yelp so we ( my better half and three young children) decided to give it a go on a Friday night. As a precusor, I should let you know that we are new to the city and having spent the better part of our lives in Asia, we are used to eating at 'good' restaurants or so should I say those recommended as being good. Nevertheless, we came to Nota Bene with high expectations.

The ambiance, is good. The wait staff diligent. The food good, but not deserving of an accolade of being the best restaurant in Canada. I am certain that there must be better restaurants because if this is the top then Canada has a very long way to go; internationally speaking.

We started with the ceviche Hamachi - too too salty! I even told the waiter about it and he simply shrugged me off like my comments were not worthy. But honestly folks way too salty. My children and wife devoured the duck salad and they liked it so much they ordered a second. I had the scallops which were very good. My eldest son the brisket burger, my daughter a steak, and my other son a pasta. My wife had the special which was a lobster pasta. Good, but not top notch.

We had a couple of glasses of wine ( at $20 for an 8oz glass highway robbery but hey, it is the best restaurant in Canada, right? - So a right exists for them to charge exorbitantly for mediocre wine)

Would I go back. No. Would I recommend it?  Perhaps........"}
{"text":"Came here for bar menu- 4 to 7 bar snacks and the tapas special (a beer and 3 pre-set tapas) as it near my work place. The server was friendly, warm and genuine.  The night started right.  We ate the peppers, corn, beef slider, calamari, for the tapas plate it came with fried chicken, a cheese tomato crostini and the pork belly slider.  We enjoyed everything- favs: pork belly, calamari, peppers and cheese tomato crostini.  Yes the portions are small but they were filling for two people and at the price of $4 it was reasonable for a fine dining establishment.  We also enjoyed the G&T cocktails- pricey but enjoyable. The environment was not loud and was perfect for two friends catching up."}
{"text":"Went here after work with a colleague to redeem the hype I heard much about...

Wine list.  Over the top...  
we opted for cocktails (way overpriced but like some swanky places in SF, I get it.  Still pricey nonetheless)  Don't order a mojito here.   Stick with a classic martini if you're going to spend that much on a drink, make it worthwhile.

Service - 5 stars, they all were very attentive and detailed but not overbearing.

Appetizers - my tuna tartar was OTH .  Her steak tartare shouldn't have been downgraded to be put on cheap potato chips like that.

Hamachi - pretty good, both bites (2)

Salad- mine: Crisp duck.  What the duck?  Small, disappointing 
Hers - Lobster salad - for $24, it better have been amazing.  She said it was \"pretty good.\"

Dessert - shared calories!

4 drinks, 3 apps, 2 salads,  1 dessert = $128.  with tip ---$160.

hmmm.  2.5 stars to be honest but rounded to 3

If it's a scene you're paying for, I hadn't seen much more than people trying really hard to get noticed. It was mildly entertaining.
But I don't think I'll drop that kind of money for mere entertainment. I'd rather go to the Symphony or the cool dive bar with great local talent right  down the block."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...classy but not stuffy.  You could pretty much take anyone here...business clients, kids, dates.  
The service was great.  They were incredibly friendly and attentive.
The food was fantastic, and not really all that expensive for what you get.  I highly recommend the duck confit."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend out for her birthday and both of us were disappointed. We heard it was one of the best restaurants in Toronto but sounds like who ever comes up with these \"best of\" lists has been living under a rock for the last 5 years. Toronto has so much to offer when it comes to good quality food and its a shame we still have places like Nota Bene. Both service and food were overpriced and we wished we had gone somewhere else.

We started with caviche and octopus. Small pieces of Octopus were covered in fat/oil. It didn't even taste like octopus or had the texture of one.   Caviche consisted of 5 pieces of fish covered in spices. It was way too citric and again I could barely taste the actual fish 

I got pulled pork as my main course. $7 burrito at the corner shop tastes better. My girlfriend ordered a 12oz steak. $50 for a piece of meat That we had to wait for over an hour because they burned it first time. Too much fat and it was medium rear instead of medium well. 

We wanted to leave right after but they insisted to give us a free desert since we had to wait for out entrees so long. Needless to say it was nothing to write home about.

We also had 2 cocktails which were the only 2 items we had no complaints about.
 $200 and 2 hours later we were finally on our way home. 

Big meh"}
{"text":"Jennifer's Stilton Beef Brisket Burger at Nota Bene has a lot of potential. However, overdone is the key theme with this burger. The beef patty is too thick making the overall burger difficult to get your mouth around. Top this off with a slick of too thick blue cheese and the problems keep building. From a flavor perspective the tender beef brisket is packed with flavor and the blue cheese is sharp and goes nicely with the grilled onions. This is a great burger to enjoy, but it's trying too hard to be amongst the elite of Toronto, which all seem to effortlessly slide into the top spots."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for my birthday and it turned out to be an excellent dining experience. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable so no issues with the service here. The dishes were well-cooked with a fine balance of originality and decent portions - it's not a \"trendy\" restaurant so don't expect a whole lot of food on your plate. 
From my experience dining here, I'd personally recommend people to try the Rabbit Soffrito with the side of Onion Rings. The rabbit meat was cooked to perfection as was exceptionally tender which went well with the soft parpadelle pasta. The onion rings on the other hand were not the typical kind. It was sliced very thinly and then fried which made it even crunchier than usual - perfectly seasoned as well. The food at Nota Bene comes with a high price but you definitely leave happy, so overall, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Acclaimed chef David Lee successfully opened Nota Bene  in 2008. Since it's conception it has been as consistent as it is popular. The space is  a large, beautifully designed and well lit restaurant. Located near the theatre district on Queen West and University, making it a popular pre theatre dinner spot, they even have a specific menu cateered to theatre goers. The restaurants boasts a private room, large bar and extenisve winelist. The winelist is definitely on the pricey side but don't fret, their $35 corkage and free corkage after 9 PM might be one of the best deals in fine dining in Toronto. The menu changes slightly as they use a lot of seaosnal and local ingredients. Like most of my favourite restaurants, the menu is well-rounded and you can be naughty or nice and still leave satisfied. My favourite dishes include: hamachi ceviche, onion rings, cavatelli and lobster salad."}
{"text":"As far as Toronto goes, Nota Bene is one of my favorites.

The food is solid, reasonably priced, and the service is excellent.  Throw in the post 9-PM free corkage, and you can have an excellent night for two.  

The fries are outstanding, some of the best anywhere.  

The duck confit salad was also quite delicious;  the steak (from the \"Reserve\" list) was a bit overcooked (solidly medium rather than med-rare), but well seasoned.  

a great place for a special meal in toronto!"}
{"text":"Service 5/5
Food 5/5
Interior 5/5

I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed.  The lobster salad and sea bass are my go-to favourites.  The staff is always friendly and attentive.  It's a very professional restaurant and located in a great part of town.  I took my girlfriend here in the summer, and afterwards we went for a long walk along Queen street.

The only reason I give it 4 stars are the portion sizes could be a bit bigger, but otherwise, the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Nota Bene is a reliable venue for dinner or drinks @ the bar any day of the week."}
{"text":"I've been to Nota Bene several times and it's reliably good. This was my first Summerlicious visit, and their options included some regular menu items, so you know you are getting their usual high quality of food!  The vegetarian Cavatelli mushroom bolognese was so delicious I want to go back and have it again (another main course I tried, Thai Style Perth Country Beef Salad, was a good lighter option). The Nova Scotia Lobster Bisque was rich and flavourful (with a corn cake or something floating on top that was also delicious), and the Salmon Tataki appetizer was also tasty (and sticky toffee pudding was the usual sticky sweet yummy flavour bomb). The room was serene looking and quiet at lunchtime (when it's busy at dinner it can get pretty loud). What prevented the experience from being a really great one for my guests is that service was disappointingly flat for a fine dining restaurant. The waiters seemed completely uninterested in our table (not quite rude, but like they didn't care) and mostly ignored us (ie only refilled water once, didn't ask if we wanted coffee or enjoyed our meal or say anything other than take our orders, even though it was not busy and we did want coffee). It didn't feel welcoming. My tablemates wondered if it was because we were wearing business casual instead of suits, or if they think tips from a Summerlicious table will be lower?  FWIW when I'm getting a restaurant \"deal\" I normally tip as if I had paid full price, since that's only fair to the servers. The Summerlicious menu is a good value and I still like the place, based on the food and because servers were smoothly professional or even friendly at other times, but one of my guests refuses to go again."}
{"text":"I want to specify ahead of time that my review today is for the bar. 

Came here for a couple drinks after work, and was left wondering why I had never been here for drinks before. For starters, they have one of the most customizable Gin and Tonic menus I have ever seen. G&Ts being my go to drink, I was naturally ecstatic to be able to choose from 10+ gins, 3 types of soda, and even your preferred style of ice. Served with a side dish of cucumber slices and  hibiscus petals, it was definitely a gin and tonic that will put all others to a higher benchmark. 

And if you were wondering, all the other cocktails I had that night were pretty alright too. But again. The G&T....Amazing.

A couple beverages here will cost you a pretty penny, so drink responsibly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Nota Bene every year for our anniversary (because we tried to get in for a drink on our first date but they were just closing). The atmosphere is classy without being snotty, the food is amazing, the staff are knowledgeable and friendly. The salumi plate and rabbit pappardelle pasta are definitely worth ordering. Also, if you're celebrating a special occasion, be sure to mention it when you book."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great staff made for a wonderful experience!  The sommelier recommended the perfect bottle of wine to go with my steak and date's lobster pasta, both cooked to perfection.  The hamachi ceviche was so good to start and the duck salad was great.  The apple pie was amazing with little tiny cubes of quality cheese!  Definitely a great dining experience."}
{"text":"NB is, or as close to, as good as it gets for dining in Toronto.

I've been to NB 5 or 6 times in the last two years and the service has always been consistently attentive and the food has never failed to be delicious and perfectly prepared.

Pros:
- Great service
- Tasty food
- Nice ambiance and decor
- Great wine selection
- Great value

Cons:
- The complimentary bread seems like it's from loblaws; perhaps in house baked / artisan would be nicer
- Proximity to the fin dist means that this resto is usually pretty busy

I really have nothing bad to say about NB, it's a great resto with amazing food. I am happy to recommend it to family and friends."}
{"text":"Yet another Toronto \"hot spot\" that failed to deliver. I think the investors spent so much time on the interior design and decor (yes it's a beautiful place) they forgot about what people really want when the go to a restaurant- DELICIOUS food! Nothing great here, and honestly surprised to see so many high ratings... doesn't make sense to me. Five people on our table, five different orders- not a single person was content. Yeah it's decent, but so are a lot of other places... and they are much easier on the wallet. Like I've said before, if you have money to waste donate it to a local charity."}
{"text":"This space is chic, bustling, and great for a nice-looking meal. Thankfully, the food is on par with its surroundings. Given that it is helmed by chef David Lee, it's not surprising - but I am still thankful. Most dishes are strong and while not all dishes are winner, I haven't had a truly bad dish.

If you're a fan of mushrooms, you'll enjoy their cavatelli starter; with a mushroom ragu and laced with truffle oil. I often skip the mains and order this (available as a starter size or dinner size) and another side/starter as my meal.

The waygu burger is something to try if you've got the extra coin, but not something you're absolutely missing out on. 

While I'd usually pass on a chicken sesame salad, the green papaya listed as an ingredient seemed to catch my fancy. Peppered with petals, this mix with mint, coriander, and Thai basil was quite satisfying, both to the eye and to the tongue. The green papaya was the star of this dish - it was crisp with a bit of tang and a dash heat. 

Their onion ring side is always tasty, though less-good if you let it get too cool

The new side of Shoshito peppers are really fun to eat; they reminded me of the Pimientos de padron that I'd had at a pintxos bar in Seattle.

Desserts are fairly good, but I'm most pleased that they offer salted caramel truffles. They're really lovely and perfect when you're full but still want something sweet to end your night.

Should they ever put the grapefruit sorbet back on though, you should definitely get that. Really perfect taste - not too tart, but with a little bite.

This place is ideal for a nice and trendy (but not romantic) night out. Unless you're going late, the room is busy and loud and buzzing with life."}
{"text":"Not very often you run into places like Nota bene.Nota bene is a great place for any occasions or just a Luxurious night out.Their food is fresh and the flavors are complex.Sticky toffee pudding is also a must have, super sweet and delicious!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Small portions.  Spotted dick ice cream is awesome.  Fries average.  Steak good but I have had better.  It is overpriced."}
{"text":"I went this place for my husband B.D.
Food was excellent! Our favorite is Hamachi, Tuna tartare and Steak tartare.
So fresh and tasty..
Also I asked to them for little B.D cake for my husband after dinner then they bring fantastic cake and ice cream!
Wonderful service and food as well."}
{"text":"Went for summerlecious, the place is nice.
For start I had tuna tartare thing,it was ok.
The steak was good.
To finish off I had something like panna cotta with blue berry type thing I like it.
Overall I was satisfied, I like their serving portions."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed ... My 4th visit there, let's say it's lost some of what it was....service was poor...waiter was in cruise control as soon as we walked in....I'm far from demanding but at the minimum I expect a drink order to be taken within the first 15 minutes of being sat down....I was trying to figure out who our server was because the waiter at the table next to us stood and folded a few napkins and stared blankly at our table .... No way he's ours is he?????  Yep....very odd for a D Lee restaurant .... 

Food was 3.5/5 btw"}
{"text":"Went here on the night before my wedding with my family. 
Had the duck salad to start - it was ok, nothing special 
Then had the burger - again, pretty standard
Didn't have any dessert.
Overall the food itself wasn't great - the Brussels went back for being too spicy and came back very bland. 
The service though was very attentive and knowledgeable  
I wouldn't go back though"}
{"text":"Nota Bene was fantastic! I'd walked by a million times, read a ton about it, and finally decided to give it a try. We called last minute and they were very accommodating in fitting us in. The staff was super, super nice and very helpful, two things I expect at this level of price point. 

Nota Bene did not disappoint in any way!  In fact, when I couldn't decide whether to get one of their special cocktails or a glass of wine, our server brought me a \"taste\", which was really about three good sips, of the cocktail to try before I bought. And delicious, it was. Imagine a Kir Royale, but made with Viognier instead of bubbly and Cherry Marnier instead of Cassis. Yes, please!

For dinner, I had the braised beef short ribs that were served with pickled horseradish salad, cucumber and cornichons. The short ribs were so tender that I was able to cut it with my fork. We ordered pomme frites for the table and they were served with shaved parmeseano reggiano on top. OMG, amazing!  My date had the seared tuna and the small taste of it I had was awesome. 

For dessert, we shared the Niagara Cherry Crumble, and also had three pieces of cheese: Riopelle, Tuxford and Tebbutt, and Beemster.

The prices are good for the quality of food and service. I just may have found my new favourite \"fancy\" restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"food was.fantastic, our waiter sucked, he got mad at us for spliting bill insisted twice if we had anyone as a couple and pay one bill. you can tell in his tone of voice he was.annoyed that he had to do more. If you are going to be high end, act high end. bc you slapped an automatic 20% gratuity on our bill and you think we should pay for it? Shitty waiter...I am giving three star just for the food."}
{"text":"I thankfully discovered this restaurant when I was in Toronto a few months back. It was my first trip to Toronto and I was in town for 5 nights. Of the five nights I dined there three times. Each time I ordered something different and each tip I was completely satisfied with the result. Not to mention the bar staff was very knowledgeable and very attentive. I was dining by myself each time and the bartenders conversed with me whenever they had the chance so it felt like I was at a table with two others. I have nothing negative to say about this restaurant, food or employees.

I am thankfully back in Toronto for 5 days and went there last night. I was not disappointed and I'm sure I'll be there another time or two while here!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth checking out, more than once. It's tough to review a restaurant that has so many reviews though, so let me aim for an \"update\".

With such a close location to the theatre district, this is definitely a nice change from the gaudy restaurants on King St. The decor is American contemporary but welcoming and you definitely feel like the place has class.

The wine and meal menus are both quite nice though priced to keep away kids in their late teens trying to impress on a first date. That's a shame for the rest of us who still want to look sophisticated on a date, but don't fret, since a meal for two should come in well under $200. 

We shared a Mozzarella di Bufala (delish) and I got the 8oz Beef Tenderloin (cooked medium as requested, executed well) while she got the Glazed B.C. Black Cod (which was probably sable fish misrepresented as cod, but apparently quite tasty). A side order of pommes frites, which had shaved parmesan sprinkled on top, completed the meal.

We ordered wine by the glass, but that didn't limit us to the local vinegar. I tried a Sangiovese that had just the right tannins and rich berry flavours to pair well with my steak, while she had a delicate Tuscan white who's varietal I forget. Lesson: don't be afraid of the \"per-glass\" wine choices.

I will visit again sometime in the next year."}
{"text":"So me and my girls headed out to Nota Bene on a Friday Night to check out what's so special about this Restaurant on Queen St West. Had reservations for 8pm and we arrived early and we were promptly seated at our table. \"Bonus Point for them\"

Great restaurant nicely done but really nothing to brag about. The place was busy and very loud. When the rest of our party joined us we placed our food orders and ooh boy were we taken by surprise or what?

Cocktails:
Nota Bene Drink...........Yummy
Lychee Martini..........Incredible
Vodka Martini with Olives...........Divine
Cosmo Martini...........Good Stuff


Begin: 
Dry Cured Ham...................Small Plate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Excuse me what is this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shaved Ham placed on a plate.OMG are you kidding me Just ham I said what about some Olives on the side...Sorry Ma'am our waitress told me it's just the ham on a plate......LOL

Mixed Seafood or Lobster Salad...........Can't recall what it says on the menu............It was So So

Follow:
Scallops.............Cooked to perfection
Venison..............Amazing
Sea Bass.............Awesome
Filet Mignon............Excellent
Frites................Delicious

Dessert:
Apple Crumble with Cream Cheese Yogurt or whatever that white stuff was that was placed in the centre of apple crumble.................Yuk Yuk....Horrid
Toffee Pudding..........Delicious

OK so before I forget the other part that was really weird.......They advertise BRING YOUR OWN WINE & AFTER 9PM THE CORKING FEE IS FREE. The minute we pulled out our 2 Bottles of Wine after 9pm we got a bit of attitude from our wait staff................HELLO, it's clearly advertised on your web site that we can bring our own wine.............

NOTA BENE is not for me or my friends. Moving on to another restaurant & of course there is plenty in Toronto."}
{"text":"Nota Bene was unfortunate not notable. I had high expectations after reading rave reviews from food critics however this restaurant feels Hirt for me for two reasons. First, I found it extremely overpriced for the portions that I got. I am no stranger to fine dining and eating very small portions however at Nota Bene the menu is meant for you to order a full entree and the fish that I ordered was not enough food. Secondly, and most importantly, the flavours of my fish were off. I ordered the glazed BC black cod and came on a bed of a dill & fennel salad and sweet potato, neither of which stood out. The sauce had a peculiar taste which was not to my liking. My 3 other girlfriends went with me had similar comments about their meals - they ordered the halibut and the seafood special for the evening. Neither of us were impressed with the food. However, since none of us were full we all ordered dessert which was definitely delicious. Overall, I would like to try Nota Bene again since I have still heard such great things but will only go back if it's on my someone else's dime."}
{"text":"Wow! I am never disappointed after a meal at Nota Bene. Had not been there in about 3 months.  I won't wait that long again.  As usual, everything was bang on...good service, comfortable dining environment, and great food. One of the best values around for this type of fare (higher end dining). A bottle of wine with 2 friends plus a beer, appetizer, main, dessert and coffee set me back $110 (tip in). For some reason, I ALWAYS get the beef short ribs as my main. I'm sure the other mains are great but the short ribs are cooked to a melt in your mouth perfection.  As for atmosphere, the main dining room is spacious, seating is comfortable and they don't jam in the tables. Keep it up Nota Bene! +ives: food, comfort, price -ives: can be tough to get a table in main dining room so make a reservation ahead of time"}
{"text":"My client recommended this place to me. I took my wife there before going to watch \"The Nutcracker\", and they had a pre set menu.  Service was excellent and food was delightful.  Prices of wine were high,  least expensive bottle was about $55"}
{"text":"Came here for a celebratory lunch today. We were a group of 7 in a very sparsely occupied dining room. I took into account that this was a lunch, not a dinner.

FOOD:
Most ordered the special (pulled beef over pappardelle), another the steak frites, another the lobster salad. Execution of all the dishes was excellent. Pappardelle was near perfect-- good starchiness, about 30 secs from al dente, nice and eggy flavour. The person who ordered steak frites asked for it \"very well done.\" I restrained every pretentious bone in my body (there are several) and did not make any snide remarks. The lobster salad was apparently \"great.\"

Where it all fell apart was the SERVICE.... 

My expectations on service are commensurate to the cost of the meal. Therefore what I might consider wonderful service at one establishment I would consider an insult at another. Nota Bene, while not necessarily the most expensive restaurant in Toronto, definitely falls squarely into my \"high expectations\" category. While the food certainly met those expectations, the service most certainly did not.

Please don't think that there was any rudeness or attitude. However, I would have expected promptness and attentiveness at the very least. Congeniality and pleasantness are bonuses that I do not require.

After we ordered, appetizers took about 20 minutes to come out (soups and salads). After appetizers, there was about a 45 minute wait until our mains came out. This was during a time when the dining room had perhaps 4-5 other tables of 2. The bar was empty. Other tables were seated after us and served before us. Our bread trays were left empty. Well, at least our waters were being routinely refilled--oh wait, that is annoying as heck.

We had to ask twice about the status of our food. First time was an almost brush off, second time we were told that she had checked on our food. No mention of when it would arrive, perhaps she was expecting that our sheer gratitude for her having \"checked on our food\" would distract us from that detail.

When the food finally came out, there was no apology, no explanation. Finally the FOH came by with two orders of fries and she said \"I understand there was a slight delay with your food\"-- I didn't know if I should laugh at the ridiculousness of the gesture or weep at the confirmation of the demise of good service. Seriously, the compensation for an unacceptable delay with no explanation was 2 bowls of fries for 7 people??? I was utterly embarrassed for her.

Am I being a nitpicker? Perhaps. This is obviously a restaurant that does not have or need a strong lunch pull. However, I believe that a restaurant of this caliber should strive for a conscientiousness and accountability no matter what time of day."}
{"text":"Unable to get a reservation, the S.O. and I snagged one of the cramped 2-tops in \"the lounge\" (bar area). I like the chillaxed vibe in the lounge but trying to juggle the bread basket, side plates, and stemware without knocking over one of the precious wineglasses was a bit of a challenge.  As luck would have it, a couple we knew walked in and we decided to join forces at the more spacious table for 4 tucked into the corner of the lounge--the best table in the bar area, IMHO.

I loved, loved, loved my chilled zucchini soup which came garnished with sun-dried tomato pesto, croutons, and a drizzle of grassy e.v.o.o. This light refreshing starter was the perfect tonic on a hot summer's night. Next was a grilled sea bass filet and one plump, sweet scallop on a bed of lentils and spinach. The fish was fine but the scallop was damn near divine. My dining mates all enjoyed their meals (bibb salad, smoked salmon  starter, another zucc soup, 2 orders of short ribs, steak). And if you're a dessert person, don't miss out on their scrumptious bing cherry crumble.

Nota Bene has an extensive wine list with a multitude of options available by the 5-oz carafe which is great if you're a lightweight like me or you've got a split along the red and white divide. 

Our waitress was efficient, if a bit cold, but I think that's better than having servers who want to be your BFF.

The prices are reasonable for this calibre of restaurant ($10-24 starters, $19-$25 mains, 40 bucks and up for steaks) but if you have a show to catch at the Four Seasons, the pre-theater menu is a steal at $27 for two courses or $35 for three courses. You just have to get there before 6:30 on a performance night."}
{"text":"This is a chic restaurant with delicious food. We got a last minute late night reservation and it was perfect. We had the crisp duck salad, the beef tenderloin, and the brisket burger -- all tasty! Like most fine dining restaurants, the portions are on the small side, but that is what we expected. Service was a bit slow but very friendly and polite. They were able to accommodate food allergies, which was a major plus. The ambiance is a little too open air urban chic. If you are looking for intimate, this probably isn't the best choice. But it definitely has an air of fanciness and the food is well worth the price."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday and had a really great experience.

From the street, Nota Bene looks like a super impressive space. But once inside, I was surprised how....boring the decor was. Beige walls and wood. I wanted it to be more modern. But that's me just being a tad picky.

Service was really great and attentive, my water glass was never empty, there seemed to be a waiter around at all times, but not in an annoying way.

Ordered the mediterranean sea bass as a main. It came perfectly cooked, drizzled in high quality olive oil with over a warm salad of cherry tomatoes, slivered fennel, super ripe cubed avocado, and my favourite: panko crusted, deep fried zucchini blossoms. the avocado added a much needed layer of creaminess, the tomatoes a bunch of acid and the zucchini flowers the perfect amount of crispiness and fat. loved everything about this dish.

Sprung for dessert, had the sticky toffee pudding with pecan prailine & spotted dick ice cream. again, perfectly executed. the pudding/cake layer was light a fluffy (not dense like most sticky toffee puddings), the toffee sauce was sweet with a bit of salty and the ice cream was....simply amazing.

A great lunch Would love it check it out for dinner. Maybe I'll sit in the bar area where the decor is much more my taste :)"}
{"text":"My date and I were extremely disappointed with the attitude and service we got our from our server. 

I was asking if they had any mocktails, and the server says \"I don't know, because I pair wine with my food\". If you work at the restaurant, you should know your drink list. Some people don't drink because they could have a low tolerance, or are pregnant. That was extremely snotty and unprofessional. 

When we were done our meal, we wanted to pack up our leftovers, and the server (Who looks like Saul from 'Better Call Saul') said to us \"Some people take the bone (of the cote de boeuf) only to feed their dogs.\" Thank you for your unsolicited advice. 

To top it off, we were never given our leftovers. The server actually gave us an extra tag to check in your stuff, but we weren't even told our leftovers were with the tag, and left the restaurant without it. The coat check lady should have actually clued in what that extra tag is, since she works there. We debated going back to get it, but we didn't want to be treated like second class citizens when we know we will eat better somewhere else with the same price tag, as well as have better attitude / atmosphere. 

It was really a shame because I was expecting excellent hospitality."}
{"text":"The best value in the city - a fine dining experience for a very reasonable price - has me coming back on a regular basis. 

The only down-side is that the service is hit or miss. The table service is usually spot on, but on certain nights the front of the room can seem a bit cold. 

Though the food is very reasonably priced, the drinks can get pretty pricey at  $15/cocktail. Last time they were happy to oblige when I asked for an Americano with Campari. Extra points for off-menu flexibility.

Reservations: 1 day advance recommended.

The Damage: ~$50pp, pre-tax,tip,drinks.

Extra-tidbit: if you show up to your reservation early, there is a record store across the street (next to the condom shack) where I've been able to find some good steals (David Bowie LPs for under $5, hellz yea!)"}
{"text":"4/5 for summerlicious! One of the best pre-fixe in Toronto this summer! Recommend the crispy chicken salad or tuna tartare to start, grilled New York strip as mainland the cheese platter for dessert!"}
{"text":"I've either gotten better at picking Summerlicious restaurants or they've all stepped up their game. 

First off, I've walked past this restaurant so many times, it doesn't have a particularly standout storefront nor is the decor inside all that amazing. But from the second that we sat down to the end of our meal, everything was great. 

We had a Saturday night reservation. Even though we were 15 minutes early, we were seated right away. Our server was perfectly attentive and not at all hovering. We got a bottle of red, asked for it to be decanted, then ordered cocktails to start. My rhubarbella (rum, creme de framboise, tea, and rhubarb) was SO GOOD. I want another one right now. 

I had the BLT salad (pork belly instead of bacon) with sourdough croutons and it was a really good way to start my meal. My partner had the duck salad -- also really surprisingly well done for such an Asian-inspired dish. 

For my main, I had the rainbow trout. Skin was crispy and perfect. It came with \"lobster gumbo\" but it didn't quite taste like much. It reminded me more of polenta or grits, and it was kind of mushy, but it was outshone in any case by the fish. I suppose the only thing that could be improved upon here was the trout accompaniment. 

My partner's pork chop was done really well -- big piece, cooked just right throughout, not tough at all. Overall, good serving size. 

To end, I had the strawberry shortcake which was light and fluffy and fresh, it was just what I wanted. My partner had the cheese plate, which he enjoyed as well. 

The server again, was great throughout and kept our wine glasses full. The timing between the courses was also perfect -- just enough time to digest and not feel rushed. 

Would probably go back again, although the regular menu seems a tad overpriced."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a dinner before heading over to the Four Seasons Centre to watch the National Ballet. This is a perfect location, at Queen West and Simcoe, literally two minutes' walk from the opera house.

I was immediately struck with the ambience of the restaurant. The low incandescent lighting and the warm wood decor really come together to make a cosy atmosphere. Definitely suitable for couples but there were a number of groups present as well.

I decided to go with the 3-course pre-theatre menu for $38, available from 5:00-6:30 p.m. They were definitely attentive in making sure we would make it to our show on time. The starter was smoked salmon with capers on a bed of arugula. My main was grilled sea bass on lentils and spinach. Finally, I finished with the tangy panna cotta. My friend's roasted chicken looked tasty as well.

Service very attentive. I particularly liked how after clearing our mains, our server came around to sweep the crumbs off our table - although it embarrassingly revealed the oil stains I made on the tablecloth, ha ha.

Overall great experience. I did feel somewhat pressured to order extra sides/drinks with my meal but I was happy I stuck with my selections. But I really can't emphasize how convenient the location is. I'd be happy to come back and try more of the menu on my next trip!"}
{"text":"I went to nota bene for summerlicious and it was actually delicious! Had their duck salad which had mint and cilantro and cut up cucumber. Then their burger which has a beef patty AND beef brisket with delicious fries with herbs and Parmesan cheese. Then their fresh sugar donut with vanilla ice cream! So gooood! Want to go back"}
{"text":"I expected better from a high-end restaurant.  I had lunch with my co-workers and boss for our annual Christmas lunch.  The service was bad, and our server never came by to ask us how our lunch was.  The food lacked inspiration. Therefore the price never matched the taste satisfaction.  The atmosphere is cold and uninviting. 

Don't waste your time here.  You will get a better food experience in a food court."}
{"text":"Exquisite food, wine, service and atmosphere. A little pricey but great place for special occasions."}
{"text":"I've been holding off on writing this review because I so wanted to love it here, and in turn I wanted to come here and boast about how great my meal was.  At the end of the day it was just ok.  I'm not sure if I just built it up so big in my head, but I was slightly let down.

The positives... the dining room is beautiful and classy.  It's a great place for a fancy date or upscale celebration.  The staff is also top notch.  They are extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  Their scallops were cooked perfectly and actually renewed my love for them.  The cheese was also a delectable  end.

The negatives... I was disappointed with the hamachi ceviche.  I have a huge soft spot for ceviche, and it's pretty much a \"must order\" if I see it on the menu.  I felt like it was lacking flavour, and the corn nuts were just weird.  They added a weird, hard crunch that kind of cheapened the dish.  In hindsight, I wish I'd tried the tuna tartare instead.  I'm not sure why, but the impression of this dish just stuck with me, and unfortunately it impacted my overall impression of the restaurant.

Perhaps one day I'll have another chance to dine here, and I'll be able to gain a new impression."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, nice decor and good vibe. A bit overpriced for the quality of food. I went there with a group of friends and ordered a few dishes.the tagliolini pasta was good..we also ordered beef tenderloin which was also very tastey. The crunch salad and mozerella boffalo were very delicious. The staff were very nice but to some degree too nice. At one point there were four waiters at our table helping us with napkins and cleaning up our table which I find a bit too much. Overall it is worth trying for sure."}
{"text":"Not sure why people are rating this place so well. The kitchen at Nota Bene completely lacks respect for the ingredients that they are working with. 

The food isn't really as bad as the rating might suggest, but at this price point I feel I am well within my rights to rate it so low.  For $100 to $150 (which you will have to spend in order to leave full) I can think of so many other places in Toronto that are light years better than Nota Bene. 

So we went to Nota Bene before going to opening night of War Horse. Thankfully, War Horse was quite enjoyable. 


Nota Bene was very disappointing. It seems like the kitchen really doesn't take much pride in the food they are serving. They justify high prices because they do use some very expensive ingredients, but they don't treat them with any respect. 

Our lobster salad came with some very sad looking lettuce and beyond the blue cheese there was zero flavour. 

My scallops were cooked quite well, but the kimchi was drenched in what I can only assume is the same chili sauce that I can buy in the grocery store. There was no subtlety in the food. Either the flavours were over the top to the point of being unpleasant or were basically non-existent. So despite the fact that the scallop was technically well cooked, a little bit crisp on the outside but still nice and moist on the inside, it completely lacked flavour. Worse, if you take one bit of the kimchi, because of the super salty store bought chili sauce, you won't be able to taste anything else that you put in your mouth after that for a good 3-4 mouth fulls. 

I might be a food snob (...well I am a food snob...), but I find it completely unforgivable for a restaurant with main course dishes priced at $25 plus to serve me sauces that were purchased at the grocery store. WTF I can buy chili sauce from the grocery store! In fact I can make my own chili sauce better than the stuff at the grocery store. So if you are going to charge me over $25 for scallops with kimchi you really shouldn't be putting anything on the plate that wasn't made from scratch in your kitchen.....Oh and part of this rant is because the people next to us got the hamburger and it came with what was most definitely store bought ketchup, mustard and mayo. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE SUPER EASY TO MAKE. Please do not insult your customer by feeding them something they could squeeze out of the bottle themselves. That or significantly lower your prices. If your burger was $10, sure, fine, give me the Heinz ketchup, but your CHARGING $22! MAKE THE DAMN KETCHUP IN HOUSE!

For those of you who have read some of my other reviews. Nota Bene is going to replace Blu as the whipping boy fine of dinning in future reviews. At least at Blu the food was alright, it was just completely devoid of any character or imagination. Nota Bene, for the price that you are going to have to pay, is down right bad."}
{"text":"Crisp Duck Salad
Rabbit Soffritto
Sticky Toffee Pudding
Panna Cotta

... all were absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my sisters for a nice evening out. We ordered a delicious prosecco and after having a long look at the menu (where so many things looked good!), we finally ordered.

Since we were each getting a main and a side, we decided to just order one appetizer to share. The duck proscuitto was delicious! Wouldn't recommend sharing amongst 4 but definitely a good enough portion for 2. The slivers of salty proscuitto was nicely complemented with the pear, pecorino, and arugula. 

The french style onion rings were SO good! Pomme frites with shaved pecorino were good as well but if you'e trying to be cautious with the fried stuff then you definitely definitely have to get the french style onion rings which came in a delicious heap of thinly sliced and lightly battered goodness. We also ordered the rapini and the farm beets. I'm not a fan of rapini so can't comment on it as I did not have it, but the beets were simple and good.

I had the Grilled Rock Cornish Hen as my main and it was really really tasty! The meat was tender and not dry at all. The amount of rosemary was just right! The tasty bits of bacon with beans was a nice touch. I was so full but determined to finish it because it was so good! My sisters got: the scallops, \"rare\" hanger steak, and braised beef short ribs. I sampled all of them and they were very good as well! I'd only recommend getting the Grilled Rock Cornish Hen if you have an appetite because it was quite filling. 

For dessert we had the flourless chocolate fudge cake and the quebec yogurt panna cotta. both did not disappoint. I'm more of a chocolate person, so the flourless chocolate fudge cake was my fave. It was so light yet still rich enough. I couldn't believe it was flourless!

Overall, it was a great experience and the atmosphere was good as well. Service was lovely and professional. When you first walk into the restaurant, there's an optional coat check which I think is a nice courtesy. I'm not one of those \"coat check\" kind of people but I guess it's nice especially for those winter nights. The space is quite modern and much bigger than you'd expect. I felt that there was a mixture of people there, as in young, old...willing-to-indulge-on-occasion and indulge-is-the-regular-routine types. Although to be honest, I focused more on the delicious food and the good company! It might be a good idea to plan ahead and make reservations. The bottom line is if you're looking for fine dining that's still reasonable than you should definitely go here. It was certainly worth it and i can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Nota Bene is a good restaurant. 
Everything is tasty, the service is excellent, and atmosphere is wonderful, and the prices are actually reasonable for what you get (shocking in Toronto)
What it isn't is a 5 star restaurant (its more accurately a 3.5 star joint)
And for one simple reason - the food, while well prepared, is not SOULFUL - it isn't unctuous, mouth watering, 'can't believe how good this is food', its, 'ok this is tasty and looks nice' food. 
Evidence to this is that in  the 3 years I've been going there the menu HAS NOT CHANGED - this is an astounding fact, given the calibre of restaurant it claims to be
David Lee - SHAME on you...get in with the market fresh local thing and switch up the menu....every month AT LEAST - otherwise  you are relegated to the 3 star realm, just above Terroni and other poser places"}
{"text":"great place to go, foods are great and severs are awesome. even though we ordered mostly winterlishes  menu, we had a great experience there. All the dishes are so special, and I especially love the desert. brownies severed with cream and coffee souse, hot apple pie severed with ice cream. Cheese are great too but a little strong for Asian. but really had a great time there"}
{"text":"Me and my friends all time favourite, always consistent when we go.

great service and dining environment, perfect for a casual business occasion or just simply somewhere nice to go with friends. 

LOVE their crispy duck salad, so sad they took it away after the new menu

Used to make the BEST cream caramel in town, but that's off the menu as well :( 

Please please bring them back!!"}
{"text":"I visited Nota Bene for winterlicious back in January. Most notably the utensils and plates were huge; almost insultingly so for the portions provided. I don't mind paying for quality food but after a three course meal plus fries and all the bread (they have endless free bread that is delicious) my SO and I felt like we needed to get something else before we went home.
The meat might be cooked on the same grill as the fish. My fish tasted like meat and my SO's meat tasted like fish. The dessert was amazing but comically small and the spoon provided was so large the whole dessert fit on it.

Overall: Eat the food or don't the plate looks the same."}
{"text":"Feel like it's overrated.. Service is extraordinary but the food is just okay. 
The desserts are quite good but not gonna recommend anything else"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker who was visiting for the weekend, I must say this restaurant would have a wait every single night if it was in Manhattan.  Absolutely amazing culinary experience, from the service and decor to each dish we had.  The downside to eating here is the subsequent meals I had were doomed to disappoint.

Our server (Mel) was amazing...she made flawless recommendations and clearly was not just upselling us, but rather making spot on recos for what we asked about.  Amazing server!

Here is what I ate (although our table ordered more!):
Matzo ball soup- this is a dish that is near and dear to my heart as someone from NYC with a european background.  The kitchen nailed it!  Not too salty, super flavorful, and the matzo balls were perfect.
Tuna Sashimi- great cuts of tuna in a very flavorful ceviche, a bit of spice but not too much to take away the taste of the tuna. A+.
Cavatelli- the mushroom bolognese was ridiculous.  Perfect amount of truffle oil made every single bite heavenly with the aroma.
Ricotta ravioli- I could have eaten 50 of these! Thank god the kitchen did good portion control for me.
Mediterranean Seabass- this is how seabass should be cooked.  Soft and buttery, but not overcooked and not too flaky.  An amazing piece of fish.
Onion rings- addicting! Could not stop grabbing them in between bites!

Also- you definitely want to leave room for dessert.  We were utterly stuffed but still ordered the chocolate cake and the Apple Crumble (with whiskey ice cream), and thank the lord we did!

Thank you Nota Bene! Made our trip to Toronto so great."}
{"text":"We were there for my boyfriend's birthday. Love the paintings on the wall. However, the service was mediocre, our waiter was not rude but not friendly either. He doesn't seem to want to be there. 

Food was good. The sweet potatoes fried were outstanding. 4 of us have the halibut special, 3 of us like it. One of our friend find it over cooked. :-(

Nota Bene have free corkage fee after 9pm."}
{"text":"I went with a friend to Nota Bene for Winterlicious 2016. We booked the reservation about an hour prior and did not have any issues with the reservation part. It was really nice of them to seat us early as well. 

Atmosphere
The ambience of the restaurant was pretty romantic.. so if you don't want to be sitting beside couples holding hands and staring longingly in each others eyes for the rest of your stay, I would definitely recommend coming with a bigger group so you can be seated in the larger table areas. It seems like a good place for a date as the lighting is dim and the whole ambience of the restaurant feels very intimate. There is a coat check and the dress of the restaurant is more on the formal side, so when my friend and I stumbled into the restaurant we definitely felt a little under dressed. 

Food
The menu from the Toronto Winterlicous website does not 100% reflect the items they served for Winterlicious, so a note of caution if you're going specifically for something. The food was a little underwhelming considering the price that was paid. The food we ordered came cold to the table and was generally not very memorable. 

Service
The appetizers came pretty quickly, but the wait between finishing the appetizer, main and dessert was definitely too long; about 30-40 minutes. The wait staff was not really attentive to our table and so were kind of left hanging on things like water, drinks, the bill, etc."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. 
My boyfriend and I reserve this restaurant for special occasions.
We are never disappointed. 
Make sure you order the frites. I also order the Ceviche as an app almost every time I go. Delicious!
The service is amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for a work party, so the food selection was limited. My favourite was the crispy duck salad...so very good!

The highlight of the night was the BEST amaretto sour drink I have ever had. I order this drink whenever I'm out and having an alcoholic beverage. I was wondering why the bartender was taking so long to make the drink. Well, he explained...he was adding egg white to the drink to make the foamy part. 

Now, I know that sounds gross...egg white in alcoholic drink. But whatever. It tasted damn good.

Visit Nota Bene and get the amaretto sour."}
{"text":"Although Nota Bene is in my neighborhood I hadn't managed to visit until Natalie T.'s UYE.

I had the Jennifer's Stilton Brisket Beef Burger ($22) with fries on the side. 

It is a baseball side of meat with caramelized onions and blue cheese as a top and the pairing of the flavours were well balanced. Although I followed the server's recommendation for medium it turned out to be quite rare, which was fine as I enjoy meat on the rare side. 

And while the burger was good, I would not order it again. It was a pretty good hamburger but in a city that has a lot of good burgers, it did not stand out. 

That said I think I may have made the error in ordering a burger at a restaurant like Nota Bene, as every other dish would better feature the skills of the kitchen. In a fine dining restaurant a burger on the menu is often a courtesy to picky or unadventurous eaters.

On the bright side the service was impeccable with the right balance of attentiveness without being intrustive. Our server gained bonus points when she offered up individual bills for our large group.

I haven't written off Nota Bene but I'd like to try it again, perhaps choosing a more appropriate meal that allows the chef to shine."}
{"text":"Awesome food, excellent drinks and a cool atmosphere.   I was there for my birthday and the mixologist hooked me up with a great cocktail called an \"Air Canada\".  I will definitely hit them up when I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed based on the good yelp reviews.  I was dining alone and did not get a great reception from the wait staff...the bacon was undercooked on my scallop entrée and it was way overpriced for the quality.  The cheese plate was okay...nothing great about their choices.  The wine was okay also."}
{"text":"This place is too expensive for what you're getting.

I figure if you're going to spend some money, go all out - not 3/4 of the way with NB.

Onion rings were recommended - huge pile! But they were cold so I sent them back. Fish of the day was basically their version of fish and chips made with seabass. It was....not great. Not bad... but Harbord Fish n Chips is about 4x better and 1/3 as expensive.

Had a solid champagne glass of mango juice for about $7. 

The space and atmosphere are really impressive here  - as is the service. So that's positive, I guess."}
{"text":"Adlee is the best waiter I have ever had and I would honestly go back to this exquisite restaurant all over again to be served by Adlee! He is truly wonderful and the food was absolutely delicious. We are out of towners and told Adlee we planned to go to the CN tower for a drink but didn't have reservations, and by the time we showed up to the CN Tower, Adlee's friend who manages the CN Tower restaurant already had a table ready for us! I was truly charmed and so grateful for Adlee being such a great impression of Toronto! Adlee is a keeper and excellent experience at Nota Bene!"}
{"text":"Used to be really good. Prices seem to have increased significantly and quality has decreases. Unfortunate as I very much enjoyed dining there."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but hadn't been back for a couple years even though I remembered loving the food.  So imagine my excitement when the husband booked us a dinner there to celebrate our anniversery.

As previously, the service was knowledgable and attentive without being intrusive.  The ambiance is soothing, the decor tasteful and the wine list satisfying.  At the recommendation of our server I tried the Inzolia, a white from Sicily that I had never had before, and I'm definitely a fan!  We shared the tuna tartare for starter, it was decent, nice texture, fresh, but I just didn't find it super flavourful.  The ceviche is better.

Husband ordered the braised beef short rib.  It was a large serving of meat, nicely cooked, with a mixture of a few different sauces, but maybe slightly overpowering in the meat content (read: it could've come with a warning that it is basically just a huge piece of meat). Some veggies would have added a nice balance.

I tried the rabbit soffrito.  I've had a similar dish here in the past that had made me virtually dance while sitting on my chair (means I'm loving my food) but this time, it was lacking in flavour, it just tasted mostly of butter and little else.

Overall, a nice experience due to the ambiance and service, and there are certainly a lot of places where you could do much worse.  But I have to give it 3 stars, because despite solid craftmanship and the high quality of ingredients, they just didn't come together tonight to elevate the dishes to 'extraordinary'.  So, a little dissapointing."}
{"text":"Loved it!  The food was seriously amazing.  I think I have a new favourite restaurant.   I've been dying to try this place since I found out it's owned by the former owners of Splendido.  Do not be put off by the location, as we all know the restaurants are usually just average around Queen and John.  Dinner for two with a shared appetizer, two mains, shared dessert and two glasses of wine was just above $100.  That's a steal for such high quality ingredients and amazing flavours.  The atmosphere feels slightly like a lounge/club, but I would rather have that instead of a stuffy atmosphere.  The only problem is you have to think ahead and make reservations (I struggle with this) so I tried to get in by calling that afternoon but there was nothing available.  Instead we hung out in the lounge and had a couple of cocktails until a table was ready about 45 minutes later.  Not to worry though the place was still packed and you don't feel rushed even when the kitchen was closing at 11."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. 

Good: Tasty food. Reasonable menu selection with good deals on daily specials. A few of the cocktails are interesting! Decor: suitable for date.

Bad: Misses the mark a little for an upscale restaurant. The food is tasty but not stunning. 

Excellent: The side dishes (pommes frites or onion rings) for $4. Perfect for \"filling up the corners\" and as an appetizer to share.

You will have an excellent meal, but it won't be stunning."}
{"text":"I think this place deserves much better reviews! Opentable has it at a well deserved 4.5* and 200plus reviews. Food was spectacular and service was on point,  this is one of my favorite restos and a great place to eat apps all dinner."}
{"text":"Had a nice romantic dinner over there and I loved it. The best thing about the whole experience was the service. These guys are very attentive, don't bother you too much and bring everything on time.

Quick tip a bottle of sparkling wine is $45 one of the best deals over there and it actually tastes really good.

The food was great too if you add an ambiance  and location you got yourself 5 stars: service, food, location, decor! Worth you money for sure (we spent $200 for two that includes that $45 sparkling wine)."}
{"text":"*** 4.5 Stars ***

I was at Nota Bene last night to celebrate my SO's birthday.  I made the reservation well in advance and the restaurant was great at following up to confirm my reservation the day before.

We arrived about an hour earlier than our reservation and the staff were able to accommodate our reservation change.  

Service was fantastic, we were greeted immediately after arriving to our table for our drink orders.  I was impressed on how often they checked up on us through out our meal.

Nota Bene has a pre-fix menu for the theater crowd; you have the option of 2 or 3 courses to choose from.  We opted for the regular menu.  Here is what we ordered:

Appetizer
Big Eye Tuna Tartare - OMG, absolutely divine, perfectly seasoned and the taro chips were a great crunch factor.  I would order this again in a heart-beat

Mains
Beef Brisket Burger - delish, mouth-watering burger goodness.  I love the caramelized onions.  Watch out for the cheese, it is some strong stuff.  The fries were super yummy.

Beef Tenderloin - melted in your mouth, cooked to perfection.  My SO really enjoyed his meal

Brussel Spouts as a side - great side dish, love the touch of heat and sweetness of the brussel sprouts

Dessert
Sticky Toffee Pudding - lovely sweet note to end a wonderful meal, it was great with the cappuccinos we ordered

Overall, it was one memorable meal.  I will definitely be back for future special occasions and client dinners.  Make Nota Bene one of your restaurants to try out in the city and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight at Nota Bene was top notch!  

We had dinner here before seeing Miss Saigon at the Four Seasons.
I like the menu here.  It's small but creative.  They even have a pre-theater special (2 courses for $32, 3 courses for $42).

I was going to go for the special, but I had heard the burgers could rival some of the best in the city.

Dude, it's a $44 dollar burger.  
What makes a burger worth $44 dollars?

* A 9 oz patty of \"forked wagyu brisket burger\"
* It's got foie gras.  Everything is better with foie gras.
* Pancetta  (not as exciting as foie gras)
* Truffle Mayonnaise (equally exciting as foie gras)

Now that's what I call a fk'n fantastic burger!!!
It's fat on fat on fat and oh so good.

The burger was fall apart soft, fat-marbled, juice dripping deliciousness.  I don't exactly know what they do to wagyu cows but they end up as damn good burgers.

The service made you feel like a movie star.  Everyone was so nice and friendly.  We had a fantastic time!!!

Next time I have to try this crispy duck salad... and maybe order the burger again. :P

This restaurant is one of my favorite dinner spots for sure!"}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious. Amazing ambience. Maintained excellent service throughout despite it being Winterlicious. All the food that we ordered was top-notch. The duck liver parfait appetizer was a definite highlight. All the main courses at the table were perfect (we tried the seabass, pasta, and pork chop with is an impressive portion size and not dry at all). Desserts were fabulous too (clementine sorbet, banoffee)."}
{"text":"For my lover's birthday I planned a trip to Toronto, and was searching for a gorgeous and fabulous new restaurant to take us to. With so many to choose from, how to decide upon the perfect place? Once again, Yelp to the rescue!

Nota Bene is located on trendy Queen Street West. A cool and subtle exterior gave way to a very crowded and beautifully lit bar area. Tasteful art decorated the walls, and the crowd was stylish and sophisticated.
We started our evening seated at the bar, since our table was not yet ready. The wine list was varied and interesting, and the bartenders quick and efficient.

The dining area is upstairs, and while not as intimate as many of the Vancouver restaurants we frequent (it's basically a huge room), this is definitely a place to see and be seen, so the open concept works here. The service was flawless - and I am unforgiving when it isn't. 
As for the food? There are not enough words to sum it up. My lover and I, who never run out of things to say to each other, were silenced by the flavors and aromas of the dishes in front of us. The pommes frites for the table are a must - how can you say no when they're dusted with grated pecorino and served with savoury sauce? For vegetarians, the mushroom pasta was delicious and surprisingly hearty, and the black cod is done to perfection.

Our advice is to forgo dessert but splurge on a cheese plate. You can choose 3, 5 or 7 different types which are all explained thoroughly, and as a bonus, many were local.

We'll definitely come here on another special occasion!"}
{"text":"In the spirit of Yelp Eats! my family decided to try a new fancier/classy kind of restaurant.

(If you want my overall opinion, skip to the end!)

From the street:
I would say that the restaurant stands out from it's surroundings in a good way.  However, if I didn't look up where the restaurant was, I probably would have had a really hard time finding it because the name doesn't stand out from the street.  

Service:
From the greeting hostess to the servers, the service was friendly, polite, and very efficient.  The server was more than willing to point out his favourites when I asked. (I like to ask servers their favourite selections.  I find it's a good indication if they actually know the food that they're serving.)  And I have to agree with his selections.


Food:
I started with the Cavatelli Pasta.  It was delicious!  Even better than I had anticipated.  If you like truffles/mushroom flavour, you'll love this appetizer!  It was pretty hardy, too.  I think that it is big enough to be someone's main.  The sauce was thick enough to have flavour and stick to the pasta, but thin enough that it didn't taste chunky or overly rich.

For my main, I had Jennifer's Stilton Beef Brisket Burger.  I ordered mine medium-rare (as per the server's suggestion).  It came with carmelized onions and a slice of cheese similar to blue cheese.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese... and the server immediately offered to replace it with a different slice of cheese.  So he brought out a slice of white cheddar instead.  The bun for the burger had perfectly crispy crust, but was nice and soft without being chewy.  When I took my first bite, it was soooo juicy and delicious!  The brisket burger also comes with a side of fries which were also really good.  Overall, I would highly recommend this as your main.

I chose the Pistachio Ice Cream for dessert.  It comes with a sugar cookie (one of my favourites).  The flavour is very different from what you'd expect.  It took my second bite to really like this ice cream.  It's very rich, but if you like pistachios, you'll understand that the flavour can be addicting.  Would I get it again? DEFINITELY.


Other foods I tasted from others:
APPETIZERS
Crisp Duck Salad : duck was perfectly cooked and crispy indeed!
Big Eye Tuna Tartare : if you like tuna sashimi, you'll love this!  So good!
Salt Cod Fritters : least favourite part was the salt cod fritters because it was too salty for my taste.  But the rest of the garnishings (i.e. the quail eggs, chorizo, and greenery were delicious.

MAINS
Sea Scallops: cooked to perfection!
Rabbit Soffrito, Pappardelle Pasta: the pappardelle pasta is super good and I like the rabbit, but according to the person, some pieces were tough.

SIDES
Shaved Onion Rings: these were just okay.  I found them way too salty for my taste. I would recommend asking for less salt on these.
Sautéed Rapini: also just okay.  I prefer them with a bit of oyster sauce.
Sea Salted Peppers: I enjoyed the peppers.  I found it refreshing and the peppers were perfectly sweet.


DESSERT
Double Chocolate Brownie: this was sweet and not too heavy (normally I don't like brownies because I find them too heavy, but I liked this one!)
Salted Caramel Truffle: others with me really liked these, but personally I found mine to be too salty and too sweet. Maybe it was because it was one of the last things I ate and all the flavours by the end were overwhelming?


OVERALL:
I liked everything about this restaurant - the ambience, the atmosphere, the service.  I loved my selections for the appetizer, main and dessert.  The reason for the only 4 out of 5 stars is because I found that much of the food was too salty.  I think that the sea salt was a little over-used.  By the time I finished my wine, you could see all the salt that had been left behind and ended up stuck to the bottom and sides of my wine glass - that's how much salt was used. (FYI - I drink my wine through my front teeth, so no it was not backwash.)

Would I go back?  Yes.  Would I bring a friend? Definitely."}
{"text":"Note Ben Eh. 
I'd make a terrible foodie mainly because I can never remember anything I eat beyond the meal I had 2 hours ago, but this one I remember - If only because I took the menu home with me. I had the Las Americas feature menu with wine pairings. I recommend trying this, but if you're reading this after January 28th, you're out of luck -since that's when it ends. That said, I would certainly try any feature menu they might introduce in the future based on my experience with the Las Americas menu. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Without reservations for a weekend evening, my friend and I were directed to the bar area upon arriving. There was a neat coat check area prior to entering, which was a nice addition that I was not expecting. The bar area was lively - much more casual compared to the dining room area, and offered great views of the bustling streets outside. 

We shared an appetizer of Mozzarella Di Bufala - a mild cheese dish. I'm not a fancy cheese type of person, but the this cheese was creamy, milky and tasted excellent with the surrounding roasted peppers, basil pesto and lemon preserves. The pesto was especially memorable since it tasted so fresh and complimented really well the texture of the cheese. 

For the entree, I was so tempted to order the rabbit dish, but ended up with the Glazed Black Cod. The fish was smoked and served with small slivers of salt on top. The potatoes on the side were amazing - I was even skeptical whether they were potatoes or not! This dish overall was gentle in flavour - well suited for people who prefer less salt/sauces on their dishes, such as myself! =)

My friend had the Pulled Beef Short Ribs on Fettuccine, which was the special of the day. The sauce was cream based, but not thick at all. This dish was more hearty and I would highly recommend this if you like meat!

I thought this place was quite pricey for the food, but the convenient location and the friendly service made my dinner a great experience. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I went to Nota Bene for lunch with two of my coworkers.  I can only comment on the two dishes that I tried.

The beef brisket burger was just alright.  The blue cheese was overpowering and my beef patty was not very juicy.  The proportion size was filling.  The frites were ok, nothing special.  Guess it would have been wiser to order something other than the burger at a place like this but I wasn't feeling anything else at the time.  

I tried my friend's braised beef short ribs over pappardelle which I also found to be just average.  The flavor was too one dimensional and I could see myself getting bored with the dish very quickly in favor of something else. 

For both dishes they used quality ingredients but it seemed like they did not know how to work the ingredients together very well.  

As for the ambiance, it was clean cut and modern but not too memorable in my opinion.  The service was good, the waiters and greeter were pleasant.

I will likely go again at some point to try their salads, namely the lobster and the crispy duck salads, both of which i've heard good things about.  

So far I think this place is overhyped, not sure why though..."}
{"text":"Completely not worth the price.

Truffle pasta tasted nothing like truffles -- it was like eating styrofoam shavings.   That someone in the kitchen thought this was OK to serve speaks volumes about their palettes, or scruples.

Seabass was cooked well, but also lacked flavour.

Haven't been this disappointed in a place in a long while."}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch a few days ago.  As soon as I walked in, (solely by the way I was dressed), I felt out of place.  TONS of suits. I am not a suit.  However, feeling out of place was all in my head because the waitstaff was awesome.

I had the octopus appetizer (the day's special) - it was pretty delicious. It was charred and awesomely seasoned.  With some really great olive oil and some arugula and shaved onions for some flavour. mmmmm......

My next course was the soft shell crab sandwich.  It was probably one of the richest sandwiches I had ever had.  Everything was doused in butter or deepfried...I could only eat half the sandwich.  I did, of course eat the I 2nd morsel of soft shell crab.  How could i pass that up?!?!

I must admit...the portions are deceivingly small. But going back to the office and sitting at my desk was puuuure torture.  I could barely walk."}
{"text":"Now, to be fair, I was here for a work dinner, which is to say, I didn't have to deal with the bill and that's probably for the best as my wallet would have just shriveled up like an old sloppy balloon. Aside from cost? This place is amazing.

We had a delicious red which was medium priced (on their list, expensive by most other lists). The staff were incredibly helpful and informed when it came to both booze and food. For starters I had a crispy duck salad which was served on a bed of cold noodles. The duck was indeed crispy (read: delicious!!) and the noodles were flavorful. I could have done without the chopsticks because I think they're pretentious in a non-Asian restaurant, but it wasn't the end of the world. I ordered the flank steak for my main which came with a side of delicious shoe string fries, cooked to perfection. The steak was outstandingly moist and succulent. I love me a good steak and Nota Bene did not disappoint. A side of spinach completed the perfect main course. We followed it up with the cheese plate. Don't bother trying to choose, they're all good. When she asked which ones we wanted we just said, \"yes\" and it was the right choice. There is something for everyone there.

It bears repeating how nice and knowledgeable the head of house and wait staff were. We left long after everyone else had hit the road and servers were clearly keen to go home but they still waved us goodbye with good cheer and friendly smiles. All in all a great experience if you're not paying and a great (but pricey) one if you are."}
{"text":"As I frequent the Opera more, Nota Bene has been my go to for pre-opera nosh. I don't eat at the main dining area, but the bar area, which is really nice (you can have your dinner there too).
Bar Bites are so yummy, especially the Sliders, Cod Fritters, grilled cheese, and the Suckling Pig (YUM!YUM!YUM!). 

Yesterday, Nota Bene was having a Champagne special so in addition to the Perrier Jouet, they had the Veuve for $19(!!) and a Vintage of something and a Rose. If the special is still on, I would highly recommend trying the varieties. The Vintage was really yummy.

Service is always impeccable: water glasses continually filled and they make sure you are never without a glass of something else:) 

Really love this place!"}
{"text":"I went to Nota Bene with a colleague while on a business trip to Toronto.  The room was nice and while it was busy, it never felt cramped as is often the case in high end restaurants.  I was tempted by the lobster salad but went for the hamachi ceviche instead for my starter.  The flavours were excellent, with a big blast of lime/vinegar that was bracing but didn't overwhelm the fish.  We pared it with a glass of white recommended by the waiter and it was a nice combo.  My only quibble was the portion was a bit on the small side - and I am not a fan of giant portions.  For my main I had the Thursday special - papardelle with a ragu.  It was really good.  If you order it, save some bread because you will want to sop up the last of the sauce (which is about the highest praise you can give a sauce in my book).  We had a nice Amarone with it.

I think 5 stars should be saved for destination dining, so 4 stars is my way of saying that I expect this is one of the best places to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"3 stars because it was just so average. I came here on a weekday for drinks and bar snacks after work. From 4-7pm the bar snacks are $4 and after 7pm they go up to $7. We orders both of the sliders and also the calamari and one of the cold cuts dishes. The sliders were delish (especially the beef slider)! The calimari was also good and it was served grilles - not deep fried which was a pleasant variation. The dinky portion of cold cuts were disappointing though *womp* *womp*."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the service was on the slow side. 
food
Big eye tuna tartar- 3/5 bland
Tunisian octopus- 3.5/5
Saturday dinner special- 5/5 amazing
sticky toffee pudding- 5/5 best part about it was the \"spotted dick\" ice cream
creme caramel- 4/5"}
{"text":"The crisp duck salad was the best part of the meal. It was refreshing, light, and savoury. I had the bone marrow and rib eye steak for a main. 

\"COTE DE BOEUF
Cumbrae Farms ribsteak & roasted bone marrow, pickles, parsley, horseradish, mustard, frites \"

The bone marrow was overwhelmed with pickle & horseradish garnish, definitely not a fan as it took away from the bone marrow flavour. Would not reorder. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare."}
{"text":"Nota Bene hits the nail on the head when it comes to clientele and location. While I agree with fellow Yelpers that NB is too expensive for what it is, they're location caters to the downtown working crowd who are more than likely using corporate credit cards to pay for their meals. In this case, heck yes I'll spend $25 on the smallest piece of Halibut for lunch.

I recently came to NB on a business lunch in the same situation as I mentioned above: on someone else's dime. However, besides the high priced lunch, NB is quite a lovely place to dine. 

The restaurant's decor is simple-sophistication: clean simple lines and nice finishes, complete with an intimate eating space conducive to keeping your business to yourself without sharing with your neighbour. The servers are friendly yet discreet and maintain a high level of professionalism during service. 

Needless to say, the meal was fantastic. The Halibut was cooked perfectly with the simplest flavours and buttery melt-in-your-mouth texture. The garlic-sauteed rapini was also cooked with the same perfection - steamed, sauteed, yet still maintaining a nice crispness.

The cappuccino I ordered following lunch was mediocre, but that was to be expected.

Honourable Mentions:
- our glasses were never empty (i thoroughly appreciate a server who is conscious of this simple gesture)
- a well rounded menu that would keep both vegetarians and meat eaters tres satisfied."}
{"text":"After reading the rave reviews for this place we decided to give this place a try. Walked in asked for a table for two the main dining area was reasonably busy with the bar area supporting 2-3 people (not a bad thing as we were in on Thursday evening around 7 a day before new years eve) A quick note here while were standing outside a couple of people ( I assume regulars walked by and recommend us to try the place always a good sign IMO) After checking in our jackets were seated promptly. We ordered sparkling rose' as we were in somewhat a celebration mode.  Bread was brought in promptly as well with some olive oil (too strong IMO and it would help a shot of balsamic and some  garlic)  Both of decided to order the burger and thinking it would not be enough decided to order some tuna tartar to share. Tuna looked beautiful but lacked in taste as some parts were stringy. I wish they had cut it into chunks so we could enjoy a bit of texture and the color. We decided to switch to some prosecco after the rose'. Anyway onto the mains the burger looked beautiful the fries were ok IMO and over cooked on the outside and were how do I say empty in the center. Now for the burger  we order as per the chef's recommendation Medium rare. the first bite was nice and as I could see the meat was nice fatty and fresh. After that it sorta went downhill. The bottom part of the bun became soggy with all the fat and I had to eat my burger upside down from there on. My friend could't even finish his burger and left 1/3 of it. We decided to order some creme caramel. The caramelized popcorn were good but the flan was ok. For the money we paid for the meal I think it was average at best going on with the tradition of lacking high end meals in TO. I guess I should just stick to mid level places in TO as the supposedly high end meal places have a lot of catching up to do with Montreal and Vancouver let alone the rest of NA."}
{"text":"It took me forever to get to Nota Bene, probably because I was never in the \"right\" company.  Then my BFF flew in.  He was just the extravagance I needed.  Note that he is also a food enigma who eats microwaved chicken fingers (ewww) with as much enjoyment as he does a $400 tasting menu. What a nut.  

I love Toronto when he and his fiancé are here. It puts me in a good mood!  Woot woot.  I decided to take them to a nice dinner on Friday, so I booked a table at Nota. I knew what I was going to order before I even walked in. The female counterpart of the fashionable duo I often dined with had recommended the crisp duck salad. She insisted I would love it. I did. Like hard.

I was impressed with everything about Nota from the dining room to the service. All the dishes were extravagantly plated and delicious, save and except the hangar steak. It was a bit of a miss for all three of us. It was far too chewy and very reminiscent of the chimichurri steak we had at Foxley (the latter's was better).
 
Refreshing and crispy, with so many flavours and textures. 

The special of the day was the swordfish. I'm not a fan of the fish itself so it's hard to say whether I liked it or not, but if I were to be objective, I'd say it was good.

A beautiful plate with well-seasoned chanterelle mushrooms and rapini.

I loved the fries with pecorino and my BFF loved the salt cod fritters with iberico chorizo, quail eggs and fries. We also appreciated the additional sides we got courtesy of the kitchen. 

As I am writing this blog, I just realized that the chef, David Lee, is the David Lee of Splendido pre-2009. Splendido pre-2009 was one of my absolute favourite restaurants. I will have to go back and see how it is now. I suppose it makes complete sense then that I loved Nota. I'm not sure I loved it as much as I did Splendido, but they are very different. Can't compare apples and kumquats.

 I am craving that duck salad again. It's seriously perfect. Sumac-dusted green papaya slaw, cashews and some chilli flakes. It's listed as an appetizer ($15), but I highly recommend you ask them to make it an entrée (add $7). You can thank me later."}
{"text":"I've been to Nota Bene a few times, and generally have had good experiences.

I have to give them a shout out for being EXCELLENT when I brought someone who has a LOT of allergies last year. They requested that they make them pasta with butter and Parmesan, and the server did not blink. It's great to know that they will accommodate such off-menu requests. Service here has always been 5 stars.

Went again this week for a UYE to try their burger. I decided to split a burger and two sides with another person (one burger and two sides=2 meals?), and I was impressed when they not only plated the burger separately (with two dishes of fries and two dishes of mustard, mayo and ketchup), but they also made up two small patties instead of cutting a single burger in half. It was a small touch, but I felt it really spoke to the integrity of the service, and also of the food. A burger like that would have lost a lot of juices as soon as it was cut into (something I didn't think of beforehand). By having two patties it remained juicy (and a little oily). 

The onion rings we ordered were thin and crispy. Not greasy at all. Excellent. The spicy brussel sprouts were also fantastic. The burger was good, but not my favourite thing I've had here. However it  was hearty and filling, and I enjoyed the blue cheese as a topping.

Do note that this isn't a cheap experience. Most mains were over $30, and desserts were $12. The burger was $22. My half burger, half of two sides, and a single chocolate truffle to end my meal came to almost $30, and that's without alcohol or coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent food...nice place...for some reason...seems to have become the new cool place to go in Toronto...
We had the added pleasure of watching Brian Mulroney and Ivan Fecan dine together...then watch Mulroney walk around the place...pressing as much flesh as he could...as if he was still campaigning for something...very funny."}
{"text":"You know when you hear good things about a place and when you get there, your experience is nowhere near the expectation that was set?  Yup.  This is pretty much what happened to me.  

So I was reading a very positive review by a seemingly reputable food blogger about Nota Bene and their happy hour.  $4 for various dishes between 4-7pm on a weekday seemed like a good idea.  

When my friends and I walked in, it was pretty quiet.  We ordered some non-alcoholic drinks which were alright.  

We were somewhat disappointed by the skimpy calamari.  The photo I saw, had at least a double portion of what we received.  The burrata was reasonable.  Two pieces.  The bresaola was on the skimpy side too.  The flavours were good and the service was fine.  I'm sure their regular menu is more satisfying.  

In the future, I will not be taking the advice of a food blogger who eats for free and gives advice on food they didn't have to pay for.  

FYI: According to the server, the menu literally changed TODAY.  Boooo.....  No fried chicken...  :("}
{"text":"I have always loved this place for the excellent food and ambiance and recommended it to many for years. We booked an early seating for New Years Eve a few weeks ahead of time. On arrival we were taken to a little boring side room, not the main dining room we love so much. The main room was never full to capacity at any point in the evening.
Service was excellent. Food was pretty good but not up to the standards we were used to. 
When one pays the high prices of fine dining in Toronto, it's not just for the food, but for the total experience. Being sequesters to the anteroom without being advised or asked was disappointing.  
I'm not sure I will return and that is a shame.

Update: Jan. 2, 2014
How nice, a follow up phone call to discuss and an apology. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"This place would be 4 stars except for a few misses. First the good: Onion rings are great. For entrees, we had the burger, crab cake and cornish hen. All were very well done. There was one decent size crab cake per order, which seemed a little on the small side for a dinner portion. The other entree portions were fine. Desert was just ok. Pistachio Ice cream was good, but nothing special. The downsides were that the waiter seemed distracted and after we had ordered we heard another waiter talking about specials for the night. They sounded good and had our waiter told us about them, we might have changed what we ordered. Also, the restaurant charges for soda and tea refills. $4.50 per small glass seems a little steep. Dinner for 3 was ~250 before tip. (2 alcohol drinks, 3 entrees, 2 sides and 3 deserts)"}
{"text":"I went there for a bday dinner because places like bucca and enoteca sociale wouldnt accommodate a large group and it was just OK. 
For the price, you can definitely find better food in the city. It was interesting to see that the food was very asian x italian inspired. But none of the dishes really grabbed me in a way that was unforgettable. 
I went with a group of 17 people so we pretty much got to taste everything on the menu. I noticed a lot of people praising the duck salad and the truffle pasta on yelp so i tried them. They were both just OK. The duck salad tasted like something you could easily pick up in any vietnamese restaurant (delicious- pieces of cilantro, peanuts, spices... but like I said, you can get that at any yummy vietnamese restaurant in the city), it just wasn't imaginative enough and inspired enough. The truffle pasta was again, just OK. the flavours lacked that something special. The heavy aroma of mushrooms are great and all but is there anything else? 
Meats were fine but not great either. If you want great steak, go to Jacobs, Habour 60 or heck I've had better steak at the Keg and Ruth's Chris as well. 
Nothing was terrible, and it was an enjoyable evening but the food just wasn't impressive. 

oh we had SUCH trouble looking for parking. It's at queen and university so good luck finding parking. We circled the vicinity a few times and gave up and settled for a spot quite far from the place."}
{"text":"So glad I was able to taste the Summerlicious 2016 menu here. Duck salad to start was amazing; crispy, well seasoned and fresh. Pickerel fish as an entree tasted just as good; for a usually bland white fish, it was cooked and seasoned to perfection and was complimented by some tasty sauteed spinach. For dessert I had the best mango/coconut milk sorbet combo I've ever tasted. The sorbet had a really strong sweet-sour flavour that was balanced perfectly by the coconut milk...would gladly come back to Nota Bene just for this dessert!!

Service was excellent here. We asked for recommendations, and were given humbled opinions by our server, who described each dish for us with enthusiasm. He made our dinner experience comfortable and smooth, refilling our glasses at the right times and making small talk that made us feel welcomed.

The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was great. It felt modern, chic, trendy, but also warm and welcoming. The only reason for the missing star is the fact that the menu items are a bit pricey for the portion size you get...the 3-course summerlicious menu came close to $60, with each dish being smaller than one would expect. It filled me up, but I am also a small asian girl...

Conclusion: as long as you have some money to spend, spend it at Nota Bene--no regrets!"}
{"text":"Eat here if you are looking for extremely arrogant service, small pretentious plates and unreasonable pricing."}
{"text":"I went there on a Monday night. It was packed. 
We had a reservation and the table was ready. Staff were friendly, however waiter was a bit too attentive. Cleared my wine glass before it was empty and tried to do the same with my appetiser. Though understandably he was busy so I understand he was probably trying to do as much as he could when he walked by his tables.

Appetizer- tuna tartar and the yellow tail ceviche. YUM both were very fresh.

Main- Halibut. Meh. Lacked flavour. It was a nice piece of fish but it lacked flavour, the grilled veggies it came with were slightly overdone.

Desert- Brownie with caramel- YUUUMMMMM
              3 cheeses- OMG! :) :) , generous portions and fantastic cheese. All three were creamy and delicious. One was an aged cheddar from Quebec, the other two I do not remember what they were called, but one was from Switzerland and one was Canadian.

I recommend Nota Bene, for appetizers and desert and drinks. I'm sure they have yummy mains, just not what I had."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the summer tasting menu. It was fantastic. The food was expertly prepared and perfectly balanced. The chef is a true pro. The servers were attentive and caring and helpful. The wine pairing was brilliant. Also appreciate the fact that when you call the restaurant, they actually answer the phone. So rare these days. Everything about our dinner was awesome."}
{"text":"Service
My mood is sour since my entire post got deleted in one button, seriously what is wrong? The guy manning the coat check area should be an actor, and I mean in A+ films. He could be the sidekick to Captain America, that's right he was that gorgeous. My boyfriend could care less. I liked how our waitress was professional and prompt. Sometimes waiters/waitresses try to make conversation when they suck at it, this one knew when to intercept and when to step back. Good job.

Food 
I think I was very lucky or that Nota Bene was THAT GOOD. The clam chowder was a surprise since it didn't come out chunky and thick - on the contrary it's super smooth and presents like a broth. Even though we are drinking something that isn't pureed, all the flavours are present and it was excellent. The entree was HEAVEN. The table beside us ordered the same dish and devoured everything, leaving only bits behind. This is SERIOUSLY one of the best pastas I've had (the bolognese, which I don't see on the menu anymore!). Super moist pasta (not to mention smooth and thin), sauce is on point, the meat was super yummy, and it was damn filling. I can't describe to you how amazing this dish was. Go ahead, order it and disagree with me. I was quite worried that the dessert would disappoint but holy cow it surpassed my expectations. The crunchiness of the apple crumble - YES! Most Winterlicious meals leave me regretting I ever spent $45 or whatever but Nota Bene won me over. My boyfriend's dishes weren't bad as well but I think I ordered the winning combination."}
{"text":"We went here for winterlicious. The ambience was good as well as the service. I had the duck salad which was a good portion. It had shredded duck and mint in a tossed slaw. For the main course, i had the lamb shank. It was nice and tender but i wasn't too crazy about the cinnamon undertone. For dessert i had the sticky toffee pudding and you can't go wrong with that. For $53, it was a good deal to experience the restaurant with the company of friends. I left confused though as to what kind of restaurant this is as the food, though good, seemed like a mish mash."}
{"text":"We had a group of 25 at 2 long tables. The service was excellent, servers being careful to keep our water glasses full as well as the wine! Everyone served in groups of 6-8 simultaneously. Crispy duck salad superb as was the bread. I had Mediterranean sea bass which was perfectly cooked. The baked fruit and ice cream at desert also nicely done. Everyone agreed dinner was very good to excellent, including cod and steak. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Arrived late to see the ballet so we took our chances on an entirely new place. The service was quick being that we had 45 minutes in total to order and eat. Ordered the lobster salad and charcuterie board. Slim pickings on both. The salad came on a regular dinner plate with a thin layer of greens and the lobster. I understand seafood is expensive but why be so stingy on the greens and for $29?! The charcuterie board was lacking ..a few choice slices that had fancy names but to me seemed like salami and prosciutto and no cheese on the board. We weren't told there were two menus so I missed the casual menu that had prices that were more in line with what I was willing to spend for a quick meal. Decor was nice, so was our waitress but I'm left feeling totally reemed  (and still hungry) $90 later. Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"I must say these guys are very attentive to the customers requirements.  Been to a few other restaurants in Toronto already like Canoe, Keg Mansion, etc... and I must say Nota Bene has been a best experience so far.

Halibut here is a must try, the lobster and the steak are good too.  The prices are very reasonable for the kind of food and service you get here... If you are looking for a place to go to on weekends, try Nota Bene... I promise you will love it here.  Overall, its been a great experience, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Yum.  Yum.  Yummmmmmmm!

We had reservations for 6:30pm and were seated right away.  The wine list would have made my eyes cross if I had opened it.  Seeing the obvious dilemma, a server wandered over with a host of recommendations based on our vague wine likes and dislikes.  The result was an OK choice for me - not bad though.  

For starters, we shared the hamachi ceviche (with avocado!) which fairly danced on my tongue.  I followed with the scallops which were oh-so-juicy and deliciously seared.  The most fun part of the meal was the 7-cheese plate which was served with an incredibly fragrant honey and crispy toasted things which the server refilled a few times because we kept eating them all.  Seeing the obvious delight with this last 'plate', the server ventured into our conversation to re-educate us about the cheeses and his personal favourites.  Nice to know that they've tasted and liked what they serve.  To reiterate - yum, yum, yum! 

On top of the wine, we had ordered two other drinks on separate occasions, only one of which arrived.  Not seeing the second drink after over 20 minutes, the order was cancelled.  Not a huge deal as I wasn't in a cranky mood, but curious-making all the same.  As a personal preference, I felt the restaurant space was a bit big and the noise level a bit high.  It looks very nice though and given the level of service and quality of the food, I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I came here nearly 3 years ago while living in Toronto and to this day, I am still dreaming of my return!! Probably one of the top 5 restaurants I've ever dined at in my life! The food was absolutely to die for - the presentation, combination of ingredients, flavours, and texture combinations were absolutely flawless.  Each plate is a beautiful tasty and aesthetic composition as the chefs certainly prove that cooking is a true form of art!  If you are a foodie like myself, I highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"It's a very nicely decorated stylish restaurant with very classy touch to it. Although it is rather expensive it is quite full on a regular night. Food is delicious."}
{"text":"Perfect. Totally perfect.

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and it's my new favourite restaurant in Toronto. Sorry, Rushton! I had made reservations at Mark McEwan's new restaurant, Fabbrica, but on the morning of the birthday became troubled by the deeply mixed reviews. I switched to Nota Bene at the last minute, and am so glad I did. They have everything all figured out.

I had made a reservation, which we were late for. I called to put it back and the hostesses were lovely about it and would accept no apologies when we arrived. The space is stunning. And huge. I was shocked at how much clean, contemporary, perfectly lit space was hiding behind that tiny little Queen and John facade. It's a beautiful place to have a long, quiet meal.

They have free corkage after 9, which we took advantage of. They took the bottle away from us while we had our cocktails, and brought it back at just the right moment. It had been decanted and allowed to air out just the right amount. I was nervous to bring it in and expected, perhaps, a bit of attitude about it or an up-sell on other things to make up for it - it didn't happen.

We were initially seated beside a group of four, with two drunk women that were simply screaming laughter. It was absolutely impossible to have any sort of conversation. We asked our server to re-seat us, stressing he had already begun to provide us with lovely service and did not want him to lose the table. He wasn't willing to be worried about that, but did remain our server in the end. The staff seemed to sense we were trying to have a quiet, intimate meal and ended up seating us in a completely empty area of the restaurant which we both recognized as a closed section. This was incredibly kind.

We saw lots of large groups having long, enjoyable, boozy meals. Everyone looked happy.

Salted cod appetizer was stunning to my palette. I could have eaten 3 servings. Just stunning. I had the Cavatelli with truffle oil and mushrooms, my boyfriend had the hangar steak - not one of the \"expensive ones.\" Both were amazing - if this is the \"cheap steak,\" well... I don't know what to say. We had some sticky-toffee pudding for dessert, which was to die for, and they brought our a large piece of dark chocolate with \"Happy Birthday\" piped in white. Nice touch.

We were the very last people in the restaurant but were admonished not to rush even a tiny bit.

Worth every penny and perfect end-to-end. GO!!"}
{"text":"OK food, decent ambience and location. Service was good. But highly overrated... would come back only for lunch and their steak/beef tartare. Had just about everything else and it was highly forgettable."}
{"text":"*3-1/2 stars*

It amazes me how the same restaurant can yield 2 different experiences.  My first experience at Nota Bene was a little disappointing.  Although they used high quality ingredients, I didn't think the food was anything special.  But cue the namesake Suckling Pig & Bouding Noir Tart that has made Chef David Lee famous - and the result is phenomenal.

The restaurant was quite busy when I arrived, and without a reservation we were only able to nab a table at the front of the house.  Lucky for us, it was a window seat.  The crowd in here is a little older, and is a mix of the business and pre-show opera crowd.  It isn't what I would call a casual dining restaurant as I spotted a lot of fancy dresses and dapper business suits.

While waiting, I sipped on a Muy Thai cocktail which was a drink for the senses.  With lemon grass, red chillies, a splash of coconut, and basil leaves - there were many different flavours that came together in this seemingly simple, yet complex drink.  It may just be one of the best cocktails I've had in Toronto.  It is subtly sweet with a smooth coconut taste.  Just as the mellowness of the coconut hits your tongue, the red chillies slowly make their way to the tip of your tongue to spice things up again.  This is definitely a cocktail that is meant for slow sipping for the flavours to seep in.

We opted to skip on appetizers since the complimentary  bread basket tided us over and head straight for the mains.  My mission this time was to try the limited-time-only Suckling Pig & Boudin Noir Tart (available until February 9).  For your information, Boudin Noir refers to a type of blood sausage that is almost black in colour composed mainly of pork and pig's blood.  The tart was extremely rich in flavour and is something that should be shared.  Although generally speaking there were many different components to this dish - the sauce was so rich that it turned this into what I would call a melting pot dish (e.g.  everything tasted like the sauce).  Texturally, this was an interesting dish.  A puff pastry serves as the base of the tart, which loses its textural uniqueness with the sauce drenched all over and therefore losing the buttery, flaky texture.  The tart itself is composed of crispy pork rinds, portabello mushrooms, tender pieces of pork, the Boudin Noir, thin slices of bacon and truffle vinaigrette.  While I appreciate that this was a very rich and savory dish, I kind of wanted to be able to taste the distinct components that came together to tantalize the taste buds versus just having the same taste which came from the sauce in every bite.  The slices of bacon were translucent in appearance and just melted in your mouth as was the pieces of juicy and tender pork.  The blood sausage had an almost liver-like taste to it and was unique.  The pork rinds were perhaps the only textural contrast in the dish as it steered away from being \"soft\" like the rest of the components in the dish.  All in all, despite the lack in textures, the dish was savory.

My favourite pasta is Pappardelle (which is basically a broader fettuccine), particularly the egg variety.  Eggs just make everything smoother and better!  Tonight's pappardelle would be a Rabbit Sofrito.  Sofrito, refers to a blend of \"...aromatic ingredients [which have been] cut in very small pieces, and slowly sauteed or braised in cooking oil for 15-30 minutes.\" [1]  Rabbit, to me, can be described as having a more tender texture than chicken.  The sofrito consisted of ground up meet and a rich sauce and was no doubt, heavily lubed up from either cooking oil or butter.  This is probably one of the better dishes I've had at a restaurant.  The pasta was fresh and delicious.

I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but the most disappointing part of the evening was dessert.  I still can't believe I said that because those of you who know me, know that I love dessert!  Last time I opted for the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was way too sweet.  This time, at the recommendation of our server, we ordered the Apple Galette.  It was served with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream and a Blueberry Sauce.  I found the pastry shell to be too hard.  It was not buttery in taste, and was probably not made the same day.  The filling was the best part, although you don't have to be a culinary genius to make a good pie filling.

Verdict:

I've now had 2 dining experiences at Nota Bene, one good and one so-so.  With cocktails priced with an average price tag of $15, Nota Bene is definitely not an everyday indulgence.  I applaud Chef David Lee for crafting the Suckling Pig & Boudin Noir Tart as I don't think I've ever had anything quite like it in my dining experiences.  However, I think their desserts still need a bit of work.

This is a great place to go pre-theatre or for a special occasion.  Our bill rang in at around $103 before tax and tip."}
{"text":"If only yelp could incorporate half stars somehow, this would be a solid 3.5.  If it weren't for all the hype surrounding this place, maybe it would've gotten a higher rating, but overall I was expecting more, something orgasmically wowing that would draw me back.

As I walked into the dining room, it felt like I was in a scene of American Psycho with all the business suits and swarmy corporate types.  It felt like  everyone was trying to show off their business cards or the fake tits they bought their wives/girlfriends/secretaries.  Now I have nothing against Valentino suits or fake tits, just sayin' the atmosphere didn't feel very warm, especially for under 40 somethings.

Anyways, on to the food.

For starters we got the grilled Tunisian Grilled Octopus which was very, very well prepared.  Tender meat with an excellent spicy seasoning while avoiding the chewiness we're so used to from eating our tentacled friends.   Along with that, we ordered the Hot and Sour soup, and I was very surprised at how light it was.  The flavours were strong with a good balance between acid and heat.  A nice way to start the meal in the middle of winter.

Now, I'm a sucker for anything with a poached egg ontop, so I knew I would be getting the Wagyu Bunless Beef Burger for my main as soon as I saw it.  My gf got the Parpadelle and we also got an order of Onion Rings to share.  The menu to me was a bit small, and if I didn't know I was getting th burger, I'd be hemming and hawwing trying to decide what to eat 'cuz nothing really jumped out to me as a must have.

The burger meat itself was pillowy soft and had a decent flavour.  Couldn't really taste the truffles and they didn't add too much to the dish except make it more expensive =(.  Unfortunately, the egg wasn't cooked properly and was way too runny.  I usually look for a pudding like consistency with my poached eggs and this wasn't even close.

The parpadelle was very underwhelming.  Tasty but there was absolutely nothing special about it. In fact, I barely remember what it looked/tasted like.  Completely unnecessary were the Onion Rings - we barely touched them.  Not 'cuz they weren't good, they just weren't good enough for us to waste any more precious stomach space on.

Unsatisfied with our main course we ordered a 3 cheese plate and their Sticky Toffee Pudding.  Both of these were exceptional, and probably the best part of our entire meal.  The toffee was thick and sickly sweet, sharply contrasting the delicious flavours of the ice cream, going extremely well with my cup of coffee.  Our waitress was very friendly and took the time to explain each of the cheese and had a certain confidence to her that was very appealing.  A lot of the time I find people talking about cheese with an air of pretension and phoniness and take whatever they say with a grain of salt.  Not her though, she was fantastic.

Overall it was a pleasant meal with mixed feelings.  I definitely left the restaurant disappointed.  I was expecting just expecting more I suppose.  Is that even fair?  It was good, just not great.

Maybe that's why this review has taken me more than a week to complete.  Nothing special to write about."}
{"text":"Came in to check out the scene w a guy to sit at the bar & have a deep conversation. Comfortable bar stools, frothy cappuccino $5.85. The bartenders were attentive but not annoying asking if we wanted a drink every 5 mins which was classy. Also liked that they let us kiss at the bar without any issue. 
Bathroom was exquisite but a bit hard to find. 
Loved the ambience. Decor & lights were unique & added contemporary edge. 
Resto looks posh. Patrons dressed up. Possibly after opera dinner spot. 
I didn't check out the menu, but the place was packed so probably worth a try."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday party last night. Despite our table of 8 plus a table of 10 beside us, the restaurant was half empty at 8:30 PM which is a strange sign on a Saturday night during holiday season.

Service - attentive, friendly and quick.

Food - I had the tuna ceviche. Four decent slices drowning in a citrus coconut milk marinade with accompanying wonton crackers. Too acidic and flavourless for my liking. The birthday girl ordered melt-off-the-bone short ribs with two measly potato agnolotti for an astonishing $46!! We brought in our own birthday cake but charged $5 PER PERSON for plating fee so without needing a calculator, it cost $40 to cut and serve a cake. Ridiculous.

Nota Bene was on my restaurant bucket list but there are better fine dining options with less astronomical prices."}
{"text":"Ate here recently because of the mostly consistently good Yelp reviews. My meal definitely exceeded my expectations. The Yucatan hot and sour soup was delicious, and the pulled pork tostada was one of the best I've ever had -- moist, fresh, with a perfectly crispy tostada underneath. And the meal ended with great chocolate cake. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Nice classy environment. It was my first time here and sat in the bar/lounge which is kind of separated from the dining area. We tried their NB bar menu which consisted of snacks. Some notable mentions - beef slider, tourtière, sashimi, maitake mushroom. Also had the duck taco but was was really dry and I didn't even finish it - tasted gross. Overall, environment was good, but food was alright."}
{"text":"I went out to dinner here for my birthday and I thought it was quite good.

The interior is just gorgeous with large paintings on the walls and big tables. It's quite an open and large space that gets very loud. I was actually surprised to see just how huge the restaurant is, as I have walked by many a time and thought it was just a long, dark narrow resto lounge. 

We had the rabbit with pappardelle pasta and it was the first time I had ever tried rabbit. I was surprised at how tender it was and the pappardelle was delicious. We also had the chicken, which came with mashed potatoes and requested side orders of rapini. Portion sizes are quite small, but presentation and quality make up for it. 

For dessert, I had the chocolate cake and it was warm, moist and came with ice-cream. I was also pleasantly surprised when the friendly server brought out a candle and a piece of chocolate, which read 'Happy Birthday'. It was an unexpected, small gesture, which was appreciated. 

Overall, it was a memorable experience. Reservations are definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Finally made it in here last night with a group of fellow foodies and we all enjoyed our meals immensely. We sat in the main dining room, a modern, sleek space that came off as a little too sterile and corporate. The colourful paintings on the walls helped to warm the space up a bit though and our server was an extremely professional fellow who was generous in his time and opinions regarding the highlights of the menu. Plus the fact that no one batted an eye as I strode up to the table in neon birkenstocks is a plus. A major plus!

Anywhoo. The food was excellent and up to par as expected. We enjoyed the crispy duck slaw, tuna tartare as starters (both had such vibrant bright flavours) and a couple members of the group had the charcuterie board. I was lucky enough to savour a few bites off this gold mine and it's definitely one of the better boards in town: crispy pork jowl, lonza, chorizo, maple cured bacon and duck proscuitto. I'll be coming back to sample the whole hog another time for sure! Aside: one brave member of the group actually had the charcuterie board to start and the boudin noir tart to follow-all in the name of gourmet research of course. :)

I ordered the stilton brisket burger to start and it was a beefy, juicy creation saddled in on a brioche bun. This was a hefty, meaty burger which I enjoyed though not as much as Harbord Room's burger which I consider to be more flavourful.  

Dessert was a cherry crumble for me, a simple thing but very comforting end to a fabulous meal. Someone else was lucky enough to order the sorbets paired up with fruit and I think she had the luck of the draw; that passionfruit sorbet was most refreshing and exquisite. I am still thinking about it today!

I'll be back for sure, Nota Bene does many things well even if the dining room feels a bit disjointed and hyped up with corporate eau. It's very pricey but it's worth it whether you're aiming to impress, celebrate or immensely enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"Had not been here in a few years. Needed a nice restaurant on short notice for a business dinner for 5 at a reasonable time. They were able to accomdate.

My experience left me wondering why I do not come here more often.

Nice room with enough privacy to have a good conversation. 

Overall the food was very good.  With a group of 5 I am not going to recount everything we ate and drank. I could not fo it from memory and looking at the bill again would not be pleasant.

Two two things stand out from memory.The duck salad was a real winner and the halibut was fine portion wise but quite overcooked.

Service was quick, accurate, attentive and friendly.

This was a hot trendy place a few years back but they're still here and a reliable choice."}
{"text":"The food was quite good but it's ridiculously expensive.  Full of people who looked like they were there to see and be seen and to flaunt their wealth.  Not my kind of place.  Had a much better experience at The Grove the night before."}
{"text":"You gonna love this place!! It's super classy and the food is just amazing! I got the crispy duck salad for starter, the dressing is little spicy to my liking but the duck is perfectly marinated and crispy tender. For main I had the Saturday special halibut. It's so fresh and perfectly cooked! It's severed with rapini which has a bitter taste (our waiter reminded us that some ppl don't like it). Their specials change every week anyway best to check on their website ahead of time. For desert, just get the sticky toffee ice cream it won't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Had summerlicious lunch. Very disappointed. Menu is not well designed. Main courses include two salads, one vegetarian pasta and one Asian noodle with mince pork. Doesn't even include a meat main course. Strawberry shortcake is just icecream on top of a layer of cake with strawberry jam and frozen strawberries. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Friend loves it

I liked it but not sure it's a favorite for me

Friend had veal, I had pasta

Food was good, nice wine selection,  price not bad, menu decent, service was good"}
{"text":"New Canadian restaurant conveniently located on the corner of University and Queen.

Service: I thought our hostess and servers that day were super friendly and welcoming for a more upscale restaurant so kudos!

Duck salad: A substantial amount of duck and duck skin paired with julienne vegetables and lettuce. Can't complain about this dish. The duck skin was fatty and crispy, while the dressing added a nice kick. Favourite dish of the meal!

Arctic char filet: This dish was a bi confusing to me. The salmon sits on top of a bed of cooked vegetables swimming in a coconut milk and lemongrass soup/sauce (?). Although interesting, I don't think the sauce complimented the salmon very well.

Strawberry trifle: I love the fluffiness of the cream on this dessert. I also love the added crunch from the crushed cookie bits.

Not a bad spot at all! I would be happy to come back again to try other mains!"}
{"text":"I went at 2pm on a Friday and they were open. I think the Yelp hours are wrong. I ate the prosciutto and arugula salad. It was about $18. Delicious, fresh, and light. They had a wide selection of wine. Most specialty cocktails had run and whiskey. The staff was prompt and polite."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try Nota Bene (we'd heard nothing but great things), and so we arrived for a relatively early mid-week dinner.

The place was already 80% full, and I think we were extremely lucky to have gotten seated with no wait.

We were extremely relieved to have remembered to dress up a bit, because EVERYONE seemed to be in formal wear (and there was no event happening, people were all just really dressed up), so be forewarned, unless you like sticking out like a sore thumb.

The food was incredible.  We started with the imported-from-Italy-that-morning warm Burrata with Prosciutto (I will never have burrata any other way, the cream inside had melted into a heavenly near-butter that I would gladly mainline until I died of heart failure).  We split a Crispy Duck Salad (a bit light on both the duck and the salad, but we really just wanted to try it for the experience, and it didn't disappoint).  For entrees, we had the Rabbit Soffrito with Pappardelle (warming and savoury), and the Braised Beef Short Ribs (requisitely tender with a complex flavour profile).  For sides (we weren't sure how large the entrees were going to be so we chanced adding some since we were hungry), we had an order of Frites and Rapini (so glad we did, both were delicious dishes in their own right).  And finally, for dessert, we split the Mixed Berry Bowl with Sugar Cookie (mostly because we were curious about the cookie, which was exactly what we were hoping for - a thin wafer of crispy, crispy sweetness).

We will definitely be back, but it's high dining with matching prices, and TO has no dearth of great dining at all price points."}
{"text":"A good experience...this is an efficient and well run restaurant. It delivers good food and as has a balanced wine list. 
The appetizers we selected were the Novia Scotia Lobster salad and the Duck salad and they were good. And the two Entrees we had were the Sea Bass and the lamb - tasty and well presented. We had sides of brussel sprouts which were delightful; the onion rings had just a little too much batter for our liking. 
We enjoyed a Clos Village Pinot Noir which was drinking well.
There were times that one felt like it was a business you were eating in not a restaurant, and the 'foodie' experience suffered a little."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Great drinks and cocktails: I had the Gin and Tonic (Fever Tree & Botanist) and my partner ordered the Dark and Smokey (Smoked Marker's Mark, maple syrup, bitters, ginger beer, lime).  Both tasted fantastic, though a bit pricey ($17 for the former, $15 for the latter).  

- Our starters were pretty good.  I had the Hamachi Ceviche which was tasty and decently sized.  The Duck Salad was actually decently sized for a starter and pretty hearty.  Neither dishes were mind-blowing but we were pretty happy with them.

- The Sticky toffee pudding stands out as the highlight of the meal.  It was very tasty and a great way to end the meal.

Cons:
- Ambiance: pretty noisy - the room was open with a light interior.  There were a couple of babies/toddlers with iPads and then there were people who started playing musical chairs for group photos.  It wasn't really the low-key feel that I was hoping for. 

- The Price:Taste Ratio (PTR) is a bit high.  My partner had the Perth County Beef Tenderloin ($37) and I had the rosemary and garlic roasted veal chop ($49).  Both cuts of meat were cooked well and the quality was great but the flavour didn't leave much 
 

tl;dr - pricey, so-so ambiance.  Great drinks, average meals."}
{"text":"Firstly, Nota Bene's ambiance and decor is perfect. The restaurant is aesthetically gorgeous and well-designed without being over the top. Then there's the mouthwatering food and drinks. Highly recco: SOUS-VIDE PORK CHEEK, QUÉBEC BOILEAU VENISON (chili rojo mushrooms, Kabocha squash, Brussels sprouts, jackfruit, hazelnuts), CRISP DUCK SALAD (sumac-dusted green papaya slaw, kaffir lime, coriander, taro root), and B.C. BLACK COD (dashi & wild Matsutake mushroom broth, taro root). The Melange cocktail with walnut bitters, was what our waiter described as \"Spirit Forward\" and worthy of a few rounds."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic experience with my partner in crime.  Had the osso bucco and it was just fall-off-the-bone-melt-in-your-mouth-meaty-delciousness.

The servers were extremely polite and knowledgeable of the dinner menu, the ambiance was just spot on and felt very private despite having an open space.

I'd go back here if I had a special occasion to have or had a few extra \"Borden's\" in my budget to eat here."}
{"text":"Ordered the rabbit parpadelle and it was delicious. So juicy and flavorful. Death row /last meal worthy. Nice wine and beer selection and everything is served in Schott Zwiesel glasses. Had the chocolate brownie for desert which was average. For $12 I don't recommend.  Service not amazing.  Should be a little more attentive to patrons rather than watching TV in bar."}
{"text":"Super disappointment   Food was very mediocre ad service was alright. Hamachi ceviche was so small, steak tartar was over seasoned, bass was not acceptable and hanger steak was better then the rest  Not going back anytime soon. Chocolate Molton cake was good."}
{"text":"Great fine dining social place. I love the atmosphere, however I found the staff not as pleasant. None the less, the food was great. I tried the Quebec Boileau venison, every time a restaurant has venison I tend to order it as it is rare. It melted in your mouth I loved it. Would order it again. I found the sides to be alright. I also ordered the shaved onion rings on the side. Very different and the horseradish crema dill complimented the dish very well. Would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to Nota Bene for a celebratory dinner because of great recommendations from friends. I was not disappointed.

We were greeted by our fantastic server, Bonnie, who told us about the specials for the night and filled our glasses with water immediately.

I ordered:
- Tuna tartare
- Hangar steak
- Sticky toffee pudding

My girlfriend ordered:
- Crisp duck salad
- Hangar steak
- Molten chocolate cake

The food was phenomenal, and you really could not have asked for a better meal. Our server was very attentive, and even had a slab of chocolate sent to our table that said \"Congratulations!\"

I was absolutely thrilled to eat at Nota Bene, and I would not hesitate to go back and let my friends all know about my great experience there. If anyone on the Nota Bene staff happens to read this, please give my warmest regards to Bonnie, she's an amazing server."}
{"text":"Came here for my GF birthday on a Wednesday... 

We had the tuna sashimi, and octopus to start and we both followed that with the grilled tuna as a main, followed by the chocolate cake and the peach cobbler... couple of glasses of champagne... 

the starters were great, the sauce the tuna came on was excellent Asian inspired flavour and the octopus was more of Mediterranean version... both done exceptionally well...

mains were solid and tasty nothing too complicated... the kitchen also brought us an order of chantrelles and rappini comp'd which was really nice too... 

deserts were only okay... the chocolate lava cake is somewhat over done these days so even when its excellent (which it was) its never that OMG worthy... peach cobbler was nice and simple...

it might seem that im a little underwhelmed by the food but that's not the case... its just cause we've been here a bunch and the food is always very good and CONSISTANT! something you don't see too much of in the city... and more than that the service is excellent...polished and friendly/attentive... great for a nice night out or a special occasion!"}
{"text":"As far as upscale restaurants go, this one was didn't disappoint. The ambiance was pleasant, and the food delicious.

In regards to specific things on the menu... the crispy duck salad was great as were the tuna steaks. The sticky pudding for desert was great too, but better if shared between two.

Wine is pricey. You won't find a glass for less than $11 on the list, but at least most of the entrees are between $23-30. Expect a dinner for 2 to run about $110-140.

They offer coat check but I have no idea if its a free service."}
{"text":"I went for a business dinner and we were pleasantly surprised with the good food.  The brussel sprouts were sooo good!"}
{"text":"$4 bar snacks from 4-7pm!! 

Last year Nota Bene launched their 4-7 bar snacks menu.  I was surprised that there wasn't many people at all at the bar on a Friday night. Its a great place to come to enjoy good food, without the financial district crowds. 

The service here really stood out for me, staff was so personable, friendly, and accommodating. We ordered 2 sliders, they accidentally gave us 4, and didn't charge us extra. We also ordered the calamari and codd fritter. Nothing about the food really blew me away, but regardless it was yummy and very well-presented. 

Overall verdict: Great experience here, come for the ambiance, service, and $4 bar snacks!!"}
{"text":"Had to entertain some bigshot partner here who repeatedly referred to ICBC as \"ick bick.\" Pretended to laugh at this jokes, even though they were about as funny as pancreatic cancer. Food was surprisingly good given the shitass company I had. Had the duck salad and steak. Medium rare."}
{"text":"I have been to Nata Bene a few times and I finally decide to write a review.

The owner / chef is David Lee who was previously owner/chef of Spledido, a restaurant David Lee bought from the owner at a young age of 29.  

I have always enjoyed the food and service at nota bene.  Most main dishes are at the $20's range and i think it's a steal if you compare it to the dishes and service provided by some other franchise \"cool\" restaurants like moxies.   

I like how David Lee always put an Asian twist on western food. (more so than Susur Lee and I think he adds too much asian)  Personally, i really enjoy the black cod and French classic Beef bourguignon with a modern twist.  Most north american will probably find the hanger steak too \"chewy\".  Once a year, Nota Bene will serve Porchetta on Tuesday and I highly recommend anyone to check it out.

Don't forget to order their appetizers as I really think the appetizers are the \"Main\" star at Nota Bene.   Personal favorite is the pulled pork taco.

PS - If you feel a little Spanish, I'd recommend going to Nota Bene after 9pm - corkage is FREE!"}
{"text":"... $22 BURGER ??? ...

I'm NOT a burger person, but I'm all for a great time with my fellow Yelpers! Plus, this UYE was organized by the fabulous Natalie T., so I was stoked! Thanks Nat!!!

I was here before, and 4 years later, still recall wanting to come back! The restaurant has really held it's own! The interior looks as exquisite as I recall it back in the day of it's grand opening week! Sleek & ultra modern, with a refined ambiance.

The yelp! crew came here for mainly one thing:

... $22 burgers ...

When the burgers arrived, (Jennifer's Stilton Brisket Beef Burger), it was quite the grand entrance! We ordered about 8 burgers at our table of 16, so when the burgers were served, there was an army of waiters that marched in single file, each waiter carrying a burger on a serving plate, carried with pride. I felt like we were at a banquet hall! What service!

The burger itself was not as big as I had anticipated! But the patty was at lease 3\" thick! It was served with large slices of blue cheese (which you could substitute for other cheeses, like Brie). Booooo! I didn't know this and got Blue Cheese - which I am not a fan. The taste of the blue cheese in my burger was too sharp for my liking. I added some onion rings between the buns to add some flare!

The burger buns were soft and semi-sweet, the meat was thick, juicy, and filling. I wasn't hungry, but I ate the whole thing by myself, (I have a big appetite), and it was satisfying. Half of the crew shared the burger, or ate half, and were STUFFED. For the whopping price, I suggest you try sharing first and order more if you really like it!

As a non-fan of burgers, sadly, it did not convert me, but it was tasty and definitely worth trying once! We also ordered the pecan tart & buttermilk icecream and sampled the creme brûlée. The tart was much too rich & too sweet, especially after polishing off a heavy burger! The creme brûlée was creamy and soft and light! That's my style!

Overall, the food quality & service were impeccable!  I believe you should always try new things that have been raved about, at least once! Or you will never know! And what's more, I have now had two great and memorable dining experiences here!

{"text":"I went to this restaurant with some friends but sat at the bar. The restaurant is connected to an office building and some of my friends had difficulty finding the door as it appeared to previously have lots of doors.

They wanted to take advantage of the happy hour specials but when I got there, they said that they only had happy hour during the summer when it is slow for the restaurant. The reason for the summer special is that they do not have a patio and thus, needed a gimmick to attract people into the restaurant during those few months. Since fall is here, the business has returned to normal with their regular clientele.

My friends and I ended up sitting at the bar ordering a few drinks and apps. The tuna tartar was amazing with crackers which we ended up ordering more. The service from bartender was amazing as he was knowledgeable with the drinks as well as the food menu. It is on the pricey side for those looking for happy hour deals. However, the overall experience was good."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I have to say it's always a hit and miss with the food, but ambience and service is always superb. 
I came here on a Thursday after the ballet. This is a great spot for dinner before or after a show at the four season performing arts centre. 
We had an order of the onion rings to share. They were crispy and well presented but it was a little too tangy for my liking. The flavour wasn't balanced well. I ordered the Newfoundland lobster with rapini ravioli. It was just ok. A little too salty and drenched in way too much butter for me."}
{"text":"i went to this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation and fully enjoyed my meal. We had the duck salad and steak tartar to start followed by boudin noire and suckling pig with an order of onion rings. The only thing I can only complain about was the duck salad, personally I thought it was nothing special, although the duck was perfectly cooked. Order the onion rings to share, they are amazing (best ever) and plentiful.

The suckling pig and boudin noir is a house speciality and I bare witness to its quality. The pig was absolutely amazing and probably some of the best pork I've had. The steak tartar was also great and definitely the best Iv'e had in Toronto so far. In addition to the good food, the wine list is extensive although pricey. We had the Bin 76 Pinot Noir and it was great.

So would I recommend this place? Definitely. Would I go back? Not anytime soon, the food was great but nothing that pulls me in, many more place I have to try yet!"}
{"text":"been here on several occasions - winterlicious, hangout with friends etc. 

so the verdict: winterlicious was not bad. I had duck salad (which was really the best thing on the menu), main was lamb i believe - it's alright. and then i had the cheese board.

fancy stuff, expensive. not phenonmenal."}
{"text":"After our dinner on Saturday night, four people who dine out often, asked and answered the same question with the same response; would you come back. , The answer was a resounding NO.  The service was excellent, but the food was uninspired. Considering the prices being charged, it should be excellent, not ordinary."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Our server was very attentive. The food are amazing on how they paires with their sauce and spices. Amazing fusion"}
{"text":"Perfect pre-theater restaurant for the ballet at the Four Seasons Performance Center diagonally across the intersection.  Previously here, I was wondering why the heck they were so darn fast with the food and obviously it's because they're trained to cater to the speed level of the pre-show crowd.  We only had about 50 minutes to eat but the staff (even in the bar area, which is by the windows like I prefer) was on top of delivery and filling every glass of wine and water at exactly the right moment.  They were very accommodating with returning for desert later post-show.

We enjoyed the wine, served in glassed tapering tightly to a small opening for the Pinot Noir, though a bit expensive per glass effectively doubling the bill.  It was nice to have a several varietals by the glass.  The Tom Yum soup version with lobster I had again and still enjoy it's refreshing simplicity and herbs.   The cod was one of the better fish I've had in the city and the coarse grounds of kosher salt evenly distributed to great effect. I had but a taste of a very well done hummus that accompanied it.   

I still probably wouldn't come here out of my way but for a pre-show or another event in this section of downtown, it's on my short-list."}
{"text":"Came in here for Summerlicious! I really enjoyed each meal - I particularly enjoyed my lobster bisque. Staff were pretty accommodating. They were a bit forgetful at times (they forgot to bring us balsamic vinegar and they took a while to get our bills) but the tasty food and welcoming ambiance of the restaurant made up for this."}
{"text":"My family went there for Winterlicious and I could not have been more pleased with the meal and service. We had the crab salad, crispy duck salad and foe gras for starters. We also had a side of onion rings, potato frites and brussel sprouts. We had the Haddock and Lamb shanks for the main entrees. All cooked to perfection. For dessert we had sorbet and sticky toffee bread. Impeccable delivery and presentation with inspired and strong flavours. Everything worked well and the meal was just simply delicious. The ambiance was calm and inviting and the service was comforting and efficient. I simply can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"It was pretty, and the onion rings were good. I was seriously regretting the sea bass an hour later, though."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner a few weeks ago.  I was with a large group and I forgot to take notes, so this review will not be as detailed as usual.

The crispy duck salad was okay: there was not enough crispiness to make it exciting, nor enough flavor.

The steak tartar was also okay, but it felt a little heavy.

The pistachio ice-cream did not particularly taste like pistachio, unless I really used my imagination: I found this annoying.

Maybe I ordered the wrong things..."}
{"text":"nota bene is a solid establishment in: beautifully plated food, spacious interior with modern decor, attentive service, comparable pricing for similar dine-in experiences. Nothing mind-blowing but nothing here will be a let down (even during Summer/Winterlicious!). I quite like the dessert offerings here - flavours are delicate and subtle. We particularly enjoyed the ontario strawberry shortcake and the sorbet with coconut tapioca and kaffir lime leaf!"}
{"text":"It's a lovely space, great service but the food was just average for that price. Perhaps it was what I picked but here goes

Promegranite spritzer - nicely done. Lovely drink before the wine.

Duck prosciutto salad with black truffle - pretty good but not a knock out.

Main - scallops. Most disappointing part of my meal. The scallops didn't seem particularly fresh or well seasoned, the crispiness on the carmelization of the scallops was quickly doused by the soup the dish was served in and the carmelization didn't seem to add any flavours at all. 

Dessert - molten chocolate cake with peanut brittle ice cream. The ice cream lacked strong flavours which I was craving. Still dessert was probably my favourite part of the meal."}
{"text":"Im giving this 3/5 because while the overall food and service was good, the dinner was on the pricey side. We did the theatre menu (1 starter and 1 entree each), with 2 small glasses of wine, and split 1 dessert and it was over $160. Thats abit pricey for a quick dinner before a ballet. The food was good, tried the butternut squash soup, the harvest salad (both good but not 'wow' worthy). And for the entrees, had salmon and pasta. Both were good but not great. The salmon didnt really remind me that i was in an Italian restaurant. The warm chocolate cake was the best part of the dinner, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Had a really enjoyable meal here at the end of August with my hubby before heading out to the theater.  Have to say that Julien Vincent (sommelier) made our night because our server was awful!  Talk about snooty, he didnt mention the evenings specials, took about 15 minutes to bring a menu, even longer to come back and take our order and if we hadnt ended up chatting with Julien our evening would have been ruined.  Coming from CA we asked Julien to recommend some local wines, not only did he offer a great wine from Vineyard, he then wrote a long list of wineries we should visit the next day when we headed out to Niagara on the Lake.

Meal was very enjoyable, all three courses were great.  Just need to get the servers in shape!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, but used to frequent quite regularly a few years ago. I can't comment on its current state (just a disclaimer).

What I liked about this place is its location, decor, reasonable prices, variety and consistency of the food. It was always a good stand-by restaurant for when family or friends came into town. 

Loved all the appetizers from the crispy duck salad (amazing! so crispy and soft on the inside) to the hamachi to the steak tartare (the portion is huge on this one, I probably didn't even have to order a main). I liked the rabbit pappardelle and the chilean sea bass. I can't remember the other things I've had. But it was generally very good.

Would I return? Yes (but  looking at these reviews I would be wary)"}
{"text":"Note: This review is for 2017 Winterlicious and is probably not a reflection of their regular service and menu.

I had a very good experience at Nota Bene few years back and decided to come back for 2017 Winterlicious. Let's just say that the food is merely average. We tried: Foie Gras, Pork chop, and the banana pudding.

I can probably sums up our experience at Nota Bene as being just average. Nota Bene, along with many high end restaurants in the city, fail to appreciate that Winterlicious is a way to attract repeat customers not just to make a quick buck with \"$48\" and delivering subpar food. Alas, this is exactly what happened. 

The Foie Gras itself is decent, but the preparation is lacking of any imagination. It is being served with a biscuit, salad and some jelly. I would come to expect that there is at least some more thoughts being put into this dish. The pork chop is probably the most disappointing aspect being overcooked and chewy. 

The service is brisk, but nothing to rave about. 

Again, perhaps Nota Bene is a better restaurant during non Winterlicious days. However, for this occasion, it did not impress."}
{"text":"Just went back to Nota Bene last night and I can't get enough!

The service seems to have taken a leap forward, though it was already Top Shelf to begin with. We ordered the \"Farm To Fork Charcuterie\" to start, followed by the braised short rib and scallops to follow. All the dishes were presented beautifully with flair and charm. 

The stemware and flatware they employ is also quite lovely- it can make all the difference in the world I believe.

It still has the New York bustling atmosphere in the dining room and it's now becoming a bit if a local celeb-spot as evidenced last night.

NOTA BENE: Keeping local mouths happy since 2008. Magnificent!"}
{"text":"Wonderful ambience and absolutely delicious food."}
{"text":"First time at nota bene for lunch. A 5 minute walk from Osgoode station. The staff are very welcoming and very polite, even though our group did not arrive together. 

The salmon tataki and the thai beef salad was decently portioned and priced. Great taste - the salmon was seared well on the outside and wakame salad was dressed well. Beef was cooked perfectly with the slaw being on the slightly acidic side, but all together combined, it was the tasty bite of meat and veg.

I will be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I just haven't been impressed. I just don't really get all the rave reviews from Yelp and even magazines such as Toronto Life and Aeroplan. Now obviously I'm not saying it's the worst restaurant on the planet but I think the hype is larger then the end product.

The first time I came it was really disappointing. Now it's probably because I ordered the burger and I've had my share of burgers all around North America. But man it was awful. I believe the blue cheese had something to do with it. If you love blue cheese, then perhaps it won't be as awful. By the end of the night, I had spent quite a bit of money but didn't have much to show for it.

The second time I went, the experience was better. I don't quite remember what I ordered but I don't recall it being a standout experience. All I remember was that I still felt that this place is a bit overrated.

One thing that you can't knock Nota Bene about is its atmosphere. If you love a busy restaurant that has buzz, this is the place to be. Lots and lots of cool people there and everybody seems to be having a great time. Definitely makes you want to hang around a bit after the meal is done. However, I do recall the hostess being rather snooty. I don't know what it is with high-end restaurants in Toronto. Maybe it's that they can smell I'm poor or something. But man is it hard to not get somebody with attitude at Nota Bene. I guess it comes with the territory.

To summarize. Food is ok, not spectacular. Service is good except hostesses. Atmosphere is amazing. I'll probably go back just to give it another shot because of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for the tasting menu last night. We didn't have a reservation but we're able to get a table in the dining room. The hostess was very friendly and we were seated quickly. Service was a bit slow, but friendly. Our waiter was really nice and helped my boyfriend pick out a delicious and different gin and tonic. The stand out dishes for me were the cauliflower, which had a rich sauce and shavings of truffle, my main, the venison that was served with Brussels sprouts, and desert. I asked to change to the chocolate torte (the tasting menu comes with a lemon blueberry dish) and it wasn't a problem. The chef also sent out some oysters topped with caviar - also very delicious.
The tasting menu is an experience. It was a perfect evening with great food."}
{"text":"I've heard of Note Bene for sometime. Happy we finally decided to double date here. 

Service: Started off bad - actually ended bad as well - the waitress was super uninterested in us. I often wonder why unhappy people work at restaurants. If you don't like people, you're in the wrong business.

Food: 5 stars!
Hamachi Ceviche was delicious - very citrusy, just how I like it.
Steak Tartare - excellent!
Tuna tartare - tasteless - I'm a huge fan of tuna tartare and this one was my least fav.
Charcuterie - a serious platter, recommended
Entrees:
Scallops - I love scallops! and this dish was fantab
Wagyu Brisket Burger, pommes frittes with a truffle mayo - I'm a huge fan of anything truffle - this was the BEST mayo, would make a shoe taste fantastic! One damn good $44 dollar burger. Ok not worth $44 but if you split it with someone it's sure worth $22

5 stars for the food
-2 for the bad service"}
{"text":"When Food is great and service is practically non-existent, I can't justify giving anything more than A-OK. 

... I felt the need to share my experience with the General Manager (or the person who seemed to be in charge that night) through an email the next day. I just wanted him to acknowledge my email, nothing more but his lack of response made me feel that this establishment has a bit of an EGO and that they really don't care about their customers like I'd hope they would. See my experience below:

_________________________________________________________________
I thought our waiter throughout the evening was not engaging at all, not willing to serve throughout the night. When asking to see if he had a chiller for the bottle of wine we brought, it seemed like a hassle for him to do so. The only times I saw him at the table was
- When he took our order
- Came by to top up on our wine glasses twice
- Presented us with the dessert menus
- When the bill was presented to us

Never once did he check on our meal to see how things were going and I take service very seriously, especially when the food does not come cheap. When I had called the restaurant early that afternoon to see whether anything special was done for occasions, a hostess mentioned that regardless of whether dessert was ordered, a complimentary piece of chocolate was presented with a candle, which is a very thoughtful gesture.  Although the meal left us very full and we opted not to order dessert, this was forgotten (not that it was necessary).
_____________________________________________________________________

.... it really saddens me that someone behind the front of house is not supported by those who are at the front of house. The food was delicious. They split the duck salad in two, and the rabbit parpadelle was succulent and juicy. The short ribs had flavour and we had no complaints about the meal. But if I'm going to pay that type of money for food and service, I expect to get the full package. Maybe i should not have picked this place to celebrate my first wedding anniversary after all."}
{"text":"I came here first to try out the Summerlicious menu last year and liked it so much that I decided to return for the regular menu. One of the dishes I had was pork and it was simply amazing - I didn't know pork could taste that good. I also had some of their sashimi and it was very fresh and tasty. The service is the best - the servers were always there ready to help out but they weren't breathing down my neck."}
{"text":"Met a friend for a pre-Opera dinner last night and it was a pleasure from the start to the end. Greeting was warm and welcoming...I was early and got a martini ordered while waiting for my companion. 
Shortened pre-theater menu items were a nice mix and we stayed on track. Chilled zucchini soup was velvety and delicious, entrees were perfectly cooked and the dessert of lemon curd pavlova was sublime. Now if only the Opera was this good..."}
{"text":"I went there with my boyfriend for winterlicious. 
The food was so small portion.
My boyfriend had Cumbrae Farms Beef Bourguignon, he only got 5 pieces of the beef.
I had Rapini Ravioli , and there were only 5 pieces of the Ravioli as well.
The service was good.
We paid $145 in total, and not even half full.
I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"\"When David and Yannick left their posts at Splendido, all disciples worried that nothing could compare. Wasted worry.

Nota Bene opened in 2008 and is still catering to refined tastes of all varieties. The front of house is equaly marred in perfection as the belly of the beast (the kitchen of course).

Although I still maintain that David's kitchen gave birth to the best bread (second only to NY's Balthazar), they now offer patrons Thuet Bakery bread that is akin to many a boulangerie in France. Bread is key. You need not provide it, but if you do - nothing but the best please. If butter is love, bread is passion....\"

{"text":"April 11, 2015: Ordered a bottle of red wine that was brought too warm to the table. The waitress opened it anyways and when we complained about it she offered to put it on ice. Later she acknowledged that the bottle was indeed too warm. I just feel like that for the prices they charge they would take better care of their customers and NOT serve anything that they know is below their own standards."}
{"text":"Me and a couple of friends had tickets to the a TSO Concert and my friend suggested Nota Bene. I was so excited to come here after reading some of the yelp reviews and BlogTO. 
I was actually a bit more excited to leave half way though.

I do have to give the restaurant poitns for the food. I had gotten the Crisp Duck Salad (included sumac-dusted green papaya slaw, kaffir lime, coriander, and cashews for $15). It was a bit more on the pricey side, but hey it was worth every penny. I can taste it right now while writing this review. I've had many Vietnamese type slaw duck/chicken salads which is actually quite a rare dish to find in Vietnamese restaurants, but Nota Bene's is just out of the world. The crispyness of the duck perfectly compliments the papaya slaw and cashews. It was ..MMMMMM.

However the downsides of this was the experience. The waiters were friendly, however it seems like they would rather be serving someone else than me and my friend. It seemed like the waiter thought we were just a couple of young looking, student budget (and student tipping) teenagers and would rather serve any other table but ours. 

The ambience of the restaurant was also a bit stuffy. Also a bit too pricey for myself. I probably won't be coming here any time again soon."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and their lobster salad is a must try.  Totally recommend this place for their food!"}
{"text":"The only thing I liked about Note Bena is that I left completely stuffed since none of my friends ate anything they ordered and gave it all to me (clearly I'm less picky).  

I was pretty pissed when I realized we had to pay a fortune for all that junk, though.  

Frankly, the food was not good and the service was poor.  We gave up on the restaurant and went down the street for froyo for dessert.

I would not recommend at such high prices.  Go to any O&B restaurant instead."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, there aren't many options for me to choose from at Nota Bene.  I inquired ahead of time to make sure they had vegetarian options because on the menu online only listed meat or seafood mains. To be honest, I am not that interested in eating a salad or a basic veggie pasta for dinner if I make the effort to go out to a nice restaurant for a good meal. Why should I suffer or miss out on good food just because I choose to not eat meat? Anyway, so I inquired ahead and was offered a salad (pass), mushroom pasta (pass), a platter of steam veggies (boring!), or the chef can make a vegetable tart (sold!) and that tart was fab!

I ordered a mushroom salad ($17) to start. I believe it was chanterelle mushrooms or a mixture of that plus others on some mixed greens. It was a \"special of the day\" salad and I ordered it minus the meat.
For my main, I had the vegetable tart ($18). It had zucchini, tomato, roasted red peppers, cheese and sprinkles of truffles. This was simple and delicious. I would definitely come back and have this again if it is available.  For dessert, I had a passion fruit sorbet ($8.00) and a cup of mint tea. The sorbet was delightful. I love the little flowers they put in. 

Overall, it was a really enjoyable meal. Food was great, service was great, the only complaint I have about the restaurant is the fact that it was so hot and muggy when I was there. I think they must've left the AC off by mistake. Also, the restaurant was really noisy (think Beer Bistro level of noisy) so I felt like I had to yell just to talk to my friends.

That being said, I was really happy that they created a vegetarian tart off the menu for me and I hope this will eventually make it to the menu as a permanent item."}
{"text":"A very delayed review but came here for Summerlicious on July 21, 2016.  I got the following:
- SMOKED CHICKEN AND TORTILLA SOUP
- ZUCCHINI PERCIATELLI PASTA (VEGETARIAN)
- ONTARIO STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE (LOCAL)

For some reason, our waiter didn't give us bread (but the table next to us, also doing Summerlicious, got bread...).  The food was pretty decent, nothing amazing or special.  The pasta was very interesting since it was very thick noodles that reminded me of udon, but none of the dishes really blew my mind.  Suffice to say, this was the only Summerlicious meal I had throughout the promotion period so it was all right."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying if you haven't been here, book your table now! I really enjoyed my experience. My friend and I sat at the bar and ordered our drinks. The service and the food were amazing. 

I ordered the Beef Briskey Burger with Braised Beef on top w the Fries. The burger meat was so flavorful and great quality. Everything fit well together. My friend ordered the Pappardelle Pasta with pulled Québec rabbit, pancetta, and pecorino. It was very good. 

It is very expensive but in my opinion worth it! 

Keep Eating,

{"text":"A fabulous restaurant located fairly close to Four Seasons Theatre. It has an array of amazing dishes and an extensive wine list! We ordered many dishes to share and there was not a weak dish among them! Great service and quiet ambience."}
{"text":"Glad to see these guys drop a bit in the national resto rankings ... went here to celebrate a huge personal landmark.  Shared the news with the server.  Received mediocre service and overpriced food.

But at least the server did mutter a half-assed 'congratulations'.  

Coasting on reputation - many better places to eat on Queen or Baldwin, and many cost a lot less."}
{"text":"this place is all pomp and no circumstance.  Sure, its a pretty place to eat but the sommelier didnt know what he was talking about, we asked for a buttery white wine recommendation and we spent over 150 on a mineraly bottle of crap.  The lobster salad was horrible as was the crispy duck salad.. see pics i sent back the overcooked grouper and there was barely any crab in the crabcakes the rabbit parapadelle was decent but the saving grace was the desserts.  sticky toffee something and the chocolate brownie.  There are just so many other restaurants Id rather go to.. i will never go to nota bene again!"}
{"text":"Ooookay.  I was a little scared coming here as the menu on Yelp is not really super vegetarian friendly, but they definitely did have some options!  Came here with a large group of people for an after work meeting.

AMBIANCE:  Love the look of this place.  It was clean and well designed.  Not so loud, but still a fun place to dine.

STAFF:    My dad and I were late for the dinner because we walked.  The woman at the coat check very kind and cool.  Helped us get to our table.  Staff were very attentive and very knowledgeable about their menu.  Kind but professional.  Never left a glass empty.

FOOD:  Food was pretty good.  Here is what we ordered:

SHISHITO PEPPERS:  Had a great flavor.  Good take on the shishito pepper.

FRENCH FRIES:  Yummmyyyyyy oh my god.  These fries were amazing.  Fries were really what kept me going on my trip through Canada and these fries were delish.  The whole table was thankful I ordered them.

It looks like they have changed their menu since I ate here, so I can't say exactly what I ate but my appetizer was VERY tasty.  Burrata, grilled raddichio, and bread...mm...I loved the flavors together.

I had ricotta ravioli for dinner.  Okay portion.  Mellow, on the verge of bland.  Wish it had some more flavor.

We ordered three deserts.  Two of us picked one and then let the waiter pick the third.  The desert that stood out to me was some kind of passion fruit desert, which was amazing.  I would definitely order this again!

As far as my \"fancy\" meals go for Toronto, Nota Bene was my favorite.  Relaxed, fun atmosphere but still upscale and professional."}
{"text":"The food was excellent (we had fish dishes and the creme caramel for dessert),  the service was fawningly attentive, and the restaurant had an energetic vibe (and cool art work!).  

Still, although I'm cool with paying a premium for a perfect dish, I can't stomach the exorbitant mark-up on things like wine ($12 for a glass of house prosecco?) and fries (sorry, I mean pomme frites! -- also $12).

Since I always divide (yumminess + service + ambiance) by price, four stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Nota Bene on the last day of our honeymoon, and it was the perfect place to spend our last night in Toronto.

The restaurant itself has a very welcoming atmosphere.  The restaurant design is very art deco, chic and classy.  The soft undertones of the table settings and benches contrast with the bold singular leather seats and compliment the beautiful abstract artwork by the young Canadian artist, Alex D'Arcy.

The Saturday night we visited, the dining room was packed with people dressed in cocktail party attire.  It seemed to be the hot spot for people celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, and all girl outings like bachelorettes or just a night around town.

Nota Bene has a seasonal menu.  Their menu offers something for everyone:  meat and potatoes (steak frites, a beef brisket burger) and more unusual Asian fusions (an appetizer of Tunisian octopus and kimchee).

For my meal, I couldn't resist Jennifer's stilton beef brisket burger with pommes frites ($24), and my husband ordered the wild digby sea scallops with black bean, ginger, chili, coriander, and asparagus ($28).  Both entrees were absolutely delicious and full of flavor.

For dessert we went for the sticky toffee pudding, accompanied with pecan praline and spotted dick ice cream ($12) as well as a salted carmel truffle ($2.25).  The truffle was just okay and could have been skipped, but the sticky toffee pudding goes on my list of the best desserts I've ever had.  The pudding is served warm, the perfect contrast between the cold ice cream and sticky praline sauce.  If only I could eat this dessert every day.... Mmmm....  It was so good!

The service was impeccable.  Our waiter was very attentive and you could tell that the kitchen was run to be as efficient as possible.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to impress a date or celebrate a special occasion.  The food, atmosphere, and service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Well decided to go back to Nota Bene since they have this awesome sticky date pudding and they renovated over the summer to a more Canadiana look.

Boy was I disappointed. Hence the one star. Where should I start. 

Service-  our waiter sucked or was racist or sexist. He never checked on us, nor ask how our food was. He was never around so we always had to find another server to give us more water or the dessert menu. And even when we paid, he never asked, so how was everything? Your typical server banter. He didn't care!  Just machine to pay and that was it.

I say racist / sexist for we were the only two Asian women in the restaurant. The rest were white men in suits. Didn't realize the
whole Trump feel would happen here. Ironically isn't the co-owner / chef Asian!!!!

Food- food serving are much smaller and more expensive. They had this lobster salad before and I swear it was like 19$ but now it's like $26 or was it $29. The portion was small and you barely got lobster.
The famous sticky date pudding was HALF the portion it was before and I think they charge more too.

My boss comes here quite a bit but I will need to tell him it's a rip and racist. Need to find him another go to restaurant to have business lunches for there are so many restaurants in Toronto to put up with this crap."}
{"text":"Not quite what I was expecting. Went here as a pre-opera option, especially since they have a special menu. I have to say that the food was just OK, hence the three stars. I was not completely blown away by the steak or salad. Would recommend it as a good option for pre-Opera food, but would have rather settled at something a little less pricey nearby for a more delicious experience."}
{"text":"Nota Bene has still got it. Our waiter was fantastic recommending the primativo wine (delicious and affordable). Also enjoyed the Cava. We had a wonderful salad based with beets and perfectly cooked toast and then we splurged and had the 60 day dry aged ribeye for two. Amazing!!!! Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Where to go in Toronto for a burger.  Yep, seems a challenge with the explosion of gourmet burger joints across the city.  Ok, so up front, my go-to joint (not really a joint) is Richmond Station.  The burger is awesome and the staff is equally great.  Last minute decision for dinner tonite and they were filled.  Decided to wander around and walked by Nota Bene.  Heard lots about them but never stopped.  Well, there were a few seats at the bar, so I was in.

Bartener was great.,  She knew the drinks & dishes in detail and happily answered my many questions.  Simple menu (refreshing, compared to the restaurants that have pages of options and food that is equally standard),  Danger is a short menu puts the pressure on the restaurant to excel at the options.  Well, the burger was great.  Burger was done rare with pickles, maple bacon and quebec cheese. was planning on passing on maple bacon but the bartender said they would not overpower the burger and add a great flavor. Glad I listened to her.  my next stool neighbor had scallops and fiddleheads and she said they were great.  

Only part I did not like was a custom cocktail (sounded good, but too sweet for me).  Tried it and passed.  The bartender did not skip a beat and took it back and offered other options.  Seems like common sense but have been to too many places where they remove the drink, leave it on the bill and expect a tip.  

I'm a bar guy.  When traveling by myself I don't enjoy at a table.  I like the bar and conversations you get into.  Tonite was no exception.  Met 2 great people. A fashion consultant from NYC via the UK that just published her first article in Bon International and a marketing expert from the neighborhood and a Tuesday nite regular....

Will be back......"}
{"text":"2nd time I have been here. I was surprised when i was able to reserve a table the same night when other plans backfired. Even nicer, free corkage on the bottle we brought because we sat down at 9pm!  Service is so on spot, polite and not pushy at all. Food of course was done perfectly, served at the proper temperature, and delicious!  People at first glance may say this place is expensive....but these days its no more expensive than some newly hyped up restaurant that is still trying to figure things out with their menu and service.  For the price the value is certainly there. See for yourself."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for GREAT food.  I had a lobster club salad that was PHENOMENAL.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy.  The waiters were SUPER attentive and had great suggestions and knowledge of the menu.

I love trying new things and this was definitely the spot to do that...all around yummy."}
{"text":"I just went to this place for sumericious. 
On their website, its Toronto's best restaurant . Are you guys scamming us? 

Bread with butter is good.
Strawberry iced tea tasted nothing.
I had tuna sashimi  for starter NY striploin  main .and dessert was sobert.

and my friend had a corn soup 
They should have said
Cold soup instead of corn soup.

And lavioli.
OMG 

Tuna sashimi was not impressed me at all
They chose the wrong veggie for tuna.
Tasted too fishy.

My steak was too too salty I need water right away. French fries was too hard and crunch. I rather pay to macdonald.
All my other friends had Lavioli and they were not happy with that food.
I tasted lavioli.
This is the best part .
The texture like tufu and taste like cum.
(Don't ask me how I know it) 

It wasn't special.
My two star was for service and atmosphere.

Some ppl might still like this place for unique taste. But do not be so confident of you guys food please."}
{"text":"I would prob come here only between 4-7pm.  Food pretty expensive, taste is good but for the price I expected more.  $35 for 4 tiny scallops and $26 for 4 pieces of tiny lobsters in salad is too much.  I rather have a lobster roll down the street with half the price.  The happy hour menu looks awesome however!"}
{"text":"Their crispy duck salad is literally the key to my heart.

I was so happy that they kept it on their menu when they reopened - same level of quality if not better.

The duck was perfect! It was tender, juicy, and very flavorful. 
Now adding the crispy skin to the equation and I was in heaven. 

I like how they didn't skimp out on the meat too, plenty of it on the plate, which helped with keeping the flavors consistent throughout each bite. Super refreshing with the herbs too"}
{"text":"So I was really having mixed emotions about the rating. 
 
However I can't say that I've ever had such a bad service experience in such a nice restaurant before. So I'm leaving it at the 2.  We partook of lunch. 

The food was very good we had the special of the day which was a pasta with a Bolognese sauce, and it was great. It's really quite unfortunate that Service was not great.

We were sat at the table, We were brought water, and then we waited and waited and waited to place our order. Finally another server came by and we asked them to please send our server over to our table. After a few minutes she showed up, and took our order. It was by no means complicated. We ordered some sparkling water and a glass of wine and the mains. We then sat and talked and talked and we waited quite some time for the food, which you don't mind if the food is really good and the server stops by to check on you. 

The server even came and waited on the table next to us, and carefully avoided us trying to get her attention. Finally the food came, no sign of the wine, we started to enjoy the meal - the waitress again came to the table next to us and we tried to get her attention to tell her about the wine, but again she ignored us.

Someone else eventually came and took our plates as we were finished our meal and asked how it was -- and I said it was great except I never got my wine, they apologize profusely and she came over and then she said that it was her fault that she had forgotten. By then I just wanted to leave. It was a very uncomfortable dining experience and not up to the caliber of restaurant that I expect this one to be. 

Nota Bene, you make great food but you really need to get your stuff together in terms of what is going on with your serving staff. There were too many people at the check-in desk and not enough people on the floor giving service to your patrons, additionally the people next to us also complained about the lengthy wait and lack of attention. Sadly I don't think I will be back anytime soon. It's too bad really."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here! If you eat after 9pm, you can BYO sans corkage fee. Great place for a date. Stroll around downtown Toronto when you're done. Upscale casual dress. The decor is chic and modern. The food was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked. Service was warm and attentive. Rightfully named one of Toronto's best new restaurants in 2009. Two appetizers, two entrees, two desserts, and two chocolates came to $125 before tip. Very reasonable. Great place! Will return next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We went here for Valentine's Day and took part in their $105 dollar tasting menu. In general, they are constantly changing their tasting menus in order to give different tastes, but the price usually stays about 85-100 for them while stand alone dishes range in the 30s. 

We were so hungry that I wasn't able to get pictures of everything but I got the main course that mattered . First they started us off with snacks: prosciutto and apple chip, ratatouille on some sort of cracker and a spoonful of lobster. Favourite one was the ratatouille. Second was the tuna tartare or crispy duck salad. These were meh. I don't know I liked the flavours but just it seemed like something I could get at any Vietnamese place with a crispier duck. And the tartare was the same. Also the tuna tartare only came with two small taro chips.
Next, the burrata ravioli, it came with two pieces. At this time in the night mean my boyfriend were slightly disappointed in portion sizes, maybe we just eat a lot but it just seemed like there was this WANT for more ravioli, more taro chips and we were feeling kind of meh at this point.

Once the mains came we both ordered tenderloin we were so happy it was cooked so amazingly, we were definitely full after this course but the theme of wanting more was still present. Two small pieces of bok choy, little swipe of some purée, small nicely cut potato. Flavours were amazing but lemme have someeeeeee u know. 
Desserts and cheese were great, including the truffles, no problems here. 

Would I say this is worth the price, yes. But I am begging you chef lee you have amazing flavours, just add a little bit more of those smaller components of your meals it will make all the difference.





Main theme overall was that"}
{"text":"I went to this place without knowing much about it. That said, I went with a mid-sized group of people for dinner and had a good time. My sea bass tasted great, but for the price I guess I would've wanted a bit more substance - the plate was a bit sparse IMO. My bf got the Jennifer brisket burger and said it tasted good also, but has had better at other places. The sticky toffee pudding however was delicious - I don't think you can ever go wrong with that! We also got some sides like the poutine and onion rings, they were also delicious and filling so no complaints there. What really stood out that night for us was the service. Our waiter was really exceptional; patient and knowledgeable, he pretty made us feel like the only diners in the restaurant that night. All in all, good food and even better service. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're feeling a bit more upscale for some fine dishes."}
{"text":"* Note - This review was written during Nota Bene's Winterlicious menu selections. This may not be representative of Nota Bene's regular menu.

Nota Bene was one of the four Winterlicious restaurants I've decided to try out this month. I've booked a table for 6 people to try out their offerings. We were lucky to be scheduled a day after their entire renovation of the dining space. The restaurant's ambience was modern and serene (albeit a bit weird with the tumbleweed decorative pieces on the ceiling), with just the right amount of lighting. 

The service standard was high end, from the coat check to the bill tabulation. The waiter was friendly and gave great recommendations. The food timing was excellent, paired with multiple waiters setting down the plates simultaneously as the dishes come out. Water was refilled regularly without the \"pestering\" gestures of some other restaurants.

Now to the food. The 6 of us effectively ordered every combination of the Winterlicious menu. My starter was a venison terrine with crackers and assortment of condiments. The terrine was certainly tasty while having a good balance paired with the condiments of whole grain mustard and apple puree. It would've been nice to see some green in there to cut down the richness, but the dish was flavourful nonetheless. For main, I had the duck confit with lentils and jeu, a wonderful dish with great flavours all round. Only complaint was that the skin was quite dry and that the condiments that were on my starter reappeared as a garnish for my main, a lack of creativity it seems. And finally, the dessert was a dark chocolate brownie with whip cream. A finisher that was so-so due to the cream's lack of taste, possibly to balance out the sweetness of the brownie.

All in all, it was a great start to Winterlicious. I definitely enjoyed the flavours of the food, as well as the beautiful presentation it came with (Instagram worthy!). I would not be surprised if I find myself back here during the summer to sample their full menu in their modern decorative interior, maybe just without the dry foliage overhead."}
{"text":"Expensuve but great. Superlative service. We both had halibut which was well seasoned, perfectly cooked. Brussel sprouts were fantastic. Gin was fabulous"}
{"text":"I'm shocked to hear all the rave reviews for this place.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, but nothing stood out and I felt like I overpaid for a mediocre meal.

My friend and I planned this to be our expensive, delicious night out in Toronto.  Upon arrival, the hostess ignored us for a few minutes, and then unsmilingly led us to our table.  As I looked over the menu, I was disappointed to see that the options listed on the website were not what was available on the actual menu.  While it happens often that restaurants change their menus, I couldn't help but feel disappointed, since I had preselected the items about which I was excited.  

I started with the steak tartare, which was good, but nothing special.  I much prefer my tartare on toast crisps, as opposed to the potato chips on which this was served.  Also, no quail egg?  That made me sad.  My friend had the soft shell crab salad.  The crab was great, but the rest of the noodles, etc, fell flat.

For our entrees, we both had the scallop and octopus dish.  It was listed as being in an Argentinean chimichurri sauce.  To be fair, the scallops and octopus were both prepared perfectly.  They were cooked to perfection, unfortunately, the seasoning was not.  The chimichurri was barely flavored and just looked more like a weak pesto.  There was a lack of salt and pepper and I just felt bored by the dish.  And, although our waiter was friendly, he was absent and possibly too busy with other tables, as he never checked back to see how our meals were tasting.  This was unfortunate, as I was never able to get salt and pepper to make everything taste better.

For dessert, we shared the fruit crumble.  For $10, I was imagining something amazing.  Nope.  Just an average fruit crumble that I could have made myself.

Upon leaving, the two hostesses did not wish us a good night or even acknowledge our presence.  

Overall, a disappointing dinner.  Thankfully, we had an incredible night in Prince Edward County the night before and ate well enough to make up for this experience."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to Nota Bene on Valentines Day to celebrate. I had made a reservation for us weeks in advance.

We arrived early for our reservation and had drinks at the bar while waiting for our table to be available.

Once seated, the hospitality was outstanding and the wait staff were very attentive and friendly to us.

We ordered:
- Crisp Duck Salad
- NB Artisanal Salumi
- Hamachi Ceviche (complementary)

Main:
Wild Digby Sea Scallops
Rabbit Soffrito, Pappardelle Pasta

The food was absolutely delicious. We requested some substitution on the salumi dish - and ended up with a nice selection of salumi and cheeses to enjoy together.

The most noteworthy dishes would be the ceviche, the scallops and the pappardelle pasta. 

We enjoyed the meal with a bottle of red wine - a 2010 vintage bottle of Tawse Grower's Blend, Pinot Noir. 

In all, the food and the service were truly excellent. We were also invited to take a look at the kitchen at the end of our meal. It was quite a treat.

Will definitely make it back here to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday celebration.  Excellent food and drinks.  Hats off to the bartender who made an excellent pisco sour.  Excellent staff - Taylor - who made great suggestions for pairings and was very charming and accommodating especially when some of our guests were late."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant decor that keeps up with the modern trends.  I've been here twice in the last two years and noticed that the menu has changed.  First time was for dessert and the second time my friends and I came for the full dining experience.  My most recent dining experience at Nota Bene has been quite disappointing.  

The waiter did not seem to be knowledgeable about the wine selection.  The food was mediocre at best.  The rabbit ragu was a dish that resembles something random that was thrown together in the kitchen.  The paparadelle pasta was dry tossed with rabbit, fatty pork and random vegetables including little pieces of olive.  I thought it was just me, but as I looked over to my friend who also ordered it we realized that we had both not touched our dishes.  When we told the waiter he became very defensive and said that he had already asked us how our dishes were and repeated this a few times.  He did take the nearly untouched dishes off our bill however.  Sadly, I was really looking to satisfy my pasta craving that day and so I'm left really unsatisfied.  We stayed for some small desserts including their macarons, which were decent."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this restaurant, especially from all of the hype surrounding it and the delicious looking pictures....

...but to be honest, I can say I liked it okay (if that makes any sense).  

I went there for a friend's 30th birthday, and we went all out: drinks, appetizers, entrees, desserts, the works.  VERY expensive bill, but if it had been worth it, I wouldn't have minded (went to Kobe in Japan just for Kobe beef...amazing.)

Too bad this place was not quite worth the cost.  

We had a tuna tartar dish and the mozzarella appetizers, both decent but sort of skimpy.  My friend got the cod, which was delicious, another friend had the steak, which looked great in terms of steak, and I had the rabbit pasta dish.  It was my first time eating rabbit, and I thought it was very tasty...but was it really worth the amount it cost?  I don't think so.  

It just felt like each dish was lacking some fundamental component that would make the dish go from just \"really good\" to \"I can't stop smiling this is so amazing\".  Nota Bene just did not do that for me."}
{"text":"Decent food but tried it during summerlicious. Am sure it would be even better."}
{"text":"What to say about this restaurant besides it is impeccable in every facit of the word. I've been here twice now, once with my family and once on business, and on both occasions my expectations were exceeded not only by the staff, but the quality of the food...and of course the wine. 

I won't even go into making recommendations because I feel that almost everything on the menu is worth tasting. I have yet to be disappointed.

Well done, Nota Bene. Well done."}
{"text":"This review is only for Winterlicious 2015 Dinner ($45). My experience at Nota Bene wasn't good and I wouldn't return in the future. It was not worth the $45 price tag for the dinner. The portion size was a hit and miss, service was OK, but the food was bland for me.

*My Friend courses: 
-Quebec Duck & Foie Gras Terrine: The entrée came in a delightfully arranged plate of foie gras. There was a piece of pistachio granola that came with the dish. It definitely complemented the taste of the goose very well. 

-Tongue & Cheek: The 'tongue in cheek' had two types of meat arranged very nicely: the beef cheek and the veal tongue confit. It came with a potato pancake placed underneath the veal and sprinkled feta cheese. I felt that both the veal and the beef cheek tasted a little bland. The feta cheese was really the only source of strong flavor, otherwise it was not very memorable.

-Baked Bruce Peninsula Spy Apple: The Baked Bruce Peninsula Spy Apple was essentially apple crumble with vanilla ice cream. The presentation was very well done. The crumble was warm and tasted delicious.It wasn't too sweet and the texture was fantastic.

*My courses: 
-Crispy Duck Salad: The salad had a spicy touch, yet refreshing with the green papaya and coriander, but nothing outstanding. The duck was cooked well, moist, and how can a fatty crispy duck skin not be good?! I wished the dish came with some dressing, even just some lime to tie the whole dish together as the salad was lacking in flavor. In addition, I prefer my salad to have different textures. With this, you are only getting the crunchy texture from all the ingredients, it got boring after a few bites.

-Grilled Mediterranean Seabass: The fish was cooked to perfection, soft and buttery and the portion was quite generous. The escarole was too bitter for my taste, I believe they over-cooked it, and the lime didn't help to reduce the bitterness. (I understand escarole is bitter, but I have had it before when you cook it just right, the bitterness is not as prevalent).  The bitterness from the escarole over-powered the fish. The broth was bland and beans were tough (under-cooked), just not good at all...

-Clementine Sorbet: The portion was tiny! It's like the size of a golf ball. The sorbet was very light and refreshing, it tasted like those frizzy vitamin c drink that I used to drink when I was a child :). The yogurt crisp was okay, I wish there was something sweet to compliment the sour sorbet though."}
{"text":"The ambience is superb, the service is decent (will get more into that), but I'm not sure the food is worth its value.

Went to Nota Bene for a company lunch, and there were 10 of us all together. They took our coats and seated us at a large round table, which was very nice. The waitress we had was friendly and very keen on refilling our glasses with water, but she dropped the ball several times with the orders, and it ended up taking about 30 minutes for us to order.

We started with the cheese and olives, which we ordered alongside the bread and olive oil. However, the cheese and olives came and the bread did not. Hungry, my party waited as long as we could for the bread that was \"cooling\" and finally decided to just eat the cheese and olives. 30 minutes later, the bread finally came. Both were delicious, but would have been better if they could have been served together as requested.

For my entree I had the cavatelli, which was very rich but not as flavourful as I had hoped it would be. My colleagues who had the lobster salad noted that the bacon was a very odd addition to the salad. Those who had the cod filet were happy with their choice, so perhaps I will try that next time.

The three desserts we ordered, warm chocolate cake, sticky date pudding, and molten cheesecake, were out of this world delicious. If you visit Nota Bene, I would definitely recommend ordering dessert.

Overall, it was a nice dining experience, and I look forward to returning. Next time I will give other entrees a try, and of course, will be ordering more dessert."}
{"text":"Easy to miss spot that looks tiny from the outside but massive and elegant inside. Decor is upscale and lowkey. Never a complain for restaurants that offer coat check. 

I came here during lunch on a week day for their regular lunch menu. Great selection of appetizers, mains, and dessert, a ton of seafood to choose from. It wasnt hard for me to decide on the lobster salad. Love that they have sparkling water too.

Our food arrived quickly, which is always appreciated for lunch on a work day. My salad was amazingly dressed and I was surprised by the amount and size of lobster they had. Huge variety of greens (celery, cucumbers, kale, avocado...yum!!) complimented the not overly cream dressing. Our server checked up on us couple times, and water was being refilled before I emptied my glass.

We didn't have time to stay for dessert but I will definitely be looking forward to come back to give their dessert menu a try."}
{"text":"What an amazing place to have great wine and great food. The steak for two is mind blowing and it comes paired with bone marrow and friend fries. The lobster salad, I could of just ate that the entire night... It was that delicious. I recommend this place if you want a romantic dinner or a quiet dinner for four. Not ideal for big crowds from what I saw."}
{"text":"Bold neon yellow exterior makes this appear from outside to be a lounge (or even a nice diner), but it's actually a decent if stiff restaurant.

Good wine list and service. 

Stand-out lobster salad.

Service as crisp and starched as the napkins.

Cool washrooms."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to take me to a surprise dinner and he didn't know this was more kinda upscale, so I wore jeans and knee high boots to this restaurant. There were girls dressed in black dresses, heels and beautiful jewellery,  so I felt kinda out of place lol. 

The food was excellent! I had the fish and he had pasta. I also got a gin and tonic which was $20. it had cucumber, lemon grass and hibiscus flowers. That was pretty interesting, and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My partner and I had our anniversary here. 

Our waiter was ridiculously nice. I'm guessing he just assume two young couple don't know anything. Anyways, he offered suggestions on the best wine for the occasion as well as dishes that would sit well with our pallets. 

The experience was good. So was the mood and setting. Definitely a place I would go back to over and over. Pay day of course."}
{"text":"i was sooooooooo disappointed at this restaurant! yet another overrated one. after reading all the good reviews on yelp i thought i would be impressed but i wasn't. flavours were all mediocre.

my bf ordered a \"hanger steak\" because it was the saturday dinner special and it was SOOOOOOO chewy that he couldn't finish it and he normally eats everything. the steak was also tasteless.

i ordered the scallops which for the price it was marked at, i expected more, flavour wise, technique wise and portion wise. it was a dish priced at $27 on the menu but i was charged in the end for $28. anyway the point is that thirty bucks for four scallops and five pieces of asparagus is WAY TOO MUCH dont ya think?? the flavours were veryy flat 

oh yea and the pomme frites... i think getting a mcds fries wouldve been more satisfying

maybe next time i shouldn't read reviews before visiting restaurants because it sets expectations"}
{"text":"The food was very fresh, very good and cheaper than expected. The Service was top notch and since we were out of town my wife was dressed very casual, I would recommended dressing up for this restaurant and they were able to accommodate us."}
{"text":"I visited Nota Bene off peak hours, when they were just beginning their dinner service. The evening staff had arrived and were just setting up the finishing touches, that or chatting with each other in front of customers. I stood at the entrance for only a brief moment but had to interrupt the conversation of the staff to have them acknowledge that I would like to be seated. Was not very professional. I, however, was on my own and was in for a small bite and a glass of wine. I ordered the civiche which was delicious. The serving was smaller than what I expected but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I am not used to having civiche with coconut milk but it balanced the heat and citrus nicely. 

After reading other reviews, I am not sure I would return for a main course, but I would be tempted to try other appetisers followed by cocktails"}
{"text":"Overview of  my UYE Burger Tasting! Review number 3 in less than two months! 
BIG Thanks for everyone for coming and to Nota Bene's management and PR team for being so lovely and accommodating. We loved the complimentary charcuterie. Delish, as always for our starving Yelpers! 

I'm so terrible, but Nota Bene on a whole is definitely on my top five favourite restaurants in the city. 

VIBE 
Our group was in the private room which is less like a white, windowless room a la Kubrick (thanks for the vivid imagery Vivek) and more like a sectioned off warm, dimly lit room off to the side of the main dining room. Lovely! 

The company was fantastic as well and so eager to try the food and burgers at Nota Bene! 

Service was phenomenal, as always. Our main server Sophia (I think that was her name) was so lovely, knowledgeable and quick on the menu. We also got separate bills (a MUST for a big group).  We may have even converted her over to Yelp! 

WE ATE 
Mainly, the burgers! I ate the burger, anyway. :) 
The size of the burger is quite surprising. It looks much bigger than it is but though it looks small it is DENSE and packs a punch! 
The parsley inside the burger was a surprise. I thought it might have a wee bit more flavour but I did like the kick of the stilton cheese on top of the burger. 
I liked that you could get the option of brie (didn't know!) 
Side pickles = bonus!

Though this was a solid burger, it was not my favourite. 
The fries were a good portion and accompaniment to the burger. 

But the burger crown still belongs to Holy Chuck in my books! 

That said, if you're on business and want something hearty before you're off to the airport, this is a good choice. I certainly wolfed down this burger! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
I love having burger events. They're non pretentious ways to socialize and bond with people. 
The burger was a 4 out of 5 on my scale. A bit more flavour and I would have been happy!"}
{"text":"The only thing worth noting about Nota Bene is the incredible difference between the food and the front-of-house operation.

Is the food good?  Yes.  However, when one drops over $350 on two appetizers, two entrees, a $89 bottle of wine plus three cocktails, one should receive more than just good food.  

The night started so poorly that had we another place to go, we would have walked immediately.  In retrospect, we should have done so.

We arrived 40 minutes early to have a cocktail and relax.  We met the front desk and advised that we were there and would take a seat at the bar.  Further, we let them know that while we had no expectation about being seated early, should the opportunity arrive we would be willing to sit whenever convenient.

After this conversation we took our seats at the bar and noticed a screen detailing open tables and turned our attention to the cocktail menu.  After ordering our drinks we settled into our conversation and thirty minutes passed quickly.  

It was at this time that we noticed that there were seven two-tops open.

Thinking that the front desk might have forgotten us, I went over to remind them that we were there.  The responded gruffly and told me to back to the bar and they would get me when ready.  

Twenty minutes pass as does our appointed reservation time...

Seeing more than five two-tops open, I go back up and they tell me that they are setting our table.

Five minutes later they lead my wife and I to the single worst table in the establishment - one that we had sat and watched stay open for the last 25 minutes.

Frustrated, I ask if we could take any one of the FOUR other open two-tops.  After expressing her frustration, she told us to stand there and she would see what she could do.  She was clearly very angry and thought little of us.

She comes back after a very uncomfortable delay and finally led us to another table which was not fully set.  This despite the FOUR that sat ready and waiting for patrons.  Two of which would never get used - at least as of 10:30 pm.

We enjoyed our meal and our server was very kind.  We even told her of our displeasure with the front desk and she was mortified.  Our favorite part was when she returned to let us know that she even told the manager - who cared so much that he never came over and never said a word.

And don't even get me started about their wine list.  Nothing disappoints me more than seeing a wine I have at home and bought for $45 on a wine list for $175.

My apologies if this comes across as more rambling than informative, but having a romantic and expensive night ruined by a front desk really frustrates."}
{"text":"No.

Not good, even when it's free.

:P"}
{"text":"Even I was a bit skeptical about taking the 15 month old to this swanky joint.. but it was one of those social experiments that I just HAD to do! So that's how we found ourselves at Nota Bene one Friday evening. The neat closet of a coat check has a wall at the far back that housed our folded up UPPA baby quite nicely and the hubs generously carried it back at forth so that the lovely hostess didn't have to do any heavy lifting. All eyes were on us as we entered the main dining area with a potential monster in tow and we were placed near an empty table (though a lovely pair of girlfriends quickly filled those seats into our main course). It was all smiles from the moment we entered Nota Bene's bar area.  High chair and fresh baked bread to entertain - check and check! The carafes and wine glasses were carefully placed away from the Little Monkey.. you'd think each of these servers had kids of their own!

 

The food here is absolutely divine, made with fresh quality ingredients that will delight your palate with random fusions you'd never think of trying out on your own. While I had been here previously, it was the first time for both, the Little Monkey and the hubs. We started with the Hamachi Ceviche presented in a gorgeous bed of ice. Corn nuts, coconut milk and avocado were pleasant surprises and very different from your traditional Hamachi expectations. Next up for the starters were the Salt Cod, chili and potato fritters. The Nova Scotian with me HAD to get the salt cod. While initially dismayed by the small portion, he was soon won over by the warm ooey gooeyness and the Little Monkey was also a huge fan of these adult tater tots and boiled eggs that accompanied the dish!

 

A bottle of Graffigna Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon kept us hydrated as we waited for our mains and we entertained the Little Monkey by letting 'read' her book and charm the ladies next to us. I had the Wild Digby Sea Scallops as my main. Four fairly large scallops sat on a lovely avocado and Thai curry paste puree. I know... another lovely fusion. Doesn't hurt that I absolutely love avocado! The mango and papaya salad that came along was a burst of summer and also served to entertain the Little Monkey who's a fan of all things hailing from the fruit family. I couldn't help but dip into the hub's Venison which was cooked to perfection and served with the most delicious mushrooms we've ever had! The blueberries baffled our minds and is now on my 'must cook with at home' list! The peppercorn jus was finger likin' good.


Despite being absolutely stuffed, I ordered a Sticky Toffee Pudding  and asked them to swap the praline and spotted dick ice cream for the Tahitian Vanilla Bean ice cream as the hubs was hankering for it. I do wish we stuck to the original pairing because the vanilla bean wasn't up to our expectation.The sticky toffee was decadent and to be honest, I was way too stuffed to enjoy it to the fullest.

As for the Little Monkey.. she was on her best behaviour and the server and door staff were so impressed! The Manager on duty has kids himself and everyone welcomed us, made us feel at ease (the banter of other guests ensured that any whining was easily drowned out). I was on a high and very proud of the well behaved little one as I left the restaurant . The wine helped too! Given that the menu is constantly changing and that the service was beyond our expectations, I can't wait to go back! From start to finish there was a real feel good sensation to our dinner and to that I applaud Nota Bene!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmmm mmm.

This place is delicious. 

Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner and was not disappointed. Nice ambiance and great wine selection.

Foodwise, we had:
Crispy Duck Salad - Fresh and flavourful. Comes on a bed of green papaya. Yum. Bonus - we were sharing this as an appetizer and they nicely split it into two portions (so my bf couldn't take the bigger half. Sweet!)
Tuna Tartare - I'm a fiend for tuna so the chance of me not liking this was slim. Still, it was fresh, and soft and melt-in-your-mouth good.
Shaved Onion Rings - Crispy and light, and without a greasy taste. And they will bring you ketchup if you ask (not that they need it).
Sticky Toffee Pudding - My boyfriend declared this the best dessert he's ever had. It's damn good.

Clientele is mixed. Saw some familes, some suits and lots of botoxed ladies-who-lunch types. 

Definitely go."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful dinner at Nota Bene. Service was attentive and warm. Drinks were interesting and there is a good wine list with lots of tasty options available by the glass. We split the charcuterie platter and it was perfect. I am a duck fan and the duck proscuitto was meltingly flavourful.
The zuchini blossom app is a real treat - not heavy or greasy- just crispy with the right touch of salt from a dusting of parm.
The short ribs fell off the bone and the boudin was declared to be delicious by my dining companion.
Desert was a decadent molten chocolate cake - yes I know these are on almost every menu in town but this one is actually worth saving room for. All in all a great evening. We will be going back."}
{"text":"I got a $110 piece of 6 oz. Kobe beef. It was fine. Caviar is dope. Does anyone even come here?"}
{"text":"I had read a blog post about the 4-7 Bar Snacks (there is a $4 menu from 4-7pm), and the dishes looked delicious! After reviewing the photos many times, I knew exactly what I wanted to try. I made a reservation for 2, and when I arrived for my reservation at 6pm, I was escorted upstairs. I noticed that there was no one up in the dining room, and the bar area was packed, so I asked if the snacks were also available in the dining area, and was told no. Luckily there was sitting in the bar area and sat there instead. My friend arrived a few minutes later and we began to order. The lowest priced drink items were the beers at $8, and the dishes I wanted to try were no longer on the menu. I was incredibly disappointed by this. Nevertheless, I found a couple of decent sounding dishes and ordered those. We ordered the beef sliders, the squid, the pork belly sliders and the air-dried Cumbrae Farms beef. When the dishes arrived, we got two sliders of each, two small portions of squid, and thin pieces of beef which tasted like prosciutto, so I only had one piece - after visiting a Prosciutto factory in Italy I ate so much of it there that it will be a while before I can eat cold cuts again. 

The only item I liked were the beef sliders. The meat was juicy and wrapped in melted cheese, the bacon was crispy and salty, the bread was warm, evenly buttered and the fact that the bread was cheese bread, was a nice touch. The 2nd dish I liked was the squid because it was well cooked - not chewy or rubbery. The pork belly got lost in the pickles, ketchup and lettuce. Though the fries were delicious though unusual for a sandwich - unless you are in Greece!

Overall it was not a bad experience, but unless I am craving beef sliders, I doubt I will return. Though I have to point out that the service was excellent (e.g., I was flip flopping on what beer to get, and they offered me a sample. They were more than happy to give us separate bills, and they answered all our questions with kindness and a great deal of knowledge)."}
{"text":"I must preface this review by saying I have taken the time to review about 2 otherbusinesses on Yelp so it is a testament to my enjoyment that I am writing this now.  

I visited Toronto for the first time this weekend and had the opportunity to eat at NB.  I have to say my girlfriend and I absolutely loved everything about this restaurant.  It was fine dining at its very best.  The decor was classy and the ambiance was enjoyable without being stuffy.  Our waitress, Zofia, was great - she was friendly and explained the menu thoroughly, even giving us some food/drink/tourist recommendations.  At the end of our meal she stopped to chat about our visit and even gave us the name of a nearby bar that the NB staff frequent and told us to come along the following night.

The highlight of the night, and quite possibly my culinary life, was the cavatelli pasta we shared as an appetizer.  Recommended by our waitress, it was rich and savory, the pasta was cooked to perfection, and it left us both wanting more.  Again on Zofia's recommendation, my girlfriend got the Nota Bene cocktail which was delicious and we are in the process of recreating at home.  Also of note was the sticky toffee pudding and ice cream.  It was a great way to end the evening.  

I have to say if I return to Toronto, a trip to NB would definitely be a strong consideration among the many other options for fine dining the city has to offer.  Brilliant all around - keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"the food at nota bene comes with a high price but you definitely leave happy, so it's overall worth the experience. my favourite place in toronto. the $40 wagu beef burger is amazing!!!!!!!!!!! i got mine medium rare and it was amazing... juicy, just bloody enough, so much flavour... with pulled beef on top... beef on beef is sooo good!!! haha. the cheese plate was ok, it was not the best cheese plate i've had but they were good cheeses... i just didn't like the hard crusty bread that came with it.. and usually when you do cheese plates you get pairings of veggie or fruit concoctions. not the case here. the apps were amazing... softshell crab and the crispy duck... SO good... really, it was awesome! the dinner was perfect in every way and i find myself longing for that burger!!! it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I organized a tweetup on Oct 26 at Nota Bene. They did separate checks and we were allowed to take pics of the food - a must for a tweetup!

I made a reservation for 10 and then had to change it twice and they were very accommodating. It ended up being 5 people including me. 3 of us were there early and we got a drink at the bar. The bar area is pretty nice. More casual than the dining room. You can sit there, enjoy a drink and watch Queen St. People watching is fun.

One of my twitter friends is a foodie and he was chatting up a storm with the staff. We received a complimentary charcuterie board and pumpkin truffles and salted caramels! They were yummy.

Now back to the food...

I ordered the burger and sticky toffee pudding for dessert.

The burger was perfect and juicy! The sticky toffee pudding is their signature dessert it was one of the best desserts I have had.

My friends were very happy with their food as well. I asked for a house red and it was so buttery and smooth. I forgot to ask the name. 

Overall the food and service was amazing. I very highly recommend them. I have never had such good service any where else in Toronto. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Nota Bene at the recommendation of a client while I was traveling through Toronto on business. I stopped by for a quick bite on a Friday night before flying back to Baltimore the next morning. 

I arrived around 10:30, and decided to just sit at the bar for speeds sake (I was exhausted after a week of training). The atmosphere was warm, and maintained the bohemian-posh mood that hums through the Queen Street West area. The bartender was friendly and entertaining, providing mischievous quips and chat. It was a nice addition since I was dining alone. I'd say he executed his role as the quintessential confidant with ease.

The wine list isn't overwhelmingly extensive, but what they lack in breadth of selection, they compensate with the depth of thought put into each item. I ordered the Malbec (glass), and was pleased with the spiciness and smooth earthy finish. 

For food I ordered the Crispy Duck Salad and the pommes frites. The salad was unlike anything I've ever tasted... tender duck and crunchy strips of skin layered atop Asian vegetables, cucumbers, and a tangy yet smoky vinaigrette. It's a must-try. The pommes frites were typical shoestring fries, but cooked by the God of French Frydom. There is an art to the fry, and Nota Bene has mastered it. Sprinkled with Pecorino cheese and served with a petite portion of heavenly lemon-garlic aioli, these fries are a step above the rest. These are labeled as \"for the table\", but order one for yourself... you won't want to share."}
{"text":"I had always heard great things about this restaurant and it has been on my foodie list for a while but I was highly disappointed in my experience last night. It was my first time trying it and we decided to order a few things from the NB bar menu. We got the date grilled cheese and the cumbrae beef sliders. There were very few dates actually in the grilled cheese and when the sliders came I took a bite and my beef was VERY pink and looked undercooked. We cut open the second slider to check and it also wasn't cooked properly so we let one of the restaurant. Rather than cooking a new one they brought back the sliced up and half bitten beef patty and just attempted to cook it more and reassemble the slider. 

In addition our server was not attentive at all and only visited our table to take our initial orders and beyond that we constantly had to get the attention of other waiters to help us. And it was not busy at all, there were only about 4 tables occupied in our area. 

On top of all this they did not register that I had showed up for my reservation on open table and therefore I did not even get any open table points for this dreadful experience! 

For a high end restaurant that is not cheap I was SO DISAPPOINTED and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious to see what all the fuss was about...

In my opinion, the décor was nothing out of the ordinary, but it was nice they had a coat check. They also had a separate bar area from the tables so might be a good place to hang out with friends for a drink or two (or more). It was very busy but we were quickly seated by friendly staff. Bonus points there. 

Their Winterlicious menu was, well, a Winterlicious menu: portions were a bit small for me (I'm a big eater) and a few dishes might have gone better without (the appetizers which I'm not going to bother with). The tongue and cheek was my fave of the night; meat was very tender and flavours were just right. The portion was spot on; had it been more it might have been a bit too much tongues and cheeks. The grilled seabass was cooked to perfection; not dry at all and the sauce was flavourful. Might be a dish to try if you're a fish fan. The apple crumble was pretty good, not too sweet or sour for the apples, and the ice cream went really well. Their clementine sorbet was pretty 'refreshing' - would be a nice treat in the summer. However... it reminded me of the green tea ice cream you get at Japanese all you can eats... having said, you could've given a bigger scoop or at least used a better looking bowl to serve it in (just a suggestion).

It wasn't really worth the $45 but it was worth a visit to say 'I've been there', not necessarily somewhere you would go often. It's a nice place to try if there are seasonal/event menus going on, but other than that there are other restaurants in the area..."}
{"text":"I got a gift card to Nota Bene and decided to cash it in during Winterlicious. I was eager to try this high end restaurant with my boyfriend. It was a three course meal and we both chose different plates that suited our palate.

Although I could probably make it at home, I enjoyed the Quinoa, Wild Rice, and Squash Salad. It was sweet and much different that a plain old salad. I had the East Coast Fish Pie for my main entree. It was similar to a Chicken Pot Pie but with fish. The pie was slightly bland but I still liked it. Lastly, the Double Chocolate Fudge Brownie wrapped up the meal nicely because it wasn't too filling.

The only complaint I had, which I guess was my fault, was their $4 bottled water. I thought that when they offered bottled water at the beginning of the meal, it was going to be free. Since that is the assumption when you go to any restaurant usually. My jaw dropped when I saw the $8 price tag for the two bottled water we have asked for (still and sparking). $8 for water!! I could have gotten something else much more worth it for $8! After this incident, I will remember to ask for \"tap water\" the next time I am in a fancy restaurant.

Overall, aside from the water incident, I really enjoyed the quality of food at Nota Bene. The restaurant interior design wasn't exciting in my opinion. I wished it looked nicer for a high end restaurant. But even so, I still recommend Nota Bene for some delicious (and expensive) meals."}
{"text":"Was there for winterlicious and had one of the good, worthy meals. Great food all in all but really good desserts. Portions were generous too. Left feeling quite full. Great service and will most likely go back."}
{"text":"The food was perfectly adequate, nothing special  -- halibut, the Friday lobster pasta special, toffee pudding, wild blueberries and lemon curd.

The service was almost too quick.  Our waitress -- a woman in her late 20's -- kept referring to my 50+ year old husband as \"dear\".  Maybe this is a Toronto mannerism but it certainly seemed more than a bit off."}
{"text":"I have been for the 10th time in 3 years there as this is clearly one of my favorites, inviting my friends, family, groups up to 8 people...
 
...but I have to say that the service was clearly not as good as it used to be, the waitress was not classy or trying to be nice, I have been given a poor table just at the kitchen door while all the tables besides and against the wall have remained empty all evening long, and this made me realize about one thing... there is no attempt to identify or satisfy regular customers.

Ushers, waitresses change too often and there is no way a familiar customer can be tagged and considered a little bit more than a one-time diner. Both are important for sure, especially in such a good place, but it made me leave unhappy for the first time ever from this place... I hope this is not because the service is really getting poorer and  that this was only bad luck., as I will return of course, but perhaps for the last time if this end up being the same type of uneven experience...

there is a need for a couple of real maitres d'hote there, who would stay for a few years at least and not only a couple of months."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicous, so it may or may not reflect regular menu ratings. Firstly, I would like to say that I am not exactly a food connoisseur and that my standards are relatively low. I love eating though. On with my review...

For my appetizer my friend and I selected the roast duck salad and seafood salad. The seafood salad was not explicitly written in the menu and it was introduced to us by our server. The duck salad was good, the duck was similar to Hong Kong style BBQ Duck with a crispy skin and juicy duck breast meat. It isn't as salty as the ones HK style, which is a definitely plus. The salad itself was daikon with mint and other herb greens mixed in. We picked those out because the flavour was rather strong and it dominated the flavouring of the dish. The seafood salad was good with calamari rings and mussels. Very tasty, especially the salad dressing.

Main course we chose the whitefish and the dirty burger. The burger was good since we were able to have it medium rare, more places in Canada should do this. The egg inside added moisture to the already moist burger and the fries were done well. Great dish. The white fish was also good, not overdone. The flavour was good, also quite good.

Dessert, you should definitely choose the walnut choice. I don't recall the name of the dish but the combination of the warm cake, cold ice cream and caramel hazelnut glaze was amazing. Our other dessert was the pina colada and it was good but defiantly the cake took the cake!

Overall we were impressed by the food and would go again!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time visiting here actually and it's still one of my favorite places to go. The restaurant has great ambiance. It's so pleasant to walk into from all the hustle and bustle of the city outside. The staff are always kind and welcoming. I guess I had mentioned in passing that we were visiting for a special occasion, and without even requesting anything they showered us with congratulations and a lovely large piece of dark chocolate with \"congratulations\" written beautifully on it. The staff are also very attentive and were prompt to serve us and get our bill in the end.

In regards to the food, my favorite is the cavatelli pugliese. The mushroom in it is so good. My family also ordered their burger and said it was amazing, so there's that. The pricing in my opinion is spot on with the quality and food service. Highly recommend this amazing restaurant in the heart of downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Thank's to Natalie T.'s UYE, I finally came to Nota Bene! 

I had the Jennifer's Burger ($22), with caramelized onions and blue cheese with fries on the side. The burger might not look all that big, but the patty seems to be handmade and is extremely thick with sauce and herbs for flavouring directly in the patty, which made it tasty and filling. The caramelized onion was the perfect pairing for the burger (no vegetables inside) but I wasn't a huge fan of the blue cheese. Next time I'd ask for it without or with substitution. I asked for the burger in medium and it's a lot redder on the inside than I had expected, partly because the burger was so thick. It didn't taste raw though.  I don't have much to say about the fries on the side, since I'm not a fries person.

I had the opportunity to try the duck salad (REALLY GOOD) and the rabbit pappardelle, which was really flavourful. 

Very enjoyable meal with very good service. I'm not entirely sure the high price tag is justifiable though, as average entree price was about $30."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicous lunch. The food was good for the most part (especially the cavatelli pugliese which was to die for), but what soured my experience was the overall attitude of our server. Going by how the older patrons were treated, it seemed like only people over the age of 30 were treated with friendliness and respect? Our server just gave me the impression that she didn't want to serve us and was only doing the bare minimum... Don't know if I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Had very high expectations of Nota Bene given the critic and user reviews. And as much as I had hoped to write a positive review, I have to be honest. 

Hamachi ceviche - bland in general and overpowered by lime. The sprinkle of corn nuts was just plain wrong. Perhaps an attempt to be inventive, failing miserably. Yucatan Soup - watered down and souless. Beef ribs - meh. Far too fatty in a not-so-special sauce. Rabbit soffritto - rich and savory but too 'gamey' for my taste. Most memorable part was the horrible stomachache I had all night. 

On a slightly more positive note, the highlight of our meal was the brownie and banana ice cream dessert. Heavenly. Service was good too. But won't be back. :-("}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was the washroom! not overly impressed. I had a pasta dish. The noodles weren't cooked to my liking and it had too many pine nuts in the flavour. My friend got a burger and said it was to die for, and the other friend got a steak which was so juicy and delicious... so stick to meat with this place!

servers are very knowledgeable and attentive with no attitude"}
{"text":"We went there for summerlicious's dinner. Service is very good. The dessert trifle tastes delicious. But I am not a fan for their starter and main course.

For the  main course I ordered steak, I could taste that the meat was very good, and is cooked very well. But I really cannot bear the sause, the sauce tastes weird, honestly smells like soap. For the starter, I ordered crispy duck salad, the duck was very tasty, but I'm not a fan of mint leaf. 

Although I would not go again to this place, but recommend people who love mint leaf to go there, it is a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Service here is always top notch... 

When I decide to split my Jennifer's Burger ($22) with a fellow yelper, I thought the Kitchen is going to cook the burger and give us an extra plate and we just split that in half ourselves... but instead we were served with our own mini burger and fries with no extra cost! +1 star!

The burger is cooked medium rare as I requested... charred outside but pink and juicy inside!

The 2 separate sides: onion rings and grilled Brussels sprouts are both really good... and I don't even like Brussels sprouts usually.

I also tried other items that my fellow dinner mates ordered: Crispy Duck Salad, Hamachi Ceviche, Rabbit Pappardelle, Pecan Butter Tart and Clementine Sorbet.

Services excellent as always and we all got our separate bills even my burger and side all split in half...no calculation needed at all!

Thanks Natalie T for organizing and Nota Bene for having us (complimentary Charcuterie platter!)... I definitely will be back again!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my girlfriend's birthday dinner.  Service was great and the food were something that you have never tried before, in a good way. It was a great atmosphere to host birthday dinners. You'll enjoy the fine dining experience but be sure to come with some extra bucks!"}
{"text":"This is my second trip to Nota Bene; my first trip, where I first tried the Jennifer's Stilton Brisket Burger ($22, including fries), predated my Yelp membership.  I remembered that it was a juicy burger bursting with flavour that looked small on the outside, but was extremely thick and was best appreciated by eating it layer by layer (because if you ate it like you eat a McDonald's burger, every thing will fall out and drip down your clothes... not pretty at all.) So when Natalie T. organized a UYE to try the Jennifer, I jumped at the invitation both to promote it as well as to try something else on the menu.  (And besides, it's near my main stomping grounds... so why not?)

I started out with the Crispy Duck Salad ($15)--the duck was pleasantly crunchy, although I wasn't quite sure what to make of the slaw; did they dress the slaw in lemongrass, or cilantro? It felt a little on the soapy side...

Since I've already tried the Jennifer once, I decided to take a stab at the Roasted Sea Scallops ($28).  I really loved how the scallops were roasted at the correct consistency and not overcooked, and the flavour wasn't overpowering either.

It was also very nice of Jennifer T. and Tara E. to order onion rings and roasted brussels sprouts for the table as side dishes; the onion rings were skinny, crispy and not greasy at all, and the brussels sprouts is starting to make me seriously rethink about how to prepare them at home.  Forget about boiling 'em; I'm seriously going to roast those babies in an oven...

For dessert, I was hesitating between the signature toffee pudding with spotted dick ice cream ($12) and their new pecan butter tart with buttermilk ice cream (forgot the price, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was $12).  I eventually settled on the butter tart (since that didn't have any raisins, and I HATE raisins).  The buttermilk ice cream was tangy, but I wish I didn't decimate all of it before digging into the butter tart--which had a flakier crust than most thick, shortbread-style crusts that I've had in other butter crusts, and had a rather overly sweet filling.

I'll go to Nota Bene sometime again, although \"sometime again\" might not be in the next few months because, let's face it, the prices are not for the faint of heart.  

Once again, hats off to Natalie for organizing the event!
(Edited the review to reflect that Jennifer and Tara ordered the dishes.  Once again, thank you so much for your generosity!)

(Note: Menu prices are from the Nota Bene Web site as of February 28, 2012 unless otherwise stated.  The actual prices may vary.)"}
{"text":"As our previous day's lunch was less than $20 between the two of us, I decided to test my boss's budget by bringing her to the fancy-pantalons Nota Bene. Lunch was amazing. We split a plate of roasted brussel sprouts which were sprinkled with little tempura flakes. For my main I got the lobster salad, sans bacon, which was abundant with avocado and the most amazing stilton cheese I've ever tasted. So delicious and quite filling.

Service as to be expected, was impeccable, and the lounge is a perfectly passable spot for a quick business lunch. I gotta get people to take me here more often."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Nota Bene based on it making it into the top100 restaurants this year. One word: over-rated.

The food was good, but it was definitely over-priced and servings were on the smaller side. It was not mind-blowing by any stretch of the imagination.

Pros: good sunchoke purée, service was excellent, desserts were at level expected and deliciously well done, fish cooked perfectly

Cons: pasta dishes, price."}
{"text":"Well... the $22 Jennifer's Stilton Brisket Beef Burger was.. o.k.

I'm almost ashamed that I went to such a nice restaurant to order something from the menu that was clearly a \"we have something for someone very picky who doesn't want anything on on our menu'.  

I gazed longingly at the other items on the menu that were so appealing, but alas, I was at a burger event, and so I had the burger.  Kitty style:  no bun,  with ketchup, no bleu cheese.

This hockey puck of meat (see what I did there, cause I'm in Canada now!) arrived with a side of gorgeous carmelized onions.  The presentation was nice, and the fries were good- would have been better with truffle oil.  

The burger was an interestingly large italian meatball.  That's the only way I can describe it.  Randomly large morsels of parsley and spices were visibly evident, and distracting.  I was not impressed, and took more than half of it home to the dog.  When packed to go they only packed the burger, not my left over fries, or onions (which I really wanted for a salad the next day).

I WILL come back though for the real menu which just looks so inviting.

Minus an extra star because my st. germain and sprite was $12.  C'mon Toronto, you're not New York."}
{"text":"Best thing about Nota Bene is the food and room. Had the tuna and octopus, which were both excellent. The staff was helpful but absent of personality. The crowd was mostly business folks hitting the big reds wines - par for the course on a wednesday in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love the service at the nota bene- seriously, I had two wait-staff who were very attentive. Love the modern classic atmosphere and the location is so conveniently located near the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts! :)"}
{"text":"First I'd like to point out that the staff here is outstanding and friendly. The place had a nice look and feel of a upscale restaurant.  My tuna tar tar was very yummy and had a nice presentation.  I also had the chicken Asian salad that was absolutely delicious. The reason I'm giving 4 stars vs 5 is the price and portion size. Food size to small for the big price tag."}
{"text":"My bf and I had an amazing dinner here! I cannot rave enough about this place! I loved the atmosphere and the romantic setting. My bf couldn't have picked a nicer restaurant in Toronto to surprise me with! We both opted to choose the summer pre-fixed menus. We both had the crisp duck salad. So glad we decided to each get it instead of getting two different ones and then sharing it because the crisp duck salad was amazing! Probably one of the best salads I've ever had in my life! Everything in it tasted amazing! As for entree, I had the pork chops and it was good! Warm and juicy and flavorful. Good til the last bite! My bf had the burger and he liked it. The egg yolk squirted onto his nice white dress shirt (yikes!) when he took his first bite. Our awesome server happened to see what happened and brought over a little club soda to help bring the stain out! How amazing was our server?! Kudos to him! We forgot his name. :( For dessert I had the sticky toffee pudding which was delicious and a perfect ending to my meal. The bf had niagara strawberry gelato and he enjoyed it. I really liked this place - the food, the ambiance, our amazing server, everything!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Nota Bene for a long while now, but never really had a chance to till recently. I made a reservation through opentable for 7:15 pm. Upon arrival, I was told that they cancelled my reservation, but I could still have the table till 9. I was quite perplexed by the cancellation, but at least we still had a table albeit with the time constraint. 

To start the meal, we had some bread with olive oil. I didn't particularly like this type of bread. But by habit, I naturally gobbled up a lot of it. I should really start practicing self control and stop filling up on bread before a meal.

As our starter, my boyfriend and I split the cavatelli pasta ($16) with truffle-scented mushroom bolognese. Personally, I thought the pasta was a little undercooked, but that mushroom bolognese was rich and luscious. I really enjoyed that bold punch of earthy flavours. I just wished that the pasta was cooked a little more. 

My boyfriend ordered an 8 oz grass-fed beef tenderloin ($42), cooked medium. The steak was pretty enjoyable, although not as good as the one from Jacobs & Co. Nevertheless, this steak was still delicious and completely satisfying.

I love gourmet burgers, so I couldn't pass up on ordering Jennifer's Stilton beef brisket burger ($22), served with pommes frites. Ketchup, mustard, and mayo are provided on the side. I love it when my burger is cooked medium rare, and this one was perfect! The patty was so juicy that I made quite a mess trying to pick it up with my hands to eat it. In fact, the juice from the meat is seeping through the bottom bun, and I just loved that! The burger was marvelously flavourful and definitely one of the best that I've had. I barely ate any fries (thanks to the bread), so not much to comment on those. 

For dessert, I wanted to try Nota Bene's sticky toffee pudding, but unfortunately my boyfriend is not a huge fan of toffee. So I compromised by settling with an apple galette ($12) with wild blueberries, and served with vanilla ice cream. The galette reminded me an apple pie, but no complaints from me since I love apple pies. I wished the scoop of vanilla ice cream could've been slightly bigger. 

All in all, I had a wonderful meal at Nota Bene, and I definitely want to come back another time to try their onion rings. I spotted them at several tables and they looked absolutely fabulous!"}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here having met Mr. Lee at a cooking event. I remember his food from a previous outing and was impressed.
As everyone has noted, the room is very nice, spacious and very elegant. The three of us ordered and waited....and waited..........and waited! I think you are getting the message.
The apps were good, just good. In a room like this I was expecting WOW! My senses were ready, my palate primed, but the food fizzled. Just the sound of the Big Eye Tuna had my mouth watering. Well presented but lacking the favours I was looking for, clean and elegant were not to be found. Ok, we are ready to move on. Now the entrees. After much discussion (which is code for fighting over who was going to order what) we selected the Halibut and the Rabbit.
Both again were well presented but there was something missing, again the WOW was no where to be seen. (The 3rd in our trio was too busy playing with his Blackberry to enjoy his food....idiot!) 
Would I go back? Possibly, but I think I will cast my fishing line into other waters in the City before I give this a 2nd try."}
{"text":"Giving this a 4 star based on service, spirit and wine selection . Food is nice and upscale but as a qualifier I travel extensively and tend to seek out the best restaurants, so would have given a 3-3.5. Ask for Alex at the bar. Very knowledgable and about the food, spirits and wine. I am from Austin and was pleased to see Tito's but he guided me toward a Barolo that was a perfect march for the meal.  Nice atmosphere though happy hour is slow but it picks up."}
{"text":"Came in with a high expectation, left the place feeling \"it's 'aight\". 

SERVICE: Our waitress was very friendly. She's attentive but not annoying (you know what I mean). Plus 1 star for service.

DECOR: Modern minimalism. Boring table setting (no centre piece, just a plain white table cloth). No star for decor.

DRINKS: cocktails are expensive. I got the Nota Bene signature cocktail for $14. It's alright -- it's similar to what I've had at Milestones. The boyfriend had a pint of sapporo, which came with his Wagyu Beef Burger order. Minus 1 star for pricey drinks!

APPETIZER: we shared the Lobster Salad. Boy, this one was great. The lobster chunks were huge and fresh. The bacon bits were bacon cubes (not the pre-packaged ones). Loved the avocado chunks as well. It's pretty filling -- the entire portion was perfect for lunch and perfect to share as an appetizer. Plus 1.5 stars for Appy.

ENTREE: I got the brisket beef burger and the boyfriend got their infamous wagyu beef burger. THEY WERE ALRIGHT. The patties were juicy and tender, even though his wagyu patty was definitely undercooked. The side fries were nothing special (we were expecting sweet potato fries). Overall, we'd rather go to a \"gourmet burger\" place, like Craft's or Acme, instead of spending $40 on a burger. Plus 0.5 star for expensive burgers!

DESSERT: Of course I had to try the Toffee Pudding with Spotted Dick ice cream. This thing was rich but oh so yummy! I'm not a sweet tooth person, but I loved it. Plus 1 star for anything with a funny name like Spotted Dick ;)

Our tab came out to be $150 (incl. tips and taxes). Will not go back."}
{"text":"I was there with a recommendation from AMEX, so they served us with the complimentary charcuterie board. I would say that I had pretty high expectations for this restaurant but some things that occurred left me in slight dismay. :(

When we were seated, the servers took a while to bring us our menus and they weren't very attentive. I'm not criticizing the service as I've only been there once, but it wasn't a 10/10 for me... More of a 7/10

- the server knocked the bottle over and spilled water over our table
- there were no sommeliers there to offer us suggestions
- checkups and water refills were rare and happened perhaps twice throughout the night (we had to ask for them several times, even though it wasn't a busy night)
- there was a slight hint of arrogance from the hostesses to the waitresses

The food itself was okay, very flavourful. Perhaps I have strong taste buds but artichokes were a bit on the salty side. The charcuterie board was amazing though and paired off really well with the wine we got. The scallops were also done well, and my friend really enjoyed his veal. Overall, it's okay but I wouldn't take this over the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Just okay. We came here the other night for their Summerlicious menu and while the food was nothing to complain about, it wasn't great either. 

To start we tried their tuna tartare. It was presented in a glass bowl mixed with watermelon and soba noodles. Love all the ingredients in this dish but perhaps it was sitting in the kitchen too long...it was a bit of a soggy appetizer. The soba noodles were refreshing and flavorful but the rest of the dish was otherwise bland. 

For the entree I went with their Charcoal Grilled Flat Iron Steak. I loved the sweet corn succotash that came with this dish! Unfortunately, the meat was under-cooked. I asked the waiter for it to be cooked medium rare but it definitely came out as rare. Not a big deal but surprising for such a fancy establishment.The chimichurri gave it a bit of spice and although you aren't given a ton of meat, I was full afterwards. My favourite part was definitely the desert. Their mango sorbet is perfect for summer and the tapioca pearls added something extra to the dish."}
