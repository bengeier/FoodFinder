{"text":"Do not be fooled by the silly French name; this place masterfully combines authenticity, quantity, and affordability. If you're looking for a place in South Shore that approximates the mainland dining hall experience, this is it."}
{"text":"They are situated in food court in a rundown mall. Not a place to impress your date. Most of the menu is in Mandarin I guess. Cheap prices. Green tea from leaves. Wonton soup was fine. Noodles seemed homemade. Many asian patrons. I didn't know what I was ordering. Not bad. It would take a couple of visits to figure out what they serve. I like eat new foods. If only I read mandarin."}
{"text":"Total de la facture incluant une boisson et la taxe 10$. Les nouilles sont fait maison, c'est simple et délicieux. Ça vaut le détour au centre d'achat! La clientèle majoritairement asiatique me laisse croire que ça doit être pas si mal question saveur, sinon authenticité."}
