{"text":"Tried sesame inn since our friend said it was a great chinese restaurant.  The seafood hot and sour soup was great though they used crab sticks instead of real crab. Cuisine has sushi, thai, and Americanized chinese food. I ordered the king palace pad Thai which is good but not great. I agree with the other reviewer, you prob can get the Americanized chinese cuisine for cheaper at a hole-in-the-wall take-out place for cheaper but you're paying for the ambience (which is similar to pf change). 4 star since the food is good and the price isn't bad. Servers are attentive. Maybe a bit better than empire palace but less chinese dish options at first glance on the menu."}
{"text":"Takeout service lacking. First concern seems to be on processing the volume of takeout - just hope you don't get lost in the shuffle. Our order was more than 30 minutes late. Of course when we got home most of our dishes were luke warm or cooler - we did not order any sushi. Strongly suggest avoiding for takeout."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for years, sometimes several times in a month, and until recently I've had nothing but good things to say about our  meal and the service.  Unfortunately, over the past few months I've had more bad experiences than good ones - mainly with the food preparation and kitchen.  My takeout and dining room orders have been incorrect a few times in the last month and my food has been slightly burnt at least twice. We have always found the servers to be capable and the management to be welcoming, so we have been forgiving.  Today however, we were treated disrespectfully by management/ownership when we spoke to them about how 2 of the 3 entrees we ordered weren't made correctly and that this was the latest of many mediocre experiences there.  They took our money, offered no apology and made us feel unwelcome.  We are going to try one of the other restaurants in the area the next time we decide to get Chinese food."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, and I have been coming to this sesame inn for a long time. The food is consistently good. They have a really good lunch special soup or egg roll with a main course with rice it is a good price for the quality. I normally get the Kung Pao chicken or the amazing chicken which is like a General Tso's with white meat. Also the egg rolls are great and so is the Avocado salad. I don't eat sushi but since they started serving it my grandpa gets it every time so it must be pretty good since he one of the pickiest eaters I know. Also a great place for cocktails they don't seem watered down like some other places. Hope this helps, give them chance. :)"}
{"text":"decent chinese food

fast service

can request white meat with chicken dishes - a plus for the kids

honey walnt shrimp is good"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Everything I have tried here has been incredible.  I usually end up getting some of their delicious sushi (i particularly enjoy the Napoleon roll), and their amazing chicken is very aptly named, yum!  My boyfriend and I find ourselves at this restaurant quite frequently.  There are 4 locations and we always go to the North Hills spot.  We tried the station square restaurant once and it was disappointing.  If you're looking for some great Chinese food and/or sushi, definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but easily the best Chinese restaurant in the North Hills."}
{"text":"Food is very good and consistent!   Fast delivery. We have  tried a variety of foods, all have been good.   Always get delivery, have not ate inside restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great atmosphere, food, and service.  This is the place for Chinese food and sushi."}
{"text":"The sesame chicken lunch special had chunks of crispy chicken in a teriyaki-like sauce. My friends got the shrimp with vegetables and the tofu with vegetables. I tasted both and they were good. It comes with soup or egg roll. My friend thinks the Mexican waiter is very friendly and our food was served quickly. I want to go back."}
{"text":"Love the food. Never disappointed. We go to eat here a lot and tried all the dishes. Our Company Christmas dinner is held here."}
{"text":"This is yet another pitiful claim for Chinese food...everything is greasy and entrees are loaded with sugar mixed with salty soy sauce. --- General Tso Chicken is NOT, has never been, a part of Chinese cuisine. Any restaurant that lists it in the menu is a flag that such restaurant is not Chinese--- This place is doubly pitiful to claim Chinese restaurant when about a 3rd of the menu are Thai entrees, which are equally dismal. --- If you want real Chinese and can travel, go to Chinatown in NYC or SF or LA."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Ordered Amazing Chicken and Moo Shi Beef.  Food arrived after a considerable wait.  Both entrees were cold.  When we brought this to the attention of the waitress, she said the cook put it in take out containers.When she finally found the food, she dumped it on a plate and served us. She said she would microwave it to heat it up.  If we wanted microwaved food, we would not have come to a restaurant.  Very disappointed in their food, service and management.  Better off eating at this place for lunch, never again for dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a good variety. Really nice atmosphere too. It's open feeling with a lot of large windows and even when there's lots of people the noise level is very comfortable. Very accommodating to people sharing too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very gorgeous on the inside, and the atmosphere is great for everything from business meetings to family dinners to reunions. The lobby is well decorated, and the setup is very spacious - quite elegant, especially considering the actual building is more difficult to find and located inside a Toyota dealership! The food, however, is entirely Americanized Chinese food. It's not bad, but don't come here expecting to eat authentic Chinese food if you're familiar with it. We ordered the mapo tofu and the garlic eggplant, two staples of vegetarian dining in Americanized Chinese places. The eggplant was decent, as was the brown rice, but the mapo tofu was rather boring, cubes of plain tofu in a generic brown sauce with a small bit of the infamous peas and tiny carrot cubes and mushroom slices that must be frozen/canned from the food distributor. Definitely not a real mapo tofu.

Anyway, the service was decent, so the take-home point is, definitely come here for the nice atmosphere or if you like Americanized Chinese food. Don't come here if you want authentic Chinese - but hey, we're in America, and those places are few and far between, especially in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Excellent food, huge huge quantities. If it's just two ppl I suggest getting one dish and extra rice. My husband and I can eat the left overs for two nights. 
Loved the General Tso's chicken! Mangolian beef was yummy too. This is now a favorite Chinese spot for us. SUPER satisfied!
Also, they give you a pot of yummy oolong tea that's complementary! Never seen that anywhere before."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Busy trade, which is a good sign. We had the almond chicken which was excellent. We also had the general Tsos which has spoiled me for all other general tsos. The chicken was so delicious and crisp on the outside, yet moist and tasty on the inside! Worth the drive if you are not nearby."}
{"text":"I haven't read through the other reviews and don't know the reasons behind them not all being 5 stars but if I could give more than 5 I would.  This is the best Chinese food I've had including other cities and states.  I get that it's 'Americanized or Westernized' Chinese food or whatever, but my taste-buds don't know that.  Everything is delicious, you can't go wrong with what you order.  That being said, my usual is the Amazing Chicken because it is simply amazing.  But I know that everything on the menu is delicious because my boyfriends always orders different things and I always try it.  We usually get fried dumplings as an appetizer and they're awesome!"}
{"text":"Sadly, what once was a great restaurant is no longer even mediocre. Our family has gone here for years. On our recent visit we noticed this locally known \"Chinese\" restaurant now serves Chinese, Thai, Japanese, sushi, and more. You can't be good at it all, and Sesame Inn proves that. Our meal was $50 for a kid and two adults. The kids menu serves fries and chicken fingers (at a Chinese restaurant). I have spent a lot of time in China and Thailand and the food reminds me of a cheap greasy buffet. Just look at the amount of oil and grease in the curry picture I posted. I will tell you, my stomach was in knots and did flips for days. I had to drain the grease out of each bite. My partner's dish had so much salt in it and it spiked her already high blood pressure. Maybe the chef dropped a box of salt in by accident. Another issue was our service. The guy must've had PMS. He was so irritated and never checked to see how our meal was. He was snapping and didn't seem to want to be there. On a previous visit he was nice. Maybe he also doesn't like it anymore. This place is robbing people dry. Find another restaurant fast! Don't waste your money! Or kill your stomach or waist line! Any health concerns? Don't dine here. I'm sad to say our family has been coming here for years but just ended our memories dining here."}
{"text":"I just moved to the North Hills and had always greatly enjoyed the Sesame Inn in Mt. Lebanon.  I decided to order take out from this location and the issues started from the moment they picked up the phone. For starters, the woman who answered asked me several times if I knew what location I was ordering from. I did not understand what she was saying due to the language barrier and tried to be very polite, however her growing irritation and blatant rudeness was overwhelming. The few questions I asked were met with aggression. 

When I went to pick it up, the location was hard to find. It is virtually in a Toyota dealership. The entrance and ambiance is very chic. I picked up my food and asked the woman helping me if the chicken and broccoli was in a brown sauce. She did not initially respond at all and said a minute later that it was. I asked for extra soy sauce, which apparently irritated her as well. When I got home and opened my bag there were NO soy sauce packets and 2 duck sauces. Good thing I asked for \"extra\" or I would have had none. The chicken was goupy and chewy; not up to the standard I was used to from the Lebo location. I do not need to feel intimidated when paying for food and will not be going back."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in the 'burgh.  Try the \"amazing chicken\" (General Tso's but all white meat).  Despite having dined here numerous times, I only think I received an improperly cooked/seasoned dish one time, and they corrected the problem (probably a new cook).  The lunch specials are great."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give negative stars but, it looks like you can't so I will give you a description of our take out experience. We ordered a dinner meal and a sushi app. The app wasn't great. We ordered a spicy salmon roll, not a tuna roll which is what we received.  That wasn't even the worst part. My wife ordered the Mongolian beef which she was underwhelmed with.  The worst part of the experience was that I got violently ill instantly after just a few bites of the general tso chicken.  I was not upset but we wanted to call and notify they restaurant in case others had similar issues. No, instead we were told to go to the hospital and get checked out and if it was food poisoning then they have insurance to cover. No sorry. No apologies. Just talk to our insurance company. So this must not be in an isolated incident since they have a canned response to tell customers.  Thank you for the last meal I will ever have at sesame inn. Enjoy your food poisoning insurance claims."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere...minus the entrance being in a car lot...didn't feel very zen.  However, the food was great.  Probably the first Chinese place that I asked for super spicy and got my fact burnt off...a sincere thank you!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular for a quite long time but yesterday's experience was very disappointing. The waiter spilled the sauce all over the table and did not care to apologize at all--instead, he kept blaming me and the rest of the party for moving the dishes. The hot tea was never refilled or served on time. When the whole party got out of the restaurant he even frowned upon all of us for the amount of tip he got from us. 
Furthermore, the food was not authentic Chinese at all. We ordered one whole Peking Duck but it wasn't even close to the Peking Duck I've had in Philadelphia, D.C., and China! It was honestly my first time trying something other than the mixed vegetables and general Tso's chicken but it was again quite disappointing. 
Never going back to spend money only to get frowned on by a waiter!"}
{"text":"Gud place, silent with slow music in the background. Not too expensive and food tastes really gud. Very few restaurants have Thai and Chinese together and this is one of them"}
{"text":"Stopped in there today had the Amazing Chicken which is general tso's with real white meat chicken.  It was delicious and some of the best Chinese food I've ever had and will def go back.  It was $9 for the lunch portion with choice of rice and either soup or egg roll.  Well worth the price and the portion was a good size."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Very clean and the staff is very nice. The food is excellent.  It makes u realize how lucky we r to have a Chinese restaurant that has a great selection, makes awesome sauces... I am in love with capital chicken.  I even got my parents eating here and they never eat Chinese and they both love the walnut chicken.  The chicken egg rolls are great."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, the atmosphere of the restaurant was quiet and welcoming. I loved the large Asian style umbrellas hanging from the ceiling in different tiers. My boyfriend and I went to this place as he'd been before and enjoyed the food. I ordered the General Tso's chicken as I was starving and ready to maul a plate of food. I ordered first, and as Joe ordered his food, he asked for white meat chicken. \"Why ask for white meat chicken? This place charges $15 for an entree,\" I thought to myself. Well, indeed a place can charge whatever the hell they want per plate and still use chicken cuts I wouldn't put in my own dishes at home. I realized the meat in my order was dark, gummy, and stringy, however I figured I'd muddle through it and enjoy the crisp and sauce. I made it about a third of the way through my dish before encountering a gooey, gummy, ball of fat. I chewed until I thought I could stomach the bite, swallowed, and nearly gagged as part went down my throat and part was stuck on the back of my tongue.

I immediately felt sick to my stomach and the server, who I gathered may have been an owner, asked me if everything was alright. He was very sweet and attentive, so I didn't have the heart to tell him the General Tso's (standard order) had me on the verge of regurgitating my entire meal. I'm glad we had hot tea and that I had some wonton soup as an appetizer. Can I also mention there was shredded lettuce (not cabbage or the asian slaw) in my soup? Literally; shredded lettuce from a Subway sandwich should not be stewing in my bowl of soup.

I was happy my wonton soup was tepid at best, as it was easy to eat, but after I imagined what the chicken likely looked like before they battered and fried it, I thought to myself that the soup was likely under-temperature for what is passable by the ACHD.

I'd love to go back, but my stomach turns as I'm typing this review. Give it a shot, but if ordering something with chicken, by all means, request that it is White Meat. When they tell you \"oh that's the amazing chicken\" you'll know that the other type they serve is actually the pig slop."}
{"text":"Finally got to order some takeout from here as my usual go-to Chinese restaurant wasn't open. We had an order of general tso's and moo goo gai pan, both with white rice.

I always get nervous trying a place as takeout as opposed to dining in for the first time, especially when I can't sit down and immediately eat it. That being said, this was some of the best general tso's I've ever had. Perfectly fried, not overly sweet or spicy.

Only reason I docked them a star is the price, total order was $27 which is not horrible, but the portions won't huge so it felt a little expensive. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant ... Know this, amazing chicken =white meat
General tso = dark meat

Same sauce and crispiness"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, and I have come to this location about every two weeks now for the past 6 months. I have only ordered sushi/sashimi, never the Chinese food but I can say the fish is always extremely fresh, never had an upset stomach. The service has always been good, and the prices are very reasonable. This is close to my house which is an added plus. My only complaint would be that the children's menu is very limited - only 3 plates to choose from but most Chinese restaurants are like this so it's nothing major. Their menu has recently been updated and does not list the sushi boats but they still have them, if you are in the mood for a ton of raw fish on a fun plate ask your server about it."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in years & tonight I wasn't feeling well so decided to order delivery. I ordered the Singapore Rice Noodle & hot & sour soup. 

The only thing more disappointing than the food was the rude manner in which  I was treated by the manager when I called to inform them about the problem with my food. The soup container was only half full & there was ONE mushroom slice & maybe 3 pieces of sliced bamboo shoot. It was pretty pathetic but I had an entire container of mei fun, so I just let it go. 

The mei fun was so dry that the entire container of noodles had seized together into one hard clump. It was dry & tasteless, which is odd because this dish usually has a lovely curry sauce. No flavor. Zero. I transferred it into a mixing bowl thinking that perhaps all of the curry had gone to the bottom. But the only thing at the bottom was a scrambled egg that the cook had burned & they served it to me anyway. It was literally burned & black. 

I called the restaurant to inform them & the manager was very rude & defensive. He said that nobody has ever complained about the Singapore noodle before & that in order for him to say anything to the cooks about it, that I would have to drive it back & return it, that he would need to see it & that he couldn't just take a customer's word on it. WOW! I explained to him that I wasn't asking for my money back - that I just thought as a business owner he would like to know if there was a problem with the food. He continued to argue with me & try to convince me that this bowl of dry noodles & burnt eggs was fine and that unless I provided proof he was not even going to mention it to the kitchen. Wow! This is the last time I give this place my money!"}
{"text":"Be prepared for the hot mustard which is made onsite.  It is not for lightweights .... you will tear up.

I have made my way through the entire seafood menu ... and haven't found anything that I wouldn't reorder.

Joey is my favorite waiter.

I love the wonton and miso soups.  

Lots of parking ... bonus"}
{"text":"I don't often give a negative 1 star review but this will be one.  We stopped here because it had been recommended to us because we wanted Chinese food while in this area of Pittsburgh.  We entered the restaurant at 11:00am.  On Yelp and google, the business Hours say a 10:30am opening. There were four other people in the restaurant at a table.  We waited about 5 minutes and another man came in behind us. 

We waited some more. Then an older woman came to foyer and said  \"Floors are wet. We not ready till 11:30.\"  She was rude and acted that she was inconvenienced.  The thing is the man behind us was able to pick up his to-go order.  I am guessing the kitchen was ready. 

She could have offered to show us to a table and let us wait the 15 more minutes with a complimentary beverage, but she made it seem like we should leave and return at 11:30am. I have no idea who the others in restaurant were but we left and will not be back."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken.  It's a dish. Get it.  It's amazing.  My ultimate favorite dish, and I seriously am still thinking about it 24 hours later. I'm not sure, maybe there's crack in the dish, but the chicken is perfectly cooked, crispy, and perfectly sweet.  The steamed white rice is a good accompaniment for the sweetness of the dish.  It truly is just chicken--no veggies.  The General Tso's chicken is similar but different in a way I can't quite describe.  It's unfortunate that we live near 51 and there's not one near us.  Service is quick, friendly, and food is hot upon pick up.  I could eat here daily, if it weren't so far away."}
{"text":"I try to stop here every time I'm back on the area. It's an upscale Asian place - better than the standard 'Great Wall' type of places that every town has 100 of, but not overly fancy like PF Changs. Most importantly, the food is consistently awesome. I've never had anything here that I didn't love. I stick mostly to the Chinese side of the menu (as opposed to their Thai and sushi offerings), and my favorite dish is the shrimp and Asian eggplant with spicy brown sauce. In fact, my mouth is watering just writing this review....."}
{"text":"This place has great food, don't listen to all the Pittsburgh food hipsters say differently. I have eaten at the various Sesame inn locations for years, it's just as good as the Station square location was. Everyone is always looking for something new, you won't find that here, however you will find excellent versions of all the standard Chinese dishes you'd expect everywhere. The service is top notch, however the older Asian lady who seats you could be a little more pleasant. Get the Amazing duo for a succulent, sweet, and spicy chicken and shrimp dish."}
{"text":"General tso sauce is perfect on chicken or shrimp. All dishes perfectly cooked. The best was the triple delight. The meats in this dish, especially the beef, were tender juicy & amazing. Also food was served in very short time... very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We had lunch yesterday. It's a great deal since it comes with soup or egg roll. Very few Chinese places have a children's portion, so it was nice to see. I had the sushi lunch with 2 maki rolls. The California roll and shiitake mushroom rolls were wonderful. The hot and sour soup was decent. My daughter had the chicken and broccoli, which she didn't like but I did. My dad did not like the general tso chicken. He thought it was too sweet. My grandma had the amazing chicken, which was almost the same thing as his.  

The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The entrance way is welcoming."}
{"text":"Three stars because I've had some truly good meals here. But today it was a one star affair.

I had lunch. The waitress was dismissive and rude. I take it she's acted the same way to many others, since she's frequently mentioned in the reviews here. I got general tso's chicken. A few words about the sauce. You could literally taste the granulated sugar and bite down on it. This turned me off like you couldn't believe. I soaked the rice up in it so it would be less noticeable, but to no avail. It was noticeable. The chicken itself was crunchy and all white meat, which was great, but the sauce really could have been better prepared.

I thought it would be easier to pay the bill and get the hell out of there, since the wait staff was so dismissive. But no. I sat around for ten minutes after I was done eating. Rude waitress comes in \"you done?\", takes away dish. Five minutes pass. Waitress runs through, I try to get her attention. \"Miss? Can I please have my check?\" \"yeah yeah yeah, hold on\" I hear back. Ten minutes. I get my check. \"Do I pay you or at the front desk?\" \"It doesn't matter\" she snaps back. I leave my money on the table and leave. If I had mentioned the bad sauce I can't imagine what her reaction would have been. Go to Bean Curd instead."}
{"text":"Been coming for the last 10 years on Christmas Eve tolerated the service because the food was excellent, it's sad to say that we will have to look for a new tradition  on Christmas Eve and a new Chinese
 restaurant when I am in the North hills.  Split a family of 8 up on Christmas Eve when reservation were made the first week in December. Food was horrible  like we ordered amazing chicken soup with all the sauce on it. Couldn't get a refill on a drink or soy sauce or anything our table need."}
{"text":"The Sesame Inn is probably one of the most consistently delicious Chinese/Asian restaurants in the North Hills, if not Pittsburgh. Service is generally very attentive, and the food, while not remarkably different from cuisine elsewhere, is probably better tasting than almost any comparable restaurant in the area. 

They also have a decent selection of sushi. I've had better elsewhere, and I don't necessarily associate the Sesame Inn with sushi, but it's certainly not bad. 

In short, I haven't left the Sesame Inn unsatisfied. It is basically my go-to Chinese restaurant while in the North Hills, and it beats out many in the city of Pittsburgh as well."}
{"text":"They served my $40 Peking Duck with Mexican tortilla's. They even had the plastic tortilla holder that says \"tortilla's\" on the lid. What an absolute fraud. Duck meat was dry, sauce was just soy reduction. 

I hear they have great General Tso's though!"}
{"text":"I've found it, chinese food that matches my favorite from home in everyway. Today is a happy, joy, joy day !"}
{"text":"I love the Mount Lebanon location. This one, not so much. Something about this location put me into somewhat of a depression and I can't pinpoint the exact reason. I came here for lunch and the restaurant was really clean, but the lack of windows made it really dark, even when it was bright and sunny outside. 

The service was really quick, almost too quick if that's even possible. We ordered and the waitress came out with our soup and egg roll in less than a minute. I can understand the quickness of the soup but the egg roll, it goes to show they probably just have them pre-fried and sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen. I ordered the Chicken with Garlic Sauce and the hubby ordered the Amazing Chicken. The chicken with garlic sauce was sweet and savory, loaded with a lot of veggies. It tasted ok, but a little heavy on the ginger for me. The amazing chicken wasn't all that amazing, according to the husband. It was way too sweet and lacked any vegetables to cut the sweetness. 

Although the service was quick, our waitress wasn't all that friendly. She was straight-forward and did not have a smile on her face at any point. The only staff member to ever smile while we were there was the hostess and perhaps that's why she's the hostess. 

Compared to the Mount Lebanon location, the food seems to taste consistent since the soup and egg roll were identical. The atmosphere could use a refresher and the service could use a friendly smile."}
{"text":"Seems to be going downhill.  Very inconsistent - can be great one day and downright terrible the very next day.  The service is not friendly - there is such a language barrier and they are always in a hurry to point of being downright rude.  The food is so hit or miss it's hard to get behind this restaurant and support it.  We want to like it; but they don't make it easy."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Fast service. I usually find myself there for the lunch specials - call ahead for easy pickup. 

We just had a birthday dinner here with a group of 13. They had a table reserved for us at our request and were allowed to sit as each of us arrived. The waitress offered to split the check without any hassle. We received good attention throughout the meal and didn't have to wait long for our food. There was an added 18% gratuity, but that can be expected at any location with a large party. The quality of the food is better than the \"take-out\" Chinese locations you'll find around town and they offer an upscale yet casual dining area which adds to the experience. 

Tip: Dunking your egg roll in the yellow mustard = bad idea."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese. Pad Thai pretty good..
Sushi specials are very good.
They deliver which we love!"}
{"text":"This place is really pricy for what to me is typical non authentic Americanized Chinese food.  The atmosphere was a bit fancy looking and nice.  However I grade mostly on taste and I'd rather go for $8 tasty hole in the wall take out Chinese over this place.

3 stars because the food wasn't bad it just wasn't any better than cheaper alternative"}
{"text":"Been going here for 9+ years. Prices seem to have gone up. Food is good, but not worth these prices. Also, service not as good as it used to be. They used to let us do an upcharge and get shrimp for kids plate. No longer. Waiters and waitresses are not friendly. The good ones seem to have left. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I was told this place would be amazing. The food was good, I had amazing chicken. The service was very friendly and helpful. 

The environment was very crammed, my back was about a foot from a person in a booth. No room for the waiter to walk past me to help the person behind me. 

Food was good, nothing to brag about. I prefer Silk Road though."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the Burgh! Drinks, appetizers, sushi, dinners, everything is delicious! Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Usually much tastier food than tonight. Perhaps a different chef? Tea was tasteless almost resembling dish water. Kung pao chicken very very salty & not spicy at all. Huge disappointment. I usually love this place. : (. Strong smell of bathroom disinfectant from foyer bathrooms kept wafting past too. Gross. Please make this place good again. I'd hate to lose it."}
{"text":"We celebrated my son's 15th birthday here yesterday, at his request, and we were pleased from start to finish.  There were 7 of us so I called & made reservations- we walked in at 3:55 and were promptly seated at a table set up & waiting for us.  Our waitress brought over menus (I hate when they are already placed on the table before you even get there).  As we were looking it over, a server came around with 2 pots of the complimentary tea and filled our water glasses.  We ordered after a few minutes and sat back & waited...  In probably less than 5 minutes, out come our egg rolls and the Octopus salad we ordered as apps.  The egg rolls were cooked to perfection- the outer shell was as delicate as a spring roll and the inside vegetables still had that crunch.  The chicken egg rolls were devoured before I could get a good look but we ordered another one so they must have been pretty good.  It was me that had ordered the octopus salad and while it wasn't prepared the way I was used to- slightly pickled, left in bigger pieces- this was still nice & fresh octopus with crunchy veggie strings interspersed in a subtle cream type sauce.  That was my only :( in the whole meal and who am I to tell them how to prepare octopus salad...?  

Our entrees came out & they were huge.  My wife ordered Happy Family, I ordered Vegetable Lo Mein (we normally share 2 plates), my dad (who has a very limited grasp on oriental cuisine) played it safe with chicken strips & white rice,my mo ordered Amazing Chicken and my sons ordered Amazing Chicken, Chicken Lo Mein & General Tso's Shrimp.  The Amazing Chicken was my fav of the day.  It had the most delicate breading on it with a slight tangy sauce (reminded me of General Tso's sweetness mixed with the tanginess of Duck Sauce).  There wasn't a single sliver of amazing chicken to put into a to go box.  We ended up splitting our (my wife & mine) leftovers and made 2 work lunches.  

Then at the end of our meal, because I had told the waitress we were celebrating my son's b/d, she brought out a comp. piece of cheesecake with a candle on it and started the Happy Birthday song.  She didn't have to, but that was a very nice touch on their part.  

We've been to a bunch of Chinese restaurants in the area and I think this one gets my vote as the best.  Even over P. F. Changs who some people thing is awesome, my experience is that their food is 'boil-in-a-bag' and pour out onto your plate.  Their sweet & sour chicken was cold & mushy...               

So, in closing... we are DEFINATELY fans if the Sesame Inn just off McKnight Road.  :)"}
{"text":"#1 it is posted on here that Sesame Inn delivers , it says on menu takeout one mind you delivery.

{"text":"Lets be honest, there isnt many half decent Chinese food in Pittsburgh or even Asian food in general.  Also, it pains me to rate a Chinese restaurant that also serves Thai cuisine and Sushi. Its just not right and usually when a restaurant tries to do too many thing at once, they end up sucking at everything.

With that said, Sesame Inn actually has decent Americanized Chinese food, their Thai food is not bad and the sushi is always fresh. And because Pittsburgh is severely lacking in Asian restaurants, I'll give Sesame Inn a pass for doing Chinese, Thai and Japanese (which in normal circumstances screams for me to stay away from).

My favorite thing on the menu is the Singapore Rice noodles. Its a curry flavored noodle dish with chicken, pork and shrimp that makes me crave for more each time I order it."}
{"text":"Always stellar. Food is fabulous and fast. Drinks are always unique and delicious. Have been coming here for years. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This inside second time here now. I love the way it looks inside, and the food is always great! Shout out to Clayton! He was our server both times and we really like him and plan to request him when we come back, and yes, we WILL be back. I love the white tuna, and miso soup. The Szechwan shrimp with fried rice was great too, as well as the shumai."}
{"text":"Put it this way ~ my husband and I won't eat at any other Chinese restaurant in the city.  Always outstanding and consistent.  The Thai menu is fabulous and the chicken and eggplant is to die for."}
{"text":"The best Chinese/ Thai cuisine that I've ever had. I always order the their version of green curry call Keiwain curry. Spice level at the maximum. My husband has the amazing chicken an believe me it is. he orders it mild but is a great dish either way. The view from the restaurant isn't great. It is located in a Toyota dealership. Believe me when I say if you taste the food the outdoor surrounds go away. Best Chinese in Pittsburgh at all of their location. I primarily go to the north side because it is within walking distance but check out the other locations."}
{"text":"I didn't think this place was the greatest for the price. It's slightly better than the hot steamed window take-out joints, but not what you would expect for $10 Kung Pao. I think overrated, but maybe I am biased from dirt cheap great Chinese in NYC."}
{"text":"Well, this is what I will say about Sesame Inn. The food is actually pretty good but for the love of God don't order food for delivery... Ex) Today my wife and I ordered dinner @ 5:43 @ 7:18pm I called them asking them - where is the food? The manager proceeded to tell us the driver drove the our place and the lights were off and no one answered the door - he asked did you guys leave and just come back???? I told him Noooo - we have two lights on - one in the yard and one above the front door. I said the driver must of went to the wrong place. The manager tells me noooo the driver went to my address??? I'm like dude - I've been sitting here binge watching Netflix waiting for food with my wife. What a a$$. Anyway we say well can he come back and how long will it be now? He tells us 30 minutes.... it's already been 90 minutes. We tell him to cancel the order - what a pain - ridiculous. Beware of the delivery... go pick it up. Now starving and in a terrible mood. Thanks Sesame"}
{"text":"Super nice environment for Chinese food! Also do some Thai. Mostly Americanized dishes due to demographics of the community. A bit pricey, but the portion is big!"}
{"text":"Their Amazing Chicken is awesome and its all white meat. Their egg rolls are the best but all of the chicken is all white meat and its all very good. Clean place with lots of space."}
{"text":"My job dispatched me to our North Hills satellite office for the day.  The thing that I hate about this area is it's so car-dependant here.  You have to drive to places two minutes away!  On the other hand, if you're looking for a decent lunch, there are all sorts of good places around here.  

I'm a big fan of Chinese food and fortunately one of my favorite places in the 'Burgh, Sesame Inn, has a place nearby.  They have an extensive list of \"Chef's Specials\" for lunch, so if you like good Chinese, you're bound to find something you'll like.  My tastes run to the basics, so I ordered the Lemon Chicken.  The crispy breading on the chicken wasn't overdone (I.e. I could still taste the chicken) and the meat itself was tender.  

The lunch specials include your choice of eggroll, hot-n-sour soup, or eggdrop soup.  Now I love my eggrolls and the hot-n-sour soup was mighty tempting.  But it'd been awhile since I'd tried the eggdrop soup and believe me, it really hit the spot.  You also get your choice of steamed, fried, or brown rice.  I'm not a fan of fried rice, so yeah I opted for steamed.  

Sesame Inn succeeds at the basics, so if you're in the mood for great, no-surprises Chinese food, then stop in."}
{"text":"Sesame Inn is one of my favorite places for Chinese food. Although I never get takeout here, it is our go-to for sit-down Chinese. Takeout is very popular though. Any time you come, you see hoards of people just waiting for takeout orders. I've had the orange chicken, sesame chicken, and lemon chicken. All are delicious. I've also had the spicy tuna roll, crab rangoons, steamed dumplings, wonton soup and seaweed salad. All of them hit the spot! 

Sesame Inn is very consistent in their quality and the restaurant is much more fancy inside than you'd expect from a Chinese place. It is a great addition to anyone's usual dining spots."}
{"text":"Been dining here for years and are always very pleased with the quality and the service.  We do a mix of dine in, takeout and delivery and I have to say, the delivery service is always fast and efficient.  Great tasting  sushi with a vast selection-- the homemade ginger dressing is the best!"}
{"text":"The service was atrocious here. The waitress was very impatient and didn't seem too happy that we were here. Honestly, it's probably because she isn't use to seeing non-Caucasians dining here. Not only was she impatient she spoke in a tone that was fit for an argument. Perhaps she's one of those crazy tiger moms... So definitely 1 star for her attitude.

The food is typical Chinese-american food. My GF and I did the Sunday brunch, which consists of a soup, eggroll, and entree. We had the general tao's chicken and triple delight. The chicken was good with a bit of crunch and the sauce was light. However, the chicken was served next to a bed of rice and as we're eating the rice soaked up a lot of the sauce. The triple delight had velvety chicken and beef pieces with a few shrimp. The sauce was also light but had good flavor. The veggies in the dish was a bit too raw and wasn't mixed in well with the rest of the ingredients. Overall it's a 3 for food."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place. I visited this location about 5 years ago. Had terrible service from the waitress, we were such an inconvenience for her because she actually had to do her job. The food wasn't great. I tried it again today one last time to see if they got better, but did takeout. I ordered the shrimp \"egg roll\" it was a spring roll, which I love but, it was so greasy and disgusting. I ordered general tso all white meat chicken extra spicy. They only got the all white meat part correct. It was so sweet, disgusting! General tso isn't supposed to be sweet.  Apparently they don't know what spicy and extra spicy means. The crab ragoons the cream cheese was \"nuked\" in the microwave it crumbled as I broke it apart.  I wanted to try the mango roll, spicy California roll with mango and avocado on top. This roll was really good even though it  wasn't spicy California roll. Needless to say I definitely will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"We had the orange shrimp and cashew shrimp it did not taste as fresh as it usually does, the cashew shrimp sauce was thin and watery.  I hope this doesn't become their standard.  High quality and Consistency were always their most attractive qualities.  I'll give it one more try, but first I'll go back to Hunan inn."}
{"text":"Bland Bland Bland. My wife and I had the Amazing Duo chicken/shrimp (red peppers added) and Kung Pao Duo chicken/shrimp (brown sauce). The Amazing Duo was a 6/10. The Kung Pao was a 5/10. 

The Amazing Duo was somewhat enjoyable but still wasn't as sweet as I would have liked and some of the chicken was rubbery. 

The Kung Pao Duo was very, very bland. It wasn't spicy, and it wasn't savory or flavorful, even though it had celery, peanuts, and mushrooms in it. By the way, it had way too much peanuts and celery. These are supposed to complement this dish, not be a main component. I would have told the waiter about the taste, but I had started eating my wife's meal first before and he came over to check on us before I had mine. I ate a little bit of mine over the course of the night, but my wife and I practically finished hers. I told the waiter at the end of the meal how bland mine was while he was packing it up. He went and had the cook \"spice\"  it up before putting it into the to go box. Trying it at home, it's still bland and maybe spiced from a 0 to a 1 lol. The waiter did give us free white rice to take home to eat with our leftovers. 

All in all, I would not eat here again, especially for the price ($18 per meal dinner) and lack of taste and quality. I would rather spend my money at Nikkis Thai Kitchen (yes, it's not Chinese, but the quality is outstanding and it's a favorite restaurant of mine.)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local Chinese place.  I almost only eat here for lunch though because I do think the dinner prices are a little much.  The lunch selection and prices are great. Service is generally very good.  I particularly enjoy the soup dumplings and salt and pepper calamari.  This is the best calamari I have ever had.  It tastes fresh and appears hand breaded.  Far better than the frozen, chewy junk that places like Olive Garden serve.   

I must point out that this is Americanized Chinese/Thai dishes.  Although, the Amazing Chicken is pretty amazing.  The tangy spicy scallops and shrimp are also great!  If I don't order one of these two dishes, I generally order sushi.  I would say they serve average sushi.  Some days it's great, and other days it's just ok.  If you're looking for something fresher and tastier than your local Chinese take out spot, this is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service and my meal.
The waiter took very long to greet us.After we ordered he took forever to bring our drinks and soup.I asked for lettuce to be omitted from my soup but he didn't mark it down so it came with lettuce . Not to mention the soup was not hot neither was my egg roll. Now to the main entree  I ordered shrimp general tso it was ok but the broccoli that was on side was also cold. They were busy which it was brunch time. But this is way I gave them 3 star."}
{"text":"General pso's not so good, not all white meat chicken, no spice at all and a ton of breading. Shrimp lo mein not great either, really needed a lot more sauce/flavor and it literally was just noodles and shrimp, maybe a few pieces of string cabbage but it should have a lot more veggies in it. Won ton soup pretty good. We have ordered from here 5-8x and we won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Sesame Inn is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I've been to the Sesame at a least every day of the week.. for lunch or dinner. This time, we celebrated my Dad's birthday. 

The trick is... go early on Saturday afternoon- no wait. You can make a reservation. Perfect for the whole family. (Total of 9 of us) Including my nieces and nephew. 

To start, I ordered the Wonton Soup. It is delicious- plenty of big wontons. Next, I ordered a California roll to be shared with the table. Their California roll is amazing - my favorite place to grab some sushi. 

For my entree, I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken (with an up charge of $1 for brown rice) this meal is one of the favorites. I also often order the Amazing Chicken - it is also to die for. 

The service that we had was amazing. Our waitress was so patient while the kids ordered their food and she was so friendly. She literally made the dinner experience even better. 

As always, we had a great family outing to the Sesame Inn."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Pittsburgh, I make sure to come here with my family. 

The entire restaurant has great decor, atmosphere, and aesthetic. From the zen entrance way, you get a great feel for the place- stepping inside to see ceilings lined with big, beautiful umbrellas for a really unique touch. 

The food and service never disappoint! They have an extensive menu, with great Chinese dishes, sushi offerings, and even a taste of Thai! You can't go wrong- go with your gut!

Sesame Inn also offers a fully stocked bar as well as a sushi bar. It's always cool to have a drink while you are watching your sushi get prepared. 

I definitely recommend giving this place a try. Reliable staff. Delicious food. Reasonably priced. You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"Sesame inn is a Chinese restaurant with very delightful employees. I could not even knit-pick things wrong with this place. The food is always fresh and a reasonable price. Their lunch specials are very inexpensive and come with an egg roll. I get take out here at least once a week and have never had a problem. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the low reviews. I guess it depends on what you order. Ate there the other day. 4 different dishes plus soups and egg rolls. Everything was absolutely fantastic. Maybe it's because where I live there are not many options. Everybody where I live thinks Applebees is fine dining. But again my meal at sesame was top notch."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful ambiance, loved it! 

The service here is great. I've had Matt & Nokky during my visits who were both very friendly, outgoing and attentive to us during our meal.

EVERYTHING I've had here is delicious. This place is worlds above any other Asian food I've had in Pittsburgh. They have an impressive menu with the expected entrees, sushi and even a section of Thai dishes. Not a huge selection of Specialty sushi rolls, but they definitely have quality ingredients. Two of my favorite dishes were the Walnut Chicken and the Ginger Chicken.

The portions are huge, so you have a great chance of having some delicious left-overs! This is definitely my go-to spot for quality Asian food!"}
{"text":"My in laws live in Pittsburgh and come to this restaurant for dinner every Christmas Eve. They are not Chinese and enjoy American Chinese cruise. The food is mediocre and service is inconsistent. One year we waited over an hour for a table even with a reservation. I don't look forward to tomorrow's dinner, although I can put up with a subpar Chinese dinner once a year."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch special is such a good value for your money! The egg rolls are huge, hot and sour soup was so good. My only complaint is that my husband got the amazing chicken and i got general tso's. I was expecting mine to be spicy but it wasn't and both of them kind of tasted the same. Overall, so good!"}
{"text":"Every location sincerely has the BEST customer service, consistently good food and a great atmosphere. Eat here!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place in Pittsburgh.  

I typically stick with any spicy brown sauce...hunan, szechuan, kung pao...but here I branch out a little. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  

My wife measure Kung Pao Chicken relative to this place.  So far every other chinese restaurant in our area comes up as \"it's not as good as...\"  

Nice atmosphere.  Weird location."}
{"text":"You really have to be looking for this place in order to be able to find it.  It is up a hill off of McKnight Road and tucked behind/into a car dealership. 

When you enter, there is a large lobby area with Chinese decor.  The dining area itself is in two tiers.  The lower tier which includes the sushi bar and the upper tier which provides a \"view\" (I say \"view\" because you overlook a parking lot and McKnight Road).  

We went early on a Friday evening.  There were still several tables empty but the hostess took a bit of time deciding where to seat us.  I'm not sure if they take reservations but perhaps some of the tables were reserved and they just didn't mark them.

I enjoy that the menu has both sushi and chinese items.  I love sushi and was excited to order a roll as an appetizer.  I had the spicy tuna and my husband had a california roll.  Both were decent.  Not the best sushi I've ever had, but the fish seemed fresh and there was a lot of flavor.

It was tough trying to decide which entree to get since there were so many choices.  I had the Bride and Groom dish.  I enjoyed the flavor but I disliked the size and texture of the meat pieces.  They were pretty large and not that easy to cut or chew.  Not something I'd order again.

Overall a decent meal, but not a place I would go out of my way to return to."}
{"text":"I should have known better than to order Pad Thai from a chinese place. Gross gross gross. The other vegetarian options just didn't sound appetizing."}
{"text":"It's kinda typical American Chinese food with a little fusion style. The food is Ok. But their steaming dumpling (xiao long Bao) is really really good. Must try it. The dining environment is better than some other Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the lemon chicken and hot and sour soups it was great and plentiful had enough for a second dinner when I got home. The soup was amongst the best I've had. Would definitely go back. Service was excellent and v date night appropriate!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My hubby and I are regulars and iv never had anything I didn't like from there!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food here. Our favorites are General Tso chicken & shrimp with walnuts. Lomain is good too. Lemon chicken is hit or miss. 

Big tip: We always ask for white meat chicken. 

We order delivery & it works well."}
{"text":"Contrary to my checkins, I eat here all the time, mainly for lunch and sometimes dinner.  Almost always carry out (only because I live so close).  The ambiance here is a bit dated, but clean, fung shui deco'd and good for all sorts of occasions.  The take out is very good, but dining in is always better.  I'm a big shrimp fan and I love their General Tso's Shrimp, shrimp lo mein and shrimp fried rice.  They're my go-to dishes and they do them very well."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sesame Inn for years, and it is definitely my favorite place in the North Hills for Chinese, and really one of the top 5 places I've had for Chinese period.  The menu has expanded a bit over the years, now containing some sushi and Thai dishes.  Personally, I'd stick to the Chinese food.  One of my favorite dishes is the Walnut Shrimp, which also comes as a chicken option.  Candied walnuts along with battered and fried chicken or shrimp (not a health food I'm sure...) doused in a brown sweet, but a little spicy, sauce.  If you're not sure what to order or are not super adventurous, this is a great dish to start with.  I've yet to meet a person who doesn't like it.  The other entrée I order regularly is the Chicken with Garlic Sauce, which is a bit of a healthier option.  Sautéed chicken with numerous vegetables including broccoli, water chestnuts, onions, and baby corns in a garlic, somewhat spicy, sauce.  All of their entrees are HUGE, so come hungry, plan to split with someone, or leave with your lunch for the next day.  Their egg rolls are also amazing, and the duck sauce and spicy mustard they serve with them are delicious.  The spicy mustard will definitely clean out your sinuses if used in a moderate or large quantity!

The service is always friendly and helpful.  Most of their staff has been working here since I was a wee one, so they have to be doing something right!  The atmosphere is a classy Chinese restaurant with white table clothes, sometimes glowing candles or flowers, and fancy folding cloth napkins.  Not a bad place for a date or business dinner.  The only odd thing about the atmosphere, which has improved over the years, is the general location.  It shares a building with a car dealer's repair shop so from the outside it doesn't really scream fine dining, but keep on walking in and I guarantee you'll be pleasantly surprised.

My only beef with Sesame Inn is that years ago they discontinued my favorite appetizer, the Pu Pu platter.  I only put this fact in this review as a longshot attempt at getting it reinstated. 

Overall, definitely a gem in the North Hills and a place that I will be surely dining at for years to come!"}
{"text":"Bummer. Sunday afternoon. Not enough staff here. We had party of nine. Much of food was lukewarm to cold. Flavors were mediocre."}
{"text":"Definitely not a fan of this place.  The food is okay--typical \"americanized Chinese,\" like you'd get at a takeout place, but overpriced.  I went most recently on a Sunday morning for brunch with some friends, and they all ordered off the brunch menu.  I could not, because they would not make any vegetarian substitutions and the waiter made fun of me for not wanting chicken.

I had to order from the regular menu and wait through their first two courses for my food, which was just okay.  The decor is faux fancy--but there is visible water damage on the ceiling and walls, and they just don't quite pull it off.  If you live really close, I could see that you might go here for Chinese but otherwise I would skip it.  There are many better options that are more reasonably priced in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Sunday morning for a birthday brunch with 6 other members of my family.  I have eaten food from the Sesame Inn before but have never actually been to the restaurant.  We arrived at around 11:40 to find both sets of doors open and proceeded to head into the restaurant.  Once there we were greeted by the hostess who told us that the restaurant did not open until noon.  Since we were already there we decided to wait out in the lobby/sunroom type area.  It was actually quite a nice area that was decorated brightly with plants and some spacious seats.  At around 11:50 we were told that they were now ready for us and that we could sit inside.  The inside of the restaurant is just as nice as the lobby area was and had some large windows, birds of paradise flowers and some nice decorating.  The lights seemed to be embedded in what looked like large umbrellas and I thought that it gave the restaurant a nice feel.

For my entrée I decided to go with the Mongolian Chicken, extra spicy.  Since it was Sunday, there was also a brunch option on the menu which gave the option of 4 popular dishes that would also be served with soup, salad or egg roll, the entrée and a soft drink (no free refills on them if received from brunch).  Everyone else at the table ordered a brunch menu item except for me and within a short time there were all served their egg rolls and soup.  Thankfully for me, my cousin is not a big fan of soup and so I was able to get him to order hot and sour soup for me.  The soup came out hot, was very tasty and I enjoyed it.  I have to admit that I was pretty jealous of the egg rolls that everyone else got as well as they were absolutely humongous.  After everyone had finished the starters our meals came out.  They served the white rice accompaniment family style in a huge bowl.  My Mongolian Chicken came with bamboo shoots, scallion, onion and dried hot peppers all mixed together.  The chicken was moist and tasted pretty good and I was happy that they made it my dish fairly spicy like I had asked.  I ended up added a little rice to the dish and by the time I was finished eating I was completely stuffed.

The bottom line for me is that I would head to the Sesame Inn again in the future.  It costs a bit more than some of the Chinese restaurants in the area but you are paying for the quality.  This was easily seen in the size and stuffing of the egg rolls and also in the wonton soup which had a decent amount of scallions and thin strips of pork in it."}
{"text":"Very hit or miss, when food is good it's very good but when it's bad it's bad. The food is very bland at times so much do that you cannot taste a difference between two completely different dishes. The previous review was correct the service is always arrogant and downright ignorant at times especially takeout. I wish there was another decent Chinese place in the area,  if you know one please let me know. If you can find another place, trust me go there"}
{"text":"This is my Chinese Restaurant date. I love this place and have enjoyed everything I have ordered. Delicious! Definitely going back"}
{"text":"I want there for lunch on a Monday afternoon, we were seated within 5 minutes, myself my friend and my 4 month old baby. As we say down, after a few minute water's and tea were given to us but nobody greeted us or said they'd be right with us, after 25 minutes I finally asked a waiter who was serving people around us who were eating and had gotten there after us. I jus asked to put an order in to go, was told hed find someone to wait on us. He came back about 5 minutes latet apologizing while I was the only was ordering bc my friend was so pissed she said she wanted nothing. Its not like we blend in either with a fussy 4 month old we kind of can't be missed. The only positive thing was the manager brought my food and said it was in the house and they're sorry but they are busy. Being I'm a server myself, I totally understand a little wait but to be totally ignored and not even greeted? Awful service. I used to order take out all the time from there and will never again."}
{"text":"Great service. Food quality will disappoint if you know Chinese.
I think they try to make up for quality with quantity."}
{"text":"Another \"Go-To\" place for our family.  We get take out at least twice a month.  \"15 minutes!\"

We sometimes even find the time to eat in and I have visited the Sushi Bar on occasion.

Recommend the Amazing Chicken (General Tao's with white meat) and a Zombie.  They will only serve you two though.  Drink them and you will know why!
The duck is excellent and their scallop dishes are outstanding!

I love the location, service and atmosphere and of course the food.."}
{"text":"I'd rank this lower, if able. I picked up an order to go and the General Tsao's sauce (which was asked to be packaged separately) was broken open. The entire bag was filled with the sauce. For one, it ruined the meal and two it leaked through the paper bag and through a slit in the plastic bag. The sauce was all over the front seat of my brand new Jeep. I called and asked for the manager and explained someone must have packed it incorrectly, because the sauce was on the bottom and the food on top of it (not smartly packed). He called me a liar and said there's no way it happened, but I pictures to prove it and he hung up on me. NEVER, EVER GO TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT. The smart@ss manager needs to be fired, but I've found it, it's the owner's son, so he must think he has the freedom to tell customers what he likes. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Chinese places I've found in Pittsburgh. Most Chinese places are all the same and it all tastes average. Sesame Inn is a lot nicer than your typical neighborhood Chinese restaurant. 

I started with a bowl of hot and sour soup which was very good. Some places make theirs too sweet and others make it too hot. This was the perfect balance of both. As my entree I got the sesame chicken which I wasn't all that impressed with but that is only because I'm not a huge fan of dark meat. I did however try my friends amazing chicken and the name is very fitting. The amazing chicken had just the right amount of breaking. It was not loaded with fried breaking like a lot of other Chinese places. It was also made with white meat which I like a lot better. The only complaint I would have is the price. It is about double the price of your local Chinese restaurant so be prepared to spend $15-20 on a entree.

{"text":"My favorite Orange Beef!! Crunchy, the spicy Orange sauce, just delicious!!! The appetizer of boneless spare ribs and wonton soup makes for a perfect meal!!!! A close second is their General TSO's chicken, always crunchy and delicious!! Don't forget to ask for the Chili Oil!!"}
{"text":"Normally I never choose a Chinese restaurant to eat at because I just don't enjoy the food. I gave it a shot and I'm actually really happy I did. We ordered the general tso's tofu and omg - so good. Crispy and light with fresh rice and sauce on the side. I was so unimpressed with the soup we ordered that I don't even remember the name. The sushi on the other hand was sizable and hit the spot. We ordered an avocado/cream cheese roll which we haven't had in years as well as a sweet potato tempura roll. The spicy mayo is spicy but not overwhelming and our waitress was very nice. The decor is somewhat outdated but that's okay."}
{"text":"Me and wifey ate here tonight. She had the Maki Platter which came with 3 different types of Sushi. I had the super BOMB! General Tso's Chicken with fried rice. This General Tso's is that of which all other are judged by. I don't remember our servers name but she was very attentive and also very pleasant. This restaurant is a top of the list stop for the whole family when in Pittsburgh. (Go Steelers, Pens and Pirates!!) They have two locations, one is in North Hills and one at Station Square."}
{"text":"Sesame Inn has truly been my guilty pleasure after my workouts at Club Julian. We all need a treat some time. Anyways, the decor is beautiful, in my humble opinion. There is a sushi bar area and regular seating. I love good service, and I feel they were very kind and cool; the atmosphere is calm and inviting. 
Ok, so I have actually been there on several different occasions, to dine in and for take out. The Amazing Chicken is good. Fresh white meat chicken, cooked to perfection...not too dry. But my addiction is the chicken lo mein and chicken egg roll. It is so delicious. I have a hard time eating other restaurants lo mein now after this. So, it is a must try!!!!
 And again, I love the chicken eggrolls. The shrimp eggrolls are good as well but it is a spring roll with a lighter crust. But still tasty!
This is a good date night place, girls night out, or in my case...cheat night after the gym."}
{"text":"This chain of restaurants has three locations in the Burgh. I had never been to this location so I jumped at the chance to go with friends. I had never been on a Sunday and I didn't know they had brunch. The brunch menu had a lot of options. You could pick one of the entrees and two from the \"sides\" type menu. The sides menu included salad, egg roll, soup, crab Rangoon, a mimosa, and a few other things. I ordered the Double Delight-Chicken and shrimp with veggies in a brown sauce. You could get fried, steamed, or brown rice along with your dish. For my sides I prefer an egg roll and Carb Rangoon. The egg roll came out on a small plate along with 2 Crab Rangoon. They also brought out a small dish of hot mustard and a small bowl of duck sauce. The egg roll was room temperature. I would have preferred it to be a little warmer. There was crunch on the outside and the inside was flavorful. The Crab Rangoon was also room temperature and the filling was starting to congeal. Not a good thing. My Double Delight was a nice portion size. It had a lot of chicken, shrimp, and veggies. It was cooked perfectly. The sauce was a nice consistency and had a nice flavor. A nice surprise was that you could get a free California sushi roll with your meal. I missed the sign about it so I missed out. The food I had already was more than enough. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've yet to find a Chinese restaurant that I like more than Sesame Inn. As others have said, the location is sort of weird (attached to a car dealership). But hey -- Adds to the character of the place. The interior is very nice and the staff is friendly.

I almost always order the Amazing Chicken because... wait for it... it's AMAZING. It's all lean white meat chicken, breaded and magicked by some sorcerer. Then it's doused with a sweet sauce for extra amazingness. There is definitely more than enough for lunch the next day. The serving sizes are jumbo.

The sushi and maki rolls are really great too. The last time I ate here I ordered the sweet potato maki roll, which is a vegetarian roll made with fried sweet potato, avocado, and cream cheese. AND IT WAS SO GOOD. So so so so good. So. Good. 

They also offer some Thai dishes. I've tried a couple and they are ok if you're in the mood for Thai, but I always go back to that Amazing Chicken. Yum!"}
{"text":"Really really is all I have to say. Asked for delivery within 3.1 miles of their radius. But they only delivery within  3 miles. Really you can't go the extra .1 miles for a $70 order. REALLY.   Wow what a way to run a business. Keep your overpriced non deliverable food ."}
{"text":"Chic and serene interior decor make for a tasteful dining experience (without the hefty price tag) featuring American-ized Chinese and Japanese cuisine.   Case in point: You have to request chopsticks - forks, knives, spoons, salt&pepper (and did I see ketchup?) are set on the white tablecloth in anticipation of your carnivorous needs. 

I recommend the lighter fare options (reportedly less sodium, no MSG, and sauce on the side).  Most of the dishes are mild - request extra spice if you like it hot. The meats are of typical Chinese restaurant quality (i.e. questionable).  The staff is on point.  

Overall an elegant dining experience to contrast the North Hills' suburban sprawl."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for many years (since the closing of the grocery store there) and have always considered it my go to American Chinese restaurant in the North Hills..my last couple of visits the food has been subpar. I'm not sure if something has changed with the ownership, the chef, food supplier etc but it hasn't been good. I had General Tso chicken for lunch with brown rice ..the sauce was bland and had a weird flavor I couldn't pinpoint..almost a fishy flavor..the other dish was chicken with broccoli in own sauce with brown rice...same thing an odd flavor almost sour. Very different from what we have experienced in the past..we mentioned this to our server, and he indicated he had heard similar feedback from other diners today and that he would tell the chef. We ate a third of our plates and asked for the check. Don't think we are going back here again."}
{"text":"Came for an early Sat. lunch (11:45) - it was fairly empty when we arrived but filled up quickly while we ate. Ordered the \"Tangy Spicy Scallops and Shrimp\" and the \"Triple Delight.\" Both had bountiful portions, were fresh and well made. To nitpick the food tends toward bland - the Tangy Spicy was really only tangy - so I will request more spice next time. And the side egg roll is highly overpriced at $3. But the soups and hot tea are excellent and the waiter was courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"It had been years since I had visited this attractive, comfortable restaurant.  My fiancée picked up an order that we consumed at home on 17 October 2017: what a disappointment for $36.14.  The $3 egg rolls were modest size, dry, and ordinary.  My $12 tofu with mixed vegetables was ordered mild, which apparently means bland to Sesame Inn. The sauce was watery.  My fiancée's $13 chicken with mixed vegetables should have been served in a rich, brown sauce, but was essentially steamed, not tasty.  The egg drop soup was satisfactory.  This restaurant can charge lofty prices and succeed because there is not much competition in the area.  I have a new appreciation for the lower-priced and better Red Tea House in Mount Lebanon, my favorite."}
{"text":"Best American Chinese food you're gonna eat. Ever. Have been coming here since I was a kid and always have a wonderful time. They also have sushi and other Japanese options. I frequently get their Thai dishes as well and they are equally as delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious, and well established restaurant in the North Hills. This is one of our go-to asian restaurants in the area. We have been lifelong fans of the Amazing Chicken. The chicken is all white meat and perfectly fried, and tastes something between Gen Tso's and Sesame Chicken. While the white rice is extremely bland and uninteresting, the rest of the food sort of makes up for it. Great for lunch, dinner, or to go."}
{"text":"I've been to the Sesame Inn a handful of times and have tried a variety of dishes.  I don't always go with my \"stand bys\" as I like to try new foods so I've not always liked what I've had there, but in general, it's a pretty solid place.  A few years ago, I held a wedding shower in their banquet room and they didn't disappoint!  As with every experience I had there, the portions were large and the service was excellent.

I haven't tried enough of a variety of their sushi, but the rolls I did try there were fresh and well-prepared.  

My one caveat is this: If you're looking to go and have a few alcoholic beverages, bring your gold card because their libations can get pricey in comparison to the other restaurants in the North Hills."}
{"text":"I give them 4 stars for service and cleanliness.  This is one of the best Chinese cuisine places in Pittsburgh.  Something is missing from the menu.  While the dinner plates are huge, it would be nice to see smaller portions at smaller prices.  When you eat chinese, one of my favorite things to do in China is get 10 little plates.  You can't do that at Sesame because it would be too expensive.  

Solution:  Buffet ... probably not.
Solution:  A Tasters menu, with sushi on it."}
{"text":"I give it four stars because the taste is not always consistent. I visited a few times, when the food is good it's absolutely delicious. Sometimes it just doesn't match up. But I have had mostly positive experiences."}
{"text":"Our go to place for some Chinese food delivery!  Their shrimp egg rolls are the best in Pittsburgh. There is lots of shrimp and the wrapping is perfectly crispy and not too thick. The chicken lettuce wraps are pretty good too and serve a lot of people. The coconut shrimp are also super tasty and coated in shredded coconut. The crab rangoons are standard nothing special. Their chicken corn chowder soup which is no longer on the menu is also a must. It is the perfect soup that is simple but tasty with corn, chicken, and egg. 

We also usually get their shrimp fried rice. It is loaded with huge shrimp! Their lo mein also really hits the spot. Full of flavor and vegetables and not too oily. The general tsos chicken is also always good but a bit on the heavier side with the thick breading and sweet sauce. The shrimp with garlic sauce is also a favorite with broccoli, water chestnuts, and a tasty sauce. The Kung pao chicken has a nice crunch with lots of peanuts, and celery. 

Overall, a great to place to get some take out. The dinner portions are huge and great to share with."}
{"text":"We tried Sesame Inn on a recent Sunday afternoon.  The location is just plain weird.  Off Route 19, we drove thru a car dealership to get here.  We certainly must have missed a turn.

The interior is a bit dated and could use a bit of a refresh.  Also, the entrance is a great place for kids to pick up rocks and pound them while parents watch.

We were greeted and seated right away.  White table clothes are a nice touch.  Our server was great.  BJ ordered off the Sunday Brunch menu which is really a great deal.  All of the options are between 11 and 13 bucks and include appetizer, soup and beverage.  Of course, he was getting beer, not included, so I got his drink.  He got Triple Delight with beef, chicken and shrimp with vegetables in brown sauce.  So good!  I got my usual General Tso Shrimp, it was very good.  All in all, a great experience.  It's a place we will visit again and again."}
{"text":"I moved to Pittsburgh from Seattle, where there was plenty of delicious and authentic Chinese food to be found.  I was quite skeptical of Sesame Inn when I first heard about it (oily, MSG-laden sweet and sour chicken? no thanks!), but I was willing to give it a shot.  The restaurant had plenty of parking in their private lot, so I didn't have trouble there.  The restaurant itself is quite aesthetically pleasing with clean floors and tables and an amazingly large umbrella hanging from the ceiling (it's prettier than how I'm describing it).  The service was fast and friendly.  The menu is quite extensive and can be a bit mind-boggling at first.  I went with my sister and she ordered a shrimp and scallop dish while I went for the garlic basil eggplant.  When our plates came, the food was hot and the portions were huge.  For both dishes the sauces were amazing and the food wasn't too greasy or salty.  Although the flavors weren't 100% authentic Chinese, this was definitely a step up from your average take-out/American Chinese place.  If you really want authentic dishes, maybe stop by Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill, but Sesame Inn by itself is not only a delicious choice but you'll enjoy dining here too.  I will continue to dine here often!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars for me and my hubby. Service was very slow. That is a definite factor in a 2.5 stars rating. I feel like the food was average. I loved my crab Rangoons. Yummy! But I feel like the sesame chicken my hubby got and my sweet and sour chicken were a bit oversauced. And the sweet potato roll was sweet potato fries wrapped up like sushi, eh. The hubby did like the wonton soup. The fried rice was good.  Overall, average. I would come back for the Rangoons. But we are not in a hurry to come back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best Chinese ever! The amazing chicken duo. You won't regret going here."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Pittsburgh . Try the chicken and eggplant for lunch. My wife and I - our death row meal !"}
{"text":"Always come here for Chinese food in Pittsburgh. This place is so good! The food is always tasty and fresh. I love the chicken egg rolls, they're a must have! 

The general tso chicken and the chicken and broccoli are some of my fave dishes. The zombie cocktail is also very good. Will continue to come back as long as the food stays great!"}
{"text":"Okay, I have now been to 3 of the Pittsburgh Sesame Inn's eating my favorite dish, salt and pepper shrimp. This location was odd, sautéed onions and mushrooms covered the  shrimp making them soggy! Extra pepper to them meant course black ground rather then the White pepper the dish calls for, major mistake! I will not come back here, south  hills location does it well."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but it was pricey and the food didn't live up to the hype. It was ok but not worth the money. I had takeout so I can't comment on the restaurant itself or the service. My husband felt the same way about his meal - mediocre."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pad Thai because I had ordered it before at their mt. Lebanon location and it was delicious! Not the case here. It was so bland that it tasted like buttered noodles with chicken. Waited forever for the waiter to come back to the table so that I could ask him about it. He was clueless. When I asked him for some of the spicy sauce that comes on the dish normally, he returned with siracha. Yes. That will give the heat that I was craving but not what I asked for. Took us getting the attention of the hostess? Manager? Not sure what her job was? To rectify the situation. To her credit. She did come back to the table with what better filled the basic requirements for pad thai but I don't think I will ever be back to give them a third try."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the quality of Sesame Inn! I was not expecting much because, realistically, how many great Chinese restaurants are attached to a Toyota dealership? 

Walking in, I found that the restaurant itself is very clean and presentable - first hurdle cleared! I was very impressed with the variety of vegetarian options they offered on the menu as well. We came in right in time for their lunch specials, so I ordered the lunch sushi option where you choose 2 rolls and a soup. I went with the garden roll and the tamago roll - both were great! Standard sushi quality, but with the low price, it was a fantastic deal. My boyfriend ordered the General Tso's Chicken which was very crispy and the sauce was flavorful without being too sweet or sour. The food earns our seal of approval! 

If I needed a reason to love this place even more, the waiter provided the best customer service. He was very friendly, attentive, and delivered our food and drinks very quickly. I couldn't have asked for better service.  I will definitely be back! Sesame Inn, I will see you at my next oil change!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, usually when I'm headed to the mall or to Gabes. 

The lunch menu is reasonably priced and the portions are very generous! Some of the things that we have sampled include the egg rolls, coconut shrimp, pork dumplings, amazing chicken, and Singapore noodles. 

Everything is well made and comes out of the kitchen quickly. Service is always great and the tea is also delicious! 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so greedy. Even when a mistake is made by them, like forgetting the egg roll on a delivery order, they refuse to take care of it claiming they delivered the egg roll and you're lying about it. After years of not patronizing them because of that, I started ordering from them again. Once a week in fact. I forgot an entree when I made my initial order and didn't realize until my food was delivered. They wouldn't allow me to order it for delivery unless I ordered something else to get it over $20. Forget the almost $50 order I just got. Now I'm done. They're food isn't even that good, but they were better than the only other Chinese restaurant that would deliver. I won't give anymore of my hard earned money to these jerks."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, excellent service.  I'm very picky about my sushi from how tight its wrapped to the freshness.  I must say I was impressed.  The menu has a lot to offer as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place.  My son recommended it last time we visited.  I didn't expect much, but everything was fantastic from the drinks to the Chinese to the sushi.  When we headed to Pittsburgh again last weekend I had to get back there even though I was beyond exhausted from the 11 hour drive.  There was a 30 min wait, which we weren't in the mood for, so we sat at the bar.  The bartender was super friendly and our food was out in a flash.  Best part - it was just as great as the last time we had it.

Even though we love the usual suspects when visiting Pitt - this is my #1 must go to.

Note:  the two times we went were at two different locations.  The one at the mall was situated really weird.  You feel like you're driving into a car dealer.  I prefer the atmosphere of the one near GreenTree - sorry, I can't remember the name of the town - but they're both great."}
{"text":"This restaurant is spoke of often in our local community, and we've done both sit-down and take-out on several occasions without any major likes or dislikes either way.  The wait staff at the tables have always friendly, but on one previous visit, my wife and I once noted how a female \"manager\" was uncomfortably derogatory towards one of her counter staff.  Maybe she was an owner, who knows...but we could clearly tell she wasn't pleased with the girl for something she did. We joked about it later between ourselves, saying we probably wouldn't let our children apply there when they hit high school!

Well, on our visit tonight, a man in a shirt and tie taking payments was very arrogant when I asked if there was duck sauce in our take-out bag!  His response was flat-out ignorant and condescending, as if I should have known what they packed in the bag.  Hey, if you can't be at least somewhat thankful that we chose to spend our $50 in your establishment, then perhaps we'll not bother calling again.

I'd like to think that we caught these folks on a few \"bad days\", but nonetheless, we're not comfortable with this pattern.  And so I felt compelled to \"tell it like it is\" for others to make their own judgements.

In all fairness, the Sesame Inn (Peters) has good food, but it's always seemed a bit over-priced for what you get.  It's good, but not THAT good.  The food and friendly staff would get a 4, but factor in a solid 2 for the overbearing bullies in charge.

Since a customer's overall experience includes feeling welcome...the Sesame Inn (Peters) gets a 3 from me."}
{"text":"Terrible service, our waitress was so rude and mean I would never come back to this place it's a shame cuz I love the food but I feel so disappointed that they don't have good service booooooo"}
{"text":"Pangeng chicken and  the volcano chicken were both good. We had over 10 people visited their once, all of us wer happy about our dinner. 
Our waiter was friendly as always."}
{"text":"I love their American Chinese food. It is fantastic and not real Chinese food. It is like the chicken tenders of Asian cuisine. However, recently I was there with a beautiful lady and did not want to embarrass myself by ordering something like General Tso's chicken, so I went out on a shaky limb and ordered the Pad Thai. Yes, I understand Pad Thai is like the Beatles of Thai food. However, I thought that played right into the Sesame Inn's hand. How do you mess up Pad Thai? Well, I can answer my own question. Firstly, they never asked for a spice level. That was because there were no spices whatsoever. The pile of noodles and thin strips of chicken were an insult to chickens and Thai people in general. Don't get me wrong,  I still love their American Chinese. It is like going to a fancy McDonald's and I love McDonald's. But in all honesty, what a way to waste 12 bucks. Or maybe it was 14. God, I hope it wasn't 14."}
{"text":"Love this place. Get the amazing chicken at least once every week-2weeks. I always order for takeout  so I can split the large portion with someone else. Portions from this place are huge and it's the most crispy chinese i've had. Sauce is amazing on the amazing chicken. Overall I would recommend getting their takeout over sitting down. But the food will be at its prime if you sit down. Faster wait time if you order takeout."}
