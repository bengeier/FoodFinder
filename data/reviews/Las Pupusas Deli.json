{"text":"Great food and service. Pupusas were great and so was the chicken quesadilla. Will deft be back again and refer."}
{"text":"Delicious and hot pupusas. Had the cheese and pork filled. Pork filled was a bit light but still good, the cheese filled smelled and tasted amazing. They also had a bean or cheese and vegetable option. Came with two sauces, the red was very good. Pickled coleslaw was a great compliment. Cashier was very friendly and helped point me what to order. Can't beat it for $2 each."}
{"text":"This little El Salvadoran deli caught my eye on the way the pick up a friend at the airport. Super simple, plain, and clean- leave your judgement at the door! The menu is limited to some very basic choices but the food is absolutely delicious. The bean and cheese pupusa was my fave! Next time I want to try the Queso Centro Americano"}
{"text":"Driving by there's nothing that would entice you to stop at thus restaurant and after eating there today I understand why. It's a very basic restaurant with no decor at all. You place your order at the cashier and they bring your food out. We ordered a couple of Pork Pupusas and we were not impressed at all! Very stingy with the pork, barely noticeable that we were eating any meat at all. The horchata was HORRIBLE! The prices are affordable but I would expect it to be considering how bad the food is."}
{"text":"Great handmade pupusas in a little place with no frills. Just handmade pupusas like you'd find in El Salvador.  Bien hechas.!"}
