{"text":"My wife and I made the short trip to Cave Creek yesterday. I had read the reviews of the Hot Dog Guy, so we decided to give him a try. The reviews are spot on. The dogs are great. When I visit Chicago, I go to Portillo's, and these dogs are a bit better. Probably the fresh buns and the fresher southwest produce. Also, he is a really friendly personable guy. If I get back to Cave Creek, you can bet I'll eat here again!"}
{"text":"I visit Jerry often and believe he serves up one of the best hot dogs around. I'm especially partial to his coney dog with cheese. Along with quality Vienna beef, he applies just the right amount of steam to soften it up.  Along with great dogs, Jerry is always upbeat and will put a smile on y"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. The Chicago Dogs are delicious. Haven't found anything there I don't love. Give it a try. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great place for a dog!  We live in Indiana and go see him when we are in Scottsdale.  Nice to keep locals in business!"}
{"text":"I was up north in the Cave Creek area on business yesterday and stopped by this Hot Dog stand.  What a wonderful surprise!   The Hot Dog Guy, Jerry Vicena is indeed from Chicagoland and has a good understanding on how to make and serve a tasty dog.  But, he's not just a one trick pony with his Chicago Red Hots.  He also serves a Coney Island dog, a Polish, a East Coaster, etc.  All were very good from what the folks around me said, as we sat and ate while enjoying the cool sunny day up north.   I would definitely, definitely come back or make a special trip to this Hot Dog Guy!  Nice job, Jerry!  You do Chi-caw-go proud!"}
{"text":"Shawn is the new Hot dog Guy now.  Actually he's the Hot Dog Daddy.  Doing my route today and had a hunkering for a Chicago Dog.  Stopped by Shawn's stand and had an awesome dog. If you find yourself in Cave Creek give it a try.  For all you hot dog lovers, definitely the real McCoy.  Update 12/6/17 Sadly he is no longer.  Mikes Chicago Dog up the street in front of the American Legion."}
{"text":"Hey - All the local construction guys eat here - so you he has good quality stuff at low prices. Nice assortment of different Hot dogs."}
{"text":"Stopped by Hot Dog Guy after a hike today. He was located on Cave Creek Road in front of El Encanto's market. I had a Chicago Dog and hubby had a Wild West Wiener. The bill was less than $10 and the dogs were tasty. He uses Vienna Beef dogs and nice, fluffy poppy seed buns from Basha's. The Chicago Dog had lots of tomatoes, a pickle spear and some good sport peppers. The Wild West Wiener had BBQ sauce, bacon, and Frito's corn chips.  I will definitely stop by again for fast, cheap, good food!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I know a good hot dog.  When a friend from New York who lived in Cave Creek told us about the \"Hot Dog Guy\" and that he serves top-notch NY- and Chicago-style dogs, we knew we had to go.  Finding out that Jerry is a fellow Chicagoan and knows how a dog should taste was quite a happy feeling.  The Coney was phenomenal.  At the risk of sounding blasphemous--the Polish was better than Portillos'.  No fooling.  AND the best part is--you get $1 off your 2nd dog!  So, of course, we got another Polish.  Very pleasant ambiance and quick service--closed my eyes and felt like I was \"home\" again.  Chicagoans or New Yorkers--please stop by and give him your business.  And anybody else who appreciates a great hot dog--for that matter!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I have missed Chicago Dogs since moving here.  They were good, although one of my buns had a hard bottom.  He claims he bakes them fresh everyday.  The celery salt really made the dog and most of my buns were moist.  I did miss having fresh cut fries...not quite Gene and Judes...but close."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs, great service, and he even takes debit if you're out of cash!"}
{"text":"I was really craving a Chicago dog knew just the place to go have never been disappointed had 2 of them"}
