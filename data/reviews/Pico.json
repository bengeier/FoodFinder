{"text":"I was out for brunch with a group of 8 and we were looking for an alternative because our original choice had an hour wait.  Pico popped up on yelp and it was a great find.  With such a large group, close to the noon hour, I called to see if there was any space.  The host was pleasant and had a table ready for us by the time we walked over (not even 5 minutes).

Love the atmosphere of the restaurant, simple and casual cafe style. Menu options were many, from granola & yogurt to poached eggs to crepes to french toast.   The prices were comparable to many of the breakfast-chain-restaurants. I chose to get the traditional breakfast - with 2 eggs, roasted potatoes, spring mix salad and peameal bacon; $8.  

Great place, definitely worth going back to try more!"}
{"text":"Gang of five went there for Sunday Bruch for the first time and were impressed. Nice selection of reasonably sized dishes. Draft beer and Bloody Mary made with horseradish. Friendly staff and the Chef dropped by to ensure everything was okay. No reservations so groups of four or more should try to get there a little earlier or later than the normal rush hour to avoid a wait. Will definitely be back again for Brunch and also to try the place for Dinner. Location - King St. E @ Sherbourne."}
{"text":"Pico is a new restaurant spot on King Street East that replaced Toba.  
I was at Pico this past weekend for brunch and was pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere is European caf√©-charming, with its high ceilings, mouldings on the wall, art, and open kitchen.  Lighting was a bit dim for brunch but I guess that could work in your favour.   Service was fast and cheerful. 

As far as the food goes, the eggs were fluffy, the salad not too drenched in dressing, the toast abnormally thick- my fellow brunch goer and myself were debating what type of bread the \"brown bread\" was, and the hash browns, smashed potato.   The menu covers the brunch basics, French toast, eggs, yogurt/granola etc... and Pico also has a good selection of alcoholic/non alcoholic brunch complements. 

The only disappointing thing about Pico was their scones.  For $5 you get one hard, dry, scone (it says scones (plural)) on the menu) which comes with homemade preserves and what tasted like whipped cream.   For a restaurant that promotes the fact that the baked goods are fresh/made in house, a hard, dry scone is not cool.  Nor is it cool to charge $5 for one scone when it says scones, plural, on the menu!

Minus the scones, I would go back for brunch and give it another go."}

Went by 243 King St E today (Aug 31, 2010) and Pico is now \"Bistro 243\", new owners, new bistro menu.
