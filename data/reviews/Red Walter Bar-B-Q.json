{"text":"OMG!! This restaurant is ran exceptionally well. It is under new management. So the environment has a comforting feel more so welcoming and CLEAN! My family and I wanted to taste a few food items so we ordered fish, wings , cheeseburger and polish sausage. Everything was cooked to perfection. Overall great service. However the wait is still Long due to the high volume of customers so I suggest you call in and order if you're in a rush or if you don't want to wait. Everything else is on point"}
{"text":"Last Friday I called in my order so I didn't have to wait so long, always follow your first mind! Something told me to go somewhere else! me being lazy, went there because it's close to home, 25 min later after putting in my order I went to pick it up, as I was standing in line I noticed something running down the pole by the deep fryer, it was the biggest rat that I've ever seen!!! I screamed and ran out of there as fast as I could.... They don't ever have to worry about me again! And it came out in front of everyone! I'm still shook up! Smh"}
{"text":"All I can say is never again! I spent $8.50 on the most nastiest perch dinner.  The fish was non existent and on some white bread.  Cold,  stale disgusting fries. Never again!"}
