{"text":"Stopped in to try the pizza twist and I wasn't disappointed.  I bought the cheese filled version and they were yummy.  My only complaint is I wish the twist were more consistent with cheese and tomato sauce, not every twist was the same.  The service was excellent and accommodating meaning they only had 5 cheese twist when I asked for 6 so they charged me for 4...very sweet!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. Latif is a pizza genius. I've tried all the pies, meatlovers is the favorite. Classic is also good not as heavy. I like it well done thin crust to try making it lighter. They never skimp on toppings and everything is fresh. I always enjoy here more then pizza pizza."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza and the ingredients are very good.  I typically get the party pizza and the kids love it. Great local pizza and the prices are very comparable to any nationwide chain. Very friendly owners."}
{"text":"Wow! Probably the best pizza I have had in a while, lately I have been let down but I must say I am really really happy I found this place. The pizza twirls are to die for and the new skull pizza twirls are next level amazing. I think delivery is available but we went inside to eat and it is cute."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza excellent wings excellent service could not have asked for a better meal for our family great prices very good experience"}
{"text":"Quaint little pizza place located in the same plaza as a Portugese chicken place I have been to before.  I ordered wings, pizza twists and wedges.  Everything was made fresh while i waited.  The pizza twists were delicious and the tomato sauce used was perfectly balanced, not too tart or sweet.  Wings were plump and flavorful.  Service was courteous prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"Ordered Four Brothers Large Pizza and was extremely disappointed.  Was looking forward to it since reading the 4 star review.  

I ordered a pizza well done and thin crust.  It was neither.  Pizza was soft and felt undercooked.  

The protein smoothie that was ordered was nothing to rave about either.  

If they offered a redo I wouldn't be giving them as bad as a review.  When I called the worker stated that you have to say \"extra crispy\" for it to be well done.  

Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good value to be had here. We ordered delivery at 11:00 on Saturday night. Our food came in under 35 minutes and everything was hot and tasted fresh. For the price, the panzerottis were big, and I liked the way they were cooked. The only thing I would change would be to put less sauce inside them so they wouldn't be so hard to cut and the cheese wouldn't mix with the sauce so much. Would definitely order again as a change up to our regular place, and maybe try some other menu items."}
{"text":"We were early for the drive in around the corner do we wamted pizza n found rhis place..Prices are great ..service amazing friendly.
Ordered two calzones, only 5bucks each. Also a small order of potatoe wedges only 3$ for a huge portion enough for 3."}
{"text":"Just okay. My husband and I wanted something quick and easy for dinner, and are new to the area, so we have no idea what's any good. Definitely not NY style, and I wasn't a huge fan of the taste overall. My husband liked his a bit more, but still couldn't say he thought it was good.

Might give them another shot in a pinch, but won't go out of my way to order from them again."}
