{"text":"A true gem in Scottsdale and I probably shouldn't be yelping because I want to keep them a hidden secret. 

My friend and I went there for dinner, twice, in a 7 day period, so that says a lot.

As self proclaimed sushi aficionados, we went for the dinner, and stayed off the $5 HH menu to really get a sense of their handling of the fish.

What we ordered:
- negi hama roll (chunky)
- uni nigiri
- spicy scollops nigiri
- okonomi chirashi 

The fish is fresh and you can tell by the cut and taste.
The presentation is serene and traditional with attention to detail.
They've non of that Scottsdale trendiness or the culinary \"fusion\" invasion.
The portion is generous and you'll going home satisfied and happy.

The service is good (Ken and his family are super nice and attentive, our cup of tea is never empty). The location is convenient and centralized.

In the sea of trendy sushi restaurants where the California roll, the deep fried stuff drenched in mayo aioli or sake bombs dominate the scene, Sushi Sen is a place for reliable, traditional Japanese food."}
{"text":"Very good quality sushi here. Besides having Japanese chefs and servers, you know that you have found an authentic top notch sushi bar when half of the patrons are Japanese as well!"}
{"text":"Just tried this for the first time, a few months after it opened in summer 2017. An unpretentious family-run Japanese restaurant with cheerful and capable service, a friendly atmosphere, and great food. Worth finding at the back of an almost-deserted retail complex on Scottsdale Road and Indian Bend. We had a bento box and a pick-your-own-ingredients chirashi bowl, both very good (especially the sashimi components). The menu is extensive, though, including plenty of dishes for newcomers to Japanese food who aren't ready for raw fish. In terms of quality and atmosphere, on par with Hiro's on 90th & Via Linda - so nice to have TWO go-to Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Omg.. what a gem! Legit japanese restaurant! Agedashi tofu and sushi boat were amazing."}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times in the past month. Authentic ramen- tried the miso and shoyu. Also tried: tempura and soba noodles, agedashi tofu, chicken curry, tempura shrimp and crab roll. They were all very good! I tried the yakisoba and the chicken karaage. They were pretty bland. I would not order those again. But the ramen and the chicken curry are my favorites.  Best to make a reservation as they can get busy."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time and found a really pleasant restaurant with good service and great food. The prices were also very reasonable for such good quality. We'll be back many times with out of town guests when they want top notch sushi."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. All they care is turnover instead of customer service, do not come here"}
{"text":"Had another excellent meal at Sushi Sen! The fish is so fresh and served with fantastic attention to detail. Took over as my favorite Scottsdale sushi restaurant, for the food, hands down!"}
{"text":"Sunday , lunch...good crowd but Service was terrible!!!! You need to ask for service several times before you get to order & for water! I wondered if the rest of my order was coming?  I had to ask my other dish to-go.   We shared water after asking for 2 glasses.   We waited long  for the check after we kept asking 4 diff servers.  They said machine issues...really, can't  they add ?  Food was just ok so we won't return:("}
{"text":"We LOVE Sushi Sen! My husband and I frequent Sushi Sen about twice a month, though lately it's been more often - twice last week! The service is always prompt and friendly, the prices are reasonable (especially for Scottsdale), and their menu is quite extensive. We love that Sushi Sen not only offers delicious, fresh sushi, but also many traditional Japanese dishes that are, lets face it, hard to find in the beautiful state of Arizona. 

Happy Hour sushi is hard to beat (tuna tataki roll... mmm), but our other favorites include hamachi kama (the largest portion my Bay Area-residing MIL said she's ever had), spicy miso ramen, takoyaki, chirashi, and my personal extra-favorite, assorted Japanese pickles. 

For me, there's no better ending to a long workday than meeting the hubs to share a cold Asahi and some of our favorite Japanese dishes. Thank you, Sushi Sen, for providing an affordable Japanese dining experience, time and time again!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi around, and I've found it again! Sushi Sen is the reincarnation of Sushi Ken from Ahwatukee (which was sold to new owners) and I'm so glad that I found out where they went. Service seems to have improved pretty drastically from the old store, and the sushi comes out in quick fashion. The real deal is in their $5 rolls as they have a ton of good quality fish like yellowtail and tuna stacked on top. The happy hour menu (Monday through Saturday, 4:30pm-6:00pm) has a couple additional $5 rolls that are equally as good value. The fish, as mentioned before, has a good bite to it and feels fresh - they don't overpower it with sriracha and allow the fresh taste of the fish to come through rather than other flavorings. The restaurant space is a bit small and cramped though, so not great for large groups and might get a bit hectic during peak hours."}
{"text":"New go-to sushi joint - always order off the special board, never a disappointment!  Ramen is also awesome - lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I'm so glad the sushi ken owners opened up this restaurant. Phoenix can't afford to lose good Japanese food! I definitely like the new decor. It's located in an upscale shopping area and you're greeted by a beautiful outdoor entryway. We thought perhaps the prices would be raised, but it's still the same, affordable prices. You are given a huge menu; here's what our go-to items are: Ginger tofu (or agedashi tofu), korroke (or crab cream croquette), zaru soba, sushi (hamachi, albacore, spicy scallop, saba, inari), the white tuna tataki roll, and the chunky spicy tuna roll. Of course a Sapporo beer and sake as well. And yes, this is all in one sitting. I know...we eat like there's no tomorrow. There are other menu items that are exciting like the tsukemen, all the -don's, and the intense chirashi bowls. I definitely want to try the okonomi chirashi where you get to select 5 different items. As the weather cools I'll be trying the nabeyaki udon to warm my soul. There are still so many other menu items that I want to come back and try! Side note, my heart was also won over by the fact that they were playing the Ghibli soundtrack for my first visit. I'll be a frequent customer for sure. To sushi sen, \"Ganbatte ne!\""}
{"text":"Fresh Tuna & Halibut. Staff is very attentive and courteous. We had a sashimi plate & Spicy All Star. Both delicious. We highly recommend"}
{"text":"I'm giving this five stars because the food was really great! The service was very good too. It was very slow and they probably came to our table about 20 times getting water, Coke and even saw when my husband was blowing his nose in his napkin and they brought him more without us even asking. Sometimes when it's slow in a restaurant the service gets worse. Not so here. There were 3 or 4 tables & the staff was on it!! Plus with the happy hour prices you cannot beat it! Will be back. The only bad thing to report is a very strong odor that hits you at the door. Smells like algae. It's quite offputting but I got over it for their cheap yummy sushi and great service."}
{"text":"We did a staycation nearby at the Scott and took the complimentary ride to any place within a three mile radius. We were greeted immediately and told the specials, so glad they had a few rolls at $5 each that should normally be much more because as soon as one of our on special Seafood Baked California roll came out we were both exceptionally pleased. The service was the fantastic the fish was amazing! They nailed the Philly roll, we also had a pork noodle soup that was so incredibly tasty. We will be back!! Mmmmm just the reminder of the taste from that roll and soup, makes me hungry!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I just made a reservation, hung up, and saw a missed call from the restaurant. I called back and I was informed that I did not have a reservation. It was literally two minutes after I called that I had this exchange. The person on the phone explained that calls from the restaurant were made to confirm reservations yet my call back didn't mean anything. I was told I didn't have a reservation and they couldn't accommodate my original request. Not sure how they didn't have my information down yet I received a call back. I was then told to come in and show my call log to prove my reservation. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"The BEST new spot for sushi and japanese food in general!!! Very cool vibe and authentic japanese food... MUST TRY even if you're not in the area!!"}
{"text":"This place is no bueno. The food is bad, the service is bad. I have never had teriyaki or fried rice that tasted that bad. The gyoza was OK but nothing special and really annoying for the price. There hot pots are also horrible."}
{"text":"Any restaurant that would post a rude message about children crying in their restaurant should not be in business. Posting a sign instructing parents how to discipline their children probably isn't a smart move. \"Take them outside if they make a loud noise\" really?"}
{"text":"I gotta say this place impressed me. Came in for some himachi sashimi and it was very, very, impressive! The fish was so fresh and delicious. You can tell right from the color that it's really good quality sashimi. Ken took care of me and the service was absolutely incredible too! I enjoyed the calm tranquil venue as well. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have come to Sushi Sen several times since the business opened and the food is very good. The staff always greets us with a smile and service is good. Sometimes, as with all sushi restaurants, when many orders are placed you have to wait for your sushi. This is a reminder to me to just slow down and enjoy the process. Also their policy regarding noisy children is greatly appreciated. It is a small space, very intimate, so a kid slamming his spoon on the table can really suck. When we raised our son and if he got fussy we would just pick him up and go outside for a few minutes until he was calm so we didn't ruin the other guests experience. It's called courtesy. They make excellent sushi in Arizona not typical of many places in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Japanese restaurant in the Phoenix area. They have a great menu with lots of authentic items. They do everything very well and the sushi is outstanding. It is now my go to place for sushi and Japanese food. Sen is also very quaint family run eatery with fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place was great! The atmosphere walking up is so nice! I wish they had our door seating for the fall-spring seasons because that'd be perfect. Sushi was fresh tasting and the pricing was excellent."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal at Sushi Sen. The spicy tuna and crazy roll were really tasty. I also ate this sweet tofu thing wrapped in rice. Not bad at all! The restaurant is small and the atmosphere was cool. I'll definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Was here on a Thursday night and arrived at about 7pm and it was packed. The place is very small. Took about 15 minutes to get seated. The waitress took a long time to get us menus and seated other people with menus. Had to ask my 11 year nephew to go get menus and the sushi menu so we can figure out what we wanted so we could order right away because it was like if we didn't order when the waitress got there we would not get serviced. We had chicken curry, spicy tuna rolls, yellow tuna and chunky salmon, which was good. The service is very slow and poor. The curry came out in about 10minutes but the sushi came out between 1:05 to 1:15. Be ready to wait a long time for the sushi especially if it is the rolls. While we were there there was also an old guy who confronted a family with a crying child. Obviously, no patience and never had kids and caused a scene in the restaurant. They almost got into a fight at the restaurant. So if you want to see some action, come to this place. If you have a lot of time and can wait, this is the place to be for good sushi, but if you are in a rush, go somewhere else. It seems they only had one sushi chef or something and with the 3 waitresses they have, it wasn't enough."}
{"text":"Tried this place for Sunday lunch. Came at 12:30 and by 1 it was filled. Fresh sushi with tasty rice. Decent ramen, although not the best I've ever had. Chirorushi bowl my husband ordered was full of fish and better than he expected. Service was quick. Decor cute and updated."}
{"text":"We've come here twice now, and have been very impressed both times! The restaurant is cute, clean, and feels very welcoming. I lived in Japan for 2 years, and I've struggled to find an authentic Japanese restaurant in the Valley- now I'm very excited to have found this gem! The employees are kind and very attentive throughout your dining experience. I heard one of the staff (I think she may be the owner) speaking in Japanese to a few of her customers- and she was very polite and sweet. The food is delicious- the seafood is fresh, and the dishes are prepared with care. We've gotten a range of food from gyoza, shrimp and veggie tempura, numerous sushi dishes, ramen, and curry... and each meal was clean, robust with flavor, and delicious! I highly recommend coming here, and we will be regulars for certain. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"With promising reviews and recommendations I was excited to try this place. Unfortunately, it was far from what I expected. To begin with, the service was slow and it took forever for them to take our order. Our meals didn't come out at the same time so I awkwardly ate my mediocre food while my husband watched hungry. Then after eating and waiting for his meal to come I awkwardly watched him eat his mediocre meal. I don't foresee going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"thats the best sushi I ever had in AZ lol first try and they have the sea urchin that I always wanted , will come back"}
{"text":"Worst sushi place ever.  Waited over an hour for a to go order that they said would take 30 minutes. And when I voiced my concern about the issue, the manager responded \"do you need the food or do you not need the food\".  What bullshit.  Never again.  Don't care how \"good\" the food supposedly is"}
{"text":"Their discrimination against families is enough to make me never spend a dime here. We were excited about a new sushi place but unfortunately won't be eating here"}
{"text":"Great authentic, under priced Japanese restaurant, we would pay 3 x more in California. Service is excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Never got the chance to even try the food as we were \"greeted\" by the owner pointing to a sign in the window saying that children and babies would be asked to leave if they cry. I am a grandparent who does not always dine with my one year old granddaughter, but this night we were. Won't be giving this place any of my business."}
{"text":"Sushi in Scottsdale is not good-I said it.  A couple of spots are decent and we all know which ones. This place is something a bit special for Scottsdale-Japanese owned and operated. Please do yourself a favor and stick with the specials. Great new spot and perhaps the best in town. Try the Negi Toro handroll-incredible! Sushi Sen deserves to be on your short list/only list if you love sushi and have had it outside AZ. Great spot."}
{"text":"Great sushi and setting. The roll menu is really creative the sushi is super fresh. Food came out fairly quickly on a busy Saturday night and didn't have any complaints. I was super happy to see Gomae on the menu. I never see it in California and it's an old fave from when I lived in Vancouver. Yay!

One funny thing at the end of the meal was that we couldn't get a bill to pay and leave. For the life of us we couldn't flag any of the ladies down. Had to head to the front desk to pay."}
{"text":"The sushi here is not the greatest and the teriyaki chicken was extremely salty and rubbery . I asked for well done chicken an it was not good at all .. the waitress was not very happy and it took an hour to get the last sushi roll . We were not very happy with this visit"}
{"text":"We were super impressed by the pricing of this place. We got 4 rolls and miso soup and the total came out to about $40. At the place we had been going, we got the same thing and we're paying $60. Very clean, nice staff, and great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, attentive staff, and beautiful atmosphere. Fish was fresh and some of them even came straight from Japan! I would even dare say that the quality is on par with Hiro's in Scottsdale.Everything we ate here was and presented nicely. Juicy, tender, tasty and sushi that melts in your mouth is all we asked for. The intimate ambiance and casual decor made it a nice place to celebrate or spend time with friends or family."}
{"text":"Yum! Found this place by chance when we drove by it. the storefront isn't facing the road, you have to go inside the shopping center. We got sat pretty quickly and the sushi was awesome!! Love that they have a lot of veggie roll options. The soba noodles were really good, I def want to try the ramen next time. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for awesome sushi."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS.  Legit Japanese sushi!  They even have natto and yummy Uni! I got the chefs choice chirashi tonight which had THE BEST toro and Giant clam...!   Fresh wasabi too!  I visit from CA and stay in Scottsdale so I can be close to Sen!  One more thing...the negative reviews from people that have issue with the note re: controlling kids...seriously??"}
{"text":"Always delicious and fresh food! I come here on a regular basis and it's scrumptious. Take advantage of there $5 menu, all week long."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!  Truly authentic Japanese!  We lived in Japan and it brings us back by being there. The staff is so kind and the food is so delicious.  We look forward to going back soon and frequently."}
{"text":"Great hidden sushi gem in Scottsdale. Small, brightly lit and spartan inside. Not a romantic setting. But that's not the goal. Sushi is fresh, plentiful and presented beautifully. Service was attentive and excellent. Portions were unusually generous for sushi of this quality and paired with the reasonable prices makes this an outstanding dining value. Makes other \"show off\" sushi restaurants near by look way overpriced just for vibe. They have beer and a good sake list as well as fill bar. Highly recommend this place for no nonsense sushi in a modest setting."}
{"text":"Their vegetarian options are terrible. Why make a miso broth with pork broth? I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow!  My husband and I stopped in last night and had sushi, ramen and beer.  They were running a $5 special on a special California roll and shrimp roll.  Each roll was typical, but then were topped with fresh baked scallops and fish.  It was incredible!  The service is great.  The place is very simple and casual.  I highly recommend this place.  It is tucked away in the back of an outdoor retail plaza."}
{"text":"The best in Scottsdale. Worth any wait and every penny. Genuine Japanese food and great quality as well!

Growing up in a Japanese household makes you picky when it comes to Japanese food- even when you live in the desert. So glad Sushi Sen is nearby!"}
{"text":"Five stars hands down for the chirachi bowl! The fish was fresh,the sushi rice had the right amount of vinegar. Overall, i was in heaven. Agedashi tofu was solid. I actually went bk two days later, but the ramens my friend and I tried did not live up to my high expectation. Spicy miso ramen could have more flavor and depth to the broth, while the black garlic oil ramen could be less salty. I will still go bk to try more dishes since the chirachi bowl was really impressive!"}
{"text":"We had an early dinner. So we had both happy hour and off the regular menu. Everything was delicious. Service was a little slow. And they brought the food out almost all at once. 
The Sashimi,especially the salmon and the albacore were special. We also had hamachi collar,spicy Tuna Roll and salmon skin salad. All good.
Hiro is better, but this works. Small intimate place. Reserve if you go on a Fri or Sat.


That's it for me at Sushi Sen. we were regulars for the past 6 months.But no more. They bring out the whole order all at once. We tell them about it and they don't listen. If you go, tell them to pace it. 
Food is good not great, but very convenient. But Sushi Hiro is too."}
{"text":"Sushi Sen has all the makings of a good sushi restaurant, but the quality didn't quite cut it into the 4star region for me. Overall it's a 3.5star, including the nice ambiance and good service. 

The inside has a cozy yet casual ambiance for either a dressier night out or just a more comfortable place for sushi. There is sushi bar seating as well as table seating, and there's a huge flat screen television behind the sushi bar. Prices are reasonable. There is plenty of parking in the big lot outside, although the restaurant is tucked into the middle of a maze of storefronts, so it initially took me a bit to find. 

Ikura and whelk nigiri:
These were pretty good, and I thought that the ikura was fresh and whelk interesting. I hadn't had whelk nigiri too much before, maybe once or twice, and it tasted like a more lean mirugai with that same briny flavor and crunchy texture. The sushi rice was made well and the nigiri held together nicely.

Dynamite Roll:
This roll was fine, and I liked that there was baked seafood on too. The roll itself wasn't super well constructed though, and it fell apart very easily. The shrimp and crab on top were baked well, but the fish was super over-baked and its texture was like chewing straw. 

White tuna tataki roll:
The cucumber in the roll below really gave this dish a refreshing kick. The white tuna was good, but the over-dousing of ponzu really overwhelmed all the other flavors. Good if you love ponzu, not so good if we're talking about balancing flavors.

Nabeyaki udon:
I was surprised by the light but pleasing flavor of this udon. The noodles were cooked well, the portion was large, and I liked the pickled cucumber and chili pepper (in such a cute container too) that came with it. 

Sashimi for 1-2 people:
Different sizes of sashimi are offered depending on the number of people, and my guest and I opted for the smallest platter. The portion was decently generous, but the fish itself was pretty lackluster. I appreciated the two slices of toro, which were good, as well as the three slices of hamachi, but the other offerings were disappointing. The tuna and albacore both had a rather strong fishy aftertaste, the halibut was stringy, and the escolar had tiny bones still in it (two pieces!). 

Beef curry with rice:
Japanese curry is pretty uniform across the board, and the flavor was as expected in this dish. The rice was fragrant, but I would have preferred that the curry be a little thicker. The beef was braised to a dark color and didn't have much taste of its own outside of the curry. 

Overall I think Sushi Sen is a decent place for a meal out, but I may shy away from the sashimi and rolls to opt for their udon or entrees instead."}
{"text":"After seeing several check ins by my trusted Yelp friends a few months ago, I bookmarked here to try. Then my colleague said the menu is very much like Sushi Ken in Chandler, is this a spin off? I had to try here after checking out their menu.

Much smaller than Sushi Ken, decor is much more upscale and liked their ambiance here. I had to ask a server. She said after selling Sushi Ken to another owner, he opened a new restaurant here. That explain about their menu.

Considering price and portion size, this restaurant makes it so affordable to eat out daily. May not be the best food, they offer so many variety of comfort food.

I tried their ramen and mini chirashi combo. Huge portion size, I ended up skipping dinner as I was still full from lunch.

Now they are lot closer to my house, looking forward to coming back here to try more"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try our new neighborhood sushi place! After waiting at the hostess desk for 5 minutes (with staff walking by multiple times), a woman finally directed me and my 1 year old daughter (who was behaving like an angel) back out front of their restaurant and pointed to a sign which stated they have had several incidents with customers with children and that if my daughter were to cry or make a loud noise, I would be asked to take her outside until she settled down (see picture). By the time I had read the sign, the woman was already back inside. Safe to say we did not have dinner here and will clearly not be back, nor will our friends or neighbors!"}
{"text":"After a ride on the train across the street we ventured here for sashimi. The decor is warm, simple and cute. 

We ordered a plate of chefs choice of mixed fish. Omg the albacore (white tuna ) was so delicious it just melted in my mouth. I sampled the yellowtail and it was also fresh and flavorful. We will definitely return again the savor the sushi.

The service was slow and only two people preparing the sushi when the restaurant was at capacity. We will overlook the long wait because the food was so good."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this new sushi spot and was really impressed with the price points and food! Excellent attentive service and friendly staff. Food ordered: pork katsu don buri (excellently prepared and tasted great), combo order of beef curry and tonkatsu ramen soup (both were excellent dishes with solid flavors). We also got the spicy tuna roll that was on special which was tasty as well (they have $5 special rolls nightly). Good portion size and flavor, we will be back again to try more off of their extensive menu!"}
{"text":"Basically this restaurant is only good for Happy Hour.  The off Happy rolls are outrageously priced. We were there for dinner on a Saturday night.  I have to say that $9.00 for a Chunky Spicy Tuna Roll is a bit much plus $1.00 up-charge for Brown Rice.  Never really did get the up-charge thing for Brown Rice.  It happens everywhere at most Sushi places but as I write this review I feel the need to vent.  Really?  Are we being up-charged as an inconvenience to the establishment for making us Brown Rice?  It's allegedly healthier so I get it.  Happens to us everywhere.  So now lets talk about the Ramen Soup.  The broth itself is mediocre.  The dish is sparsely populated with sprouts and guess what?  Yes...we asked for cabbage (you could barely see it) and there was an up-charge.  We are not talking bankruptcy here but if I keep ordering extra's I just may need a loan.  I don't understand the little bowl versus big bowl thing with the soup.  Is that supposed to plant the thought that this dish is SO big it's shareable? Overall this was a bad choice.  The other dish ordered was Shrimp Fried Rice.  We asked to add jalapeno and to make it with Brown Rice (healthy right?).  Up-charge city goes without saying.  Let's talk about the portion size--beyond meager...and served on a flat plate. Why not a bowl? The size of the shrimp was next up from salad size, the dish was super oily,  and what kind vegetables were included?  The kitchen must be warned to slice and dice extra small to make sure the customer cannot identify the vegetables.  Horrible meal.  Will never go back.  I need to mention one more item and it is a personal thing.  Even though the staff was nice, the vibe in this restaurant is sterile and borders on the possibility of making sure they project the fact that zero personality is the new friendly.  Perhaps that is mean spirited but I like a little atmosphere.  Lastly, I leave future patrons with this...this restaurant tries to portray something for everyone.  I say stick to the Sushi and for the hours of Happy Hour only."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pleasant, the staff is pleasant and accommodating, and the price is reasonable within the context of Scottsdale. The food however, while edible and ample, is bland, inexpertly prepared, and a frankly sad imitation of Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Decided to change things up from our usual local japanese spots and I was not disappointed. Sushi Sen is truly a hidden gem in the heart of Scottsdale, not to mention that it's Japanese owned and operated and has an authentic feel to it. The menu is extensive, but you can't go wrong with any of the options. Tried out the tonkatsu ramen and the flavor was perfect. Since my visit was on a Saturday night, things were kinda hectic, but the staff was very warm and welcoming. There's also a cute outside seating area which is the perfect place to have dinner on a cool evening."}
{"text":"Openly discriminates against families! See sign at the door upon entry! Find another place to spend your hard-earned money!"}
{"text":"Went to eat here with the family since it was right across the street from Stillman Railroad Park. Ordered from the happy hour menu (pretty small list but if it's good no worries I always think). Got the tempura roll, calamari tempura, baked roll, dynamite roll and salmon skin roll. The first of the dishes came out fast. Cooked really well and had just the right ratio of rice. The calamari tempura was the shining part of the night as it was not chewy at all. Had the night ended this was it probably would have been a 4 if not 5 star review. The road started to decline once we waited for our last roll the salmon skin. Other customers walked in received their orders...then their secondary wave of orders and our salmon skin roll still didn't come. I asked the waiter and they said it's on it's way. After another long wait asked that if it's not ready no worries as my kids were getting restless. They asked that we wait even longer. It finally came but by then my kids were ultra restless. Sorry to say but I'll likely not return as in situations like this you either comp the long waited dish or just have the check ready and apologize. Next please!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to try this restaurant based on the fact they have a policy regarding disruptive children. So frustrating to try and have a nice night out only to have it ruined by screaming children and parents that are oblivious to the disruptive nature of the noise and commotion!"}
{"text":"Terrible, the fish is MUSHY. Obviously not fresh. I have never had mushy fish, but both my sashimi and tuna roll were terrible and the yellow tail smelled and tasted like it had been rinsed in  nasty pond water.  Even the rice is disappointing. It's not sushi rice, it's just steamed rice."}
{"text":"Decided to give Sushi Sen a try w the family.  Between the 5 of us, we ordered agadashi tofu, two types of ramen, chicken katsu curry, pork gyoza, white fish roll, chunky yellowtail roll and a salmon teriyaki.  The tonkatsu ramen was by far our favorite.  Salmon teriyaki, Agadashi tofu and chunky yellowtail were also excellent.  Other items were good but not amazing. This is definitely our new local Japanese favorite for days when you don't feel like breaking the bank at Roka Akor or Yasu.  I appreciated all of the menu options given the diversity of the eaters I travel with!"}
{"text":"I came to visit because of the high ratings, but left disappointed. The sushi was eh - it lacked any good flavor and really dry. I had the dynamite roll, the langostino roll and the shrimp tempura roll. Honestly, all rolls tasted the same. I also ordered a seaweed salad and that was the best part of my meal. The ambiance and atmosphere I really liked though."}
{"text":"The sushi here is super good. We got the sushi Combo C plate and the pork ramen soup. All of it was amazing. Highly suggest!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a 5 star experience. Sushi is high quality and very fresh. Came in for happy hour today and was very impressed. Had various nigiri sushi and a salmon skin salad. The rolls I had were excellent and they were fine with adjusting order to avoid mayo allergies . Service was reasonably paced and extremely friendly. Can't wait to come back to Scottsdale next time to try some other things. Best of luck, you're off to a good start."}
{"text":"Sushi ken is back!! We were so bummed when the original in Ahwautukee changed owners and the food quality dropped. We accidentally found that they had moved into the old shin bay space (beautiful). The same staff, food,  prices (!). We looove this place and still has that neighborhood feel in an upscale location."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant less than one star I would. The service was extremely slow and the food was disgusting. The sushi was warm. The rolls were not rolled properly. They kept falling apart which made them difficult to eat. I had to stop eating because I was afraid I was going to get sick."}
{"text":"I am so happy to see my favor Japanese restaurant open again in Scottsdale. I love them so much! Good quality! Good job!!!!"}
{"text":"nice food, very fresh sashimi & sushi. love the way they made their sushi with a giant piece of fish on top and  little rice on the bottom. ordered a udon for my kids, the texture of the udon is so nice and chewy too.  nice & clean place, as like most of the japanese restaurant, it's very clean, all tables n chairs, china & utensils are all so clean. good service, most of the servers there were all friendly and nice. the first server approaching us was a tiny asian woman, who handed us the menus, she explained every each menu to us in details. and the japanese male server did come to us and check on us too. however, theres one of the servers there, a tall female server, with a long black pony tail. she was very rude, not approachable, and mean. i was asking for the market price for the uni that night, she rolled her eyes and looked at the board on the wall and gave me the price. was like telling me: dont you read?! and when i asked for another question, she didnt even wanna continued to talk to me anymore, and she asked another server to come and take my order.  well, i didn't know what i do wrong?! i felt like i'm paying for discomfort to dine in there. pretty upset about it."}
{"text":"I moved from Manhattan to Phoenix in January 2017, and since then I've been on the hunt for a great sushi restaurant and finally (and happily) I've found it! The quality of rice for the rolls is amazing--yes, something as simple as good sushi rice has been hard to find here. And the fish is fantastic. Honestly, the genuine simplicity of this place is what makes it so good. No over-the-top rolls like so many other places trying to blind you with subpar fish but a bunch of frills. If you truely enjoy good sushi you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!!  I have brought my young children here and they absolutely love it too!!  So thankful to have such a lovely family place around and never once did we have to deal with anyone yelling, screaming, or crying.  There is a lovely sign out front that advises everyone entering that they do not tolerant disturbances of any kind from anyone.  The food is amazing and the service is impeccable.  Cannot wait to take my family back there!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in AZ. Fresh and delicious. Great service too. Will be returning..."}
{"text":"At very least you have to try their happy hour. The standard rolls have a little more creativity, the prices are reasonable and their dishes are great tasting. So try 5 dollar happy hour."}
{"text":"Tried this place out after reading the many good yelp reviews. We went during happy hour and the place was packed. We got seated fairly quickly and was greeted by our waitress. She took our order at 6:20pm and we did not get any of our food until 7:30pm. Despite the long wait, the sushi was very well made and good.  Knowing that they had just opened, I hope that they get more sushi chefs or maybe work out the kinks so that there wouldn't be over an hour wait just to get 3 rolls."}
{"text":"This place was great!  Great $5 sushi happy hour specials, but decently priced otherwise.  I got the spicy yellowtail roll and the rainbow roll and the fish was very fresh, and the sushi rice was perfectly cooked. Will go again next next I am in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and happy hours. They have a wide variety of sushi and to my surprise a good variety of ramen. $5 rolls during lunch and happy hour, the rolls are better than your spicy tuna rolls or california rolls that are typically on specials. I ordered the tuna takaki rolls for $5 lunch has solid tuna inside and chunks marinaded tuna chunks on top. I went for both lunch specials and happy hour. The ramen base was favorful and the noodles were on point. My fav is the spicy miso base and you can get chicken instead of pork for a meat. The charsiu broth was on the saltier side for me I prefer spicy miso. All their broth are pork base. The only complaint is that I like spicy food and there no spice here. You ask for spice and they bring you pepper flakes and siracha sauce which is a FAIL for me and the eggs tends to be overcooked. Not enough to write them off, thr flavors are there. I just plan on bringing my own      hot chili peppers when I want ramen. This is the reason for 4 stars and not 5."}
{"text":"We had a really good lunch at this restaurant.  We had a sampling of 5 different rolls and they were very tasty and fresh.  3 of the rolls we had were on special which was great too.  We were so impressed we are going back tonight for round 2."}
{"text":"Ten to Ken to Sen...I will follow them, follow them wherever they may go....

I love sushi! It's just got that earthy fish taste, but not like a stinky fishy taste. When you get any sashimi and it's buttery, it's heavenly. Mmm mmm good! 

They have an awesome happy hour menu that offers quality in quantity. Just because it's happy hour doesn't mean you get less here. And everything tastes fresh to me. A couple of the things I get during HH is their white tuna tataki and some salmon sashimi...at least 2.

And then if I'm feeling a bit chilly, can't deny their ramen. 

I love their yellowtail hamachi! I've been ordering this for years! They may not always have it, but luckily I have been lucky enough to get one when I crave it. 

That's just a few things I've devoured.  Check out their menu....plenty to order from....rice bowls, noodles, sushi, and more!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  We have been going there very often since we discovered it in summer 2017.  Sushi Sen is like eating in a mom-and-pop restaurant in the back streets of Tokyo.  They have such a large menu offering from sushi, bento to sukiyaki and every thing in between. 

All the ingredients are so fresh and that the ratio of fish and rice in sushi is perfect.  Just a good bite size and not too much rice.  We enjoyed each time dinning there, food, service and the atmosphere are all wonderful!  

Sushi Sen is busy, almost all the time!  My husband and I went on a Wednesday night, around 8am,  thinking they will be quiet.  WRONG!  Every table was taken and we sat at the sushi bar.

Every one worked there is super friendly and attentive.  Food is definitely authentic.  I highly recommend Sushi Sen to all sushi lovers!  Call in advance for reservation for weekends."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC sushi and sashimi. A BEAUTIFUL broth with Udon... Priced right. Given the price point, the food exceeds expectations. Sushi rice is spot on fresh and perfect. Lovely service. I should have dined there instead of Roka Akor the night before, where the prices made my skin crawl when you look at what is being served. Fish is fresh and plentiful. Nice job guys!"}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding! From the freshness of the fish to the flavors of the ramen. The tofu is served in a bowl with this perfect sauce that complements it so well. The portion sizes are hearty and the service is great. This is a great place for any occasion."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for the first time tonight for dinner. What a wonderful place! The menu is extensive, the servers were all wonderful, and the ambience was just right. The music was playing softly in the background so we were able to converse without having to talk over the music. Loud music in restaurants seems to be the standard these days so finding a place that doesn't have the music blaring is so nice. We like to take my father out for dinner occasionally but with his poor hearing every dinner outing turns into a frustrating event! Based on the music at this place alone we have decided we will take him here for Father's Day!

Oh and the sushi! It was so fresh and so delicious and the prices were reasonable, especially for Scottsdale. I definitely will be back again to try out their lunch menu as well.

One more thing, their picture menu is so reminiscent of my time in Japan, I felt like I was in a small restaurant in Tokyo.

Trust me, this is a hidden gem and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Perfect for a quick lunch, snack or romantic meal for two. The rainbow roll I ordered looked really appetizing and tasted delicious! The atmosphere was very welcoming, clean and modern. Service was good. Menu has a good  variety of options. Prices are reasonable and they have some specials as well as a happy hour."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that a new Japanese restaurant opened up close by. We decided to visit the same day I read about it. We got there around 6 pm on Saturday. There were a few tables filled already. One thing we did notice was a smell. We couldn't place it though. Kinda fishy, kinda like cleaner? Anyways. 

The staff was very friendly and attentive. We arrived during happy hour (goes til 630). We ordered some salmon sashimi, which was good. The miso was good/normal, but the cucumber salad was lacking in flavor. 

We also ordered the chicken karage, which I have been craving for a while. It was just ok (flavor wise and tenderness). We asked for some mayo to go with it and it tasted better. 

The tonkatsu ramen was okay. The broth was not as rich as others that I've had, but the pork was tender and flavorful. 

The pork katsu curry was a bit disappointing, as the curry sauce didn't have much flavor and was quite watery. The pork was fried well though! 

All in all, it was okay. Perhaps still refining recipes since they just opened? They do have a wide selection on their menu, so I would say, give it a try! But we were a bit disappointed that our favorite dishes weren't as awesome as we hoped."}
{"text":"After moving here from Japan three months ago I finally found a real Japanese restaurant complete with sushi Katsu and a friendly JAPANESE staff!

You can't go wrong with this place.  Take it from me I lived in Japan for over two decades the food is authentic and delicious and the service is exactly what you would expect in Japan.  Five stars I must go for anybody craving real Japanese food! Top it off with a nice bottle of Asahi The worlds best lager!   

Took my uncle there and we really enjoyed ourselves! Super friendly staff I will be back"}
{"text":"Good. Not great. Just ordinary. Tonkotsu Ramen was boring. Sashimi was ok. Dessert looked ok but didn't try it."}
{"text":"This is above and beyond my absolute favorite Sushi Restaurant in Scottsdale.

The quality and consistency of the food is phenomenal, and we've always received nothing but exceptional Customer Service from the family. 

We recommend the White Tuna Tataki Rolls and the Miso Butter Ramen (my personal favorite!)

The rolls are reasonably priced and very very filling. 

You can fill up on 5 Huge Rolls of House Specialty Sushi and still leave under $30!

We love this place, and we know you will too!"}
{"text":"It's not cool that they treat people badly if there is a child present. Refusing to seat people because they have a one year old and you assume the child won't behave is downright terrible. Think before you publish signs and treat people like they have a disease just because they have a child. Unacceptable behavior equals 1 star."}
{"text":"What a nice little hidden Sushi place in the middle of Scottsdale in Phoenix, Arizona! We were pleasantly surprised!
Clean, Modern, Fresh Fish, good selection of Sake, very friendly hosts, yummy sushi rolls. Spicy chunky yellow tail, white spicy tuna, scallops and fatty yellow tail were great!
And we didn't get a chance to check out the specials, so we'll be back!
Great prices too!
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. This was a nice replacement to Shin Bay which was also a great place. The service was a bit slow but the fish was super fresh and the menu was huge. Great lunch specials. Not cheap, but worth it."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst experience at a restaurant. I ordered salads, sushi, and sushimi. The sushi came out about 20 minutes after we ordered 10 minutes after that the salads came out and 1.5 hours the sushimi came out after I complained that I never received my personal meal and then one server said it was cancelled then 10 minutes later they bring it out and tried to charge me half off. Then when I declined again they sold my
Dinner to the table next to for full price! Shit was wild never again 

Oh and did i forget to mention that two other tables that sat next to us were sat after us and received their menus, drinks and food way before we did."}
{"text":"Such a great vibe. My husband and I enjoy trying new sushi places- as we are always looking for the \"just right\" place. Sushi Sen is clean, quaint, and delicious! I liked that Sushi Sen offers a different spin on a few of my favorite rolls! The Dynamite California roll was my favorite and full of so much yummy fish! Everything was fresh, cold (salmon & tuna rolls) and super tasty! Our waitress was kind and smiley.. she was also knowledgeable about the rolls we ordered. I can't wait to return and take our daughter! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Great deals happening right now. With all the amazing deals, I ordered WAY too much food, but was happy to try a bunch of things. The tonkatsu ramen is really delicious. The noodles had a good chew and the broth was rich but not overpowering. They give you proper spices along with your ramen to allow you to season it to your preferred level of spiciness. I've tried ramen at a few different spots across the country, and this ranks in my top three. The sushi was less of a hit for me. While decent, it wasn't a knock out of the park. The raw fish didn't amaze me, and I felt the assembly was rushed. The rolls kept falling apart as I was bringing them to my mouth and the balance of ingredients was off. For example some pieces were 90% avocado, some pieces had nearly zero avocado, within the same roll. 

I'll be back for the ramen and to try other things!"}
{"text":"Best sushi not only in all of Phoenix, but in all of the US. I've lived on the east and west coast and never through the best sushi I would ever had in the continental US would come from Phoenix."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this sushi restaurant because it's walking distance from our apartment. We were not let down! The fish was so fresh and clean tasting! The sauces were incredible and we left satisfied and impressed. We ordered soft shell crab (crispy and fresh), various tuna and yellowtail sushi and rolls (some of the best I've had) and fresh water eel (served hot and crispy). The miso ramen was also incredibly flavorful and hearty. Everything was A+. Will return again...and again...and again."}
{"text":"Sushi Sen is my new favorite Japanese restaurant. 
It took a while to understand the menu because they give you lot of different combination options. 

I ordered the bento dinner combination which gives you choice of 3 different items (one from each group). I chose sushi, tako poke and hamachi Kama. Everything was delicious and fresh. Hamachi Kama was huge size and it was so juicy and plump. 

Hubby ordered the chirashi. There is a chirashi option to choose 5 different fish but the waiter recommended their preset chirashi which was slightly higher priced. I'm so glad he did because there were so many variety of fish including mirugai, halibut, unagi, and toro (I think). For the amount of fish on this entree it was worth every penny (and then some). Did I mention how fresh it was?? It was the best we've had in Arizona. 

My son ordered the noodle combination which he chose tonkatsu ramen with tempura donburi. The ramen had really good broth and the noodle was cooked perfectly. It was perfect meal on its own. The tempura donburi I was extra impressed with. I'm not sure how they made the sauce for this dish but it was so yummy. It was kind of sauce I wanted to eat just with white rice. It was best ramen and tempura donburi I've tasted in Arizona.

The staff were very friendly and service was prompt. They close at 9:30 and we saw customers still walking in. They still welcomed them. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"New little Sushi Ramen joint that opened up down the street. This is only their second week in business and they do a very good job with their Sushi and ramen. They also have daily specials. Today they have their Tonkotsu Ramen bowl for $5 and 6 sushi rolls for $5 each as well. The $5 sushi rolls are highlighted in Orange and the below picture. They also have happy hour Mon-Sat 5 to 6:30. Which has nigiri rolls Sashimi appetizers and drink specials. Call ranging from $3.50 to $7.50. Overall a nice spot. Will definitely be coming back to try other items."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!!! This is about the first time I've ever gotten full off of sushi. I'm not a \"true\" sushi eater, so I had the Crunchy Onion CA roll and the Shrimp Tempura rolls. Both were great. 

I came by myself to get a quick late \"lunch\" before I picked up my kids from preschool. I'll definitely be back!! I'm definitely going to be telling my husband about this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out of hamachi Kama combo. The portion was large and the food was very tasty! The quality of food is even better than before when they ran sushi ken."}
{"text":"OK so recently coming from Austin, Texas where I was spoiled with Ramen Tatsu-ya and Michi Ramen I was jonesin' for a place to find good ramen and that is also KID friendly because my kid picked up the ramen gene from me, too.  Introducing Sushi Sen.  Conveniently located across from the park of all railroad parks, the McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park and walking distance from 21 Cakes (if you have kids these are both a must do/have) Sushi Sen offers the best Ramen options!  Their spicy miso ramen is amazing and they also offer the chili pepper flakes which I add to make it sweaty hot.  If you need something more substantial: hot pot is great for winter, (although I will eat any time) and they offer some of the best sashimi I have ever had.   What I especially love is their friendliness to families (read: little kids) and always great service.  Pay attention to their hours so you don't arrive when they are closed.  Kanpai!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Was in town for the week and went twice for lunch. Both times I had salmon roll, avocado roll, and caterpillar roll. Everything was delicious. Salmon was so fresh! Miso soup was amazing. Great service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for lunch the other day. They have fantastic lunch specials, which include $5 drinks and rolls. We ordered three rolls off the lunch menu. All three were delicious! They were much better than I was expecting, based on the menu description. The staff was friendly and attentive. We sat on the patio, which was delightful on the gorgeous Spring day. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday around 1. It's tucked away but easy to find. Loved the look of the restaurant and there was a steady flow of people. We were immediately greeted and seated. We got a few rolls as they had Happy Hour along with a Miso Butter Ramen. Looked around and noticed everyone had a light green drink. Figured out it was their chilled green tea so I decided to try it. I wasn't wowed but it was okay. They also provide refills. The ramen was tasty. I had been craving good ramen for awhile so this hit the spot. It was a good size. I noticed some people shared the ramen. I, on the other hand, ate the whole thing. Oh yeah, and straight out of that big bowl versus in the small bowl they provided. Hehe. Did I mention I was craving ramen? The one disappointment was the egg in the ramen. It was simply a hard boiled egg. Wish they would have done more to it. Some places don't cook the yolk through or soak it in a soy sauce. That would have set it off. 

Now, why the four star? When we got our bill we were incorrectly charged for two green teas versus one. When I advised a worker of the mistake, they seemed hesitant to fix it. I gestured over to our table which clearly had three glasses on it (two with water and one with a small amount of tea left). While they adjusted the bill, I felt a little uncomfortable, as if they didn't believe me.  However, with that being said, we'd come back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I found it on Yelp a few weeks ago when I was up in Scottsdale one Saturday and liked it so much I've since had my birthday there and met a business associate there for dinner.  
The servers are super friendly and attentive. It gets a little slow when they are super busy, but it's forgivable. They were really good with the large group on my birthday and split the check perfectly. 
Both the sushi and the food from the kitchen is outstanding. The sushi fish is exceptional quality and very fresh. The fish is very well cut and they are not stingy, even with the more expensive items. 
My whole family loves this place and we will be making the drive from Gilbert frequently."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Huge portions. All Japanese employees. Took a little long to get served but if your not in a rush it's ok."}
