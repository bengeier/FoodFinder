{"text":"After my night at this place, I am having a hard time believing \"Chantelle D's\".  Plus it's pretty creepy how she conveniently outlines all the prices.. and seems to know a little tooo much about the place... but anyway, I digress.   Everyone I know who has been at this place the same time the owner's been there has  a really bad experience. He owner is a maniac and clearly, others on this site think so too! The smallest thing, like asking for an extra straw or clarifying what is in the pizza will get him off!  He barks around orders to other customers and the waitresses. It's painful to watch.   For the safety of his staff and customers, this guy needs to be committed! By the end of the night, we were rushing to get the hell out of there.   I wanted to like this place.. i really did, cause hey, a shisha place next to my house is awesome.  and not going to lie, it looks kinda cool in there.  But because of the owner, I simply cannot continue going there. I've heard too many bad stories.  can't support people who treats others so poorly."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. Wait staff took too long to bring out common items like extra forks, water, etc. Moreover, they did not know much about items on the menu and couldn't answer our questions.  The owner acted obnoxious. He bragged about the food, making statements to the effect that we will never eat better food, but the food clearly did not meet any of our expectations. He kept forcing us to try different food items that were not on the menu, wouldn't tell us what they costed (said, \"don't worry about it, we will take care of you\") and then charged us a bomb for it. Food quantities were very small. Yes, I will say that their pita (the one that comes with a dip) was fresh, tasty and well made.  Here's the most disappointing part: There was a WAGJAG coupon which stated that you get 2 VIP Sheesha's for a party of 4 people maximum. (This is understandable as they didn't want 2 sheesha's and 20 people sharing it.) We went as a group of 8 and had 2 vouchers. Which means, that should have bought us 4 sheeshas. The owner flat out told us that neither of the vouchers will be accepted. When we talked to him, he talked about how they wanted only small groups of people as it was promotional event, and have a \"strict rule\" that states they can not honor the vouchers because we are a party of 8. This was not written anywhere on the voucher and when we asked the waitress that night, she said \"that shouldn't be a problem\" but the owner had a problem with it.  I most definitely didn't understand his logic. So if 4 of my friends sat separately, would he accept the vouchers?!? The bottom line is that because the voucher was expiring in a month (bought it almost a yr ago), he did not want to honour it. His restaurant probably got the publicity he advertised for through wagjag and now he didn't need the additional customers. (No wonder the \"lounge\" was empty at 10pm on a weekend). He did not want to give us two extra sheeshas despite the fact that we order approx. $20+ food each and the coupons were legitimate. He also made a statement to the effect of \"let's see, I'll tell you later if I'll accept it\" based on how much food we ordered. Did he expect us to order 4 sheeshas and then have the liberty to say \"oh I can't accept the vouchers\"?? REALLY??  He raved about how good the smoothies and sheesha is - the smoothies were completely average. The sheesha was somewhat decent (I can make it equally good at home), but very poorly managed. No one provided extra coal, no one cleaned the sheeshas. So by the end of the night, we were smoking cold ash. I had to clean my sheesha myself and ask for coal after which the waitress just came by and put two chunks of coal in my hand. WTH??  Overall a very disappointing experience. I went there with friends to celebrate my friend's birthday (owner knew that) but was very disappointed with the owner and staff. Definitely not going back there again as the only thing a little above average was the sheesha, but the bad customer service make the place completely not worth it. They need a bootcamp session in customer service, they just lost 8 avid sheesha-loving customers over 2 sheeshas :)  Edit: They DO NOT accept credit cards despite the fact that it says so on the restaurant information."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever had, and terrible shisha. The head burned after a couple of puffs, and shisha's were poorly made. Never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"this place is cool. i have been on the hunt for good shisha in Toronto. They serve the herbal stuff even though they say its not herbal. It has a stoner vibe to it. lots of munchies on the menu. the table i was sitting at had a backgammon game"}
{"text":"My friend and I like smoking sheesha occasionally as it was a pastime we enjoyed when we lived briefly in East Africa. We chose this Sheesha bar because I'd passed by it on the street once and it looked inviting, plus the reviews were pretty good.   We went on a Saturday night arriving around 10 p.m. and were instantly settled into two of the comfy white lounge chairs near the front. The mood was great, there was a good mix of people there, but it wasn't too busy and the live jazz musician playing piano and singing set a nice relaxing tone.   We first ordered a VIP Sheesha (uses distilled water and ice) in Watermelon Mint flavour and a pot of Morrocan Tea. The tea was delicious and a good sized pot while the quality of the sheesha was stellar - really enjoyed the flavour as well, which started off with the sweetness of the watermelon, but left a nice minty aftertaste.   The sheesha we ordered lasted us the whole time we where there (around 2 and a half hours) though we're not intense smokers. When we finished the tea we ordered individual hot drinks. She had the latte and I ordered the Belgian Warm Chocolate - it was some of the best hot chocolate I've had in a long time. My only complaint is that it wasn't very big.   I also ordered the poutine and was pleasantly surprised as it was fantastic. I am a huge fan of poutine and almost always try it if it's on the menu but am usually disappointed. The potato wedges they used were great and there was tons of cheese.   The service was good, though slightly slower as the night got busier. Overall, really enjoyed the experience and will definitely go back the next time I'm hit with a sheesha craving. Our shared bill came out to around $45 (including tax, but not tip yet), which wasn't bad, though we didn't order alcohol. The sheesha is definitely more expensive than other places, but also better quality."}
{"text":"I've never had such amazing apple pie. Like. Ever. I can't remember having better apple pie on an apple orchard in rural California where I grew up. The place is quiet and large and I love to work here. If you are looking for a loud, trendy scene you are not going to find it here and boy am I glad. Everything is priced fairly and they free wifi and lots of electrical outlets. It is my favorite place to go to write and work on projects when I am in Toronto. Last February when I was here I came here every day to write and one day my credit card was declined. I didn't have any cash on me and the guy at the register told me I could pay the next day! The waitstaff is incredibly attentive and always makes sure you have enough hot water for your Mighty Leaf (my favorite brand of tea) tea. The sheesha is good,  The hummus is handmade (and acceptable although not exceptional)  but the pita seems to be frozen (I saw the little perforations the telltale mark of machine made food) and the music selection was awesome he was playing some dark circus music plus the guy working last night was really cute."}
{"text":"I went here to grab some food for the night. But it was a big mistake as I had their kebabs. I'm not sure if I'm wrong for going here for food (because they have it on the menu) or if they are wrong to serve food when they may be catering more to a lounge clientele. The lounge had nothing exotic to it considering the fact it was a sheesha lounge by name. Overly disappointing trip we made and had to eat food at a fast food place thereafter."}
{"text":"One of the best Sheesha places in the city I have been to. Me and a friend visited here, we did not know much about the place, and then once we arrived - we were very impressed with the place. Plenty of variety with the sheesha offerings, plus they had multiple dessert and drink options. The seating was comfortable, the couches were laid out in a lounge fashion - it looked high-end compared to the other sheesha places in the city. I would definitely try out the place again."}
{"text":"Nice quiet and relaxing place. Good food, and very chill atmosphere. Waitresses were good too, I'd recommend. There are a lot of sleazy and sketchier shisha bars downtown, but this is not one of them."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a shisha smoker. But during the day this place is a very nice coffeehouse. The server was very nice and the chairs were made of leather and quite comfortable. My friends and I stayed there for a couple of hours and it was a great setting to just chill, relax, and catch up. They also have very good desserts."}
{"text":"Went here for my gf's birthday with about 10 friends. Reserved a booth in the back and service was great - just be careful of what you order as 'premium' drinks can be more than you expect and your bill will be run up quite quickly. Double check you bill before paying! Also, no credit only cash accepted."}
{"text":"It was okay. Very pricy, but the sheesha is good. I went on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty chill. I live in the area and would consider hanging out here more, but the music was ridiculous -- really (really) loud dance & pop music. It was totally inappropriate for the atmosphere, and it was really disruptive to what might otherwise have been a relaxing afternoon."}
{"text":"Underwhelming.  The shishas themselves are not bad at all. However its the other menu items, as well as the overall ambience of the \"lounge\" that are a total let down, especially considering the inflated prices youll be paying.  We ordered two shishas, nachos and 2 caffeinated beverages (cold and hot). The nachos werent good at all. The chicken tasted sweaty like it was marinated under someones armpits, and the cheese and sour cream like it came out of a can that hasnt been used since the Reagan administration. Their \"european press coffee\" tastes like your average timmies or folgers coffee. The FerreroRoche iced drink was pretty good no complaints there.  3 main issues (besides the awful food) really: 1) the seating and overall dim lit atmosphere does not deserve the title of sheesha lounge whatsoever. It feels like youre sitting in some retirees basement suburban house from the 70's. They have tents further down the back which is supposed to give a middle eastern ambience? But fails miserably at doing so. The furniture is extremely generic and layout is poorly thought out. Nothing stands out decor wise. Very poor. 2) they dont serve free water and they only serve it in the bottles as is. Im pretty sure thats somewhat illegal considering we live in a very water rich country. Never in my life have I been to a lounge that serves bottled costco brand water at a paid cost to the customer. 3) They dont accept debit. They insist you use their atm machine. Thats fine until you realize they refund you the atm fee (but your bank doesnt) which beats the whole point of having an in store atm machine (to make a profit off the fees ofcourse).   Wont be visiting or recommending again."}
{"text":"We had looked at the pictures online and since we love shisha, we were really looking forward to this place. We bought coupons online which  clearly stated on the site to be used between a group of 4. Since we had 12 people we bought 3 coupons. The owner of this place was a complete and total asshole. He wouldn't let us use the coupons and basically kept yelling that we were ridiculous for thinking we could use 3 coupons. We basically left the place - but were super glad that we actually left as it was deserted. There were only 2 other people at this so called amazing shisha lounge. If i was the owner and wanted to run a business I would have been a little bit more respectful to the clientele that walked into the doors.   Definitely do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"First off, the setting is quite decent at this place, with some comfy seating and nice lighting. Good for couples or groups of friends. There are even some boardgames like chess you can play. Definitely a sheesha vibe that is relaxed. At Bloor/Ossington, it's not exactly an area I frequent much but it's right by the subway.   On paper, it looks like an amazing combination - a restaurant, sheesha lounge, and cafe ALL in one establishment. They serve gourmet pizzas, salads, coffees, pastries etc. The concept is neat. Went there with three other friends and had a decent time there that allowed for conversation as well as relaxation on a weekday night out.   HOWEVER, my view of the place is definitely biased because I ended up having a chicken wrap there and throwing up violently soon afterwards. Food poisoning symptoms were evident, and it really dampened our plans for the rest of the night. That being said, my other friend had some other food item and was fine (I believe it was a pizza).   I suppose I was unlucky with the chicken and it may have been a one-time incident. BUT, if I ever think of coming back, the food poisoning incident will always affect my judgment."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. I had a really good time here. It's a really good place to come and hang out with friends. I never knew what sheesha was and now, I love it and want to go back and smoke more. Their menu has a lot of selection, which I like very much, especially for vegetarians. I had their hummus and pita, oh my! It was the best. I definitely want to try other items on the menu. The pizza looked really good. The staff was really friendly and attentive. Overall it was a fun experience for me. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Disgusting! I went here with a friend and everything seemed okay until the waiter brought the sheesha. He was actually sucking on it before he gave it to us, gross! He never even asked us if we wanted him to light it for us and when he brought it I had to ask for mouth guards.  That really pissed me off afterward. Who does he think he is!? This place is really unprofessional and not the kind of place you want to bring someone for a nice time. I would recommend getting a root canal over the service in this place.  I've even written to the Ministry of Health as they serve food and alcohol. Who know's what goes on in the kitchen?! I shudder to think it. EW!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight to meet with a friend for some shisha and some good conversation with friends - this place delivers on all fronts!   It's a super chill location just a stones throw away from Ossington and Bloor (and even closer to the McDonald's).   They have a pretty decent selection of beer, nothing crazy, but let's be honest you're not really coming here for beer or cocktails.   The vibe and music are super chill, just an endless loop of trance music playing over and over again. The decor is pretty nice as well, with ample comfy chairs everywhere.  For our hookah session we went with the VIP which comes loaded with ice, lemon juice and water in the base. We added milk for an extra $5 which made for an even smoother smoke.   Definitely planning on returning and being a regular."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm signing up on this website just to make sure this place has a glowing review.   I went last week with a couple of friends. At first we thought the atmosphere was a little off, and the decor a little outdated, but whatever... we're not going there to be the toast of the town, we're going there to have a good time and smoke some good sheesha. I had the Double Apple while my friends shared a Grape. I hate sheesha that all tastes the same. The flavours here are distinct and delicious, and they burn for a long time (2-3 hours with constant pulls). You totally get your money's worth.   I didn't have any of their traditional (Middle Eastern) food while I was there, but I did have a salad. The produce was fresh, tasted great, and had a side of some of the best hummus I've ever had.   When we got up to pay, the owner was at the till, and we spoke to him for 15 minutes about some of his businesses practices, where he gets his sheesha, and his connections in Chicago, a town that he clearly has a passion for. He's a pretty passionate guy, and seems to love what he does.   I plan on going back, in fact I plan on going back a LOT. Smoking sheesha is something fun and unique to do with your friends if you're looking to get out of the \"Lets-go-for-coffee\" trap. This is unique, affordable ($15.99 - $17.99 for literally HOURS of sitting around socializing). Food is moderately priced, great desert selection.   You will leave feeling great! The owner pumps oxygen into the room, so after about 20 minutes of sitting down with your friends, you'll be relaxed and having a great time even without consuming any alcohol, which my friends and I didn't.  They have a buy-one-get-one-half-price on all of their sheesha, so for two hookahs, a salad, 1.5 litres of Moroccan mint tea, and a milkshake, we spent about $48.00 for three people that's $16.00 a person, pretty affordable night. I imagine things would get more expensive if you got alcohol, or would be kind of the same if you omitted food.   I will say though, this isn't a real kind of party place. Sure you can chill, drink, smoke, whatever... but the place is FILLED with leather chairs, they play a mix of current music and 50's-60's Motown pop. There are Backgammon boards at every table, and they let you stay as long as you want without bothering you. This is a place to go if you want to socialize, relax and have a conversation with friends, not to go, party and get slammed.   Ignore the negative reviews. The vibes that come off this place are decent. Now, I'm white... and when it comes to how \"traditional\" they are, I'm not really sure. My Islamic friend (who's been smoking Sheesha for years) says she wasn't a huge fan of the blends, however she's more than willing to go back until she finds something she likes because the place has a \"good vibe\". We cheaped out and got the regular sheesha, when we probably should have got the more expensive one. The owner told us to try the Grape Mint next time, which might sound like a strange combo, but he swears by it. He says the VIP sheesha is waaaay better than just the regular sheesha, though you only pay a couple dollars more. He imports most of it from Chicago.   Please try this place!! If you want something a little more unique in a night out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Petite perle située juste en face du métro Ossington. Ici vous pourrez vous affaler dans des canapés moelleux tout en fumant une bonne sheesha. Le bon deal ici c'est que pour 2 sheeshas commandées la 2e est à moitié prix. Je vous conseille d'accompagner tout ça avec une carafe de thé. L'ambiance peut varier selon les soirs, du lounge au hip hop RNB. Des orchestres live jouent aussi le week end.  Possibilité de réserver une salle VIP à l'arrière avec ambiance campement dans le désert avec des tentes installées à l'intérieur du bar.  Little gem located just in front of the Ossington Station. Here you can relax in fluffy couches while smoking your sheesha. The good deal here is to get 2 sheeshas and the second one will be half price. My advice : order a jug of tea with that. The atmosphere can change from one night to another from lounge to hip hop RNB. Some live band on the week end too. You can book tables at the VIP section at the back with a \"night in the desert\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super cool and laid back hookah...excuse me eliquid lounge. The guys told me after July 1 2016 no more traditional shisha. So we tried the E-liquid hookah. It wasnt the same for me. The drinks were 2 bucks which you cant beat. The place was empty we smoked and drank a little then we left. The interior is pretty big not sure why it was so empty though? The prices were cool as well not to much, so it wont hurt your pockets."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends on a Monday night before a comedy show. Really nice setup. The couches are pretty comfy.  We ordered the special, which came with a second order at half price, which they allowed us to use when we came back after the comedy show.  It was very quiet on Monday night but it's still a chill place to hang out."}
{"text":"I originally would have given this establishment 5 stars, but now it's 3 due to my most recent experience.  I chose this establishment for my birthday since I had been there before and generally had an overall 4 to 5 star experience. The first time I went there, I was with a friend and was given complimentary food to try. The service was extremely efficient then and the wait for food wasn't long at all. I had such a wonderful time, I knew I would want to come back!  The second time I brought another friend, the service wasn't as friendly as my first experience. We still had a decent enough time and mustered it up to the staff just having a \"bad day\".  I reserved one of the booths in their back section for the birthday celebration for a friend of mine and for myself. When I called to make the reservation, I was told that someone would call me back closer to the date to confirm food, drinks etc.   I never received a voicemail to confirm anything prior to my event. On the evening of my reservation, I received a very rude call from the establishment which started off with \"We have been trying to call you to confirm, but you haven't called us back\". No \"How are you?\" or any other polite salutations. I was very put off by the attitude of the gentleman on the phone.  There was not one voicemail left on my phone from their venue prior to my reservation. I am the type of person to not answer phone calls from unknown numbers. If it's important, someone will leave a message.  When we arrived, we were escorted to our area by one of the staff. We were told to put all our bills together to receive their promotions and that it would be much cheaper to do so.   The experience itself was fine. Service was timely (although the food was an awful long wait). The sheesha tasted fine - all 16 of my guests seemed to be having a good time. We did have a space issue since the staff gave away some of our reserved section to other guests as they needed the space, but we managed to pull out chairs for ourselves and sit on the arms of the couches etc.  Generally speaking, myself and my guests had a wonderful time, but my dismay comes to the bill.  That evening, I asked one of the staff what my total was, and they provided me a number. No print-out, just a number. Since I wanted to pay for the entire party, I went to the front and provided them with my debit card. The machine prompted for a tip, which I decided to give in cash (in my opinion, the tip I gave was very generous).  When I asked for a printout of the bill, the staff member seemed very hesitant to give it to me. I had to insist on the printout multiple times before it was given to me.  Since I paid for everything right before they closed, I took the printout and decided I would look at it the next day.  The next day, boy was I surprised. The pricing was completely all over the place. They charged for water anywhere between $0.36 to $1.50. I was under the impression that all their water was $0.36 since every other visit I had prior, it was charged at this price.  Additionally, the tip was already included on the bill (I was never informed of this protocol when I made my reservation, when I had everyone put their bills together, or when I was paying). This ended up in me giving me the establishment an $120 gratuity for the evening.  I'm not saying I \"regret\" giving them $120 for the evening. Of course their staff deserve it as I am aware they work very hard. Although, the service during my event was definitely lacking. I would have appreciated some more transparency regarding this.  It's a lesson learned for me to check the bill before I pay it. I just feel that this was an extremely dishonest way for me to end my experience with this venue. They could have let me know beforehand that the gratuity was included (many establishments inform their patrons of this, especially for large group bookings). The inconsistency in terms of the pricing on the bill was a big turn off. If water is $1.50, then it's $1.50. If it's $0.36, then it's $0.36. It cannot be both.  Additionally, my very first experience here as I mentioned earlier was amazing! I felt like they appreciated my business.  This time around, not at all.   Their sheesha is good, food is delicious, and the staff are friendly.  To me, the dishonesty I feel that I experienced with them will be the assurance that I won't return.  Tip: For large bills, make sure to keep track of what you order and check your bill very carefully before paying."}
{"text":"Literally the worst quality shisha I have ever experienced. The coals kept cracking in half, which is a sign that they are old. The hookah would barely pull any smoke and though we sent it back, the servers didn't do anything to help us. Avoid at at costs and either go to one of Toronto's many other shisha bars or buy your own (the cost of about 2 visits here) and smoke it yourself."}
{"text":"Love the decor of the place!! However the location is really loud... You can't hear each other...   Food was great and the hookah experience was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed at all. I've definitely been to much better sheesha places.   At first I really liked the area and atmosphere and their desserts looked delicious. The food was very tasty however, my friend asked to have a salad, which was not on the menu but the waiter was kind enough to go out of his way to make it specially for my friend. When we got the bill, it turned out that the \"special salad\" cost $14. $14 for JUST salad, really?  We ordered the SLM sheesha and a VIP. We were expecting some pretty good sheesha since the SLM cost $24. But with all the extra stuff they put into it, it really tasted no different from the regular VIP sheesha. So overall, it was a waste of money.   This place is very expensive for things that are not at all impressive. I felt like I did not get my money's worth of experience. Also, they do not accept debit or credit. Cash only. How is this establishment running a business that does not have a debit/credit machine? Get with the times buddy.  If you want a nice authentic sheesha lounge atmosphere. This isn't your place."}
{"text":"It wasn't very good. I really liked the atmosphere and the decore. But that was about it. If you get a booth they usually seat you with a bunch of random people if your group isn't big enough to fill the entire booth.  I don't smoke so I couldn't comment on the quality of the shisha but I CAN comment on everything else from food to drinks. I ordered a mixed drink but couldn't really taste any alcohol in it. The food was good but rather expensive. The drinks are ridiculously expensive.   Also be ware what it is that you're ordering and how much it costs. A pot of Morocco tea is usually around 10 bucks and can be enough for about 4 people. Don't order it if you don't wanna pay the price of a pack of tea for just 4 people. The manager was also somewhat rude and seemed to be trying to take advantage of us. Twice he brought out the wrong drink we had ordered and tried to convince us that we should just take it"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night for dessert and had a fantastic time. Arrived to find a very busy lounge area, but were seated and served very quickly. Servers were also friendly and helpful.   Were a bit worried when a musician started setting up right next to us, but the volume was fine and it turned out to really add to the atmosphere. I live close by and definitely intend on going back."}
{"text":"A great place to just go and hang out with friends.  I went with a friend and we had sheesha and a few coffee drinks.  Service was a bit slow, but we weren't in a rush, so it didn't matter to us.  They were pretty busy as it was a Sunday night before a holiday.  We didn't eat so I can't comment on the food, but the drinks were good and so was the sheesha.  I've never had the herb sheesha but as I discovered it seems that's all they have in Toronto.  A little harsher on the throat than tobacco, but still good.  We had the watermelon and it was great, and it tasted a lot like real watermelons.  We didn't get a second one, but I did like that they offered your second half off, seems like a good deal if you're going with a few friends."}
{"text":"The Sheesha Lounge is not the most polished place, but it is a fun destination with some tasty Sheesha and desserts.   It is a good place to go to lounge around, catch up with friends, drink beautiful tea, and based on our last visit, listen to fun 90's music you haven't heard in forever.   We went all out our first time for the Super ViP sheesha with the pound of fresh strawberries in the hookah. I am not quite sure this was exactly worth it. We have trip simple VIP sheesha since and all of it is good.   One of my highlights though does not concern the sheesha. I happen to love the cheesecake at the American chain, The Cheesecake Factory, and the Sheesha Lounge is one of the only places you can get this type of cheesecake in Toronto. Not only can you get this type of cheesecake, but they have a milkshake on the menu where they will blend a whole piece of this cheesecake into your drink! How wild is that? I have yet to try it, but I certainly will one of these times."}
{"text":"This was just my second foray into the world of sheesha and it was much better than my first.  The place is very lounge-y.  It's dimly lit for the most part.  Lots of couches and big throne-like chairs.  The couch that we were initially put on was made of leather, maybe fake leather, and was not incredibly comfortable.  When a space opened up by the window with chairs they let us move over there with no problem.  I thought everyone there was extremely nice, though they were very inattentive to the customers (at one point 3/4 of the people working there were outside taking a break).  We were also told they didn't accept credit cards, only to see several people using their cards after we had paid.  We also got to see a belly dancer show, that was entertaining.  The music was unnecessarily loud for the space and the number of people there.  I can't speak much to the cost of the sheesha because I've only done it one other time but I do remember that feeling very harsh in my throat and lungs.  This was much cleaner and smoother tasting.  They gave us extra coals without us having to ask so the sheesha lasted quite awhile.  We were also given mouth guards right off the bat.  Stay away from the mixed drinks!!!  They gave my girlfriend a shot of alcohol in a huge glass of orange juice.  Even after buying a second shot to put in it (which I'm not sure they did because they took the drink to the back instead of bringing the shot out) it still just tasted like orange juice.  The mixed drinks were also very overpriced."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times in the past as it was the nicest shisha place around. On this occasion, I intended to go to Nazareth, but it was super busy and way too cold to wait outside, so we ended up here.   It changed quite a bit since the last time I was there. The menu was more expensive and they had interesting add-ons to increase the price of the shisha.  Two excellent examples, $30 for a pitcher of Budweiser and $5 to add milk to the hookah.  The food was not good; luckily I did not get any because I was still hoping to go to Nazareth after. Everyone felt like they received some sort of frozen or Uncle Ben's meal. They charged 3.25 for a glass of ice with some gingerale sprayed on it.   The shisha was simply okay considering how much we paid for it.  I will not be returning. I would have been better off waiting outside."}
{"text":"This is my first review and I had to write it after having the most horrific experience at this place.  I have been there 2 times before, and it was an okay experience, nothing spectacular, it is usually pretty empty in there.  This time though, the owner is so completely rude and disrespectful to everyone in the restaurant, including his waiting staff but also to his customers.  He was so disrespectful and got very mad at us when one of us dropped a piece of coal on the ground.  He started yelling very loudly and  belligerently, and some of the people in our table were actually frightened. He then ordered his server to remove our sheesha--this guy needs some serious anger management."}
{"text":"We called in advance to ask if the shisha was herbal or tobacco. The woman on the phone stated that it was a mix between tobacco and herbal. We told her we were coming from far and asked for the pricd. She siad it was 10 dollars. We arrived and were pleased with the decor and atmosphere. We soon learned that there was only one waitress and her service was very slow. She also informed is that we needed to buy two shishas on order to get the 10 dollar price. She should have told us this in advance since we were coming from far. We ordered one strawberry mint and one mint. The flavour was horrible! It was definitely not tobacco so we felt very misled. Its ok its not tobacco but please tell us that in advance. The flavour burned away in less than ten mi utes which was very dissappointing. We definitely would never come back."}
{"text":"Should've listened to the reviews about poor customer service. Have not encountered worst customer service since eating in the seediest restaurant in Beijing. Their philosophy of customer comes last really shines.  Though the service was bad, the shisha was average. Hence the 2 stars. Avoid if there are other options."}
{"text":"Great place for Shiesha downtown.  Great atmosphere, very friendly staff, comfortable seating, nice music, great menu selection (food, drinks, deserts, coffees and of course shish).  A 1 minute walk from Ossington station.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"ok for what it's worth I'm not a local and I am shisha deprived. I'm from the SF bay area and they banned the serving of food/alcohol with sheesha, so excuse me if I am biased. Atmosphere-wise this place is pretty awesome. Lots of space and comfy couches. It's more of a cafe than a sheesha place I realized but there is nothing wrong with that. The menu is sort of ridiculous, like you can get a burger, a coffee, a platter of shrimp or spring rolls. Like let's put it this way, it has an appetizer section and for a sheesha place I just found this funny. Serves Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes too.  Service is a little meh but the price I thought was right for it. First fill was roughly 15-20 bucks and then 8 bucks for any refill.  This was great. They have some shisha infused with alcohol which isn't my thing, but it was cool they offered it. I think next time I will not have food, but I would definitely like to come again."}
{"text":"This place is alright and the service is pretty solid.  The special is that your 2nd hookah is 50% off which is damned nice if you are going for multiple pipes.  Or if your partner doesn't feel like sharing.  However, the coffee and cake?  Meh.  And the 'VIP' flavours - some jazzed-up flavours using some special pipe and distilled water... sounds fancy... but I don't like it when someone is trying to sell me on a $25 hookah.  You for realz?"}
{"text":"Its a perfect place to hangout with friends. I visited a hookah place after a very long time and let me tell you that I just loved it! Sheesha lounge made my weekend just \"wow\" from perfect. You will always find this place over crowded. Interior is a bit congested but then who cares when it comes to hangout with good friends.  Price- Reasonable  Food- Good  Ambience- Nice  Service- Good  I am not a hookah fan but I will visit this place in future again!!!"}
{"text":"The service is the only thing that really brings this places ratings down. It's rather abysmal.  My party of 3 walked in around 6:45-7pm on a Saturday to a near empty lounge and no one to greet us or show us to a seat for more than 5 minutes. After seating ourselves, one of my friends went to find someone who worked in the place.  She returned from the back with a less than eager waitress/hostess who handed us menus and went away for awhile, and for the sake of not over lamenting the fact that service is slow and crappy, I'll just say this was the trend all evening.  On the plus side, the hookahs are nice and pull well. We got one of the \"VIP Selections\" flavors SLM (I believe it was). It was among the best hookahs I've personally ever tried, complete with fresh fruit infused spring water in the base.   Aside from the hookah, we ordered food as we were all hungry. Good sandwiches, great fries, and tasty poutine.  The ambience was pretty chill, spacious enough, we got a quiet corner in the \"storefront windows.\"  For my fellow Americans whom also don't like to pay high international roaming bills, there is no free wifi, so save your IG and Yelp photos for later.  Overall, nice place place, the wait staff is just notoriously (thinking of a good word...) bad."}
