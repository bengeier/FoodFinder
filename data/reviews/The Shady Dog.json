{"text":"This is the best place to grab lunch in Shadyside in my opinion. Delicious. Cooked so fresh. Packaged up perfectly. $5 gets you a whole meal! Owners is so nice to talk to. Support him and keep this in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The food is great.  The first time I stopped by, I asked if he accepted cards.  I was disappointed that he didn't but he wouldn't let me leave without trying the food, even if all I had was a debit card.  The multiple times I've been back, I've had a good meal every time.  He is also great to talk to.  Very open and fun guy.    I will be back and would recommend the food in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday for a quick bite and I'm glad I did. The price was right and my sausage was even better..... His chilli is"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the cart. They were recommended by a coworker.  Absolutely loved it.  The lunch special was reasonably priced & the guys are entertaining while you wait.  The line can get a bit long, worth the wait!"}
{"text":"If you're ever walking the Shadyside/Bloomfield line with only $5 in your pocket and a rumble in your stomach, definitely check out the Shady Dog. While some may argue, \"It's just a hot dog\" I would assert that not all hot dogs are created equal. The Shady Dog uses Nathan's for their $3 signature \"Shady Dog,\" which is juicy to the core. Another good sign, is that the Shady Dog leaves you with very little guilt. It tastes good and doesn't make you feel like you've just eaten....well, you know. The owner (the one with the hair) is down to earth and fun to talk to. Definitely recommend, but just like the guy with the hair told me \"You can't eat this stuff everyday.\""}
{"text":"It's a perfect lunch experience. Grab a dog or two from John and sit down in the park to enjoy. He's out there Monday through Friday; although understandably not in winter. If there are any changes he'll post an update on his facebook page.   What makes his food cart the best?  1) The hot dogs themselves are great. Crispy on the outside, juicy and flavorful on the inside. 2) He toasts the bun too 3) You can order it \"John's way\" at no extra charge, which is where he'll spiral cut the dog and put a special sauce on it while it's grilling 4) He makes his own special premium relish 5) He has all the toppings you could want: onions, ketchup, brown or yellow mustard, grilled peppers...most are free of charge, some cost extra 6) Prices are reasonable, starting at $2/dog, I believe 7) He has a frequent-eater program - buy 5 dogs and get 1 free! 8) John is the nicest guy  Finding The Shady Dog made me so happy when I discovered John last summer. So happy he's back!"}
{"text":"I work in the city, and sometimes it's hard to find good food on the go! I get the vegan dog with fresh jalape√±os from his garden!!!! John is the best!!! He is a fun and an interesting person to talk with! Go get your self a hotdog, or hot sausage you won't be disappointed!!! And tell him Laurie from Peoples Gas sent ya! ;)"}
{"text":"If you ever get a chance try this hot dog stand. Good prices and you can even get a rewards card. Does take orders in advance and has a Facebook page to let you know when they are out and about! You will have a laugh. Great if you want to walk around shady side and eat. Perfect for a nice spring summer or fall day!"}
{"text":"Best vegan hotdog will be here everyday! He has so many toppings to choose from and caters to everyone. He even gave my golden a free hotdog!"}
{"text":"If you want a quickie, this is the place.  Good Hot Dogs along with Jumbo Kielbasa, Hot Sausage, and Vegan Hot Dogs.  Usually, when I see them,  at the little island in front of First United Methodist Church across from the Courtyard Marriott."}
