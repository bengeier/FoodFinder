{"text":"This place is under new management and doing a great job! Food is great, hamburgers are so yummy and they have a ton of new craft beers!! Will definitely be coming to this cool spot again"}
{"text":"The staff try really hard to make this place good like it used to be but unfortunately the food is so sub-par and so much more expensive than what used to be the pig bar that I have stopped going there.   The good: nice bar are, decent specials during hockey games 3 dollar yuenglings.  The bad: everything else.   I have tried a few things off their menu and you would think that if you are paying for a $12 burger in Pittsburgh it's going to be good. Dead wrong the burger was nothing special, over done a few condiments, cheese, and an ordinary bun, with about 12 French fries as a side.   The next time I wanted something else but they said they were out of a lot of things. It's not the waitstaffs fault whoever is managing this place has no idea what they are doing.   If you are going to charge a lot for your food make sure its worth it.  Overall would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"We have gone to Spring Garden twice in the last month, We were treated rudely both times when, we had informed staff that they had forgotten parts of our order, The Staff at Spring Garden Inn are slow, and lack basic restaurant skills, they are inexperienced, and and pay no attention to detail."}
