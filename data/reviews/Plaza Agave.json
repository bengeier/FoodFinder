{"text":"I've driven by this place for 2 years. Today was the day I figured I would give Agave a shot. Unfortunately it was not very good. Watery Queso, bland tacos, a hot plate and cold enchiladas. Slow service. Even the bill took 10 minutes. My advice is pass. Just keep driving. Taco Bell is better and faster for half the price."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, and great service!  We frequent Plaza Agave because it's the most authentic Mexican food I've tried.  Very nice menu, and love that they make fresh guacamole right at your table when you order it.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"i just had the worst meal i've ever  had, in my 60 years of dining out. I have come to this place frequently and always had great mexican food but last night i couldnt even finish one of the fish tacos.

they forgot to put on the sauce so it was dry. everyting from the beans to the rice to the fish were WAY over salted. the margaritas tasted like water even tho happy hour was over.

the staff pretends they dont understand you when you try to complain. they said they would give me my meal for free: which is what the coupon we had was anyway. and they still charged us for the awful drinks and the overly salted sides.
its too much work to complain so we just paid and left.

This used to be the best mexcian food in town; now with all the new competition opening in the area, they need to stay on top of things.

I see it closing in the near future....cant imagine anyone returning to this place.
Very sad....."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in town. Great service--and there's something to be said for great service."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, swift service, suitably strong margaritas, reasonable prices, attentive waitstaff that seems glad you came, cheesy Mariachi band at times --- this is everything you want in a neighborhood Mexican place.

Now if they'd only repave the parking lot and rid it of ankle-breaking holes; light up the too-dark bar; and put some greenery in the outdoor patio, as it's like sitting at the edge of the parking lot.

Then, everything would be perfecto!

But still, this is our go-to neighborhood place, and shall remain so.  At least they don't charge for chips and salsa like SOME Mexican places (Lee Road, Cleveland Heights)!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the area! It is affordable and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Monday night....not crowded... Service and food were great.   Fajitas were amazing today.  Sometimes they are better than usual and today was that day."}
{"text":"My mother and uncle had experienced food poisoning after eating here. Years later my friend asks me to go to dinner here and I got food poisoning the next day. The food was delicious, great quality, great service..just hate getting sick. Something was wrong."}
{"text":"Exterior/Location: A Mexican restaurant in Bainbridge, Ohio. Exterior is slightly run down and so it the parking lot. 

Interior: Brightly colored decor. Typical of many Mexican restaurants. Not super high end. 

Vibe/Ambiance: Super casual.  You can show up wearing almost anything. 

Staff: Most of them are of Mexican Hispanic decent. All were friendly and seem super excited that we chose to dine there. 

Clientele: Mostly regular barflies, regular locals and families 

Price: Moderate. Affordable 

Must get items: The table side guacamole!

Why I love or hate it: I like this place. It's been around for a few years in this area. The position are large and you will never leave hungry. They have a patio and a nice happy hour with great prices. I need to do that more often!

Final thoughts:"}
{"text":"We went here a few nights ago.  My first time.  Possibly a lot of family members working there.  The hostess appeared not too excited.  But she promptly took us to the table.  The waitress came right away and brought drinks.  My son ordered a special drink, they custom made, with no fuss.  While my husband thought the food was GREAT... I thought the buritto could have had something else inside it other than chicken... A sauce, cheese, anything.  Really too bland for Mexican.  It might have just been what I ordered.  They do bring you chips and dip while you are waiting for your food.  The food arrives promptly, presentation is ok,  and nice Mexican music playing.  I think the pricing is normal for eating out..."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and have a very hard time finding a decent meal at a restaurant. Plaza Agave is wonderful for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Skip this place if you like anything approximating authentic/good Mexican food.


My wife and I ate here, sitting outside on a warm early Oct. evening, and both had a meal, neither of which was good. We split the fundido which wasn't bad or rather, ... was ok. We also had the table-side guac. I hate when places make the guac. table-side. It was ok as well, though expensive. Our meals were not as good. My wife had the chicken ench. and I had a mixed plate w/ a taco, poblano and I think a mini burrito. All the items, excluding rice and beans, seemed to taste the same and that was pretty bland. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. We won't be returning. Bummer."}
{"text":"The experience and food here is pretty much what you'd expect from a local Mexican restraint, but something about it makes it worth coming back to. Table side guacamole is a definite plus, and I must say I am a sucker for their fajitas. Not really extraordinary, but they never fail to satisfy.  I come here quite often, and for some reason have enjoyed myself every time. Stick with classic Mexican dishes to be on the safe side!"}
{"text":"I'd say Agave is my favorite Mexican restaurant on this side of town. Their menu has all the traditional Mexican dishes you'd expect along with traditional Margaritas and beers. The food is absolutely delicious. The dishes always come out quickly and served hot. The margaritas are very tasty (I recommend the strawberry!). 

Don't forget to order table-side guac. Although the menu/food is a bit pricey it's fresh, delicious and fills you up!"}
{"text":"Dined there last evening and the food was perfect. We did wait a while for our main entree but we both were pleasantly surprised. Over the past few months I'd been to the restaurant  and was disappointed. The beans were thinned down, the rice was good but the portions had been greatly reduced from the previous months. The enchiladas they had been using for their dishes were always of a nice size, but there for a while they had been using much smaller  ones. I'm pleased to see that that went back to the original portions. The previous few visits had also yielded somewhat dried out and burnt food. I had thought that perhaps they had new kitchen staff. Last night however, they delivered a fatastic meal which was attractive, delicious, and moderately priced. My only complaint was that the entree's took a while to be served, but was definately worth the wait. They are soon opening two new Mexican Restaurant's in the area, so I hope they continue the great food, great value!"}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic food. Great margs and a super friendly staff. I love the veggie options here. The table side guacamole is worth the trip on its own. 

The patio is great too."}
{"text":"So happy to have a great local mexican place with a fresh menu and consistently good food.  Last night we had carnitas - were plentiful, cooked just right.  The service was great and it left me committed to finally giving them a really good review."}
{"text":"THE WORST. The first year of visits to this place was great. It really made me love Mexican food more than ever before. Unfortunately, as things went on the shittier the experience got. I could forgive the other downfalls over this past year as I chalked them up to a busy night or just bad luck on my end. The green onion root ends... Overcooked and burnt tortillas... Order mix-ups... But this last visit really just sealed the deal on the fact that I WILL NEVER DINE HERE AGAIN.

To preface this story: They implemented a new rule where every table only gets two baskets of tortilla chips. Any basket after that is an extra $3.25 or something. Okay, I can deal with that since I bet people were just sitting and eating the complimentary chips and salsa. My friend and I continue to order our queso dip and table side guacamole as an afternoon pick-me-up. The trouble started immediately when I was brought a cup of water with hair in it. Gross. Soon afterwards, the table side guacamole was delivered. IT WAS BROWN and unmixed and poorly chopped. Seriously, there was just a long piece of tomato skin, bruised and oxidized avocado, and bunches of cilantro. What the fuck. I complained and got a new water and a new guacamole. Also pertinent to the story: the new guacamole was not table side and very small. Per usual, the queso dip was fine however a very small serving. Every time I go they give you less and less...

Fast forward to the bill. I already mentioned to the server the guac no longer should be charged as table side, and they did follow that. The bill should have been around $8 ($4 guac and $4 queso). However, they charged us for chips. OH NO YOU DIDN'T!! We only ate half of the first basket before it was whisked away and replaced with a second full basket. We followed your new policy, and were charged anyways. So, I complained and used their menu against them. The server (who was rude and pissy to me) said that since we didn't order pops or drinks that the chips cost money. I pointed out they can't charge me for what is so obviously complimentary, as the menu points out. He said the menu says this policy, I said WHERE. He couldn't point out this so called rule anywhere. I was starting to argue, and the server chose to diffuse the situation by rolling his eyes and giving me the bill I wanted. I ended up leaving a around a $1.50 tip, which now as I am writing this I am pissed and want back. 

Whatever. Point is... They have been struggling for awhile now. The quality worsens every visit. There are new policies in place. They will try and sneaky charge you for food that is suppose to be complimentary. The server will get salty with you the moment you complain."}
{"text":"You walk in and unless they're crazy busy you will generally get the complimentary chips and salsa right away.  It's a great place for families and it is run by a Mexican family so you can try out your Spanish like I do. HOLA!   I usually get the carnitas (pork).  See my picture.  There is a bar here also and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We really wanted to try this place. However upon entering, we stood at the hostess stand for more than 5 minutes, and no one came to greet or seat us. No servers were at tables. There were two tables sat. We checked the bar side, and people were seated at the bar, but there was no bar tender. We went back to the hostess stand. As guests were leaving, we joked \"Did you guys have a server?\" They laughed and yes there was a server. We returned to the bar. This time there was a bar tender. Who looked at us three times and never offered service. We eventually just left."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had anywhere in the state of Ohio.  Rosa and Ricardo are the owners and do a fantastic job with the food and service.  Hot fresh authentic Mexican food served on hot plates!  Chips and salsa are impossible to stop eating!  My favorite Chori Pollo entree and Camarones queso!!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place looks super sketchy from the outside. But inside it's is nice and cozy. The star though is the food! Excellent food for a great price! Everything was seasoned to perfection and we will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Lived near by but never stopped there until a friend said it was great. Turned out to be fantastic food very authentic and so much taste. The parking lot could use a make over but the restaurant, food was Great. Love that that don't make their food over spiced like other Mexican restaurants, and the servers were top notch!, this one was just perfect. Would go back anytime.."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last few weeks.  The wait staff is friendly. I really like the chips before the meal comes out and you don't pay for them. Reminds me of the old chi chis restaurant days. They have quick service and large portions.  Could it be more authentic Mexican as the last reviewer suggests, maybe. But it's good enough for me. My kid liked the kids menu and drinks. They are easy to work with if it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"I have had both good and bad meals here. However, I would still recommended this place. The guacamole they make at the table is bland. I do recommend going with the regular guacamole and giving the steak and chicken soft tacos a try."}
