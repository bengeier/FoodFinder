{"text":"Food is great, staff are friendly, but ever since they started accepting courier orders (UberEATS and Foodora) the service for walk-ins has really gone downhill. Now there are always long waits (while couriers crowd the entrance). 

Otherwise the food is still great."}
{"text":"I started my new job just around the corner from Village by the Grange and decided, after a month of being in the area, to finally check out the food court.

I hit Mean Bao after reading some great reviews, and they did not disappoint!

I ordered the special - sticky quinoa wrapped in a lotus leaf, stuffed with chicken, Chinese sausage and mushrooms and served with steamed veggies. 

While I waited for my meal, I ordered the pork & shrimp siu mai. Oh my goodness. I LOVE dim sum and I'm from Brampton, which means my only option (realistically) is the Mandarin. I am SO thrilled to have this option nearby whenever I have a dim sum craving. The shrimp was so plump and the pork was seasoned perfectly - I can't wait to try all their dim sum offerings!

Onto the quinoa lotus leaf! This is definitely a filling and delicious lunch for $7. The grains are perfectly cooked and flavoured with the protein (and boiled egg in the middle.) The veggies on the side are only on-point.

I can't wait to try the bao next time I come back!"}
{"text":"Best....Sumei... ever... I want to have it every day!

Shrimp dumpling? Not so much... Maybe once a year when I have no other option."}
{"text":"A good fusion of western and Asian tastes all wedged in between a flat Chinese steamed bun. Not mean bao in the traditional sense but an interesting modern take on the concept. As my friend would put it, comparable to an Asian taco put simply. Simple asian tastes accentuated by refreshing veggies. Quick and affordable on the go food."}
{"text":"A bao stand in a food court, amazing!
Not as good as Bhan Mi Boys, but damn tasty.

Try them all."}
{"text":"Good place in leslieville if you want a filling lunch that's Asian food. They have a variety of dumplings and baos. The baos range from 4-4.75$ per bao and the dumplings are around four dollars as well. Good service, food taste great. Will come back"}
{"text":"Not bad at all, slightly expensive considering the portion. Fun little place, I'm chinese myself, dim sum could be had at normal chinese restaurant, they weren't good at all 2/5, the baos, we ordered pork belly and jerk chicken, very flavourful, excellent taste, the stars shown here are given for baos as this is what they sell best."}
{"text":"These tasty little snacks are dirt cheap. You can get two for 6 and a half bucks. They are so tasty. I love the spongy bread things (bao) and the variety of fillings. I always get jerk chicken filling. These guys get 'fusion' right. Great spot for a quick and delicious snack on Queen and Bathurst."}
{"text":"I stopped in today for combo number 1: beef with 5 spice bao with 3 pork & shrimp sui Mai. My expectations of that food court are not lofty so imagine my surprise when my first bite of my bao was transformative. Truly amazingly tasty. The bun texture and taste were perfect and the filling was fresh, crisp and meaty. For under $4 I would happily eat one of those every day for the rest of my life. The Sui Mai was okay - where this place shines is with their namesake bao. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great value for the quality of tasty food you're getting. Had the chicken bao and the shrimp dumplings - was pleasantly surprised at the amount of sizeable shrimp stuffed in there. 

The filling of chicken bao was well seasoned. Loved the peanuts, cilantro, peppers in there as well. Looking forward to trying the quinoa-chicken dumplings next!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Foodora food delivery service and the dumplings arrived without any sauces. Without sauces they were bland. Disappointing that Foodora customer service did not even apologize for not picking up the sauces and refused to refund. Without sauces, dumplings are almost uneatable as soy sauce is a must. Due to this experience, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Always SO good, so fast, so inexpensive and the servers are so nice.
All the Baos are great, Enoki and Braised Beef are my faves."}
{"text":"Out of the few bao places I've tried, this one is probably my favourite in Toronto so far. Mainly because the actual bao itself is so fluffy and soft. Growing up wth a mom who made baos regularly and attempting to make them myself before, I know how hard it is to make a bao dough that is that light a fluffy, but still holds its shape for a lot of toppings. I also liked how simple there menu was. Since bao isn't too popular among everyone, the simple menu saves time and confusion when choosing what to get on your bao.  

I had the pork belly and pulled pork and they were both amazing- I would definitely get both again. I also tried the eggplant hot quinoa box to share with someone, but it was just ok. I would not get it at home because it is easily replicated at home. Also two baos was definitely enough for me, I would've been satisfied not ordering the quinoa."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Stumbled upon its existence because of Instagram. I can't wait to return. I wish they could ship me some to Buffalo!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I have not sampled their Bao (buns).
A seasoned dim sum eater, I went straight for the shrimp dumplings and siumai (pork dumplings). Both were with what can only be described as lackluster. The siumai had no discernable shrimp on top, and the shrimp dumpling wrap was extremely thin. Their sauces tasted bottled.. cheap soy sauce, and no hot sauce or mustard sauces were available. Calling themselves mean Bao and not offering cha Siu Bao (sweet pork buns) seems strange.
Overall, they use cheap ingredients, and it tasted as such. Will return to try curry chicken Bao, but will manage my expectations accordingly. If you crave authentic dimsum or northern Chinese cuisine, this will not sate your hunger."}

{"text":"Went there again on October 22nd, 2015. I ended up ordering a little earlier than my arrival time by ordering through Ritual app.

I ordered 1 pulled pork bao (spicy option), jerk chicken bao (spicy option), and siu mai. Although it was pretty late in the day (around 6 PM), they had some siu mai available. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't super fantastic as some people say. The funky taste was less than that of the shrimp dumplings, though.

Pulled pork did not have that nasty, slimy stuff this time and jerk chicken was also pretty tasty. Turns out the spicy sauce option just meant that they'll put Sriracha sauce in there for you, which can be convenient. For me, it felt like it interfered with the taste a little bit."}
{"text":"This place use to be the best. I would go at least two times a week but in the past few visits the quality had gone down. I ordered a few of the tofu baos and when they came there was only one piece of tofu inside each (about the size of a thumb nail), no mushrooms, a few carrots and two sad prices of cilantro. This was upsetting but I love them so much I went back a few days later hoping it was a fluke but the same thing sad empty baos. Please go back to the way things were."}
{"text":"Stopped by mid-afternoon for a snack and had the pork belly and pulled pork baos....both were very tasty!

Very small menu and venue."}
{"text":"a very yummy take out shop. pork bun, the tofu was excellent and the beef was good. strongly recommend as snack or order lots and have a lunch. mmm"}
{"text":"So glad Mean Bao opened up in our neighbourhood! It's a great place to grab a quick lunch that packs in a lot of flavour. We normally order their bao's and all of them have been great. I would say two is enough for one person! You can pick the level of spiciness, but we usually go with mild as I like to taste the flavours of braised meat itself. The staff is also helpful in opening the door when I drop by with my daughter in the stroller, although I do wish they had high chairs if we were to choose to have lunch there (especially being in a neighbourhood with a lot of families)."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The family operated restaurant lies in the back of the grange food court. The meals come out fast but don't be fooled, the veggies are steamed fresh dimsum style. A must try is the Pork Belly Bao, get two cause one isn't enough. A great little joint packed with flavour for the meaties and veggies! If you're visiting the AGO, this place is worth the stop."}
{"text":"I was happy to see this small restaurant open recently. Friendly service and yummy dim sum. The full menu looks interesting but we tried only dim sum (siu mai) for our first visit and it was very good. Piping hot, straight from the steamer. If you poke your head over the counter and look in the kitchen you will see that they make the dim sum to order using a steamer with the typical bamboo boxes. This is the real deal.

Mean Bao also has reasonable prices in any area where food can be very expense. One downside, if you could call it that, is that there is not much seating (4-6 seats?) so if this place gets popular you will unfortunately probably have to do takeout."}
{"text":"This place is ok.... Their tofu and enoki mushroom bao is my favorite and that's speaking volumes given I'm not a vegan... I wouldn't recommend anything else based on my experience. I've been here on several occasions and everything except that and the salad is kind of hit or miss, please stay away from the shrimp dim sum... it's extremely stale and has a weird taste. The staff is rude and they have a conditional pass health rating as of 6/26/2017 if that matters to you."}
{"text":"I tried to go. It said they were open on Yelp but they were working on a custom large order and didn't know when they would open. ? I can only guess the food is good ?

I recommend calling to make sure so you don't walk a kilometer for nothing."}
{"text":"Bao's are great! I'd go back for sure for them. Pork belly was just awesome. Beef brisket was also very good, well balanced. Chicken was great too, though the radish could have been spread out a little more so there's always a bite of it with the chicken (or I could just bite more carefully).

As for the Dim Sum, we had the shrimp dumplings...they felt kinda like wontons that were a little freezer burned. Sticky Quino was okay. Had a little too strong of \"ho yeep\" (the leaf wrap) taste and was missing the taste of chicken and maybe mushrooms that you might normally find. Dim Sum might need some extra work.

Otherwise, glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"The chicken bao was dry. The braised pork bao was mostly all fat and the dim sum tasted like it been under a sun lamp for most the day. Bahn mi boys is better imo."}
{"text":"Mean Bao is a small takeout restaurant tucked in the corner right by the Annex Building in Village by the Grange. Not only do they serve baos, but they also carry dim sum and hot quinoa boxes (which I have yet to try)

I usually go for the pork belly bao, which to me seems like the most popular option here, but I also like the braised beef and pulled pork bao. Upon ordering, they ask how spicy you want it - I always go with mild, due to the fact that I can't handle the heat LOL. The portions are small, and ordering 2-3 baos is recommended. There is a nice meat/veggie to bun ratio which is nice, and the taste is quite pleasant. Depending on how many you order, the wait time is reasonable, roughly a 3-5 minute wait. They also put your order in cute takeout boxes if you order 2 or more. My only complaint is that the the menu is a little pricey since one single bao costs roughly $4 plus tax.

I recommend to give this place a try and I will go back in the future for my bao fix."}
{"text":"It's not too bad, but all is a little bland. Banh Mi Boys is not too far from here and has much better Bao though."}
{"text":"Yeah this is a takeout place. They have some bar style seating but the place is so tight with no air flow it's stifling.  The food is great though. We had pork belly bao, jerk chicken bao, and shrimp and pork dumplings. The bao is pure comfort food, I especially liked the pork belly one. The dumplings were also great. I will definitely go back and order take out but it's really not for eating in."}
{"text":"Checked out Mean Bao after reading about them online.  Ordered the 5 spice beef Bao.  Beef was so tender and had lots of flavor! One bao came with alot of meat. The bun (bao) was soft and fluffy.  Surprisingly pretty filling. The guy who served me was friendly and nice. Apparently no msg in their Bao and dim sum. Will definitely come back !!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. After living in China for 4 years we learned to love Xiao Long Bao and have been missing good Dim Sum. Mean Bao is located in an old garage, has simple but functional decor and very cheerful staff.

We spent $24 and ended up with too much food. Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Do not go if you have a peanut allergy. They don't mention on the menu that they will cover your food in peanuts, which is pretty shitty of them considering I got takeout and on opening the box I find I can't even enjoy my lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I go often. Try the 
- veggie one it is actually really good
- curry one is great too
- shrimp dim sum yum yum"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken bao. Small joint amd fast and friendly service.  I honestly really liked it.  It was quite comforting and service was so quick.  Good amount of filling and priced right."}
{"text":"First time bão experience, and loved it! 
They are super friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We actually ate at a pop up offering five bao (pork belly, jerk chicken, tofu/mushroom, shredded beef and bok choy, other chicken) within a bar. At $4.50ish (Canadian) each, the buns were stuffed with well seasoned or sauced meat and crunchy contrast veggies, often topped with nuts. Some reminded me of banh mi but on a steamed bun. Two people shared five and still had a tiny bit of room for dessert. Overall one is a solid snack or 2 could be a small, fast meal."}
{"text":"Okay so this place is dope and fresh as hell. 

The first time I ate here it was because I was ravenous and nothing else was open. It is fucking AMAZING. Incredibly innovative, unique, thoughtful food that tastes fabulous. Amazing mix of textures and flavours, and unique dishes I've never seen done anywhere else. (Love the tofu sushi, holy shit.) The veg baos are fucking riduciulous w/ enoki mushroom and tofu. Bao is fluffy and melts in your mouth. RIDICUOLUS!! Cheap and amazing, like I can't even write how mind blowingly excellent this place is! 

Also amazing was the eggplant tapas dish... damn, girl. Damn. 

Drag your ass here! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Taiwanese snack.  Tried pork mean Bao, the pork is tender and soft, but flavour is light and not as flavour as what I normally had in Taiwan.  It'd better if they add more groundnuts, and average spicy is not hot at all.  Bao texture is also not quite right, it's alright but not as great as I thought.  It's fast food joint so they take and prepare the order quick.  As for the price, it's really not cheap considering how small each bao is, one probably gets better, cheaper options for snack meals in bakery stores Chinatown.  Haven't had chance to try their dim sum, maybe in the future when opportunity arises I'd give it a try."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, good if you're veggie/want something veg, and a perfect snack stop.

Not a spot where you can sit down in comfort, FYI. Miniature place. But you can drunkenly lean against the counter while you inhale your tofu+enoki mushroom bao.

If possible, I'd give this place a 3.5. It's decent, better than three stars, but I can't say I'm a devotee."}
{"text":"Best bao I've tried! The bao is nice warm and wonderfully soft, practically melts on your mouth. I got the vegetarian bao (enoki mushrooms and tofu), loved how everything tasted but there was a bit too much sauce which I think covered up the natural taste of the veggies. Next time I'll just ask for less.

The person who helped me was very nice and made me feel welcomed. 
Perfect place to get some good healthy food on the go, for cheap! They're cheaper than bahn mi boys and SO much better. Can't even compare.

I'm dying to try their hot quinoa boxes, those look delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice little place on Bathurst and Queen.
I love that the food here is fast,fresh and fuss free.
I tried their pork belly bao and pork and  shrimp dumplings and they were both realy good and super cheap. Most menu items are under $5
Service was casual but attentive.
I will b going back for sure."}
{"text":"I had two buns - pork belly and pulled pork. They were tasty, fresh, light and fast so I'm pretty happy. The price is a bit on the high side but for getting all of the above right, it's reasonable.

The location is a bit hard to find if you just go by google maps - it took me a minute to work out that it was deep inside a mall food court (maybe there is a more direct entrance)."}
{"text":"Tasty Bao and siu mai.

If you're looking for a new lunch spot or are craving for an Asian-fusion dining experience, this is the spot for you. 

Their bao sandwiches are fresh, well made, and delicious with just the right amount of marinade and seasoning. 

Mean Bao's siu mai is delicious as well but I must note that it is unusually large which I consider to be more of a plus than a downside as there is more to eat.

I have to mention that the Queen and Bathurst location is pretty small so you might want to consider take out."}
{"text":"We came here because the restaurants we wanted to try around the area were not open yet. The restaurant only had 4 seats since it is usually a take-out place. We got our order of jerk chicken and pork belly baos really quickly. The buns were really fluffy and soft but the meats were only ok. I would not come back for baos. My sister thought that the dumplings were ok - she liked that she could make her own dipping sauce with the table of sauces at the side. I can imagine that this place could get really crowded during peak lunch times, but we went at like 4:30pm and there were no lines at all. I do not think I would come back as there are a few other places around here that I have heard good reviews about and would like to try."}
{"text":"Got a braised beef and pulled pork Bao. Was a little lighter than I had expected and could definitely do with a bit more filler. That said, very flavourful, and the decor is pretty interesting. Would recommend if you're looking to sit with some friends and get out of the sun."}
{"text":"So good. Great baos & dim sum for a good price point. This location is way nicer than the Bathurst location- there's actual pleasant seating. It's not a place you really stay for long anyway, but a grab & go. I've tried all the baos and the pork belly is my favourite."}
{"text":"Tried their hot quinoa box with the BBQ chicken - a tasty and healthy option for lunch - and it's not that pricey!"}
{"text":"The vibe in here is so great! Great hip hop playing, the folks are friendly. It's a 416 snackbar type of vibe."}
{"text":"Great flavours. Awesome take out, that also holds up really well when delivered as well. Make sure you leave the place with a lot of sauces in your bag and/or ask for extra! If you're eating in, it's a bit cramped and stuffy in here. 

However, there do make a very Mean Bao. I personally like to order the enkoi mushroom bao and pork bely. The pork belly is perfect every time and the mushroom bao is like a bouquet of tiny mushrooms in your mouth. Yum."}
{"text":"Cold noodles are great here. I also love the shrimp dumplings; they're bigger than the typical dim sum serving size and the shrimp is so fresh! This place also has awesome vibes: casual, cozy, great for solo or small groups."}
{"text":"Great addition to the East End! Will be returning frequently for a tasty meal on the go :)"}
{"text":"That's some yummy bao!  Just had lunch here.  Ordered the pork belly bao and garlic chive and shrimp dumplings.  The dumplings were large with lots of shrimp.  The bao was soft and flavourful with the right amount of crunch from the veggies.  Looking forward to sampling the other bao flavours.  Decent price for lunch in this area and friendly service.  I would suggest going before or after the lunch rush though as I received my order I overheard them saying they ran out of bao!"}
{"text":"Finally somewhere decent to eat in Village by the Grange! Been here a few times for takeout - 2 baos will do you for a dinner. The pulled pork & the spicy chicken ones are amazing! The guys working there are super nice too."}
{"text":"First customer in at 11am. Greeted by cheerful hipster guys.  Ordered the pork belly and beef.  Perfect size for breakfast. Great flavours. And the soya ginger spicy relish at condiment stand. Amazing. !  Was getting busy when we left.  Gr8 value for the depth of yummy ness.  $9"}
{"text":"At $3.50 per fist-sized bao, it's quite a bit cheaper than the pork belly bao from that now-ubiquitous noodle place on University (hereonforth referred to as That Place).  How does it compare? 

First thing to note is that this isn't a fancy resto.  It's purely a take-out or sit in at the food court spot only.  

The pork belly bao cut just a teensy bit thinner than That Place, so to me it felt a little less...what many would refer to as \"sinful\" or \"decadent\".  I'd like that pork belly to be marbled in with lots of chubs, please.  It does, however, have more vegetable toppings though it's traded again by slightly less pork sauce.  There are small containers for condiments to be taken out by the plastic utensils counter, so you can always top it up with sriracha if you can handle the heat.

On that note, the jerk chicken bao was surprisingly devoid of spiciness.  Still pretty good though, slathered in that jerk chicken gravy. 

The baos themselves are relatively standard par.  While I have to admit that put head to head based on the bao alone, I do prefer That Places'.  It's the way better service, the variety of baos, the price point for a not too discernible difference in product, and the ability to app-order in advance (whereas That Place won't even accept phone orders - um, k then).  Oh, and by the way, if you use the app (Ritual) to order and pay in advance of your pickup, you'll receive 10% off!"}
{"text":"Their food was great! Would highly recommend!  However, not really meant for a sit down meal/snack. Takeout is a great option though"}
{"text":"I used to get the sticky quinoa box and it was amazing! Now they have new quinoa boxes and they are not good! The quinoa tasted watery and the chicken was overly spiced with black pepper , did not enjoy."}
{"text":"I love these sandwhiches. They taste so fresh. Staff was super friendly. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had read some good reviews on this joint so decided to check it out for a Sunday dinner.
Like others mentioned, the dining area is quite small and fills up fast but it is nice that it opens to the outdoors furthest away from the kitchen.
I ordered the vegetarian noodle small plate (tofu, wheat-based noodle, lots of fresh veggies) and topped it with some of their spicy sauce and pickled ginger. Ingredients were very fresh, but the \"spicy\" sauce was not spicy enough for me. I would have preferred a chili oil or the like. The pickled ginger condiment was the best part of this small dish!
For the main course, I ordered the chicken plate with quinoa and veggies. The quinoa and veggie were awesome! The chicken was intended for my dog as I am vegan but it had so much sauce all over it, it overwhelmed the entire dish and made it inedible for my little guy. Although, some may like the Super saucy chicken. Admittedly, I should have asked how the chicken was prepared.
The staff were not entirely friendly. The cashier was indifferent. The guy prepping the food seemed annoyed. When I asked him for assistance he simply ignored me and told another staff person to help me.
The food was good, the service not so much. I think the baos are what people come here for."}
{"text":"Heard lots about this place and figured it was time to check it out. First of all the dining room is tiny so take out is a good option. Staff were quick to take orders but seemed frustrated if not overwhelmed by meeting some big Uber Eats take out orders. The person making the food kind of just stared at all the orders and didn't seem to know what to do first. Food only took about 15 minutes and was okay but flavors were pretty flat. Maybe they need to work out the kinks... I'm open to giving them some time and trying again."}
{"text":"We were just strolling around the area when we stumbled into this little gem tucked away in a corner. We got the jerk chicken mean bao and the pork belly mean bao. I really enjoyed the flavours and it's a good snack in between meals. Around $3-4 a bao so not too expensive but don't expect to walk out full. Will definitely return for some more baos!"}
{"text":"I order delivery from Mean Bao all the time.  I love their bao sandwiches!  The bao bun is always wonderful and soft, and the fillings are always tasty.  My favorites are the pork belly, pulled pork and braised beef. Delicious!"}
{"text":"If you like momo's pork buns, this is a good alternative. I had the pork belly bao, but wasn't too impressed. good choice for a quick bite if you are passing by.

Also they use peanuts without having it listed on the menu - be careful if you are allergic"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS. I had never had a bao sandwich before, and after this, I am definitely a fan. So good, I went back twice in one week! You can't go wrong with any of the choices, I'm pretty sure I tried almost all of them :) Two or three were good for me for lunch, depending on how hungry you are! They do get busy at lunch, but their staff are friendly and they work quickly. Eat here, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Eh, it's alright I guess, but there's pretty tough competition around here. Not the best bao in the area."}
{"text":"Tiny snack shop in south corner of Queen and Bathurst.  Pork Belly Bao was amazing, I also got the Brasied Beef Bao which was decent too.  Not much to dislike here. Just that it can be busy and it takes forever to get your order."}
{"text":"The concept of snacking on dim sum food, well just sign me up!
I don't have to commit to a sit down meal in a restaurant to satisfy my dumpling craving? Oh yes please. (Opens at 11am)
I really like the braised beef bao with that rich deep simmered beef flavour and the tender meat, oh so good.
And the dumplings are great too! I like the pork and shrimp ones, and along with their house made hot oil sauce, it's standard dim sum I realize but whipping in and out of this tiny spot makes it extra special.
There are a couple of vegan dishes too and the rice bowls look really good and more of a meal for around $8.50.
With Starbucks on the corner and super dive of a Pizza Pizza across the street, Mean Bao is the obvious choice when it comes to a quick and light snack to keep you going. 
Don't go expecting something fantastic, but after every time I go the energy both literally and metaphorically I feel from eating this fabulous street food just can't be beat."}
{"text":"It's a Chinese bum and dim sum place locating in Ocad's food court. Just opened this summer. Just wanted to give it a try for my lunch with no expectation. There wasn't too many choice on the menu. I ordered the pork belly, which was the best selling item according to the cashier. U can also choice from mild, medium, and spicy. i went for medium. when i finally tasted it, It surprised me! The bum was so soft! It got the best texture I have ever tried! The pork belly was juicy and soft. Felt like melting in my mouth. They had also put some veg in it. Green and red pepper, radish, and something I don't quite remember. The sauce they used was the Ho Sing sauce. A typical Chinese sauce. There were 3 other meat on the menu. I have tried the pulled pork and the beef. They were ok. The best one still goes for the pork belly. I would strongly recommend that to anyone!"}
{"text":"We had 2 types of baos. They were good, but not as good as Bahn Mi Boys' baos! Next time I'll try the dumplings"}
{"text":"Really friendly and honest service and the bao was delicious! I had the bbq chicken bao, and the mushroom + enoki bao ... my favourite of the two was the bbq chicken because the chicken seemed fresh and tender, and wasn't covered in that generic sweet bbq sauce that makes me sick --- it had a really savoury flavour that was complemented well by the other toppings. The buns were nice and warm and steamy.

The two came up to just over $7 with tax. Will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"The baos are surprisingly good - light, fluffy, and favourful. But the quinoa vegetable option is not worth it - bland steamed side that you drown in sauce for favour. The dim sum is okay but definitely not the best. I'd skip the sides and get all baos instead."}
{"text":"Never tried Bao before coming here, but after tasting it at this location, I can say I'm a fan lol. The bun is very soft and pairs well with the flavour of the pork belly and the crunchiness from the peanuts and cucumbers. Personally, I love coriander so it's always a plus in my dish. 2 are pretty filling in my opinion. Best to come during off-peak hours."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot. Cheap combos and good dim sum. A step under the boys, but a close second. The fact they have dim sum is a plus."}
{"text":"Hi, I'm Chinese.  I think I know dimsum.  This ain't it.  

I asked if they make their own shrimp dumpling and siu mai.  They said yes, so I figured, let's give it a try.  

The shrimp dumplings were totally over steamed and the wrappers were soggy.  The shrimp inside had very little flavour and nothing to bind them together.  The wrappers actually had the texture of wonton wrappers.  Bizarre.  

The siu mai looked impressive and authentic.  The taste?  It was like eating a springy meatball.  It just didn't have the right combination of pork, shrimp, and other ingredients to give it a real dim sum taste and texture.  

I've had their baos at the Grange location and they were okay.  I wanted to try their other menu items but I wish I stuck with the baos.  

2 stars because the guys behind the counter were nice."}
{"text":"So just tried this place today for my first time after finding it here in Yelp.  Ordered the one tofu and one pork belly for take out.   I have a feeling I'm gonna regret this decision...as the flavour combinations were amazing and I can see myself now craving these little gems.  I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Ok, before I start off this review I want to mention that I ordered take out and had my Mean Baos delivered, so they weren't piping hot and fresh as most would like them.  It all started when I saw that Mean Bao was an option on my Overtime food menu list.  Alas, a light at the end of my intensive work hours, where all I usually have to look forward to is what Freshii or Quiznos has to offer.  So I waited as I blazed through my workload, waiting for that email telling me my Mean Baos have arrived...

I've heard of the debate on this place being better or on par with Banh Mi Boys, so needless to say my mouth was watering in anticipation.  I also decided to take it up a notch and ordered the pork belly, chicken, braised beef and pulled pork baos.  What can I say, I was starving and my eyes are always bigger than my stomach.  

To be fair, I knew the food would be a bit cold, and delivery never tastes as good as fresh food, but wow was this place a huge disappointment.  To start things off I ordered \"mild\" or non spicy for all my baos (because who wants to go that hard in the paint during work right?) and they got 3 of the 4 right.  The braised beef bao was so full of chili peppers and spice that my eyes watered like I was listening to \"I wish\" by R Kelly.  The next issues came in my chicken bao, which was full of bones.  Yes there were shards of bone in my chicken bao, just like the meat from a freshly killed gazelle a lioness would feed to her cubs.  Ok fine, I'll try and look past those things, this place deserves at least a 3 star right?  Upon consuming my last bao, and possibly my favourite of the bunch, I was welcomed with more bones...where the heck are these little bone shards coming from, it's pork belly!!?

Anyways, to boil it down, I was massively disappointed.  Banh Mi Boys still reigns as champions of the bao in my books.  Not by a little either, definitely by a loooooooooong shot.  Looks like I'll be ordering that meatball sub at Quiznos on my next overtime meal..."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys is better.  This place is just so-so.  I had the pork belly bao.  BMB gives u a much larger portion of meat, more pickled veg, and the bun is also fluffier.  Here, I admit, I liked the peanuts in my bao.  That's about it.  

Sorry Mean Bao, it's the truth.  :("}
{"text":"Try the pork belly bao, it's amazing. The jerk bao was good too. Don't order the dim sum.... rip off and very subpar. In terms of prices, I saw people here saying it's a \"cheap meal\" but I disagree. Like most of these hipster Asian fusion restaurants, prices are a bit steep for the portions. The baos are a bit small. I'd definitely need at least 2 to feel full. As it stands now, each bao is $4.25 plus tax."}
{"text":"I ordered two pork belly baos and some shrimp dumplings. It was Uber-hot inside and I got rather sticky while waiting. They have a nice array of sauces available. Food was good. Don't know if I'd go again as it didn't stand out against anything else in the city that's like it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if Mean Bao is open late, but this would be a great spot to get an alternative quick after-bar eat.

Think of a mostly self-serve dim-sum-esque menu.  Prices are actually cheaper than going to some restaurants for dimsum in the city.  I tried the pork belly bao and pork+shrimp dumplings - both under $4.  Didn't jump out at me, but they were decent and fresh.  Their spin on sticky rice/quinoa looked intriguing.

Honestly, a great stop if you're feeling hungry but not for a full meal.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I tried this place out (after a couple failed attempts due to overcrowding) a few weeks ago, and have to say the food was great. My dining partner and I had the pork belly steamed bao, siu mai and pork and shrimp dumplings. Everything was hot, tasty, and spot-on in terms of texture. Great selection of drinks and fun toppings/sauces available as well. 

We wanted to try some different menu items so we stopped by yesterday at 2:30pm on a Saturday, to find it was absolutely packed with people. It was just too damn cold to wait outside, and to risk having to stand and eat if we couldn't snag one of the very few barstools wasn't worth it.  

Being a hole-in-the-wall establishment might not bode well for Mean Bao during the winter. I hope in warmer weather they place some tables and chairs outside - or just move to a larger place. Again, the food isn't to be missed, but you really take your chances with seating availability."}
{"text":"I came here while working in the neighborhood.

I got some pork steamed dumplings.  They were good.  They came piping hot.

I would,recommend this place.  Good eats.  Decor s reminiscent of an old,garage being repurposed.

Staff friendly and food,tasty. 

Open your wallet and then open your mouth.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place really hit the spot. The Hubster and I needed a snack before attending a wedding and went here on a whim. We both ordered the pork belly bao. It was the perfect mix of savoury, fatty pork belly, sweet hoisin sauce, crunchy and cook cucumbers and the soft, slightly sweet bun. It was just the right amount of food at a great price. Service was friendly and we got our order in couple of minutes."}
{"text":"Excellent bao. Adorable staff (why are there so many cute young men in this city?). Tiny shop. There's a countertop with stools to eat at, and a charming vibe. I need to try more of their menu, but the tofu bao I had was excellent. The coconut water was a bit sharp-tasting, but perhaps it's a normal undertaste that I'm just not familiar with? 

I hear it gets very busy at lunch, as in lines out the door. I was there at 12 pm and it was fine, but perhaps I beat the rush. It's been there nine months and already the staff have that happy \"we're doing well!\" vibe that is a pleasure to see."}
{"text":"This restaurant had a great cosy feel to it; it's quite small with only a few tables, but the food here really packs a punch! I had their pulled pork Bao, and it was amazing! The staff was nice, and allowed me to take several pictures of the restaurant. The food was made on the spot and the service was quick. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing addition to the neighbourhood! A modern take on Asian classics. Relaxing, clean, chill atmosphere. Spicy and flavourful bao and bowls served quickly. Very friendly service. Bao was presented nicely in cute bamboo steamer baskets!"}
{"text":"This place is really awesome! The pork belly bao here is  really delicious. They also have dimsums. You can go with two baos and one dimsum, which is around $12. The siu mai is huge and filling. I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Nice snack stop around street corner, inexpensive and yummy. Like the tofu pocket,good choice for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Tastiest Jerk Chicken Bao i've ever had! 

My girlfriend and i were just wandering around the downtown core and were getting quite hungry and decided to get a snack. Mean Bao was around the corner and we tried it out. We both love jerk chicken and got 2 of the Jerk Chicken Baos. The Bao was soft and fresh and with the succulent addition of the jerk chicken plus the coleslaw, you cant go wrong. Honestly the best Bao's i've ever had to date."}
{"text":"Aint no Banh Mi Boys, thats for sure.

While meandering around the Grange Food court, looking for cheap scraps of food on my lunch hour, I found Mean Bao. Cool signage, cool vibe. 

Anyways, I ended up with the smallest Bao I have seen in my life. At $4.00 each, you would expect the filling to be substantial. Nothing here. Bland taste, 3/4 of my bao was filled with peanuts. I had the pork belly bao. There was absolutely no value to be found here. 

Back to BMB!"}
{"text":"Good quality bao combos but not filling for $5 a piece. Could've got a whole Greek dish next door"}
{"text":"Have tried their baos and dim sum. Get the baos, stay away from the dim sum! The dim sum wasn't good.

The baos (at $3.95 each) are all quite good. The bao itself is super fluffy. I more recently had the chicken and braised beef baos, both of which were tasty. Meats were tender, and sauces and toppings made the baos nice and flavourful. I think I tried the pork belly bao at the grange location and wasn't that impressed with that one.

I've always been greeted with friendly service here. Also convenient location (right at Queen and Bathurst)."}
{"text":"As a kid who frequented Chinatown often, I have had my fair share of baos, but always with pork. One day, I heard of an urban legend about a serial killer who stuffed baos with human meat (ugh, cannibalism, amiright?). As a discerning child, I stopped eating them. Though I probably confused that story with the plot of a Chinese horror film, I grew up and became a vegetarian, so I haven't had a bao in over, perhaps, a decade. I see that they're somewhat in vogue as food trends go, so I thought why not try the trendy bao?

Long story short, sinking my teeth into the fluffy tofu/enoki bao was like taking a sweet bite of childhood. I only lament that it is rather costly for one bao, knowing that just down the street, I can get a straight up (regrettably meat-filled) bao for like a dollar. I'm pretty used to paying more for just about everything nowadays, so it is not a huge deal, but it just makes me a little sad when common street food becomes \"cool\" and then comes with a premium mark-up. Still, this is a nice treat for when I'm in the area and in need of a snack."}
{"text":"Pork belly bao is da bomb! After having had the bao at momofuku and even the best homemade version, I started dreaming of a fast food style restaurant that would allow me to stuff my face with as much bao as I wanted in an affordable and efficient manner. Mean bao is that dream. 

I feel so strongly about the superb quality of the bao that I awarded 5 stars despite the average dimsum, and tiny venue. 

It's worth a visit if you are in the area to grab some bao's (pork belly!) while you walk along queen street. It's cheap and so well made. Can't really go wrong with a mouthful of pork belly."}
{"text":"I came here at about 10:55 pm on a Friday and these guys were just about to close shop.  I was lucky they were open but also was understanding that this was definitely going to be a to go order considering the doors were essentially going to be locked behind me.

There's room for maybe 4 people to sit and maybe 5 people to stand in line in this tiny space.

I went with 2 pork belly baos that were boxed and bagged for me really fast.  I didn't get to eat them until I went home considering I was just being greedy because I had just eaten minutes before but wanted a late night snack after a late dinner.  

My wife was hungry so it worked out.  By the time I got home the baos were still very fresh and very good.  Not bad considering this was \"order and leave\" food.  The hoisin sauce is rich and tangy.  The buns surprisingly held up and didn't get overly soggy considering they weren't eaten for about an hour since I received them.

The pork is a nice thick healthy cut which is common with all pork belly baos I've ever had.  For under 5 bucks it's a perfect snack."}
{"text":"Was in the beaches area looking for a good snack. Other than pizza there wasn't much. I'd love to see places like this all over. These are the perfect snack. The steam buns are fluffy and sweet - but not so much so that it makes the savoury nature of the dish strange - the fillings flavourful and satisfying. I've been a couple of times. I've had the pork belly, the enoki and tofu and some other stuff I forget but it was all delicious. I know I also had dumplings. Again, not sure which ones but definitely good."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for awhile, its really close to my work and one day I decoded why not! I would like some mean bao! So I ventured to the grange and ordered the BBQ chicken mean bao. The wait was not long at all and the moment I took a bit out of it. It was heaven!!!!! Wow, the bread is sooooo fresh and so soft. The chicken was delicious! I wish I ordered two. I only got one for 3.50. Next time I know to order two!!! One was just not simply enough."}
{"text":"Stay away!!!! We came here for lunch after having a positive experience at their leslieville location. First of all, the place is a dive. It's tiny and dirty. Secondly, the food was inedible. The two guys behind the counter seemed frazzled and lost. They couldn't answer any questions about the food. They forgot to give us our complete order, but we asked for a refund on the forgotten items because what they had given us was so bad. 

Pork belly boa - flavour was ok but texture was horrible.

Braised beef boa - I took a bite and had to spit it out. Tough meat with a big hunk of fat. It tasted like it hadn't been cooked for long enough, and also had no seasoning. It tasted like boiled meat. Ew. 

Shrimp dumplings- had dried hard edges, and the shrimp inside was very fishy and had little crunchy bits. Tasted like it had been badly freezer burned. This I also had to spit out. 

Pork dumplings-same dried hard edges that seemed freezer burned, and the filling tasted like moth balls and pig crap. Really bad. 

Quinoa salad - this was the only thing that was remotely edible, and it tasted like mucky, sticky quinoa with hoisin dumped all over it. So still bad but we didn't have to spit it out. However we didn't take more than a bite each. 

A truly gross experience. They also had no napkins, no straws, and the entrance was blocked with a garbage can in our arrival. Stay away!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighbourhood and was walking by when I saw a sign that said \"Mean Bao\" on my way to shoppers. On a spur of the moment, I decided to take some take out. Decor inside was clean and pretty, I had my dog with me so I couldn't really dine in. Staff there was friendly and efficient. I ordered a pork belly bao, shrimp dumplings and sui mai. 

Pork belly bao was smaller than I expected it to be since Ive been to Banh Mi Boys a few times, but to me, it tasted better. Not the meat and ingredients in itself, but the bao. The bao was soft and a perfect ratio to the meat inside, unlike Banh Mi Boys bao where I find the bao to be too thick and heavy. I ask for no peanuts but there were still peanuts inside..Im not allergic or anything but just don't like the taste of them, but the crunch had a nice texture with the fatty pork belly and soft bao so if you are a peanut fan you would love this little bao. To me it could have used a bit more hoisin sauce but nonetheless a great little treat (its better to have less sauce and ask for more than for it to be drenched in it!)

The sui mai was a bit disappointing since I ate the bao first. I don't know what it was...It felt too tough? It looked right, but maybe its because I ordered take out so it didn't taste as good? I don't know...I have to try it again dining in to really rate it.

Shrimp dumplings were my favourite out of the three. It was just a simple shrimp dumpling that was not overcooked and just was so yummy! I ask for the sweet soya sauce on the side and had some hot sauce at home and it was like a perfect dim sum \"hai how\". So happy to have discovered this gem. 

Definitely will be back to try all the other items!!"}
{"text":"I love myself a good bao. I stopped by here for a quick lunch before heading out of Toronto. I had one of their lunch combos - one bao with any dumpling for ~9 dollars. I got their original pork belly bao with their shrimp dumplings, both of which were moist and tender to the bite. They also had extra sauces on the side - hoisin (which I happily doused my bao in), a house made sweet chili vinegar, and chili oil. My only complaint is that the portions are small for what you pay and I left there hungry."}
{"text":"Maybe I came at a bad time but they were not friendly at all and acted like I was interrupting them from doing more important things. I don't mind unpleasant service if the food is good but the pork in the pork bao was tough. With that said, the food did come very fast. To bad it wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Just okay. I ordered the pork belly bao, shrimp dumplings and su mai which all were okay. I was expecting more, especially from the bao considering the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome bao - the pork belly is by far the best. 

Dumplings, also delicious, and filling."}
{"text":"Good tasting baos. Lots of flavour. Favourites are pork belly, braised beef, and jerk."}
{"text":"So happy to have Mean Bao for a neighbour. 

All the Bao are good and no two taste the same. Just returned from a trip to NYC where we tried the famous Bao House. Happy to report, they don't hold a candle to our local Mean Bao bros!!

Everything here is delicious and you can tell they put a tonne of effort and heart into all of their items."}
{"text":"First time trying a Bao in 6ix, or Tdot. I got the Jerk chicken and Siu Mai pork+shrimp dumplings. $8.50+tx not bad for just trying it out! I could use swear words to describe how friggin good it was, but I won't. Handmade Bao, hot and fresh, handmade dumplings, you could taste it with every bite and the balance was there too, just enough salt and spice, I was actually full after that tiny meal, but when I get that hunger again this will be the only answer. Peace out!"}
{"text":"Fun little joint, no frills.  Food was cheap and excellent.  Came out quick, would return again and again!"}
{"text":"in the food purgatory that is the village by the grunge, mean bao is heaven sent. just had the pork and shrimp dim sum. mind blown and wishing for seconds."}
{"text":"I was a bit early for an event/party that would go until 2 in the morning, so I decided to check out the area and see what there was to eat. After killing 45 minutes in Starbucks, I walked by and saw Mean Bao.  I remember trying this place back in Chicago and it was pretty decent.

They have a few vegetarian options and I ordered the cold noodle salad.  It was around $6.75 (I think) and the portion was probably good for a small lunch or large snack (depending on how much you eat).  

The tofu and the veggies were fresh and the sauce was good too.  Food came out in less than 2 minutes and the service is very friendly. If I'm in the area, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm normally a sucker for hole in the wall places but this was literally a hole. In the wall. I had the pulled pork bao which was passable because of the soft steamed bun but the pork itself was dry as if it had gone through too many reheats. And there were flies buzzing around in this tiny little place. Not really my thing."}
{"text":"bbq pork bao never disappoints! The sticky quinoa was amazing the first time but was only ok the 2nd time.  This is a take out place - don't expect frills. There is barely any seating and extremely small. but all in all,  I would definitely recommend this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"Do not understand the hype for this place. Not worth the walk, struggled to find the place and found out 20 minutes later than was inside the food court of OCAD University.
Service was okay, the guy recommended the pork belly bao but it was flavourless and the beef dumplings with shrimp were horrible. Pulled pork bao was okay.
2 stars for service..."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap food! I got a tofu and enoki bao to go and it was warm and nicely wrapped. The bun itself was very soft and spongy and the tofu had nice flavour. The sauce didn't taste like much, but maybe it was because I got the non-spicy version.

My only crit is that the ingredients were dispersed evenly. I got all the sauce on one side and nothing at the bottom, so I have to strategically eat back and forth. For $4, it's not very filling, but I guess you would need to get a couple!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday at around 12:00pm as a group of 4 -- we didn't have to line up to order and we got a table nearby, WOOT!

Their dim sum was quite nice. We tried their taro dumplings*, siu mai*, pork and shrimp dumplings, and pork belly bao. (*my top picks). It's nice to try once or twice, because as someone who comes from the suburbs, there are just too many economical and tasty options in  Markham/Richmond Hill/Scarborough that you can eat to your heart's content without breaking your wallet. 

Nonetheless, this is a good, quick dim sum option in DT.  Worth a try!~"}
{"text":"One moment I am walking on an abandoned road, cold and hungry, the next moment I am climbing a giant BAO tree(from a planted BAOstalk (hah!), that only cost me just a bit over 4$). I climb way past the clouds, into a magical land in the sky, full of riches and beautiful gardens. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but here it does! Actually, anything you can possibly imagine grows on trees here. This is a world with no dreams, because the dreams here are just the reality.... I pinch myself, but nothing happens. I realize this isn't some weird interpretation of the Jack and the beanstalk fairy tail. This is to be expected because this is not a dream - it is what I came to call a Mean Bao experience. Who knew that for such a small price you can get so much? The only \"mean\" thing about mean bao is that they are not open 24/7 and there isn't a store at every corner."}
{"text":"The owner made up the mistake on calculating my order(she told me higher price for my order) but fixed it after I told her. She was kind to help me pick up the drink. Dinsum was really good-moisture and delicious on every bites. Bao was a little bit blend to me. Overall, good place for a small quality snacks but the portion is bit smaller for what you can expect for that price. Willing to go and eat again when I just need small portion."}
{"text":"They are located in the OCAD Food Court in the Village by The Grange condo building

A new twist on the Ban Mi Boys claim to fame

The Bao is a doughy chinese steamed bun filled with things like pulled pork with bbq sauce, deep fried tofu in peanut sauce, chicken, pork belly and even curried calamari.

I truly enjoyed the tofu and curried calamari version as BMB does not offer these variations.

Toppings include the carrot threads, red pepper and cucumber.

I found them to be excellent and the fresh ingredients on that first bite says \"i am glad i chose this\"

They also have other items of interest like quinoa bowls with vegetables in a hot sauce.

They are also crazy enough to also offer Dim Sum during lunch and a quick glance shows them to look to be in fine form.

Looks like this is a multiple visit place or a strong reason to go to school here."}
{"text":"MEAN!!! The place outside looks super hip and cute. Like one of the cool kids on the block, I knew I had to duck into this place and grab something.

The place is suuuuper tiny, and it can probably fit under 10 people. There are about 5-7 spots at a small bar area to 'dine in'. They have cute little decor like a 'mean bao' tshirt and other cutesey things that I adore. The people that work there are very nice and useful! The baos were done in a few min, to my surprise. Yay! They serve regular dim sum things and the famous baos.. mmmm. I had the pork belly one and it was JUST DELISH! Makes my belly rumble just thinking about it.. and that's coming from somebody who usually doesn't touch pork. Boyfriend had the pulled pork and that was very delicious too! Nice and juicy tender pork in a bao. Yummy. 

Everything was on par and I just ADORE. The only thing that was a little off was the inadequacy of the seating (good thing we came at an empty time!) and some of the table areas were a bit sticky.. but still, I'd definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I found the filling tasty, but the bun was so thick and a little overwhelming to the great filling. Just mouthfuls of buns.Had the tofu and anoki mushroom. Service was quick and staff very friendly"}
{"text":"I love bao's in general. Located in the Grange plaza near OCAD, I ordered some lunch through the Ritual app. It was prepared quite quickly. I ordered one of their combo deals which comes with 2 bao's and their spicy cucumber smash the pork belly bao and jerk chicken bao. I thoroughly enjoyed both bao's. You can taste the nice fattiness of the pork belly as you divulge more into the bao. Quite delicious and highly recommended. The jerk chicken bao has nice spice to the flavors and chicken is moist and juicy. The combo also comes with this spicy cucumber smash dish. Whatever sauce they put the cucumbers in, it was actually quite spicy as my mouth was burning. Overall, a great place to get your bao fix. You won't necessarily be hungry but you will enjoy the quality of the bao's. Will definitely be back for more delicious bao's!!"}
{"text":"Funnily enough, I enjoyed the cold noodle salad more than I enjoyed the pulled pork bao. While they were both really good, the hint of coconut in the marinated noodles went really well with the tofu, peanuts, cilantro and red radish. The noodles were also surprisingly filling! The pulled pork needed a bit more pulled pork. Will definitely be coming back to try out more of their items!"}
{"text":"Nice cheap place for a quick meal. Baos are priced between $4-5 and they have a few other dishes as well, including a limited dim sum selection. 

I ordered 2 baos - the jerk chicken and the pork belly. Out of the two, i'd likely try the pork belly again. It was simple - cucumber, hoisin sauce, peanuts, cilantro. I found the jerk chicken a little dry and not enough heat for my taste.

This location is much more spacious than the Queen/Bathurst location - the only other one I've been to. It's got a large communal table as well as a handful of tables for smaller parties.

Good quick stop if you're in the area. They have a good variety of items so there's enough to entice multiple return visits if you're into baos."}
{"text":"This place is ok but was very underwhelming. I got the tofu bao, the tofu was just like the \"deep fried\" stuff you can get in a package from the supermarket and it was not hot or fresh. There was way more bun than stuffing, and the bun itself was spongey (not In a good way). The one really good thing about this was the peanut sauce."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a cozy solo lunch here the other day. Small space with communal tables, clean and bright.

Enjoyed two baos - one tofu and one pork, both were delicious. Food arrived quickly and was very fresh. The buns were very soft and fillings were bright and tasty.

Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Order: chicken Bao, beef Bao, pork Bao. 
Unfortunately Bao were nuked to be heated up I think and were super dry. 

The chicken was dry and tasteless. 

Beef was well done and flavoured, perfectly moist. The sliver of bok choy was musty tasting :( . And I was disappointed by sriracha being used as the heat component. 

As friendly as the staff was, this location was terrible , maybe the food was bad cos it was nearly closing time- I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The sloppy Joes and braised beef Bao are wonderful. The Bao is very soft, fluffy and pillowy. The meat has wonderful seasoning and a nice spicy kick. The vegetables in the Bao cut the fat from the meat. It makes for a relatively healthy meal!"}
{"text":"Nice concept, but food is mediocre. The concept is fresh and creative. The flavour profiles are not there, the sauces overppwer every item, all you can taste is the sauce. There are a lot of interesting textures to every bite, but the flavour profiling definitely needs some tweaking."}
{"text":"Fast service and good food. What more could you want. My favourite is the dim sum."}
{"text":"Ordered the braised beef bao, pork belly bao, and cold noodle salad. The braised beef bao is quite tough and dry, and I'm not a fan of the flavour (or lack of). The pork belly bao was definately better, as it melts in your mouth. Suprisingly, I loved the cold noodle salad best (I did not use the dressing). It's cool and refreshing, plus the fried tofu is savoury and flavourful."}
{"text":"My friends have told me a lot about the mean bao chain and I finally managed to go. I was intrigued at a western concept of chinese steam buns. 

The Leslieville location is small and very intimate that seats roughly 20 people at max capacity. Its located in a random location you wouldn't expect to find a good restaurant. This is the place I would go to for a quick lunch  with friends  but not for a full out meal.

Everyone raves about the hosin pork belly, and though it was tasty i found the flavor was heavy and hard to swallow after a few bites. My personal favorite is the tekken chicken a nice combination of sweet and spicy and meaty chicken thigh paired with a pickled daikon.

The snacks are abit pricey I found, for the size that you get but if you're looking to enjoy light lunch out with friends, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"The Grange usually has quick and cheap meals but I'd say that Mean Bao's prices are higher than average and their portion sizes are also fairly small. For a lunch, 2 buns are on the lighter side but 3 buns starts to near the higher end of a lunch budget, especially considering that Mean Bao is a serve yourself, food court type place.

I came for lunch and waited around 5-10 minutes for my lunch, which was a little longer than I was expecting, considering it was a food court and their menu is already fairly limited. The pork belly and pulled pork buns were alright. Definitely a little messy to eat and fairly oily though. The pork belly one was definitely yummier, but I think it would have been too overwhelming to have 2 pork belly buns.

Overall, if I was craving a snack, I might come for their pork belly bun, but then again, for the price ($4.25 + tax) for one bun, I'm not sure that it's quite worth it."}
{"text":"Inexpensive. Yummy. I found the pork belly bao a little sweet but overall, good flavour. I got medium spiciness but did added more hot sauce. I would love to try a different flavour next time. The shrimp dumplings were good also. Total was $10 with a can of Coke Zero :)"}
{"text":"I've had the pork belly baos at Mean bao twice - they are delicious and one of my favourite pork belly baos in the city. The pork belly is juicy and flavoured while the bao is soft and fluffy. On one of my visits, I tried the dim sum which was a mistake - stick with the baos! 

Mean bao is hip and gives off that \"hole in the wall\" vibe. However, the seating inside is very limited. If you come with a big group, consider sitting outside during the summer."}
{"text":"Great tasting bao, all the right textures and flavours. definitely a winner in the weird grange food court. 

Only four stars because I wasn't absolutely dieing after eating it, but for the price and place, it's a solid bao. 

Plus \"mean bao\" is a great pun - it's how you say bread in Cantonese :)"}
{"text":"EDIT: The restaurant apologized for this, returned the meal as credit, and gave us a credit for future use. They seemed genuinely sorry they had messed up - so updating the review for them taking the time to make things right. Side note: the purple rice dishes are pretty boss.

Walked over to get takeout, they only gave us half the order (the guy working there confirmed the order before handing it over). Got home, the squad all looking to eat and less than half the food was there. When we called the restaurant, they did nothing to fix it: gave us a credit. Which of course doesn't put dinner on the table. Options offered included walking back 20+ minutes? Thanks for that.

Great food; hot garbage pile of service."}
{"text":"This place serves a mean bao. There's been a lot of back and forth as to who makes the better bao (Mean or BMB) but I am here to settle the score. At least for bao wise, I find MB to have a slightly bigger portion and the flavour profile is a bit more layered than BMB. There's an added touch of peanuts and sriracha that really brings new dimensions to the taste. Don't get me wrong, BMB is still great. Their flavours are clean and straightforward which is great too but I guess it comes down to personal preference.

MB/BMB, you can't really wrong but I will deduct a star for their inconsistency. While the Grange location serves great food, I can't say the same of their second location near Bathurst. I would avoid this location."}
{"text":"Once is a fluke, twice is luck and three times is success! in this case Mean Bao can only be summed up as a fluke. This is the third location that spawned from the original at The Grange and it is vastly different from it's originators in success.

The baos are the same and the ingredients and menu are the same but different is the balance. These baos feel flat and one dimensional; a sweet on sweet on sweet slumber party. From the subtle sweetness of the buns to that of the few vegetables and ultimately that even sweeter hoisin sauce - this bao will have you in a diabetic coma in no time. With that being said the buns are deliciously delicate and fluffy while it blankets your mouth like curling into warm sheets during a winter storm. The pork belly is tender and meaty like fine bone marrow and that signature five spice really does pull through with some herby goodness from the cilantro. Just wish there was more vegetables and some sort of acid to cut the sweetness overload and the fattiness from that pork. Mean Bao 3 is obviously not nearly as mean as the first.

With the great TDOT going through a bao revolution these guys ought to pick up their game! There's no mercy for a lethargic bao; especially not in the current state of the cutthroat bao-down in this town!"}
{"text":"I got myself a pork belly bao and it was gooooooood! They don't cheap out on their pork belly, and served a well balanced chunks of pork belly and fats. I don't normally like fats but I didn't pick them out this time. Yum! It's one mean pork belly bao for sure!"}
{"text":"That is a great, great restaurant! Casual and yet good ambiance, great food and yet affordable price! The options are also good and both times I've been there I have tried different things and I loved them all. Looking forward for a 3rd time :)"}
{"text":"House made chilli oil was the reason I crave for siu mai here. Loved the street food vibe. Not pretentious. Always get the pork belly bap extra spicy and the siu mai."}
{"text":"My entire body was prickling and itchy after eating here!

It was really delicious, but I think I had a food allergy, which almost never happens!!
(I think it was some magic spice they used)

But I will be back!!!

Pretty cheap and good snacky!!!!"}
{"text":"No frills downtown location of the Mean Bap franchise is simple and straightforward.

The menu items are posted in the wall to the left of you when you walk up the stairs to the joint. 

Points against: Not very engaging service. Guy at counter didn't say more than minimum or thank for tip. Also no wheelchair access. Doesn't affect me, but would others.

Points for: Good prices for above average buns. I got the pork belly and braised beef ones and they were both tasty. Seating area is adequate and air conditioning was going good on a sweltering day. Also have debit, not cash only. Girl who made food was friendly.

Good for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"It's okay. After I tried their Pork Belly Bao and Jerk Chicken Bao, I'd fairly say it's not the best Bao I've had so far in Toronto. In fact, it's rather generic. 

I asked for spicy, but I didn't like the spicy sauce they put on the Bao. Also jerk chicken tasted nothing like jerk chicken, it's just grilled chicken. 

Price wise it was more expensive than the other Bao places."}
{"text":"This location doesn't seem as good as the Grange one. I usually end up getting the pork belly bao, which is prob the best one out of them all. I've tried the dumplings and the sui mai and while I'm sure they are good right away, once they put it in the box, it becomes a mess. I forgot to take a photo, but if you saw from my photo at the other location, it's still the same problem that these 4 pieces move all over the place in the box and just doesn't look appetizing when you open it.

They also pack the baos in these wraps now, which I find keeps the moisture in and makes the bun soggy. It used to be in brown boxes which was presented better and had air vents.

Point being: eat in if you can, otherwise, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Came to this place a few weeks ago. Got 2 baos (5 spice and pulled pork) and the shrimp + pork dumplings. 

Mean baos were decent sized. Fresh ingredients and good bao texture. The dumplings on the other hand seemed sloppily put together.

While i think the food is decent, the prices are fairly expensive for what you get hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Very small, more like a to-go/takeout place. Ordered the pulled pork bao and it was in fact, very delicious. The bao also had some crushed peanuts sprinkled on top, which was a nice touch compared to a typical bao. The bao was however, very small so I would recommend buying two baos in order to make you full. Will come back in the future and try out the other baos they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Mostly known for their pork belly bao. They are similar to other pork belly bao you can find at Momofuku or Banh Mi Boys, but at slightly cheaper ($3.50 each). However, the quality is not as good as the other two. The meat is not as soft and there is not enough fillings considering the size of bao. I guess you get what you paid for...

This place is tiny and there are only 7 seats, so it is ideal for take out. Service is decent, but nothing's really special.

If you are in the area looking for a quick bite, this is a decent choice."}
{"text":"Really cute please and the bao's were pretty good. The dough was fluffy and the fillings were all served hot. The shop is in a cafe that is connected to OCAD university. 

I had the Tofu and Enoki Mushroom Bao and a Pulled Pork Bao. The tofu was the kind most people use for hot pot and the peanut sauce complimented and pulled the entire dish together. The pulled pork was tender and extreme flavourful. It pulled a part nicely and the sauce was sweet and a little spicy. 

All and all a really nice place, would definitely come again and try their other bao's and dim sum."}
{"text":"Had the pork belly and braised beef bao, medium spicy. The pork belly bao was savory, flavorful and balanced. The braised beef was oddly flavorless and gristly. The bao for both was soft and fluffy and just slightly sweet. Also, I have it on good authority that the pulled pork is good.

In summation, stick to the pork."}
{"text":"I work at Leslieville & I always look for lunch spots.  Loved \"Back of House\" originally but was sad that it closed down.  Walk by the store few days ago and was surprised that \"Mean Bao\" was going to open soon.  \"Mean Bao\" means chinese buns and they have lots of variety to offer.  Each item is $4 or less and $10 typically means a good lunch.  Jerk chicken is only available at this location & I'm looking forward to try the cold noodles!"}
{"text":"Pretentious, tiny portions for the price of a meal. Not nearly enough fillings. Got flagged not long ago as unsanitary on dinesafe. Go around the corner to BahnMi Boyz!"}
{"text":"I used to work not too far away, and ended up coming to the Grange pretty frequently for a speedy, yet delicious, inexpensive lunch. Mean Bao is tucked deep into the Grange food court (under the sunroof, as a point of reference), where I normally I ordered: a) the pork belly bao, and b) the tofu enoki bao.

Hands down, the pork belly bao was my absolute favourite. It literally melts in your mouth. The bun wasn't overly stuffed, but they didn't skimp on the meat either. It was the perfect bun to meat ratio (there's a sentence I never thought I'd say...!). The tofu enoki bao was also super fresh, with a ton of flavour. This is a great, quick fast-food option if you're ever around the University and Dundas area! 

For two baos and a drink, my total normally came to a little less than $10.00."}
{"text":"5 stars - would eat again!

This is a great spot for a satisfying, inexpensive lunch in the middle of Toronto tucked away in a food court. This past visit, I tried their jerk chicken bao and tofu with enoki bao. Both featured a well-balanced contrast of textures and flavours. 

The line can get long, but it moves fast. To combat this, it seems like they have something where you can order ahead on your phone and pickup. That seems worth checking out if this is a favourite of yours."}
{"text":"Presentation is cute. They serve your baos in dim sum containers too. However, the baos tasted a tad mediocre and slightly dry."}
{"text":"Visually this place has very good aesthetics but I am not a huge fan of the tastes as I don't find it savoury or flavourful enough. Don't think I'd come back but if you're in the area, it's a cute spot to check out and try."}
{"text":"I'd been to Mean Bao last summer, it was great, ordered it off UberEats today and TERRIBLE the quality of the meat - rank, the buns seemed stale, even the pork dumplings were hard - like the meat inside was Taco Bell meat or something. Just absolutely awful will not be going back ever."}
{"text":"Mean Bao is a breath of fresh air to Toronto's(especially Chinatown area) rather interesting assortment of Chinese food. Rather than the \"drown it in oil, sugar, and salt\" strategy of many of the greasy-spoon takeout places around here (which to be fair has a place), Mean Bao's main weapon is flavour, and lots of it. 

Famous Bao pulls from a distinctly Northeastern Chinese palette- porkbelly, cumin, sauces and meat aplenty here- but with a bit of a modern fusion twist. If you're looking to broaden your horizons and try some more adventurous Chinese food, this is the place. I mean, they've even got ethnic carbonated juice. 

My personal recommendation here is the pork belly bao and jerk chicken bao. Portion size is a-ok for the price, lots of flavor, and well made dumplings- soft and fresh but with a slight bit of playful chewiness. 

Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here with my BF to grab a quick lunch. It's a small but cute restaurant. The staff were very friendly! We ordered the pork belly bao, tofu & enoki mushroom bao & the sticky quinoa! The pork belly lacks some flavour as I would've preferred a stronger taste. However when paired with the rest of the ingredients the overall taste was satisfying still when you're hungry. The tofu & enoki mushroom bao had a stronger flavour due to the marinade the tofu was saturated in. Taste wise, it wasn't bad but if you compared it to Banh Mi Boys steamed baos, Banh Mi Boys packs a more flavourful punch! The Sticky Quinoa was recommended by the staff but my BF wasn't a fan of it. I didn't mind it too much since I love lap Cheong!! The quinoa was an Asian fusion touch but it was too soggy for the texture compared to the regular sticky rice used. A tad bit salty for my liking but a unique concept! Would recommend coming here to grab a bite as a snack but not a full on meal!"}
{"text":"It's not very often I get to go to Toronto, so when I have the chance, I want to hit up as many places as I can while I am in the area.  I was really interested in trying out some \"Bao\", basically a Korean or Vietnamese bun sandwich.  This sandwich is actually in many Asian cultures (Chinese, Filipino, Japanese) all with similar ingredients and cooked the same way.  I had recently bookmarked Bahn Mi Boys, but my brother told me about the place called Mean Bao beside his house so we gave that a try.  Located on the corner of Richmond and Spadina, if your not looking for it you can easily pass it on the street.  The store is very small, basically enough room for the service counter and 2 tables beside the wall.  You literally cannot have more than 5 people in the store at once

The menu isn't very big, but they hit all right taste notes with their selections to make the sandwiches sound good.  I opted for the most popular Pork Belly Bao (the most popular one according to the staff).  Cucumbers, hoisin sauce and pork belly filled a small 5\" Bao ( a little on the small side for a sandwich).  The taste was excellent, but the portion size and price ($3.95) knocked it down a few stars.  They also offer some Dim Sum items such as Siu Mai and dumplings.  

Quick bite to eat...check
Cheap cost...on the fence
Good flavour...check
Seating...ummm ok..
Small portion....depends on what you call a good size

Mean Bao..3 Stars"}
{"text":"This unassuming little place has big flavour and is perfect for a quick meal! The bao are soft and fresh, the dumplings are flavorful and the selection is great.

The braised beef and pork belly are the stars of the show with the jerk chicken being a bit on he dull side. 

There's no alcohol and seating is limited, but it's still worth a stop in for a great and cheap meal!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Mean Bao for a while after hearing about this place for so long. Now that I work nearby, I decided to give Mean Bao a try for lunch today.

Mean Bao is quite hard to find; it's one of the last food court stalls inside the Village By The Grange food court, across from Est West. There's usually a respectable lineup, but their turnover is quick so don't be discouraged by the lineup.

I ordered one of their lunch combos, consisting of a pork belly bao, siu mai dumplings, and a can of Sprite. Despite the fact there were about 4 orders ahead of me after I ordered, I managed to get my order in about 2 minutes. Not bad for a fast food place!

When I opened the wrap for the pork belly bao, I immediately noticed a flaw, which was that the bao itself had a very \"scrunchy\" texture. I've had baos before, and a good bao is where the texture is smooth and slightly on the chewy side; this bao was neither as it was rough and slightly soggy. The pork belly was decent, but nothing to write home about.

The siu mai dumplings were quite good for fast food quality. The meat was a little tough, but the flavour was there and that's really mostly what I care about when it comes to fast food dim sum.

For now, I'm not too fond on coming back to this Mean Bao branch. Maybe I'll try the actual restaurant branches that they have?"}
{"text":"Had the pork belly bao and pork dumplings. YUM. So good!! And they carry a rare (?) root beer - I need to grab one on the way out."}
{"text":"It's just ok. I came in with high expectation from all the glowing reviews, but it's average. Portions were small, with little fillings."}
{"text":"I've been here years ago but I forgot to review it. I had the jerk chime Bao and some other naps one of the best naps I ever had they make their naps fro scratch small place the food is damn tasty. And I had the Hargow which is really good as well. If I'm at Bathurst again I would come back here"}
{"text":"The baos here aren't cheap considering the size but it's done very well. I got the pork belly bao for about $4. I love the touch of crumbled peanuts on top. You get to choose the spiciness of the bao. I got it in mild and add Sriracha sauce to make it the spicy level that I can handle."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service.  Would definitely come again.  My Taiwanese girlfriend said it's not the same as in Taiwan, but she loved it all the same.

We had the pork belly and braised pork buns with a mapo tofu... I think most people could eat all that by themselves so don't be afraid to order lots and try everything!"}
{"text":"Had the pork belly mean bao. Delicious little snack between meals! The bao (bread) is so incredibly soft, I have not had soft bread like that before. Would come here with a small group of friends as seating is somewhat limited, or do take-out."}
{"text":"Oh yes, mean bao! Delicious, quick, quiet, professional service and friendly staff. Easy take out, accepts cards or Apple Pay. I highly recommend the baos, especially the specials of the day. My favorite is chicken curry but they all are equally delicious. Quinoa bowl is a very healthy and low calorie choice. Taro dim sum is a light option for vegans."}
{"text":"For my first time eating a Bao... Money well spent!! Had the Pork Belly and Jerk Chicken(Limited Time Offer) and really enjoyed it. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is pretty tasty, but they are 17 kinds of useless for takeout. The menu online is not the same as the one in the restaurant, we waited nearly half an hour for one of our three orders (with no line ahead of us), and when we finally got our food it was the wrong stuff. 

Overall a bit too annoying to contend with, and the food is great but not worth that. If you use Hurrier type apps, it's a bit better, but still pretty inefficient (especially considering how small a menu they are working with)."}
{"text":"You need to eat a lot of Bao's to fill you up.
Portions are too small.
Quality is ok."}
{"text":"Pulled Pork Bao is pretty tasty. The Jerk Chicken one is super dry and doesn't taste like jerk chicken at all. To be honest when I was eating it I had no idea it was the jerk chicken bao at first. I can't see myself running back here for lunch anytime soon... a little disappointing and not very filling for over 10 bucks. I think you can do better elsewhere and get better baos elsewhere."}
{"text":"Reasonable price meals, and the baos are fairly large.
I tried the braised beef and the pulled pork, and I would get the braised beef again but probably not the pulled pork. They were out of jerk chicken sadly...

I'd definitely give them another go. Great to have a bao place like this in the East End."}
{"text":"I like it here! Its a cute little tucked away shop with the most simplistic design ever, but its all in the details. They've got those bare walls with a \"BAO\" decor, some green chopsticks, an aqua coloured cart, its all so minimalistic, but also so homey at the same time.

Their bao was really good, and for a good price! I love the idea of asian fusion. I had a pulled pork with apple slaw bao, and it was delicious for $4! For snack, thats a yummy deal.

The service is also really good, the people behind the counter are so nice :) and i saw one of them eating a noodle dish that he said the kitchen is testing, and it looks mighty amaze-balls. Will be back soon for it"}
{"text":"This location is the original one and Mean Bao now have another location just opened on Bathurst Street. While I can't comment on the service at the second location, but it seems the owner is always at the OCAD's location and I found the service to be ok. It's the typical service you would get at a food court restaurant, minus the yelling of course.

*Sticky Quinoa (Chicken, Lap Cheong, Steam Vegetables) - $8.25: 
it was quite a generous portion for just $8! To be honest it was quite awkward trying to open the lotus leaf in the tiny and narrow take out box, so it would have been better if they served this in a bigger box.

When my order came, the lotus leaf was already opened with the egg and chicken on top, so I wasn't sure if they actually steamed the quinoa with those 2 components? I quite enjoyed the texture of the sticky quinoa, however I found the flavor of the lap cheong was not apparent in the dish. Which resulted in a sticky quinoa that didn't have the sweet sausage (lap cheong) and salty seasonings that you would normal find in a lo mai gai. Also, the smell of the lotus leaf was quite strong that it lingered? I hope that make sense, because the leaf should only add a subtle fragrance to the dish. Also, my vegetables were slightly undercooked :(...  I think this is an interesting take on a classic sticky rice in lotus leaf, however I prefer the latter more.

*Sloppy Jones Bao (cucumber, green onion) - $3.85: 
The sloppy jones consisted of ground pork simmered in ketchup and I believe some kind of chili oil. The bao had good flavor with a balance between salty and spiciness, and it wasn't greasy as well. My friend's bao hold up well while eating, but mine was the total opposite and it was really messy to eat this bao :(.

*Pulled Pork (Apple Slaw) - $3.80/each: 
The pulled pork came with apple slaw and was dressed with cilantro, and crushed peanuts. The baos were warm and wonderfully soft, slightly sweet and practically melted in your mouth. Although the pulled pork was tender and juicy, it tasted just like any other pulled pork that I have had. The slaws were good and brought down the richness of the pulled pork, and the Sriracha amped up the spice level. The bao was good, but to me it was nothing special so if you are looking for something different, get other baos.

*Pork & Shrimp dumplings (carrot, cilantro, green onion) - $3.85: 
Initially I wanted the siu mai and other dumplings but they were all sold out. The owner told me they make the dim sum fresh everyday, and he only had the pork & shrimp dumplings left on the day I went. For $4, the dumplings were at the right size, had loads of shrimps inside and I really enjoyed them! The skin was translucent yet study, slightly chewy with perfectly cooked fillings inside."}
{"text":"Came to this place for lunch after going to the AGO, I previously went to the other location near Queen St. so I decided to visit this one. It was nice to see no lines and lots of empty tables for us to sit (I was with 4 people), and the woman who served me was really pleasant and attentive to my peanut allergy which was much appreciated. 

The food was a solid 3.5-4/5. I got the beef and red cabbage dumplings, which were satisfying after a busy day at the gallery. However, my only complaint would be that the dumpling filling was slightly dense and \"soft-ball\" like, and the lack of condiments which were necessary given the flavours of the food, only soya sauce and sriracha. The soya sauce was in packets, forcing me to take a handful and carefully squeeze each one out into a tiny plastic cup to use. Tedious, but well worth it. Other than that, we all enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"The food & selection (3/5): They serve two main types of food: baos (various meat and/or veggies on steamed buns) and dimsum. We got four baos: pork belly, braised beef, pulled pork and jerk chicken.

-Pork belly (3/5): One piece of pan-fried pork belly on the steamed bun, topped with cucumber and hoisin sauce. I almost always order pork belly when i see them on the menu. These baos they have are quite similar to the ones at Banh Mi Boys so I thought they would taste similar...but I was quite disappointed after my first bite. The pork belly was not as tasty as I would imagine (mind you, I don't mean it's lacking flavour; in fact it's quite salty, but I guess I'd say the flavour wasn't spot on).
-Braised beef (3.5/5): Decent amount of braised beef pieces on the steamed bun, topped with bok choy and pickles. It's a little spicy but I think I like this one the best out of all the flavours. The only down side was the bitter bok choy...
-Jerk chicken (2/5): I really wouldn't say this was jerk chicken. Pretty much after the second bite, my lips were all numb (I can normally handle spicy food quite well). The coleslaw topping didn't help. Also I couldn't quite taste the chicken because of the spiciness, and it's just not what jerk chicken should taste like. 
-Pulled pork (3/5): Pulled pork, topped with apple slaw. The BBQ sauce was a little too sweet and didn't seem to have fused with the pork.

Cost (4/5): About $4+tax per bao, so it came to under $20 for two which is pretty reasonable.

Service (4.5/5): It's fast food style. The staffs were quite friendly and the food was ready within 5 minutes.

Ambience (3.5/5): The place wasn't busy when we first walked in so we managed to get a seat. There are only 8 seats in the restaurant in front of the counter along the wall. So it became quite crowded when more people were in there waiting for food. Since it's more of a grab-and-go and there is limited standing/sitting space, people tend to leave once they get their food."}
{"text":"The day after I heard Prince had died I was biking from one meeting to the next and realized I hadn't had a proper lunch. Tummy grumbling I turned to bike up Bathurst and heard \"When The Doves Cry\" coming from a little restaurant \"Mean Bao.\" I had no idea what to expect but had enjoyed Dim Sum in the past so in I went. It was at an odd hour for a meal - 3:30pm - so it was nice and empty and I quickly chose the tofu bao and some dumplings. Because the prices were low I thought they would be tiny but I could easily have had one as a snack. The tofu bao with enoki mushrooms, peanut sauce and burnt sugar was TO DIE FOR. I'll never forget that particular concoction - fluffy sponge \"taco\" wrapped around fresh, crunchy, hot, saucy, DELICIOUSNESS. Dumplings were solid but the bao won the day."}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times since it's close to where I work. It's a little expensive for what you get, but I guess I'm a small eater, and so one bao is enough for me. When my husband comes, he gets two baos and dumplings, and he's still not full, and it's kind of expensive. But it's tasty! I get the pork belly."}
{"text":"OK but not nearly as good as Banh Mi Boys. Too much sauce, not enough filling. Baos do not have the same satisfying pillowy-ness."}
{"text":"Came to check this place out with hubby. It wasn't busy at all, we were the only customers when we walked in on a Friday evening. Ordered 2 buns each and shared dim sum. It was okay. Could have eaten more; buns are small. Found it a bit pricey. I'm glad we tried it since it was on our list. Would not be going back most likely."}
{"text":"Mean Bao came as an Uber Eats desperation move for me today. I preface with the fact that I didn't in fact order any of their Bao, but went straight for the Dim Sum options. Lunch consisted of shrimp and pork dumplings with quinoa and Asian slaw, pork and red cabbage dumplings and shrimp dumplings.

As a veteran Dim Sum fan I must say I was pretty disappointed. The shell around the shrimp dumplings was thick and floury, and the pork based dumplings had very dry, densely packed filling. I suppose the food was indicative of the price point, but if I ever have any future encounters I'll make sure to stick to the Bao."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to go to one of these establishments for a while now, just never had the time. However the other day we were driving by this location to pick up someone and I said we NEED to make the stop. 

So we did a quick little one. Ordered a pork belly bao (no nuts), siu mai and shrimp dumplings (hargow) to go. The place was empty as we got there around 2:45pm so the food was freshly made (which perhaps it always is?) However the time of waiting for the food was not that long at all. 

Pork Belly Bao - It tasted good, the pork belly itself tasted like it could be marinated a little longer because i didn't really taste any seasoning. All the ingredients together definitely satisfied a craving.

The dim sum was for le boyfriend. He indicated that the siu mai kind of tasted slightly bland. The size is HUGE tho! The shrimp dumplings were okay as well. 

I would come back to try other things !"}
{"text":"baos are amazing. my favorite is pulled pork bao. juicy flavorful. had their dim sum too. not bad. but I'm not a dim sum enthusiast so can't really tell if it great or not. but bao. go for it."}
{"text":"Although I really liked the food here, their slow service is something that annoys me. 
I understand that it takes time to steam the buns and dumplings but I waited for 20 minutes for two mean bao. I ordered the braise beef and pork belly and they were both tasty and very nicely seasoned.  I personally prefer the braised beef. 

I would personally prefer to order online or call ahead to avoid the wait. The prices area also not bad and the buns was very soft but nothing too different from other mean bao."}
{"text":"The dim sum is just straight up bad. I've tried pretty much every dumpling they have and they are all equally bad.  The dumplings are often broken and ripped apart. The dumpling shell is hardened like pasta that's been sitting outside a little too long. Honestly, the frozen dim sum I get from T&T is better than this dim sum. 

I understand that pork belly has some fat but my Pork Belly Bao should have been called Big Wad of Fat Bao. I discarded 80% of it and was left with a little piece of chewy meat. Banh Mi Boys baos are so much better than here."}
{"text":"I came back and tried other items.
No, other than the tofu bao, everything else I had thus far tasted pretty bad... They look pretty, but dont taste fresh. The cold noodle was very soft and wierd...

The service is really really great and the food is still cheap. So for a snack, yes. But dont order a bunch of stuff..."}
{"text":"Small shop that sells pretty good mainstream bao. Not much room to eat but you can gobble it up pretty fast. They made it pretty fast and I enjoyed it. 

Got the pulled pork - delicious, braised beef - not bad, tofu - surprisingly good! And the chicken - a bit dry. Under $4 each. 

Definitely a must try. We then ended off the night by going to bahn mi. A night well done!"}
{"text":"I tried their one of their specials. The taro dumplings and a tofu boa. It was decent, nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is located at the food court, but the taste is better than the average food court ;) They create a very successful fusion of western and oriental ingredients. If you happen to be around, this place should be on your must-try list."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer at this place and finally tried the dim sum today. 

This review is based on the dim sum, Siu Mai. 

The Siu Mai is made with minced pork and a shrimp and topped with fish roe. The order comes with 4 bite-size Siu Mai. The size is just right and you can eat the whole Siu Mai with juicy pork and bouncy shrimp. It is authentic style of dim sum supposed to be. 

It will be a nice afternoon snack or morning breakfast."}
{"text":"Honestly I would have given a 3 but my wife says her vegetarian bao took her to flavour town :) so I will give a 4.

We had the rice bowl special with the braised beef and pork belly and poached egg. The braised beef surprised me, it was super flavourful and tender. The pork belly was very good too and everything combined had great flavours and texture. They also had some home made chili sauce which tasted very good with the rice. It wasn't that spicy though and being Chinese, it could have been spicier. Had my share of dim sum and asian food so I think its hard to compare to all the dim sum places, but the rice bowl was pretty good. Could have been bigger for the price but its all good.

She had the noodles and the vegetarian bao. She loved it and would come again since she said it had crazy good flavours."}
{"text":"For nearly $9, you'd expect a filling lunch but I was still left hungry after two baos. The baos however were indeed flavourful. The spicy chicken bao was my clear-cut favourite. I liked the pork belly bao as well but I found the pork belly to be just a bit too fatty. The portion of bao to meat and vegetables was good, I just wish that it was less expensive."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a light lunch a few days ago and just had to come back! I ordered the Siu Mai and the chicken and on my second visit, pork belly baos. My order each time came under $10 which is pretty flippin' awesome. And surprisingly it was very filling, the portion sizes are just right!

The siu mai is good, just like anywhere else but I noticed the quantity and size changed on my subsequent visit. The first time there were about 6 pieces and they were average sized. The second time I got 4 pieces and they were gigantic! I didn't feel cheated either way but do prefer the smaller size (weird, I know).

The baos I tried were excellent, perfect blend of flavours, textures and great \"snack\" size and priced just right. I feel like they should've gone the crunchy way with the pork belly but it was more like a fatty pulled pork - and they have pulled pork on the menu so...trust me and pan fry that sucker a la lechon kiwali.

Shout out to the fellow cross stitcher!"}
{"text":"I had the jerk chicken, braised beef, and taro dumplings. The chicken was dry, and the dumpling were very sticky and dry up top. Wasn't fresh for meal of the day.

But the flavour was good, and so were the available sauces on the counter. I enjoyed the beef, and the taste of the jerk chicken. Will come back because the prices are good. Under 5$"}
{"text":"Being new in the area, first thing was first - finding good food. My first journey leads me a block away to Mean Bao. After having Banh Mi Boys several times, I thought it'd be nice to have something to compare it to.

Judging by the lack of reviews, I assume this establishment is relatively new. The decor is very simplistic, boasting brick walls coated in white. Customers are open to sit anywhere they please and chopsticks are readily available in a cup on the table.

First up for comparison is the Pork Belly steamed bao. The steamed bao here are a tad bit on the smaller side. Flavour is pretty good, but I think the amount of hoisin sauce overpowers the bao a bit. I think the bao itself is screaming for more veg (something more than just cukes).

The pork and shrimp dumplings though are well done! Definitely my favourite of the two. Juicy and meaty - they don't skimp on the meat. I want aware of the spice levels for this, but their spiciest is just sriracha, apparently.

The prices are alright, but I don't expect to come here every single time. I could convince myself to go more if it was a tad cheaper, or the portion size got bigger though.

Still good though! I recommend to anyone in the area :)."}
{"text":"Mean Bao is an excellent choice if you're in the mood for restaurant quality bao and dim sum served at fast-food speeds. This location is one of three operating in busy sections of the city. 

Anticipate a line up at peak periods, but don't be discouraged because the staff work attentively to get customers served in prompt fashion. The whole menu lineup is affordable, which means you can try different options each time you visit without having to shell out too much.

Must-try items:
Braised Beef bao
Jerk Chicken bao
Chicken bao
Shrimp dumplings

If you haven't tried bao before, you should. Jerk chicken is the way to go, as the sauce goes perfectly and melts in your mouth. Even the buns are made to perfection. Overall this is one of my favourite spots for a convenient snack that I can eat on the spot or take to go."}
{"text":"The braised beef and chicken bao were on the dry side. I think they could have been saucier.  Pork belly was by far the tastiest boa I had (they had run out of sloppy jones). The shrimp dumplings were tasty but you get 4 tiny ones per order."}
{"text":"This place is the best. The food is so delicious and vegetarian friendly at a fair price. Service is really fast and usually really friendly too. I usually get the tofu and enoki bao and I love the flavours, its sweet, savoury and spicy and the bun is always so chewy. Great place to stop for a snack or grab a quick lunch. This location's pretty tucked away in the food court so really is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Found out about this location through the grabb app and spontaneously decided to give it a visit. Was definitely worth the trip ! My boyfriend and I found the baos very tasty and delicious. We ordered the pulled pork, braised pork and siu mais and savoured every bite. The pricing was reasonable as well. Although the venue was small and crammed the food made up for it. We would definitely would pay this location another visit !"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 steamed baos for lunch and was still hungry afterwards. The bun was very doughly and would've liked to have more filling. I liked the tofu, mushroom, enoki bao (great flavours) and the pork belly one (too much fat). I probably wouldn't go back. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I\"ve been attending OCADU for the past 3 years and, honestly, I've grown really tired of the food in the grange. I've tried everything in the place and I'm absolutely sick of it. Mean Bao has been there for a few yeas but I naturally assumed it was going to be as terrible as everything else in the food court. 

Thank god I was wrong because now I finally have a place to have lunch that doesn't disappoint! 

I've tried the BBQ chicken and hot quinoa box which came in a generous portion for the price with tender, flavourful chicken and delicious steamed vegetables. Didn't much like the quinoa but I'm not a big fan of it in general. The chicken and veg were the stars. 

I also tried the chicken bao and, with a pop, it came to just over 5 dollars which is great for a light lunch that doesn't break the bank. The bao was soft,  slightly chewy and very fresh. The chicken was the same as is served in the quinoa box and was even better on a bao. 

I also tried the pork dumplings which were good but not really my cup of tea. 

I'm glad I found a yummy place to have lunch"}
{"text":"I ordered the pork belly bao.  It was tough and flavourless. Pricey for what you get. Staff was not very friendly.  I will stick to Banh mi boys."}
{"text":"Living and working in the King West neighbourhood is great. There are plenty of places to eat, but after a while you know what is good and what is bad.
There has been numerous turnovers in this space just south of Queen Street, primarily because that stretch of Bathurst doesn't get nowhere as much foot traffic as King or Queen Streets, but also it is a tiny space elevated from the street with very little street presence. There was a good burger place there which I Yelped about, but didn't survived for long and there was a sushi place which closed down before no one knew about it, and there were a few other fail attempts. So I am convinced it is one of the few cursed spaces that's in the area.

Happily I saw and heard about Mean Bao, a clever inter-lingual pun, and their second location from their successful Grange location. So I am hoping this will finally be a solid reputable eatery that will be operating here for the long run, and so far I think they will do well here.

There is limited amount of seating inside and when the weather finally gets warmer there are some seating outside, though the view and traffic of Bathurst is not the greatest when enjoying lunch. 
I ordered two baos: the braised pork and the pork belly which were both excellent. I loved how fluffy the steamed bun stayed by the time I brought it back to my office and it was dressed very nicely which I asked for it to be spicy which had the nice amount of heat. I also ordered a side of shrimp and pork dumplings which was also good but you really need to dip it in any of their sauces to fully enjoy it (there is a table of sauces which you could help yourself to, don't forget it).
It was all a very satisfying lunch and a few of my coworkers are a fan too."}
{"text":"Great food but my god, so overpriced. Close to $6 for a tiny bun that left me 3x more hungry...quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Mean Bao is a bun and dimsum fusion Asian restaurant. Came here for a casual dinner with some friends. They specialize in a variety of different bao combos with both Asian and Western flavors. They also have a dim sum menu and some other side dishes like noodles. This is a decent fast food Asian restaurant. Each bun/dimsum dish is ~5$. Would come back for a quick casual bite and if I was craving buns.

The venue is small, sitting ~15 people. Casual setting.

Ordered
Braised beef bun - braised beef and Taiwan pickles. Was pretty tasty. Makes me want to try other flavors. I think one would need 2 of these to constitute a meal.
Shrimp dumpings - Were okay. I was expecting Cantonese dim sum \"har gow\". But the dumplings had an egg noodle; kind seemed like frozen dumplings you'd buy somewhere. They weren't bad, weren't great."}
{"text":"The baos I've had here are barely passable. I don't know if I just happened to turn up on an off day, but the filling was pretty meagre and the bao itself was so dry it actually crumbled. 

I didn't even finish it! I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately I was disappointed. 

I don't know why anyone would come here when bahn mi boys is so nearby. Not worth the money and didn't taste good at all :-("}
{"text":"Second time having mean bao and it was such a disappointment. I was expecting soft and fluffy bao but instead i got cold hard ones. It was around 6pm so i guess they didnt want to do more prep work. Meat was also way less than the first time. Upsetting..."}
{"text":"Always friendly staff, quick service and decently priced. Shrimp dumplings are a must at every visit!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place and decided to drop by for lunch. 
I had the braised beef and pulled pork bao. For ~$5 per baos after tax, I was a little underwhelmed. I definitely liked the pulled pork over the braised beef but it was still mediocre. The texture of the bun wasn't what I hoped it would be. Compared to Bahn Mi Boys and Momofuku, there's definitely better places to get baos in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food was good but the portions were small. My friend got a cold noodle salad that was really good but would have liked more topping. The service was great the staff was friend and we were served in a good amount of time"}
{"text":"It's awesome to see such a stand in a food court. Yes the bao might not be as good as Bahn Mi Baos, but it's still very good! Plus the dim sums taste really great! Especially the pork and shrimp dumplings."}
{"text":"This little shop serves up a few varieties of baos, including those for vegetarians. I was surprised to find that they served a bit of dim sum as well! Siu mai, ha gow, and pork dumplings can also be ordered here. It's a reallllly tiny place so be prepared to get take out and eat elsewhere.

I had the pork belly bao and the pork and shrimp dumplings. My friend ordered the same thing except with the siu mai instead. Here's a tip - get the siu mai instead of the dumplings. Tastes better and is bigger size-wise too!

Pork belly bao was ok. I wasn't blown away by it. I guess it's since I'm Asian and realized I can most likely recreate this bao no problemo at home. Heck, I don't think I should even tell my parents I ate this cause I can just imagine the look of disappointment of spending $10 on a bao and a couple of dumplings. Sure - it's not very pricy, but for asian standards, it's slightly above what you're used to paying.

Overall, nothing amazing here folks but great to grab a quick and cheap bite for lunch that's outside of your normal soup and sandwiches. Also a good option after a night at the bar too!

Baos are cool and all but I think I'm more of a bahn mi girl at the end of the day."}
{"text":"2.5-3 stars
Oooo I was kinda hopeful with this one. Maybe I will be back, not sure yet.
I had the Pork belly Bao and Shrimp dumplings. 
So the sauces are all on the side but I didnt realize there were hardly any sauces or flavor in the actual bao and dumplings! It maybe just the type of bao I had...
As far as the shrimp dumpling - its just that, dumpling wrapper and plain cooked shrimp. No additional flavorings inside it, not even sesame oil, garlic? nada.
I did get the sauce on the side which had all that and dipped it in there but still, unfortunately Ive had better. The bao, as pretty as it looked, tasted also pretty plain. 
Its a great place, not much seating but I like the decor, rustic wood tables and metal chairs. I like the garage window. The front window has a moisture issue - the steam from the kitchen and the cold outside builds a pool of water on the ledge (not a reflection of the food I know, but it would be nice if this were fixed as I do like the cute place). 
Anyhow - over all its ok if you want a quickish bite to eat for a moderate price. 
Given all the great reviews, this may just be an off day for them. If I come back I'll try out the other baos."}
{"text":"Came here for a casual weekend dinner. Order and pay at the front and then they'll bring you your order. They sell both baos and dimsum here, but I only went with the baos. 

Curry chicken bao was decent. It's an interesting fusion, but I wouldn't say I'd order it again. It was part of their special menu. 
Highlight was the braised beef bao, which I highly recommend ordering. Braised beef with the Taiwanese pickle went really well together.  

They are fairly sizeable baos, but I feel like I can keep on eating them."}
{"text":"I usually go for beef braised Bao. It is the place that I always order when i have classes on those days. I like the mix with kinda Chinese and Western receipts for the baos.

But i don't really appreciate the shrimp dim sum because it was not as fresh as the baos, and not soft enough for a dim sum dish."}
{"text":"Mean Bao screwed up my lunch order. I asked for shrimp dumplings and a medium spicy pork bun. I got a very spicy pork bun and a sloppy Joe, this was my friend's order... but instead of mixing us up, they just doubled his so we both ate his order. 

At first, I was very annoyed (don't fuck with my lunch, etc.), but I'm over it. Why am I over it? It was very, very tasty! An excellent cheap ($16 for two) take-out lunch option on Bathurst S of Queen."}
{"text":"A delightful lunchtime spot - after hearing so much about the pork belly bao at Momofuku and Banh Mi Boys, I wanted to try here.

This place is located in Village by the Grange, so seating is plentiful, and service is quick.

The bao were pillowy soft, and the pork belly absolutely melt-in-your-mouth, though I couldn't help but notice how sparsely they were packed. Another piece of meat, or at least a few more pickled vegetables would've helped make my meal a lot more filling. 

The combos are a pretty good deal - you can get two bao for $6.65, or a bao and one of their dim sum dishes for slightly more. I was actually quite impressed with the quality of their dim sum - it's presented in those traditional bamboo wicker baskets, and steamed hot on demand."}
{"text":"Cute little place by Queen/Bathurst. Came here for dinner and got their braised beef and pork belly bao. Overall, the food was only okay; I prefer Banh Mi Boys and their steamed bao. Mean Bao is forgettable to say the least."}
{"text":"I like it! The prices are cheap (about $3.50 per bun). I didn't eat the dim sum, I don't quite trust their dim sum quality.

However the buns (the bao's) are Chinese sweet buns (the white kind). Traditionally they are stuffed with BBQ pork, custard, or veggies and mushrooms. In this restaurant, they are used like a taco, stuffed with pork belly, chicken, or beef and salad. Also tofu, etc. Plus hot sauce on top.

They are tasty! 

It's a blend of VERY WESTERN stuffing
+ Chinese sweet buns

I mean for $7 two buns, it's not that bad! I ordered the ground beef and the chicken. Both were good. My very Chinese friend also agrees.

The place itself is super tiny, two half-tables and 4 stools. Usually customers order takeout and leave. No more than 10 skinny people can fit in there. Food is not fast, my baos took about 7 minutes total. They prepare them fresh and hot for you. I will happily return :)"}
