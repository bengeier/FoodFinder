{"text":"The interior is small with old school stools, tables and benches.  I visited during the week for lunch and enjoyed the souvlaki on a pita.  Both the waitress and cook made you feel at ease.  I noted most customers appeared to be regulars as they knew what to order and conversed among the staff."}
{"text":"Just got home from first time trying this restaurant and all I can say is WOW. Very small old school diner with the red counter stools and not many tables along the side.That's ok as I was early and not busy. Waitress very friendly  .  I had a Spanish Omelette with homefries toast and coffee. Coffee was hot and very good the Omelette was bang on amazing and filling.Home fries done well. A excellent breakfast all in all. Will I be back? in a heartbeat.Price was reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Has become a regular part of Sunday mornings as it's on the way to Church. Things tend to be a bit over cooked, so be specific about how you like it done. Staff always accommodating and attentive without hovering. Something for everyone. Friendly but some of the regulars tend to be noisy."}
