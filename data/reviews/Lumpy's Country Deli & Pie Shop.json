{"text":"Absolutely awesome food!  From breakfast, lunch, deli, to yummy sweets, they have it all and it's very, very good!  It's also all made within their shop from scratch!!"}
{"text":"One of the few things that I regret about moving to Florida is I only get to eat at Lumpy's when I'm visiting Pennsylvania.  Their custom made salads are one of my favorite lunches!  The first time I ate there I was looking at their selection and the woman who was taking care of me told me that they could custom make almost anything and that I didn't have to buy something pre-made and I had her make me exactly the salad that I wanted!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is HEAVEN!!!!  The food was superb, the prices were reasonable, and it's all homemade!  I had a BLT on marbled rye and broccoli salad...all fresh!!!!  I also had some potato and sausage soup which was perfectly seasoned and chunky!  They have a lot of changing special, so it's worth it to check in.  Certainly a hometown feel to this place.  Well done."}
