{"text":"My wife and I have driven by Flour many a time and we finally made our first visit this past weekend. I think from the \"Italian Kitchen\" part of its OpenTable name listing we expected something a bit more intimate, decorative and \"homey\" in feel ... which was not what we found (we were initially seated in the bar section of the restaurant with a number of glaring TV screens hanging overhead before we asked to be switched to the dining room section). But regardless, the menu listings were excellent and we were very satisfied with our selections - the chorizo stuffed dates and funghi pizza especially. Our server Aaron was great, so despite our initial surprise we did ultimately enjoy our dinner experience."}
{"text":"My family recently tried Flour for a second time. We tried it this past spring after it had just opened. It was very cold (spring time) and we were told they were working on the HVAC system. The place was sterile in decor and the food was average at best. Prices were high in relation to value received. Now we told ourselves we had to give it a second chance given opening woes that are typical with new restaurants (although given owners pedigree one could argue this point).   We went again Friday night. It was raining and cooler since it is October but we had hoped they had fixed the HVAC system. Unfortunately no. Still very drafty and cold. Thank goodness I brought a jacket. Other patrons were visibly cold as well. My daughter ordered the roasted chicken. The vegetables were notable but she commented we would have been better of roasting a chicken at home using Thomas Keller's recipe. My wife an I each ordered a pizza. They were good but certainly not better than Bar Cento downtown (possibly better than Noche in Chardon but that is debatable). Price is much higher than value received. Only offering Italian wines by the glass is disappointing (I realize this is an Italian restaurant but what happens if you hate Italian wines?). Overall just as disappointing as our visit in the spring and given all the other great choices at a much better value we will be passing on Flour from now on."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent.   The dates appetizer was fantastic.   The food had great flavors and just the right amount of spice.   It is not inexpensive,  but it is a very good meal."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant I have gone to in years. The salmon entree was inedible. The salmon, which was ordered medium, was the most dried out piece of fish I have ever seen, it was inedible! When I told the waitress, she just shrug her shoulders. The wedding soup was just as bad!! I can't believe how bad everything was. I think you would be better off at the Olive Garden, and that is not a complement!! Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and friendly service. The calamari was perfect. Their play on a carbonara was outstanding. We sat at the bar by the pizza oven and were so taken with the pizzas going in and out of the oven, we had to come back to try one of those. It was just as delicious as it looked. We will be back."}
{"text":"Always good, these guys are the pros. Great service complimented by exceptional food, and a great wine list. The pizza is thin crust perfection. The menu pizza is great or they will let you customize.i like to add an egg and capers to the sausage pizza. The Big meatball is super and fun to eat. It's a giant meatball in a nest of delectable creamed rocatta cheese. And for diner don't miss the tagliatella pasta dish, it's to die for. The entire dinner menu is wonderful. The also have $8 pizza night and half price wine night. All good."}
{"text":"The chorizo stuffed dates were not as good as I had hoped..a red sauce and chorizo that over powered the date itself...the bar area was quite loud and the bartender did not tell me about the specials before I ordered, had to hear from other customers...I think this place has promise but I did not enjoy my visit."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. The pizzas were great and the truffles for dessert are tastey. We had a large party during prime dinner time and felt somewhat neglected by our waitress for a little while. But once other parties cleared out we received more attention. Overall it was great and will be back!"}
{"text":"I debated between 3 an 4 stars on this one.  I had brunch on Valentines Day with my wife.  First, the Shrimp and grits was honestly one of the 10 best dishes I have ever eaten!  It was that good.  My wife enjoyed her veggie omelette, and the side of fruit was generous.  That said, the atmosphere was not enjoyable.  The tables are on top of each other so much so that you feel like you're in someone else's conversation.  I spent my brunch listening to two bitter women complain about everyone they had ever met.  The other issue is the massive closet in the middle of the restaurant.  They have some wine racks on one side of it, but it's just a massive closet in the middle of the dining room.  Strange.  So, on the whole.  Food:  exquisite  Atmosphere:  unpleasant  Service:  unremarkable"}
{"text":"With all due respect to all those who RAVE about this restaurant, I thought NOT. This afternoon, I visited it along with my wife and 4 other adults and 2 children. The reserved table did not have enough places and they promptly fixed that. The meals were terrible and the pizza was rustic and really not in good taste for all of us. Service was terrible too as my wife had to ask for more cream for her coffee 3 times before it came on the 4th. The waitress would bring something and then disappear :-( The buttered noodles were ok as was the gnocchi. My wife's eggs were undercooked and my friends pizza had a raw egg on it. The waitress says that this place is crowded every night. Well, my butte ached from sitting on the wooden chairs too long.  With all due respect, I was disrespected because with a party of 8, they automatically add the 20% to the bill.  For good pizza, for us, Jet in Mayfield Heights sells great chicago style deep dish and Costco has great New York style pizza. :-)"}
{"text":"Had a very good dinner last week. The bread and olive oil is a nice starter with a glass of wine. Local greens salad was very fresh, but just slightly over-dressed. I would order again with dressing on the side. And if you don't like scallions, ask for a difference dressing. We shared a pizza - nice light crust and delicious cheese + fresh basil delicious.  Splurged on a frozen banana ice cream treat - yummy!  All in all, very good - actually much better than our last visit a year ago. And, our server was terrific - fun and friendly and knowledgable!  Sorry I don't recall her name."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Best homemade pizza, great wine, service and parking. This place feels like home. My family meets here for lunch and dinner. The owners did a great Job and the chef is highly educated!"}
{"text":"Tagliatelle Bolognese is our favorite.  Practically a food group.  The lamb rigatoni also excellent.  The hanger steak was quite flavorful, but a bit salty.  One time at brunch, my wife ordered the side of fried chicken and had to return as it was all breading & bone with very little, if any, meat.  No problem...the waitress took it off our bill and quickly brought out a new meal.  Chorizo stuffed dates and salads are also fine.   Fantastic wine list and Tuesdays are great because of half-off wine under $100.    It can be a bit loud when busy and the decor is just OK.  Waitstaff is generally very eager to please and prompt.    All in all, one of our favorite places to go."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Flour so my 4 friends and I decided to try it for a girls night out. 2 of us ordered the pork chop special. It was rare when we ordered med. well, cold and so tough we couldn't cut it. We sent it back and got the linguini with clams which were tasteless. Their parmesan obviously came out of a green canister. One person had the wedding soup which had a strange herb or some bad flavor in it. Her pasta meal seemed  to come right out of a Chef Boy R Dee can. The pizza that was ordered wasn't good but the salmon meal was apparently very good. Waitress Kelly was very nice but we never were asked for drink refills and it took our food a long time to arrive. They gave us free ice cream and apologized but we will not return."}
{"text":"Call this a case of high expectations that weren't quite met.  (Let's just say my italian heritage is alive and well). And another case of half stars being useful, since I'd go 3.5 stars if I could.   The food was in fact very good -- we went for the pizza, which satisfied, but Crostata's it is not.  And service for the most part hit the mark -- prompt, kind, and knowledgable.  But disappointing were the opportunities that were missed that could have made it a great dining experience, especially for the price...(for example, our multiple attempts to customize dishes due to preference or limitations were either flat out refused or offered at a ridiculous upcharge).  Quality dining no doubt, but for this price point the alternatives in Cleveland would likely compel me elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and my husband and I had 2 drinks each at happy hour price. We were charged  regular price for the drinks. When we questioned the bill the server apologized.  He corrected the bill  but it was an $18 mistake plus tip and service charge. We were in the bar and it could have only been a happy hour price. I called the manager to tell him of this error and he argued with me. If we had not  caught the mistake it would have been a $25 error in favor of the restaurant. The manager was less than sympathetic and should have made some restitution but instead he kept arguing with me. We are done with Flour"}
{"text":"Flour is a good restaurant; almost as good as the people who work there think it is. I started at the bar and got lucky with the old guy bartender. He knew that a Manhattan is stirred, not shaken (so is a Martini, for that matter). The young guys, he told me on the side, would have shaken the ingredients into a foam. The waitress either didn't like me, or being a waitress, but she was efficient enough.We were seated in the less fashionable part of the restaurant, so I gave her the tip she so obviously expected. I have to give her credit, though, for knowing that the salmon was Faroe Island farmed, and she did a good job selling it. it was an undistinguished preparation, though, served over a bland mash of celeriac and under a sharp slaw of apple. We skipped dessert and got out for a fair price, but now that I have written this review, I'm certain I won't remember the meal."}
{"text":"While we always like to explore new and existing restaurants, Flour was recommended to us by a foodie friend that new we loved Italian cuisine. He was right. Flour has an innovative menu that took me back to Italy. Very approachable and not stuffy. Fresh, simple and prepared the way food should be. Honor the ingredients! Great wine list with some true notables for a wine collector like me. We will return many times to Flour as we will to Italy every year. Flour makes me homesick for Florence. Ve Benne!"}
{"text":"This place is top notch.  We booked a reservation but ended up sitting at the bar..because...well we like sitting at the bar.  The place is busy and loud but in an energetic kind of way.  Definitely better than a lot of the other snobby eastside restaurants.  The bartender did a good job.  The only minor issue was they didn't have Malbec.  Its 2012, who doesn't have Malbec.    Anyway, the mussels and clams appetizer was amazing.  The broth was good but the addition of housemade sausage was the game changer.  Also, a dish of mussels is only as good as the bread provided...Flour's bread is the best I've had.    For Dinner, ordered two dishes and split them.  We ordered the Porky Pie Pizza which was very very good.  The dough is probably the best in town.  We ordered the chicken cacciatore as well which was ok.  Nothing special.  There wasn't a whole lot of flavor and it was served way too hot.  The minor shortcoming can be overlooked because the rest of the meal was so f'ing good.    We will definitely be heading back."}
{"text":"I made my third visit to flour last week while on a business trip. I wish I lived closer!  The food is outstanding and the menu changes to reflect what is in season. On this past visit, I started with cured meat and cheese assortment. The cured cuatello practically melts on your tongue. It also had the best blue cheese I have ever had which was sourced locally in Ohio.   I had the baby artichoke salad which was delicious with aged provolone and just the right amount of lemon garlic dressing. The Caesar salad on my last visit was perfect. Something simple like a Caesar salad is a barometer I use to judge a restaurant.  My entree was pan seared walleye. Being from the midwest, I love walleye and perch in the summer. The walleye was cooked perfect with a delicious white bean ragout.  The snickers cake for dessert is a chocolate lovers dream.  The service is excellent at the bar with Erica and Ryan serving. The owners Paul and Lisa are very welcoming and have a loyal group of regulars.  I look forward to my next trip to Cleveland and I will be going to Flour."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but the food was a joke.  I swear, I bet the chefs are laughing their asses off when the TINY eggplant appetizer was served...tiny quarter-sized black discs of flavor-less yuck with a giant blob of \"whipped ricotta\"...and the stuffed squid was just as bad...big plate with 2 calamari and other junk on the plate...I was embarrassed because there were 3 of us...  I felt sorry for our server, because she had some real issues, but at $85 each, I didn't feel THAT bad!  My \"seared\" salmon was more than WELL DONE, my husband's \"clams and spaghetti\" was like dry angel air (NOT spaghetti) and a few shells and he told me, totally lacking of any kind of sauce, and my friend's ravioli with his requested red sauce was a plate full of bland pillows and a squirt of  sauce.  We never got bread until after we asked (well after the appetizer) and the bread was burnt and dry.  This is another attempt at Italian food  and this restaurant failed miserably!  I am so mad!!! DO NOT GO THERE!  It is an insult to those who want a great meal when you are ready to spend good money for it. I feel ripped off AGAIN!  I will not return and I wish our very sweet server would go elsewhere.  We gave her a good tip that she and the establishment did NOT deserve....  Never again."}
{"text":"I have been here for dinner and brunch. I came here on a first date, and we sat where we could watch the chefs cooking away. The ambiance was great, and so was the food. We split a pizza that was amazing. We finally came back for brunch, and it did not disappoint. Although it was crowded, the food made up for it. I had the oxtail potato hash, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. Most importantly, they have bottomless mimosas for a decent price. Patiently waiting to go back here and order the same exact thing."}
{"text":"Visited Flour for the first time on Friday May 31, met some girlfriends for a drink and had a good time.  I've passed this place many times and thought one day I'm going to stop well this was the day.  The atmosphere was good tho I didn't have any food just drinks its definitely a place I would like to try their food as I love pasta....so check em out when you get a moment to....I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"1. Great interior. High ceilings, I love the seafoam green tiled walls, good lighting, and tables are spaced far enough apart that you can freely converse about whatever inappropriate topic happens to emerge  2. Appetizers: The tartare was just 3 stars; there wasn't enough flavor.   3. Entree: I ordered the braised short rib, which was cooked perfectly tender with great flavor. My only suggestion would be that it needs more cowbell. I mean sauce. Just a tad more sauce would really take the cake. I also got a side of the brussel sprouts which were cooked in a creamy shallot sauce with pomegranate and pancetta. Tasty, but not mind blowing.  Others ordered the salmon which they claimed was delicious and the pork looked yummy too.   4. They let you order a bottle of wine and take home the rest in the recorked bottle. My table finished our bottle, but I can imagine how it could be convenient for a less thirsty crowd.   Overall, I'd definitely come here again! It's a restaurant I'd be willing to introduce to my parents."}
{"text":"Recently went to Flour with a large group of friends.  My wife ordered the swordfish special ($36), which came out raw.  The dish was sent back and came out a second time still raw.  I ordered the Osso Bucco which was a little tough and bland.  Needless to say we were very disappointed.  This is the first time we've been back to Flour since it first opened.  The menu selection and food quality was much better at that time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here for Sunday brunch! The food isn't cheap, but the quality is consistently high and everything appears so tasty! I've tried the salmon pastrami, eggs benedict, and breakfast pizza, as well as their different flavors of mimosas. Each time, I've enjoyed it thoroughly! The service has also been excellent! I am greatly looking forward to the next time I go there for Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"As a server myself, who dines out quite a bit I'm happy to say I found a place where I was thoroughly and genuinely happy with the service! My server, Anthony, and the bus crew were friendly and prompt.  I didn't give it 5 stars for 2 reasons, though...I didn't care for the beef carpaccio it was drenched in vinegar and had a huge amount of capers and bitter greens. I didn't complain because I was hungry. However, my salad was good. Then my entrée, the short rib was delicious, although the presentation did not look appetizing in the least. I enjoyed my Nutella Panna Cotta and cappuccino. I will come back. Also 1 more reason ....no specials ....come on chef...gotta have specials"}
{"text":"Was served undercooked salmon.  The waiter agreed the salmon was undercooked.  They took it back and refired it, but didn't make any adjustments to the check.  The TVs also detracted from the dining experience, something I would expect from a sports bar, not a fine dining restaurant charging $30+ per plate.  The service was also not prompt or attentive."}
{"text":"We stopped her for dinner last night. The place looks so pretty from the outside and was even prettier inside. We didn't have a reservation so the hostess showed us seating at what she called the chefs table. We thought it would be fun to sit there and watch them cook our food. That probably wasn't the best idea! First of all if you are going to have seating where diners can see their food being cooked then teach the cooks proper food handling procedures! I ordered a Caesar salad and I have to say that it was awesome! Big romaine leaves and crunchy croutons, it was so good. We each ordered a pizza because we were watching the guy make them and they looked amazing coming out of the oven. As we were half way through our pizzas the cook dropped his cleaning towel on the floor,picked it up and put it to the side. A few minutes later he grabbed the towel and wiped the counter. Ugh! We were done eating and we were finishing our drinks and watching the kitchen. The cook then washes his hands and grabs the same towel to dry his hands. Not only his hands but he dried his whole hairy arms with the towel....he ran the towel up and down his forearms. It was disgusting. If this is what they do in full view of the public then what happens behind the scenes?"}
{"text":"In a town with lots of authentic Italian restaurants located in a  neighborhood called Little Italy (and with an FBI history to match), opening an Italian eatery is always a challenge.  Flour, located in the eastern suburb of Moreland Hills does a fair job of meeting that challenge.  Here's our take.  We were about an hour early on our reservations and were told rather peremptorily by one of the hostesses that we wouldn't be seated until it was close to our reservation time.  We grabbed a couple of glasses of wine and sat in the rather comfortable chairs in the well apportioned waiting area - clearly the architect anticipated long waits for seating (probably because of the limited number of venues in the area).  After a few minutes - and checking on how bar tables were handled (again that rather ungracious \"it will be closer to your reservation time) we soon saw two seats open at the bar.  We sat and ordered from there.  The bar staff was professional, friendly and very attentive, even while making drinks for a steady stream of floor wait staff.  We ordered house green salads, which were large an well done.  My wife had a small spaghetti and clams and i ordered the veal.  The bread was ciabatta and delicious, the salads tasty and the entrees were very good.  Total bill with two glasses of wine each was over $110.  The salads alone were just under $10 each.  Other than the snooty atmosphere, the place was acceptable if loud, and the food was good if expensive.  With so many choices across Northeast Ohio, we probably won't return, but you never know."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had dinner at Flour midweek and can tell everyone that I was not disappointed at all.  From beginning till the end everything was wonderful.  Our server was very attentive and very helpful with menu suggestions and questions.    We started with the Bianca pizza and decided to add an egg.   I wasn't sure how I would like asparagus on a pizza; trust me it was not disappointing.  It was fresh, flavorful with a nice crisp.  At the same quality if not better in some ways than Bar Cento.  With the pizza we also spilt a small plate of the gnudi.  Once again it was phenomenal!!!  Soft fluffy in a wonderful sauce.  Portion size for a 1/2 serving was more than enough.  We both ordered an entree.  I tried the pork chop with polenta and brussel sprout slaw.  The chop was cooked perfectly, tender and moist.  The polenta was creamy and paired perfectly with the slaw.  She ordered the hanger steak with mashed potatoes and shitake mushroom.  The steak came in a little rare than she normally would like, but honestly we didn't ask how it was cooked.  The steak was flavorful and tender.  The potatoes were smooth creamy.  Again the whole plate paired very well.  The portion sizes matched the prices, no complaints about being too high.  I really wish I would have taken pictures to share.  I hope people disregard the previous bad post and give them a try.  Maybe they done some improvements since them but I can honestly say our experience at Flour was top notch.   I don't claim to be a blogger or a foodie, so please forgive my grammar, lol.  I'm just your average gut that enjoys good food and likes to share great my food experience for others."}
{"text":"Flour is very stylish with sleek new interior. The food is decent though it falls short of the setting. Rustic Italian is the aim though menu item are somewhat limited.  Service was consistently good.  Convenient location in a small stip mall in Moreland Hills. Plenty of parking, though I am a little perplexed by the Valet service."}
{"text":"Their tagliatelle was excellent and the local greens salad was awsome.  Their bread was a perfect artisan bread with a crispy exterior crust with a soft airy interior. After a 10 mile run this place did a great job in fulfilling the need for carbs."}
{"text":"Flour was simply shocking in its ineptitude. The calamari was passable, though pretty standard gfs-style \"rings\". The funghi pizza was good, but oily beyond belief.   The real kicker though was the tagliatelle bolognese. It tasted, I kid you not, exactly like beefaroni. Except that it came at nine times the price. I managed to choke down three bites. Once for the first impression, a second to confirm what I thought I tasted, and a third to let my wife \"taste this crap that tastes like chef boyardee\"  The fried olives were a revelation, though, so there's that.   We were $120 out the door, with two appetizers, two entrees and three drinks. We could have put the same meal together on a seven dollar trip to target, coupons notwithstanding. Stay away.  Oh, and I very nearly forgot, one of the hostesses was wearing what appeared to be a linen toga-and-diaper onesie. It's sounds odd, but that's truly what it looked like. Either way, her butt was hanging out, which didn't exactly lend zest to the canned pasta."}
{"text":"Loved the stuffed olives, shrimp brushetta, drinks and coffee. But my daughter and I had the spaghetti with clams, barely palatable. First we were told the clams were fairly large, they were tiny and tasteless. The onions, which were not mentioning in the description over powered the dish. The spaghetti was more like ramen noodles and the sauce was bland and very little of it. The staff was friendly and efficient. We have dined here several times and the food is hit and miss."}
{"text":"Flour is a delicious Italian restaurant. I went for brunch to do a review for my food blog you can check out the details at www.foodsofjane.com. Chef Mytro and Chef Minnillo are an amazing team and their menu has an Italian style + creative side."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and really nice dining room. Can bring babies and it's a loud place so don't have to worry if gets Loud. Pasta and pizza good. Chicken dish is Just ok - little bit dry. Great service. Really attentive high quality service."}
{"text":"Got to say that I was looking forward to eating here.  We had an 8 o'clock reservation last Saturday and when we arrived a bit early, and they sat us right away, which was very nice.  It took us about 15-20 minutes to get our initial drinks, server was nice, but not very attentive.  Apps arrived about 30 minutes in, dates with chorizo were pretty good, calamari was a bit underwhelming as described in previous reviews, but I thought it was pretty good.  Fried olives were a novelty, for $8, I would not order them again.  Dinner arrived about 1 hr in, I ordered the pork dish as they ran out of the lobster pasta apperantly, which is what I really wanted.  My wife ordered the bbq short rib special.  My pork dish arrived with 1/2 pork belly and the rest pork loin, I mention this because the pork belly was great, but the pork loin was cooked to shoe leather.  When the waiter came to ask if everything was ok, i told him about the pork loin and he quickly ran away mumbling something about telling the kitchen and getting me another one, mind you, everyone was already 1/2 way done with dinner.  My wife's dinner was also a bit puzzling, the reason she ordered it was that it came with Brussel sprouts and sun-chokes, I wish I would have taken a picture, it literally had 2 tiny sun-chokes and 2 brussel sprouts!!  When my wife asked for more vegetables, the waiter stated that they did not have enough for the rest of the orders, so he could not give her anymore.  The server never came back to give my another pork loin, or to apologize for the dish, he just presented us with the check (with no discount).  For $70/per person plus tip, this was not a very good experience, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Prices are fairly premium. The decor is much like an upscale sports bar. But the food was very disappointing. I had wedding soup that tasted like it was made with beef boullion and did not have anything but meatballs (i.e. Where is the \"wedding\"?). My main dish was a terribly bland roasted chicken. The fennel garnish was good and Original. My dessert was a \"house specialty\" pumpkin cream parfait that was not enjoyable and had the \"fake whipped cream\" taste you'd expect in bargain buffets. In all it was really disappointing, especially for the price.   On the good side the presentation is excellent and my friends' dishes looked good. One had a salmon dish and the other some beef dish. They liked their dishes. In addition my chicken was huge, so if you want half a chicken to yourself, well here you go. But just don't expect much in the way of flavor."}
{"text":"Just moved to Cleveland from New York City and I was so happy to have found Flour!  My family is from Southern Italy and it is really hard to find good italian style pizza, but then I found Flour.  I would put it up against the best pizza places in New York, the wood-burning oven truly gives it the authentic italian pizza margarita flavor and I love it. Ok, enough about the pizza- the other dishes that my family loved was the pasta bolognese, the burrata, and the pork chop. Also to make the experience even better- we found ourselves there on a Tuesday which means that all wine bottles under $100 is 50% off! I really recommend Flour and I hope it stays open for a really long time."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food and service the best. The owners always make sure everything is great. The wine list can't be beat, whatever your price range."}
{"text":"Love Flour!  I'm vegan and although there is basically nothing on their menu for me, they always accommodate me.  I basically ask the server to tell the chef to make me anything vegan (exept pizza or pasta or anything with lots of oil) and the chef whips me up something awesome each time.  I DO wish they'd actually ADD some of these incredible dishes they've whipped up for me to their menu because they'd attract so many healthy eaters and can show off versatility.  Love the atmosphere.  Servers are always really nice and attentive.  Love the \"scene\" that is usually there ....  I do enjoy eating there frequently."}
{"text":"So wanted to like this restaurant more than I did.   Decor is great; food not so much. Our server was having a bad day too although I'm going to him a pass and not take off a star.   The main disappointment was the fried chicken. Too much \"coating\" that was incredibly salty and chicken that was barely included. A good sauce couldn't mask the lack of actual food in the portion. Scrambled eggs were watery and unseasoned. Potatoes were generic. Overall didn't get the rustic nature of the kitchen."}
{"text":"We've been on the hunt for wood-fired stone oven pizza. Flour has been in our sites for a while. Today we finally got here for lunch.   We ordered a Margarita and a sausage with mushrooms. The pizza is definable wood fired in a stone oven. Unfortunately the crust is flavorless. I realize it's difficult to make fresh, flavorful crust every day but no topping is going to improve a bland crust.   The crushed tomatoes sauce and fresh mozerell a we're good as was the sausage and mushrooms. There was too much parmesan cheese so the mozzarella  flavor was drowned out.   Service was ok but not outstanding. Overall a disappointing experience. The hunt goes on."}
{"text":"Just OK. Many better restaurants in the area - skip this one unless you're in a bind. Service and food quality were just average."}
{"text":"I was expecting good things judging from all the positive comments.  First, this is a nice place.  They have 'free valet' which I'm not a fan of.  The valet guy had a great demeanor and was pleasant.  When I got in I was promptly greeted and asked to sit at the bar.  There was one spot.  Great!  That's when the experience went down hill.  This place is LOUD.  I mean really LOUD.  I can handle loud.  This place is evidently the new date market for women - the screaming and cackling was ear splitting - no joke.  I'm not putting anyone down but it was downright obnoxious.  I ordered a delicious chianti to start.  It was the only one on their 'by the glass' menu and I highly recommend it.  I took a look at the menu and was surprised by 2 things.  The lack of italian options.  The 'weirdness' or 'cuteness' of some of the dishes they had.  The bread was fresh - but wasn't the classic Italian I'd expect from a place called Flour.  I ordered the Big a$$ meatball.  That was delicious and worth the $11 they charge.  Not finding much with red sauce for pasta dishes I ordered the lasagna since I was in a red sauce mood.  That was so-so.  It had potential to be great, but it wasn't hot and the ends were overcooked (and I like my edges crispy).  Further, they put sausage in it - which is OK by me - but this particular sausage had a strange flavor.  The bartenders were competent but slow - I wasn't the only one who thought so, a couple of other patrons were flagging them down - they had 2 bartenders and a dedicated barback.  No good excuse to keep people waiting.  Normally I would have stayed for another glass of wine and some dessert.  However, between the noise and the old couple that sat down next to me in the middle of my meal, I just had to call it quits.  Her perfume was classic old lady perfume and she had too much of it on.  I could just about taste it when I took a bite of food.  So the short of it is this - I'm not sure I'll return.  Between the noise (my ears are still ringing loudly), the relatively slow service,  the not quite right lasagna and the myriad of other options for restaurants, this restaurant is back-burnered."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times. It's always loud and busy. It's very difficult to have a conversation when dining here. Their pasta is good but portion is okay. Pizza sometimes are good, sometimes not. I think their price is a bit too high considering the portion and quality. I would come back again if friends want to come,  but it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Update 7/6/12- I've been a few times since my original review and each visit has been wonderful. Today we stopped for lunch. It is our new favorite lunch spot in this area.   The salmon salad sandwich was unique and fresh. Delicious summer option. My husband had the short rib panini again. He loves it!  I'm dying to go back for dinner to get the pizza. Soooo amazing. I think this place is actually getting better as time goes on.   Original review- Delicious!  I had the pleasure of dining at Flour this week and it was truly a pleasure.   The service was great without being too much. My friend and I started with the shrimp bruschetta and the eggplant bruschetta. Both were delicious and easily shareable. Next up was the bolognese and the duck pasta. Both were great, but the duck was amazing. I will definitely get that again on my next visit. Did I mention that it came with a crispy piece of duck skin?  I typiWe then had the scallops which were perfectly cooked. Oh, and the drink menu was fun too.   We asked for the items to be brought in courses. The pastas came before we finished the apps and the runner offered to take them back and make fresh when we were ready. We didn't think that was necessary, but wow, that was a nice offer.   The place was packed on a Wednesday evening and I can see why. I typically don't love restaurants in the suburbs, but this was great. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop at Flour for dinner on our way back from visiting our daughter's family in Northern Virginia, ( a 6 hour drive).  We ordered some cocktails and the ordered our dinners.  I ordered an appetizer of PEI Mussels which was prepared with sausage, brodo, pickled fennel, and flatbread in a white wine and cheese sauce.   It was just phenomenal.  I have never had Prince Edward Island mussels prepared this way and we just loved it.  The pickled Fennel was just an excellent choice, along with finely ground sausage.  The sauce was memorizing.  Dunking the flatbread in it just added to the flavor explosion that was going on in our mouths.  This was an appetizer that was enough for my wife and I for a complete dinner. We also ordered a pepperoni pizza (10\") that unfortunately we had to take home, because we were both stuffed.  I will have to let you know later how the pizza was.  We each sampled one piece of the pepperoni from the pizza and it was very flavorful and tasty.  I can't wait to taste the pizza.  Our server was Cameron and she took really good care of us.  She checked on us often and made sure we had every thing we needed.  She is a great credit to Flour, as she made our dinning experience very relaxing, like we were dining at a friend's  house.  Kudos to her.  I unfortunately did not take any pictures, as I was spent from the long drive.   If you want unusual and very tasty dishes, go to Flour."}
{"text":"I'm an Italian Affecianado. I absolutely love the cuisine. And if you can actually make it authentic.... mmm...  Flour is essentially exactly what it claims to be - a Rustic Italian Kitchen. Expect an upscale restaurant serving some of the tastiest Italian food (with a Sicilian bend) you have eaten!  Started the evening with a Classic Martini ($9.50) and Arancini ($9).  The bar at this place is actually pretty good! One of the few places I've been to that get the Vermouth to Gin ratio right...   But the Hero of this palce is the food... Let's talk about the Arancini. Arancini, for the unacquainted, are these little fried balls of cheese and rice. Simple you say - but to perfect them is a tough task. You've got to flavor them right, make sure they are crispy on the outside, but the rice and cheese is perfectly melty and gooey on the inside, and that the flavor shines. And this place delivers. The only place I've had better is in Sicily itself.   For the main course we ordered the Pasta Cavetelli and a Sweet Potato Gnocci. One thing I love about this place is that it serves you small plates if you would like ($12-$14 each), which, honestly, are the perfect size for a meal (unless you haven't eaten all day). The cavetelli was heavenly and the sweet potato gnocci was delicious!  The only reason this place gets a 4 star review is their gnocci - just a wee bit overcooked.   Also service - this place is a place that the art of good waiting has been remembered and passed down. A good wait service is never intrusive but always there. They don't bother your meal every 5 minutes with a \"how are you doing\", or a \"can I fill your glass with more water?\". Very simply, your water glass never goes empty, plates are whisked away when you're done, cutlery is bought out when you need it, and there is a person by your side within a couple of seconds if you turn and look for them. Perfect.   There is a reason this place is one of Iron Chef Micheal Simon's favourite restaurants! Go to Flour and you will not be disappointed! I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"We, 3 couples, went late; for drinks and small plates.  They stopped serving from the main menu a bit early, so we were disappointed there.  The bartender knows what he's doing.  My Old Fashion was as good an execution on that classic as I've had.  I could taste all the flavors, a great job on the bitters, and nicely muddled fruit.  Give it a try.  Rest of the group had Hendricks Martini, and BeliniTini.  They were all good but totally over priced.  They should think about that.  Small plates were very good.  We had the peppers and olives, both good, nice quantity and fairly priced.  We were happy.  Bathrooms are very nice and very clean, but you'd expect that since they have not been open very long, but nice job anyway.  I know where to get my next Old Fashion; go there and give it a try.  I will also need to try dinner too.  The menu prices looked stoked, but I'll let you know later."}
{"text":"East side gem! Fantastic dishes, albeit from limited menu. Every dish is excellent. Outstanding wine collection. Great vibe, energy and value."}
{"text":"One of the best calamari I've ever had. Sockeye salmon was also very delicious."}
{"text":"A year later, and Flour still rocks it!   Love the Stozzapretti, the Faroe Salmon, and the Vermentino. The cheese & meat platter is great to start or finish. Enjoy !!  2018: Go for the French Chardonnay (Pouilly Fuissé)"}
{"text":"Soup and salad for lunch. How do you screw that up? Well the soups were so salty they all tasted the same. The beans were still crunchy like they had thrown some more into the pot that morning.   Salads were small and over dressed and not tasty. No cocktails and it was still 20 dollars a person. Should have gone to Panera!"}
{"text":"I visited Flour for the first time with a group of friends. One of the people in my party was celebrating his birthday and the food at Flour not only looked amazing in the pics I saw online but the reviews raved about it.   I made a reservation for 8:30pm through OpenTable. We had planned to go out for drinks after dinner so I figured this would be the perfect time. We arrived 30 minutes early and planned to sit at the bar while we waited for a table. The place was packed and the bar area wasn't very big. It was Saturday night and the fact that it was so busy, in my mind, was a good sign. No worries. We ordered wine and sat patiently.  The dining area is very modern, open, inviting, but a bit too loud. We were constantly shouting in order to communicate with one another. The place has an upscale vibe but the atmosphere is very relaxed with patrons wearing anything from jeans and a button-down shirt to the occasional blazer.   As we waited, I inquired a few times about our table and was told it wouldn't be much longer. A few minutes after our reservation time had passed, one of the hostesses, who wasn't very friendly (a smile goes a long way in the client-facing industry), asked if we would be okay with a high-top table as a regular table would take another 20 minutes. We discussed and agreed to take it, even though it wasn't our first choice. As we sat down, we could see a regular table was empty and we asked about it. The hostess said she could accommodate us there only to come back a few minutes later and say that she had spoken too soon.   Another party of 4 that had walked in at about 8:25pm was being seated at that table (all 4 in their party hadn't gotten there until maybe 8:35 or so). It was now 8:45. When we asked why a party that had walked in way after us was getting that table, we were told they had a reservation for 8pm. They were over 30 minutes late, yet the hosts kept the reservation and were seating them before a group that had been waiting for almost an hour at this point.  We asked to speak to the manager, Mike Riley, and explained the situation. He was very polite and said he would do his best to find us a table as soon as possible, but I did not feel he used the experience appropriately to educate his staff. It was more like \"let me see what I can do to get these people out of my hair.\" Fifteen minutes later, we were seated.   Service was slow but the server was very nice. The restaurant was very busy so that's understandable. One of servers poured too much wine into one of my friend's glass from a bottle we had already purchased while we waited for our table and proceeded to pour it out of his glass into another glass--not exactly what you might expect at a nice restaurant. We ordered appetizers that took longer than 15 minutes to arrive, but were delicious. The pizza was very good and the pasta dishes were amazing!  All in all, a good dinner, save for the inability of the hosts to properly handle reservations fairly and how extremely busy and loud the place was. I would have given it 4 stars otherwise. Unfortunately, 2 stars is more than generous considering how badly they screwed up our reservation. I would give them another try, but maybe not on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Mussels & clams with chorizon in a broth to die for! Service was enthusiastic but slow, probably because the place was packed on a weeknight. Also noisy. But well worth coming back."}
{"text":"We went there when they first opened, so I'm not sure this review will count or not.  But, the portions were really SMALL... Prices high and they needed some ambiance.  I won't go back, but things might have changed."}
{"text":"The three of us went for dinner on a Saturday night. I would say overall our experience was good. Service was excellent from Catie.  The food is a solid 3.5 stars.  The bucatini carbonara was slightly underdone.  Good flavor, though, but not close tot he carbonara at Dante.  That stuff is boss.  The pizzas were very good especially the pepperoni with the Grana Padano cheese (skip the Margerita...too bland) but I think a pizza from Citizen Pie is better. Bread brought to the table was super good.  I love to see Italian places that make their own pasta in-house so two thumbs up for that.  The Caesar salad dressing had heavy notes of Dijon to me.  Tasty dressing, but not what you would expect from a classic Caesar dressing.  Respectable wine list."}
{"text":"In the past this was an extremely AVERAGE maybe even below average restaurant.  Not sure if they've upped their game since then."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere and the service was great. I do feel like their food can be on the pricey side. I had a salad that barely had enough dressing. I tend to eat less dressing anyway, but this wasn't even enough for me. I also had their margherita pizza and it was good, definitely fresh. Overall, I will go back to try it again, but I think I will get something different."}
{"text":"We probably eat here at least 2-3 times/month and it's consistently great! We typically start with either a Caesar salad or the garden salad, followed by the pasta bolognese, sausage pizza, and mushroom truffle pizza (substitute mozzarella cheese for goat cheese). The best thing on the menu is the brisket sandwich (its only available for brunch and is seasonal). Family friendly and also a local fun spot for drinks!"}
{"text":"Decent food - yet very over-priced. Service was fine, atmosphere a bit \"stuffy\" and felt like an old shoe in the middle of a country club.  Our meal was good - but not worth the high prices.  Just my (and my husband's ) opinion.  My husband just reminded me to add that the portions were VERY generous!!  We are not likely to go again - for the prices, we have other favorites in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We should have read the reviews before coming. The prices were too high for the quality of food. The wait for service when there were few people in the restaurant was a tad lengthy. Wine and Sangria prices were WAY over priced. Try Degaetanos in Beachwood instead! Cheaper, larger portion, friendlier and prompt wait staff."}
{"text":"I thought the service was really good here. We got s few apps to start - the octopus was really good! They have a large app menu. We also tried a side of the meatless meatballs- not the same texture are the meat version but tasty and different! I got the lasagna for my main meal but I wasn't entirely impressed. We actually had someone say the airline chicken was good where past reviews I know people did not like it.   Good spot for a date or even cocktails and apps for happy hour . Was pretty packed so I would suggest reservation if possible ."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and was very pleased. I had a Caesar salad and cauliflower soup. Very nice atmosphere and good service. I would like to go back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"It takes a really good restaurant for us to bother going out to the outer suburbs but Flour is right at the top of the list. The wait staff is professional yet personable while the ambiance is more formal than relaxing. Jeannene and I each wen with the orange fennel old-fashioned cocktail, which is a nice spin on a classic as it uses honey to give it the sweetness. We then went with the beef carpaccio ($13) for the appetizer. There was as much shaved reggiano as beef, which I'm not saying is a bad thing. And there was a large mound of lfresh greens on top of that, adding some vibrancy. At one point I got a hit of black pepper and I wish there was a little bit more of that. For main courses, we both went with that night's specials though the pastas looked very inviting. I had the bread fluke while Jeannene had the short ribs (both $29). I had only previously had fluke as sushi and found it very blah but I was very impressed with this cooked version. The skin on one side was extremely crispy while the other side had a crispy panko bread crumb crust and in between was a thick, fleshy fish. It came on a bed of creamy fregula which had a subtle green pepper taste to it and some pickeled shaved veggies to counter the thick, breaded fish and cheezy pasta. Jeannene's short ribs were OK enough, but the star of her plate was the smoked mashed potatoes. For dessert we split a pumpkin pie budino ($8), which is a pudding dish served in a glass. And it was amazing -- it tasted just like the fall classic dessert only in the form of a thick pudding. I was really regretting I had to share it."}
{"text":"Flour hits another homerun on a busy Saturday night, Sweetest day. The CAB Strip Steak/Alaskan King Crab special was phenomenal, truly epic. We also enjoyed an order of eggplant meatballs and their homemade pasta Bolognese. The new Fall menu is innovative and the Pumpkin Budino dessert is not to be missed. Always the best, fabulous!"}
{"text":"We were greeted with the smell of freshly baked pizza dough as soon as we walked through the door. We stopped in for Sunday brunch and we were fortunate to have made a reservation as it was very busy. The staff was friendly and the food was excellent. We look forward to seeing what this restaurant has to offer for dinner on a future visit."}
{"text":"To celebrate Cleveland Independents Restaurant week, three girlfriends and I decided to venture to the east side for a change.  After scoping out the three course prix fixe menus online, we chose Flour.  To summarize our dinner: disappointed.  The goat cheese stuffed olives were okay to start and we figured there would be better courses to come.  I was excited to try the butternut squash risotto with fried brussel sprouts on top.  I never thought I'd say this about risotto, but it had no flavor.  I added salt and pepper to try to save a failing dish.  Two of my dinner companions ordered the salmon and they were pleased with it.    Lastly, the traditional panna cotta was terrible - also severely lacking flavor.  The popcorn nutella ice cream bar was rich, but I couldn't detect the popcorn or nutella flavor under the thick layer of chocolate that seemed to overpower the dish.  All in all, we won't be back.  I think I'll stick to the west side and downtown for future restaurant weeks."}
{"text":"Abosutly amazing restaurant.The food and service is always phenomenal. You must try the funghi pizza!!!!! A must try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Flour was a great one. The ambiance is great bc it's not the norm in Cleveland. It's fresh, new and appealing. The food was fantastic. Had the calamari and beef carpaccio as an app, both were great. Calamari was lighted dusted and fried, not all breading like so many others. 3 of us had the New York strip special, covered in peppercorns asparagus and loaded fingerling potatoes....absolutely delicious. 1 had the scallops which looked amazing as well. Topped the night off with a \"Canadian breakfast\" for desert. Overall, had a great night, food was wonderful and am looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many many times however this was the first time I had ordered the salmon w sunflower seed risotto. Over the moon amazing! Prepared to perfection. By far the best salmon I have had in years and I eat out often! This is an awesome foodie experience, from mussels to pizza to dates!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Food is amazing and the decor is fresh and open (but be careful on the floor if you're wearing heels).  The staff was also extremely fun and very good at describing the food.  I have never enjoyed brussel sprouts before; get the brussel sprouts!"}
{"text":"We waited with great anticipation for the opening of Flour, which was often touted as a \"reasonably-priced\" alternative to authentic Italian food and wines.  My husband and I waited well over a month after their \"grand opening\" before visiting Flour to allow for any bugs to be worked out.  We figured one month was plenty of time for someone already well-seasoned in the business.  The wine list is extensive with many good Italian wines sold by the glass as well as by the bottle.  The food, as to be expected, is fresh and beautifully presented.  The service is adequate.    My one (huge) gripe is the price of most items on the menu compared to the portions.  In my opinion (and my husband and I eat out quite a bit at good, highly-rated restaurants).  When you spend well over $100 for a few drinks and appetizers for 3 people and still feel hungry, something is amiss.  In this economy and with so many excellent choices of restaurants in the Cleveland area, I do not know how a restaurant can survive with over-priced stingy portions, regardless of how unique the food is.  There are many fine restaurants in the area that offer excellent food, good wine, and good service without the absurd prices.  And the decor at Flour seems very cold and loud.  Not an atmosphere condusive to enjoying a fine glass of wine, in my opinion.     As for the pizza and the long-awaited pizza oven from Italy....just \"OK.\"  Six small pieces for $15 would make even the best of pizza go down with a bad taste.  Crostata's in Highland Hts. along with many other places in the area offer great pizza at half the price or twice the size.  We will give Flour one more chance to check out their patio, but based on our very first experience there.....a real let down."}
{"text":"Monday night is half price pizza night!  We have been there a few times and decided to go on Monday for the pizza special.  The décor is classy.  High ceilings,  Good space between tables. The service was excellent.   The food was excellent.  Peppers stuffed with home made sausage for appetizer, Caesar salad and pizza for the main course.  The stuffed peppers were exactly as the waitress described, moderately spiced and delicious.  The pizzas were also excellent.  Thin crusts, great toppings.  What is there to not like?  Price for the two of us at a high end restaurant were moderate, making this a great Monday night out!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened. Awesome Owners and staff Eric and Britney are fabulous bar tenders. Everyone is so nice and so accommodating. They somehow manage to always get my insane takeout everything special lunch orders right all the time. Great pizzas and great marinara. They bake their focaccia!! Fresh daily!!! Great place for vegetarians and they will do vegan and gluten free !"}
{"text":"Love this place the Tagletelli  is the best in Cleve ... Home, from and with Bolognese ... However not the same eating out on a Friday night without my lady ..."}
{"text":"Flour  For weekly Reviews like Cleveland Bites on Facebook!  Friday night is date night! Not much of an Italian restaurant fan because after working in one as a teenager I feel most food I get there I can cook at home. When I go out I'm looking for food that is difficult for me to recreate myself. That being said I was intrigued after @Eatdrinkcle recommended this place to me while looking for a good spot to head to Chagrin Falls for reasons that will soon become apparent! ;) We came at 7:30 on a Friday night with no reservation and were seated immediately. They also offer a free valet service despite the parking lot being rather slow, but parking ourselves we did notice how full it was at this early time. The atmosphere had a modern vibe that still felt classy and not too industrial. Still a lot of wood and fabric was replaced by steel and concrete. Very contemporary! The mood was exciting most of it stemming from the open kitchen concept which is becoming a huge fad and I'm a fan. We were seated right beside the work area and while not overly loud it provided a certain electricity to the ambiance. They do offer an area apart from the main dining area of you prefer a more intimate seating. Now on to the menu! I was really in love with the menu; how it was broken down, how it was laid out, the options being various and not overwhelming. Very clean concise and inventive options. They offer a full bar and boast an enormous wine list for any price range, but non alcoholic options are limited severely.  We settled on giving this place the full gambit. Two appetizers were ordered the 'Big A$$ Meatball' (large meatball, whipped ricotta, and provolone, in Italian sauce) and the 'Fried Olives' (Green olives, stuffed with goat cheese and fried). We were started with some focaccia bread which was decent and a nice beginning to the experience, but the apps arrived fast and they were both fantastic dishes. The olives were great. The saltiness of the olives with the smooth creaminess of the cheese paired well and frying them didn't make it a heavy dish. The meatball really stole the show especially for my wife (she had never had ricotta before?!?!). It was large and well made and seasoned, but paired with the creamy ricotta and thick tomato sauce took the dish to a new level. Put us in the right mood for everything else. For entrees we spit a 'Wood Fire Pepperoni and Sausage Pizza' and 'Semolina and Mushroom Gnocchi' also getting a side of 'Truffled Tots'. The tots were fine. They were good and tasty and the garlic aioli to dip them in made them better. The pizza was hot and delicious! They imported the pizza oven and bring over the flour and other ingredients directly from Italy for the most authentic neapolitan recipe they can. I really enjoyed it but I need to make sure anyone is prepared when ordering this. Not typical pizza. My wife picked up a slice and all the toppings and cheese came spilling off of it. I folded mine and still the limp center drooped heavy. It either a two hand or fork and knife dish to be honest. They are on point with the execution, but a lot of people might not get what they expect. Best for last! Oh my god the pasta was amazing. The gnocchi wasn't too dense or potato-y, but held up against the thick gravy like sauce wonderfully. The oxtail and big chunks of mushroom were also so incredibly well done. Pasta is star here and I approve this message! We unfortunately had to exempt ourselves from dessert for reasons that will become apparent soon, but are eager to return to check that box as well! As a final shoutout I want to say how extremely wonderful our waitress was. Knowledgable and enthusiastic about the product she was selling. I was very happy and despite a bustling Friday night crowd felt very well taken care of. Flour gets a high recommendation from me. Meal for 2 with water, two appetizers, two entrees, and a side dish was $78.  Atmosphere -  Price -               Quality -           Taste -              Service -           Good Points - Terrific service - Pasta made fresh and in house - Fantastic original menu options  Bad Points - Not your grandpas Italian restaurant. If you want that Lady in the Tramp vibe you might want to go somewhere else. - Price on pasta is high so be prepared to pay $25-$30 an entree. Worth it, but pricey."}
{"text":"Awesome, and I am a foodie.  You want to try the wedding soup and any of the Pizza's.  The brunch is fantastic!  Great for lunch, brunch or dinner.  Try any of the pastas as well!  Get a reservation for the weekend......................."}
{"text":"Friday I was on a date with my girls. Trying to find somewhere in between all involved we opted to try Flour. And we weren't disappointed.   I Open Table'd our reservation earlier that day. We were all fashionably tardy by 5 min yet we were welcomed by the hostess and taken straight to our table. From there on I think we may have talked to almost everyone working there. You will never find yourself waiting for someone to take your order or re-fill your water. Apparently there is a \"team\" for every aspect of your dining experience to make it seem effortless (I'm guessing...).  We started with a bottle of red wine off the endless wine list. Our waitress was exceptionally knowledgeable and was able to answer our questions. I love it when this happens.   Apps. Beef Carpaccio which my friend raved about it. Pumpkin Risotto was amazing and a large portion. The Romaine Salad with Caesar dressing was also share worthy and delicious. Then we (3) split a Margherita Pizza. Six slices was the perfect amount.   We added on another bottle of wine and sat and talked until we were almost the last group there. No one rushed us and everyone was great.  Highly recommend for a girls night or date night."}
{"text":"flour is a bright, bustling restaurant serving up rustic italian fare in a contemporary setting just outside cleveland.   everything is housemade, from the antipasti to the pasta. i checked out this spot with some clients, and most opted for the seasonal special - the copper river salmon. but i had to try their homemade pasta, and was so glad i did. their cavatappi with pork ragu, lucky penny goat cheese, and english peas was truly tasty, and the dinner portion is enormous!  i hear that this is an unlucky strip, but i think flour is here to stay!"}
{"text":"A bougie brunch experience! A friend and I came for Sunday morning brunch with a reservation, but found it wasn't needed - there were plenty of open tables even though the unusually sunny winter day lit up the restaurant perfectly (dem floor to ceiling windows tho). Flour's interior is picturesque, just posh enough where you could take a business partner or date you want to impress, but not to the point where they think you might be trying to hard.  Our waiter was very patient and polite as we went through the menu two, three, four times trying to pick out the best formula of a list of scrumptious-sounding items. Mimosas were a given - Pomegranate and Grapefruit - and we settled on the Flat Bread Panini, Shagbark Spelt and Pumpkin Pancakes (pumpkin is never out of season), and a side of the Brussels Sprout Hash. Everything was freaking delicious! The pancakes tasted like pumpkin cider with a bit of crunch, and the panini was like a healthy breakfast rolled into a convenient burrito. Even in our side dish, usually an afterthought, the brussels sprouts shone with just the right crunch and I could have eaten that pancetta for days.   For such a nice place, the price tag is fairly modest, although certainly no Mickey D's. I was left feeling like I needed just a little more food on each plate, but I guess that's also a compliment to the chef for keeping my appetite's attention. I've heard that at night Flour's vibe transforms into a different beast - maybe both will float your boat!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch!  After reading reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I knew that I had to visit Flour for Brunch.  I was not disappointed!  I made a reservation through Open Table and met a friend at 11:00.  The restaurant was sufficiently full.  We were seated right away and proceed to peruse the menu.  I knew immediately that I wanted to try the fried farro, I also ordered a side of fruit and sourdough toast.  My friend ordered the sausage pizza.  Our food arrived a short time later.  I added shrimp to my farro for an additional $5, not worth it, only received 2 ok sized shrimp.  I won't bother adding shrimp the next time.  The farro, was DELICIOUS!  Imagine the Italian equivalent of Asian fried rice.  The farro was seasoned perfectly, contained sautéed mushrooms and other veggies, and was topped with a perfectly poached egg.  The portion was perfect.  My dining companion enjoyed her pizza, as well.  Taking a look at the dishes being delivered around me, everything looked really tasty.  At the end of our meal the server brought over to homemade oatmeal cookies......perfect finish.  I will absolutely return to Flour, can't wait to try lunch, dinner and Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"What a delicious and delightful brunch on a chilly Sunday morning.  The four of us split the Loaded Tater Tots (oh my god.... CRAZY good.) My friend, who had been before, told us that many of the \"Take Sides\" were more like full portions. I ordered the Fried Farro bowl, which may be one of my favorite breakfasts i've had in a while. It was savory, packed with flavor and veggies. I loved the creamy poached egg on top of the beautiful texture of the farro.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes, although the Nutella French Toast was REALLY sweet.   Service was decent, but kind of awkward. Our server was in training, and the woman she was in training under kept checking in with us, instead of our server.   I will be dreaming about that farro bowl, though."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch Review  The thought that comes to mind are the carcasses that rocky balboa were beating in the freezer to train for his fight with apollo creed.  ordered salmon \"pastrami\". Half of the salmon chunks were bruised like someone had beat the crap out of them. Ive had salmon pastrami before at Townhouse in nyc where the meat was paper thin. These were just chunks. flavorless.   My wife had nutella french toast. For some reason, they only made her half an order, then brought her another half an order 5 minutes later so that she had two breakfasts in front of her. One plate had nutella, the other did not. Was just really weird.  Our waitress was really nice and the only reason this place is getting two stars."}
{"text":"We really like this place and will be back. Fried Goat Cheese Olives - 5, Chorizo Stuffed Dates - 5+, CHEESE plate 5pc - 4(bit boring selection), LAMB GARGANELLI -5 We only had an issue with grilled eggplant pizza. The eggplant was very dry but crust was good."}
{"text":"The Caesar Salad (Romaine Salad) was the bomb. Perfect dressing, house-made croutons and shaved parmesean. mmm  The pizzas were really good. I tried the Margherita, the Fungi and the Romana. I think the Romana was my fav of the three. The garlic, chili flakes and anchovy oil gave it a lot of flavor. I had wished the black olives on it were kalamata though. They were just regular black olives.  The decor is interesting. Ultra modern and rustic at the same time. Somewhat strange, yet it works. It is apparent that they commissioned some serious interior decorator.  The bread is brought out in a little paper bag.  How green.  Cute, actually."}
{"text":"Fried Olive appetizer and Icelandic cod entree were phenomenal. Pizza and warm chocolate cake dessert were very good. Our waitress Kelly was outstanding.  Next time would sit in the bar area, the dining room is kind of loud and crowded and lacks ambiance.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out at flour last night. I had a gift card to use up. I called and decided to get dinner for my husband. I decided to order him a small lamb pasta. The small is 16.00 by the way. I went to pick it up and it was the smallest order I have ever seen in my entire life!! It was a side dish!! It was an even smaller portion then what you would get if your ordered chicken parm (at another restaurant) and got a side of pasta with it!! I was in such shock I actually went back in to inquire about this! The answer I got from the manager was that the pasta was homemade and they are in Moreland hills and they have to price accordingly. Sorry stupid answer. For 16.00 I could get a whole dinner with a salad and it would be 100 times better!! My husband ate it but was not impressed. So we will never go back. I would have been even more pissed off if I had paid for the food. Thank god I won that gift card!!! There are so many more restaurants with good home made food that will not try to rob you because of location!!! Don't eat here and support them!!! Terrible!!"}
{"text":"A cheese plate and a couple drinks in an empty restaurant.   My husband and I spent a wonderful afternoon picking berries and visiting farmers markets in Geauga county. We passed this place on Chagrin as we were looking for somewhere to grab a bite before heading back home. I had seen it on a few lists of hot new places to go so we stopped in.   We walked in and the hostess takes one look at us and asks if we have a reservation, no we did not but the restaurant was EMPTY at 630 on a Saturday night. . . I do not think they had anything to worry about. Though they acted like we had just killed their puppy with the dirty looks and rude manner. We were seated at a high top table by the bar. We decided to order a few appetizers and then split a pizza. For appetizers we selected chorizo stuffed dates (not exactly Italian but I'm willing to forgive) and a cheese plate.  We ordered a couple of cocktails I got the Campari and soda and my husband had the Italian lemonade.  I would love to say our middle aged male server made up for the rude hostesses but sadly he was just as snobbish and brattish as a 16 year old girl. The server went as far as to refuse to take our entree order then saying he would after we finished our apps.  The cocktails come and the only thing to say about either is BITTER. OK so I know Campari is a bitter, but I'm a fan of the aperitif when it is used properly. This was paired with an orange fennel soda that was bitter on it's own. Not the sweet citrus you need to counteract the bitterness to palatability. My husband's Italian lemonade made with a homemade lemonade soda and waterford bourbon barrel aged gin was also bitter. I'm not sure how being familiar with lemonade and the bourbon barrel aged gin on their own that in combination they become bitter unless the lemonade was bitter. Either way not a good combination.   Then it becomes a waiting game we wait. . . and wait. . . and wait and 20 minutes later. . .   Our appetizers came out!!! FINALLY. The chorizo stuffed dates were flawed. The dates were stuffed with the least spicy chorizo I have ever tasted. They were supposed to be pancetta wrapped according to the menu however ours were wrapped in plain old hickory bacon. Not a big deal I like bacon when properly executed but this was chewy. On to the sauce it was out of place. It was apparently roasted red pepper but it tasted like watered down Prego or Ragu. There really wasn't much to say about the cheese plate. A bleu, a soft cow sheep hybrid and some ash aged cheddar. The portions were ok. What was a disgrace was the crostini. 3 paper thin slices of walnut cranberry bread burnt beyond all recognition. There was a pineapple chutney on the side which while there was nothing wrong with it did not match the flavors on the plate. We finish our appetizers and our plates are taken.   And then we wait. . . and wait. . . and wait. . . and finally 15 minutes later someone finally asks us if we would like anything else, not would you like to order your entree now or can I suggest one of our wood fired pizzas. It was obvious they wanted their table back in the still mostly empty restaurant. I was already starting to feel nauseous and my husband also after slow rude service was not interested in staying. So we paid our check and left. We left a low tip but honestly the rude service deserved none. I remained nauseous and ill for the remainder of the evening.   We will never go back. I do not need to overpay for bitter cocktails and rude service and mediocre food.    There are no not to miss or hits and misses for this snooty establishment. Just avoid it like the plague."}
{"text":"Thrilled about this new venture from Paul and Christopher. They nailed it with the Baricelli Inn. I like the modern feel of the space, needs a few finishing touches to round out the look and feel.  Service was great!, hostess was great!  Bread was fresh and delicious. Italian wedding soup needed a little more flavor but all in all it was great!   Linguini w/Clam Sauce had fresh homemade noodles, great, I try this dish every chance I get and I make it at home. The key to success is a robust concentrated flavor that does not get absorbed by the pasta. This dish lacked flavor. Also I like the little clams but its a lot of work to remove the shells, a few for presentation is great but to many take away from my dining experience.  I'm looking forward to my next visit, overall good experience."}
{"text":"My old review deserves a much needed update. Brunch in Flour is a whole different ballgame altogether. I should describe their offerings as inventive, flavorful and bold. Hands down, the best Sunday brunch in the Chagrin-Woodmere-Solon area. I posted some pictures and they do  taste as good as they look. Shrimp and grits had a nice smokey flavor to it. Everything our party ordered; from the Eggs Benedict, to the Nutella French Toast, and the Breakfast Pizza did not disappoint.  Although, let's face it, they had me at.. BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS.  Did I say bottomless mimosas? Yes I did. You heard me..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and food is really good. Especially love their Sunday brunch, great for a Sunday fun day!"}
{"text":"Halibut piccata, was absolutely fantastic. I wish I took more pictures of all the appetizers we ordered.  Defiantly a nice evening out! And the French toast ice cream with espresso was an excellent light way to finish off the evening . The kitchen seemed extremely busy for a Tuesday evening but the food seemed to come out in a timely manner.  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant to go to for special occasions. Enjoyed the apps, food and cocktails every time. Staff and service was quick and courteous. Faroe Island Salmon, Skirt Steak, Lamb Rigatoni and Calamari top favorites."}
{"text":"Overall great first time experience. We went on a Sunday morning for brunch and our server was very pleasant and brought our order out quick.  We ordered Nutella French toast, shrimp and grits and a veggie omelet. Loved each item, French toast was my favorite and can't go wrong with Nutella ;) tried figuring out what sauce was used in shrimp and grits, maybe tomato and basil but I could be wrong, again was delicious. Definitely recommend this place for brunch at least and I'm excited to find out about lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area and decided to have dinner at the bar at Flour.  My first impression walking in was the design of the place:  Slightly modern, slightly elegant, and very sharp in my opinion.  My second impression was:  Where is everybody?  Granted, it was about 7:30pm on a Monday night, but an entire wing of the restaurant was empty, there were maybe 2 tables with people near the bar, and 6 or 7 dining at the bar.  More food for me, I guess...  I very much enjoyed the Chicken Meatball + Roasted Pork Belly Skewer.  The three chicken meatballs were very tasty and had a great mix of Italian herbs throughout.  On the other hand, the two pieces of pork belly were fairly unremarkable except for the fact that they were so small--smaller than a thimble, for reference.  The skewer is served on a bedding of arugula, radishes, and roasted red peppers, which basically becomes a de facto salad with the basil sauce along the edges of the plate.  It's a decent amount of food for an appetizer and can probably be shared comfortably among three people.  Next, I had a small portion of Gnudi.  Credit to Flour for having a smaller portion available during dinner time and particularly for this dish, which is quite filling.  This dish was recommended to me, but I can't say I share the same enthusiasm for it.  The gnudi itself is pretty fun to eat due to its pillowy texture.  I didn't like, however, the cilantro-lime-corn salsa sauce it was combined with.  The gooey nature of the sauce combined with the gooey pillows of gnudi to make a mush of a dish if you don't go about eating it very carefully.  Finished dinner with the Almond Panna Cotta, which I thought was very good and supplied with the perfect amount of sweetness from the almond.  I also really liked the presentation:  The panna cotta is served in a teacup with a chocolate chip cookie leaning up against the side of the cup to invoke a \"milk-and-cookies\" image.  The cookie itself was fairly average--I think it would have been a nice touch if the cookie were served warm.  Service was just about average, but then again, I was dining at the bar.  The staff--from the host, to the bartender, and the servers bringing the food--all seemed professional and relatively friendly.  The bread--which is pretty good--is served in the form of bite-sized pieces in a small burlap bag together with a plate of olive oil.  All in all, I thought Flour was a solid restaurant, and despite the rather stylish space, the food has an unpretentiousness about it that would make it a comfortable spot to get a bite to eat at just a notch above casual."}
{"text":"Did away with bottomless mimosas, now charge 8 bucks a piece, loved this place but 8 bucks is absurd, left and went to Paladar who had 3 dollar mimosas that were the same size, had a great time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere! You can't go wrong really with any choice of dish here. I recommend trying their pizzas and they're half off on Mondays! Can't beat it. Also, the atmosphere is really refined and modern. It's a great place for fun family get togethers or date nights. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My family and I had another great experience at Flour.  The service was prompt, the wine list, extensive and the food delicious.  This time we sat in the main dinning area , it was busy but not overly noisy.  The atmosphere was hip and fun.  A great place for a date or night out with the family.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have eaten at FLOUR over the years many times and have always had a pleasant and enjoyable experience. One time I observed the staff help an elderly person with a walking disability to their table and gently assisted her throughout the meal service. It is obvious that this restaurant does not discriminate as another reviewer has so viciously posted. It is dangerous for Yelp to allow such misleading and mispresented reviews to be posted as a \"factual\" experience - when that is just not true. This negative reviewer also stated that FLOUR is a joke. Nothing could be further from the truth/reality. FLOUR is a well regarded and loved by many fantastic dining experience in the greater Cleveland area. And second hand opinion - not first hand experience - should never be allowed on Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"A good neighborhood place with a very limited menu.  Relatively few \"healthy\" dishes, but this is not a place one goes to for a healthy meal.  Pizza and salads are good, but pricy.  It is located in an upscale community and the decor and prices reflect it."}
{"text":"Our first and only visit. Upon walking to our tables I noticed the stained, scratched and dirty looking steel tables. Not appetizing. The 70's music is blasting at full volume. The atmosphere is like an IKEA store. Cold air, cold tables, cold, hard chairs. I put the napkin - oops I mean old dishtowel on my lap - black pants - and the napkin dishtowel leaves white nasty fuzz all over my clothers. Not happy. The waitress comes over dressed in a pink plaid flannel shirt and literally whispers the specials to us. Did I mention  she was reading the specials as if she had never read them before. Stammering, mispronouncing words. It was ridiculous. Then comes the water. Tastes like it is straight from the toilet. I go outside to the car to get my bottled water. Now for the menu. Not sure what this place is trying to be. Surely not Italian.There is nothing on the menu that tempted me. Very limited and just plain weird selection. I ordered a salad, but the others in my party said the food was good - at least that's what I think they said as the music was roaring. The owner wandered around wearing a stupid baseball cap but never stopped at the tables to greet his guests. Too bad. The bread comes to the table in a tiny, stained burlap bag with a little handle. Only 3 itty bitty pieces of bread for the entire table. What an unsanitary way to serve bread! How many people have touched this bag, have dug their dirty hands inside in an attempt to locate their alloted morsel of bread. I think this place cannot make up its mind. Is it rustic? Is that why we have dirty burlap, old fuzzy dishtowels and plaid flannel waitresses? Is it modern? Is that why we have the emply warehouse atmosphere? Is it a bar? Is that why the music is blasting? And for sure, it's not Italian! All in all, very pathetic attempt to be something and I cannot even attempt to guess what that would be other than bad."}
{"text":"Amazing food Great Service Lunch and dinner services which are both awesome Wonderful Price Point  Plus a great old world wine list :-)"}
{"text":"Pizza is phenomenal.   Located in a discrete area, very quiet environment. Great place to meet up with 1-2 people."}
{"text":"Actually 3+. We live very close by and after waiting what seemed like forever waiting for this place to open all that we heard were bad things. And I mean from everyone that we knew who had been there. Consequently we stayed away for a couple of months. We finally went for dinner a couple of times last week and were really very pleasantly surprised. The food was quite good. The portions were not tiny as we had been led to beleive. It is, however, a little pricey for what you get. One dish that I can't say enough good things about was their pork chop. Everyone knows that I am a big pig and I thought that this was one HUGE and incredibly tasty piece of pork. The lovely Mrs had the roasted chicken and raved. Pizzas were also quite good but again pricey. The ambiance is a liitle too stark and cold for my taste. As the PD food critic said \"there is nothing rustic about this place\" food nor interior. We will certainly be back but not nearly as often as we would if it were a little less costly."}
{"text":"Wow! Great place for Sunday brunch. The Tuscan bean soup is flavorful and the perfect pair with their avocado toast!  The avocado toast is refreshing and a healthy way to start the day.   While I was hesitant to try the shagbark, spelt, & ricotta pancakes they were AMAZING. I feared they would be too sweet, but the pancake batter had a nice nutty flavor and the toppings has a touch of sweetness but overwhelming. Definitely give these a try. You will not regret it.  The real star of the show are the biscuits & gravy (on special). Throw out any notions you have of heavy biscuits smothered in fatty pork gravy. This was a light dish made with chicken gravy with hints of sage and saffron coming through. Seriously you must try this dish.   The atmosphere is elegant with plenty of natural light, tables for friends & family to dine at, or a bar if you'd like to stop in solo for brunch & mimosas!"}
{"text":"I was recommended to this restaurant by a foodie friend.  Loved the location and the ambience, light, airy and modern.  Was surprised (8pm Friday night) that there were quite a few empty tables, but still busy enough to have a nice buzz.  Service was good, the bread (and olive oil) was awesome.  Chose a nice bottle of merlot.  The local greens salad was very good, and fresh as would be expected.  However I made a poor choice of entree - the porchetta (pork) was small, salty and not at all inspiring.  My wife chose one of the specials - a veal chop served with 3 onion rings (note that the server made no mention of the prices of the specials - so foolishly we assumed that they were in the $15-$30 range of the standard entrees). The veal was pretty good - but a price gouge that I have never experienced before!  The typical entree price (like my tasteless porchetta) was $25, the special was $55!!!!! You've got to be kidding me.  The only thing that saved the day a little was the 20% Yelp check-in voucher.  Yes I would go back if in the area, but for the ambience, the salad and the bread.  Not for dinner I'm afraid.  What a pity!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed that they didn't offer the regular lunch menu on Sundays, but our brunch for nine was most excellent. The staff was on top of things, explaining some of the dishes in detail and allowing for substitutions and/or deletions. They were wise to bring the kids' food first--French toast stuffed with Nutella, mascarpone cheese and peanut butter, and topped with chopped apples & syrup. I ended up splitting the same dish with my girlfriend as well as eating half a plate of the amazing strozzapreti (literally \"priest strangler\"), twisted pasta served with caper-butter, arugula, castelvetrano olives, and white anchovies. So friggin' good!   Good bar, too. Several of us enjoyed drinks; I can personally attest to the fact that they know how to pour a generous glass of Bulleit bourbon with just the right amount of ice. Others in our group enjoyed a cheese pizza and the salmon pastrami (save some for me!)."}
{"text":"Great modern interior, fantastic as speedy service, and delicious food. This is a must have for Italian."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurant because of the atmosphere,food,and proximity to my home.  The pizza is great, but it is a little pricey and having lived in New York the pizza could use a bit more breading and char and bubbles, in addition the cheese could be fresher along with the tomato sause that lacks the unmph that i wished it had, also the topings are small yet abundant on each slice.  The burger is excellent and recently won an award,  the sandwiches are refreshing and the chips and fried slides are perfectly crispy.  The saladserve and soups are great clean and crisp dishes that are enjoyable for your tastebuds. Great place with a few quarks but I would not hesitate to recommend this joint."}
{"text":"What a great setting for brunch.  Love the decor, the service is great and the food is some of the best Italian food you'll find in Cleveland (way better and more genuinely Italian than in the majority of restaurants at Little Italy).  The pizzas are really good, they don't beat the ones at Vero's, but they are really good. The rest of the things I tried for brunch were delicious (had the flat bread panini and the potatoes girarrosto style) and they have several mimosa flavors.  Can't remember the name and can't find it in their menu, but they also have a caramel dessert (kind of a caramel pudding, comes in a glass) that I highly recommend you try (it's not in the menu but you should ask for it)."}
{"text":"Paul Minnillo and Christopher DiLisi, former owner/chefs of The Baricelli Inn decided to close up shop in Little Italy and start a new venture in the 'burbs of Moreland Hills. A lofty venture with grande expectations. Now that Flour has been open for nearly a month, we decided to give it a try.  The space is very modern. Industrial monotone colors, hard surfaces, clean lines, large windows, a glass tiled backdrop showcasing the centerpiece lounge/bar area and a giant glass wall of wine that separates the expansive restaurant in two. The wait staff is even mod. The uniform of choice is a plaid shirt and beard. Suburban Hipster if you will.   Oh, and I realize the mod music in the background thing may be a part of the whole mod theme this place is trying for, but I found it kind of humorous and distracting. The music played here would be something Margo & Todd Chester (neighbors of the Griswold's) in Christmas Vacation would listen to.  As for the food, we started with the special for the night. An appetizer of crab, pea and chive gnocchi. The pasta was fresh and cooked properly. The dish was very flavorful indeed and a perfect size to share. My only regret? There wasn't a spoon on the table to drink up the leftover sauce.   Next, I had my heart set on pizza. Through the open kitchen, I saw a wood fired oven built specifically for pizza cooking. We settled on the salsiccia pizza with sausage, crushed tomato, mozzarella, grana and oregano. We also opted for a fried egg on top for an additional $2. This would prove to be a mistake and a big reason for the 3.5 star rating. The egg came out raw. It looked as if it were cracked on top of the pizza, after cooking. The whites were still completely clear. I'm still amazed it made it out of the kitchen looking like that. Completely unacceptable from a place run by talent with such reputation. Fortunately, neither one of us are too grossed out by raw eggs, so we just forked it aside and devoured the rest of the pizza, in which I found somewhat unimpressive. Crostatas pizza it most certainly was not. I was regretting not ordering another pasta or meat dish for an entrée instead.   For dessert? A salted  chocolate brownie with basil ice cream. A perfect redemption for the previous course.   Overall, I found the menu somewhat limited, the space somewhat cold (although that's strictly a matter of opinion and taste) and the execution (specifically speaking of their egg cooking) in need of tweaking or with more oversight. Now, I'm not writing this place off. I want to give it another try. Every new restaurant goes through some growing pains and this one is no exception. Flour has great potential, it's just not there yet.  3.5 stars with room for improvement."}
{"text":"What a great surprise! I was traveling through Cleveland and stumbled upon this place when searching for outside, dog-friendly seating. We had a reservation, and were seated fairly promptly--you cannot reserve the patio, as we found out, so even with a reservation, it turns into first come, first served.   We went on a Friday evening, and, during summers, they run an outside table-side (steak? prime rib?) promotion that we did not select. But the outside seating is perfect for a hot summer's day, even if you not choose the table-side preparation option.   Chicken was exceptionally good, but I had higher expectations for the veal and would not get it again. Still, it was a fantastic, never rushed Italian meal and just what we were looking for.   The wine selection was very good with servers knowledgeable about pairings, but not bent on upselling customers. We decided to go with a Vermentino, and were very glad we did.   The restaurant is dog-friendly, and a few servers and even a member of the kitchen staff stopped by to say hello to our dog. Its one of the few higher-end places that takes a liberal approach to bringing pets, or so it appears from our search.   The parking lot looks like a luxury car lot, but lots of customers were in business casual. I would not suggest rolling in with jeans and a t-shirt; this is more of, at a minimu, a polo + kakhis place. you may feel under-dressed if you're not in a dress shirt indoors.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been there twice for brunch and loved it.  So I took my friends there tonight.  The entrees were good; but the Italian wedding soup I ordered was \"offensive\" tasting.  The broth was clear and dark; the vegetables in there were raw or just 10% cooked, unlike traditional Italian wedding soup having all the flavor of melted veggies; the broth does not have any depth of flavor but pure saltiness; the supermarket Italian wedding soup was far better and just costs fraction of the price they charge.  I called the waitress and returned the soup. My dessert \"warm apple\" something rather was very offensive tasting as well; there was no flavor in the apples; no sugar, cinnamon or nutmeg added;  the crumb was not browned enough to be crunchy; the only good thing was the vanilla bean ice cream, but I know they didn't make that.   Very disappointed at the soup and dessert, I think a 10 year old can cook better than that.   I am thinking this might be a lack of management issue that they allowed this kind of poor quality of food to be served at a I considered high end restaurant.  Will NEVER go back there again."}
{"text":"Most simply, if you're looking for a place with really crave-worthy, fresh Italian food, this is it.   Awesome things about Flour: - All of their noodles are made in-house. They have a cook who comes in during the middle of the night and makes all their noodles fresh. After dining at Flour, I now totally recognize the difference that homemade noodles make in an entrée.  - Complimentary valet. This is a rarity for anywhere near the bustling Eton Place!  - Really awesome custom drink menu. The Blueberry Sparkler is so legit. Props to their Wizard of Cocktails.  - If you're there for dinner, make sure you're reading the menu correctly. You can purchase entrees in either a \"little\" or a \"lotta\" size, but what it really means is \"appetizer\" size or \"full\" size. Go with the \"lotta\" size if you're looking for an entrée.  We started with the fried olives, which are stuffed with goat cheese. Even if you don't like olives, you can get into these cheesy tarts of goodness. The Lamb Rigatoni is absolutely to die-for...super tender meat, tasty sauce and the most delicious homemade rigatoni.   Literally everything that crossed are table, down to the complimentary bread, exceeded my expectations. If you're dining on the weekend, try to make a reservation around 4/5pm to avoid the mad rush. Either way, i'm sure you'll find the wait worth it."}
{"text":"The good:  The decor was fresh-looking and the bathroom was very clean.  Our waitress was attentive and very nice.  The \"Super Tuscan\" wine was very good, the bread they served with the appetizers came with quality olive oil and had a nice flavor, and the dessert (A caramel creme with orange scented whipped cream on top) was pretty good and large enough to split.  They also had good coffee, which steaming hot when the waitress brought it out.  My earring fell out when I was putting on my coat, and the waitress and bus person were nice enough to take a moment and help me find it, which I appreciated as well.   The not-so-good:  I love to cook and eat Italian food, so I'd been looking forward to my visit to Flour. I'm sorry to say the main word that described my experience there was \"disappointing.\"  The hostess was rude from the moment we called in our reservation. We arrived 10 minutes early, in no hurry, fully expecting to wait at the bar or in the waiting area, maybe with a drink, and she was downright curt, informing us when we simply approached her to check in for our reservation that we \"would have to wait the full time.\" (We were in absolutely no hurry and as I said, fully expected to wait until our reservation time had arrived...). The bartender, likewise, was just kind of oddly cold and bordered on rude. She seemed visibly miffed that we \"only\" ordered a $60 bottle of wine to share between the three of us who were drinking. Sorry.   The bad:  We were seated at our table and our waitress did come right over to take our orders and explain the specials, etc. As I said above, she was very nice and we had no problems with her service.  We tried maybe 7 different dishes at my table and nothing \"wowed\" any of us whatsoever. There were some pretty big misses, and at the price point of $22-$40+ for many of the dishes, there really shouldn't be mistakes of this kind.  Appetizers were just okay (mussels and calamari were the two we ordered; someone at our table ordered a salad as well and said it was okay). The broth the mussels were served in did have a lot of flavor. As far as the main dishes, I ordered the veal parmesan, and it was just okay. The veal itself was overcooked on the edges, but the middle was still very tender. The sauce it was served with was very good. The pasta was a disgrace. I've never seen \"spaghetti\" that looked like that in my life, it truly looked and tasted like something out of a can or from a school lunch room rather than from an \"Italian Kitchen.\" It was extremely overcooked, soggy, and mushy.   I tasted the tagliatelle served with ragu alls bolognese was alright- again, mushy and overcooked, with a bland sauce. Nothing special.  My sister ordered the pumpkin agnolotti. I didn't personally taste hers, but I know she wasn't happy with it. She said the pasta was undercooked in this case (not al dente, undercooked), which really didn't mesh well with the textures of the spiced apple and the pumpkin. She also said there was something \"off\" about the dish although she couldn't explain exactly what the issue was.   The ugly:  The next day after eating at Flour, two of us had sour stomachs and felt terrible all day long. I can't say for sure that it's related, but something didn't agree   TL; DR Overpriced Italian food, poorly conceived with average-at-best execution. Would not recommend to friends, and almost no chance I'll go back."}
{"text":"Excellent addition to the Cleveland dining scene.   I would describe it as upscale rustic Italian. As another review mentioned, they don't have a very extensive menu: a few small plates and salads, a variety of pizzas and pastas, and a few entrees. But everything we had was excellent.   Among the three of us we tried three entrees: the scallops, the gnudi (similar to gnocchi), and the veal short ribs. All were very good and the veal was excellent. The Caesar salads were nice and very traditional (slightly poached egg on top) and the asparagus were excellent. Desserts were very nice too.   The service was uniformly excellent, just the perfect balance of friendly and professional, attentive but not clingy; as good as any service I've had around here.   It is pricey, but definitely will go again on some special occasion."}
{"text":"Delicious. The cauliflower soup is to die for. Great pizza and a great wine selection!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has steadily gotten better, not that it was ever bad.  One of our favorite bartenders, Joe Knauff, is there on Friday nights and simply follow his suggestions on the best meals and wine to try that night.  We had two pasta dishes that may have been the best we have ever eaten.  Great service and atmosphere, we are lucky to have a restaurant like this in our area.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visiting on a business trip. For a Wednesday night was really busy but staff was attentive. Everything was ridiculously salty. Even the bread. Had to send the calamari back because it was inedible!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch and attentive service.  The menu is much more varied than it used to be and there is now something for everyone.  Prices are fair and it is a place I plan to visit regularly."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and the service.  Food is excellent.  We had stuffed dates for appertizer and arugula salad.  Both very yummy and fresh."}
{"text":"We went here for an early brunch and liked it very much! The staff were uniformly smiling and helpful and the food was very good. We will have to come back before we know if this will be one of our favorites but it certainly will be a nice place to come. By the way , we did not find it in the least pretentious or a place to see and be seen. On the contrary, our varied group was most comfortable."}
{"text":"5/5/18 awesome atmosphere. Waiter was very knowledgeable. Had wood oven roasted octopus. Great flavor. Fried olives were delicious. Cesar okay l, but nothing special. White anchovies extra.  Tagliatelle pasta with bolognese sauce good, not great. Spicy margarita best part of meal. Springer mountain airline chicken good. Overall interesting flavors and great atmosphere, however better places for the price."}
{"text":"Dinner is hit or miss, I do not recommend the lobster pasta, it was very bland, the truffled tots and fried olives are very good.  The best experience I had was during lunch, had to try the Ohio Beef Burger (received rave reviews from local Scene Magazine).  It was fantastic and came with truffle chips (very addictive).  I was so full I could not eat dinner later that evening.  So, with my experience, best time to go is lunch.  If I ever go for dinner again, I now know what to avoid"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first lunch visit to Flour.  Lunch menu is completely different from their dinner menu so I'll have to come back again and try out the pasta dishes.  Our server was very attentive.  She offered us suggestions on the wood fired pizzas and appetizers.  Our orders were accurate and brought out in a reasonable time.    We started out with the Truffled Parmesan Tator Tots. Nice size tots with slivers of truffle fried golden brown.  Simply delicious plain or with the roasted garlic aioli.  I had the Porchetta Bahn Mi sandwhich.  A nice fusion of Italian and Vietnamese.  The combination of the veggies and the prochetta blended well.  There were nice char marks on the bread from the panini press. The aioli saved the sandwich from being too dry.  A solid item that I would order again.  I'm looking forward to trying other things on their menu next time I come back."}
{"text":"Flour was tasty! For the items or bites that weren't crazy good, they really cared to know. That tells me Flour is the type of restaurant who that wants to improve and provide the best experience possible for customers.   The spaghetti+clam dish unfortunately ended up with some old tasting clams, but they whisked it away and brought back a new one. The beef cheek tortellini was delicious, though the tortellini noodles were a bit thick to bite through. Those are my only complaints!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant! My family often goes there for lunch and dinner. Pizzas by far the best in Cleveland, and their ever changing menu never disappoints.   The reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because today I decided to try their Sunday brunch. I was a bit confused because they do not offer egg whites. The waitress explained that they use an egg wash, but when I questioned how they got poached and sunny side up eggs, she said they were pre prepared. Additionally, the breakfast potatoes were quite dry, and the short rib hash sauce was way too spicy! As someone who quite enjoys heat, I could barely get through a few bites.   However, the breakfast pizza was fantastic. As I stated earlier, their pizza is the best I've had anywhere in Cleveland. Despite a few minor errors, I will definitely be adding Flour's brunch to the list of meals that I look forward to eating there!"}
{"text":"3 words...  Chorizo Stuffed Dates.. Unbelievable.   What a breath of fresh air in the Solon area. I felt like I was in Vegas again. The place looked cool, the people looked hot, and the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We went as 3 couples to Flour this week - it was pretty good overall. I don't think we will return often, but it was a nice change of pace from some of the Italian places in town. The decor is very modern. I liked it - seemed very \"clean\" which is important in a restaurant! But as some others noted, it is loud when full.  I liked the selection of wines by the glass - very unique, not the typical options at all. The waiter offered to bring me a few to try before selecting. The menu also had many unique options. Tried the calamari for an app - it was VERY tender and yummy. We had all pastas and one pizza for dinner - it seemed as though everyone enjoyed their meals. Overall a bit salty but very tastey.  I will return again for dinner or for a glass of wine at the bar."}
{"text":"Had an ok dinner (much overpriced for food that's pretty generic and not done too well). Unfortunately that resulted in food poisoning for my girlfriend. When we contacted them they tried to cover up. We never heard back from the owner after many attempts. They did eventually offer us a $50 voucher to go back there (dinner itself was $140, plus an emergency room bill). Wish I could give no stars to this review. An apology or a phone call from the owner would have gone some ways."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the first time, it was so loud I had to leave before we ordered food. To be fair, it was opening night and the place was packed with very excited patrons.  This time, the noise level was much better, but one side of the restaurant had  an unpleasant smell which was attributed to the fact it had just rained. My husband couldn't stand the smell, and requested we move to the other side, which they very quickly and kindly did. The smell did not follow us there, thankfully.   As for the food, the appetizers were great. We got calamari, the stuffed peppers and eggplant meatballs. The meatballs were definitely my favorite. We tried three pizzas, with the artichoke and spinach being the table favorite. The sausage and margherita were pretty good, but I felt the pizza was slightly burned. It was okay, but I most likely would want to try another entree  if we go back.   The service was great, though as were the cocktails. I would go back again, but mostly if someone else suggested it."}
{"text":"Great service but awful food and overpriced. The chicken we had was dried out and yet not properly cooked.  The tatter tots were OK but was drenched with cheese sauce. My wife con not tolerate overly spiced food and even though what she ordered was said not be spicy, it was. The mimosa was thimble sized and over priced. Not likely to return.  A very noisy place"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Flour for my birthday dinner and we weren't expecting much to be honest. We have heard mix opinions and we still cannot figure out why. Although I can't have dairy, I was willing to give this Italian restaurant a try and I am so happy we did.   We got to Flour early and sat at the bar where we were treated to a show. The kitchen is all open where they have a wood burning fireplace and fast moving staff. I ordered the Spicy Flour Margarita and my husband the Kentucky Bourbon Ale that was on draft. The Spicy Flour Margarita was a blast of color and spice, and even though it was delicious, my taste buds would've disowned me if I had a second due to the heat.   We then were seated in the dining room which was pretty tight but high ceilings allowed for a more spacious feel even though we were all seated pretty close. I ordered the muscles for an appetizer that I seriously was licking the plate. We asked our server twice for more bread because we just couldn't eat the broth fast enough. She even asked us if we wanted a straw, and honestly, we debated if we should.   For dinner, I got the spaghetti and clams that was honestly to die for. My husband devoured the lasagna. When he took the first bite, he threw down his spoon. I asked what was wrong and his response was \"This is THE BEST lasagna I have EVER had!\". As I stated before, I cannot have dairy, so after seeing that reaction, I was very bummed I couldn't have a bite.   In regards to the fact I can't have dairy, our server was an absolute doll and patient with me telling me which plates that could easily make dairy free for me which I was so greatly appreciated of. I really wish I caught her name but I was too busy consuming my body weight in the pasta they make in house.   I can't express enough how delicious Flour was and how amazing the entire staff is! We cannot wait to come back and will definitely be bringing friends and family to get a taste of this little slice of Italy!"}
{"text":"Took my team at work for lunch here.  Very friendly staff, food was pretty good, but I wouldn't necessarily say this was the best place I've eaten in CLE.  Good option if you're looking for a different scene, but not memorable delicious food."}
{"text":"This is a really upscale and trendy brunch spot. It is located in a pretty quiet place and the window seats look out to trees which makes it seem more secluded. It's worth it to be a little dressy when brunching here, it's well decorated and the space is open. We sat at the bar and the service was prompt and the staff was attentive and friendly. The mimosas come in an array of fruity flavors, made from a fruit puree, and it is worth trying. The coffee is also freshly brewed and strong.   The salmon spread bagel was really delicious! The portion and presentation was perfect and the fresh fruit on the side balanced the meal. My husband got the eggs Benedict and the poached eggs were perfectly cooked. The bacon also needs a special mention."}
{"text":"my review for Flour is long overdue, especially with the recent drama surrounding a teenagers meal.   last week I saw a review from a girl named Quinn, explaining a situation her brother was in at Flour. firstly, Yelp does not allow people to give secondhand reviews based on someone else's experience so any credit given to her story should quickly be nulled. when I read her review stating that Flour \"discriminates against people with disabilities\" I was absolutely floored. I messaged her and told her that she is acting as if Flour turns away handicapped people at the door when in actuality she is referring to food allergies. Again, she's also acting like if you have food allergies then you will be turned away here and that is simply not the case. Why does my opinion matter? Because I also have life threatening food allergies.   Here is where MY review based of MY experiences begins. My mom and I chose Flour to have my bridal shower at. They are closed on Saturdays and we will have the entire place to ourselves. The food is exceptional to say the least. We met with Chef Mytro to discuss the apps, entrees and desserts. Here he basically stated I could do anything I wanted and he would personally prepare my food based on my allergies (milk & eggs). He was one of the most accommodating people I have ever met.   My family and I also dined here shortly after. The waitress was MORE than accommodating with my allergies and yet again Chef Mytro prepared a special dish for me. To say the word discrimination in the same sentence as this restaurant should be a sin. Flour goes above and beyond to accommodate EVERYONE.   Today, my mom sent me an article on the aforementioned girl, Quinn, yelp review. I read that her parents were getting lawyers involved because her brother was charged (then waived) $15 for sitting at this restaurant. I am STUNNED. You should be absolutely ashamed of yourself for bringing bad publicity like this to a renowned restaurant. I am simply disgusted in this family to say the least.  To base your entire review off your brother \"being charged $15\" for sitting there, when they didn't even follow through with it, is absolutely asinine. To say that this place discriminated against anyone is asinine. Talk about making a mountain out of a molehill. These are the type of people who ruin things for the rest of us. A lack of communication and a misunderstanding blown out of proportion and now you want to involve lawyers? This is world we live in now. PATHETIC.   On the bright side, this restaurant has a phenomenal reputation and I am willing to bet a few bad apples out there looking for a payday won't ruin that. I truly feel secondhand embarrassed for those people.   Keep up the great work and I can't wait for my shower!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in this area!  Seriously, my husband and I moved to Twinsburg and have been having a terrible time finding good food.  The bread is soft and airy with a crispy yet easily tearable crust.  The cheese board appetizer sports unique and delicious cheeses.  Also, if you like scallops then get that dish!    Secret:  they have a kids cheese pizza that is available off menu.  Very upscale yet kid friendly place."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing food and great service! The fact that this place doesn't have at least a 4-star rating blows my mind."}
{"text":"My son and daughter-in-law and I went here for dinner during the Christmas season.  The server explained the specials and the salmon with squash sticks and cauliflower sounded awesome.  What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  The vegetables were nothing more than a garnish!  TWO buds of cauliflower and some THREADS of squash which were really tasteless.  The salmon was tasty, but quite greasy. $29 for just a piece of salmon! My son had the chicken Cacciatore, which was tasty, but I felt overpriced. In general, I think all the food is overpriced and the portions are very skimpy. I would not go here again."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner. We try to branch out and eat at different restaurant but we always end up coming back to flour because the food is just so good. The service here is very very good the waiters are always very attentive even to the children. They never get annoyed at little extras that you request.we had the most amazing softshell crab appetizer and the mussels here are something that we always get every time we come. I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal here. They change the menu up seasonally and use very modern ingredients."}
{"text":"Simple but excellent menu.  All pastas are good. Monday is the day to go for $8 pizzas and discounted draft beers. We like the vibe of the lounge and usually ask for and get a high top. Good place to watch the Tribe or Cavs on TV. This is not your ordinary red-sauce Italian joint.  Go, you will be happy.  An update:  Flour is usually loud to almost unbearable. Tonight was ridiculous. They had entertainment that  was so loud that it ruined the whole experience.  What is the point?  Terrible night with an out of town guest. Do not go, you will not be happy when they amp up the joint. By the way, do not order the Caesar salad. Expensive romaine with absolutely no Caesar taste, almost like eating a plate of rabbit food."}
{"text":"I live in the Columbus area and every time I come to Cleveland I make sure to stop at Flour. It is the best Italian food in the city and their homemade pasta is to die for. You have to try the tagliatelle and fungi pizza, both are top notch. Service is always perfect, whether its the constant refills on water to someone taking your dirty plates as soon as you are finished. Keep up the great work! We will be continue to be customers every time we are in town."}
{"text":"I went to Flour for Sunday Brunch on 2/28/2016.  I met a new friend there.  We were seated near a window at a two top.  Next to us were two families at a family party with kids etc.  all having fun.  The atmosphere was both elegant and very friendly.  I was very comfortable. Service was prompt and knowledgeable.  I had the eggs Benedict which distinguish themselves with mortadella vs the typical Canadian bacon.  Mortadella is a type of Italian sausage and it was less moist and I would say more tasty than Canadian bacon or as tasty but different in texture and it was a lovely switch out.  My friend had a flat bread panini and it was large and she had to take a lot home.  We split an order of Paul's Sausage was in a homemade spicy pork sausage and was really good.   We were so full we could only split one of the two.  We had coffee, fresh orange juice and fresh grapefruit juice.   It was a relaxed, lovely enjoyable brunch  with reservations at 11:30. We were not hurried to get out or move along.  We lingered and talked and had a nice time.  While its a good sized restaurant its not loud.  While I have marked dress as casual the casual was up casual I would say.  They have an unlimited mimosa option but we did not have any of it."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Crostatas has way better pizza. The service was terrible. Don't waste your money. Lots of better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Consistently stellar. Love the atmosphere, love the menu selection and they even carry my favorite scotch. I'd eat there every day if I could.  Sunday brunch was one of the best in the area.  The antipasti platter is a great way to start over cocktails.  Always good, always wanna go back."}
{"text":"I came to Flour with very high expectations after many good reviews from friends. I was disappointed. To some up my experience I would say that it was: Remarkably unremarkable. The staff was fine and friendly, nothing special, but good at their jobs. The dining area and bar were well designed and looked great with a killer wine room complimenting the space. The food is where this place fell flat. I ordered the Veal Parmesan ($31) and my girlfriend ordered the Semolina Gnocchi ($14). Now I love a good veal parm and when I saw a $30 veal I was quite excited to try it thinking that for such an astronomical price it would be of the highest caliber taste. I thought wrong. Overcooked, over-breaded, and under seasoned, the veal was a far cry from a $30 value. Its pathetic pasta counterpart was kin to grade school cafeteria lunches. The $14 gnocchi, while nothing special itself, was far superior to the veal. This place was a let down. I expect I will revisit, but with much lower expectations."}
{"text":"Good, but not great.  Started off with the local greens salad, mine was good, my wife's had wilted pieces in it.  For main course, I had the fall squash ravioli which turned out to be the best thing the entire evening.  My wife had the roasted cauliflower risotto.  The risotto was topped with an arugula salad which had a really strange, smoky dressing that completely clashed with the risotto.  My wife hated it so much that she had to completely eat around it.  Don't understand what the chief was thinking with this pairing.  My wife also commented that there didn't seem to be many pieces of cauliflower in the risotto.  For dissert I finished with the zeppole, which was covered in way to much cinnamon sugar and OK.  My wife had something (can't remember the name) that was similar to a warm molten lava cake.  That was good.  The atmosphere/décor was really cool and enjoyable.  I'd go back to try a pizza, but that's about it.  For a place owned by Paul Minillo I have much higher expectations."}
{"text":"We've been here for brunch quite a few times now; it's hard to compete with 15$ bottomless mimosas! Order the oxtail hash and the spicy potatoes, trust me! Today I had the bahn mi, which in spite of surprising me by being on foccia, was quite good.  As far as service goes we didn't really want for anything, although somewhat humorously they were recycling our flutes because they didn't have enough glasses!   You'll shell out a few bucks for it, but definitely a solid brunch."}
{"text":"Falls short...  Which is too bad, because the place is really likable.  The location is nice, the ambience is nice, the menu is nice, and everyone is so nice.  To expand on the menu, it really is an eclectic mix of non-traditional dishes and some hipster flair.  Ox tail, bone marrow, etc.  I can deal with all this, and you should branch out when you can.  The strong concept ends up with the execution just okay.  The menu has side salads ($9), pasta, entrees,  and pizza.  On my two visits, I tried a special with pork and Brussel Sprouts, and spaghetti with clams the last.  The spaghetti was homemade and delicious (and plentiful, what looked like a pound) but only featured 10-12 small clams for all the pasta.  Tasty, yes, but not proportioned well.  My coworker got veal and it was slightly dry and in his words \"just okay\".  I'll have to scour special deals and the pizza menu if I come back.  Additionally, don't be fooled by the $$ rating.  It's a $$$ (but the pizza is $$)."}
{"text":"I have been for dinner several times, but just decided to try brunch today. As I love what this restaurant's self-proclaimed \"rustic\" style does to traditional Italian food, I figured they would also have a good brunch.  I was excited about the pork banh mi on the menu, but when I asked the waitress informed me it was a fatty pork cut. She said there was tenderloin present, but that shredded pork belly was also present.   I ordered the veggie omelet instead. The flavor was really good! There were only peppers inside, red and orange, but it was delicious in its simplicity.   Watch when you order breakfast items as some come with fruit and others potatoes. I thought the omelet came with potatoes so I ordered a side of fruit and then when the food came I had 2 sides of fruit because the omelet really came with fruit.   I felt the waitress should have said something when I ordered an additional side of fruit, like you know it already comes with fruit. But she didn't. But she did willingly bring me a side of potatoes and not charge me for them and let me keep the fruit.   They also have for $15 unlimited mimosas and they come in 3 flavors in addition to orange.   The same cool atmosphere and lively crowd for brunch as there is at dinner time. I definitely like the spin this place puts on food and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, I liked the fact that a lot of people came there with kids. The food was good, and the drinks were great. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We went to Flour for brunch, and overall had a great experience. Our server, Katie, was very personable, knowledgeable, and attentive. Our food came out quickly and everyone in our group loved what they got. The only reason I took off a star is because it seems a bit overpriced. The food is good, but $11 for eggs and home fries seems a bit excessive."}
{"text":"We went to Flour at 9:00 on a Saturday and it was bustling, as usual.  It was also restaurant week and their menu was one of the most appetizing on the list of restaurants, so I am sure that had something to do with the energetic crowd.  The pork chop and brussels sprouts was AMAZING and a huge portion - we had an entire piece to bring home (and even though it was my boyfriend's meal, I have DIBS on that.  YUM).  My pasta was amazing, as usual.  Hoping to make it out for happy or lunch sometime soon !"}
{"text":"Wow.. deliciousness from start to finish. Very fresh salads & great dressings. My husband had calamari as an appetizer which he loved. Entrees were Salmon & Homemade Pasta with clams. Both were outstanding. Wonderful wine list. Atmosphere was great and waitress was wonderful & efficient. It was so wonderful seeing many families out to dinner for Mother's Day. We both cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best neighborhood restaurant you can ask for.  The pizza is fantastic, the bolognese sauce amazing, and the gnocchi is equally impressive.  Lunch is overlooked there, the combos are excellent.  Sometimes it's a bit of a 'scene' at the bar at night, but that's hardly a complaint.  Half off pizza night is Monday and half off bottle of wine night is Tuesday night.  I would love to review the brunch, but I haven't tried it.  Yet.  I love sneaking out on a weeknight for dinner at Flour."}
{"text":"average food with small portions with somewhat expensive prices"}
{"text":"I had to amend my previous review based on a recent trip to Flour. I went with a group and we did the whole happy hour and then dinner thing.  The service during happy hour is where I had the most major of issues. We were seated at a table in the bar area and were basically ignored. It took approximately 8 minutes for menus to even be brought over to us, another 10 for waters, and another 10-15 for our drinks. We noticed our waiter was busy schmoozing with other tables, and one specifically that looked like he was a regular. That customer came in about 20 minutes after us and still got his drink before us. We were routinely ignored and not happy at all about it. The other people in my party were so upset they wanted to leave, and I had to convince them to stay. From the time we sat until we got our first drink, it was about 30 minutes. That's way too long.  My other complaint is the eggplant meatballs. They're still good, but they've changed in size and texture since my last trip, and not for the better. Much smaller and not as crunchy on the outside as they were previously.  I must also agree with other reviewers that the cheese looked like it came from a green can.   Before this last trip I was willing to make the hour long drive, but not anymore, especially because the prices seem very inflated compared to even last time. The food is still good, but not good enough that I would drive and hour out of the way."}
{"text":"I end up here a lot, but not because I'm in love with it.  It's on my route.  Flour is OK.  The food is good, the drinks are good, but even as I write this review, I can't even recall what I ate or drank.  It was so un-remarkable I have to think about it.  Oh wait,  the fried olives, salad, mushroom pizza and a beverage.  The food was good.  I wouldn't complain about it at all.  Let just say I don't go home thinking about it or craving it.    This is a swanky sort of place.  There are always people hanging around who want to be seen.  There is some pretentiousness going on.   There are a lot of happy hour lingerers as well.  If you are from the Solon area, you will likely bump into someone you know.     The hostesses tend to be younger girls and the servers are more mature.  Overall, I cannot complain about the service.  I have never had poor service.  Again, it's all sort of unremarkable to me one way or another."}
{"text":"An upscale restaurant with tasty offerings.  I have been there at least 5 times.  The food is not cheap but can't say I've ever had a bad meal there.  The short rib is probably my favorite with a side of local greens.  I've tried their brunch once and it was decent.  Flour is my go to place for date night on the east side."}
{"text":"Once you get over the odd location for Flour, the interior is welcome and comfortable, if a bit loud.  The menu has a nice variety of food, all of it inventive and executed very well.  The only quibbles were what seemed to be an artificially slowed service and a lackluster slate of dessert offerings.  Overall, a very good experience and one I'd try again."}
{"text":"Went for date night last night. Energetic vibe, free valet and exceeding knowledgeable servers. Well thought out wine list. Decent mushroom pizza, tasty tagliatelle (needs more ragu) but the real star was the magnificent grilled octopus. Salad was very unimaginative and dessert menu was a yawn fest. Overall a great option for the area will be back"}
{"text":"Matt Mytro is the most talented chef out there!! His fungi pizza is out of this world! He is super friendly and a shooting star! Can't wait to dine at flour again soon! Thank you Matt for being amazing!"}
{"text":"Flour has so greatly improved since my other review in January 2012. The Cheeseburger I had for lunch was one of the best I have ever had. Service was friendly, efficient and much improved. Great job Flour on getting it together!"}
