{"text":"Great little atmosphere to work or meet with people.  I'm not a big coffee guy, so can't tell u if that's good or not.  But, I enjoyed it and the place just has a great feel to it!"}
{"text":"The small coffee shop that makes you feel just relaxed. This place has great drinks, smoothies and food. If you are tired of starbucks feeling too generic this place fills your fix. The interior atmosphere is homely and brings out the uniqueness in this place. Definitely a hidden gem in the desert."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place! We love coming here with our bikes and having our breakfast. Their leather sofas are so comfortable."}
{"text":"This place is small and easy to miss but if you find it, it will be a great pleasure. The coffee is very good and the baristas are well trained, even to the extent of putting espresso art in the foam of capuccinos and lattes. Above all, the employees are incredible friendly and helpful and treat each customer with respect. If your in the area, stop on by and check it out."}
{"text":"The blended caramel coffee is pretty good, different then expected but good. I would return :)"}
{"text":"Local feel, community goings on, and really good coffee. They have several couches, plenty of tables and lots of snack and food options. The breakfast croissant sandwiches are amazing."}
{"text":"Love this locally owned coffee shop! It has a very casual, comfortable atmosphere; you can sit at traditional tables or on the comfy couches. Their chicken salad is fantastic. This morning I had a \"Moose Tracks\" coffee flavored with eggnog, which is now my new favorite!"}
{"text":"I LOVE COFFEE....Try this place.   You won't regret it!!  Get the Mexican Mocha....You will be hooked for life!!"}
{"text":"Adorable coffee shop that serves delicious breakfast. Real espresso drinks. Comfortable seating and lots of cool decorations to keep the kids' occupied. Staff was very friendly too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has a GREAT friendly and local atmosphere.  I had the strawberry banana smoothie which was AWESOME.  Perfect morning snack, try the cinnamon bear claw which they heated up to make it even better.  Perfect spot to meet up for a business connection or hang out and get some work done.  I've been here 5 times now and ALL of the employees are friendly and helpful with drink selections.  Skip the Bucks and go to THE CABIN.  You'll love it."}
{"text":"The drinks are great. The bagels are great, however the rest of the food is border line. Great place to study and achieve goals."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time this week and tried the Black Bear latte. Delicious!  The atmosphere reminds me of the local coffee shops back in the Midwest, which made me feel warm and fuzzy. The staff was friendly but seemed too busy catching up with one another to focus on making my drink.  I will definitely go back. Starbucks doesn't even begin to compare."}
{"text":"Decent food. I got the cheese ham and egg croissant sandwich. There was WAY too much egg on it it. Other than that it was pretty good. The coffee I got was a vanilla iced coffee & I thought it could have more vanilla flavor. I honestly wouldn't come back over priced & I could find something much better."}
{"text":"Best coffee and breakfast sandwiches ever!!! Get the ultimate on a crescent. Muffins are great as well. Completely beats Starbucks. Atmosphere is great with room to eat or just hang out. Even seating outside.  Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the service can be spotty depending on when you go. Sometimes early am on the weekends they only have 1 person working. So it can take more than reasonable time to wait for a sandwich (though soooo worth it!!). Occasionally had this happen during the week. Once the rush comes they seem to have more people working so its not as bad. Still worth the wait but can be irritating.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Refreshing coffee shop.  Friendly staff and good coffee.  Elvis bagel is a great go to."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches are yummy and the coffee is good. The place has a good old charm. Very friendly girl at the counter."}
{"text":"I have never been by in the evening, but every few weeks I stop in for a morning treat before work. I love the cozy, cabin vibe. The Mexican Mocha is my absolute favorite. It is so nice to have a coffee shop like this near my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This ultimate breakfast croissant is as delicious as as it looks, and their coffee and customer service is just as great! I absolutely love Cabin Coffee, the shop it's self is a wonderful environment for studying or hanging out."}
{"text":"Iced teas are great with many flavors to choose from. They also serve pastries,salad and warm/cold sandwiches."}
{"text":"went here with my three year old and they made her a chocolate milk even though it is not on the menu, they have awesome croissant sandwiches as well as the espresso. the people are very nice too:)"}
{"text":"I have been going to this coffee shop  since 2004. And I have known the previous owner since then.  Davney added her personal touch to the decor.  Stepping into this place is like stepping into a log cabin.  It is warm and inviting. And the espresso there is spectacular. The previous owner sold the business but nothing was changed.  It's the same place that I have called \"my coffee shop\" for the past ten years."}
{"text":"The first time we just came for coffee   Next visit was for coffee and breakfast   After that it was for great chicken salad sandwiches on croissants. The coffee the food the service and the cosy comfortable atmosphere had made this our favorite neighborhood place. I almost hate to write a rave review on this place for fear it might get discovered by others. But the people running this place deserve the praise"}
{"text":"I discovered Cabin Coffee a couple of years ago.  I can't say enough about the lovely folks who work there and the owner.  Sweet, sweet people.  The food is really great but it's the coffe that makes my day. Gave up my Starbucks card for their Cabin Coffee card!  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"This is the coolest little nook! I had breakfast here yesterday and it was amazing! Great atmosphere and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Enjoy the atmosphere and their breakfast sandwiches are great. Will continue to patronize this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get coffee. They remember your name even when you're not a regular. The coffee is better than the large chain coffee shops in my opinion too."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I ordered a latte and it was on point. I was happy to support a local business and the girls working were friendly.  The second time I came in I grabbed a hot tea and a yogurt parfait. I watched the lady scratching her butt through her yoga pants as she walked to the back to make it. Thankfully she washed her hands before she got started but I was already over it at this point. I didn't plan on eating anything but politely waited...and waited...and waited. They certainly put a lot of time and effort into a parfait.  It was a pretty fancy yogurt option after the long wait... Except for the 18inch red curly hair wrapped in the top.  Health code standards have gone out the window in the valley."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! I have gone a handful of times in my short time visiting Az and I have not had one thing I havent enjoyed. I wish this place were in Ca cause it is seriously so good! Beats Starbucks and Dunk n Donuts any day!"}
{"text":"I love Cabin Coffee! The coffee is so yummy and the atmosphere is very cozy and welcoming. It's one of my favorite coffee shops and is a nice break from chain coffee shops. The only reason why I have given this coffee house 4 stars instead of 5 is that many times there's not enough staff. Many times I've gone into the place with only 3 or 4 customers in line with only 1 or 2 workers and it's taken about 15 minutes to get a latte. It's not a big deal that it runs slower than most places, but I'll avoid going here if I am in the slightest rush just since the wait time is unpredictable from very fast to a very long wait time.  Another thing I'd like to see is more of a pastry selection :) this doesn't effect my review, but they don't have many sweet treats so it would be nice to see a better selection! Might be my imagination, but it seems like there's more meal-food than sweets and I wish there were more sweets!"}
{"text":"I showed up an hour and a half before they were closing. The place is nicely decorated and the cashier/barista was friendly enough, but i got the vibe that he wasn't too excited for me to show up because they were closing soon-ish. I ordered a small coffee and a pastry and sat down to do a bit of writing. Coffee was average. About 15 minutes later a girl started coming around to the few groups that were left in the place and offerring them free pastries because they had leftovers and were about to close. I felt sheepish because i had just paid full price for something they were giving away now, but i figured i they would be as nice to me as they were to everyone else in the place and offer me some free pastries too. I was wrong. The girl avoided me and gave free pastries to everyone else in the shop. As i was trying to surmise why i got skipped on the pastry fest, a couple of people came in to order but left without ordering because the workers were in a rush to close. The worker's words were welcoming but their tone and body language was otherwise. The place may be awesome, but it left me with a bad impression. I'll try another place first before coming back again."}
{"text":"Cabin Coffee is my all time favorite place to treat myself when in the mood for coffee.  I've never experienced a bad drink, service is great, very clean, and I love doing homework here.  The cozy environment makes me feel at home."}
{"text":"This place has become a regular stop in our household. I love the coffee and iced teas and my kids LOVE the smoothies!!!  the sandwiches are delish too!  Service is always excellent."}
{"text":"Laid back coffee shop with friendly staff, reasonable prices, and great coffee! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Exactly the type of coffee spot I've been looking for. Not too crowded, not too loud, and a great amount of work space. The vibe is ok. You can definitely tell who the regulars are because they get alot of love and appreciation lol. Either way, this is definitely on my list of places to check out. I just wish it was open later bc Luxe has turned into a club but its one of the only two late night study/work spots."}
{"text":"Stuck in the area for a 2 hour oil change, I didn't feel like having McDonald's for breakfast, nor did I feel like just sitting around auto shop and watching a snowy television screen.  So I walked, and with de Sade in purse, sat comfortably in Cabin Coffee Espresso for some caffeine. The interior was pretty dark- my eyes had a hard time transitioning from sunshine to oil lantern lighting, but they had some \"hip\" tunes on play.   I ordered the large Mexican Mocha Latte...not bad. The coffee proved a lot more robust than Starbucks. Cinnamon lingered on my palate well after I had finished my drink. Even caught some hints of cayenne...that may have enhanced that certain \"spice\"...but I'm sure that was just psychological.   Anyway...good place for coffees. They've got a pretty extensive list of flavors from classic to exotic. I'll have to update upon my next visit."}
{"text":"What a cute little coffee shop! Definitely unique in its decor and atmosphere. I got a latte and it was delicious. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Skip Starbucks and go to Cabin Coffee.  Great local spot!  I only review places that I rate 5 stars..."}
{"text":"The perfect substitute for Starbucks. Great staff an awesome environment! Tasty beverages with more natural ingredients and flavor than the competition. A little on the pricy side. But worth it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! food is yummy coffee is great and atmosphere is amazing. There are coloring books for the kids to use and board games to play."}
{"text":"Hey hey Hey it's Analynn this cozy little coffee spot is five stars from coffee drinks, smoothies right down to the sandwiches and salads . Great place to study and do homework, meet for book club, chat it up with your BFF !!! Don't take my word for it go try it out for yourself and let me know what you think"}
{"text":"Was completely shocked today when the girl serving us was wearing flip flops!!! Then not one but two more workers including the person who cooked our food was also wearing flip flops! In the kitchen!The one cooking was wearing a long t shirt, so it looked like she had no shorts on underneath.I am all for casual but....this is a major health code violation.Please pull it together, we like The Cabin but not this way."}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee place that seems to stay consistently busy. The staff was very nice and the decor very fun and creative. They have a lot of board games as well which can make for a fun game night.   I ordered an iced Lumberjack which was mocha and coconut. It was good. It wasn't spectacular and her than the name, it's not super original but all in all, this is a cute and tucked away little place. Be aware though that space is a premium as this is so busy. That alone is a good sign."}
{"text":"Visited with my sister. We both liked the look and feel of Cabin Coffee. I had the Mexican Mocha because of all the positive reviews, I wasn't disappointed. Sister had some vanilla mic that had a bear name theme to it. She enjoyed her coffee as well. We shared a bagel with tomato and avocado. It's was tasty, took just a tad long to receive but was worth it. They had quite a few customers coming in so could account for the wait.   We would definitely go back when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Visited here today for some coffee with my little ones.  Very nice staff, relaxing atmosphere, and the coffee was great.  Ordered a Cabin Late with extra espresso shot & a cookie for my little guy.  Less than $5.  *Cookie was not in house made*    The bathrooms were clean and the games were fun to play while enjoying this morning date with my kiddos.  :)"}
{"text":"My favorite local coffee spot. Perfect place to get work done or host a small meeting. Their veggie panini is on point! Also love their Mexican mocha."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff! The Batista's are always sweet & helpful. The Halloween drinks are great! Dracula, Frankenstein & Boo Buster are worth a try!!!"}
{"text":"I love the delicious, fresh baked treats that line the counter.  The coffee has a pleasant, smooth flavor (not bitter) and gets served a perfectly hot, yet drinkable temperature.  All of this is wonderful, but the best part is the comfortable, at-home Northwoods themed environment, complete with a beautiful stone fireplace, comfortable chairs & couches, and a wide variety of board games begging to be played!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's small and quaint and dark like a cabin and the food is good. It's a good coeorking space but there's only a very very few tables, and their almost always the.  The green juice wasn't very good, but I think it had Stevia or something in it? Next time I will ask for regular sugar in the raw. Or nothing at all. The staff is friendly and it is fairly quiet. Just low murmur talking. Not a good place to bring loud kids, as many people rely on this place as a working space."}
{"text":"Good local coffee joint.  I was looking for low carb, which they did not have, but the wholewheat beagle was good and there are lots of other sandwich type options.  The coffee was smooth and the service was friendly.    There is no drive-through and the parking can be an issue.  All in all its a good place to meet a friend or for extraverts to read a book.  Why drive to Flagstaff when there is a cabin at 67th Av. & Deer Valley?"}
{"text":"I've been going to Cabin Coffee for over tree years now it has been my go to quiet haven, as I walk in I am immediately greeted. My morning drink of choice is hot mocha as I intermingle with Janice the owner and her friendly staff and the local usual's that know me by first name basis, also the Cabin's muffins are amazing and they are home made.   The Cabin has a lot to offer from breakfast item's right down to lunch item's and a good verity of things, they also do have a few gluten free item, but not sure what they are. The ambiance of the Cabin is just that, a Cabin! kick your feet up or lay down and enjoy your quiet time."}
{"text":"I was staying a few miles away, needed coffee and some breakfast and ended up visiting this little gem! Coffee tasted good, they had oats for my breakfast and also service was with a smile and catered for my extremely fussy specifications!   Also ordered some take away breakfast sandwiches for the household, they all enjoyed the food and overall experience was 5*!   Oh also, the Cabin's decoration is really nice, the lights arent too bright, free wifi to use if you need it, comfy chairs spread around and a few couches plus stools and a bench. Providing various different seats means they have ensured that they can cater for a wide range of clientele. You need to open up your laptop and do work? They have a table and chair, want to sink into a couch and read a book? That's another option! Want to sit on a bench and have a chat with your group of friends? That's available too!   Lastly, you can always help yourself to a board game at the back of the shop and have some fun!"}
{"text":"It's a great spot. Even though it was crowded at 3:30pm! Comfy, dark, price is ok, people are nice and coffee was amazing. I'm having a hard time to find a good coffee since I moved to AZ. But I ordered a Cabin Coffee (French) and no regrets at all.  I tried the blueberry muffin but it wasn't very good. Unfortunately :( Five starts!"}
{"text":"Liking this place so far! Good iced mocha, friendly baristas, and good juju all around. They have free wi-fi and the place feels warm and friendly. I may have found a little cafe hangout much like the little coffeehouse on 65th I used to unwind in up in Seattle."}
{"text":"I live minutes from this place.  It has been there since the shopping center has opened and I've never been.  I went on a whim about 3 weeks ago, and I've probably been back 1/2 dozen times.  I like, no love, the Brown Bear or Lodge.  They have a good variety but not overwhelming.  Even got  a breakfast sandwich once and it was really good.  I am very impressed.  Pennies more than the chain place, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"I was hanging out around MRHS when I decided to grab some breakfast at this awesome little cafe. It was my first time visiting the Cabin Coffee Cafe and I must say, it won't be my last. The customer service here is exceptional. Good jobs to these young adults/ teenagers who were working at the time of my visit. A very nice young girl helped me picked out not only my amazing awesome omelet topped with cheese, ham, mushrooms, and spinach but as well as the vanilla-caramel iced coffee that suited me well. The interior design of this neat cafe does really look like a cabin. It is cozy, dim-lighted and extremely comfortable to relax at. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere is the real treat here. Small town feel and appeal, with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great teas, good food, and an awesome atmosphere. The only thing that keeps be from being a regular is their horrible WIFI when I do go there I have to use my own hotspot. You get 2-3 Mbps down and I've never gotten more than 0.5 Mbps up which is unusable as even having one browser tab open it is to painful to use for just basic email and web surfing I couldn't imagine trying to stream a low quality video."}
{"text":"I ordered the Honey Bear which is espresso, half and half, and honey. It was absolutely delicious. My friend got their green tea which she enjoyed as well. There's plenty of seating inside (with couches! :) ) as well as some seating outside. They have a large selection of coffee choices to choose from (so it was very hard for me to decide what to get) but I was very glad to have ordered the Honey Bear! The restrooms are very large and clean and it as well as the entire place was decorated as a cabin: wood, stone, chimney, etc. I felt like I was in Lake Tahoe at a Ski resort. Very cute. The coffee as well as service and atmosphere were wonderful!  No complaints. It was a very pleasant experience. :)"}
{"text":"Great lattes and iced teas. I recommend the Matt & Traci or Black Forest. The breakfast sandwiches are great (and huge) too."}
{"text":"I came back for another visit and ordered their signature panini and it was delicious! I also really like the spinach salad that it comes with as well. Hands down one of my favorite coffee shops in AZ!"}
{"text":"My usual coffee shop was packed so I used yelp and found this place. Great french roast and if you like flavored coffee/not black coffee, they have a huge variety. Quiet, comfy ambience. Will make this my go to place now!"}
{"text":"I've been on a bit of a journey recently and have been attempting to try as many coffee shops in the area as possible. So far this one is a personal favorite. I almost gave it one star to keep people away.   The coffee (I got the chai specifically) was some of the best I've had. It's super cozy (which can be a downside because a couple people came into the place and left right away). There are only a few seats and the Sunday I came, it was packed with college students. Great aesthetic. Chill vibe. Lots of coffee options. Felt like home"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite local coffee house.  Their coffee is top notch and food is just as amazing.  My favorites are the Maple Leaf (maple/caramel latte) and a simple iced vanilla latte in the summer.   Food-wise the egg croissants are amazing and lunch is just as good.   Great staff and great service."}
{"text":"I came across this online & now it's one of my favorite places. The Mexican Mocha blended with almond milk is AMAZING! It's the perfect blend of cinnamon & nutmeg & mocha. That's the first drink I've tried, and the other day I wanted to \"try\" it & I realized this is my favorite drink! I also tried there breakfast burritos without bacon and it was great."}
{"text":"One of my go-to coffee houses due to location and their lavender iced coffee I can't seem to resist!  Decor is fun and cabin themed. It always makes me feel at home in the woods. Noise level is quite loud and makes it slightly difficult to get work done without some headphones in. Staff is friendly and if you are trying a new combination they are willing to change it if it's too sweet or not enough.  I always enjoy the chalk quote board near the restrooms. Make sure you stop to read some..they are very inspiring. They also have some fun board games to play over your coffee! So it's a great spot to enjoy a coffee and friends while playing a board game."}
{"text":"This place is cool and cozy!  Got the cabin feel to sit back and enjoy some coffee."}
{"text":"Really great coffee cafe! I've been a few times and the service is always very friendly and warm. Best coffee in the area. I'm relatively simple and always get an americano. Have never been disappointed. Would definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this place! So quaint, great customer service too! They have tons of flavors for your latte, i like the toasted marshmallow. Also try the CTA Bagel - everything bagel with cream cheese tomato and avocado! Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Oh, Yum...the best word for their coffee, food, service and atmosphere. It's a great, homey and comfortable place for the best coffee around. So much better than the chain coffee - smooth and delicious. I LOVE coffee and I love this place.   I hadn't been in a while, but woke up to a rainy Phoenix morning and wanted a hot white mocha in the worst way. Walked in to no waiting and out the door in minutes with coffee and muffins in my hand. Service was friendly with the two young guys working there. Took the coffee home to my 'doubtful' sweetie and he agreed - loves it! You have another convert.   Thanks for bringing this great little business to our corner of the world."}
{"text":"I love the vibe here. I'm easy to please though as I'm not a coffee aficionado."}
{"text":"Went here with my 2yr old and husband on a Saturday morning. Our breakfast sandwiches were great.  So was our coffee and smoothies. We loved the atmosphere and the staff was extremely nice.  We were so overwhelmed with all the great choices that we didn't know what to order first."}
{"text":"I LOVE this little gem. One day my sister and i went on yelp because we wanted to find a little mom and pop coffee shop. We decided to give them a try and now we are hooked! Their coffee is to die for. My favorite is the caramel bear trap. They also have homemade goodies and sandwiches. The employees are always attentive and helpful. It has such a great atmosphere. If you're looking for a new little coffee shop to call your home, this is the one."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee! The first time the wife and i walked into this coffee shop we were impressed and how beautifully decorated this joint was. The staff is very nice and helpful, the ladies behind the counter were pretty hot.   we were served quickly and their coffee is outstanding, and its awesome when you're hungover!"}
{"text":"If we had half stars, I'd have probably gone 3.5, but 3 felt too harsh - I really did enjoy Cabin Coffee!   I was so excited to try a local coffee shop, hoping to find a new favorite spot to occasionally work, hang out and get my caffeine fix.   While I *adore* the decor, vibe, and great seating options, the coffee itself was a little underwhelming. That's not to say it was bad - it just wasn't great/memorable. I had a medium iced white chocolate latte, and it had a good flavor but it just wasn't very strongly coffee flavored at all. Maybe next time I'd ask for an extra shot it in.   I will definitely be back, because they had such great seating options and just a really cool mellow vibe, but I needz mah caffeine fix, too!"}
{"text":"I love this place and the small town vibe it creates. Their coffee is great, and so are their cheese danishes!!! Coffee drive thrus might be on every corner but this place is well worth going a little out of your way!"}
{"text":"Cortado was great, loved the environment, cool tv. Fiancé said her matcha wasn't great but I enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!"}
{"text":"Very homey, quiet, good coffee, great staff.   Not sure that they actually cook there own stuff. Saw some very similar items in the Fry's grocery store next door? Disappointed to see those items were marked up by about 300%.  In any event I will be back for the coffee and the people but not the food."}
{"text":"Coffee is my generation's \"get up and go\" juice.  I'm not a fan of energy drinks or gels.  Coffee is my high-octane fuel of choice.  Cabin Coffee Cafe does coffee right.  They feature a drink called Mexican Mocha which is one of my favorites.  I don't know exactly what's in it, but it tastes good and gets me going and that's what I care about.  They also do some pretty tasty breakfast sandwiches that are fairly easy on the wallet  When you get a little tired of the \"green circle,\" check out an independent coffee house - Cabin Coffee Cafe is one of the good ones.  Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"There is great atmosphere and great coffee! It is a very relaxing setting. It is wifi friendly and conversation encouraging lay out of the coffee shop."}
{"text":"This is the cutest, coziest, and most welcoming coffee shop.  The staff was so incredibly friendly that they put you in a good mood even before you have your morning coffee.  I tend to get the iced coffee while my husband gets a regular drip.  It's not as strong as some coffee shops that serve darker brews, but I prefer it that way so I like the coffee.  There are plenty of seating options, but it might not be the best place if you have a large group of more than 6 people.  They have some board games, couches, a TV, and some tables/chairs to lounge and sip on your coffee.  Everytime I walk in there it feels like Christmas."}
{"text":"I am so lucky to live right next to what could possibly be the best coffee house in Arizona. I say this without a drop of sarcasm - Cabin Coffee makes a Mexican Mocha to DIE for, or at least run through the street naked with a sombrero on yelling \"ARRRIBA!!!\".    Their decor is very cozy and lodge-like, with big leather chairs and lanterns and rustic decor, and they even display local photographers' work for sale. Someone has always left a newspaper hanging around to read.  The breakfast croissant sandwiches are amazing, I split the ham and cheese one with my dog before going to the dog park on Sunday mornings when we are awake enough to remember to stop in for coffee.  The coffee drinks are always made with that extra flair (those swirly little deisgns on the foam on top of your drink!) which I love, what can I say, I am a girly girl at heart and those things are almost like a drink wearing a pair of great heels!  The only thing that keeps this from being a five star place is that there always seem to be kids in here (which,ok, I dont dislike ALL kids, I have one who I truly adore, but when I am barely awake and my tolerance level is at its lowest, I don't need to hear someone shout at Cassidy or Kennedy or McKenna or whatever last name their kids are called fifty times before I have my hands around my hot spicy Mexican Mocha) so despite the kid-friendliness of the place I still absolutely love it. The price I pay for living in \"stay at home mom Paradise\" I guess. They do have a funny sign at the register that reads \"unattended Children will be given a Puppy and Espresso\" which is amusing and ironic at the same time. Amusing because of the obvious message, but ironic because, again, there are often a passel of semi-unattended kids bopping around.   They also have gift cards and I tell ya, it wouldnt be half bad to get a gift card from here."}
{"text":"Cabin Coffee is right down the street from my house. I do have to say - parking is often difficult, however their food and coffee makes it worth the parking struggle. Coffee is delightful, perfectly roasted, just the right amount of flavoring - YUM!!! I have only been there a few times so far so have only tried a limited amount of their food items, but the grilled cheese avocado (I think that is what I had the first time) was delicious, very moist and fresh pastries...we haven't been disappointed yet :) Staff is always super sweet as well, and they will all help you if you are indecisive (firsthand knowledge, lol)"}
{"text":"Most of the time I use yelp when I'm not aware of places to eat, I am a contractor and travel around the valley and hate wasting my time at places to eat without some sort of investigation, but I just walked right into his wife felt like I walked into a lodge up in the Swiss Alps. The food is fresh and delicious in the place has a great feeling you just want to hang out here all day"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere! Great coffee! Great food! Great people! The big kid grilled cheese is ah-mazing... its 7am and I'm already craving one! We come here regularly and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, decent prices, love the atmosphere.  Only complaint was that the Wi-Fi is a bit spotty.  I found a new study spot =)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite coffee shop in the valley! The baristas remember us and are very friendly. The drinks are perfect most of the time and the wait is generally short. We have moved out of state but every time we visit we still make sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"As the name implies, it has the feel and look of a cabin inside.  Too bad the exterior is just a strip mall, which is the motif most of phoenix and its suburbs have adopted.  And wouldn't it be cozy if it snowed outside?  Coffee is great and the prices are reasonable, ranging from $1.65 to $4.95.  They do have small food selections for breakfast and lunch.  Just a few salads and breakfast sandwiches.  I have not had food their though so cannot judge it.  Wifi does seem a bit touchy, but it is a Nice place to relax and read your book with a cup of good coffee."}
{"text":"If you are in the area, this is the best place to get your coffee. I have become a regular at Cabin Coffee because of their outstanding customer service and delicious coffee and espresso drinks. Some of the baristas are so kind to even remember my name and drink order. My favorite is the Iced Red Eye (Cold brew + shot of espresso) with vanilla and a little bit of cream-SO good. I don't buy food often there but when I have occasionally I always enjoy it, their pastries and baked goods are outstanding.  Usually it's a pretty quiet coffee shop where you can go to study, read or chat up with a friend."}
{"text":"I was in town looking for a coffee shop to get work done at, and this was it! It definitely has a productive vibe as everyone has their laptops and notes busted out and open.  As the name goes, the atmosphere of this place was like a little cabin. The atmosphere was quiet enough to focus, the lights were a little dimmer which might make it hard to stay awake if you're running low on caffeine. Good thing they have loads of coffee to remedy that! They also have a great selection for food- breakfast and lunch.   This place has all you need to crank out work."}
{"text":"Always great coffee and friendly staff.  The inside is a very relaxed comfortable welcoming setting.  Highly recommend to stop by if you want something a little different then the main stream coffee shops."}
{"text":"It is as good as it gets.   For me, I want a good cup of black coffee. Nothing fancy. That is what my wife and I ordered. The coffee was hot and the dark roast had a great flavor.   Even though we were here on vacation and \"not a local,\" Cabin Coffee didn't discriminate.  The service was very friendly and the seats comfortable.  The free wifi was an added bonus.  My wife fired up her work computer and checked her email.  While she was working (aren't we supposed to be on vacation ?) I ordered a cranberry muffin. Wow!  It was really good.  Thank you for a good start to our morning!"}
{"text":"Very cozy little hidden gem of s coffeehouse....but wait!! they have breakfast burritos( more of a panini burrito actually) and locally baked danish, cookies and mini coffeecakes. Service is very quick and friendly. Definitely worth the trip to find it in a strip mall."}
{"text":"After countless visits, I'm considering forgoing Starbucks and other chain stores. Cabin Coffee Lounge exemplifies what a coffee shop experience ought to be.   Coffee: I've had most of their drip coffees, and they've all been good. The specialty drinks are all good as well! They've got cool names for all their drinks and unlike most coffee shops, they have all syrups all year around! I haven't had their tea, but their smoothies are good as well.   Atmosphere: it's a great set up in there! There are leather chairs, and nice tables to sit at as well. Free wifi is always a plus as well. The air is always down cool - a huge plus for the baking temps outside. They have a fireplace for the wintertime. Also, they have TV on at most times. It's either ESPN or world news.   Staff: always friendly, professional and ready to serve!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, local coffee shop, fantastic ambiance, great service and awesome beverages"}
{"text":"Went with a friend - super cozy environment and the staff was friendly and helpful. Coffee was great."}
{"text":"Cute coffee place located right near work, so I stop by for an iced chai and a muffin before my morning shift. The staff is super friendly and knows my order by heart, which I love. Pretty good chai, too! Not the best but much better than some other places, and when it's made like soy, it still tastes spicy and delicious (unlike a chai I had at Cartel which tasted purely like soy, super disappointing). I haven't tried their Avalanches yet, but I really want to, they look really good. Prices are decent too, about $5 for a medium chai and a delicious muffin.   I think the decor is cute too, looks like it belongs up north in Flagstaff or Sedona.  All in all, if you're in the area, definitely stop by, but I wouldn't necessarily go far out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Old log cabin feel, good coffee with a great coffee menu.  Food is decent enough.  The staff is young and trendy, a bunch of fun people.   When on the north side of town I will stop.here for my caffeine fix every time."}
{"text":"Very nice coffee shop.  The environment and furnishings are warm and comfortable, really quiet.  The service was friendly and fast.  Coffee is great and done well.  I'll go again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food and drinks! The atmosphere makes you feel like you are in a mountain town. The employees are also extremely nice and wonderful to deal with. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I love me some coffee. The french roast brew is perfect for surviving a long day of work. If you want something sweet, order the iced raspberry mocha. Just the right amount of sweetness without tasting like you're drinking syrup. The muffins are moist and delicious. The spinach salad here is surprisingly amazing (yes, they make spinach salad at this coffee place). The best part about this place? It is not full of hipsters and college students who hog all the decent seating and never leave. I can't wait to go back to try all of the other drinks offered."}
{"text":"My first time here and I like it! Huge selection of drinks and serve hot brunch sandwiches and cold ones. As well as pastries. I will definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"This place is a true gem. Cozy and relaxing and a great escape from the heat and outside world. Very friendly staff, comfortable atmosphere and yummy food and coffee. The shakes are great too!"}
{"text":"Been going here since high school and I can't believe I just thought to review it. Its like my cabin away from cabin. Such a great cup of coffee, great prices, and the BEST croissant sandwiches- all of them are good! The staff isn't over the top or fake which is nice. I would recommend an Iced Brown Bear, this is my favorite coffee drink ever and no other coffee companies version is as good. Also they have the best atmosphere so cozy and relaxing.   Heads up, after talking to some baristas about the job I learned that tips are a part of their wages (like servers) so I try to drop a dollar or what I can give into the jar when I have it, cause I know they are always working hard in there and making good quality food and drink!"}
{"text":"I love every coffee I try here. I don't get stuck on one for too long before trying another... Love the atmosphere and that it is like being in a friends cabin just hanging out."}
{"text":"Unassuming little spot in a strip mall (seems like the best places to eat in AZ are) next to Fry's. Ordered an iced coffee with sugar free coconut syrup, sugar free mocha sauce, and unsweetened almond milk...PERFECT! I gulped it down and got one for the road. I also appreciate the fact that they got my slightly annoying order correct 1st try.  Hubby and I got the chicken salad croissant and a ham, cheese, spinach and mushroom omelet. Both were fresh and delicious. Eggs were fluffy. Salsa was really good too.  Customer service was warm and friendly. I think the cabin theme is kinda cheesy and unnecessary (seriously take down those ugly icicle lights or whatever they are) but the quality of the food and coffee and top notch customer service will keep me coming back. Great find!"}
{"text":"I love cabin coffee!!! So much better than Starbucks in so many ways.  The coffee flavor is always on point no matter which drink you choose.  I love the matt and traci or the coconut and caramel avalanche.  Their drinks are a little sweeter so I usually add a shot of espresso to even it out.  They also have almond milk which is great since I'm not a fan of soy.  Try cabin coffee you will not regret it!  Great local spot ;)"}
{"text":"I go to Cabin Coffee almost every day of the week. The employees are absolutely fantastic, they know me by name and know my regular order. I love the food, especially the summer salad, hummus platter, and yogurt parfait. If you aren't sure what you want, each employee is great at recommendations. Such a fun environment with great people and an awesome owner. I would recommend Cabin to everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing service, great cold brew, nice music, great atmosphere, tasty panini. I recommend coming. It's the perfect place for a college student to do homework after church on Sundays."}
{"text":"The have new and unique coffee combinations. Pastrys are good and the sandwitches are made fresh. I am not a parfet kinda guy but I do recomend there yogurt parfet. It has everything in it. Best coffee shop in that area."}
{"text":"Oh so cute! We came in at closing and they still served us. Such a fun environment for hangouts and homework. Definitely going back. Yum."}
{"text":"A great place to support local business.   I hope they are supported just the same with the addition of a newly built Starbucks in the same plaza.  Great service,  Love to support local business."}
{"text":"This place is right my my house and I am here at least once a month to hang out with a friend. It is a comfortable mom and pop coffee shop and almost always seems to have activity while not being so busy you don't want to hang out.  Honestly, I go to Starbucks more often but that is only because of their drive through and my lack of time to hang out and enjoy the coffee. Given a choice, I'd hang out at Cabin Coffee."}
{"text":"Really nice and cozy little place with a outdoorsey and Christmasy feel. It has wifi, board games, fun signs all over to read, tables to sit at or comfy couches and chairs to chilax in! This would definitely be a nice place to cuddle up with a good book and hang out for a while!!!  The first time i came here i got a chicken crossaint sandwich, it was delicious"}
{"text":"I loved my experience at Cabin Coffee! Great atmosphere, and wonderful service. I had the green shake, which was recommended by one of the staff members,  and it was very well made and was also affordable. I can't wait to head back!!!"}
{"text":"We stop by this place occasionally to try some of their drinks. Their Mexican Mocha, in particular, is fairly decent. The place has a very lodge-like vibe to to. It's often what I imagined Flagstaff would be like - even though it's far from it realistically.  I'll never forget the time we walked in here at 6:55pm. While going up to the counter, the guy gave us a dirty look while grumbling, \"We close in five minutes.\" Umm...okay? So, are you implying that we shouldn't have come here and should leave? Or that we should simply hurry up and order our drinks so YOU can leave? Next time, if you don't want customers coming in, I've found that locks work pretty well for these situations.  I'd still recommend their Mexican Mocha - just at earlier hours of the day."}
{"text":"Love how cozy the atmosphere is! Nice and quite to study and friendly helpful staff! The lady who took my order knew exactly what I wanted based on what I liked. I don't like my coffee like a sweet chocolate milk with a ton of sugar like Starbucks. I will definitely be back to chill at this cool spot."}
{"text":"Close to the GCC school, this coffee shop has everything you want. It has couches to relax and tables to work on (with plenty outlets for laptops). The coffee was delicious! I believe my drink was called hidden trail and it had a great volume in flavoring and coffee. The cabin feel of this place truly makes it yet another hidden treasure. It was non-chillant and accomadating. The service was good too, very attentive and informative. One of my favorite places to work at with a good cup of coffee in my hand."}
{"text":"Super cozy little coffee joint close to home. I absolutely love the rusticness of the decor.  Staff is always friendly and the drinks are delicious!  They have a good looking food menu and plenty of sweet treats, but I have yet to have a meal here."}
{"text":"Great place! Wonderful service, relaxing atmosphere,  cute decor. I had a caramel mocha avalanche with an extra shot of espresso and it was the best coffee eeeevvveerrrr!! Cant wait have another!"}
{"text":"Ok I had coffee and cappuccino and they were both A+ . My husband and I tried to sit and relax there but the seating is not the most comfortable place!! But this grade is strictly for coffee.Seating area is too small!"}
{"text":"Simple review- incredible staff, local mom & pop shop, great coffee.  Detailed review- I had been looking for a good coffee shop to study at for quite some time, a friend had always said great things about this place. I decided to google it and see where it was at and turns out, it's super close to my house! I've been here almost everyday for the last 3 weeks, sounds crazy but I am taking an online class and this place is the only place i can get anything done. They have plenty of seating, board games if you feel like playing, and free wifi! I don't usually like the taste of coffee (more of a sugar and cream with a splash of coffee lol) but my favorite is The Trek! You can taste the coffee but it isn't over the top. The food is also delicious. I've tried the omelette and the panini, both so good! They have great teas and the smoothies are good too. The staff is laid back, still professional. They are very welcoming which is nice. Overall an amazing place, highly suggest you check it out!"}
{"text":"I thought I would try a new local shop today, and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered a \"Lumberjack\" I think is what it's called. I asked for a suggestion as it was my first time, and it tasted great. The atmosphere is my favorite part. It's quiet, easy to study or hang out with friends. The cabin theme is really cool, and done well. Price is pretty average for a specialty coffee. Friendly, non-overwhelming, staff. Overall, I'd recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"So relaxing to drop by the wonderful neighborhood coffee shop where the beans are not burnt and the lattes are always delicious.  The owner, Daveney, has created a warm community coffee shop where you can relax with your kids (she even has a discrete basket of toys to help you entertain toddlers while you enjoy your java.)  Her lunch panini's are second to none with the pefect size side salad.  I love the Green Pomagranate Iced Tea....the tunes are always fun that are playing in the backgroud....ohhhhhh, and the muffins cranberry or chocolate chip absolutely melt in your mouth.  Did I mention the black & white cookies, YUMMY!  Then again, if you're not in the mood for caffine (rare occurance for me) try their orange creamsicle smoothie.  It will remind you of your childhood."}
{"text":"Brief: Good coffee, great people, delicious homemade sandwiches and fantastic atmosphere.  First of all, they have free wifi, food, and good coffee, so before going into a deep review, those qualities already make for a great experience. But to be more specific on the topic requires a little walkthrough:  You walk into this small unassuming coffee shop, nestled between a children's clothing store and scrap-booking shop in the corner of a typical suburban supermarket shopping center, and you enter into a world of fantastically quaint decorations miming that of a rural cabin. The walls are lined with shelves holding old wooden and metal trinkets, a fireplace accents a seating area and a two-man crosscut saw adorns the wall just opposite the register. The aroma is that of sweet coffee and home. You're greeted with a welcome smile from the barista and immediately you're taken aback by the complexity of the menu. The colorful combinations of syrups, sauces and drink types tantalizes your imagination. You make your order and in no time, you have your drink in hand and you savor every last drop of espresso-y goodness.  *snaps fingers* O.K., now that I've broken your coffee trance, let's review the food and drinks at hand:   The food is homemade, the ingredients are fresh and most importantly, the chicken salad is made in house and is FANTASTIC. The breakfast croissants are delicious and just about every pastry on display is mouth-wateringly-alluring. The pastries are delivered fresh from New York West Pastry and Bake shop.  More importantly (in my coffee-guzzling opinion), the coffee beans are fresh-roasted and delivered twice weekly from Riviera Coffee out of Chandler and the varieties they offer generally include fair trade coffees. I must say, for anyone used to the gritty bold charcoal taste of Starbucks brewed coffees (even their so called light roasts), the Ethiopian, Peru, Costa Rican or Guatemalan brewed coffees here at Cabin Coffee will absolutely explode with floral notes and caramely sweet chocolate body that you've never experienced before. Every coffee has its own unique taste and floral sweetness (other than French Roast - an overly dark-roasted charcoal-fest, often favored by those who enjoy typically dark-roasted Seattle style coffees). Try some brewed coffee, GET THE LIGHTER ROAST and try, for once to drink it without cream or sugar. Do it, you might just find the complexities of actually good coffee more enjoyable than the single-sidedness of half-n-half and sugar.  Most importantly... the espresso! This is a shop with a consistently good espresso (not mind numbingly amazing, but good) and a mind for delivering quality espresso based beverages. Try a double if you're bold. Try a Cafe con Panna for a lovely after meal espresso-y dessert. Definitely try an americano or cappuccino. And for those of you who are afraid of coffee without sweeteners - Cabin Coffee has a plethora of Torani flavored syrups. End result, good coffee that any Starbucks drinker can upgrade to and feel confident that their drink truly does rock their socks.  Speaking of Torani Flavored Syrups, Cabin Coffee can create just about any concoction you can imagine in their blenders. The avalanches here put Frappuchinos to shame. Try the mexican mocha avalanche; cinnamon and chocolate never tasted so good.  Ultimately, I love this coffee shop. It's not the BEST coffee in Arizona, but its really darn GOOD. The atmosphere is quaint and homey and it's a great place to study or hang out and get away from the house. The staff is nice and helpful and the drinks and food are delicious. Stop by, and if you run into Janice, the owner... make sure you tell her how great a job she's doing keeping this place running so strong."}
{"text":"A friendly destination almost every day. Service with a smile and a welcome word. The entire staff is focused on service. I get the Salty Sombrero - Mexican mocha with a squirt of salted caramel syrup. Really different and very good for a change."}
{"text":"Certainly a cool place. I absolutely hate breakfast sandwiches, my fiance ordered some egg, bacon, sausage something sandwich, she convinced me to try it and im glad I did, it was awesome."}
{"text":"I love the ambience here and that they have almond milk as an alternative to dairy milk.   The omelets are tasty too.   Definitely a great place to bring my laptop and get some work done too.   Very comfortable and inviting, courteous staff."}
{"text":"I hope this place sticks around. It's a cute relaxing cabin feel too it and the employees and always friendly. Their smoothies are very good and the avalanches are really good too. my drink of choice that i always get is just a plain ole iced vanilla latte and its better than starbucks =]"}
{"text":"Omelette sandwiches are awesome. Coffee and smoothies are also great. Service has been equally good every time I've been here. My last visit, the young man working the counter looked like he saw me juggling my young son and even brought our food and beverages over to the table rather than setting it on the counter for me to pick up. It was above and beyond my expectation and was greatly appreciated at that moment.   40+ visits here in the last few years and never a bad experience. Great record as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Since my original study spot somehow became the new \"it\" spot, I hunted for a new study spot and stumbled over Cabin Coffee Cafe. It wasn't TOO incredibly far from my place so I decided to head out and check things out. They have a large variety of coffee, lattes and tea beverages in addition to different food items! They also have ample seating and tables for parties who just want to sit and talk and for students/professionals who need to get work done. I tried the Mark and Traci latte (caramel and vanilla) with Almond Milk and was definitely impressed. Not too sweet and perfectly balanced with the espresso shot. Too good.  The one quirk about this place is that the decor is a bit on the odd side. They definitely have the cabin, outdoorsy, forest theme going, but it also has some Christmas and 4th of July decorations going on. Oh and some inspirational quotes and artwork hanging around. Though it is a bit odd and doesn't seem like it would mesh well together, it somehow oddly works for Cabin Coffee Cafe. Definitely found my new favorite study spot."}
{"text":"I needed to grab breakfast after a very early meeting and found this place on Yelp. It's located in the frys shopping center.. when you first walk in it takes a minute to adjust to how dark it is.. its cozy once you're there for five seconds .. the decor is cabin theme.  Lots of people meeting and working .. They have free wi-fi   I ordered the bacon, egg, cheese croissant sandwich (no cheese) and a large coffee au-lait with almond milk (.60c more for \"other\" milk options) for a reasonable $8.95.  I thought the sandwich had too much egg and the egg was overdone .. the bacon and buttery croissant were delicious.. the coffee was ok not the best I've had and the splash of almond milk doesn't warrant a $.60 upcharge.. it needed more milk.. the coffee was pretty strong though."}
{"text":"I get a lot of work done here.   They also have the BEST espresso ever. I've been an iced americano drinker for about 10 years now, and the Cabin's americano is the ONLY one that I truly love. I literally crave it. It blows Starbucks out of the water.   Not to mention their super friendly, never annoying, but still cheery baristas, paired with a cozy Midwest feel. I love it."}
{"text":"Favorite coffee place in all of AZ! The staff is wonderful and so sweet, they are always so happy to be working and you never see anyone that looks like they hate being here! They have the best drinks and I have never been disappointed with whichever drink they make me! I've never beens so happy and felt so welcome as much as I do here!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Vanilla Chai Latte that ended up tasting a bit watery with a very tiny hint of vanilla. It was pretty disappointing. My sisters opted for The Lodge - one got it hot and one got it cold. Those drinks came out good, but I think it needed a bit more mint flavor. I did appreciate that they didn't make the hot chocolate too hot because it was for my little nephew. That's great service! I also got a B&W cookie, which ended up being pretty disappointing. If you've ever had one in NY, then you'll understand my disappointment. It's not authentic. I thought the drinks overall were just okay."}
{"text":"There are 365 days in a year, and I am at Cabin Coffee for about 358 of them. I love this place! Every morning all the girls (and occasionally guys) get my ridiculous drink created with perfection and a great attitude! You will not find a better cup of caffeinated beverage then Cabin Coffee. And literally everything is good here. From my daily 5 shot espresso (which by the way is the smoothest and richest espresso I have ever had) to the \"honey bear\" or \"maple leaf\" lattes and even the amazing sweet treats like those yummy sticky buns. If you live in the north west valley and haven't been to Cabin Coffee then you need to. Go get that coffee right now! You will be treated with a great cup of joe   and an awesome and cozy environment, provided by an fantastic staff of baristas! Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I like cabin coffee. Its a nice hidden place where I can go and have a quiet cup of coffee and talk with a friend. It's not a hang out for HS kids. It has a nice Cabin feel to it and the staff is friendly. Oh, PS the drinks are tasty and interesting. the Coffee is always good. I drink it black so if it's been sitting there past it's peak, it's easy to tell but, I have never had that experience there. It's just a nice relaxing place to read the paper, catch up on email or chat w/ friends. I have not had any food there but they look very tempting.  I give Cabin Coffee an 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"The Cabin has a cool interior just like you would think, it looks like a cabin! The coffee is pretty decent and they have some yummy breakfast croissants. We usually go here when we don't feel like driving down town since its the closest coffee house that tastes good. Would recommend trying if staying local."}
{"text":"Glad I searched for a local coffee shop near me. Wanted to try something different then Starbucks or Coffee Bean. Easy to find in the shopping center there. Stopped in on my way to work and grabbed a latte. Was good. The place was busy and looked inviting. Will need to go back and get an Americano to really taste the espresso; look forward to helping out a small business and to try the mexican mocha."}
{"text":"Love this little neighborhood, family owned coffee house. Its nestled in the frys shopping center so quaintly decorated like a cozy cabin.  We have met so many nice people there for small meetings, studying or social meetings. The coffee drinks are the best I have had in Phoenix. I will continue to support this small. Uisness. Also the omelets, salads and pastries are deliscous!"}
{"text":"First time here this morning...was greeted by a bubbly, friendly young lady. She cracked us up and was super helpful. She recommended different coffee drinks for us and explained the whole menu and where the coffee beans even come from. Super comfy log cabin atmosphere. I loved this place and will be going there for my morning coffee from now on!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice, very clean, staff are wonderful. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because the food was not that great it was just okay. I had an ultimate breakfast croissant. I wish they would have used real egg instead of egg substitute. However I am a college student and this environment is perfect for me to come sit down and get some school work done. I will be back and I'll try something new next time."}
{"text":"Love the Black Forest which is a raspberry mocha! Fun atmosphere and friendly staff too."}
{"text":"My second time here and I find it's quite pleasant! Comfortable, friendly, lots of menu options, and very chill. Super close to GCC North which is a plus for me. My new study spot for sure. Not as much conversation as some other coffee shops I have been to, everyone mostly keeps to themselves here it seems. (Probably since we're all doing homework, I suppose!) Certainly not something to fault this wonderful place for, though. Five stars.  PS. Bring a sweater, they do keep it pretty cold in here!"}
{"text":"Came to check this place out and we're happy that I  we did.  This place has great chill type atmosphere with the feeling of being in a cabin. The decore is on point and we're super stoked we found out about this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the cabin atmosphere is wonderful. I had a croissant breakfast sandwich and the bread was perfect, light and flaky. They make their own tea bags, so my hibiscus jasmine tea was really above and beyond. Very friendly staff, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I stopped because it had good reviews. Got the cold brew, it was good. Nice and strong, just like I like it. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Try the \"Matt and Traci,\" delicious!  (vanilla + caramel = yummy!)  I'm not a local, but on 5 different trips to Phoenix to visit family we've always returned to this coffee shop.  Usually, I'm more a fan of the Italian-style coffee shops, but this little place in an unassuming strip mall is pretty darn good.  The lake cabin style decor is cute and relaxing.  Never had a bad drink here, and I've tried all manners of coffee and espresso drinks.  Is it the best place ever?  No.  But is beat most chains by a mile."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Coffee is perfect and everyone is friendly. Relaxed environment... No hustling you through the line."}
{"text":"Was looking for a breakfast joint and found Cabin Coffee on Yelp.  It's really a coffee joint that has some food.  It was okay but I prefer a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite coffee shops ever. The decor and overall vibe of the place is so homey and warm. The coffees and teas are delicious and unique and their spinach and cheese croissant is to die for. In addition to their lovely treats, they have board games, reading material, and handmade jewelry for sale. The only drawbacks are that service can be really slow and it's gotten so crowded over the past couple years but hey I guess that's good for them! All in all, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Cabin coffee cafe is okay, to be honest. I come here because it is convenient, not because it's amazing. They do get my order right, however there have been times that my order has taken longer time than usual PLUS nowhere to sit. So I am left standing.. it's annoying."}
{"text":"Great cozy coffee shop with a true cabin feel, a killer cold brew, and delicious breakfast croissants. The peeps behind the counter are super nice, and there are couches, comfy chairs, tables, a kids table, and a few outside tables to enjoy your beverage. Thanks CC!"}
{"text":"The people serving here are very friendly. I think it may be a family run location/franchise perhaps. I got some sunflower shaped cookies, they are delicious. I also got a 3 meat trio sandwich, and boy do they pack that with meat.  Well worth the somewhat higher price for the sandwich.    I got an orange cream smoothie and it was fantastic.  I wish they sold tamales ala carte or by the dozen. They only sell it as a meal with chips/salsa.  Service is relatively quick, given that it is often busy there. A lot of kids hang out there drinking coffee and being trendy."}
{"text":"As the name suggests, this place has the log cabin feel that you'll find at small coffee houses in some of the western mountain states.  They have a very modest seating area, but coffee, espresso drinks, and light snacks are all reasonably priced and are much better than Starbucks.  It's easy to miss this location as it is tucked away in a FRY's strip mall on the SE corner of Happy Valley & 67th Ave."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop!! They have great tea, iced coffee and pastries. They're also really friendly and love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Very inviting and cozy ambience and atmosphere! The prices are not too shabby either.  Friendly baristas as well."}
{"text":"Great coffee and food which is the best reason to come. But once you're here, the environment is warm and inviting with plenty of spots to settle in and work or surf.  Food is also very good and reasonably priced. Enjoy!"}
