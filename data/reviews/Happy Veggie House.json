{"text":"This unassuming little eatery is inside a strip mall (City Plaza) in Chinatown.  I have seen it changed ownership a few times, but so far it looks like they're here to stay! I think most people come here for their lunch combos, but they actually have a full menu which sadly to say, I haven't tried yet.  I usually just come by to grab a lunch box to go - you can choose steamed rice or fried vermicelli, plus two or three items on the \"buffet\", plus their soup of the day and a spring roll - two items will set you back $7.95 + tax or three items will be $8.95 + tax.  Their selection is slightly different every day, but they always have the marinated gluten (in different flavors) and you can get those by the pound.  I like the variety and everything tastes so good! One day I will try their offerings off the full menu, or maybe I'll call ahead of time to order as their dishes are made to order so it'll take some time.  If you haven't tried Chinese vegetarian food before, this would be a good place to start.  Do note that they're cash only and does get pretty busy!"}
{"text":"This is tucked away in the food court in Chinatown of the building that Thai Tai anchors at the corner of 2nd Ave and Centre St.  The menu consists mainly of wheat gluten formed into various versions, some of it looking like pieces of pork chop to rolled up sheets of tofu. I had the veggie combo. The portions are extremely generous and the gluten varied from one looking like beef cubes, having some what of a texture of beef and flavoured with soy and some anise. There was also curried gluten, sweet and sour gluten and one that looked a little like a pork chop which was sliced up and even had the texture of meat. It was all surprisingly quite tasty. I'm not sure it will be part of my regular diet but surprisingly filling. I was full for hours. I didn't care much for the curried gluten or the sweet and sour but the other three were ok. They also have other offerings such as a vegetarian version of the rice cooked in a pot (like you get get dim sum with pork ribs or chicken) that looked interesting as well as some stir frys and noodle dishes. Small portion of the veggie combo was $8 including tax."}
{"text":"Great little food court outlet in Chinatown. One of my go-to's in the city for yummy Chinese food. It happens to be vegetarian but you won't notice if you order shanghai noodles or the seitan items. I'm not vegetarian but this place is solid."}
{"text":"This is a vegetarian food stall in a food court in Chinatown.   Everything is vegetarian here. They have a section of prepared food you can pick up right away.  I usually order off the menu.   You can order most dishes you would from a chinese restaurant but the vegetarian version. My favourite dishes here are the gluten (already prepared), shanghai noodles, stuffed tofu roll and the salted fish fried rice."}
{"text":"Fresh family run vegetarian Chinese cuisine in a little strip mall in Chinatown. Amazing prices and one of the only places you can get \" seitan\" ( aka the wheat meat) in this city. If you haven't tried seitan, if it's done well it completely mimicks the flavour and texture of meat. The best part ? All the protein without the fat content."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian food! I dine here about twice a week. Friendly staff and generous portions."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian food. Very fresh. Cantonese style which is rare to find in the United States. I am glad we get a chance to try it."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Calgary's Chinatown. It is located in a food court and they have vegetarian specials under $10. Had the veggie Tofu rolls (very generous portion and great for sharing). Also had the veggie wonton noodle soup (great way to warm up during the cold winter months.  Great selection of vegetarian and vegan Chinese  items"}
