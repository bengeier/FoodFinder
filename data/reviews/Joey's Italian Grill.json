{"text":"Stopped in to enjoy a night out with family. Food was stellar. Will be interesting to go back and visit the other restaurant they split the original restaurant to form. Our little guy loved his pizza . I loved my calzone and the rolls they bring out are phenomenal."}
{"text":"It was really good, waitress and staff were good, attentive...just a good meal and experience.  Had three entrees, cheese ravioli with meat ball, wings and a salad with salmon.  Salad was loaded with salmon, had to take it home.  Same with the left over dinner rolls...just the best food and people...frankly we were a little surprised. We'd go back here in a minute. We were treated like friends and, given that we weren't in the best mood after a funeral, this place cheered us up."}
{"text":"Our go to casual place in Chardon. I do not like to eat in the dinning room. It is very sterile and morgue like. The ticket is going into the bar area. Lively local crowd. You need to get the $5 LI iced tea (only when Emily is bar tending). There are always food and drink specials going on during Cleveland sporting events. My favorite is the chicken tenders. They also have great nightly specials. Our go to meals are the Glutton Free pizza and the walnut blue salad. Food is good but not great."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. We went in for lunch, not overly crowded, clean, great service and great food. We had the lunch specials and the food was prepared to our satisfaction. Also liked their kids menu- ordered a child's pizza and it was bigger than I expected it would be- plus delicious pizza sauce. Definitely will stop by next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant.  All of the Italian food is very good, especially calzones and pizza. Gluten free pizza is the best I have had. Salads are very good.  May have to wait during busy weekend times.  Sitting in the 'bar' area has a better ambiance."}
{"text":"We have been going to longos family restuarants for over 27 years.  We used to live by their lake shore Blvd location which was great.  We have since moved to concord and this is there closest location to us now.  I will say the food is outstanding and is the reason we go there.    The restaurant staff is very friendly and tend to be helpful.  The food typically comes out hot fresh and delicious.  The new remodel of the restaurant is also fantastic.  There take out staff/service is however not nearly as good or consistant. We on average every other order have a problem as in something missing or wrong.  Management will normally comp you for the meal or the missing item, however that's great for the one off incident but doesn't solve the problem that it keeps happening.  They really need to implement that they pack the order in front of you so you can verify that its correct. Or at least hire/train staff that its packed correctly. We've since stopped tipping there hostess staff due to the constant mix ups.   Overall good experiences and good food, however beware there take out service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a dinner with my family. We were promptly seated and greeted by our server. The portions were generous and the food was not as pricey as I expected it to be. I took one star off because the parking situation is not ideal, especially on  a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"A great family restraunt for Chardon. The parking lot almost needs to be expanded as there are always tons of vehicles every night. Food was good - I had a grouper sandwich and it was the freshest I've ever had. The restraunt was busy and the server did a good job taking care of the table. I'd go back again and again."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable and food was fast and great.  Rick the bartender did a super great job."}
{"text":"One thing always consistent every time we go- the bar staff really hustles.  Service is so great at the bar we try to sit there every time.  Their pizza is my favorite.  I would skip the fish and coleslaw during lent but Italian, which is their specialty, is pretty good."}
{"text":"Somehow our name got lost! Waited way too long and it wasn't that good either. Nobody offered anything other than \"sorry\". Won't be back for a long time!"}
{"text":"Meh. Nothing to write home about. Food was just okay. I had the lasagna, which was alright, but honestly didn't taste much different than Stouffers. Place is short on atmosphere, too. Loud and crowded together, no real decor in the room we were in. If you want better Italian, head over to Guidos in Chesterland."}
{"text":"Gross all three times. Two of three times we received uncooked chicken and the wait staff had the nerve to tell us that we must be tasting it wrong.  Service was horrible two of three times and food was a train wreck all three. Chicken fingers once cooked were all breading.   Prices are affordable, not sure how they're always busy, they must get someone's food right. Wouldn't recommend for much past pizza or simple things. Check meat before biting in."}
{"text":"Alway yummy, but they change the menu like twice a year and take away the buffalo chicken dip, which, by the way, is the best around.  Still great food, acceptable service (seems ever changing, but decent service)  I'm just sad my favorite is gone...again!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for comfort food. I've had several pasta dishes as well as pizza and mixed plates, and it's all great. The salads are tasty too - well worth a try for those who have never been."}
{"text":"We never go into eat at Joey's because the 2 times we tried we were not acknowledged by anyone after being seated so we left.  We however order takeout but when you call you have to be prepared because you never know what personality is going to answer the phone.  Sometimes we call and the person is friendly, then other times they are very snippy and snarky.  Also they will put you on hold almost every time you ask a question simply because they are not knowledgable about the menu etc.  We have alson not figured out why they insist on putting coleslaw in a meal box that is hot, it clearly heats it up and I personally do not like warm or hot coleslaw.  We have asked that they put it in a separate bag and only one time did they oblige us.  The burgers, the fried fish dinner and the fried shrimp dinner are good.  The rest of the food is okay.  Portions are a little small on some of the dinners.  The salads are hits and misses.  We get them and sometimes we get squishy tomatoes and wilted lettuce and when we add cheese we have had cheese that was hard and dried out mixed with cheese that was fine.  The blue cheese salad dressing on 1 occasion that I got was so turned it made my house stink so I started getting their ranch and its pretty good."}
{"text":"I grew up in Madison. I've been to this place many times even when it was formally known as Longos.  Ever since the name change, the pizza has been below average.  I've had experiences where the silverware and drinking glasses have been dirty. Service is slow and the prices are bit more than it is worth. I believe that this restaurant is so popular because it is the one of the few sit down places around."}
{"text":"This is the trough where most people from Chardon show up to on a nightly basis. Hostess staff is the most inefficient and rude I've ever seen. We got sat twice as the original table was \"reserved\" presumably for the \"Fat Italian\" as the wait staff's shirts say. Everything on the menu is straight out of Restaurant Depot, into the microwave and out to the table. No expo service - out meals came out in three batches with our salads showing up about 3 minutes before our entrees. This place would be more useful as a hole in the ground than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Joey's in Chardon has changed since they did a recent remodel. Food is always good for the most part, but the change since remodel is the NOISE LEVEL. The new decor certainly has nothing to do with Italian eatery. It looks like the inside of a dirty cabin. Who picked this out? JIG took some walls out etc n were left with a very large open space n the noise level is absurd. My family orders pizza n pasta to go for dinner, but do not want to sit in JIG to eat. As mentioned above the decor is very ugly n the NOISE LEVEL is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Very disappointed today. Long time regular but today was horrible. Ordered takeout and was told 40 minutes. Got there after 35 minutes. Wings were cold and pizza was Luke warm at best. I will continue to go there and eat at the bar but will think twice about carryout. :("}
{"text":"They're going through a major renovation now but we had takeout this time so it wasn't a problem. Its still open and much of the work appears related to the entrance and immediate surrounding area.  Given the location I'm giving this a 4 star. If it were in an urban locale it would be a 3 star, but the options are somewhat limited in Chardon, especially for Italian. The food is good, just not great. Of special note is the remarkably long gluten-free menu.  It has several items including Chicken Parm which are really unique. Also the gluten free pizza is one of the better ones in the area. The normal pizza is Longo's as they are owned by the same family. Joeys is a place where you can leave satisfied with good, friendly service and above average food, but you won't feel like it was truly revolutionary."}
{"text":"I am sure I will clearly sound like I am an Employee and or the like but I promise you that I am just a Customer!  Yes I have had issues with the 'lady at the front desk' as other reviews have stated, I go there often enough that I just walk right past her and seat myself at the bar as opposed to waiting to be seated in the dining room.  I come  here to enjoy the Long Islands and to watch the TV's while I have lunch or dinner either alone, or with my husband & family & friends.  I am also the type of customer that if my service is lacking and or I have any issues with my meal or the service I am receiving I will watch for the Manager and make sure I let him know what said issues are.  The Managers here are 1000% happy that you are dining there and will immediately handle whatever the issue is.  I do not mean for that to sound like I hound them and or expect for them to comp my meal as each situation has its own circumstances.  I have gotten to know the staff as I dine here so frequently is my point.  That being said my review is as follows:   I eat here at least once or twice a week.  Especially during Happy Hour.  They have an extensive happy hour menu that includes meals in addition to drink specials, considering Happy Hour is Monday-Friday 4-7 P.M as well as during Browns, Steelers, Ohio State, Michigan, Indians & Cavs day games it truely feels like it is always happy hour here. (Yes I have that memorized!) They also offer daily and weekend specials.    My favorite go to items are Joey's Hand Breaded Chicken Tenders, Chicken Broccolini Alfredo, I add mushrooms,  Ultimate Chicken Salad (all of these have full portion or happy hour menu pricing) as well as the giant Antipasto salad with house dressing, and I can not leave out the $4 happy hour ($5 regular price) Long Island Ice Tea.    Joey's also has a Gluten-Free Menu available for those that require it.  They do however request that you notify them of any food allergies when you are ordering.    I love that Joey's believes in local sustainability, so that means I support local farms and markets each and every time I eat here!  This is very important to me as I favor local businesses over the chains every chance I can get.   I chose the price range of $11-$30 as that would include me having 2 Long Islands with my meal."}
{"text":"Service was very good.actually the server was over board to make sire every thing wS well I had fish fry which was very tasty.the cole slaw was bitter and not edible However the french fries were crispy and hot just the way they should .my wife had pasta dish and she enjoyed just a tad aladente for her."}
{"text":"Hey guess what?  I am a fan!  Saturday dinner time, about 50% full.   * Free garlic-y bread knots.  wow.  inhaled.  * I have balsamic chicken sandwich and side salad.  House dressing was homemade.  Or at least it tasted that way. * Kids spag/meatballs.  Good portions  Place is clean; servers are tidy and attentive.  We'll give it another go!"}
{"text":"Always great service and excellent food. The hostess Marcy is very friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We've been coming here consistently for several years. The food is some of the best in the area   The service is usually great although you can sometimes get a dud  but they are usually friendly and attentive. The only strange thing is they serve frozen French frys. No real restaurant in NEO serves French frys that are frozen and poured out of a bag!  I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The bruschetta was nice. The Lake Erie Perch was good. Mom loved her quesadilla. The service was good. Good place for families as there are plenty of large tables. Big menu. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Foods alright best thing there is the pizza and Tuesdays nights is trivia which is a lot of fun."}
{"text":"This is a joke.  I am surprised that the Longo family allows this place to run like this.  Second time I have been in there and waited over 10 minutes to be acknowledged by a server. This time after 10 minutes we got up and left.  As we were leaving one of the hostesses said to the other \"did you not give them a server?\"  We sat and had 3 tables sit down after us...Each of them were served within 30 seconds of sitting.  Since This isn't the first time this has happened....we won't be back."}
{"text":"Once was enough.   Bad food, horrible service and too expensive...that's not a good combination.  I've had better frozen Italian food and even my kids refused to eat their personal pizzas. I took a bite and understood why...The pizza was disgusting.  The worst part was the rude hostess who seemed burdened we were there to spend our money."}
{"text":"A classic Chardon watering hole. Offers great specials, solid atmosphere, and good tv selection. They open with a strong complimentary basket of garlic knots. The group I went with was gluten-free, so I ended inhaling nearly 2 baskets myself. Salad was good and the house dressing was phenomenal. Main course was the swordfish special and it was delicious. Definitely will be returning"}
{"text":"Our Go-To place.  Have not had a bad dinner here.  Love the pizza and grouper.  Chicken tenders are fresh and hand breaded.  Good family atmosphere.  Know most of the waitstaff by name.  There is normally a wait at peak hours but well worth it.  Love Trivial Tuesday.  Great specials.  We go there often for family celebrations."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the second time today. It always looks busy so I figured the first bad experience was maybe a fluke. No...it wasn't. First of all, there's probably 500 cigarette butts outside the front door. Obviously a container of butt's was knocked over but it has definitely been on the ground for weeks at least. The garlic knots came with a hair baked in one. They were definitely microwaved because after about 5 minutes they were so hard that you couldn't bite into them. My daughter's pasta with butter was more of a butter soup with noodles in it. My buffalo chicken wrap came out as a buffalo chicken sandwich with mayo instead of blue cheese. This place is terrible! The only reason it stays in business is because we have no other choices in Chardon. I will not go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Joeys in a while! I really like the new atmosphere to the place! I was so happy to see that thy catered to the gluten free and vegetarian crowd!! It can be so hard to find a restaurant in a small town that caters to allergies! I was able to get anything I really wanted!!! I settled for the gluten free pasta and chicken breast with olive oil and garlic sauce... I was not too impressed with the taste.. it lacked a lot of flavor.. I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to taste anything ..the Italian dressing for salad was pretty good though! The salad itself was unimpressive .. just iceberg lettuce and I think some cucumbers (I couldn't have the croutons, and don't like tomato) but it would of been nice to see some egg, onion, cheese!    But I def will be going back to try the gluten/dairy free pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. The hostess was nothing short of rude. We ordered drinks while we waited for a table and sat down on the patio to enjoy.  The hostess quickly followed us out to scold us for sitting at an empty table. We were happy to leave and order food from a competitor that was happy to accommodate a party of 6."}
{"text":"This in a quaint restaurant. Great atmosphere. Great service. Great prices. My favorite local restaurant!"}
{"text":"Well ordered chicken parm and parm crusted chicken. Had side salads which were ok. the sauce on the chicken parm noodles were not very good and both chicken dishes need more seasoning very BLAND. if your over 70 you might like it. Service was great and so was atmosphere. Overall I wont be going back , they are many more Italian places that are better."}
{"text":"Yes, good place for great Italian pasta !  Good service and nice size servings. All 6 of us tried something different on menu and everyone was very pleased with what they got!  As we were leaving we met a couple who knew of the one in Madison and Mentor also. Said those were just as good! Anyone who had a \"bad experience\" at Joey's likely just don't like to mix because they do stack you in tight. No big deal for us since we've dined in DC the last 10yrs and that's the norm. If you want to eat at home alone just use their take out and rate the food not your \"bad experience\" !"}
{"text":"They offer vegan pizza, which is a plus for me. Service was friendly and the food tasted okay. It seemed a bit overpriced and not anything special. We might try it again if we were in the mood for Italian close to home, but it wouldn't be a go-to destination."}
