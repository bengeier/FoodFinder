{"text":"If I could give no stars I would.  Came here for breakfast for Father's day with my dad.  It was busy but no so busy that we weren't seated right away.  The wait was horrendous.  30 minutes before the waitress took our order and then another hour of waiting before I got fed up and asked what was going on.  Waitress told us the kitchen was extremely backed up and she couldn't even give us a time our food would come.  She said she wouldn't charge us for our drinks and we could cut our losses and leave.

We did just that and went to steak n shake, of course by this time after waiting for two hours at burgers n beer/breakfast, they were no longer serving breakfast --- but we did get to eat at least!

Absolutely ridiculous, would never come here again.  Bad communication, service, decor --- not sure about the food since we never got to eat."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the breakfast or beer, as I wandered in at lunchtime, but the burgers here are vile -- poorly cooked, greasy enough to fuel a diesel engine, and served on a roll that might have started as garlic bread but turned into a grease sponge by the time it made it to the table. The limp sweet potato fries did not help.  This is the kind of place that you'd go to and then not return until enough time had passed for you to have forgotten that you vowed never to return. Yuck."}
{"text":"Eh. Went there with a groupon. Good beer specials on a Wednesday night. I like seeing Bass on tap. I wish the price you paid for a burger would include a side. Then it might be worth the price you paid for a burger."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast when visiting the area. Our experience started off with us waiting for several minutes for someone to seat us only to be told we couldn't be seated if we walked through the main entrance, we had to go back out and enter through the door marked \"please use other door\" with an arrow pointed to the main entrance. It was literally the same room. Once we got seated at a table covered in milk and bacon, we ordered; a blt, a breakfast burrito and homefries. It took them over 45 minutes to bring our food, and the restaurant was only half full. While we were not expecting much, both dishes were very underwhelming. The blt had one small slice  of tomato on it and two slices of bacon, and the eggs were pretty undercooked. After two bites you were pretty much eating bread. The scrambled eggs in tortillas were pretty soggy and the homefries had absolutely no seasoning other than grill grease. Additionally the woman checking out behind had bought a groupon for the restaurant and they were refusing to honor it for no reason it seemed (we left before the manager got there). Needless to say, choose literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place just driving around on a lazy Saturday.  Hubby and I wanted a patio to catch some sun and some lunch.  Great little hole-in-the-wall and gives great small town bar feel.  Menu was what you'd expect, hence the name.  Service was really good and friendly.  Burgers were cooked correctly and the garlic fries are super tasty.  Super filling portions and several beers later, bill under $60 w/tip.  I'd definitely go back."}
