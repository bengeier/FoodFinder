{"text":"Breakfasts are okay. Quite during the week if you're going for breakfast or lunch but quite busy on the weekends. The manager isn't that great. Was rude with us a couple of times."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience on Wednesday June 27th '18. A strong urine odor walking up to the hostess booth? She brushed it off on a smelly female client who apparently just left? I start off by ordering a tea. Never came? Had to ask someone else? I could hardly understand the waitress with her super strong accent. My meal arrives before the soup? Had to ask where the soup is? Instead of taking my plate to keep it warm, she pushes my plate to the side and puts down the bowl and walks away! Then to add insult to injury she gives me my bill and wants me to pay right away! I asked why? She said that many people have walked out without paying? REALLY? So treat all your clients as criminals? I immediately paid,  (no tip!) grabbed my newspaper and walked the hell out!I'm sorry but this was the experience that will cause me NEVER to go back! Period! Plus the smell still was at the hostess booth 40 minutes after I walked in? Do NOT go if you don't have to. There are plenty of great breakfast places that give you more than just good food but great service and a smile too! Go there instead."}
{"text":"I've done take-out once and just ate in today, so after 2 tries I would firmly rate them a 3/5. I preferred my smoked salmon eggs benedict that I had today to the crepe with apple and cheddar that I had a couple weeks ago. Both plates had generous portions, far more than I can eat in one sitting. The fresh orange juice wasn't too sweet which is exactly how I like it. However, like many other brunch spots in the city, the QPR suffers. Are 2 breakfasts and 2 glasses of juice worth over $50? Probably not very often."}
{"text":"Alex is his name,very friendly and he make sure that we are enjoying our meal.Excellent customer service...Good Job Alex!"}
{"text":"First time at an Allo! Mon Coco chain. Another breakfast place like any other so I don't really have high expectations. Which is fine when all you want is a classic breakfast. I got the two eggs with bacon and was dissatisfied with my eggs. The yolk was almost fully cooked. I like mine runny and this was far from it! The rest of the food on the plate was ok. For 6,50$ (from 6am-9am Monday-Friday) it isn't so bad. Luckily the waitress was really nice and friendly."}
