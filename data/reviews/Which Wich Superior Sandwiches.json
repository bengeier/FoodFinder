{"text":"The sandwich I ordered was sooo delicious and people working here are really kind. I especially really like the idea of selecting what we want on the paper bag, since I am an anxious person when it's about ordering food, haha. I definitively never go to subway again. I found my new favorite sandwich place !"}
{"text":"Staff was pleasant and helpful yet both my wife and I thought this was a one and done situation.  
I try and only leave reviews that are positive or to business owners as feedback.  This one is the latter. 
My wife ordered a small gyro.  She said the sandwich was dry and the meat was non existent.  She said the bread tasted old, and the sandwich could of used a tasty sauce and more fresh vegetables.   
I ordered a double meat pastrami.  The meat was very salty and I also thought my roll was stale.  Very minimal toppings and dry.  I didn't bother eating the large half of the sandwich due to lack of interest.    Product needs improvement.  My opinion of your bread would be to replace.  Stale or not.  No flavor."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This was my first time eating here and it was great! I had the Chicken Pesto on white with lettuce, tomato, olive salad. It was SO good I wish u had gotten the large!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow...I'm so glad I found this place on yelp. It's officially, this is my wife and I's sandwich shop. You can create any kinda sandwich you want. I know most people would say you do that at any shop but this place has many choices of ingredients that  will make you come back to create something new.
Now, when you go there for the first time it may be overwhelming because you don't know the ordering process. Once you figure it out you'll love it. 

Go here NOW!!!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at Which Wich in Colorado, but kind of forgot about it when I moved to Las Vegas. My girlfriend is all about Jimmy Johns, and they're ok, but when I saw there was a Which Wich not too far from where I lived, I couldn't wait to try it.  I wasn't disappointed. I'm a vegetarian, and this is one of the few sandwich places I can get something other than bread, mayo and grilled onions (I'm looking at you, Subway). My go to Wich is a black bean patty on wheat with lots of feta.  The menu can be a bit daunting at first, but the staff at Wich Wich will walk you through, and they do it in such friendly way, you don't feel too self conscious your first time.  I'm a fan of Which Wich, especially this location. Stop by and grab a Wich sometime. You'll love it."}
{"text":"GREAT tasting sandwiches. I like the idea of building your own sandwich. There's plenty of cheeses, veggies and dressings to choose from. The bread is awesome, especially when you order it toasted. It has that perfect crunch on the outside and softness on the inside."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cobb salad wrap, tortilla was soft and fresh. We ordered via online which was simple and convenient. Parking was okay a lil walk especially being 111  degrees outside wasn't the most pleasant experience. Novelty experience....nothing special though."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Best sandwich place in Vegas. The staff is really nice, store is clean and they offer me water cup while I wait for my food which I really appreciated since it's too hot. I drive 10 miles everyday to get my salad here. I wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops around. You fill out your order on the outside of the bag that they'll put your sandwich in, so you don't have to watch them like a hawk and get your order right. If you're a picky eater like me that's a big deal. I get the chicken sandwhich in just the regular size. They will toast the sandwich for you so it comes out delicious. Just like Quiznos only not going out of business.

Their chocolate chip cookies are amazing! They run them through the oven too. These people should be running a bakery with their chocolate chip cookie game. My only complaint is that they don't like to stock bottled sodas. I prefer that to the fountain soda. It just tastes different to me."}
{"text":"My wife brought me home a sandwich from here and it was delicious. So, on our trip out to Westgate to catch an early morning movie, we decided to stop by here and grab lunch. First, the food is great. It is a bit pricey (e.g., $10 a sub), but the quality is worth it. Second, my only complaint is the atmosphere of this place. I don't know if it was because the store had opened less than an hour before, but I did not feel welcome here. It was synonymous with, \"What do you want? Okay, get your food and go.\" We had lunch in this place and if a pin needle fell, we'd all probably dive to the floor because of such a loud noise occurring. The workers here said nothing to anyone. Instead, they'd appear from the back of the place, walk across the lobby, and then return to the back without really doing anything. 

All in all, the food is great, but you better get it to go. This place has a worse atmosphere than the morgue."}
{"text":"Terrible sandwiches and even worse service. Let's begin. The bbq pork and coleslaw sandwich tasted like fish, hardly had any meat, way too much mustard and didn't have the coleslaw. We would have complained, but the service attendant was rude, unhelpful and didn't seem to like his job from the time we ordered, so we didn't bother complaining for fear we would get a spitball in our sandwich. Then, our daughter's kids meal had old dilapidated apple slices and no carrots (as described on the menu). Oh and don't even think about going anytime near closing. We had to deal with the clanking of chairs and the putrid smell of disinfectant being sprayed all over the neighboring tabletops. Ugh!"}
{"text":"You've gotta try the wicked!!! I've filled two of their punch cards on just the wicked sandwich....it's a must try"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we would definitely come back again. We had great service from the friendly staff and our sandwiches were really tasty too :)"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food.  The bread is great and there are tons of choices of meats and toppings.  Everything on our sandwiches tasted really fresh and the cookies were deeelish.  Service was good.

I love the way you order by checking things off of the list on your sandwich bag so no one can misunderstand your order and get it wrong.  The teeny tiny area in which you fill out your list, however, is kinda ridiculous... especially during the super busy lunch rush.  And there's not a whole lot of seating, either. 

I'd go back, though.  Hopefully next time I can go before/after the big lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my experience at Which Wich.  I entered the store, was not greeted, and not told how to order a sandwich. The store was not busy to justify being ignored.  Once I figured out the ordering system I ordered the ruben sandwich with double meat.  I got the combo and the total came to $10.50. Thankfully I had a free sandwich coupon, but that is a lot of money.  I was not offered a cup for my soda and had to ask for one.  A few minutes later I got my sandwich which was suprisingly light.  My instinct told me that there was something wrong, but I ignored this and took my sandwich back to my office.  I opened up the sandwich, plenty of meat, no dressing, no sourkraut.  I called the restaurant to complain.  The person on the phone was sufficiently apologetic and offered me a free sandwich, but the damage was already done.

There is no reason to eat here again.  I'll be eating at Capriotti's."}
{"text":"Easily the most disgusting meal I have ever tried to eat in a restaurant. My husband and I decided to grab lunch, he suggested the Which wich based on the yelp reviews. I ordered the Reuben which was a new menu item. I ordered the sandwich hot. There was only one other person in the store, they were not busy. When I received the sandwich, the cheese was not even melted, calling it luke warm would be kind. When bit into the sandwich I could not physically bite through it because it was like biting into a piece of grizzled shoe leather. To say it was fatty doesn't even begin to describe the texture. So, to be fair, I tried the other half, same deal. So gross. I then threw the sandwich away. The boy behind the counter asked me how the sandwich was and I told him. He said \"oh, ya, the meat looked really fatty and the pieces that were in there didn't looked wrapped right, and there wasn't a lot of meat.\" At that point all I could do was stare at him in disbelief that he essentially told me he was A) to lazy to cut new meat for my sandwich B) he opted to put what he described as \"not wrapped right meat\" on a sandwich and serve it. What does that mean not wrapped right?!? Like not to health code, like bad meat?!? Then the manager comes out and the kid's sort of back peddling and says to the manager \"they didn't do a very good job last night.\" To which the manager responds \"yeah, well they were really busy.\" 
WOW... Not once was I offered compensation, apology or any other reason to ever eat at that lousy place again. Save yourself the trouble go somewhere else even the crappiest chain sub shop I can think of has better service and food."}
{"text":"Just opened up my lettuce wrap and it's in pieces you cannot even pick up and eat it. Never had it look this bad before. I won't be going here again especially when you pay a high price and your lettuce wrap looks like this"}
{"text":"I've been eying this place for awhile. Each time I've gone to a concert or hockey game I've debated on trying this place out. Well, finally I gave in before a hockey game.

My toasted pastrami sandwich was very good, but I found the sandwich small in both length and width. I would have expected a bit more for $5.25. I could eat two of these sandwiches without a problem.

I had a great oreo milkshake with my meal. There are several shake flavors to choose from-chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and pineapple (who knew?).   

I'm always a fan of crushed ice for drinks.

The shake and sandwiches were fixed within just a few minutes of ordering and paying.

I think the concept of ordering the sandwich by marking your choices on the paper bag and then handing off to the cashier is catchy. This process is pretty cool and unique compared to other delis/sandwich shops in the area.

My final rating is 3.5,"}
{"text":"One of my favorites because of all the options + sweet tea. This particular location is so slow. Limited seating. Took 20 minutes to get my sandwich while standing around waiting. 3 guys working, only 1 making sandwiches."}
{"text":"Blows subway out of the water FASHO! 
Workers are always very kind and the place is always kept tidy. I order a lot of different toppings and they never get it wrong. huge plus is they will wrap your sand which in lettuce if you wana be a skinny girl and it tastes delish"}
{"text":"Ok sandwiches. Nothing spectacular. Convenient to the nearby movie theater. I had BLT and it was made with bacon bits. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The Superfood Wich is bomb.  I'll definitely be back to try the other offerings.
Order online if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"This started out as a 5 star review a few hours ago. Service was fantastic, sandwiches delicious. I got the buffalo chicken my husband the bac-hammon. Within 2 hours we are both sitting here very sick. Something was contaminated! The only two items that were the same on our sandwiches were mayo and provolone. So it was that or someone failed to wash their hands. Sorry, but after this incident i don't think we will be returning :("}
{"text":"Love this place! It's only 5 minutes away from my place and it's so good and unique! Going here more often."}
{"text":"Today was our family's first time at this sandwich shop. Family consisting of our 9yr, 2yr, my husband and myself.
 We walked in where there were few guests and an extremely unwelcoming employee just standing at the register.
We looked around as to how the place worked. We told the cashier we'd never been there before.
The cashier said fill out a bag and give it to me. I wanted the gyro but there wasn't a bag for that. I just wrote it on the back of one. My husband wanted the meatball sandwich so marked it. Our girls wanted on and j and filled out theirs. Cashier takes the bags and we sit. We had to ask for our drinks. He gives a tokens but we had no clue what those were even for. We had to ask about that too. 
So now with no other orders in you'd think ours would be in the works. Not quite. There was one other employee whi was sharing phone pics as the two were making jokes and laughing I was curious how that was more important than starting our order. We quietly sat waiting and listening to how the one employee couldn't wait to get off to go Capriotti's sandwich shop. Sounded like bad business to me. 
So my gyro was ready first. My husband's meatball sandwich was shortly behind. Husband opens his to find a plain flat sandwich. No cheese no marinara. It looked nothing like the picture. The cashier who later claimed to be the manager ( incase you see him there, he has a dirty facial appearance and wears two black ear plugs) told my husband he opened the sandwich and that's what he has to keep and he offered to hand him a cold slice of cheese with some marinara on the side. I reminded the \"manager\" again how we'd never been there before and could he make the sandwich the way my husband wanted it. He told us no and since opened it, it's a health code violation that they can't take it back. Manger became sarcastic and said this is your writing. You filled it out so I'll make you another one but you have to PAY for it!
What? What kind of customer service is this? This is a manager? 
I was now very upset at the back and forth he was giving infront of our children. I said to him he's being unreasonable and he has thee worst customer service I probably have ever seen. We said cancel the other 2 sandwiches and at this point we'll take a refund. 
I said, it would've been a better for him to eat it (meaning eat the cost) He was so ready to further argue and wouldn't stop having a negative comment to us that he twisted his wrist and flung the bag, spinning it at my husband and said, \"You eat it, I'm not eating that\") 
We told him how we noticed how unfriendly and miserable he was when we walked in without a greeting, only a look.
Then he proceeded to tell my husband he was a \"Bad person\"! 
Ooookay... we're bad people for telling you, your not doing your job? 
Again, infront of the kiddos.
We were infuriated at this point when I said what's taking you so long to return our money? 
In the end he refunds our $30 plus dollars. 
That's actually when he revealed he was the manager and when I asked for the owners information he pointed to his card and said go ahead, call him implying he could care less of what Bobby(owner) thought. As we were turning to leave he said, \"Leave now or  I'm calling security.\" That was laughable.
We walked out with 2 apple juices and the gyro (where I threw it all away at the first trash can). 
So instead of remaking a sandwich and educating the guest,
 he returns all of our money and gives us a gyro plus 2 drinks. He lost way more than a sandwich remake. Most importantly, lost customers!
That makes zero sense.
This guy has no business in customer service. I've worked in customer service my entire life, my husband is an Executive Chef at a high end restaurant so I believe we have a more than decent amount of experience in this industry.
We did call Bobby. We'll find out if he condones this behavior soon but it'll be by the rest of you who dare enter this shop. 
If you want to be ignored, your food wait as they look at cell phone pics, and be verbally abused then this is your spot.
First impressions leave a lasting mark and customer service is everything.
Needless to say we will never go back. I would recommend anyone to choose one of the other thousands of restaurants to give your money to in Las Vegas. 
As a matter of fact maybe I'll take the employees idea, and for my next sandwich just go to Capriotti's?"}
{"text":"This is my fav \"fast food\" place out there!

The first time I tried Which Wich was when I was working the NHL All Star Game in Dallas. In the local mall's food court, I saw this new sandwich place. So I grabbed some sandwiches for my coworkers and we all loved it!

I noticed they put one in Westgate a couple years ago and have been going quite a bit.

The sandwiches are hot and you really get what YOU want. Sorry Subway, now you know why I haven't emailed or texted. 

The turkey, chicken and hummus are great sandwich choices. Do yourself a favor and for an xtra $2, get double meat. 

I eat lunch here at least 2x a week!"}
{"text":"They are actually pretty good, I prefer them over Subway that's for sure! There was only one girl working and she was answering personal calls from her cell phone however she was really knowledgeable about everything they offered and gave us some great suggestions so we ignored the cell phone thing."}
{"text":"I can't really review the food, I wasn't able to actually get any. My husband and I placed our orders - lots of different sandwich and topping selections by the way - and since the line was short they started our sandwiches immediately. Unfortunately, we weren't able to receive our order, as their system was not able to take credit cards that day. Ummm.... Maybe next time they can put a sign on the door indicating that? Or at least let the customers know prior to ordering. Some bum is going to get a couple really tasty looking club sandwiches out of the dumpster tonight. As for us, we will give them a couple weeks to work out the bugs before we try them again."}
{"text":"Delicious food! You customize your own sandwhich and it always comes out fantastic.  My only \"complaint\" is that it takes a few minutes to make them, and really it's not a complaint this isn't Subway so be prepared to have an amazing meal take a second to prepare."}
{"text":"they forgot my avocado! I clearly said I wanted some but they forgot and never PUT SOME. SMH I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO MY FOOD!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Yes, the concept can be a little confusing on your first visit, but I was immediately asked if I had any questions about how to place my order. They have an incredible variety of toppings  to fix your sandwich just the way you want it. 
Lately I've been using their app to place my order, and it is ready when I get there.
They offer three sizes, the small is plenty big to fill me up, and I'm a very hearty eater.
My wife and I will split a large, if we both agree on the same thing.
Other sandwich shops have \"the one\" subs that Is their best sandwich, this place has a sandwich called the WICKED; It is awesome!
There rewards program is good also."}
{"text":"Over 20 minute wait for 2 sandwiches on a Tuesday night when we were the only ones in the restaurant...no thanks, I'll go to Jersey Mike's next time."}
{"text":"Overall... Awesome.  Sandwiches were big, fresh and tasted great!

Negatives were that this is one expensive lunch (over $50 for 5 sandwich meals). Also, two of the five of us wanted Cubans and were hoping for an authentic \"pressed bread cuban\".  The sandwich tasted great but a Cuban is NOT a toasted white bread roll....and they shouldn't call this a Cuban, because its clearly not!  O'well ... Still good!

This would be a 3.5 if halves were available but the Cubans dropped them down."}
{"text":"Huge selection of sandwiches but they are a little on the small side, Very tasty though.  Had the french dip and added carmelized onions.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I eat here 2-3 times a week.  The sandwhiches are very good and ordering is unique.  The employees are friendly and helpful.  Day manager \"Ebbi\" is the best!  She's a people-person who learns and remembers her customers' names and takes ownership of the business."}
{"text":"They're milkshakes are to die for!!
I love the ability to pick anything I want. 
The kids menu is awesome too. Nothing scary for the kids. (Grilled cheese, peanut butter and jelly.....ya know, the good stuff)"}
{"text":"Which wich do you want? With more than 50 to choose from, there is something for everybody.  

I chose the Thank You Turkey: turkey breast, cranberry and stuffing - a Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich. Well, I got my sandwich and it had NO cranberry and minimal stuffing, and let me tell you, I like my sandwiches STUFFED. So, with that, minus a star. To their credit they did completely remake my sandwich and the manager came to our table, apologized and gave us a warm and gooey chocolate chip cookie - YUM. 

I just couldn't help but compare this place to Sak's.  I am a huge Sak's fan and I always get the Improv, which is similar to the Thank You Turkey and it didn't compare. So, with that, minus another star.

Not horrible, but nothing special.  It would, however, be a quick, cheap treat before or after any football/hockey game."}
{"text":"Which Wich is probably one of THE BEST sandwich shops you can find on the West Coast. They have a unique ordering system where you choose a general sandwich type and grab a bag with a checklist of ingredients that you can circle or check off for the food handlers to put into your delicious sandwich.

Since I only care about taste and less about presentation, I went wild with the ingredients and practically packed my sandwich to the max. I went with the gyro sandwich and added avocados, caramelized mushrooms, and hummus in addition to the standard lettuce, tomatoes, and onions that sandwiches have.

As you can imagine, the flavor was intense and more than I could handle. This is no ordinary sandwich shop and I'm sad the location is so far away from where I live. I make the drive once every month to that shop to relive my sandwich greatest hits.

The restaurant is small, clean, and not noisy. It's family friendly and the staff is very helpful to help and accomodate you with any questions you may have about their unique ordering process.

I'd definitely defer from going to other sandwich places in the area. Which Wich is worth the 20 mile drive."}
{"text":"Soooo many sandwiches to choose from.  There's 60 different choices.  Try the black bean patty!  It's yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service and a really clean restaurant. And the sandwiches are completely customizable, my favorite part"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I wished I had gone somewhere else.  I'm ok with the ordering process, where you pick a bag and write what you want on it, fork it over to the cashier and in about 5 mins they call the name on the bag for you to pick up.  
The first time I had some type of shrimp sub, the shrimp were tiny, breaded, cold and just gross.  The sandwhich size is small, in this case I was glad because I didn't want to gag down a huge sandwhich nor throw away a huge sandwhich.  The veggies are not crunchy or crisp like they would be if they were fresh- they were actually soggy like they were old. 

The next time I went with turkey thinking that was a safe bet.  NOPE.  It was still as gross as the first time, just with a different meat.  

I was not impressed and would choose Subway over this place."}
{"text":"Which Wich is AMAZING, and they have a lovey menu for those who choose not to eat meat. I love the black bean patty bowl and the pumpkin pie shake is the best I've ever tasted. The people there are always nice, and I look forward to going every time."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the service was exceptional!  They led us through the ordering process and asked if we wanted to add on chips/drink etc and made sure we knew of the charges.  
We ordered the Thanks Turkey - or what I like to call Thanksgiving on a sandwich.  I have ordered this at other shops - not Which Wich.  I am used to having fresh turkey on the sandwich not cold cuts.  The stuffing was hot where the rest of the sandwich was cold.  Just kinda didn't flow for me.  
My mother ordered a roast beef on wheat.  Whereas her RB was good, the bread was a bit stale.  As she stated, it tasted like it had been around for a few days.  Maybe it was an off day for the shop as well as us.  I have friends who rave about this place!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and I find the sandwiches to be pretty tasty and that is about it. You pay 5.75 for a sandwich and that is all you get! Very expensive for a tiny toasted sandwich. It's a shame that it is so overpriced because it would otherwise be a nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"Good location, good food, a little pricey, okay service. Will go back for the fresh subs!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches.  Chicken Cordon Bleu was my favorite.  Used to go every Tuesday during work lunch for double stamp Tuesday.  Friendly staff, big with the Westgate businesses.  Expect long lines however on Tuesdays, and Cardinals or Coyotes game days."}
{"text":"Yummy! Super nice staff. Sandwich is awesome. Better then Jimmy Johns...love the ordering process. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When it comes to sandwiches, Which Wich has it down!  They may not be the largest sandwiches, but there are times with quality wins out over quantity, and this is one of those times!

The variety available to you beats out any other sandwich shop in town (INCLUDING subway and the like), and you will find yourself having unexpected cravings for these sandwiches once you've tried your first.

The music is a bit too loud most of the time, but the service is friendly and fast, and the hard-to-find crushed ice is a must since it is so rare these days (lets face it, what QT calls crushed ISN'T!).

If you're not sure, go to the website, and join the club ... they send you an email for a free sandwich.  What better way to try them out, than with a free sandwich, right?"}
{"text":"Which Wich has a unique ordering method.  You walk in and fill out your sandwich order on pre-printed paper bags.  Each bag is categorized by base type (Italian, veggie, etc.).  You fill it out with your sandwich selection and all the toppings, add your name to the bottom of the bag and turn it over to the cashier.

I grabbed the \"Italian\" bag and ordered the pepperoni sandwich.  I opted for the combo with a beverage and chips.  The chips were very good and from a local company (the name I've forgotten) and they had Mello Yello in the pop dispenser (yes, I said \"pop\").  That's a major bonus for me.  The pepperoni sandwich was pretty damn good.  

Based on the food quality Which Wich is a solid 4 stars.  I've opted to drop it to 3 stars because I don't think the price is good for the size of the sandwich.  The combo set me back over $8 for a 7 inch sandwich.  I understand that anything at Westgate is overpriced but it still irked me a bit.

I'd love to see a Which Wich open up closer to me (perhaps with better prices).  I won't go out of my way but if I need a bite to eat before a hockey game again, Which Wich will likely be my stop for grub."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their sandwiches are awesome and their employees are super courteous. They also give military a free drink. If you're looking for a quick and low priced sandwich come here!"}
{"text":"Best Sandwiches in the Greater Phoenix Metropolitan Area!!!! I am from the east cost where most of us have very high standards for our sandwiches. And I have to say that Wich Wich makes a damn good Sandwich!!! I cannot begin to explain how good these sandwiches are. They are too expensive for a lunch, but I don't care. I cannot resist. These sandwiches are seriously good!!!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to small sandwich joints similar to Capriotti's, Firehouse, Subway, Port of Subs, etc. This particular place stands out. Here is why.

1. I was served immediately. 
2. The ordering style is unique.
3. My sandwich was made momentarily. 
4. The quality of food was a 9/10.
5. The price was reasonable. 
and they have a connection with Yelp (free side if you check in.)

When you walk in, to your immediate left are bags, these bags coincide with your order, meaning the styles of sandwiches have their own specific bag. On each bag is a checklist in which you cross out your choices (with a sharpie given to you) and you hand it to the cashier in which they make your sandwich accordingly. 
I only needed to wait a maximum of 3 minutes until my name was called and I was given my sandwich (an italian grinder).

The sandwich itself was packed with meat and cheese, in which was flavorful, you could taste each individual flavor within the sandwich. Thus, I give this sandwich shop five stars, their only competition is Firehouse and it certainly stands out. Will be back here for sandwiches."}
{"text":"So after a watching two movies, wedding ringer  and into the woods,  my sister and i got wich wich  for dinner. It was as actually pretty good, i got the chicken pesto, my sister got the roast beef philly. The bread held everything in and the meat wasnt bland nor to salty. I would  definitely  come here again"}
{"text":"They have so many options!  It's a \"fresh\" approach, giving you a starting point and you create your own sandwich by checking off ingredients on the bag it will go it.  Everything I have ordered here is made well and very tasty.  Tons of options, so there's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Employee uses their cell phones with gloves on their hands and makes sandwiches with same gloves. Dirty food, also dirty finger nails, dirty shirts, dirty sagging pants.

Nasty employees with nasty food!
Also took 30 minutes to get the sandwich with only one employee. 
This location should be closed down."}
{"text":"So the boyfriend and I were an hour early for the Coytoes vs. Blackhaws yesterday, so we figured we'd get some food. We had planned on going to the BBQ place, which ended up having a 45-50 minute wait, as did Johnny Rockets, so we walked BACK to Which Wich. 

I was delightfully surprised! The little bags you mark your sandwich fixings on are charming, and super efficient. The folks behind the counter were cheerful, and the sandwich was delish!!

Perhaps one of the BEST sandwiches I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my favorite sandwich shop.

I love filling out my order on the sandwich bag and their menu is huge. They really have a lot of options even on the vegetarian menu. Hummus? Get out!

I love the design of their bags, cups and the restaurant itself. I'm a graphic designer, what can I say. I really appreciate those things.

The food is great too. I love their bread and the house chips with salt and pepper are really tasty. I love the idea of having a surf and turf sandwich, krab salad and roast beef. I tried it and it was a little bland, wish I had gotten the horseradish mayo with it. The buffalo chicken sandwich is really good, I get it with blue cheese. My friend got the Montecristo and it's probably my favorite wich so far."}
{"text":"I am a sandwich snob and i would say this is a above average sub sandwich. I would rate these sandwiches in a category above port of subs and jimmy johns, Subway  but below caps, pops, beach hut, earl of sandwich.

The customer service is pretty good and the meats not bad,"}
{"text":"Just wasnt satisfied with our meal. We came in with pur kids and got the kids meals they didnt have the apple slices gave us the meal without the kids drinks we had to ask for pur kids chocolate milk. We were the only ones inside so not sure of the delay. My ruben came out soggy like really soggy to the point that i wouldnt eat it. My wifes sandwich was the philly and it was equally as bad. I dont kow what happend with this place but maybe a time for new management."}
{"text":"very good, very refreshing, very fresh with a very creative spin on how to make a good sandwich, all in all my new favorite sandwich spot. fukk subway lol..."}
{"text":"5 stars, because they let you make what you want, you rate it lower because you suck at sandwich ideas."}
{"text":"This is still one of my favorite places to get a sandwich these days.

Which Wich is a quick service restaurant. You do have to wait a little bit longer to get your sandwich than you would at most quick service places though. The price is also a little high, but is about the same as what you would pay at Quiznos and other similar sandwich places.

This restaurant uses a unique way to take your order. You grab a sandwich bag and a marker at the front and you fill in bubbles on the bag to select your order.

I love the Italian Grinder and the chocolate chip cookies are also very good. One random thing I love about this restaurant is the crushed ice in the soda machines. I personally find the food here to be very tasty and to me it is worth the price and the wait. I would recommend getting the sandwich toasted. I think its much better that way, but it depends on your taste."}
{"text":"I was eating my wicked , as I seen the manager ask everyone how there food was doing  . I was resting my feet on a chair and he told me , that I couldn't have my feet on the chair . Then he asked me if I could eat my food at the tables outside , so a family of 4 could eat there meal. Cause I was eating at a table that sat 4. So I moved outside too finish eating my meal . After 5 mins my milk shake had melted . It's 1pm and like 105 degrees outside. So my milkshake, is melted so I pored it out in the trash and walked in too fill it up with juice . The manager approaches me again , he tells me I have too pay for the juice in my cup . So he takes my cup dumps it out and tells me too stand in line to purchase a new one . By the time I get back outside to finish my food I see that my sandwich is on the floor and there's birds picking at it .So I just left without finishing ."}
{"text":"You know...I really like these sandwiches, but 25 minutes is a REALLY long time to wait. It's 5:30 on a Saturday evening with only 7 people in the store other than me. I really don't see why a turkey club should take that long, even during a rush, which this wasn't."}
{"text":"Boy friend and I went to Which Wich tonight for the first time, severs was okay. We didn't get that big Hello welcome when we first entered that store but that's okay. What makes me rate this shop at a 2 is because I can go to Quiznos or Jimmy Jones and get better meat quality then here. The menu is quite large so I'm sure the had to be k up the prices to compensate of what they don't use has often. I got the cheese steak and if you like roast beef it's an alright sandwich but the meat just  taste processed. Not wroth 15 bucks for a 10\" sub."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money or your time.

What's wrong with this place:
1) You have to fill out a paper form to order your sandwich. This wouldn't be so ridiculously moronic if you didn't ALSO have to wait while the person working the register has to type in everything you just hand wrote down on the brown paper sack your sandwich ends up being delivered to you in.
2) The wait. Waiting. I'm still waiting... Now we have ONE of the two sandwiches from our order... 10 minutes later... finally we have our entire order. 10 minutes after we placed the order. TEN PLUS MINUTES FOR A SANDWICH. I don't mean to be overly negative, but at Subway I not only watch them make and toast my sandwich, it takes about four minutes from start to finish if there's no one in line ahead of me. This was the case at Which Wich. No one was ahead of me and I waited more than ten minutes per sandwich. Between having to fill our an order form by hand, waiting for the woman behind the counter to enter that form, then waiting for them to make the sandwich it took nearly 20 minutes. That is an abysmal failure of service. 
3) The food is just not worth the price or the wait. My sandwich was $9.00, it took more than 10 minutes to make, and I honestly couldn't finish it. I ordered a turkey sandwich, my wife order a turkey and ham club. In both cases the meat was minced. To be clear I mean it was chunked and what could only be described as put through a grinder so that the texture of the meat was unrecognizable to the original source of said meat. It was disgusting. It wasn't edgy, interesting, or unique. It was just gross. I literally couldn't finish it.

What's REALLY wrong with this place:
1) It feels like the concept was designed by a fifth grade teacher. It's essentially designed to make you follow a process that is both totally unnecessary and repetitious.  
2) When I asked the woman at the counter if I could just tell her what I want she said, \"No.\" After I filled out the paper bag and handed it to her she asked me, \"Did you figure it out okay?\" So what she's really asking is if I'm too stupid to fill out a form. Thanks for insulting me, then serving me terrible food for which I over paid. 
3) All the food on a single order should come up at the same time. By the time my sandwich FINALLY appeared, my wife was more than half done with her food. The entire process on which this restaurants is based is designed to create a \"UNIQUE\" customer experience that really just translates into a stupid waste of time. 

What's good about this place:
Nothing. Seriously. Don't go here."}
{"text":"I got the Gyro here. Why would you get a gyro from a sandwhich shop you ask? Because if you're going to offer a specialty \"sandwhich\" you better make it well. It was...ok. It barely had any Tzatziki sauce, other than that it was alright. The meat isn't really shaved, it's sliced looking. I'll go back, they have alot of choices and they sound good. 

The real star was the house made chips. Salt and Pepper ridges. Delicious."}
{"text":"Now which wich knows how to make a rockin' sub!

Nothing is more delish to me than a good sandwich... 

When I walked in guess I had that confused look on my face, but the nice female clerk came right over warmly greeted me and asked if it was my first visit. She took the initiative to politely, without making me feel dumb, to explain how their place 'works' where you find your '#' or sandwich variety on the menu, select a bag, choose a marker and write down your own custom style sandwich and what you would like on it. you can select or opt out of ingredients. write in custom options and personalize with your name knowing this bag will be made for you specifically. 

Then if you check in on Yelp you'll get a free \"add on\" which in my case I used for extra cheese. then the gal asked if I wanted a sandwich punch card and how
Mondays are a double punch day and so on.

Overall, awesome customer service & great menu selections! This is the place if you want a really good quick lunch customized to your liking and taste."}
{"text":"I was definitely confused upon entry, as this was my first time at any Which Wich.

It's a little overwhelming with all the choices but I really like the brown bag where you select all your own toppings.  There's just enough options without being too many to read through and the process is efficient.  Plus your wich is toasty and warm in your hands just a few minutes later.

The highlight is, amidst the chaos of westgate, when you don't want to sit down for a meal with waitstaff, or wait 2+ hours in line for a table when the game starts in 2 hours, and you don't want bad stadium food, this is the perfect option.  It's fast, it's easy, it's GOOD.

In fact, I'd return for a wich at another location."}
{"text":"What a way to make your sub for only 5 bucks!!  You have the choice of all kinds of meats and toppings plus killer shakes too!!  If you need a quick fix or want to sneek food into the movies stop by here you will not be disappointed!  Turkey pastrimi, buffalo chicken and gyro meats are to die for.  Just grab a sharpe. write your name on the top of the bag and check off the things you want on the sub..  that simple - well for some...  Its hard for me to pick what I want."}
{"text":"I have visited this location several times whether before a Cardinals game at the University of Phx stadium or during a conference that was at a nearby hotel. The food is good, fresh and prepared well. Easy and fast and convenient."}
{"text":"Had an awesome sammy here. You grab a paper bag and mark the sandwich and toppings you want. Perfect bread and fresh toppings. Best sammich ive had in a very long time"}
{"text":"The place has a great concept. You create your own sandwich by marking the ingredients on the paper bag you will get your food in. Pretty cool idea. However, the quality of ingredients wasn't great, but OK. The place can get busy and so expect a bit of a wait (for just a sub) 
The service is really bad! last time we took out from there, brought it home only to find out one of the sandwiches has so much mustard in it, it was inedible! Drove all the way back to the store, only to have the \"dude\" behind the counter give us attitude about it and argue that \"he made the sandwich himself and it was perfect\". (Not that he tasted it - I'd have liked to be allowed to force him to eat that mustardy sandwich himself and finish it down to the last bite!) 
Do you really think someone would drive all the way back just for a minor issue? The sandwich was inedible! Instead of apologizing for the inconvenience, he gave attitude! How rude! And to top it all off, he screwed up the replacement sandwich by forgetting one of the ingredients! We didn't drive back a second time. Sandwich was edible though it missed an ingredient. However, that was the last time we will be going to that place."}
{"text":"Now that TJ Max opened next door this place is no longer a secret! Longer wait times for sandwiches, and out of ice cream today for shakes. Please hire more well trained employees and stock up your supplies. The sandwiches still rock btw."}
{"text":"Really interesting place! I spotted this joint a while ago, since I go to the AMC theater pretty often, and decided to try it out after I got off work. I like the concept of this sandwich place, and the food was really delicious! My only thing was the people here did not seem too enthusiastic about customers coming in... But they still had about an hour left of being open. I'd understand if it was maybe 15 minutes till closing but, an hour? Really? And they weren't even trying to be secretive about it. The guy working the sandwich line was talking to his coworker (very loudly) about how customers always come in last minute and they never get to clean up on time and how they will never get to leave on time. Even as I'm writing this review he is still discussing it. I work in the food industry and I would never talk about anything like that in front of customers. It's just irritating to hear because this is your job, you should be glad that the business isn't slow. Would've been a five star review, but food is only half of what makes a restaurant good, gotta have a good attitude as well. Just my opinion though"}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich place and a very necessary addition to the lunch choices on Rainbow and Lake Mead. 

I had my staple, turkey and cheese, but added 1000 Island dressing instead of mayo and/or mustard. It was yummy. The bread (wheat) was fresh with a slightly crunchy crust and soft inside. The turkey tasted so nice that the toddler ate most of it out of my sandwich. 

I will definitely be going back because they have egg salad that is made just with mayo. This may sound boring but, for some reason, it is difficult to find a good egg salad sandwich.

Which Wich is absolutely worth visiting if you are in the mood for a good sandwich and a pretty reasonable price. Just be prepared to change your mind about what you want as you stand in front of the menu."}
{"text":"I wanted the reuben sandwich and they didn't have the rye bread, no big deal. But when we got our food my sons kids meal was supposed to have a sliced apple. Uhhh nope. The fountain drinks were not mixed right. Could have been just out of syrup, but didn't add to my experience. I will say the reuben was pretty good still, but not good enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"Walked in and there were 2 people in front of us. They needed the menu explained so I grabbed my bag and placed my order. We had an entertainment offer thru the mobile app.  Man at the register had an attitude. Something about not his offer he would have put something better. I explained there was a buy one get one free offer but I was only getting one sandwich. It was my first time eating there and probably my last. 
I paid and waited for my sandwich to be prepared. While waiting I observed many dirty habits such as taking money and making sandwiches without changing gloves or clearly rubbing your face more than once and continuing to prepare sandwiches. 
The floor was filthy with paper and food.
It took more than 15 minutes to get our sandwich because the grumbly unhappy sandwich girl had to correct several mistakes. The highlight of the sandwich was the bread! There was very little meat and way too much pepper.  Sorry Which Wich but even with a coupon I won't waste my time or money again."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. You order by writing what you want on the corresponding sandwiches bag, it's great. I had a delicious hot sub while my buddy enjoyed the gyro and shake greatly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Not crazy about this place, would still much rather go to subway. Nice employees but the sandwiches are seriously lacking. Very bland, my corned beef didn't have the popping flavor it should...not enough of anything on it."}
{"text":"First time coming here.  We got a beef sandwich which was pretty good but their gyro sandwich came with very little meat.  This means a lot coming from me b'c I typically don't like to eat that much meat.  

The sandwiches are more expensive than Subway but I would say only slightly better, if that.  I'm not a big sandwich person so maybe I am being a little picky.  I would say definitely try it once and see how you like it."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want a truly customized sandwich with seemingly every sandwich combination imaginable.  No soup or salad served here.  It's all about sandwiches.

Hailing from Texas and the South, Which Wich is a very McChain atmosphere -- from the moment you walk in, grab a paper bag (in which your sub is served and on which you write your choices) to the Which Wich logo'ed Sharpies to write with.  It's on this bag (which** has an imprinted menu) that you write your choices for veggies, cheese and other ingredients.

Every sandwich is $5 and you start out by making your choices, paying at the counter and watch as your bag goes up a clothesline and as your sandwich is sent through to be made, toasted, etc.  They were playing an NFL game as I watched, munched and tried to figure out what the hell I was eating. 

I ordered the Cuban with pork, ham, pickle slices and pepper jack. The pork was atrocious.  It was minced and microscopic like Gerber food or like someone pre-chewed it for me. It was probably just a bad choice, as I'm sure one of the 50 or so sandwiches has to be decent. 

The selection though is really its strength.  Every sandwich is categorized: turkey, ham, beef, pork, chicken, seafood, Italian, salads, classics, vegetarian and breakfast sandwiches. I mean they had a Shrimp Po Boy, Muffaleta, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Monte Cristo and even an Elvis Wich - with Peanut Butter, Honey and Banana.  Sideburns are additional.

All in all, not a bad place, I just won't pick the Cuban next time.  Not sure if it's worth going out of your way for though.

** Sorry about all the \"Whichs\" in here....it wasn't intentional."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches!  Love that you choose a bag and check the ingredients you want on your sandwich.  Similar to Sacks Sandwiches.  There are a ton of choices too, which makes so many possibilities. I had a club with a bunch of added toppings.  Make sure to get it toasted!! So good.  So much than Subway.  Definitely will be going to the San Tan location as it is closer to me."}
{"text":"Staff very nice. Fresh air flows through, but so do the flies. It's very spendy; 75.00 for 5 waffles and 5 drinks/fries. Otherwise,  it's fairly clean, and a trendy place to enjoy lunch."}
{"text":"The food is good. I really like the unique menu and ordering system they have with the paper bags. It's definitely a worth while stop but quality and taste wise they aren't far off of what subway has to offer.. but their prices are quite a lot higher. It's a fun thing to try once."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian or vegan option. Quick, fresh, easy, with lots of options. A scan-tron flashback to elementary school when you order. But still the food is good and fairly inexpensive. I wish there were more of these around town."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places of all time. Open at 9am so it's nice to grab lunch before work. Great prices for what you get and if you check in you get a free cookie or house chips and try warm up the cookie--yum! The only reason I give it 4 stars is normally it takes around 10 minutes to grab a sandwich if not busy and 15-20 when it is busy because they take a little while to customize it but it's definitely worth the wait! I would recommend this location to anyone especially if you're debating between jimmy johns, subway, etc. Which Wich in Westgate should be your first choice!"}
{"text":"Unique spot to grab a sandwich with your choice of toppings and sauces. Instead of being rushed through a line at subway, you can take your time and put together the perfect sandwich of your liking all on a brown paper bag. You do this by deciding the type of sandwich you want, chicken, Italian etc., grab that bag and a marker and fill out the rest. The varieties are endless. The bread is soft yet crusty and the milkshakes are a must! The only thing I've noticed that I really don't like, is the saltiness in the meat. Maybe it's only the chicken because that's what I usually get. But it just tastes like there's high sodium content. Other than that, I really enjoy a which wich sandwich. Oh yeah one more thing, I added bacon to my sandwich, I was expecting a slice of bacon but what I got was bacon pieces. I won't be ordering bacon anymore."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches.  Love the crabsalad.with all the fixings.  Always made to order and fresh sandwiches.  We do not have one by our house so my family always ask me to stop on my way home from work."}
{"text":"Just for 25 cents more.. This is waayyy better than subway. I love places like this where I can create my own meal. And best thing is they cook it and bring it to life. 

I've come here twice and so far everything I ordered was really delicious. I wasn't sure if I was to thank myself for creating the order or them for making it.. They have these menus with corresponding numbers to the bags you choose. Basically, you choose what meat you want and they're categorized from chicken, beef, ham and seafood. Then, you choose your toppings. Everytime I come to a sandwich spot.. I always look for two things; avacado and alpha sprouts. They had avacado but no sprouts :( but it's all good cus they have so many toppings to be just worrying about one topping.  They have their own house chips which are ruffled and seasoned with black pepper and salt. The size of these genius sandwiches are definitely filling.

I love the name itself. The staff always seems to be friendly and excited to see what people have invented. This place is an endless wonder of new things."}
{"text":"Waste of Time and Money.

Inexperienced slow staff and overpriced mediocre food. It must be this new location because the Matthews one is just fine. 

Save your wallet and time by choosing from the nearby Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mikes."}
{"text":"Unique! Is one word I would use to describe this fun restaurant.  

I just got done at LVAC which is really close to Which Wich.  As me and the gf walked in, a nice lady asked us if this was our first time here.  We said \"Yes!\" and she thoroughly explained how it worked.  There's brown paper bags numbered 1-10.  Whatever number 'which you want, you grab that bag, and on that bag are choices of that kind of sandwich, whatever ingredients you want, what kind of bread, sauces, etc.  They provide you with a red sharpie to 'x' mark the ingredients you want. At this point me and the gf are having fun just marking a brown paper bag! 

When your order is placed, they attach your marked brown paper bag to a clothes line so they can easily see what you want on your 'which.  We didn't get our food lighting fast but what good food is fast? None! Everything tasted just how I wanted it, the brown paper bag and sharpie idea is genius!  The sandwich was so good, I forgot about my house chips. (salt and peppered kettle chips) Which are hella good, simple too.

This was my first time here and I ordered their signature sandwich, The Wicked.  My first time experience was eye-opening to all these other whack sandwich shops.  I'm definitely gonna be coming back here and becoming a regular.

PS. Bathrooms are clean!"}
{"text":"We've been to other Which Wich shops before and have always enjoyed their sandwiches. The experience at this shop was by far the worst. We ordered 4 sandwiches and sat down to wait for our order. Only one out of the four sandwiches was right. My daughter ordered turkey and they ended up being out of turkey. I ordered a sandwich with tomatoes and they ended up being out of tomatoes. My wife ordered a French Dip and it was cold inside. If you are out of something like Turkey, why wouldn't you tell your customer that when they ordered. My wife complained to the manager and one member of the staff made a snide remark to my wife. The customer service at this place is awful. It's one thing to be out of something, it's another to treat your customers poorly when they have an issue with it. Unreal. We will not be eating at this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"This was my first time there and I ordered of French dip sandwich with sautéed onions and a vanilla shake. The lady at the register was very helpful since it was my first time visiting this restaurant. The quality of the food seem very high and lots of people were inside eating . I will definitely try this place again and look forward to trying many other sandwiches."}
{"text":"On top of the amazing freaking sandwich I so wonderfully blue printed, big black homie who made my sandwich went salt bae on it and delivered a Gordon Ramsay-esque roast beef sandwich. That sandwich was good as heck. If I had another $6.50, I would've gotten another one. My stupid self checked roast beef instead of French dip and he so kindly gave me a little Au Jus. I swear I was at Disneyland with this type of magical customer service. Kudos big homie."}
{"text":"What can I say? I am a whore for Which Wich. I know in reality its a run of the mill sandwich place but they have so many little features that speak to me it catapults ahead of almost any other place. 

1. Milkshakes. More sandwich places should have milkshakes. More any place should have milkshakes. Not only do they have milkshakes, but their milkshakes are awesome as can be seen by all the boy sin the yard. Milkshake
2. Pellet ice. For those of you who aren't ice conniseurs like me, pellet ice is the little sphere shaped ice pieces as opposed to large chunks. The increase in surface area makes drinks cool faster and the ice better to chew. It also creates a sort of archipelago  of icy cold deliciousness on the top of a soda and makes it fizz more. Pellet ice is the pinnacle of human evolution. 
3. Skinny- nothing ruins a fine sandwich like too much bread. The skinny at which wich turns those preposterous french rolls into little more than a thin crispy exoskeleton of bread leaving plenty of room to stuff with delicious meats and cheeses without making the sandwich explode

4. Ordering is quick and efficient. Sure, 1 out of 3 people in the door have no idea what is going on, but that just means you can cut in line in front of them -if they can't protect their space in line then it would be unAmerican not to.

5. Online app- all my orders have been ready on time for pickup, more than can be said for other so called sandwich places

6. Consistency - anyone who has ever been to a subway knows that how good your sandwich is will be a product of the individual sandwich artist. Some of them paint like picaso, others turn your order into a Jackson Pollack. Which Wich may not have the artistry but consistency more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Not my first pick for a sandwich chain, but gotta give them props for their multitude of customization options: where else can you get grilled onions, sliced egg, and pesto on your sandwich without anyone batting an eye?

Downsides: the ordering process isn't clearly outlined on signage at the door, so there's a backup if there are more than 3 customers in the store who don't know what they're doing. This is all locations I've been to though, not this one specifically.

Appreciate that orders are written down to ensure accuracy, but the system still relies on employees filling the orders and they're prone to human error- like forgetting the sliced egg I paid extra for and randomly tossing on jalapenos, when the olive salad is already a bit spicy.

The caprese option on the menu is a welcome addition, but the cheese is of low quality and this location didn't have balsamic, so it didn't hit the spot.
Italian option is solid, as are their Philly sandwiches, but I usually customize something ridiculous- free premium topping with check in, word!"}
{"text":"like most people..this is above subway and port of subs,  its  close to my house so
I use it as a go to \"i don't wanna cook tonight place'.   my oldest son always gets the 14 inch Wicked..with everything except olives..it is a monster of a sandwich that should easily feed four, but he eats it all by himself.  All in all we have been here numerous times and my kids never complain so they are alright in my book, plus the shakes are darn good."}
{"text":"Love this place usually, but this is hands down the slowest and most sub-par service I've ever had at one of these. The majority of people in line when I first got here left before ordering because it was so slow"}
{"text":"Our office is close by, which there really isn't a lot to choose from, so it's nice to have the convenience of ordering online or calling it in and picking up sandwiches. For months now their online ordering hasn't worked and every time I try and call, their line is busy! It's super frustrating, I always get coupon's emailed to me, but can never use them since their are only redeemable with online ordering! PLEASE fix this!"}
{"text":"I am diagnosing Which Wich with sandwich shop schizophrenia.  One moment you'll think it's the greatest thing in sandwich history and the next moment you'll wonder why it tastes so bland.

Let's break it down this way:
- Meat toppings: delicious, fresh.  Specifically the roast beef and the buffalo chicken.  Simply brilliant.

- Cheese toppings: spot on.  Well done Which Wich!  Specifically, the sharp cheddar (delicious) and the blue cheese (real blue cheese, not blue cheese dressing).

- Veggie toppings: crisp and fresh with real flavor.

- Bread: . . . Alright, Which Wich, let's talk.  You could be the greatest sandwich shop in the world, but your bread is tasteless and uninteresting.  It has ruined more than one sub for me before.  Sometimes I take the filling out of the sub and eat it alone because the bread is so bad.  I've taken to getting the bread toasted to try to hide the lack of flavor.

On the contents of its subs, Which Wich is a sandwich god.  But add in the awful bread and Which Wich ranks behind Capriotti's (which is in a different league from all sub shops) and right behind Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"Things have improved.  Food is still good.  The cashier didn't know about yelp check in offers, but one of the sandwich makers did."}
{"text":"In the peak of 2010's winter solstice, in a land of magical spectacles and bright lights called Las Vegas, Nevada, Yelpers were caught in a weird storm of strange weather and rain that no one really expects in this part of the world.  Rain was as rare as Mr. T wearing silver.  Not only was this storm rare and unusual, but there was a different storm hitting Las Vegas that none knew what to expect from.  The mystical appearances caused a disturbance to find the 'Wich that had it all.  And thus, cause the hunt for the best 'Wich in town!

Which Wich is in the race for the best sandwich shop in Las Vegas!  It's unique menu and ordering methods refresh the Vegas valley with a new taste and flavor that makes ordering sandwiches a definite memorable experience.  As seen in some earlier reviews, you order your 'Wich by choosing one or more bags from the wall of bags.  Different bags correspond what kind of meat comes on the sandwich.  Markers are conveniently located nearby to mark off different toppings, sauces, cheeses, peppers, etc. Go to the cashier, pay for your 'Wich and sit tight because you're moments from enjoying something different!

My GF and I ordered the Wicked (5 MEATS!: Turkey, Bacon, Roast Beef, Ham, and Pepperoni and 3 CHEESES!: Provolone, Cheez Whiz, Pepperjack [choices of Cheddar and Swiss also]) and I'll testify to it's wickedness! It was a bit overwhelming for my GF the way we threw everything on there (see pictures for sandwich details) but for me, it was a medley of all-star tastes! \"Less is more!\" says my GF, Dana Marie Dabu (reviews to come soon but soon to never come!). Try out our combo and let me know what you think! However, the Oreo cookie shake is LEGIT! Add it to your combo for just a few more dollars! You won't be sorry you did. They also have Hershey's Chocolate, and Banana! And, on your way to the restroom, check out the cool customer art section of the walls! I'll have to add my doodles here next time!

I will definitely have to come back to try the rest of their great menu with so much to choose from. Oh, and if you like A1 like I do, they have it! :D"}
{"text":"Ok, I admit that I wasn't excited about this place to begin with. I figured it was just another sandwich shop,  but my boss gave us gift cards for xmas, so I  decoded to try it out. 
Great Zeus' ghost was I wrong! Everything from the cool ordering process (that ensures you get just what you want & nothing you don't), the helpful staff  (who always ask if it's your first time so that you know what the heck is going on), the fresh ingredients & the heaping portions are awesome. Sure, it's a little expensive for a sandwich, but it's darn well worth it! 
I've already been twice and will continue to go back. YOU are a darn fool of you don't give this a try. I'd post a pic but there's nothing left of my Cuban with Swiss, added bacon & dijon mustard. I gobbled that beast up faster than you can say \"Subway doesn't hold a candle! \"
So here's the empty wrapper and the brownie that i'm about to dive headfirst into!"}
{"text":"Many options to choose from. You build it how you want it. They even pull out the extra bread from the center, leaving a flaky outer layer. Great sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"All i can say is Yummm 
My sandwich spot used to be firehouse (firehouse who?) lol.
You create your own sandwich and the way you do it is really cute when you arrive there are brown bags you just got to select your protein and it guides you on what number bag you need to get and you write your name and select all the ingredients you want once you're done filling it out, you place your baggy at the counter where they start preparing your which. If you don't want a sandwich you have the option of doing a spinach wrap or even a salad which I think is amazing."}
{"text":"Way better than I remembered when I first had Which Wich in Fullerton. Over there, they were so skimpy with the meat. Here, both our sandwiches were packed full. The Wicked was the best, with five meats and three cheeses. Also you can add on many different extras and sauces for free, plus some with an upcharge. Horseradish mayo has a nice kick, as does the hot pepper mix. If you get a salty sandwich, adding in cole slaw is a good choice. Wheat bread kinda had a slightly stale texture, so if you want soft airy bread, stick with the white.

Staff was very friendly and as we walked in asked if we had been there before. If not they would help you place your order.

Sign up for their birthday club and get a free sandwich for your birthday! Also on Weds the Wicked is only $5 for a small!"}
{"text":"Always a great sandwich. Way better then any other sub place. This place actually tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Which Wich's  baguette bread is the biz- even better nicely toasted!

I keep coming in for the same crab salad wich but i always change up the sauces, just for experimenting, until I find the cream of' combo.That's what I like about their order swag. Dotting in my own personal votes for building my wich just like at a poll booth during election day; or like Yelp's review rating polls.

I can't believe these folks have tzatziki sauce! Awesome. But they don't have spinach and/or sprouts. I feel indifferent for pointing that out but that's what makes a good gourmet sandwich(to me) plus its nutritional value.

This place is far from a 5 star rating- only because their customer service connection is disconnected. Every visit is like a miserable Monday for them. I saw the cash reg' chick watch a guy come in and was about to greet him but then bailed. Awkward that I had to witness that. And then a group of people came in and monotonously said \"welcome to Which Wich\" 

My \"adhd\" had me imagining how cute it'd be if an r2d2 were to greet me in a robotic voice. Cute right? 

Anyways, the truth is, I'd enjoy this place more if they marched to the beat of a happier drum. Perhaps it's the semi-emo indie music playing above that's altering their aura."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Which Wich but the last three times that I went there, there sandwiches are disgusting. How are they disgusting? They smear all the mustard all over the sandwich on the bread, it's NEVER in the middle of the sandwich. It's always on the bread where it's all soggy even when I asked them to not do that.

Usually the workers are very snobby and they act like you are a pain for asking something so reasonable."}
{"text":"First time here.  Service was outstanding. Everyone was helpful and came out quickly.  I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich.  Very good.  Would recommend this place if your looking for a good sandwich"}
{"text":"Which 'wich indeed, so many choices! Some of my favorites are the black bean patty, and the turkey. I love that you can get a lettuce wrap, and the website has a full list of nutritional information. 

The staff is friendly and they have a rewards program, which I can't tell you about because I never remember to register my card, and always end up losing it and starting over. It's gets busy around lunch time, but there are a few tables outside that are almost always open. 

They have a seltzer option on their soda machine (which for some reason not all places offer) so I always get a large plastic cup....I have quite the classy collection of them now, lol. It's a convenient location, I usually stop by here for a quick lunch if I've been at the Lake Mead/Rainbow LVAC, or more likely scenario, doing some shopping at the Best in the West Plaza. 

Stop by Rita's Italian Ice next door for dessert!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The inside seems to always be dirty! I have to clean off the table before I eat! And the floor always has food on it. The front blind is still broken! Management needs to step up and hold the teenage staff accountable."}
{"text":"An absolute must try on any local's sandwich list. If you are a fan of the Potbelly chain of sandwich shops in the Midwest, East Coast and Texas, you will love Which Wich. (Potbelly one-ups Which Wich by offering a 'thin-cut' option on the wheat bread loaf - cutting out the inside bread leaving only the crust - but that is a fine point.)

The secret ingredient here is the hot pepper mix, which is right out of the Potbelly arsenal. I swear it's the same recipe. You have to try it. It throws your sandwich into a new dimension that the Earl Of Sandwich can't even comprehend. I happen to love the seafood mix which is imitation crab (pollock) and perfectly dressed. Sometimes I get the Surf & Turf which is any meat plus crab (no extra charge). There is also no extra charge for typical 'extra' items like cheese, guacamole, hummus, etc. One price, no surprises. Which Wich gives you Freedom Of Sandwich. The sandwich toaster here runs a perfect medium, unlike the toasters at Quizno's and Firehouse Subs which tend to burn your loaves.

Easy to get to: take 95N to the Lake Mead East / Rainbow North exit, and take Rainbow North right into the parking lot. 

I sound obsessed, but I must stand up for a great sandwich. And this store is consistently good and their service is always friendly and top notch. Get the hot pepper mix on the side if you're scared, just don't forget to get some.

The biggest sandwich here is worth every penny if you're starving. So big it sticks out of the bag 4 or 5 inches. Which Wich? THIS Wich All Day Long.

My favorite fast-food sandwich in Las Vegas by far. (If there were a Potbelly here I would be less convinced. But there's not, so Which Wich it is!)"}
{"text":"Ill be calling the manager in the morning. I love which wich and couldnt wait to take my 12 guests there! Especially for the shakes! And we walked in at 7:38pm on a sunday afternoon to be asked if were getting it to go. So we decided to still eat but take our food outside. Sadly i would be missing the refills of amazing tea they carry but i guess thats ok if i have to miss it. So We wrote up our orders and gave em our 6 milk shakes with our several sandwhich orders and then we were informed they were \" out of milkshakes\" hmm and the trash cans were already covered up with chairs. They arent trying to get out early at all! Or lying about the shakes being out because the machines are cleaned 22 minutes before the already early close. Infact they close earlier than any restaraunt in the whole area. Sad to say i love this place but they have some employees that need training or something. Ill find out in the morning i guess"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Could eat here every single day! Can be a little pricey but it is definitely worth it. Better than most sandwich shops in the area."}
{"text":"Got dinner here last night (8:15 pm) and the two guys working gave A+ service!!!! Sandwiches are as good as it gets! 
Thanks guys, we have a new favorite sammy shop!"}
{"text":"Which Wich is an awesome sandwich shop! I love their approach. It is fun and tasty. The sandwiches are fresh and unique compared to what else is offered today. 

When you first walk in you are greeted by the friendly staff of the location. You then make your way to the board to order. You will grab a novelty brown paper bag and fill out what you would like on your sandwich, its a bubble in bag with fun red sharpie, it could be relaxing if there weren't so many great options. This is GREAT. This ensure that you get exactly what you want. You are not having to repeatedly tell a worker over the glass what you want or reach your nasty little fingers over the barrier to rudely gesture at the vegetables that you need to decorate you sandwich with. This helps keep things sanitary because guess what, the employees know the locations of the veggies and do not need your crusty old fingers over the glass waving around all the fixins' (I AM LOOKING AT YOU PATRONS OF SUBWAY AND CHIPOTLE). 

You then present your order to the cashier who confirms what you want and you ask for the large cup, yes large. This gets you a reusable plastic cup that now litters your cabinets in droves. You do not even bother with regular glasses anymore, this is just better. You are being green and enjoying 32oz of water at a time.  

You take a seat, check your email and try to look important for a bit. They call your name and you receive your glorious custom made sandwich with all accoutrements that you could muster to put on the 10.5 inch sub. 

After enjoying said sandwich you make your way to the cashier once again for dessert. Oh yes. You order the peanut butter cookie which is absolutely flawless. However, you decide that today you are gunna \"treat yo self\" and order the ice cream cookie sandwich. Your sugar level sky rockets and you pass out in your car in a food coma until the proper help arrives and you return to your normal work day filled with regret and sadness that you have to wait until tomorrow to repeat this venture."}
{"text":"Despite the reviews, the sandwiches were not good at all. The meat tasted per packaged and as if it were turning.  Their ordering system is clunky and confusing.  Unfortunately, I can not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried Which Wich today for the first time and was able to use my coupon (free reg sub w/purchase of chips and drink) which I received after signing up for their email/online offers. The sandwich itself deserves 5 stars, however, I'm docking one due to the poor customer service. Maybe these guys were just tired from working the lunch rush, maybe they've had a long day, but in my experience, nothing excuses poor customer service (please also keep in mind, I've too had a long day but was still able to thank you and smile). I've read about their stamp card, but wouldn't know anything else about it since it wasn't offered (and I just remembered as I logged back unto Yelp) :( Maybe next time."}
{"text":"We had lunch here a couple of months ago. 

Which wich has an interesting ordering process where you pick one of numerous sandwich types and customize your wich through marking your cheese, spread, and topping selections on your bag. 

I had an avocado and tomato wich. My wife had a chicken philly and a chocolate and banana shake. 

The food was pretty good and reasonably priced. We also split some homemade chips which were unique and tasty."}
{"text":"Once again, a great meal at our favorite Glendale restaurant, always fresh and great service too!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times. The staff is friendly and the food has been great every time!
4 stars because its about $10 after tax for a medium sandwich with one type of meat. I would go here more if the prices were a bit more competitive with similar restaurants."}
{"text":"I love this place....always delicious and fresh and just the way I order it. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Diana is a sweetheart."}
{"text":"Never been here before very cool how you write your order on the bag. The meatball sandwich was really good could have used a little more sauce but overall a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are great, you'd be hard pressed to find a place that has more toppings, and most places in Vegas don't have giardineira. Downside is that they take a long time to make a sandwich."}
{"text":"I love love love Which Wich. We enjoy sandwiches here often when we go to Westgate and so happy that it continues to do well. The staff is fun and friendly. The process of ordering your sandwich is unique and interesting. The sandwiches though...oh my. They are so yum. The bread is fresh, chewy on the inside, crunchy on the outside. The deli meats are cut when you order the sandwiches and the condiments are just perfect! Whether you get it cold or toasted, you can't go wrong at Which Wich. And try the \"house\" chips. They are seasoned perfectly! :)"}
{"text":"Went across town from Henderson just to get some Which Wich. Wish they had this excellent place on the GVR side of town. The food was delicious and the service was great. I don't know his name but the guy who took care of us was awesome, management should give him some kudos, we went on 8/3 at 11 a.m.

If you want a good sub or grinder stop by this place."}
{"text":"Place is disgusting!!!.....there was a cochroach in my sandwich tuck in between the lettuce when I confronted the manager he played dumb and didn't know what I was talking about ....don't go to this nasty place there not up to health code ...employees don't wear gloves making ur food or hair nets ...the manager didn't want me to go to corporate about this incident I laughed at him and said that be the least of his worries...if all he is worried about is his image of his store what else is he hiding??"}
{"text":"Love which Wich but man did they suck today!! Ordered a turkey with cheese , lettuce, bell peppers, extra mayo and avocado, which they charge a $1.00 for. Could barely find the turkey, the mayo was barely there and the avocado.. hahaha one tiny little slice in each side of sandwich...."}
{"text":"I love this place. If your looking for a great traditional east coast style hoagie or sandwich stop on by. I'm from NJ and think it ranks with my favorite spots in NJ."}
{"text":"Ok.. Our first experience was terrible, I chalked it up to it being a new location/business. That was over a month ago. We gave them a second chance last night.. I wish I hadn't. I ordered the turkey club skinnywhich. Not only did it not have bacon on it, there were so little veggies that it was mostly bread and very dry.. My husband had an Italian and it was basically the same, sparse and dry. We will not return."}
{"text":"I think I might be beyond disappointed in my meal. I ordered online where there is very little room for error given that each detail is in PRINT. I absolutely HATE olives, banana peppers, lettuce etc. I get my sandwich and it literally has whatever they chose to throw on there. I even added a tip while ordering online. Pissed! I had someone pick up my order for me who didn't check it before and now they are closed. I have my order receipt which is furthest from the sandwich I was given. There was another sandwich on my order which had some of those toppings listed but of course it's so jumbled she's equally disappointed. Her order should of had lettuce but has cucumbers. Should of had banana peppers but I have those...she got my mustard though. Really?"}
{"text":"Very average sandwich shop. Definitely worth trying, but for myself I wouldn't consider it a frequent stop. The concept of grabbing a bag and writing what you want was cool, but a little confusing at first. I tried the wicked which was the featured sandwich, and I just felt like I couldn't taste everything I was supposed too. Ham, roast beef, THREE cheeses? All I could taste was the turkey and an occasional hint of Bacon."}
{"text":"First time. Neat concept as far as writing your order on the bag. I tried the turkey with cole slaw n 1000 island dressing. 
Bread is a little dry but the meat was good. Good size portions.  Good place to grab a quick bite at westgate."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My friend brought me and was telling me it was the \"best subs ever\" I didn't believe her.. Then I created my own sub. It was GLORIOUS. I had there house chips and they were so good too. Perfect experience honestly. The only downfall of this place is they don't have one in Henderson !! But best believe I'll be making the drive to eat here again."}
{"text":"I wish they would open more of these in town. Awesome selection of subs. Love how you order by yourself with the marker and brown bag, come to Henderson please!"}
{"text":"My first time here I was just standing there staring at the wall. Even though the guys behind the counter explained everything to me, I still had to take a couple minutes just to decide what I wanted.

Finally I decided to go with the original Philly, which was the #8 bag. Apparently this was their designated product development bag in which they come up with experimental sandwiches. The other bags are other things like chicken, pork, beef, etc.

So you grab a designated numbered bag, check off all your choices on that bag whether its extra or nothing of something. Lastly, don't forget to put your name before you hand it off to the guys behind the counter. Pay and then wait. They put the bags up on a clothes line while they make it. Nice concept. They read what you checked off so there is no mistake. As soon as its done, they put it in your bag and call your name.

Back to my Philly. It was decent. Two things though. It was kind of small with only the one size choice (7 inches) and thought it need some kind of sauce. I asked the guys if they had anything spicy to put in my sandwich. They gave me a small cup of spicy ranch sauce which I should of had them put in my sandwich in the first place.

Overall, I had a good experience. I just thought the sandwich was a bit small. I think next time I will get the \"The Wicked\" sandwich. Based on the pic, it does look pretty wicked with all the different meats up in there.

Yelp 2014 Review Challenge #38"}
{"text":"Our experience between the two times we have been so far was inconsistent. The first time we were greeted and asked if we needed any help, zero personality the second time we went. Their ordering system is really quite clever but the execution needs some work. The person  working the blender for the milkshakes may have been in training but oooh, they were slow. I'm also not a fan of food arriving in stages. I'd like to be able to eat my sandwich, chips and drink at the same time and dessert should come after. Nope, I got my cookie first, my sandwich second and my shake last. Shouldn't it be the other way around?

Now as far as the food goes. No complaints there. I really like the crusty bread, and there are a zillion ways to customize you sandwich, there are even some selections that are not traditional. I like the fact that they have several selections per category, so that if you are sort of wishy washy you have a \"base\" to build your sandwich selection on. They are well put together and I did not have to rearrange the fillings to have maximum flavor coverage as I so often have to do in other establishments. If at the very least every time I drop by Borders I might stop in for a delicious chocolate chip cookie or milkshake.

All in all, a little expensive, food is yummy, service needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"Lots of choices and fresh ingredients. I dont think you can go wrong if you make your own sandwich"}
{"text":"Since \"discovering\" Which Wich? in Albuquerque in 2010, I got my husband hooked in Carlsbad later that year.  And since then, we've been stopping at this Which Wich at least once per visit to his mom's house, not too far from here.  Yes, much like our previously-well-documented-on-Yelp love for Jimmy John's, we actually seek out this sandwich chain, since the nearest one to us is about 35 miles away in a part of SoCal we seldom visit.  And, like JJ, I've eaten WW in three different states.  Sad but true!
So it should be clear from this that we love the concept of Which Wich.  I'll leave that to others to describe.  But what I want to give a shout out to with this store is their really friendly nice staff.  Every single time we've been in, they've been fast, friendly, and make great sandwiches.  Last time we were in, as my last meal before running the Vegas marathon, they were extra friendly and chatty and we had a nice talk while we ate with one of the staffers, who was stamping the bags during slow periods, about running and how crazy marathons seemed.  (Although I was running it, I definitely was agreeing with her.)  I felt special, being wished good luck by a lady who just happened to be ringing me up for my sandwich!  Big props to WW for their friendly service!"}
{"text":"I had this tailgating on Sunday for the cards greenbay game. It was very tasty and had a lot of flavor. One thing was it was a smaller portion than I expected. By the why it's better that any subway or blimpys."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. Very disappointed. Got 2 large sandwiches to go and bring home to my family. They were so bad that my 3 yr old son spit it on the floor. This was my first and last order."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!!!!! Best sandwich I've had in Vegas hands down! Cute concept & Jose was so polite, friendly, & helpful! Only wish it was closer to my side of town! The bread was fresh and perfectly toasted after I ordered mine hot. I love all the spread & sauce options! I got the olive spread, & it definitely is what made my sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Saw this while apartment hunting. It's a very nice sandwich shop. Clean and organized. The ordering process is unique.  One must take a bag and fill out the order yourself which is great cause you can't really get it wrong. I ordered the corned beef with deli mustard and  swiss cheese. The bread is so fresh and they grill it to a crisp perfection. The meat was super tender but kinda flavorless. It tasted more like roast beef instead of corned beef. The middle was cold and I asked for it to be hot. Still the sandwich was perfectly made and tasted scrumptious. The mustard was proportioned well and not overdone.  Perfect balance. I recommend this place most definitly."}
{"text":"Had the Cuban sandwich. Not what I expected for a Cuban. I will need to try something else."}
{"text":"When it comes to franchise sandwich shops in Vegas on a scale from Subway to Capriotti's, I would place Which Wich somewhere closer towards the latter.  As the name implies, this is either a nightmare for the indecisive or a dream for those who crave variety and customization.

Upon walking in, the lady behind the counter was kind enough to ask if I was a W squared newbie or knew how to place my order.  She then directed me to consult the list posted on the wall which indicated several templates for various sandwiches in the form of brown paper bags with a list of items to check off.  From classics (italian, turkey, ham) to the gourmet (surf and turf, buffalo chicken avocado) to the international (cuban, greek, huevos rancheros (what the what?!)) and the truly bizarre (Elvis and Monte Cristo)...you take your red sharpie pen and indicate whether you want your bread toasted in the form of white, wheat, or served in a bowl with croutons, a redonkulous number of toppings, cheeses, and sauces (notables including pesto, fried shoestring onions, sauerkraut, cheese whiz, and hot pepper mix) and then hand it over to the cashier and your sandwich order then arrives within the same brown paper bag ready to nosh.  This is pretty much like a mad scientist sandwich lab for someone trying to craft the world's perfect sandwich...wichcraft one might say!
I also recommend getting their tasty homemade chips seasoned with salt/pepper as a side and I believe there is a nice 10% discount on a combo for first timers if you check in on yelp.   Bonus points for having options for house-made milkshakes and fresh baked cookies!"}
{"text":"I simply ADORE Which Wich. This is my second favorite sandwich place of all time (Sacks is #1) I love the Veggie Tomato/Avocado sandwich. They do not skimp on the avocado!!!  Everything is fresh and delicious. The bread is toasted perfectly. The shakes are outstanding. And I LOVE that they have crushed ice (tiny cubes)!!! The also have mellow yellow which is fun to see on a fountain for some reason. The sandwiches are good sized. The medium is usually too much for me but I order it anyway. I can't get enough of this place. I'm a regular!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet?  OMG, this place is beyond amazing.  Subway who?

Pros:
*  Everything I've tried here is bursting with flavor!  I have yet to discover a bad 'wich.
*  home made chips.  Jared doesn't have that.  Nor does Quizno's.
*  a plethora of toppings/additions available (from Pesto to crispy onion strings).

Cons:
*  It's a bit more pricey in comparison to Subway, but well worth the price.  Honest!
*  seating is a bit limited.  There are outside seats, but it still gets super crowded.
*  service isn't stellar, but whatever.

Overall:
  I highly recommend this place for those that love sandwiches.  Really, you've just gotta try it for yourself.  If you have never been... here's a little heads up:  
Choose your bag and grab a crayon.  Bubble in your choices and viola!  After making your selections and choosing whether you want to make it a combo, watch the sandwich artists clothespin your 'wich bag to a wire and zip-line that baby.  Not making any sense?  Just go in and check it out.  You'll see. 

Tips:
*  Pesto is a must.  
*  Carb-Watching?  You can get any sandwich in a bowl instead.
*  my personal recommendation is the Surf n Turf.  it's roast beef w/ imitation crab."}
{"text":"I waited 17 minutes for my rueben,  and no one was in front of me.  My rueben had No sauerkraut,  and No thousand island on it!  How is that even a rueben! !!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food!  I did get horribly sick immediately after eating the food (before we left!) but it was from fighting the flu, not because of the food. My wife had the BLT and I had a buffalo chicken wrap which wasn't bad. I think the hot pepper mix had a lot of oil which was a bit disappointing. Overall, outside of worshiping the porcelain goddess in the restaurant, it was a decent experience. If I go again and get sick again, I'll send out a warning shot!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this after going to the as they grow sale. A soccer team showed up right before us. The place was packed. These guys were pumping out the sandwiches pretty fast. We are never on this side of town so we checked it out.  It was pretty good.  I got the buffalo chicken sandwich.  I even got a free cookie for checking in.  I wish they had one of these in my neck of woods.  I wouldn't seek this place out, but if  you are in the area it is a must try! Cheers!"}
{"text":"High class subway, delish, but not over the top.  Value is here, taste is here, great quick on the go lunch.  Its build your own, which sometimes, I dont like, I just want you to build me the bomb, and I will eat it, if I gotta make choices, thats too complicated.  You can do both, I guess, but I prefer less than 10 questions when I order lunch.   That said, it was incredible!   Loved it!    Would definitely go again and order my own creation!   For creators, this is your subway stop!  Recommended!  Cheap and good food!   Yummy rating is high!"}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here and the concept of \"building\" your own on the paper bags is fun and unique.  I happened upon Which Wich while working down in Rancho Sante Fe, CA...we ended up eating there for lunch nearly every day.  Then while on a project in Dallas we found one located in the mall...BAM, nearly every lunch was had there too!  The milkshakes are outstanding too...they actually use real ice cream and Hershey's chocolate syrup.  Forget about the chips in the bag from Vicky whoever it is...it's all about the house chips in the brown bag here; get two (they are small and you'll have them gone before your sub arrives).

Too bad there is only one in Vegas...and it is in the most inconvenient area of town for me based on my home and work sites. Oh well...worth the trip here and there.

I also noticed a Rita's Italian Ice is going in next door...that's another reason to force me out of my comfort zone and travel out to Rainbow/95."}
{"text":"Running between meetings I had a couple of minutes to grab something to eat and this place was on the way.  So it's a new idea for a sandwich place, you place your order on the bag that your sandwich will be in.  You don't talk to anyone really about what will or will not be in the sandwich, it's all checkboxes.  Very easy and allowed me to return 2 phone calls while I waited for them to build my custom sandwich.  They were pretty quick on the fulfillment part and the sandwich came out as expected.  Nothing to rave about, other than when in a hurry, it's pretty straight forward and next to nothing to slow the process down."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've never been inside a sandwich place like this before. 

So what's different than other places? They have a variety of sandwiches and salads to choose from, and you can pick which one you would like all from a BAG. You find the bag that matches the meal you want and pick what you'd like on/it by marking it on the bag with a fun colorful marker. It's different and fun! 

The staff was extremely helpful and kind! 

The sandwich I ordered was awesome! There are other ones I would like to try sometime. Try it out, you shouldn't be disappointed. #delicious"}
{"text":"This was the 1st time I went here and loved it!! I'm from Chicago and love this some place called Potbellys and this place tastes a lot like it. 
Customer service was GREAT and the food was GREAT!!! Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, my sandwich is made correctly, the people are friendly and I leave satisfied. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Which wich, why oh why do you only have one location when I could eat so much more of you if you were closer? 
Also, why did it take so many sandwich shops to finally come up with this FREAKIN\" AMAZING concept? 
You choose your bag via your choice of meat; turkey, ham, chicken, roast beef etc. Then write down or check off every single thing you want on it! Want balsamic? No problem! How about olive spread? They have that too. Honey mustard AND spicy mustard, YUP- they can pull it off! 
They also always have a special, most recent was the pastrami. Do yourself a favor and get the VOODOO chips. They taste like barbecue met up with jalapeno and had a salt and vinegar baby. 
Real ice cream shakes, and hot cookies. Do I need to even keep typing? Why are you not there yet? Or at least bookmarking it on Yelp!
They have punch cards, with double punch Mondays. Not once have I had to wait long, or experience anything other than stellar service. My only complaint is the one location, far far away. But it's worth the drive, so they will continue to get my business."}
{"text":"Upgrading Which Wich to a 5. They have continued to deliver delicious, well-crafted sandwiches, and the employees are always very hardworking and helpful, providing suggestions and personal input when desired. Their food is always fresh and well-portioned. The expanding selection of sandwich options is sure to please any craving. Also, their milkshakes are exceptional! One of the best banana malts I've had. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"As I sit here, sandwich done, I am currently waiting on a milkshake that has gone unnoticed on their clothespin line they use to slide orders down on. Their system involves paper bags customers mark with their order, each type of sandwich having their own bag and toppings. Each sandwich type is numbered and the bag holders are numbered accordingly. We used the suspend and ordered two combos totaling 18 bucks. Damn. 

The staff looks flustered, almost as if training was thrown out the window and the manager figured that they'd figure it all out on their own. Subway has a better system and that's saying something. We waited and our names were called out for our orders. 

The sandwiches are in subway type rolls, wrapped in those old fashioned silver hamburger papers and parchment with their logo. They come warm, which is fine. The bread is good but the meat and toppings are just okay. In all honesty I was shocked that my sandwich only had two large slices of turkey sandwich meat. Weird. I chose the cranberry and stuffing version, one I learned to love from another sandwich store. It was okay. The BLT comes with crumbled bacon, although strange it tasted like a BLT. 

Overall, I think because they're new the kinks are still being worked out. I hope that when I return in 6 months the food and service improved."}
{"text":"Really fun sandwich place!  U can really create what ever your craving cough* cough* Elvis Wich I love you!! They also have healthy lettuce wrap version of all sandwiches and alot of vegetarian options 

Only wish the staff was more helpful because the ordering process can be confusing on your first visit. 

Also they have been out of main ingredients on several of my visits..... no bueno"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after the Cardinals game. Went to the Yard House for a beer first and rather than wait for a table for 30 minutes we decided to try out Which Wich; what a great choice that was. The wicked sandwich was wicked huge and the medium was too big to even finish. Only thing is be careful when you're filling out your bag drunk, those marks are taken seriously and when you accidentally put cucumber they put it on there. Put as much as you'd like on, no extra charge for pesto either. Great sandwich, great portions, great price. Not going to be in Glendale much, but definitely will check out the new location on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"During my last visit here, I came around the closing hour (8:30-ish) so I didn't expect a lot of people to be here, or for the staff to even be enthusiastic. 

I ordered the Pepperoni Pizzawich (Pepperoni, Mozzarella, Parmesan) with caramelized onions, mushrooms, garlic, salt, and pepper on a toasted wheat bun. It was pretty good and tasted like I expected. The only downside to this dining experience was that I ordered a hot sandwich but the pepperoni was a little cold in the center. Despite this, my experience here was still pretty good. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and came in because of its concept. Bobby helped us get started.  Explained how everything works, he was extremely  friendly. One of the best customer service we had all week. 

Basically you pick a number or the type of sandwich you like then choose a bag corresponding to that sandwich. you fill out the the bag with a red sharpie , all the ingredients  you wish to put on the sandwich. There's even a  spot to put your name.  It was really neat! 

My wife got the med (10.5 inches) Club.  It has ham ,turkey and bacon she added avocado with provolone , red onions,  lettuce, cucumbers , jalapeños , on a white roll (oil, salt &pepper ) the club was $ 8.50 plus $1.50 for avocado.  

While waiting my wife orders an ice cream sandwich chocolate chip on both sides and vanilla ice cream . It was made fresh, really big & extremely delicious.  It was $ 3.50 and worth every penny. 

I ordered the med size Grinder, it had salami , pepperoni & Capitola with provolone, lettuce , tomatoes, banana peppers & cucumbers  on a white roll (mayo,mustard , oil, vinegar , salt &papper) the grinder was $8.50 

The food was good, the customer service was great.  No complaints"}
{"text":"Good sub shop

I wouldn't say it's my favorite sub shop but it's a go to place to go over subway or blimpie for sure. Kind of a custom 'fast food' resturant. Nice for a quick bite. 

You build your sandwich from a carosel with sandwich bags and magic markers. The bread is fresh, the meats are flavorful, and the veggies selection, is nice.

The service is very quick, the menu is reasonably priced, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. Not a bad choice for a good sub."}
{"text":"I went here because it was easy and I had hoped fast while I was on my lunch break. I was the only customer there so thought I would be in and out. I placed my order and listened to the three workers there complain and gossip about their coworkers, one even said someone needed to work on their customer service. What's funny about that statement is that I watched the person who was supposed to be making my food stand and talk to his coworkers for about 7 minutes. I spent more time staring at him chit chatting then it did to make my simple sandwich. The sandwich was overpriced imo and I could've got a bigger one for less at subway that would've tasted the same. Really disappointed with this experience and wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in before the Coyotes/Stars game on Saturday.

Like everyone else has said you pick your selection from a menu board. There are categories like 'vegetarian', 'salad-wiches', and 'breakfast' (served all day which is cool). Each category has it's own bag. You pick your bag and from there start customizing your sandwich with a red mini Sharpie marker. Lots and lots and lots of options which is pretty cool. At the very bottom of the bag you write your name so they can call you when your sandwich is done.

You hand your bag to the cashier who rings you up and then clips your bag to a wire and sends it on it's way.

I also ordered a banana shake which was pretty darn tasty.

My sandwich had everything I wanted on it and the bread it was on was pretty tasty. 

I'm giving it four stars for the many options available for the sandwiches alone, the cleanliness of the place, and the efficiency of the staff. 

Think it would be a great place to go with a small group that couldn't agree on where to go....of course everyone would have to like sandwiches I guess.

Will definitely go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Subway needs to watch its back. Comparable prices, better quality, and outstanding selection put Which Wich ahead of the game. And might I recommend the Wicked?"}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town. Fresh bread, quality ingredients. South Philly wich is delicious. Meatball sub is good as well."}
{"text":"There are various sandwiches to pick from, but I like \"The Wicked\" the best.

It comes with FIVE meats! Turkey, Ham, Roast Beef, Pepperoni and Bacon!  You can also get extra meat/bacon for an additional charge.

I picked the small sandwich (white bread).  You can choose if you want your sandwich cold or hot.  I picked hot.  And size small, which is still seven inches, so it's not THAT small.

Anyone ordering can also make it a hot sandwich or a cold one.  I find that very convenient due to the Las Vegas weather (being in the desert, super hot, then super cold....).

\"The Wicked\" also comes with three cheeses!  My favorites are Cheddar, Pepper Jack and I should have tried Cheez Whiz (but probably nothing like Pat's Cheesesteaks in Philly) so I decided to skip it.  I should have at least tried, there's always next time....

You are allowed to choose sauces and spreads.  I thought a Mediterranean twist would taste great.  So I chose Pesto and Olive Salad.  I skipped the various mustard selection and went straight for the horseradish mayo.  I also added crispy onion strings, and it gave the sandwich a nice little crunch.

So sort of sticking with my \"sort of\" Mediterranean sandwich, I also added spinach, tomatoes, bell peppers and mushrooms. 

I wish that I had put oil and vinegar, I was in a hurry and forgot.  Bur regardless, \"The Wicked\" sandwich is tasty and will fill you up.  I bought a small one and it was quite filling.

Since you pick out your own bag for what sandwich you want, anyone can get what they want.  Wonderful, right?  And YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"The employees are phenomenal here! This was my first time here and the cashier explained everything and she was so nice. The guy making the sandwiches even chimed in. I would literally just come here for the service but my sandwich was sooooo good. Buffalo chicken sandwich.. try it, thank me later."}
{"text":"Using a restaurant.com certificate, spend $20, get $10 off.  Located in a squeezed in shopping area.  Interesting concept on how to order, took me a while to figure it out.  I went for the med. crab sandwich, hubby tried the Philly cheese special.  The gal who took our order was very patient and helped us try and meet our $20 max.  We ordered a milkshake only to be told they'd run out off ice cream.  Great.  We thought we'd added a soda, but with the disappointment of no shake we added extra meat to the Philly and a bag of chips, reaching a total of $20 even. I wasn't sure what to add to mine, so I went minimal: mayo, salt/pepper, red onions.  On the bag for the Philly, it stated cheese whiz, caramelized onions in parentheses, so you'd think this was standard.  Not!  Since we didn't mark these specifics, none of these were added to the sandwich!  Not even the mushrooms we DID MARK on the bag were present, though they did add the extra meat. Philly cheese with no cheese?  Their breads are long, so you think you're getting this huge sandwich, but they're narrow, so don't envision a fatty like from Togo's.  Don't think we'll be back as hubby was VERY disappointed.  Good thing we only spent $10."}
{"text":"Had an incredible sub from Which Wich tonight. Actually, it was one of the best subs that I have had. Filled to the brim with added choices,and all delicious. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop in Vegas. Only problem is it's a 30 min drive to get there. The Wicked is ridiculously good and there's a large selection of toppings and dressings that you can add free."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I LOVE sandwiches. If I don't feel like cooking dinner, a sandwich will always fill the void.

The sandwiches here were not really a step above what I could do at home, they are more akin to Subway quality than Earl of Sandwich.

Prices-Meh Quality-Meh Overall-Meh"}
{"text":"Sunday sandwich improv artists... Running low on supplies today(busy saturday...just goes to show you how legit this place is) had to make some substitutions but with so many options, you are bound to create a masterpiece even if you dont intend to. Thanks Allison!, Thanks Alec & Val you rock! Always great service and great wiches. Keep it up."}
{"text":"I have been curious about Which Wich for a while and actually tried it today.  I've been to places where you write down all the goods and hand your paper to them, but somehow writing on a bag it makes it so much better.  :)  The staff was friendly (maybe too...) and sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"So let's see.....your hungry.....you want an awesome sandwich.....Buffalo Chicken....Cheddar Cheese.....Chipotle Mayo......on Toasted Wheat Bread. Sounds great right....but how about I add the fact that you can simply take a Sharpie....mark all these items on a brown bag and hand it to the cashier. You can also use the same method for for ordering cookies or your favorite shake. The sandwiches are the star at this establishment though and the concept is in a word is.....LEGENDARY....LOL!!! The sandwiches come in 7 inch.....10.5 inches and 14 inches. They also have combos which is what I had the day I visited. I had the Large combo which comes with a 10.5 inch sandwich....bag of chips and 32 oz drink with free refills. All of this delicious food and drink for only 10 bucks tax not included. I wouldn't recommend driving a long distance for this great concept.....as well as the food...but if your near one don't hesitate to treat yourself. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife went and checked this sandwich shop out the other night. I had the cheese steak and my wife had thier version of the holidays Turkey sandwich. The food was very mediocre at best. We had a few bites the decided to go to capriottis. I would put this sandwich shop in the bottom with all of the fast food sandwich shops. If your looking for signature sandwiches that set themselves apart from the rest of the pack this not the sandwich shop for you."}
{"text":"Which Wich has always been and always will be my favorite place to get a sandwich.. The way you order is so simple and you get to customize your sandwich however you want, then after giving them your order the sandwich comes out so fast and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Tasty sandwich with lots of add-on's available, however the ordering system is bizarre.  I did like that I could choose healthy add-on's, such as spinach, mushroom and onion.  I also like that you have a choice of having your sandwich served hot or cold.  The location itself is really small and on a 100+ degree day, it was tough to get a seat for 2 people.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I wish Which Wich was close to my house, because it is one of my favorite sandwich places in Vegas. My kids love going there and filling out their orders on their own sandwich bags. Everything I have ever had at WhichWich has been delicious. Great, fresh bread, meats and fixins. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So very, very...average.

Average size. Below average meat (always beware when 'extra meat' is an option--it implies the base sandwich is unsatisfyingly low on meat and that is true here!).  An extra dollar for avocado gets you...not much avocado. 

And 'toasting' the sandwiches is not so special. Some sandwiches do not née to be warmed (turkey is one) and when the lettuce is warmed, well, blah. Really who wants warm lettuce?

When all this is served up by sullen teenagers...well, look further if you can!"}
{"text":"Hey this is a great place for a sandi if you planning to see an event an event at Westgate!   It's a creative way to create \"which wich\" or what we call a sandi, you are craving for.   They offer a variety of proteins to choose from and/or you create a veggie sandwich!  The kiddos and adult enjoy their process of selecting what they want on a paper bag using a sharpie.  They offer homemade chips or sun chips ~ both are great options to choose with your sandwich.  

Some tips; check to see if they are offering a Yelp check in!  When we were there last, we received a free homemade cookie that was delish!  If you're feeling artistic, get creative using one of their sharpies and decorate your brown bag.  Hang it next to some of the other local artist renderings and enjoy your master epic :-)"}
{"text":"We stopped by and tried the Wicked wich. Ha. Play on words? I suppose, but either way, a pretty decent sub. On par with the wiches at Firehouse and Jersey Mikes; all a step up from Subway. Which Wich has a fun little theme, wherein you mark your paper lunch sack with the instructions for how you want your wich crafted (ooh, play on words!)

Last but not least, they hook their club members up with a free 6 inch on/around their birthday. Much appreciated."}
{"text":"the staff was friendly and helpful since it was my first time there. i like the concept and complete customization. i got the pesto chicken on wheat with veggies and avocado. yummm. the price isnt bad either!"}
{"text":"Cool concept but a tad bit overwhelming! The issue I have with which wich is too many dang options.

I wanted a turkey sandwich and accidentally picked the wrong bag and ended up with some 5 meat concoction. (Unfortunately, I didn't check before leaving so I had to roll with it.)

Overall this is an average sandwich spot but I think I would prefer Port of Subs over Which Wich."}
{"text":"It is pretty rare that an overall Yelp rating is actually spot on for a restaurant but this place is a definite rarity in itself.

The ordering system is a bit confusing for a Which Wich virgin but once you get the hang out it it all makes sense. Sadly, the customer service aspect has been taken out of the equation because of the ordering which makes it seem a bit robotic.

The option to have combos with a milkshake is a pretty cool touch and my buddy said his banana/chocolate milkshake was delicious. Any place where you can customize your options to your exact specifications makes me happy in the pants. 3.5 stars for you Which Wich. Your name on the other hand.....10 stars!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to this shop.  I pride myself being somewhat of a sandwich connoisseur so I was excited to try this place out.  I enjoyed being able to write what I would like on the sandwich bag. I was a little disappointed that the gyro was unavailable. 

We put in our order and waited.  While we were waiting the staff proceeded to talk with their friends who were just hanging out in the store.  The friends were in the food area when he was making our food and running around chasing one of the girls who worked there.  We ended up waiting around 15-20 minutes for our sandwiches and we were the only customers in the store.  It just seems like a poorly managed establishment.  I felt really uncomfortable being in there.

The food was ok.  Nothing compared to Capriottis."}
{"text":"Wandered in here while we were at Westgate, and this place is pretty awesome. I had a toasted Elvis sandwich (peanut butter, honey, banana, bacon) and it was delicious even if it did taste more like dessert than lunch. Hubby had an Italian meat sandwich and loved his as well. I like the different size options for sandwiches, and the prices seemed reasonable enough. The cookies were good and fresh, or at least served warm, and the service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Totally yummy food. Better than Subway or Quiznos. Reminds me of a place I used to love in DC called \"Pot Belly Sandwich Works\""}
{"text":"I have to agree 100% with Charly, the staff was inexperienced, or based off the interaction with Osmar.

Let me tell you about my first/last experience at this place.

You start by grabbing a paper bag and filling out the form, for how you want you sandwich prepared.  *you must read EVERYTHING very carefully because nothing was explained to me.

I ordered 3 total sandwiches. First was a steak and cheese..  I conversed about the cheese on a steak and cheese and ordered my sandwich.

Next;  I made the mistake of ordering a large, with double meat and double cheese.  This ONE sandwich was $17 dollars!!!!  Whaaaat!!!  $17 for a sandwich?? No drink/no chips or anything else!!!!  WTF, still pissed but didn't realize till after I left the joint!  

Also, the cash register doesn't show you the cost of anything as it gets rung up.

Third sub, basic ham and cheese.

As I sit  at a table, and wait for my subs, I realize my elbows are on top of breadcrumbs, lettuce and whatever else and was disgusting.  

I start looking around because the table is so disgusting, I see that they have a #8 sandwich, and it's steak and cheese!  Same as sub 1.

Never was it even mentioned to me, even after asking about the cheese on the steak and cheese, but no 'hey, that's a special' or anything like that.

Get home to discover the steak and cheese, included onions.  Again, it was never mentioned.

Avoid this confusing place and stick to the norm!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I give it an A-OK for effort. I got a message from a Manager sincerely apologetic for my experience. I was offered a free sub and I figure the least I can do is give it a 4th try since the Manager made the effort.
I do appreciate that.
I will take a friend that hasn't been to Which Wich before and then we can both give it an honest review again.
Wish us luck!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. If you are hungry they are your place. Service is terrific. Not the cheapest sandwich, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are phenomenal, but the service was terrible, placed two orders for sandwiches and they weren't done at the same time, one came out 10 mins after the first, and then when we go to ask the girl making it behind the counter if it would be much longer, she gave my girlfriend entirely too much attitude."}
{"text":"I found a wood chip in my sandwich and when I brought it to their attention they apologized, but didn't seem too terribly concerned. I told them what was on my sandwich so it could be cleaned out, but I'm not confident that happened."}
{"text":"I tried this place again after the manager reached out to me after my original review.  First of all, let me say that the service there on 11/8 at around 1:30 p.m. was great. Both of the people working there were friendly and helpful.  

I ordered a turkey sandwich with mayo and dijon mustard, pepper jack cheese and pretty much all of the vegetables. Their bread was nice and fresh and the turkey was quality meat. All I could taste was the mustard though, so I can't comment on the overall taste.  One thing that stood out was the quality. This isn't Subway/Port of Subs etc. Let's not even mention Quiznos. 

I got the house chips, which I kind of thought that they would make there, but they seem to be just regular ridged potato chips. They remind me of some that I got from Trader Joe's or Fresh and Easy, salt and pepper chips. They have a slightly lemony or limey taste too, which is pretty good. 

Their drink selection is OK.  I have never had Mello Yello and I am not really a soda drinker, so I went with the iced tea, which is obviously from a mix, the Gold Peak kind, which is OK. Their mix was a little off on the tea.  Freshly made real iced tea would have added a star. If you are a soda drinker, know that they have Diet Coke, not Coke Zero. 

I feel like the prices are really reasonable - It was under $10 for my sandwich, chips, and a drink in a reusable cup.  

I would definitely not avoid it, but I didn't love it.  I am planning to try it again to have their salad."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food. It's overpriced by a dollar or two but it's good food. 

The issue is cleanliness. We went in at 2, and there were a lot of tables open but they weren't clean. They had food bits all over them. When I cleaned it myself, with a paper towel it made it worse. The second table was easier to clean myself and I just set more paper towels down on the table. 

When I went to use the bathroom, it smelled like a fish tank at a pet store. It needs to be cleaned. The restaurant needs to be cleaned. Just... please clean it."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with the service. I normally love this place but after today I'm done going there. They forgot to make my son meal and when we told them they made 7 more sandwiches before my sons meat wraps. My husband had a chicken parmigiana and they put turkey. Very unhappy and will not be going back."}

{"text":"We had to get sandwiches the other day, it was the first time I had been here. I love the set up, the employees were all wonderfully friendly and helpful, they were very quick and the dinning area was very clean. Definitely worthy of checking out if you haven't."}
{"text":"grab a bag
choose your sandwich
check that box on the bag
choose your condiments
then check those boxes
choose your bread
then check that box
choose your toppings
then check those boxes

.. hand that bag to the guy behind the counter.. he makes your sandwich and then puts your sandwich in the bag. how novel

sandwich could have been better."}
{"text":"The place atmosphere was great. Really loved the way you can make your own sandwich and just pretty have it any way you want it. The worker that was helping us was really informative and walked us step by step on how to create a sandwich. It was pretty good! I got the bbq chicken and coleslaw with pretty much all the fixings. It wasn't \"the best sandwich in the world\" but it was a good eat."}
{"text":"I visited here for the first time the other night only because it was right beside the barber shop. Just in the right place at the right time. After my hair cut I walked it and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff. One of the gilrs asked me if I had ever been here and I said \"No\". She was quick to explain the menu and how it all works which was great. I probably would have been looking at it for hours. I orderd the philly cheese steak as they recommend as the best sandwich. I was very impressed with my meal. It seemed a little over priced as I paid 12 dollars for the combo but I guess you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Last sunday I was out with my Brother in Law and one of his friends and no one could decide on where to eat lunch.  we were downtown coming back from mesa.  and decided to come back to the west valley because we know the area.  His friend suggests Which Wich.  Which I've never had (that's a lot of which's) so we show up at westgate and I'm immediately bombarded with a world of sandwich possibilites not yet known to me.  I like the concept of using the sandwich bag to write down your order and customize it.  not sure how the food is I be safe and order a muffeletta nurturing my love affair with all things olive, I even checked the box next to black olives, so I'd be getting olives on top of my olives.  When in line I notice they have their own kind of natural/home made chips, so I pick up a bag.

first I tried the chips and found they were nice and crunchy as well as perfectly seasoned.

the sandwich wasn't the best I've ever had, but was still very good, the Olive tampenade spread was a bit lacking and thinly applied., but the sandwich was well prepared and still very tasty.  the sandwiches are only about 8 inches so if you've got your A-game appetite go somewhere else or order 2, otherwise good size for lunch.

They advertised a surf and turf sandwich with roast beef and seafood, maybe next time I'll be bold enough to try it."}
{"text":"Which which is so delicious when I went there I never thought it was going to be is good as I thought it was a little pricey but you get what you pay for this place is delicious worth every penny"}
{"text":"It was my first time going there last night and I was so confused.... no one helped me or my bf figure out what we were looking at with all the bags, markers, numbers, and choices.... we're not the brightest couple ha but we figured it out and I was pleased with my order ^.^ all the vegetables were very fresh I couldn't really taste the pesto on the chicken but I order some on the side so it was fine. I would go there again ;)"}
{"text":"This has to be the Worst sandwich I've ever had I ordered chicken salad  it was big chunks of chicken and mayo That's it! Not chicken salad at all and we got the Club So much mustard it was dripping out ridiculous and the guy making the sandwiches was just rude looked like he didn't want to be there my sandwiches look it too slopped together first visit for us will definitely be The Last"}
{"text":"What the hell happen? I loved this place the first time, now service is slow, the dinning area looked like a school lunchroom mess, and my sandwich almost had some meat on it. What a disappointment in consistency. Not sure I'll be back, but sure glad I got a phone survey on the receipt. Hopefully an a$$ reaming on the review will do some good."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch almost everyday since it's in my plaza. Best sandwiches in town. My personal favorite is The Wicked! I recommend."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the neighborhood I stop by and have a pepperoni pizza which.  It is strange since for that price, I can get a pizza...but I still come back for the sandwich :)"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Love their Philly cheesesteak you could have it original with provolone or the South Philly Way with cheese whiz. If you enjoy subs and you like to make it the way you prefer this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Customized sandwich!

I got a roast beef sandwich for lunch one day and I love how they give you the option to choose a lettuce wrap instead of buns. For those of us that are watching our carb intake very closely, this makes a huge difference. 

The sandwich was toasted and flavorful, service was decent, and the shop was pretty clean. Easy parking and clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today, the system was really easy to figure out, but the lady in front of me didnt seem to think so. My sandwich was really good even though i F'd up and added mayo and mustard, forgetting it comes with thousand island on it. so besides the sauce overload, the turkey tasted great, the bread was warm and toasty. Next time i'll try a milkshake since everyone else that was there was getting one. I took off a star because I wish they had soup."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm upgrading this Sandwich joint to 5 Stars.....why?  Here's why:

I stopped in for lunch and saw their recommended Sandwich of the Week.....a Nachowich (Black Bean Patty, Cheese Whiz, Salsa, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Avocado)....total with tax & a bag of Chips, $7.95.  It pique'd my interest and went for it, despite not being a Vegetarian.  Of course I added a few things....Pepper Jack Cheese & Hot Pepper Mix.

After a short wait, they called my name and out came my Nachowich.....I took one bite and was in Heaven!  Damn, that's a great Sandwich!  As I said before, I'm not a Vegetarian and unless I'm fasting, I rarely order a Veggie dish.....but took a chance on this recommendation and loved it!  It left me wanting more....I should have went for a 14\" bad boy in this 'Wich!

They deserve the 1 Star bump.

Will I return?  Now I know where to go when I do my annual fast....you can bet on it!"}
{"text":"I had my first Which Wich experience in Dallas back in 2006. Imagine my excitement last week when we found this Which Wich outside Jobing.com Arena. I love the concept of this place. There are over 50 different sandwich combinations at Which Wich. You pick up a bag and mark options with a Sharpie to get a sandwich customized to your liking. Your sandwich is served to you in the bag when it's complete. All the subs are $5. I love the banana shake at Which Wich also. It really hits the spot. This time I chose a chicken parmigiana sandwich that was really good. 

This Which Wich was very clean, had Phoenix related vibes on the wall, and a friendly staff. Vibes are the large circular pieces of art on the wall. They can be different at every Which Wich location. It's simply a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"I asked my boyfriend if I should give them a 4 or 5 star rating and he says, \"of course a 5!\" So that settles it. We've gone here over 10 times, probably closer to 20, in the past few months and 9 times out of 10 the service is awesome. We have come here right before they closed once or twice and it wasn't the greatest.

Every time we go, we both get the same thing. He gets his chicken cordon bleu with house chips, hot peppers, crispy onion strings plus all of the normal goodies. I get the veggie with avocado, house chips, and crispy onion strings and all of the other normal goodies. We always share chips. The small sandwich is enough to fill me up and have extra while my boyfriend eats all of his.

Like I said, normally the service is pretty awesome and the wait is worth it for a delicious sandwich. They have a punch card and there's double punch Monday! Pretty much awesome. We will always be coming back."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place dozens of times and read some reviews. Decided to try it out. i like the fact that you can grab your bag and mark exactly what you want on your sandwich. Had their Italian Grinder(salami, pepperoni, & capicola), hot. Overall i was pretty impressed. Nice guys working, and will probably be back. Better option than Capriotti's, Firehouse, Subway, Jimmy John's, and Port O' Subs."}
{"text":"Ok. we had an hour before our movie and decided to go here and eat. 
I thought food tasted OK. Just Ok.

Negatives:
- Portion size made this a  no deal !  I paid $2.50 for \"double meat\"  on TOP of the $7 for a small ham and bacon,   good thing I did, because there was BARELY any meat on it and certainly not enough to make this a $10 sub.... add another $2 for a bag of chips and soda.
-Wife said she couldn't taste any meat at all and should have just bought the veggie sandwich..
-she also said it was bland and she wouldn't go back.

Plusses:
-it about the cheapest meal at Westgate without \"dining\" on movie theater food. (which is unhealthy and expensive.)
- You choose your toppings and they were very fresh.
- You order by using a sharpie to fill out a brown paper bag, when is delivered with your sandwich in it...kind of a neat gimmick, especially if you are there with Kids or adults with ADHD:)
- Bread was good crisp on outside but didn't break your jaw chewing.
-There was absolutely NO sign of Justin Bieber in this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Learned about it in California, so glad there is one close to me out here in Arizona. I like this place more than Subway. The sandwichs here are much better for they grill them, and the customization of these sandwichs fit way better than Subways. Sorry Subway, I had to change."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but the sandwich was so delicious! Very friendly when you walk in. The lady at the register asked if it was my 1st time so she could assist me but it wasn't."}
{"text":"A true custom sandwhich. I get the pepperoni, mozzarella, and tomato sauce  one everytime. I guess it's really just like ordering pizza but there is something so good about I can't get myself to order anything different. I also get a cookie that they heat up for you sooo yummy!! Fresh hot cookies!!"}
{"text":"Move over Subway! I discovered Which Which a few months back and go there at least once a week. They have so many different types of sandwich combinations. The loyalty program is a real plus for me too and I'll randomly get coupons emailed to me for free drinks, chips, and cookies! The staff has always been really friendly every time I go in. I would definitely recommend this place if you're around Westgate and you're looking for some grub."}
{"text":"I first discovered Which Wich in San Diego when I was visiting Pacific Beach. I loved it! Imagine mu excitement when I found out there was one opened in Vegas! 

The sandwiches are good! I love the hot pepper mix and the spicy mayo!!! Yummy! It's such a great concept to be able to create a sandwich with so many options of toppings. 

The problem with the one in Vegas is the piss poor customer service. I strolled in at about 11am and I was the only customer. The young male worker looked up and looked away from me not even verbally greeting me or asking if I needed help. I already knew the system so I didn't need help but really? Then when I filled out the info on my bag, I turned around to hand it to the kid who was NO LONGER THERE!! I literally had to say \"hello? Anyone there?\" A female employee came out and looked extremely annoyed, took my bag and my money and told me to have a seat. 

The thing that impressed me the most about the Which Wich in SD was the sparkling personalities. If I wanna pay 7 bucks for a sandwich, even if it's a really good sandwich, I don't want to appear as if I am a nuisance to the workers. 

Suggestions for the Which Wich employees: Greet the customer by saying, \"Hi, welcome to Which Wich! If you need assistance let me know.\" or something of that nature. Please for the love of God don't piss off your customers because you will not last long in this town. Especially since the location you are at is a failed Starbucks."}
{"text":"We stopped by last night with some relatives from out of State. It was our first time eating there. 

I like the concept of grabbing your bag and selecting all your ingredients. Very neat. Lots of options to customize your sandwich, which is great.

I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and added some spinach, onions, cheese and tomatoes. It was good but it wasn't great. The bread wasn't as yummy as Subway's and the pesto itself... I'm almost positive they get it from Sam's club supplier because I make my own chicken pesto sandwiches at home and it tasted just like the pesto I had last night. It's $9 for a 10.5 inch sandwich so it isn't \"inexpensive\", really.

Overall, it's an alright place to grab a sandwich but it isn't great. I still like Subway much better."}
{"text":"I'm digging which wich.  It is a speedy, tasty lunch spot for a good sandwich.  You'll never get bored building with so many options!  It is definitely better than a subway or anything like that.  

I've tried the muffalata and the french dip.  You really can't do to much complaining because, after all, you are the one who creates the sandwich!

My only real complaint is the small portion of cheese.  I felt it was so thin on my big yummy sandwich I could harldy spot it.  

Regardless, I 'll go back and try another concoction.  There is always some sort of check in offer so take advantage.

Most important: DO NOT skip the cookie. It is served warm and chewy and gooey and utterly perfect.  It is worth the trip just for the cookie!  AMAZING."}
{"text":"Choices!! And lots of them! I'm a picky eater with my sandwiches and it's what I want.  I was amazed by the system they have in creating your choices. Starting with an easy 1-2-3 process to get your own personal sandwich.  1st off, what kind of meat and/or sandwich are you craving? Then you grab a bag that corresponds to the type of sandwich you want.  It actually looks like a scan-tron form that you receive back in High school.  It's a little over whelming when you first see it, but at the same time it was really exciting to see what they had to offer.  So I bubbled in all my selections and once that was done, I went to go and pay for it.  I was anxiously waiting for my sandwich on the other end.  

As i was waiting and looking around the little sandwich shop and notice how small this place really was and engulfed with yellow.  I guess it was a fairly decent size as other sandwich shops are. I'm just glad that I was able to go during an off time, cause right after I ordered people piled in.  

The sandwich:  It was delicious!! The bread was nice and toasty, with a tasty crunch and full of flavor.  I was pleased at the choices, and the quality of the sandwich. This was my first encounter with this shop and won't be the last!! ^_^"}
{"text":"First visit here and they greet you and ask if it's your first time here. I said yes and quickly learned why. You practically have to take a quick course in how to order your sandwich. So I grabbed my bag and marked what I wanted on it. My sandwich maker was a nice guy and said \"You'll like our sandwiches!\" And he's right, mine was very good. Which Wich is a niche between a Capriottis and Port of Sub. So I have no complaints. I found the location to be clean with a warm atmosphere 

I'll be back! Thanks"}
{"text":"WICKED!!

That's my usual order when I hit up Which Wich.  Consist of Turkey, Roast Beef, Ham, Pepperoni, and Bacon. I usually get this in a regular, but have placed a double down on the meat when I'm really fiending for protein.  Simply delicious and will keep you full for at least the next couple of hours.

What sets Which Wich apart from the rest of the so called sandwich shops is the ordering process.  You grab a bag based on the type of sandwich you're going to devour shortly.

The bags are labeled Ham/Pork, Beef, Chicken, Seafood, Vegetarian, Italian, Comfort, Classics, Breakfast, and The Wicked.  Prices are $5.75 for a 7\", $7.25 for a 10.5\", and $9.25 for their 14\".  

On the bag is your dream come true check off list.  Here is where YOU choose the type bread you want, condiments, extras, cold/hot, etc.  You go in line, hand them your completed checklist, pay, and then they stick your bag on a clip/wire (Hooters Style).  Sandwich is completed and it's put inside the bag you just filled out.  Simple and it actually keeps the lines down. Food is fresh here.  So, if your sandwich is worse than par, it's really your fault because you technically created your own sandwich.  

My only issue with their sandwiches is the bread.  Their bread is a bit thick or bready if that makes any sense.  I keep on forgetting, but need to find out if the option for \"Skinny my Wich\" means a lighter bread.  

Service is hit or miss.  I've had excellent service and most recently witnessed some bad service.  The cashier was having register issues and taking it out on the rest of the team.  My thoughts?...Which Witch!!!  This is not something that will keep me away.  Everyone is entitled to a bad day every once in a while.  

TIP:  Restaurant is little cramped and during the summer the windows work like magnifier glasses which burn you up.  Eat Outside = Problem Solved."}
{"text":"Not sure if I am the only person, but I find the whole ordering process here a tad annoying.  You pick out a brown paper bag based upon the sandwich you choose and then proceed to take a test about what you will be eating. After a few trips, I finally think I've figured out how to fully bubble in the appropriate circles for the toppings of my choice, but I still have scan-tron flashbacks everytime I order.  While I appreciate the effort to come up with an inventive concept, all those standardized tests may have scarred me for life, but I digress.

The sandwiches here are solid and a nice change of pace from Subway.  I feel singlehandedly responsible for the rapid growth of that franchise, but even I have a limit to how many times I can eat Subway in a month.  The Wicked looks pretty awesome, but my diet keeps me eating the sandwiches which are conveniently marked \"LITE.\"  I've enjoyed everything I've ever eaten here.  The bacon here (okay, I cheated once and got some) is actually bacon bits and better than it sounds.   If you like spicy, do yourself a favor and order the hot pepper mix on any sandwich and don't forget to grab a handful of paper towels before you cop a squat."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was horrible. Our servers name was Destiny. There was 2 servers on the floor. No one wanted to touch the counter. No one checked on us. Several people left. Both servers kept going to the bathroom. I have been a server and have 9 yrs customer service experience and felt horrible about bringing my self and my husband in to eat. This was my first time there and I never want to return. They need to focus on the task at hand and take care of the people in the building. Not run around and ignore people. Their tip could have existed if they took care of us."}
{"text":"The service started slow.  Tuesdays are generally the slowest days for fast food.  They are attentive though.  Seating is plentiful.  A lot of higher seats so if you have leg issues or are short, you might be outta luck.  Food is pretty good.  Ultimate BLT is tasty.  A lot or bacon.  I've done the Reuben here and the Thanksgiving sandwich (not as satisfying if you are expecting the Bobbie).  Menu has expanded greatly though over the years.  Deserts and shakes more.  I will be trying those out some time"}
{"text":"We had the chicken pesto and meatball with carmelized onions. The sandwiches were great. I think they are a little pricey."}
{"text":"I had heard the sandwiches were good at this place so I thought I would stop in and try it. Right away, I saw a photo of one that looked tasty and....wth?  How the heck do you order?  Ok, I see folks checking on a bag so I grab one and find a pen...Dang, I should have brought in my reading glasses because I'm going cross eyed trying to read the bag to check what I want - I didn't know I would have to take a test to order a sandwich!  I want the one I saw in he photo!  After getting my sandwich accessories finally picked out, I couldn't find where to check what kind of meat I wanted...now I'm feeling like an idiot and the line behind me is starting to get longer...  I left this first time without ordering however, I tried again with the kids and someone was directing ordering traffic this time and we figured it out and the sandwich was very good. You have to wait a long time to get it made but it's tasty. Overall this is a once two star experience now a tree star due to being a veteran order now and the product tasting good. However, it's still cumbersome to order and you have to wait by comparison to other sandwich shops a while for your order"}
{"text":"I have been to Which Wich several times and I always enjoy their delicious sandwiches.  They have your normal sandwiches that you find at all of the sandwich shops, as well as some fun one like the Monte Cristo that comes with grape jelly.  Yummy! 

I find the quality of these sandwiches are quite high and I am always delightfully full after having lunch here.  Each sandwich is made to your specifications right when you order.  If you want fun options like flavored mayo, interesting toppings, sauces, and even onion choices (though is there really a choice when crispy onions are available) this is your spot!

I also like the ordering system here.  You pick a bag that corresponds to your sandwich and you mark exactly what you want on said sandwich.  This way there is no mistakes or nastiness like a yucky olive sneaking in if you didn't ask for them.  You put your name on the bag and turn it in to the cashier.  When you get your bag back, it is filled with delightfulness!

The prices are great too.  You can get a full combo meal of a regular sandwich, chips, and a drink for $8.  I am always stuffed with this size, but there are bigger ones too for larger appetites.  They have an email club as well that you can sign up for.  They will email all sorts of coupons pretty regularly to save you even more $$$.  They also have a Yelp check in freebie too, so go check them out and get a great sandwich!"}
{"text":"Four and a half months have passed since I had my awful experience at Which Wich.  After my last review update I received a message from a manager offering apologies for the poor experience I had and explained there was a recent staffing change.  I was encouraged to give it another try.  It took me four and a half months to get back but I did.

Last night I was craving a meatball sandwich and knew Which Wich to have a good one in the past.  I ordered a 10.5\" on wheat with mozzarella cheese, marinara sauce, black olives, pickles, bell pepper, caramelized onions, spinach, mushrooms and oregano.  Everything was on it this time!  And it was delicious.  Service was good and never once did all the employees leave in the middle of making a sandwich.  There were actually as many as three people behind the counter at one time.  Service was only slowed by the customer in front of me who could not figure out what to order.  Couldn't find her credit card.  Seemed in a hurry and then took a phone call and left the restaurant as they tried to give her the sandwich she was in such a hurry for.  The cashier and I had a good chuckle over that one. 

I had a much better experience this time around.  Maybe now it wont take an act of email and four and a half months to get back for my next visit."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite before the Radiohead concert at Jobing. I got the chicken pesto sandwich with mozzarella and veggies. I was expecting actual grilled chicken breast, but it was deli roll chicken. Not a huge deal, it still tasted good. I guess I expected more for the price. The sub roll was nice and fluffy, you can get it toasted if you prefer. I also had a brownie which was pretty tasty. Overall the service was good, but I think their ordering system is kind of a cluster. There are only about 10 tables inside, which was nowhere near enough to contain the masses of people in line pre-concert. There is some overflow seating outside. If I lived in the area I'd probably hit this place up again."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice.  The first time was when it first opened.  It was confusing and the staff was inexperienced.  I went back to give it a second chance.  I feel like the store is new and clean.  On the downside, it was overpriced for what I received.  There was nothing special about the sandwich.  I could have gotten a better sandwich at a better price close by at Jersey's Mikes and I wouldn't have to write on a brown paper bag with a Sharpie marker to place my order."}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would try out this new sandwich shop. After we wrote our order on paper bags and received our food, that's when the disappointment set in. We both order two different types of chicken sandwiches. At first we thought they forgot the chicken. We literally had to open the sandwich to find the chicken. They only gave us one thinly sliced piece of chicken! There was more ham on my husband's chicken cordon beau sandwich then chicken! Subway gives you chucks of chicken! Then there was barerly any sauce on my sandwich. I don't know if they are cutting cost or not, but cutting back on food is not the way to go. I'll stick to subway."}
{"text":"I have alwS enjoyed there cold sandwiches, but I order a build your own cheese steak, they did not put mushrooms or cheese on and you would need a magnifying glass to find the onions.  When I called to say something the call goes to voicemail.  I could understand a mistake if they were busy, but no other oreads were there when making my sandwich"}
{"text":"Love it! All sandwiches are $5.25 and toasted! (they have one supreme one that is like 4 or 5 meats that cost a $1 more) SCORE! Cute little kids menu, for $3.75? or so. I was amazed with every bite. Had the grinder from the Italian category. So so sooooo good! Grab the bag with the category you want at the top, pick your bread, toppings, condiments, and write you name at the bottom, give to the cashier, and wait for you name to be called. DIG IN! So seem less and easy. The bread was so perfectly crunch and soft at the same time. The only thing I could complain about was when you eat your sandwich the fillings are one bite and the meat is your next. This normally makes me annoyed but with this place I did not care, I had to consciously eat slowly so I wasn't done in 5 minutes. What a good reason for me to head to Westgate and see a movie, even if I've passed several theaters on the way. I can not wait to try something else. 

What I had: 
wheat bread grinder (salami, capicola, and pepperoni), with pepper jack, dijon mustard, FAT FREE Mayo (what who has this, MAJOR Plus for me), red onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles, cucumbers, bell peppers (they were red), black olives, vinegar, oregano, parmesan, and garlic. Wow, that's a lot, but it was my first time, I had to put it to the test, plus i'm weird and love my sammies stacked. 

The end."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a ton of time so decided to stop and try it out. The food was okay. My problem with this restaurant is that the ordering process is complicated and no one was really willing to explain it. Once I finally did order I sat down and watched my food being made. To my horror I watched one of the sandwich makers fix her hair while wearing gloves, and then make a sandwich, and the other did some cleaning and stocking of shelves, and then make a sandwich, both without changing gloves. No matter how good the food might have been (which, in this case not very) I would never eat there again. If this is the standard they have in the front of the house I can only imagine what they do out of site."}
{"text":"Oohhhh yea!! This place is delish!!

I LOVE deli sandwiches! This place is so far one of THE BEST! Why you ask?? They have capicola! AHHHH!!! CHERUBSSSS!! I came here with my son and was happy they have reasonably priced sandwiches! I got the deets on how to use the ordering system (brown paper bag) and got to work. 

I love all the choices they have! All the meats and cheeses and toppings, just awesome! Whats really the best is the customer service! They are soooo sweet and caring! They answered my million questions I had and didnt even looked pissed whilst I was asking : ) 

I got my all time fave: capicola, ham, and swiss! My son got a plain ham sandwich. We got our chips and sat down. He got the reg salt and vinegar and I tried the house chips, which I assume they make : ) lol. Yummm! They had cracked black pepper and were pretty delish! I heard our names and got up to get our goodies!

I sat down and about tore open the bag, I bit into my sandwich and almost crapped myself! Sooooo savory and scrumptious! My son and I sat in silence for almost 2 mins while we devoured our yummies! The sandwiches were PERFECT! The bread was also amazing!

The only gripe I have is how freezing it is! I was almost shivering! But thats ok, my sandwich made up for it! Go there now and have a nice lil dinner of yummieness!"}
{"text":"Gosh, these subs are killer delicious! I can't get enough of their goodness. I always get the Italian BMT. I had went for lunch and it was very packed! However, the service was quick and nice. Which which is a must whether it's lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I heard they were never able to uncover the pervert employee who put a camera in the women's bathroom. Only eat here if you wanna have someone watch you in the restroom. All creepy anyway"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER ONLINE Sandwich was good, but I ordered online and picked up 5minutes after they said to... And they still hadn't even started... \"We got busy\" meanwhile the dining room is completely empty, and there are two workers."}
{"text":"This is a solid little sub shop in Westgate Center. The ordering process is a little different from most places. Instead of walking up to counter and telling an employee what you want, you grab a brown bag off the wall and mark what you want with a Sharpe. It seems a little odd at first, but this actually helps speed up the process (which takes a little bit of time since all of the subs are toasted). 

Like any sub shop, there's a huge selection of meats and toppings, and you can stuff any sandwich with nearly anything you can think of. The price is also pretty good at less than 6 bucks. However, the basic sub is not enough to satisfy a normal appetite for more than an hour or two. Your best bet is to either get a side of chips, or go for extra meat (dollar upcharge), or double meat (2 dollar upcharge). That's really my only gripe with Which Which. I would give it four stars, but once you start paying for the extras, you're getting close to gourmet sandwich prices, for subs that are significantly smaller than Quizno's or Jimmy John's.  If you're looking for something sweet, I highly recommend a shake or malt.  It's way better at Which Which than at most burger places!

One thing to note, the employees here are always really friendly and cool. They deserve five stars. I've stopped by here a few times over the past couple of years, and never had a bad experience with any of them. They always seem to be having a good time behind the counter.

If you're heading to an event at the arena or stadium, this a great spot to grab a bite before heading in to save some cash on concessions.  But Which Which certainly isn't a place that I would hop into my car and drive out of my way to."}
{"text":"I've been to this location so many times, but way before my yelp days. I am not a huge sub sandwich fan really, but I LOVE the subs at which which. The bread is always fresh and soft. I hate going into s place and the bread is so hard and feels like it's been left out all night. I like the fact that you can come in and pick up a bag depending on the type of sand which you would like, pick your toppings, and place your name on the bag. It makes it easy for you and the employees. No matter how busy they are my food always get to me quickly. Today was no different. This location is my favorite out of all the stores . It's always clean, employees are great  and very easy to communicate with.  They have restrooms that are always clean and attended to. Another great thing is after you're done you can walk around West Gate and check out other shops or watch a movie at AMC........annnnnnnd the new Dutch Bros is open in the same shopping center for coffee after! I forgot to take a pic of my sandwich sorry guys lol. When you're hungry your hungry."}
{"text":"Was excited to come back but this time was not to happy with the sandwich choice. I got the mufletta. It was bland and not tasty at all. Olive spread was gross. The ham was salty and to over powering. Pulled that out and that went to waste. So I will never order that sandwich ever again. The home chips that they serve have no flavor. That's ok because my big chip bag contained about 5 and a half chips. Never again... service was ok just seemed like the staff was in their own little world. Tables were dirty too. I like which wich   but I was just not feeling it at this location."}
{"text":"This is a pretty quality sandwich!
I have eaten here 5 or so times and never been disappointed!
I have had the BLT, one of my favorites.. I love the chopped up bacon!
The tuna was good and the chicken too.
Their bread is really fresh. 
All around, just a really good sandwich!!"}
{"text":"You have got to try this place!  I love the concept of writing what you want on the bag your sandwich comes in.  It speeds up the line since there never is one because the slow pokes are still figuring things out on the sidelines and you can bolt right by them if you know what you are doing.  The ingredients are always good and fresh, plus the way they grill the sandwich it always comes out so perfectly blended and tasty.  Cant say enough about this place except they need more locations, I have to make a special visit if I am craving this place or plan my day around it when i get close by."}
{"text":"I wouldn't give any stars if I could. This has the worst customer service. No greeting. No eye contact. Then when I went to order I didn't know I was supposed to fill out some stupid paper brown bag for my order.  I wanted one sandwich. And then they let 2 customers ahead of me while I went to fill out a bag for 1 paper bag. They looked high and dirty and were extremely slow. Needless to say I walked out and didn't get a chance to try it. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Loved this place when they opened but this time I was disappointed.   Tea had a bad flavor, tables were dirty, son said meatballs tasted funny and no sauce and my turkey coleslaw was bland.   Bread didn't seem like anything special.  Too expensive for below average food."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are ok but there are so many better choices in town. The only reason why I compromise on the substandard sandwich is because the OREO shake is the bomb. BUT the last 2 visits the ice cream machine has been broken. Get it together!! It's been weeks!! I'll bar calling ahead from now on. You have lost my business until the shakes are back."}
{"text":"First time visiting this establishment. I had some initial confusion withe ordering process. Once figured out it is quite easy. Take bag of the protein you want, put name on bag, select ingredients, give to cashier. Ordered the \"Wicked\" wich which they say is the signature sandwich. It has Roast beef, Turkey, Bacon, pepperoni, and ham. You select three cheeses (went with american, swiss, mozzarella) with yellow mustard. Had them toast it and it was delicious. The proteins and cheese muddle together as tends to happen when you have too much of a good thing. All in all a fine experience."}
{"text":"EHRRMEGHERRD WHICHWICH! I love whichwich, by far my favorite sandwich shop, spicy mayo and horseradish mustard on my sandwich?! yes please!!"}
{"text":"I was surely a dissatisfied customer when I left the first time.  The store manager, Allison, was kind enough to invite us back.  The service was much better!  Still freezing, so bring a long sleeve shirt or sweater with you!  Shrimp Po Boy is yummy!  We will try it again and if the service stays more in line with our last visit, we could make it a regular thing."}
{"text":"When I first walked in here, I was slightly confused by the ordering process. It isn't like Jimmy John's (my favorite sandwich place ever!) where you order something and then customize it. You order by checking off little boxes on the bags they have provided for you, which is actually pretty cool. 

I got a turkey beast, as that's my favorite sandwich meat. I decided to be healthier, so I loaded it with veggies and no mayo. The meat was good, the veggies were good, and the bread was good. So, it was a good sandwich, right? Right! It was good, and I was happy with it from start to finish. 

The sandwich didn't take too long to arrive, but that may have been because there were only like 2 people there. Regardless, I felt that the service was good, and definitely not something I can complain about. Plus, everyone working there just seemed nice. It was a step above what I was expecting. 

Price-wise, this place seemed more expensive than I expected. Not anything that set me back big time, but enough that I thought \"maybe I'll stick to the Subways and JJ's.\" Again, this place is good, but the pricing is a bit more premium than I'd like to pay."}
{"text":"*** I\"m not a local... ***

I was walking around looking for a place to grab dinner. Oh, I'm here in Phoenix in the middle of the week and there's hardly anyone here where I am. But the waitor said that it generally gets busy during the weekend. Anyhow, I was trying to find something healthy to eat. Choices were sushi, Johnny Rocket, Cold Stone, and some other places. Which Wich kind of looked interesting and I thought it would be healthier since it won't be deep fried.

The cashier was really cool. I told her that I wasn't from the area and asked for suggestions. She told me about the \"Wicked\" but I told her that it had too much meat. Her second fav was #7 which was the Grinder.

I asked her how Which Wich is different from Subway. She said that subway toasted their bread and Which Wich toasted it half way and after preparing the sandwich, they toast it. I guess you can say it's a combo of Subway and Quizno's.

Anyhow, the sandwich was... ok. it wasn't like a WOW, if I ever visit Phoenix I must come back. It was just ok. The environment was pretty nice although it was pretty much vacant. The whole shopping area was pretty much vacant. Anyhow, the service was pretty good. The cashier was very kind and helpful. The cost of my sandwich, bag of chips, and a drink cost about $8.50. Oh, another plus, per the cashier, you can bring Which Wich sandwiches into the AMC theatre.

Btw, Which Wich has their own potato chips. I tried one, but didn't care too much for it.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this shop is that it is 30 minute drive from my house. I I love you the bread they make. I would be here much more often if there was one on my side of town."}
{"text":"Next to Earl of sandwich which there are no locations in Phoenix, this is hands-down the best sub place in the Valley. The portions are perfect and a lot of unique items such as candied walnuts and onion straws. I ordered a Cuban sandwich and it was very tasty. The price is a little more than your average sub shop but it isn't Subway quality, so you pay for what you get... Quality."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Both times, sandwich was excellent.  Both times, place was empty, yet service was too slow. If you are even slightly in a hurry, don't go here. Food is good though. Employees strike me as a little creepy, but hey it's Vegas."}
{"text":"Anytime I am in the Glendale area I love stopping in.  I have only ordered one kind of  sandwhich from this place, and will always order it. They are very good and I love the fact that you can get your sandwich any way you want it.  Will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Being generous because the bread was good. Since you order everything individually it comes out individually. A customer with his daughter orders a cookie, a kids grilled cheese and I think its called the wicked, same sandwich I ordered. The cookie came out. A couple minutes later the grilled cheese came out and them maybe 8 min later his sandwich came out. Not the most efficient way of doing it. Also, the sandwiches are toasted which is not my preference, and if it posted that they do that I must have missed it. I might give them another try sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I used to come here quite a bit when I lived in the area.  Staying nearby, we decided to check it out again for lunch.  Still tastes good!  It's a new spin to an overall boring concept (like Subways).  You get a bag, select from a ton of different sandwiches, and then mark what you want on it and then give them the bag and wait for it to be made fresh.  I used to eat so much Subway that I overall gave up on sandwiches because they bored me but Which Wich is a great alternative.  I had the Beef Cheesesteak yesterday with Cheez Whiz, crispy onion strings, caramelized onions and black olives on it.  It was so filling I swore I'd only eat half of the medium (10\") but moments later I was devouring the other half and already knowing I was going to hate myself later.  But, it was worth it.  Definitely worth checking it out if you are wanting a change from the generic boring sub-type places."}
{"text":"Good Samich, I got the Italian sub. If this company really wants knock it out of the park, they will drop the hot pepper spread which contains chopped celery, and carrots, i dont think that spread had any pepperz in it. They should offer a real pepper spread like you find in Samich shops on the east coast. It's a crushed cherry pepper spread, this will dial these samiches into another dimension."}
{"text":"as I always do, I had a craving for sandwiches and decided to try a new place to order sandwiches from in the area. When I walked in I noticed that the place was a little bit busy and were only two guys working in the store, they handed me and my friend bags with sharpies and didn't further explain how we were supposed to order how the process worked or anything. After reading all of the different bags and trying to figure out which one was different from the rest we noticed on top of all of the bags were the names of their signature sandwiches. We ordered a shrimp sandwich & the five meat sandwich which took them 25 minutes to make, which wouldn't have been a big deal if they greeted us, explained the menu, and weren't rude local high school boys who looked like they didn't want to be there. The shrimp sandwich was not only soggy it wasn't all the way cooked, the bread and sauce seemed watery, the shrimp tasted like fish sticks. The 3 meat sandwich looked like it could have some potential from the presentation of it but the overall sandwich was bland. No wow-factor at all, non-informative employees, if you want a good sandwich I suggest the deli department in Smith's over this joint."}
{"text":"After seeing how quick our sandwiches came out and trying to decide exactly what to order from the endless options of ingredients, and finally taking my first bite of the toasted pesto chicken sandwich....I just knew. 

Good bye Subxxx. Hello Which Wich. So delicious! A quick lunch sandwich filled to the ends of the bread bun. And neatly cut in half in case you want to save the other half for later. I picked white bread, chicken pesto, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushroom, and candied walnuts. And then a side of BBQ kettle chips for more crunchiness. 

What a great sandwich experience enjoyed out in the patio chairs nearby!"}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time with about 15 co-workers.  I'm sure they were not expecting that many people on a random Tuesday during the lunch hour, but that is no excuse for unorganized, slow service.  

So, the idea here is you fill out a form to place your order (and put your name on it), and it becomes the paper bag that holds your completed sandwich.  They put the order up on a wire and push it on down the line as they put it together.  Simple system that keeps the orders in order and you pick up your sandwich when they call you name.  Yet, my very simple turkey sandwich wasn't ready until after 5 other people's sandwiches who ordered after me.  How do you screw that up?  Another of my co-workers had the same thing happen with his order.  And their sandwiches were just as basic as mine and his.

Then, as I said, I ordered a turkey sandwich, however, I truly had to take apart my sandwich to see if there was any turkey on it.  There was, but it was so minimal, I might as well have ordered the vegetarian option.  

My new job is within walking distance of this Which Wich, and I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"Our first time here. We will be back.   Order their shakes! I recommend the surf and turf."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good sandwich place and finally found it. We shared an Italian and it was soooo good. Sure you have to build your own, but the fresh bread and ingredients make up for that. We will definitely be back to try some of the others."}
{"text":"Excellent new addition to the NW Vegas eateries. Which Wich has a staggering selection of sandwiches and ingredient combinations. I had the Bac-Hammon with Spicy Mayo, Caramelized Onions, Avocado, Swiss, and Pepper Jack on wheat. Flavors were great, food was fresh, and the bread was good quality. The house kettle chips are ok, but the smoothies and cookies are legit. It's also only $5.25 for any sandwich with whatever toppings and sauces you want! (Other than add ons like avocado or double meat) I can't wait to go back and try out the Cuban and a friend of mine had the MonteCristo and said it was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Shrimp Po boy was fab but too small for $9! They have Mr. PIBB & MELLO Yellow.  Still craving shrimp. I shall return."}
{"text":"This place is not as complicated as everyone is making it seem!!! Super easy. You basically have 10 different types of menus that could be made into a sandwich, lettuce wrap or a salad bowl... 
The workers were helpful and friendly. 
Thankfully I came here despite these reviews about it being too complicated and chaotic!
Definitely a must try! I also love it that they have a nice variety for vegetarians, like myself :) 
Don't let the other reviews fool you!"}
{"text":"Its a different kind of sandwich shop. You order your sandwich from a paper bag by chinking the items you like."}
{"text":"First time eating here and this place beats Subway and Port of Subs. As a matter of fact they don't belong in the same category. I got the Italian sub and the bread was fresh and everything in between was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good food, and unique take at a sandwich shop. French dip I got was great! Great staff too, at least when I went. 2 younger guys."}
{"text":"Which which is bomb! Definitely suggest this place to anyone! Come in,choose which sandwich you'd like by selecting the coinciding bag. On the bag has your options (cheese,topping,condiments,etc),mark them off and hand it to the line and you're set. Got the pesto chicken with feta and pesto sauce, deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I like the fact that you can literally create almost any kind of sandwich here. It is almost like a glorified subway of sorts. I don't eat meat, so it was nice to have a few options. Not super delicious where it makes me wanting to go back. Just a place to go if I'm in the area and don't feel like anything else but a sub."}
{"text":"I love which wich! There are so many options and unique toppings. It's like a customizable and upgraded subway. They have a lot of healthy options as well, including customizable salads. Make sure you have stamp card, so you can get a free sandwich because you'll want to come back."}
{"text":"It was about 45 minutes til closing so I walked in and quickly filled out my order. I ended up getting a small cheesesteak and some treats. I had attempted to order a milkshake but they couldn't do it because they just put out the ice cream and it was too hard...? Ok, so I grabbed a rice crispy and couldn't resist grabbing a brownie too. The cheesesteak was terrible. I ended up tossing the other half. I found the meat to be really unappealing. It looked like ham, except darker. They only thing I've enjoyed here so far is the black bean patty. You can find it under the vegetarian options...it's good even for hardcore meat eaters!"}
{"text":"Have absolutely great subs, but are on the expensive side . I would have rated them higher, but they do not service the place well.  Was dirty; food crumbs all over several tables; food from previous meals on floor; had no large cups for drinks ( all out); all out of napkins. So, bring your own napkins & cups  as subs can be messy. And maybe a broom to clean the floor ; cleaning your own table is a must!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  The ordering is different, you pick a sandwich meat type, grab a bag which has the choices of stuff you want on sandwich, mark what you want. Take bag to counter, pay & in a few minutes your made sandwich the way you wanted it comes up. Very tasty, will try them again."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, nice fresh bread and ingredients. This place reminds me of the Potbelly Sandwich chain back home."}
{"text":"For a sandwich shop, this is pretty darn good!  Better than Subway!  Great concept with the paper bag ordering system.  Sandwiches came out just the way we wanted them!  And, don't forgot to get a cookie - comes out fresh & hot!"}
{"text":"Sure does live up to the name \"superior sandwiches\" I love this place so much. My favorite sandwich place on the face of the universe! I love how you just fill out what you want inside of standing and rehearsing your order in your head, you just fill it out in a brown paper bag. I also love how versatile they are, you don't have to get a sandwich you can get a salad or you can get it in a bowl or a wrap! I always get the same thing. Black bean patty, cheddar, ranch, black olives, red onion, pickles, tomato, lettuce. And I love getting the house chips! I'm just bummed that this is the only location but it's worth the commute!!"}
{"text":"Which Wich has to be my favorite sub/sandwich place on the planet. So far I have yet to find another venue that meets the quality and efficiency of this particular establishment. I'm not originally from Arizona, or the southwest in general, and have never heard of such a location before, so to try this for my first time? Oh man is it good. 

Every time I visit Phoenix, I have to make a stop here. NO EXCEPTIONS. Ha-ha. It's incredibly easy to order as well! You just grab a bag from their various assortments of bags (I picked the large Ham), and just circle or mark which toppings you want! It's that easy! You can have cheese and any type of cheese mind you, Hot or cold subs, avocados, lettuce, cabbage, your choice of mustard, and dressings. You tell them EXACTLY how you would like it. 

And if you use the YELP CHECK-IN option on your smartphone, you get a FREE COOKIE. Now c'mon, a free cookie with an already delicious meal? Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Better than Subway and Quizno's in my opinion. A little on the small side for me though."}
{"text":"Only 2 girls working the night I came in. They seemed swamped with 3 other orders. I ordered their Muffaletta. I've had their Muffaletta before and love the olive spread so I ordered it with 2x's the amount. It came out about 10 minutes later with an apology for the wait but it was fresh and tasty as always. I had it toasted which makes the bread even more delectable. 

Vanilla malts are nice here as well as their kids menu where you can request a sandwich without crust. For a fast food choice Which Wich is a bright spot on variety and taste."}
{"text":"We stopped lunch after a doctor's appointment and I'm so glad we did! The sandwich was great and I loved the atmosphere.its definitely better than the similar type sandwich shops in the area like subway or port of subs. I love their ordering system too. It makes things way faster than the other shops! I got the wheat roll and it was so good! Being from the east coast it was closer to what you find out there than what you usually find out here. Prices were more than reasonable and all the workers were super friendly and helpful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had never been here before as I live in California and we do not have this establishment.  I loved it! I got the chicken cordon bleu, you basically create your own sandwich similar to subway but Better! There's lots of choices and add ons and you choose everything down too the sauces and fixings.  I had pesto, spicy ranch,  lettuce,  tomato, and bellpeppers on my chicken cordon bleu and it was soooooo yummy. I will definitely be craving this when I'm gone.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"First time in.... Wow! Really good. I got a skinny veggie and I loved it. 
The employees made me feel welcome. Pretty nice to walk in and not feel like you are bothering them.     YUMMY!"}
{"text":"If it's Monday, you'll probably find me at Which Wich! We are officially addicted to double punch Mondays so we can expedite the free sandwich achievement. (Hey, it's the little things in life sometimes.) Since we've been coming for a while, I have perfected my order (almost). I order the Tomato & Avocado and skinny my 'wich for less bread. I order virtually every topping they offer, including their killer hot peppers.  The only slight disappointment is I am pretty sure they used to have hummus as a spread option, but it seems to have disappeared. If you check in on Yelp, you get a premium topping for free, so wait, maybe I could ask for hummus!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, and they always surprise me with something new and tasty!
I meander through their menu (over 30 sandwiches!) and come across something different. They have unique breads that they're more than happy to describe. 
Beyond the standards, they can make it the way you want it. Friendly service, good food.. What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"I LOVE to go to this place!  I go there about 3 times a week (sometimes). Their sandwiches taste so fresh and if you want healthy you will get that and if you just want a fun sandwich you can get that too. I personally love the Turkey sandwich because it's also fresh meat!  I also like how you have a lot of options in front of you and sometimes at other places the cashier could have trouble understanding what you say but you don't need to hear to read a paper so this is a pretty clever idea. I definitely would recommend this place because it's very kid friendly with the crayons and the kid-sized sandwich!  Hope you can check this place out!!!  Lily H.-11yrs"}
{"text":"Love the idea and being able to build your own sandwich. I had the pulled pork and my girlfriend built her own. She loves it because she always wants a million things on her sandwich. Very friendly attentive staff sandwiches came out quick will be back"}
{"text":"Why is everyone else writing their reviews on this listing on Hanna?? Wrong address peeps!
The actual address is:
9404 W Westgate Blvd # C102
Glendale, AZ 85305-3151
(623) 977-9424

So I had been wanting to eat here for a while, but everytime I come to Westgate it was to meet friends at one of the big restaurants there.
So I came here today on my own for lunch. It was pretty easy to figure out how to order (you pick a bag by number that corresponds to the category number on the menu then you choose your toppings)
I got the Ruben with provolone and thousand island and I substituted the sauerkraut for  coleslaw and it came toasted. I also ordered the house chips which are homemade potato chips with salt and pepper.
So I got my sandwich and was surprised at how small it was. It was significantly smaller than the sandwich places I normally go to. So I ignored the size and dove in. WOW! The bread was so good. Toasted without being dry, light. The meat was perfectly cooked, not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place, the coleslaw was so good and flavorful, juicy without dripping all over the place. The chips were also really good! Now the sandwich was smaller than I am used to but it wound up being the perfect size. It was so good I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good, solid sandwiches. They have a good assortment of sandwiches and they are all, by the very nature of their set-up/gimmick, extremely customizable. You grab the appropriate bag (chicken, turkey, etc), mark what toppings you want on your sandwich and hand it to the cashier. The first time you walk in, that unusual system can be a little confusing, but on our first visit, the cashier came out from behind the counter and happily explained it to us. I actually dig this system because, after you know what you're doing, it cuts down on mistakes. And then, when/if it does happen, it's most likely your own fault, so you have no one else to blame. Like I said, good sandwiches, friendly staff, fresh and efficient system, but nothing mind-blowing. When I'm in the area, like before catching a movie at the AMC, I'll definitely be stopping in again, but beyond that, I probably wouldn't make a trip solely to eat here."}
{"text":"Great selection and impersonation of an IRS tax form with their little selection menu.   Which works;  the scribble-down note part beats having to sit and wait for a guy to decide if he wants olives or not on his sandwich he's already laden down with 16 other condiments.   Reasonably fast turnaround, seems like a good price."}
{"text":"I like the bags that you make your selections on. I picked the Italian bag and checked off Meatball, Small, White, Hot Wich, Provolone & Parmesan, Marinara, Oregano. The guy rang us up more quickly than past visits. Got a few punches on my punch card. My sub came out piping hot! The marinara is not very \"saucy\" and mostly tomato chunks. The meatballs were pretty good and the bread is soft. This is not a cheap sandwich place. And I don't like their chairs- hard pieces of wood on wobbly metal legs."}
{"text":"What does one get with a Caprese sandwich? I really didn't have a clue so I went with the recommendations of the staff. What I really wanted to order was a Black Bean Patty, but Which Wich happened to be out of stock on this visit. :(

First off, reading Which Wich's reviews on Yelp was sure helpful in deciphering the unusual ordering process. Thanks fellow Yelpers! I was fully prepared to grab a bag and pen and start filling out bubbles for what I wanted on my 'wich.  

Employees were friendly and helpful for us first-timers. The sandwich shop was clean and had plenty of seating. Wait time was probably under 7 minutes. 

CAPRESE SANDWICH: I have to say that I like Subway better. Both me and my husband were unimpressed with the tastes of our respective sandwiches. I only ate half of my sandwich, and not for a lack of appetite. 

PRICE: The total for 2 medium subs and 2 drinks came to about $21. After a restaurant.com certificate, the total was around $13. 

Worth a return visit?
Which Wich's high-ish prices for a sandwich shop (Capriotti's is cheaper) and the location make it unlikely we'll return.

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #39"}
{"text":"This place is a step up from Subway and Port of Subs. I walked in and did not know what to do. I'm so tired of businesses making me do their job...like I work there. First, it was the grocery stores with the self-check out lanes, now Which Wich. They should at least give you an apron or a hair net, so I can feel like you're a part of the team.

So, you walk in and you have to grab your own bag with a number that corresponds to the sandwich you want. You have to basically take your own order, even though they have three perfectly capable people who should provide this service to me. I messed up on taking my own order a few times, probably because I NEVER take my own order. That's what I typically pay for, someone else taking down my order. Nope, not here and they did not compensate me for my time either.

I ordered a turkey sandwich and an artichoke and cheese sandwich with hummus. Their turkey meat is really tasty, but not worth all the work.

Their cookies are outstanding, and you are not required to write up your own order.

Who in the world thought this was a novel idea?"}
{"text":"I wish we had one in Vacaville, CA. It's better then subway and it a simpler then most sub shops as far as what to order. 
My first time going to this place was last week. Whenever I come to visit I always pass this place up and wondered if was any good. I finally had my first which wich, and the girl who helped me made my gyro sandwich so good that I suggested to my husband that we go there to eat today. This time it was another employee that made my sandwich and let's talk about over kill with the lettuce and he totally forgot to put the gyro sauce. But on the plus side he made my husband's sandwich look amazing. 

Regardless I wouldn't mind coming back here the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Too bad there's only one in Las Vegas! I would rather eat their sandwiches over Subway and Port of Subs! 

They pretty much have the same sides as other places and more! Their bread is perfect! Since I LOVE ICE... they have crushed ice here! The customer service here is great also!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Tons of options. Thank You Turkey is my absolute favorite. Punch card where you get a free sandwich after 10 sandwiches (or something like that). The only issue is the service. If it's busy it usually isn't even worth sticking around but even on a slow day it seems like it takes longer than it should. The staff is nice and always apologizes for the wait...but personally I would just rather they figure out  a faster way to make their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Just so so nothing about the place excited me. The prices seemed high for the small amount of meat on the sandwiches. Not sure who is slower which which or firehouse."}
{"text":"This is an fun little sandwich shop.

You enter and there are a variety of different little brown bags you choose from divided up by type of meat (and yes there are vegetarian options). You pick a bag and a pen.

You choose your meats, then your cheeses, then a variety of veggies, sauces, toppings, add ons, and so on and so forth. There are TONS of options.

They can thin your wich (by carving out the excess bread - which I did) to save you calories and carbs.

This was a great little shop. On par with other great sandwhich places (not Subway). Worth checking out, but nothing to drive across town about either."}
{"text":"The Which-Wich in Glendale, AZ is one of my favorite spots. It's a good sandwich. But the mismanagement of this location makes it not worth the stop. First time I was here they had run out of ice (pretty big deal in the desert). Today's visit was marred by: 
-long wait due to understaffing
-watching multiple customers bring sandwiches back due to wrong ingredients
-giving part of my order to someone else

What's the point of personalizing the ordering process (orders and names written on the bag) if you cannot make sandwiches correctly and get them to the right people??

Unlikely to return to this location."}
{"text":"Moved back from central Texas about a year ago and found the ONLY WhichWich in the city. Sadly I live across town and do not get to enjoy it as often as I'd like. 

What led it worse is that this location truly disappointed me today. The staff was so far involved in their own conversations that the level of attentiveness was below standard. 

I've been a rewards member for as long as I can remember, and the girl at the front cashed out my order without even asking if I am or would like to be a rewards member. For the company this is a disgrace. Loyalty programs are organized and put together for people like me, and it damages the company's ability to gain returning customers when not only are they not treated as a person that exists and am contributing to their livelihood by continuing to purchase food items, but as well not engage and reward your loyal customers. 

The restaurant was filthy with several dirty tables and a floor that looks like it had not seen attention for several hours. 

I truly hope my next experience at WhichWich goes smoother because this is how you do not grow in a city that is very centered around hospitality. Someone at the higher end of this franchise needs to wake up and check on their business. 

Extremely unsatisfied!"}
{"text":"Solid sandwich for sure. The only complaint I have is in regards to their bread. It falls apart while you are eating it. Other than that, the sandwich, staff, and options are top notch. 

All the vegetables are fresh. The meats and cheeses comes in a generous amount. I got the chicken pesto sandwich on wheat bread stuffed with a bunch of spinach, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, and feta cheese, but it needed a kick. They didn't put any hot peppers into the sandwich like I asked for, but it was still really good.

The way to order is rather neat. You pick a sandwich bag and mark the items you want to add. For the amount of food you get, the prices are pretty reasonable. I could have easily made my 10 inch sub two meals, but I just kept eating."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place to eat. The restaurant had 3 teenagers cooking/preparing the food. They kept there gloves on for cash transaction and to prepare the food. I order online and they had no cookies available. I switched out for a stale/hard brownie. My order was wrong had groc on the sandwich. Sandwich was nasty and to pricey for the quantity & quality. I will not ever eat and this place again. 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"Sandwich joints generally fall into 3 categories for me:   1) Fast food joints like Port of Subs, Quiznos, Subway which I will only eat in an emergency or if it's free  2) Chains like Jimmy Johns, Jersey Mikes and Heidis which I feel are of a higher quality than those in 1), but not enough where I crave them often, and 3) Capriottis, which is my gold standard because of their not so standard offerings like the Capastrami and generally quality ingredients.

The concept of Which Wich seemed intriguing to me, and I especially loved the variety of options they provide in all areas of sandwich fixings like seafood, cheese whiz, black bean patties, hummus, and more.  Being the MADLY adventurous eater that I am, I threw caution to the wind and got a turkey breast sandwich on wheat with deli mustard, avocado, hot pepper mix and some veggies.  This ish cray.   So yeah, I played it safe.  My thinking was I should try something tame the first time around and if I enjoyed it I could go more adventurous in future visits.

Well WW, prepare a gyro meat sandwich with peanut butter and cheeze whiz because I very much enjoyed all aspects of my sandwich.  All of my ingredients, in particular the thinly sliced turkey breast tasted very fresh and of good quality.  The hot pepper mix provided just the right amount of kick that I needed when combined with the deli mustard and I always appreciate the ability to have spinach on a sandwich instead of lettuce.  

I thought the price was very fair, a bargain actually.  The service was very friendly, and they were all prepared to give us the lowdown on how to order when my coworker and I presented our printouts from their website (pro tip: you can conceive and mark your entire sandwich order online, print it and simply hand it to them if you want to forego the entire potential contagion scare of the shared marker concept)  

My only MINOR gripes were the location is pretty small, and during lunch rush hour it seemed a little tough to maneuver around the mix of customers and employees walking the floor.   Also, I got a combo but they didn't provide any larger bag to place my sandwich and chips in.  Trying to carry the sandwich bag and the chips separately, while certainly not difficult, would have been made a lot easier with a separate bag.   Also, when unwrapping the sandwich, it had gotten quite messy inside the bag and peeling off the paper wrap was impossible without getting my hands covered in avocado and mustard.

When I'm complaining about these sorts of things, you know I'm being nitpicky, but nitpicky is what separates a 4 star experience from a 5 star one.  A challenger to Capriottis throne has emerged."}
{"text":"I'm updating before posting!

So we went again this time for dinner and we got there at 8pm. Workers (2guys) were rushing us and while we were eating were sweeping and putting chairs up (it wasn't even 8:45 yet as they close at 9). Was a total turn off and we were disappointed. I am deducting 2 stars for this because it was still early enough to allow our family to finish our meal without the annoying cleaning going on. Didn't appreciate that at all. After this we agreed that we prob won't be back unless we were in the area and weren't hungry for anything else.....too bad.
Original post:
Yum-O!!! We were soooo satisfied with our sandwiches! We ordered: caprese on wheat (skinny), beef wiz on white and a kids turkey. Total came to $20.....
I added avocado but it was no charge because you get a free \"add in\" with yelp check in. Kids meal only came with a fruit roll up....they should let the child choose a chips or cookie IMO.  Overall I'd say this is the best sandwich place I've tried to date. This beats: firehouse, port a sub and subway for sure! Prices were decent at a regular starting at $5.50.

Have a location in the SW!!!"}
{"text":"When I walked in....I was like \"WTF\". There were bags on the wall and some red sharpie markers on a counter. It took me a minute to figure it out (I'm about a green in the box of crayons...not bright like yellow, but not dark like midnight blue). Any who, the sandwiches all looked great, and I decided on the Club. It was a different kind of club than you would find at say Subway, since it had ham, turkey, and bacon, instead of roast beef. 

On said bag, you mark which ingredients you would like, hand it to the cashier and wait. It wasn't terribly busy, so the wait time was about 5.5 minutes. When I got back to the shop (I was eating with a friend @ her hair salon...great place BTW), I was pleasantly surprised. The bacon wasn't that crap microwave stuff, and it was just delectable. The sub was perfect...not too big, not too small, juuuuusssst right! They do toast it, and I'm not a big fan of toasted subs, but it was about a 2.5 on the toasted scale, and that made me happy! 

I would definitely come here again, as the subs were great, the speed of service was great, EVERYTHING was great!"}
{"text":"This is a good sandwich.

Actually, this is a REALLY good sandwich.

The concept is actually pretty cool: Grab a bag from one of several sandwich types, customize your order to how you want it (from toasted/non-toasted bread, condiments, garnishes, etc), hand it to the cashier, wait a few minutes, and BOOM!  Tasty sandwich.

Actually, the bag idea is really clever.  It ensures that you get what you want (seeing how it's printed right there), and they do offer a lot of sandwich varieties and options within each variety.

I've been here about 3-4 times now, and have yet to have a disappointing sandwich.  Everything tastes fresh and flavorful, and they give you so many options, you can really create a great meal.They even have an \"Elvis Wich\" (peanut butter, bacon, honey, and banana) that looks really tasty and I need to try.  That's listed under \"Comfort Foods\".  Their egg salad and chicken salads are top notch.

They do their own potato chips (solid), and I discovered that they do their own milkshakes last night.

Even the staff is friendly.  Always polite, and make sure that you are enjoying your meal.  The service is fast and thorough.

It all started as a whim, going in here.  But now that I've been a few times, this is a place that I am starting to think about more and more to get my sandwich on.  And I do love a good sandwich.

And they do have a good sandwich.

They have a REALLY good sandwich."}
{"text":"Subway is better. Their sandwich was such lacklustre and the tuna just tasted like it was canned. On top of that the customer service was just rude."}
{"text":"I love Which Wich! The sandwiches are bomb.  However, this location was a let down because they only had one person working. Which meant, he had to take orders and make those same orders. With only 3 people in front of me, it took me nearly 15-20 mins just to get my sandwich which was for takeout. For a quick bite to eat during my lunch break, I don't know if I can come back if it's going to take as long as it did today."}
{"text":"Sooooo I went here last night with a couple friends after coughing for 10 minutes at the soap bubble \"snow\" and the lighting of the tree. I myself don't eat sandwiches very often..... if the fact that most my reviews are Chinese don't give that away lol. So this is a really good sandwich place..... there is 50 different sandwiches to choose from, and you can customize them from there. I got the crab salad with avacado, olives, and spicy mayo. It was pretty much a California roll on bread LOL. and it was really good. So was the oreo shakes. Decent prices, and good food. Gets a 4.5 star but can't do .5 and its more 4 than 5.... but yeah it's good."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast I like real meat in my Sandwich's.....not processed crap. This place was alright if I was on the go and had nothing else around, but honestly when does that ever happen??? I had a turkey sandwich and it was nothing to rave about. Go somehwere with boars head meat."}
{"text":"Poor staff they made so much fuss asking what you want on the wich....if i have to tell them so many times i can go to a subway instead :D"}
{"text":"a Glorified sub shop...ehhhhh... its a unique concept, grab your own bag and mark it with what you want. Not my thing... i want to walk in somewhere look at a menu and tell a person what I want not figure it out, write it down and hand a bag to a sandwich maker. I was not impressed with the sandwich either. Subway is better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Which Wich--just another sandwich shop?  I don't think so.  In a land filled with Subways, Port-a-Subs, and Jimmy Johns', this place sets itself apart by offering its customers the chance to build sandwiches with more toppings than I've ever seen offered at those other joints.  My son beat me to this place before, so when we ventured there for dinner tonight, he mentored me through the ordering process.  Basically you grab a paper sandwich bag that doubles as your order form, choosing the sandwich, your meats, cheeses, sauces, condiments, vegetables toppings, as well as the size of your 'wich.'  I gave up meat for the month of March so I went with a small Caprese:  tomato, mozzarella, and pesto on a toasted wheat roll, adding lettuce as an extra topping.  My teenager, the Devil, ordered a large meatball sandwich- -the nerve!  So, we handed over our orders and after a short wait, our names were called and we went to town on our meals.  It's not very nice to sit across from a kid eating a meatball sub while you sit eating a veggie sandwich, but mine was delicious just the same.  Oh, and when I checked in using my handy Yelp phone app, I got two FREE cookies.  I went back to the counter and showed the young man my phone and he had me fill out another order form for said cookies because they are baked fresh while you wait--kewl.  Needless to say, I will be back next month so I can try the meatball sandwich my own darn self."}
{"text":"This is a excellent sandwich shop. They have such a variety on ingredients and sandwiches on the menu. In a nice area of Westgate and has a nice clean atmosphere. The sandwiches here are delicious. Great job Which Wich."}
{"text":"If I had to base my entire experience on the food itself them id say it was a 10. But the young cashier/sandwich makers that were working today were awful. They CLEARLY hate their job, and one wanted to sweep and the other wanted to do something else while my order was on the wire (Mind you I was the only person in there)and when I said thank you to the young gal for my sandwich, she just looked @ me as if I was speaking a foreign language. A shop is all about the clients experience, an due to this we will not be returning. And it was our fist time every eating here."}
{"text":"I am SO lucky there is not one of these shops in the city I live in. I was first introduced to one in South Carolina on a visit there a few years ago and have dreamed about it since. No joke, dreamed about it. To my pleasant surprise found this one in Vegas and I come to Vegas 2-3 times a year and will make the 20 minute trip from Either the strip or 10 minute trip from Red Rock Casino just to eat these sandwiches. Yes first time is slightly confusing ordering but just ask they'll tell you. Then you'll know for the next 20 times you come. Made exactly to order and bread toasted to perfection like seriously THIS BREAD. Service is just fine, it's a sandwich shop. I get the Italian grinder that includes three meats add black olives tomatoes and avocado and it so delish. With Yelp check in my avocado was free. (One \"add on\" is free including extra meat) fiancé loves this place just as much - his new wich he found on this trip is called the wicked and includes turkey, ham, roast beef, pepperoni, and bacon. The sandwiches come in small medium and large and a small suffices for me even though I'd like to get a large. The sandwiches, while packing a ton of ingredients and taste, are not too big to fit in a mouthful! Again, my waistline and bank account are grateful there's not one close to me I'd be here 2-3 times a week not a year!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich and concept
Been a loyal customer since 2010 at this place
Stopped going to other sandwich places
Italian sandwich is the best
I get to put whatever I want in it
Love the concept"}
{"text":"This review is strictly on the food.  I went to Which Wich yesterday and the ordering process was very unique and fun, but the sandwich I had was nothing to write home about.  I had a meatloaf sandwich under the \"comfort classics\" or \"comfort food\" category and it was gross.  The meatloaf was absolutely devoid of any flavor and just tasted like a flavorless ground beef wad.  I mean, I had cheeses and other spices that should've enhanced the meatloaf, but how can you enhance flavors when they are absent? No salt, no pepper, no ketchup coating, NOTHING! I'm not going to give up on Which Wich just because of this first bad experience, but it failed for me this go around."}
{"text":"The place is different.  You find a bag with your sub choice and fill it out and turn it in.  I had the French dip.  Had great flavor but was pretty small.  Bread was fresh.  Atmosphere was just ok.  It's like sitting in a fast food place."}
{"text":"I like the set up. It's different then most sandwich shops, makes it easier we don't have to wait in line and tell them what to put on it. They had great customer service and the sandwich was good. Ill be coming back to try the others. I'd say overall my girlfriend and I had a good experience !"}
{"text":"Found place on yelp after a day of hiking. Starved. The ordering system is annoying, im not a fan of the bag thing. My sandwich was way overpriced, however, when it came out the medium was larger than i thought. I had to take other half home. I got the wicked with toppings and added free avocado thanks to yelp. Free add on with check in.... You will need it! I ordered a hot wich but it came put cold, none of the cheese was melted like i like. Also, by the time my sandwich came out, my two friends already at most of theirs. Not enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I'm a big Which Wich fan. If you've never eaten at a WhichWich, prepare to be stoked. The scope and variety of ingredients and options is wonderful, not to mention the quality. Quite a bit better than Subway or Port of Subs. I'm bummed this is the only location in Vegas, but if you're in the area, you should definitely go. Plus, because this brand isn't as well known in Nevada as some of the others, you won't fight the lines you get elsewhere. Also, they have several veggie sandwich options that are a major step up than the cheese and cheese available elsewhere. My favorites are the Caprese and Avocado & Tomato (plus you can add almost anything you can think of)."}
{"text":"Check in bonus of a tasty cookie. I'm not above accepting bribes!

This was my first (and hopefully not last) visit. Sandwiches were great. Prices seemed fair. And the system is great for grabbing office lunch. I was skeptical going in. But this place really does seem worth any higher prices compared to other sub shops."}
{"text":"Got three sandwiches and a bowl. Milkshakes are legit chocolate shake out of this world hot cookies and ice cream place is awesome plus I does caring for schools and offices the back way DiLisio so. Great variety. Vegan to meat subs best bread."}
{"text":"Very good food. Great flavors and amazing bread. Very friendly staff too"}
{"text":"The best sandwich I've ever had.  The service was excellent, and staff were top notch. Diego was awesome."}
{"text":"Great location getting in, but getting out turning left is not easy.  Other than that it's in a great convenient location.  
The staff is friendly and helpful when you are deciding which wich to choose.  :) 
Lots of different options.  I like that they have real avocado. YUM! 
When you go in you choose your bag and write your options down on the bag.  Then take it up to the counter and they ring you up.  Nice to be able to write your name on the bag so you hear your name, not just a number.  
Great concept and plenty of options to choose from.  The shakes are yummy, but small.  Good option to make it a meal with chips and a drink, but nothing healthy for a side item like a fruit cup.  
The bread is really soft and easy to bite into as I have an issue with tough/rubbery bread.  
I've been 3 times and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I did not have a great sandwich here but I believe I ordered badly and next time I will try something different. I was there at about 11 a.m. and to me that is when a breakfast sandwich is an option. 
It is a little different from most sandwich stores. You pick out a sandwich bag, a marker and then you fill in dots alongside the ingredients listed on aforesaid bag. It felt like homework.
So I order bacon, egg, feta cheese and wheat bread. I did not oder it toasted. Upon opening the wrapper the sandwich self disrupted. The bacon is bacon bits, NOT rashers. They spilled everywhere, the egg was ok but the cheese was cold { should have toasted it} . Bacon should not be in a jar. Period.
So, a big disappointment but I will go again and order a non bacon sandwich and give the review an update.

PS. Check in on Yelp before your order and you'll get a free add-on."}
{"text":"So the owner asked me to give them another try. Always wanting to give an accurate and complete review I did.

I was assured the markers and counters are cleaned regularly throughout the dayand the mess I saw and felt the first time wasnt there that night. 

The food was still fresh and tasted amazing so Im updating the review saying the mess and chaos from my first trip was likely from a rush and not the norm at this store. Im giving them top marks.

They deserve it!"}
{"text":"How much wich would a which wich wich if a which wich could which wich?

Now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about one of my favorite things: sandwiches. Which wich is a joint that I've visited several times and I have no qualms about. The location is pretty great with it being next to my gym, movie theater and several stores and it's right off the freeway. 
The sandwiches are well made with a nice courteous staff with no complaints. The prices are fair, there's never too much of a crazy wait. In terms of sandwich hierarchy I'd put it above subway, port of subs and jersey mikes  but below Capriottis, firehouse subs and Jason's deli
Overall, they're a good sandwich place that doesn't disappoint, but they're more of a \"if you're in the area\" and less of a \"I'm going to make a drive\" type of sandwich place"}
{"text":"Always great service and great sandwiches.  Great location at Westgate, right by the parking lot.  This is my go to place when I venture to Westgate."}
