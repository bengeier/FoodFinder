{"text":"My wife and I have heard about this place for a couple months, and finally got a chance to try it this week.  It has lived up to the hype!  The drinks were excellent (burnt orange manhattan, Warhol, and honey bourbon all were amazing), the staff was extremely friendly, food was delicious, and view was spectacular.  I had the Salmon, and would definitely get it again.  We had the charcuterie for an app, and it was a wonderful selection.  In addition to our order, we were given free seasoned popcorn, a puff pastry, and a treat to take home at the end of the meal.    My wife and I highly recommend Altius, definitely worth a trip when you're in town!"}
{"text":"I went for the second time last night & took some friends from out of town. The food was delicious, the view was amazing, & the staff was so accommodating when my reservation at vue 412 went terribly wrong. A fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"Great view and food! Generally speaking, Mt. Washington has such an outdated feel, so Altius is a refreshing change with its elegant look and modern menu. As a huge fan of Bistro 19, I was excited to try B and Chef Jessica's new venture, and they did not disappoint. Although it's expensive, the food was great quality. Since I love the pork tenderloin at Bistro 19, I tried the Pork Chop. It was a very generous portion and was absolutely delicious. The dessert was the star. We shared the pear cake and chocolate espresso cheesecake, and both were fabulous. Would definitely go back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Vegan eggplant rollatini was amazing!!! Pork chop amazing!! Filet amazing!!! Dessert amazing!! View .. AMAZING"}
{"text":"This place knocks it out of the park. It was actually recommended to us by our über driver. First, the view from the dining room is absolutely amazing!  And then comes the food & the service. Both were outstanding. Unfortunately our entrees were both overcooked. So they remade them & nailed both. My wife had the rack of lamb & I had the salmon. You must give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Obviously, this restaurant has a fantastic view of the city. In addition, the service was impeccable, especially our waitress, Heather. I loved how attentive they were to offering warm, fresh bread or refilling our drinks. The she-crab soup was the best I've had.  All of the appetizers, entrees, and desserts were outstanding. The highlights were the sea bass, ravioli, tartare, and peanut butter bar for dessert. Well done!"}
{"text":"Altius provides excellent food and an outstanding view. The atmosphere is business casual, so no need to dress to the nines.  The menu has something for everyone, from seafood to vegetarian dishes. However, if you are lactose intolerant like myself, it is very difficult to indulge in all courses, especially dessert.   The most impressive aspect of the food is the mixture of textures. I ordered scallops for my first course, which were soft and flaky, and this was complimented by some crunchy vegetables slices. My main dish was salmon, coated with everything bagel crust. Again, the flaky salmon and the crunchy outer crust was fantastic.   Other members of my party claimed that the deserts were delicious, but I only drank coffee. It was surprisingly bold and a fantastic alternative to dessert. The pastry chef sent guests home with a pastry sample that was divine with my coffee the next morning.  It is possible to be seated at a table with no view, so if that's important to you, make sure that you request it.   Overall, excellent service, food is worth the price, and the view is very romantic."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and an amazing view.  It may take awhile to get a table next to the window but is very well worth it. Would recommend and would come back to visit."}
{"text":"service a+ view a+ chicory salad a+ charcuterie a+ crab toast a+ scallops a halibut special - no taste - d  would I go back ... YES as often as to Monterrey Bay ... NO why ... very limited menu especially the desserts"}
{"text":"Great cocktails, outstanding food, incredible views.  Very much look forward to dining here again soon."}
{"text":"Took my wife to Altius for her birthday dinner and we were both quite impressed with this eatery.  Everything you hope for in a fine dining experience was covered here, in spades.  Decor?  Modern and elegant.  Ambiance? Unbeatable skyline view.  Food?  Nothing short of spectacular.  Service?  Felt like we were being waited on by 10 people.    We look forward to our next opportunity to dine at Altius, because our first experience there was wonderful!"}
{"text":"We definitely enjoyed the view from our window table at Altius. After hearing glowing reviews we thought it would be perfect for celebrating our anniversary with several friends. We did enjoy the food we ordered which included the sea bass, the pork chop ,the gnocchi and a special of the day Halibut. All were well prepared although I thought the portion of the sea bass and halibut were rather small. Now for the surprise. We mentioned the anniversary when making the reservation also mentioned it to the hostess that day and it our waiter. We thought perhaps a greeting on a dessert we ordered or at least an acknowledgement would have been nice. Also I guess we happened to get the worst waiter of the staff. He seemed rushed as soon as he came to the table. Seemed slightly annoyed when we asked about certain dishes. Oh well I guess it was the luck of the draw. What should have been a fine dining experience was lacking not in the cuisine but definitely in the service"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and mouth watering food. Absolutely wonderful service with a beautiful view. A Pittsburgh must."}
{"text":"I took my mother here for her 80th birthday- the staff could not have been nicer or more attentive and they made my mother feel very special. Stunning location (one of the best views on this PLANET) and the food was innovative and delicious and the service stellar.  One of our best nights ever - THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal her on Saturday. Shared the butter poached lobster, the salmon, and the steak. Delicious food an incredible view of the city. Our server was extremely nice and accommodating of food allergies."}
{"text":"Wonderful evening with wonderful vegetarian food. Loved the cheese, Aligot potatoes and Black Forest cake. Must visit in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Awesome view, food, and service! I've been here only once so far, but I am definitely planning on visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Outstanding view. Impeccable service. And DELICIOUS food. We were treated by a small one bite app from the chef along w a bite size dessert. Such a nice surprise. And the truffle popcorn wqw scrumptious. I would highly recommend for date night any special occasion or out of town guests! We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I are visiting Pittsburg and we took my train loving son to ride the trolly. We ate dinner first so my five year old had to go to the bathroom when we got to the top there wasn't one in the station. We looked everywhere but couldn't find one. We stopped I to altius and I wanted to ask if I could buy a drink so my son could use the bathroom. Before I could say a word the very rude and stuck up hostess judged me and said \"we don't have public restrooms\" wow you should be ashamed of yourselves! I mean I could see for an adult but the five year old was clearly could not hold it much longer and it was an emergency. I mean come on! As I left the hostess said \"aw he's holding himself\" and laughed!!!"}
{"text":"Fanfreakingtastic!  The view of the city, appetizers, dinner and dessert were GREAT!  Service was good and the overall experience was just the perfect cap to my long weekend in the Burgh."}
{"text":"While the food was well presented and most meals very flavorful, there are things we noticed: -Candle: the inside of the holder was dirty which shows you just add a new candle without cleaning the wax/dust on the inside. -Sugar with coffee: the sugar serving spoon was dirty, the coffee wasn't an espresso. -Server: announced specials too fast, presented your meals too fast so you couldn't understand what she was saying. -The dimming of the lights every so often doesn't create ambiance. In terms of our meals: Most of the items we ordered were fine however the lobster ravioli was odd. We all tasted the mushrooms and discovered: they had zero taste. The dough was thick for the pasta and the filling (lobster) was bland. While we know that lobster should shine on its own, it was lacking flavor to the point that the meal wasn't finished.  Very good cod, great portion. Watermelon salad was well presented, tasty. Calamari was inventive, very nice.  The burrata was very creamy but was was overpowered by the amaretto biscuit. The sorbet was creamy and fresh tasting.  Ruinart Blanc de Blancs was perfect. For price vs expectations: I won't be running back next week."}
{"text":"Went on 6/27 for our anniversary. The place has a GREAT view - one of the best in Pittsburgh. Very clean, upscale restaurant. The food was impeccable. My husband got the lamb chops and I got the pork - both cooked perfectly! The sides are equally as delicious - he had garlic rice pilaf with the lamb and my pork chops came with amazing skinned/ mashed potatoes.   We could tell they were still working through the newness of the restaurant..... there was almost too many people working. That said - the service was outstanding and everyone was so nice. I would highly recommend this place. It's a little more expensive but worth the few extra dollars. Very nice atmosphere - not too stuffy - kinda perfect.   Park at the bottom of the Duquesne Incline and ride it up - it's located right next to the incline overlook - so great people-watching during dinner and a great date.  I honestly don't know if I have had that good of a meal in a while. It was just splendid. Again - the service was great - clearly the chef is extremely talented and all-in-all I can see this place doing quite well. A great night to celebrate 5 years!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, did not have a chance to try their food, since the staff at the door were quite rude and unprofessional. Did not realize that it could be such a problem to have dinner on Tuesday at 5 pm at absolutely empty restaurant with a baby in a stroller. First, they made us take steps upstairs, then realized that there is no place for stroller there.. Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"We don't normal go to placing like this but we got dresses up and off we went. The view was amazing overlooking the city. Lilia was a great help explaining the menus and made us fell good instead of uncomfortable. I can't say enough about the food and dessert and service that's to Lilia.  If you want a place where you can enjoy yourself while taking in the view and great food. You found it!"}
{"text":"First time here and will come back. We did not have a reservation, but it was mid week and they seated us with in 5 minutes.  The wait staff was excellent with water and season popcorn. The waiter read the specials and took our orders. I started with the She Crab Soup. So far the best in the area I have tasted. Kudos to the chef. The waitress offered a menu of wine, but due to the fact we were going back to work I had to decline. I   Ordered the Amish Chicken. It was a tender and juicy chicken breaths with vegetables.  The wait staff offered us three different styles of fresh bread and kept our glasses filled.  Finally, I know everyone says this, but I never get tired of the view from Mt. Washington.  One person in our party it was their first time to Pittsburgh. They enjoyed the view and their dinner. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is definitely a special occasion restaurant. The food and drinks at not cheap, but entirely appropriate given the quality of the food, service and view. The crab on toast appetizer was huge chunks of crab and a delightful sauce. The lobster bisque was also good. Try the pork chop; it really is among the best I've had. Get a reservation about an hour before sunset so you can enjoy the changing view. A memorable meal to be sure."}
{"text":"Despicable service.  We came in with family who were in town visiting.  We were denied service, even though everyone was dressed well, because my 2-week post-partum wife (on her first outing since before the baby) was in sneakers.   She couldn't wear other shoes comfortably, but the staff at Altius couldn't care less.  They denied everyone service and lost out on any future business they could have gotten from us, our family, our friends, and my business. And to top it off, as we left, a girl whose dress was so short that almost her entire backside (and most of the front) was visible to the entire restaurant was seated immediately.  How that manner of dress is \"classy\" but dark sneakers is worth kicking 5 people out is beyond me. If I could give 0 stars, that would be my rating."}
{"text":"The Venue is amazing. Great customer service. Food is bomb!!! The view is definitely a hit!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and i went for our 18th wedding anniversary. The outside is still under construction and i hope they can liven it up to represent what the inside has to offer. Goodbye dark gloomy Georgetown Inn and Hello fresh new bright modern Altius. You walk into an open airy atmosphere with an immediate view of the three rivers. We arrived early and were immediately seated. We faced the windows and had a great view. The owner stopped over immediately and welcomed us and offer to start us off with a drink. The waitress (Jill P) came shortly and was adorable and bubbly. Made the experience memorable. They provided a complementary unique shooter that was a salsa mix and was fresh. Fresh bread from the bakery was offered and delicious with multiple spreads. We ordered Charcuterie for starters that had many meats and spreads all of which were awesome. I had the prosciutto wrapped veal tenderloin which was cooked perfectly and tender. My wife had the jamison farm lamb rack which again was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. Topped off w a bottle of Hess cab. Desert was a chocolate mousse that we shared and to our surprise had a happy anniversary note in chocolate on the dish and comped. We were stuffed when we left. Ive been eating out way to much recently and this experience tops the list. Top notch new restaurant in Pittsburgh with a great view, great food and great service. Altius did it right!"}
{"text":"Great views, updated and modern design, attentive and friendly service but unfortunately food was not so great.  Crab soup was good, not great.  Sea bass was below average (disappointing) and peanut butter chocolate dessert was good, but not great.  We were there for a Monday night work dinner where it was a pre-fix, shortened, 3 course menu.  Wish I could give it more stars due to great staff and view but the food was truly 3 stars."}
{"text":"Start off your meal with a valet for $6,  oh you don' t have cash?...that'll be $10 on a card.  Things don't appear as advertised?   That is apparently the theme.  $32 for 'berkshire pork chop' that is listed as $28 on the website menu.   The server informed me that it would be cooked 'medium'  ( slightly pink)  which is perfect.   What came out was grey,  over cooked.  Like it was over cooked and held there for 20 minutes to dry it out on purpose.  It truly takes talent to so thoroughly ruin an ingredient like this.   Maybe this was just a fluke?  Nope,  another person at the table also had an identical ruined pork chop.   The manager offered to comp desserts for the error which is nice but not a remedy.     Another person at the table ordered the rack of lamb..$40+  and it was overcooked.   Really... this is unforgivable. Also, the gnocchi.   Flavorless and really not a pleasant texture.   Apparently the red snapper was delicious.    A gentleman behind us was ordering a steak  at the time we were leaving...I should have warned him the 'chefs'  can't handle cooking food to proper temps.   There were some good points to the meal.  The bread service was nice,  the truffle popcorn was a hit  and the desserts were excellent.   The appetizers were decent,  better than the mains.  Service: Needs improvement but was acceptable.  Overall the entire experience was painfully slow.  Almost a 3.5 hour dinner.   Took 25 minutes just to get the checks.  Another table also had to inquire about their food after a lengthy wait.  Restaurant was not even busy.  Suggestion:  Go to Altius for a drink and dessert with a view.   Want a good meal look elsewhere."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for our anniversary.  The service was great: everyone was so nice. Also, the view was absolutely gorgeous.   In regards to the food, appetizers were really disappointing. We got the steak tartare and cured green tomatoes. The cured green tomatoes didn't stand out much in flavor or texture. After we finished our appetizers, we were a little nervous that it was indicative of the rest of our dining experience. However, the entrees were fantastic. My girlfriend got the Chilean Sea Bass and I got the Duck, Duck, Goose. The DDG was fantastic. As most people mentioned in their reviews, it was full of unique flavors that paired well and had a variety of textures. I was extremely happy with my entree. My girlfriend's meal was perfectly cooked.  Overall, I think that Pittsburgh has such a big booming foodie scene with young, passionate, talented chefs that you can get unique and amazing dishes for a much lower price."}
{"text":"The shrimp dish was too salty for my taste, but the view was fantastic and the customer service was perfect. My boyfriend got the $45 steak (honestly...), but he said Ruth's Chris has even better steaks for similar pricing. The chef came out to see how everything was going. Expensive for two (but I even saw a family in there with small toddlers!), but we got a window table so it was worth it. Overall, a memorable dinner date with an unforgettable view. For pricing, though, I would save this place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This was an incredible experience.  I brought out of town clients to Altius for dinner and Bea and her staff made me look and feel like a rock star.  Aside from the amazing view, lovely atmosphere, great wine list and outstanding cuisine, the service was over the top.  Also love Bistro 19 in Mt. Lebo."}
{"text":"No idea why it has such a good rating. I had the beet terrine, it was horrible. They put goat cheese in a fried ball when it was supposed to add another layer of flavor. It was so much worse than the one I had at Eataly. Eataly's beet terrine (same dish, different name) has a mix of ingredients whose flavors compliment each other, creating a wonderful combination. Here it's just scattered all over the place. It is not a symphony but the noise coming out of the first practice.   Then there was the main course. It was just ok. The air conditioning was so strong that my dish went cold when I was still eating it! Then there came the dessert. The chocolate ball was pretty, the cake was very delicious with abundant flavors, it was the only good thing about the food. However, the hot chocolate that is used to melt the ball could use a hotter temperature to create a better melting effect. Plus, the ball didn't bloom like other chocolate ball desserts. The petals simply fell to the plate.   The view was spectacular and the waiter was very warm. Still, I am giving it one star because of the horrible food. This is my first time writing a review on yelp because I never cared much to spend 5 mins of my time to write a lengthy review, but this one I have to do it. Stay away from this restaurant if you can!"}
{"text":"Top quality across the board. What you'd expect from a top 3 restaurant in a major city."}
{"text":"*****Excellent Restaurant ***** It rivals Eleven as the best restaurant in Pittsburgh***** Great location on Mt Wash overlooking the city, and more importantly, outstanding food/menu. Chef's complimentary aperitif and dessert are terrific. The Berkshire pork chop and Duck Duck Goose are a fantastic creation of obviously an imaginative chef. The oysters (in the summer) is a very pleasant treat. Good wine selection for any pairing with any entree. One more thing: the wait staff, headed by a terrific maitre' D , are clearly knowledgeable of what a relaxed dining experience is. None of that pushy over obliging waiter who wants you to slurp your food in a hurry. It's a good dining experience. It's a restaurant this town needs."}
{"text":"So this is my first time here after having been remodeled from the Georgetown inn. I happened to go to the GI right before it closed for a wedding rehearsal dinner.   Let's just say it should have been closed years ago.   The remodel was very upscale and nice. The views of the city are terrific. Easy valet parking so make sure you have cash.   Our server was nice but could have taken a little better care of us. For such an upscale place I expect top notch service.   Our party of 6 took over 2.5 hours which was really long. The fresh bread was a nice treat.   I had the duck and so did one of our other guests. One thing I hate is when two dishes have different portions. Mine had two less pieces of duck. The skin could have been a lot more crispy.   My wife's sea bass was really good and at the same cost as the halibut we choose the bass. Big portion and tender as can be.   My biggest complaint were the bugs in thee restaurant. We had bugs all over the window next to us. When your restaurant is built around the views you better make sure the windows are clean and bug free. There were 15 little flying bugs all over the windows and got us thinking we had ticks!!! Yuck   But I recognize that's a hard thing to control. Worth a second trip."}
{"text":"Everything about the food and the experience was exceptional....,,, except the dessert. It was odd and rather disappointing. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well, obviously, the view-- can't be beat! We came here to celebrate a special occasion. A nice, quiet dining experience. The food -- I had the duck with risotto -- was delicious! I forget the name of the drink I had, but it a mix of blood orange and cherry flavors -- also perfectly made!  A note I would like to add is that the staff was very professional and personable.  Sometimes you go out to a restaurant and you can just tell that they are a notch above, and this is one of those restaurants.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"?????? ????? ???????????????medium rare ?medium well? ?????????? ??????????? ????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Everything about my experience here was flawless. I was celebrating a graduation and made a note of it on OpenTable - I was consequently congratulated by the host and server (a nice touch).  The view is beautiful, which almost goes without saying. Even without a window seat, however, you'll still really enjoy the ambiance. I loved that it was a fine dining atmosphere but without stuffy white tablecloths.   The service was top-notch - efficient, polite, friendly - my napkin was even folded when I went to the bathroom. (Speaking of the bathrooms - they're immaculately clean and modern). We liked our tasting and flavored popcorn before our meal and everyone is sent home with a mini dessert in a little paper bag. It's really about the small details here that make it worth the price.  Our meals were also flawless - we had a strawberry salad, frites, Berkshire pork chop, ravioli, and a s'mores dessert. The highlight was definitely the pork chop - highly recommend.  Only downside is that you basically have to valet your car, which costs $6. Good valet service, however."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday dinner in February and absolutely loved everything we ordered. Some pretty a-typical things on the menu, but every course is wonderful! The view is to die for and the decor is modern and intimate. Much less stuffy than Le Mont and, in my opinion, better food and drink options. Will definitely be returning with family and friends."}
{"text":"I have been to Altius twice.  The view is superb, the food is good, not great, the service is good.  Unfortunately, the selection of wines is poor and terribly overpriced.  I enjoy having a good glass or two of full-bodied red wine.  It doesn't exist at Altius. No Malbec's, no Cabernets by the glass. So, I ordered a bottle of wine for $68 that the waiter recommended.  It was not full bodied as I had requested and had no depth.  We didn't return it, but in the future, I'll bring my own bottle of wine."}
{"text":"We went there for anniversary. Service was impeccable by all. We had duck,duck, goose and lamb chops. I am a bit discriminating, when it comes to food.  These were two of the finest plates we eaten in a long time. No wait. No fuss. Terrific view and modern decor. I would say 95 out of 100. Why? The wine list contains great wines.  However, there is no bottle as I recall under $50.  Alcohol does not need to be so pricey! I plan to go again."}
{"text":"While the view of Pittsburgh is stunning and the service excellent, the food was not. My wife, two daughters and I visited for a holiday dinner. We had a variety of entrees and none of them were great even though we spent well over $300 for our meal. The mixed drinks were not great either which they should have been for $10 a piece. I had to ask for egg white in my whiskey sour and then it still wasn't good. The menu selection is not great so you would think they would be really exceptional at making what is on the menu.   I should say that the server was very attentive to my wife's gluten free request as well as ensuring we had everything we needed.   I would be cautious about this restaurant and would recommend you try it before you take friends or family to avoid an unpleasant meal like we had."}
{"text":"Ruined my birthday. Just returned from here. They tried to seat me in a lowly corner rather than main area. Also no birthday dessert for me even though they knew it was my birthday. All tables around me got the birthday desert. I spent a lot of time going there and then returning from there. Waste of my day. I could have gone somewhere else. This is absolutely the worst place for your birthday if you're not wearing a white dress and not have a white skin yourself or someone accompanying you. Mine was dark grey dress and I am brown and i was with my boyfriend who is also brown.  Also the food was bland and not worth getting bags for. I didn't finish my food..neither did he."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here for our anniversary, and it's definitely worth the splurge -- maybe from the view alone! Very unique, high-end dishes and lovely service.   I honestly cannot think of a more perfect spot for date night!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Had a reservation, table was 40 minutes late and food took a very long time. Waiters and managers were very condescending. Good food, not the best service."}
{"text":"Disappointed based on the reviews.  We hoped it would be a restaurant where the quality of food is as good as the view.  Great service, mediocre food at high prices.  The sea bass and salmon combined many different flavors that did not match with a fried oily after taste.  The calamari was pounded to flat shape with greasy taste.  The oysters were good but little pricey at $15 for 4 of them.  The breads were more appropriate for breakfast."}
{"text":"I had a last minute business dinner this evening and was able to get a good table with a great view of the city.   The service was simply great. From the friendly hostess that greeted us, to our server who was attentive and knowledgeable about the food and drink menu, and he had a great, interactive personality.   The food was perfectly prepared, and all our table's guests loved it. Our European guests said it was the best they had yet had in the states, and were quite happy.   I will definitely come back for other businesses dinners."}
{"text":"Go to Mt Washington if you are visiting and go here if you are a resident. The upscale menu is one of the best, and it's changed often, I have had several of their fish dishes, and risotto is perfect. If they are on the Pittsburgh restaurant night, make a reservation, They have a private room for dinner parties or meetings that is nice too. The view, well, it doesn't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"Big expectations here. My mother told us it was the best meal of her life.  And she knows food. Altius didn't disappoint. I don't know if I would agree that it was the best meal of my life but it was certainly up there. Me and my husband went there Friday night for our 1st anniversary and it was amazing. Got the charcuterie plate as an appetizer. It was SOOOO good. Then we had crab bisque. Best crab bisque I ever had. I'll give the bisque the best in my life award. I got duck breast as an entree and hubby had a filet and both were perfect. For dessert we had a s'mores thing and the chef wrote on the plate \"Happy Anniversary\" in chocolate sauce. Everything from start to finish was great. Oh and I forgot to mention at the very beginning our waitress brought us out a bowl of popcorn which was so different and so good!  It really was a great night. The view rocks - I mean it's on Mt. Washington.  So, yeah cool view. It's awesome. Certainly pricey, but worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Beautiful view and excellent food. The pork chop is one of the best in the city. Upon being seated, you receive a container of daily made popcorn. The amuse bouche is presented which was a delicious ahi tuna the night we were there. The breads are house made and impossible to resist. Upon departing, you are presented with a take home bag of one of their dessert creations. Bring your appetite with you!"}
{"text":"Experience, Food, Atomsphere = all amazing!! Had a fantastic view to start with. Appetizer, dinner and desserts were excellent, very tasty and we would certainly go back again and again!!!!"}
{"text":"I need my thesaurus to accurately describe!  Terrific view, great service & amazing food!  What more could you ask for ~ it's the trifecta of dining.    Do yourself a favor & go."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and I reserved a table a couple weeks in advance. I asked to have a table by the window since it seemed like the best place to sit. We got there a bit early and were seated right away but it was at a table against the back row so we didn't really have a view of anything which was the main reason I picked to go there since we have only been in Pittsburgh a couple months. A table seated at the window was eating desert so it would have been nice if they would've asked if we would want to wait so we could have a better seat but they didn't. Even with that issue our waitress was awesome and very nice. The food was great and they give you a lot for what you pair for. They gave us a free desert with Happy Birthday on it for my boyfriend so that was nice. We will go back and hopefully get a window seat :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food and view. Highly recommend. We had the duck and it was perfect. Others in our party had the ravioli and the shrimp and it was delicious.  Great environment."}
{"text":"we were visiting Pittsburgh just for the night to see a show. we were recommended this restaurant in advance from a friend from the area. we were given an excellent table on the 2nd floor with a beautiful view. unfortunately even with advanced reservations, table placement is not guaranteed but every table seems to have some view. i guess we were lucky as the weather was terrible and the restaurant was not very busy.  we shared quite a bit at our table of 5. charcuterie, sweetbreads, the duck duck goose and the pork chop entree were all stand outs. desserts of the vanilla pot de creme, baked chocolate mouse and the toffee bread pudding also made the rounds. three different food gifts from the chef were a nice touch. side note - i am unfortunately gluten free but was very pleased to find that a large portion of the menu was safe for me and they also offered some of the best gluten free bread ive come across for delivering sauces and perfumed butter.  Maria was our fabulous server. professional, attentive, friendly.  as others noted valet parking is $6. we were dressed in multiple winter layers, so nice shoes/sweaters fit fine for the ambiance. i would recommend as well as return if ever in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. It was a cloudy day, but the view was still incredible. Service was slow, I think they were running understaffed. The fixed price menu is reasonable priced, including a cocktail/fresh juice, an appetizer, and an entree. I had a Virgin Mary, which was refreshing. I started with the fruit sampler, featuring local honey and cheeses. It was beautifully plated, and a great appetizer. For my main I ordered the challah french toast. It was decadent and delicious, but I could have done with a fourth of the serving size! Their coffee was also fantastic."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful.  Even without the magnificent view from Mt. Washington, it would still be wonderful.  Cocktails were delicious and they have a great wine list.  We shared an charcuterie plate as an appetizer, then had salads and mains.  I had the beet terrine and filet mignon while the hubby had a caesar made with kale and salmon.  Dessert was a baked chocolate mousse with banana ice cream that we split.  From beginning to end, there was not a misstep.  Food was perfect and service fantastic.  It is not a weekly destination for us as it is not inexpensive but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A beautiful view and modern atmosphere delight the senses before you've even had a chance to order your food. We started with cocktails that were well made and spot on. I loved the popcorn at the table when we sat down, it was the perfect snack to tide us over. I was also pleased to have the potato and leek amuse bouche - wish I could have ordered a bowl. I would have preferred that they offered more salads on the menu. The pork chop portion is huge and the Brussels sprouts are outstanding - savory and crispy.   Nathan, our server, was so polite and accommodating. My sea bass was succulent and buttery.  At the end of the meal the complimentary white chocolate brownie was the perfect dessert."}
{"text":"If you've read my review for CURE, this one will sound quite familiar.   Made reservations for a birthday dinner 2 weeks in advance for a Sat night.   Arrived and were promptly seated at an awesome table.   Like CURE, a modern atmosphere. Despite being packed and tables fairly close together, noise level was totally fine. Didn't have to shout, didn't feel others were eavesdropping on your conversation. These 2 restaurants are essentially equal at this point with the exception of the spectacular view at Altius. That being said, I'm there to eat not look. So how about that food/drink?  Started w/ the charcuterie plate with local meats and cheeses, as well as fresh bread. The rosemary foccacia was particularly stellar. The accompanying honey/molasses butter and sun-dried tomato olive oil were perfectly complimentary.   At some point our server also brought out a gift from the chef that was a 'shooter' of some kind with onion in it. I can't remember any more detail than that - but it was good.   For entrees we went w/ Duck, Duck, Goose and a Trout special. Both were fantastic and very well presented.   Since it was a birthday dinner, we were provided a complimentary piece of vanilla bean cheesecake - unexpected and a nice touch.   So at this point you may be asking - why only 3 stars? Remember I said this place is quite similar to CURE in my opinion?  But first - there's that complimentary popcorn people talk of...at one point during the meal our server just came by and swiped it off the table. Didn't ask if we were done with it, or anything of the sort. We just kind of looked at each other as if 'did that just happen?\". Now I don't eat popcorn so it wasn't necessarily an issue for me, but my date was enjoying it - until she was no longer able to! Strange.   Second - drinks. I got 2 cocktails, my date one cocktail and a glass of wine. Wine is wine. Cocktails - pretty watered down, particularly at $12/pop. Pretty much sugar. Usually 2 cocktails has me feeling pretty good - I couldn't even tell I had a drink at all here.   I would have ordered a beer, but $8 for a Great Lakes draft that's $3.50 at Giant Eagle of all places is just a little ridiculous on the mark-up. I'm sure the rent on Grandview is high, but c'mon.   Third - while the food was excellent, just as CURE, it's simply over-priced for what you get. Portion size on my dish at least, simply didn't measure up to the price tag. One app, 4 drinks, 2 entrees, 1 shared dessert, and $160 later - and I'm still hungry.  Compare that to the $95 I spent at M&P earlier in the week for a Southern Tier tasting with 5 courses and 5 beers where I left uncomfortably stuffed, and well...  Fourth - Service. Overall - very friendly and genuine. But the pacing is SLOW. I don't think it was anything on the part of our server, it seems planned that way. It was a Saturday night as well, so it was busy. Were offered more bread and accepted, but it took almost 15 minutes for it to arrive it seemed. 2 hour seatings just aren't my thing. To be fair this is just a personal preference, as some are the complete opposite and are totally content sitting there all night long.   One last thing that rubbed me the wrong way. I wanted to try the duck reuben off the bar menu IN ADDITION to my Duck, Duck, Goose entree - yes I eat a lot -  but was told I could not do so where I was seated. What's the difference where I am seated?! It's the same kitchen?!   One of the only times somebody has told me they DIDN'T want more of my money, and therefore more of a tip. Again, strange.   So it's hard to justify, even for special occasions. If somebody wanted to go, I wouldn't turn it down or steer them away, but I wouldn't seek it out either. Just ok."}
{"text":"I have dined here twice and both times were outstanding.   During this visit the staff was very accommodating about a change in the number in our party and went above and beyond to seat our large group together and with a truly amazing view. We were there the same night as the review just below so I won't duplicate all the bread and amuse Bouche descriptions, except to agree that they were all delightful.  We had a nice chat with the sommelier (after excellent cocktails at the bar) and had three bottles between our party, all great. Between all of us we had nearly every entree and appetizer represented and all were excellent. The filet was moist, the ravioli rich, the duck medium rare, the fish flaky.  I had the crab bisque to start and it was one of the best soups I've had in my life.  We all had dessert: chocolate cheesecake, ice cream, orange creme brûlée, pear tart...all fantastic.  Finally, our server, Salena, was absolutely perfect. Knowledgeable, attentive without being intrusive, funny, warm, and handled our separate checks without any hesitation. She was every bit as wonderful as the views.  Do not hesitate to try Altius; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Superb!  Two guests raved about the halibut.  They said it was so good you want to lick the plate clean!  We had to order it.  They were right....exceptionally delicious!!"}
{"text":"View was great! Sarah's service was impeccable. Food was very good, albeit over priced. Very surprised and disappointed that there were limited wines by the glass, not even one red zin. When I asked Chris, the sommelier, just to open one of the zins and pour me a glass, he refused. To their credit when we were seated beside some loud and boisterous thirty-somethings so that we could not hear our friends across the table, we asked to be re-seated, which they did with no hesitation. They lost one star for the wine thing and one for being too pricey."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday evening.  The parking is not great but they do offer valet for $6.  We found street parking about. block away.  The exterior and neighborhood doesn't look like it would house such a nice restaurant but the interior is quite elegant.  They have 2 levels.  As it sits on the top and edge of a hill next to the Duquesne Incline, there are spectacular views of downtown Pittsburgh and the Three Rivers area.    The service was first rate.  The appetizers, main courses and desserts were all excellent.  The wait staff came by at just the right times to check on you, take your order, remove your dishes and present your bill.  Allot yourself at least 1 hour 45 minutes to have a comfortable meal here.  And remember to dress up a little before coming here."}
{"text":"Went with my wife on opening night for our wedding anniversary.  They are still working on the exterior and second floor but we were impressed with the main floor and view of the city.  The service was above average and there were plenty of people checking up on us during the hour and a half we were there.  The food overall was very good.  By course, and I'll comment on both items because I did taste my wife's dishes: -starters:  the tuna crudo was excellent and full of flavor.  \"Tongue and cheek\" satisfied my beef craving and loved the pierogi. -entrees:  \"duck duck goose\" was enjoyed by my wife and she really loved how well everything tasted together.  I continued my beef streak with the filet mignon which was very tender but slightly smoked which it did not need. -sides:  tried the pommes frites which were addicting -desert:  ordered the chocolate mousse dish which was perfect for our sweet tooth -drinks:   I had the seelbach which was a bourbon base-nice and strong, and then had a well paired Cabernet with my steak.  My wife had the accomplice which was a well balanced vodka drink.  She had the same Cab with her duck and finished with a desert wine which she enjoyed.  We are looking forward to going back and trying other menu items and checking out the second floor once everything is finished.  Definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. My fiance and I went here after his proposal and it was perfect. We had window seat at night with a perfect skyline view. Everything was presented beautifully and tasted as good, if not better, than it looked."}
{"text":"The most rude and unprofessional people I have ever met. We made a reservation two weeks in advance for Mother's Day on OpenTable and specifically asked to have window view and that if they could not do that, they should let us know immediately.  They waited till one hour before our reservation to tell us they could not supply window seats, essentially doing so in the hopes that we would be forced to go there without any other recourse as Mother's Day by then would be totally booked.  We promptly cancelled our reservation and would never go there again. These people are out for making a buck without any respect to their customers."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our first anniversary here recently. I wanted to take her to a place with impeccable style, unforgettable food and drinks, an amazing view of the city, and professional staff. We usually eat good food at home, and when we do go somewhere nice we want everything to be amazing.  There's a few places on Mt Washington that seem to be nice, but Altius is the best hands down. We had the King Salmon and Lobster Ravioli, a bottle of Viognier, some artisan bread, and orange sorbet. Altius may be the best restaurant experience that I've ever had and my wife loved it. Total slam dunk for our first anniversary. We want to thank the staff and the chef for making it very special."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came here for a special dinner and it exceeded our expectations. The design is beautiful and you can't beat the view!  We had a few cocktails (both delicious), shared the charcuterie for a starter, and the duck duck goose and berkshire pork chop for our entrees. SO GOOD!   I moved to Pittsburgh from NYC two years ago and this is easily the best meal I've had here so far. (Much prefer it to Cure or Meat and Potatoes for example).   Often times fine dining = small portions. This is not the case at Altius. Portion sizes were large enough to feel full upon leaving the restaurant.   Service was friendly and prompt.   *The popcorn was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Altius provided one of those memorable nights that rarely comes along. Altius is the perfect combination of great food, great atmosphere, great service and spectacular drinks. If you dine anywhere in Pittsburgh, dine here.  The pork chop is their signature dish and after the first bite you can tell why.  AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere and new/unique foods! Came here for a birthday celebration and was definitely not disappointed. The lamb was amazing and so was the s'more dessert."}
{"text":"This is hands down best place to eat dinner in town. Take a ride on the Duquesne Incline and enjoy the best view of the city. They have the best service and are so friendly. I am so lucky to have dined at this amazing restaurant! Thank you so much for everything!!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I came to Pittsburgh for the Art Festival and thought we would have dinner at Altius, since we had received a recommendation from a local. The service was very good and we were very impressed with the over all attention; but the food was another story. I ordered the Salmon and Lobster which was excellent and  my wife had ordered the Lamb, which arrived over cooked. Our server  Cheryl, took the dinner back and 20-25 minutes later (and after I had finished my dinner) the second lamb arrived and it was raw, which again was verified by the server. So now, she took it back and my wife changed her order and  waited another 20-25 minutes. I  then watch my wife eat her dinner well over an hour and 15-20 minutes after arriving to Altius.  It was a terrible experience, when ordering a lamb dinner at $40 bucks it would be nice to have it prepared correctly.  You would have thought the entire dinner would have been compted, but no. My wife's dinner was compted but after such an experience, you would have though the management would have stepped up and said \"hey guys we blew it\" this dinner is on us. That never happened!. We think we have figured out why these things happened. At about the same time all this started to happened, the current Governor of California, Jerry Brown, arrived and it seemed that all attention was directed to him and I think our order was affected; since he had more servers than Mike Tyson had in his hay day. The next time we are in town we will give them another chance; my wife still wants to try the Lamb!  Rick & Brenda"}
{"text":"Finally mount Washington has a restaurant worth going to. I would highly recommend the \"duck duck goose\" entree. There were some minor things that could be better, but they are still working through Being a new restaurant."}
{"text":"ok here it goes. I love food and dining. the only reason this place got 2 stars is because of the great dining room and service. I feel a sense of false advertising with this place due to all of the high rated reviews. defiantly not the case...wake up people and read between the lines. So we were sat up stairs during a 1/2 filled dining room. like i said beautiful setting. we ordered crab soup, oysters, tartar, duck, steak, and cheese cake.  i honestly wouldn't recommend anything to anyone.  the soup was sour and way to acidic. (don't call it she crab just because the minimal crab roe) it was a comical joke.  the oysters were warm and on a bed of seaweed, the person shucking them clearly had no idea how that is done...it looked like chopped clams in the shell, i also hate chewing shells...i didn't finish the one that was in my mouth.  the tartar was like a meat paste and an extremely unpleasant texture. what a lack of seasoning.  thats because the potato chips had all of the salt.   the duck was a miss as well. ZERO seasoning, super greasy \"liver\" polenta, poorly done duck confit and a sauce that was almost a ghost. the duck was clearly frozen crap and poorly cooked.   the fact that the compared them selves to an Alinea and Per Se styled restaurant make me hate this place after that experience. I saved up all my money to eat at both of those restaurants and i can tell you that the comparison is not there and they should be ashamed to claim thats what they are like."}
{"text":"Wow. One of the best modern American restaurants I have been to in the Pittsburgh area. Overall an excellent place for a date given well-prepared and flavorful food, a fantastic view of the city and great atmosphere.   Ambience: Having been to some of the neighboring restaurants in Mt. Washington, I can comfortably say this place has one of the best views. It is perched a bit higher than LeMont although without the ceiling to floor windows. I was a huge fan of the modern decor, which is a welcome change from LeMont and Monterey Bay next door.   Food: Kudos to Chef Jessica! I had the short rib and holy hell was it moist and flavorful. I'm not a big red meat fan overall but I would return for that dish any day. The asparagus on the side was a bit bland and greasy but the risotto made up for it. The real winner of the night was the Pumpkin Cheesecake- creamy, well-spiced with plenty of pumpkin flavor! Definitely not for the non-pumpkin enthusiast. One of the best desserts I have had in quite some time.   Price: Since it was a special event I didn't have to foot the bill, but based on their menu, expect to pay the usual Mt. Washington premium (~$50-75 per person). That being said, on the right occasion, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time! Everything was wonderful....the cocktails were awesome, the bread they come around with and the extras they serve you are a great touch. And, of course, the food...I've never been so indecisive trying to pick my dinner. This is not a place I can frequent, unfortunately....but I will be back for my next occasion. We ordered the sea bass and duck entrees...fantastic. I NEED to try the pork though! The restaurant itself was not so upscale that it was uncomfortable...quite the opposite. The service was outstanding and I could really appreciate going to a restaurant where I don't feel like I'm in the middle of the conservation of the folks around me."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here for New Year's Eve.  There was a 4-course prix fixe menu.  1st course:   Steak tartare (me).  Delicious, perfectly seasoned large portion. Put it on a piece of the grilled naan with some of the potent, coarse mustard and you have the perfect hamburger.  Crab toast (wife).  Also very good, lots of crab.  Win: me  2nd course:  Calamari Milanese salad (me). Not a big fan, it was just OK.  This was more of an arugula salad with a fried calamari steak on the side.  The salad had too much dressing and the squid was too breaded and over cooked.  Crab bisque (wife). Delicious, rich and buttery.    Win: wife  3rd course:  Rack of lamb (me).  Cooked perfectly, purple potato and butternut squash gratin was a great complement.  Filet mignon (wife). Also cooked perfectly, mashed purple potatoes were delicious.  Win: tie  4th course:  Only one option was provided.  The strawberries and champagne.  They were good, nothing exquisite, but to be fair we were both so stuffed it would have been hard to comprehend anything more complicated.  Overall this was a close battle, but I will give the win to my wife since the gap between the second courses was much bigger than between the first courses.  PS, the view was unbelievable."}
{"text":"This place has very nice view of the city and the food is fantastic. The most expensive dish at this place is $44, totally worth it. If you are a party of 2,order 2 main dishes, 2 drink, you may walk out with a bill about a hundred dollar. They will bring you some breads and dressing to start(free). They may also bring you chef's newest invention (free).It could be a little pricey compare to daily dining, but it's a reasonable price for a romantic date. The food is elegantly tasty and neatly decorated. I would recommend the \"Pennsylvania duck breast\" and \"Mule, with a kick\" cocktail.  Dress code: Girls, you may want to wear a dress,something dressy and heels. Boys, maybe button down shirt. I only saw one couple who wear polo shirt and knee length shorts on the day I came. They seemed out of place because everyone around wore button down shirts and dresses. Not necessarily very fancy clothes, but do dress up a little bit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing very accommodating we did a last-minute birthday reservation and they were able to accommodate us and even brought out a beautiful plate for my birthday I would give five stars but they packed my leftovers and when I revived it the rib eye was cut off the bone I wish they would have asked first before they made that decision. Other than that it was an amazing experience great food and The view of the city was breathtaking."}
{"text":"Pricey, but the best food among the fine restaurants with city views on Mt. Washington.  The prosciutto-wrapped date appetizer sounds odd but the taste was fantastic!  The service was friendly.  Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for out 1st anniversary and couldn't have been more pleased with our choice! We were greeted quickly and escorted to our seats where we had a fantastic dinner of lamb and a seafood rigatoni. The attention to detail was noticeable and allowed for my wife and I to relax, enjoy the view, the food and eachother. The staff was attentive without being overbearing and made our night one to remember. Perfect food, scenery, and staff!!"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday celebration and I wasn't disappointed. A great view of the city with contemporary decor (nice change from the stuffiness of other longtime Mt. Washington favorites)  From the flavored popcorn to the variety of fresh breads the meal was off to a great start. Everyone in my group enjoyed their starters (baby kale, watercress salad and sea scallop), entrees (chilean sea bass/special, line caught halibut, butternut squash ricotta gnocchi and filet mignon) and the variety and creativeness of the mocktails and cocktails. Our nine year old rated the dinner 100 thumbs up :)  Table service was attentive   We plan on a return trip!"}
{"text":"Altius has a wonderful view and very attentive service. You feel very special when you are at the restaurant. I will say that the food is slightly less than 5 stars. We have said that everything looks and feels perfect there, but the food is not quite up to the level we would expect considering all the hype around Altius. It's great for a special occasion. Make sure to time your visit with sunset.   They did do a special birthday dessert for me when we visited. It's a lovely touch."}
{"text":"I went there with a colleague and we both got food poisoning.  Upon notification to the restaurant they stated they did not believe that occurred.  That they believed I was ill but stated it must have been from my lunch as they had training that illness from food poisoning does not occur as I described.  Well it was too much of a coincidence that we both were ill after eating there when the two us had never been together prior to. And got sick within hours after leaving.  In addition, the urgent clinic that I went to diagnosed it from my symptoms. The manager offered me a free meal...I graciously declined as I am not interested in eating at a place that not only gave us food poisoning but denied that fact that it occured.  They also need updated training on how it can impact. someone as they are limited in knowledge on the subject."}
{"text":"I am not one to go to a place like Altius often, especially when the prices are even HIGHER, but I wanted to treat my girlfriend to a Grandview restaurant for Valentine's Day and Altius seemed like our best bet.  Reading through some reviews of other Grandview restaurants on here, I had the following thought: restaurants like these can either make the diner feel special and that they're lucky to have you or make the diner feel like the restaurant is special and you're lucky to be there. Altius falls FIRMLY on the former. We slightly overdressed just to be safe but we were made to feel comfortable throughout the entire process. Not a single second of pretense. The valets, the greeters, our waiter, and every person who served our food or filled our water was great.  I try to get around to as many places in town as I can. Granted, as already stated, I am not a veteran of PIttsburgh's high-end dining, but I know good food (at least I like to think so!) and this was one of the greatest meals I have had in my life. We were there for Valentine's Day so it was all about the prix fixe menu but there were plenty of options on there and we didn't feel limited at all. I ordered the veal sweetbreads, cauliflower bisque, lamb, and half-baked brownie. She ordered the tuna poke, she crab soup, ribeye and shrimp, and chocolate bombe. We both agreed that I had out-ordered her (a rare win!) but we both couldn't believe some of the flavors we were tasting. And I haven't even mentioned the INCREDIBLE bread and the tasty popcorn, both of which it seemed you could have as much of as you wanted if you so desired.  My personal favorite of the night was the herb-crusted lamb. It was served with a cassis whole grain mustard, parsnip puree and green beans. I am a sucker for lamb so I may be easy to please here, but I thought the portion size was right on, it was cooked perfectly, and everything served along with it enhanced the flavor in fun, interesting ways.  We were seated in the corner, right next to the windows. It may have been the best seat in the house. I'd like to thank Altius for giving my girlfriend and I a meal we'll never forget and nothing but fond memories of the entire experience. Amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"The view alone is worth the 5 stars. However, the exception food, friendly staff, and inviting atmosphere adds to the experience. We went for the New Year's Eve tasting menu. Every course was delicious and I wish I could have eaten more but I was so full! It is pricey but worth the value & quality."}
{"text":"Amazing view! Great place for the once in a while special occasion to avoid burning a hole in your pocket. Food was very sofisticated and delicious. Waiters knew every detail about the dish which was appreciated. They bring in small appetizers and compliments from the chef, which was pleasant. Portion size is pretty small.  I guess you are paying for the view and hospitality more than the food."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  The food was amazing.  The service was superb.  Happy to have this gem in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent all around. Food, service and view are fantastic. I had the green tomato salad with burrata and prosciutto, sea bass with lobster cous cous and peanut butter bar dessert. Fabulous! Modern decor and nice wine and cocktail selection. Valet parking available for $6."}
{"text":"Altius is, quite sincerely, the best place to eat dinner in the city. Not only is it literally in the best place, but it's also among the best dinners. I had the best cut of fish I've ever tasted (wild caught Chilean sea bass), the honeycomb on the charcuterie board was mind blowing, and the rum cocktail was both planned and executed with mastery.  When it comes to restaurants featuring entrees for $40+, life changing provisions should be expected. This leaves atmosphere, setting, service to earn the fifth stars. The wait staff at Altius is a dream team. The service was absolutely impeccable, and our waiter had a shadow.   Every single person that served us, from the host stand to the food runners, wished us a Happy Anniversary. This may seem like a small detail because it is; the devil is not in the details themselves, but is rather in getting them right. Having worked in the service industry for many years, I can tell you this little detail takes a level of dedication to service and teamwork that most institutions do not bother with, even among the highly revered. The payoff of things like this is not perceived as a line item in the ledger. It's simply one of the nuances of fine dining that separates the best from the rest and it left an impression on us.  I used the flower service recommended by Open Table, and they were waiting on the table on our arrival five minutes early. Another detail, another devil.   The food and drink was excellent, but the service is the capstone. We thank you for a perfect anniversary celebration, and want you to know the labors of the entire house were not wasted on us."}
{"text":"We took the Duquesne Incline up, which puts you right next to the restaurant, arriving for our reservation and seated immediately. Seating wasn't bad, we didn't get a window seat, but you're within about 5 feet of the windows and just surrounded by a nighttime view of Pittsburgh.  Within 2 minutes our waiter was there to take down our drinks, we needed more time so she brought us each a water and a cup of popcorn. I settled on a new fashioned and she ordered \"what she's having.\" Both were pretty good.   For dinner I ordered the Pennsylvania Duck Breast medium rare and she got the Pennsylvania Amish Chicken Breast.   While waiting for our entrees we were served fresh bread with 2 dip/spread choices, which we enjoyed.  Our entrees came out at just the right time. This was my very first time eating duck, so I can't compare it to other places or flavors, but I enjoyed it. I sampled her chicken but didn't care for it, liking the duck much better. She was the opposite, liking the chicken over the duck.   When paying, we were giving complimentary of what resembled a chocolate brownie.   All and all the place and ambience was nice, and our waitress was awesome. However, the lights kept dimming in and out  which kept interrupting the mood, not sure if this was done on purpose or is a problem with the building.."}
{"text":"If you want to be treated like a VIP and see a gorgeous view while you dine, be sure to make a reservation at Altius, and remember the time.  Thankfully our reservation was on a less busy Monday night so when we blew it because (1) I got the time wrong (2) we took the wrong highway and (3) traffic made it even harder to back track, it was not a problem for the restaurant to accommodate us with a new reservation/table when we finally made it an hour later.  Upon arrival, we were invited to sit in the bar while they readied our table.  I like this two step dance because it gives me a chance to study the drink list, see what everybody else is having, and enjoy the view.  My other half doesn't like this dance so much, especially because the bartender stepped on his toes (served his scotch on the rocks instead of neat), whoops!  Bartender was very apologetic and tried to correct the misstep.  Meanwhile, I ordered \"What She's Having,\" mostly because I just wanted to say it out loud without laughing, but I failed.  I bet they are tiring of this routine and will probably be glad to take it off the menu.  The drink is made with sparkling wine, St. Germaine, and real rhubarb and strawberry.  It's refreshing on a hot day/evening, but very sweet.  Next time, I would rather \"Wine About It\" or \"Have the Last Laugh.\"  After we had our drinks, we were escorted upstairs to a roomy booth.  It was not window side, but still had a great view (most tables provide great views).  So this view I keep obsessing about--the rivers below, the city, the bridges, the stadiums, and upon night fall, the lights!  Sooo pretty!  A true delight for the eyes.  The room and table settings, also very pretty with lots of white and subdued blues/greys, glass, silver, and just the right amount of light to make everything sparkle.    Soon after we sat down, our server Maria introduced herself and offered us still or sparkling water and left us a sampling of fancy popcorn.  Service does not get any better than this.  Throughout the evening, Maria was also doing the 2 step dance in that she was always 2 steps ahead of us, providing everything we needed and then some, and she did not step on our toes :-p.  After an experience like this, it is extremely hard to re-adjust to service at one of the usual chain places, and so we will have to pinch/slap ourselves as a reality check when we dine at less fabulous establishments.    And of course, the food!  The food was fabulous!  The chef sent out an amuse-bouche, and we gobbled it up.  I am not even sure what it was, but it was good!  The bread basket was also quite delicious and was accompanied by a dill and cream cheese spread as well as a sun dried tomato spread.  Not getting enough veggies on this vacation, I ordered the Baby Greens salad, and my mister ordered the Duck Steamed Buns.  The baby greens were fresh and colorful, and those Duck Steamed Buns were yummy.  With just those starters and a glass of red wine, I would have been completely satisfied.  But since this was our first time here, we had to progress further through the menu.  So for the entrees, I selected the Chilean Seabass and mister had the Pennsylvanian Amish Chicken Breast.  Both were delicious, and I especially enjoyed the French greens that came with the sea bass.  For dessert, we shared the Blackberry Lemonade.  A very unique dessert that became more and more scrumptious with each bite.  Such a lovely evening!  Highly recommend!  Make a resevation but come early for drinks and soak up more of that amazing view."}
{"text":"Outrageously good.   Last weekend, my fiance surprised me with reservations to Altius. It was our first time here, and I hope we will return many, many times. Our meal here was the very best meal I've had in Pittsburgh.  We pulled up to the restaurant and we were very pleased to find that there was plenty of free on-street parking. As we entered the restaurant, my fiance gave his name and we were promptly seated upstairs. Of the times I've eaten on Mount Washington, the view from Altius has been my absolute favorite. The interior is modern without being busy.  We were seated and greeted immediately by someone offering water and truffle oil popcorn. Our server next greeted us. She was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She brought over our cocktails and amuse bouche.   For a starter, we ordered the Tongue in Cheek. It was delicate, cooked to perfection, and the perfect size to split between two. I was very pleased, as was my FI. In addition to a really beautiful balance of flavors, the presentation was also lovely. Bonus points for quality heavy flatware to dine with.  We were also given fresh baked bread with both butter and a tomato spread. Pick the focaccia bread and combine the two spreads. You'll thank me later.  For our entrees, I ordered the Duck Duck Goose and my fiance ordered the rack of lamb. My duck was cooked perfectly, served over polenta and with pate. It was incredible and the flavors were absolutely perfect together. My fiances lamb was also perfectly cooked, and he absolutely loved his black garlic risotto. We also ordered a side of the parmesan risotto. It was all wonderful.  To end the evening, we ordered the stone fruit cobbler and the chocolate mousse. I'm honestly not sure how we managed to eat these, because we had already eaten so much! The fact that we finished these, also, is a testament to how delicious they were.  It was a lovely evening, a wonderful meal, and I hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of business dinners and am from Chicago, so I've been to many fine restaurants.  I can easily say that this is the best meal I've ever had - to date.  We started with the cocktails - i got the Clover Club - a bit fruitier than i expected, but mostly because they were using real ingredients.  We also had the charcuterie appetizer - out of bounds, order two, you'll be happy you did.  We had 7 people so we ordered 3 - all of which were swiftly decimated.  I ordered the \"tongue 'n cheek\" appetizer, which was really great, but you have to like beef tongue.  I also ordered the \"Duck, Duck, Goose\" - the goose pate portion of this dish alone made my mouth scream with passion - it's that good.  I won't mention the baked chocolate mousse because i'm pretty sure it's illegal."}
{"text":"We came here for our 7th anniversary dinner at the end of January. We used Open Table to book our table and had no issues with it, thankfully. We waited at the bar for our table to be ready, and enjoyed a large booth all to ourselves with a decent view. Not the window seats we were hoping for, but not tucked away in the back corner either.  The popcorn and bread for the table was a nice touch. We had the \"Tongue n' Cheek\" to start, and it was delicious. Like nothing else I've ever had! I had some sort of lamb sauce pasta concoction for my entree and liked it very much. For dessert, we had the Peanut Butter Bar and the Mint Hot Chocolate Cake. I could leave the candied bacon behind, but it was enjoyable otherwise. The mint hot chocolate cake came out in a mug made entirely of chocolate and was delightfully adorable.   This place is a well oiled machine, with things coming out in good time and we didn't find ourselves needing anything since everything was already thought of. As good as it was, we weren't totally blown away by this place. I'm not sure what it was exactly, but I'm not sure we'll be back. Probably something to do with the price range!"}
{"text":"This was my fourth trip to the restaurant. Previously I had enjoyed my dinners. Last night, however, I had the ribeye special. The steak was tough, chewy and not well cooked. I was surprised, because I really like this restaurant ordinarily. However, that special was a great disappointment."}
{"text":"The Duck Duck Goose was perfectly cooked and was excellent.  The ambiance was perfect.  They have a terrific wine list.  The service was impeccable. My only complaint was that the charcuterie board was kind of basic.  Overall, a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Location is fabulous! What a spectacular view and ambiance. Definitely a place to take someone to impress! Service is also great, with a treat at the end (at least we had one).  However, the food. Not bad, not good, just ok. And this review is based on food.  But go there! Impress someone!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  We've never had a problem, and they always work around my food intolerances.  It is expensive, but there's no reason to dock a star just for that.  You get what you pay for.  It's nice to have such a great place so close to home."}
{"text":"Celebrated my 30th birthday here and the food and service were unforgettable.  Perfect place for a quaint dinner with friends or a romantic dinner for two. They sat us by the window and the view was spectacular. We never felt rushed once and they even brought out homemade birthday truffles! Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"While visiting Pittsburgh, I discovered that this city has become a quite the foodie spot. The first place I visited was on a top of the Mt. Washington with a spectacular view of down town.   The first floor had some simple interior, large windows, and lots of wines on the wall. It was actually nice and bright. Without much color or artwork, it was rather monochromatic and modern.  We had a business dinner setup upstairs, so off we went. The upstairs seemed smaller than the downstairs, but it still had good amounts of seating. The windows were really  big here too, giving the customers a beautiful view from up above. And yes, the view was pretty amazing, you got to see the bridge, downtown, and even the tram called Duquesne Incline taking people up and down the Mt. Washington as well. Super cool!   Since we were having a business dinner, they had a semi-secluded space, where it can be used as a private event area. The walls were made out of glass, so we still had a nice view of the outside and it did not obstruct from the natural light coming in and flowing throughout the dining area.  I started with a cocktail called Missed Connection, very refreshing. It had nice strawberry and ginger flavor, and had nice sweetness to it. They brought out nice amount of complimentary bread for the table, three different kinds: dinner rolls, onion breads (?), and foccacia breads. I had their foccacia bread and it was super tasty! It was one of the best foccacia bread I've ever had!  The dinner was pre-set, three course. I chose She Crab Bisque, Chilean Sea Bass, and Carrot Cake. They were all super fresh, high quality, and delicious. Much better than I expected. Full of flavor, very nicely plated, and I enjoyed them all.  The staffs were really great, very patient with our large group. They were friendly, polite, and we were well taken care of. I am not sure when I would travel back to Pittsburgh, but this is a restaurant that I would love to visit again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Altius on a Tuesday night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were incredibly impressed with the service and the food. What I particularly loved was the little \"gifts\" from the chef. The popcorn du jour is a nice touch and the fresh baked bread was great. We had a lovely intermezzo from the chef in the form of a pickled egg with watercress that was divine.   We had the butternut and marshmallow bisque to start and I thought it was delicious but my husband found it a bit too sweet. For our entrees, we chose the halibut and the filet mignon. My filet was perfectly prepared and came with wild mushrooms, baby carrots, and fingerling potatoes. I was surprised at how large the portion was. Normally, when you order filet in an upscale restaurant, it's a 6 ounce portion but this steak was 10 ounces!  Granted, the entree is $44 bucks but the chef didn't disappoint and I consider it to be worth the money. My husband's halibut was a bit overcooked and dry. The manager cheerfully apologized and switched out the halibut for the Chilean sea bass over lobster couscous that was melt-in-your-mouth amazing!   I was also very impressed with our server and her knowledge of the wines that were on the menu. She was spot on with her recommendations to pair with our meals.   For our dessert, we shared the Vanilla Bean pot de creme and were glad we did because that dessert was HUGE. It came with a blackberry sorbet and a raspberry gastrique. The sorbet was light and not overly sweet and the gastric was a great accompaniment to the richness of the creme. A cute little touch from the chef was \"Happy Anniversary\" written across the top of the dish.   Finally, the chef sent little bags of house-made cookies to go home with us. The view, by the way, is amazing! One caveat about Altius - it's expensive. Dinner for two with dessert (on the house because it was our anniversary) was $210 with tip. However, if you need a splurge and a reason to dress up and be pampered, Altius is the place to go.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very unique menu with delicious food but by far the most incredible aspect of Altius is the view! Sitting right on Mt. Washington you have a gorgeous view of downtown. 100% worth taking a trip to if you're in the Pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant and one, I can honestly say, with all my travels, ranks a five star here in Pittsburgh. The service was impeccable, the food is outstanding, and the view of downtown Pittsburgh from on top of Mount Washington is fantastic.  A great evening with friends!"}
{"text":"I had such a fabulous dining experience at Altuis. If I ever visit Pittsburgh again, I will be sure to stop by again. The view, food, and service were all impeccable!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal and excellent service. First time dining there and we will be back. Additionally, they offer a great view of the Pittsburgh skyline. They have an extensive wine menu, if you're into that. To start, they brought out complimentary popcorn, which was so unique! I love when restaurants bring out little starter bites from the kitchen, and when we left they gave us a finisher dessert type bite in a bag. The service was great with the waitress folding the napkin when my date when to the restroom. It reminded me of various Michelin Star restaurants we have been to.   The food was great! We had a fillet with crab meat which was excellent. The only downside to our experience was the main entree was a little greasy. The vegetables were covered in duck fat, which is good, but overwhelming when it saturates the entire plate. Also a few of the vegetables were so salty they were uneatable. Besides those few not so great bites, the meal was excellent and the service was outstanding.  Definitely recommend. Also they valet park for $7. Or you can ride the incline up (Id recommend the incline)."}
{"text":"On a short visit to Pittsburgh we made a reservation at Altius to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We wanted to pick a special spot with atmosphere and the description of Altius filled the bill. Needless to say the view was spectacular and the fireworks after the Steelers game made it more so. The service was superb. We had the charcuterie and the Chinese duck bao as starters each of which was wonderful. We split the special aged rib steak which was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The dessert was the panacotta with mango which was as beautiful as it was delicious. All in all it was a wonderful way to celebrate our special day."}
{"text":"First visit to the 'Burgh.  We rode the Duquesne Incline up Mt. Washington (which I would highly recommend!) w/o any dinner plans. Altius is next door to the observation deck and offers spectacular views of the three rivers area. After checking the reviews on Yelp, we decided to give it a try.  What a lucky break for us! We got a table within five minutes (reservations are advised) with a great view. Our meal was memorable...we enjoyed a charcuterie board. Our specialty drinks were spot on. The house- made breads were amazing...especially the zucchini bread. The complimentary gourmet popcorn was a fun surprise. We shared the bone-in pork chop. Tender, juicy and very flavorful. I'm sorry that we were too full to try dessert. We'll be back for that opportunity."}
{"text":"The view here is great at night, and the service was impeccable. As for the meals - overall I would say it was very good.  We ordered veal for the entree, medium rare with cream sauce and crab on the top. Both were delicious, though the veal was just slightly more cooked than expected.  Dessert was the chocolate ball and apple cider bombolino - both really good, it's a shame we were so full at the end that we couldn't fully enjoy and finish it.  There's a great deal of care and effort put into the food, and they're made from very decent ingredients. The aesthetics of the dining experience was also very pleasant. Would definitely recommend trying this place if you're in Pittsburgh and in the mood for a great meal with a view."}
{"text":"Meal was cold, sent it back and was still cold. Went with a party of 8. I ordered the ramen appetizer. This came warm but not hot. It tasted very good and had a nicely prepared scallop and crispy pork belly. For the entire I ordered a rib steak which was cooked to the proper temperature but arrive less than hot. The side items were colder than room temperature. I sent them back. Unfortunately everyone else was done with their entrees when mine returned. This time the steak was cold and the potatoes and brussels sprouts were slightly warm. The steak was so cold that the newly placed truffle butter wouldn't melt. The manager came over and offered to heat it up for a third time but at this point it seemed silly. He did comp my entree and also comped my desert, which was a peanut butter bar and was quite good. I ended up paying quite a lot but never got an edible entree after two attempts. This was my first visit to this quite expensive restaurant. The temperature of the food was inexcusable, especially at those prices. The service was excellent so I awarded the establishment 1 star. Even with the comped entree the bill for four was almost $300. I would recommend you stay away unless you are only interested in the view, which was spectacular."}
{"text":"Left all the kids behind and went out for a dinner date with our favorite friends the night of Snowmageddon, Jr. This place is beautiful. Service was excellent from valet, to hostess, to wait staff. And of course the view is amazing. The fresh breads with an herbed butter and sun dried tomato pesto were enough to make you forget your name. The drinks were very good and the beautifully plated food was superb. We tried a nice variety of menu items and nothing disappointed. The staff was friendly and paid attention to every detail of the meal without being intrusive. They took great care of us for the evening. We were in no hurry and they seemed happy enough to let us linger. Would highly recommend Altius for any-occasion dining. And if you're lucky enough to have friends like ours, you can forget your wallet at home and it won't be a problem."}
{"text":"The food is a 4 and the view is a 5. Be sure to go early to see the city in daylight, but still be there when the sun sets. Make reservations and request a table next to a window.   We didn't order an appetizer because there were only two of us and we weren't very hungry. This turned out to be a good decision since they bring you bread, the entrées are large, and we wanted dessert. My girlfriend had the Filet and substituted in Brussel Sprouts, which were delicious. I had the Sea Bass; also delicious."}
{"text":"This resturant was amazing. We were there Friday night with a party of 6. We had the most amazing view of the city. We were greeted warmly by our waitress that was exceptional! She was very attentive and had the best suggestions for drinks. The steak was cooked to perfection and the lumps of crab on top were delicious!! They didn't skimp on the crab either!! It was an amazing night. Everything was amazing and the little details were an amazing touch!! Highly recommend! !"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and setting.. I loved everything I tried. Will certainly come for more."}
{"text":"Went for our 29th anniversary. Always a beautiful view. Food was superb.Enjoyed everything. Our waitress,Ashley was excellent, helpful and just plain sweet. Thank you for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful and more wonderful is my first thoughts. Were from California with lots if great places to eat but this was top of the line all the way. The view, the service,  the food all top notch. Started with a taste sent by the chef lovely little pastry puff with yummies inside. Lobster bisque was excellent. I love the dishes white porcelain with scroll lines on the edge.  Dinner a 28 day aged rib eye with some fancy butter that made it mo yummy. Served with purple potatoe puree and roasted baby carrots. My daughter had salmon with risotto very good as well. Desert was good a modern flare on traditional deserts.  If ever in the area I will be back. Our waiter Yucefp (probably spelled wrong) was outstanding. The service was five star alone.  Thank you for making our trip even more memorable."}
{"text":"Our meal was absolutely unbelievable. The service was five stars. The view of the city was breathtaking. Highly recommend. I also forgot to mention the coffee - it might sound crazy, but it was the best cup of coffee I've had in my entire life. (And the coffee setup was delightful - raw sugar cubes and the perfect little milk carton shaped creamer)"}
{"text":"One of the most fav restaurants in the city. We tried the salmon and the scallops. Everything was super delicious. Not to mention the view! The best part of the dinner -for me at least- was the chocolate lava cake! I can't wait to go back even just for that!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food and service matched with a spectacular view!  My wife's birthday was coming up and I was trying to think of somewhere new to take her. We had gone to the Georgetowne Inn every Valentine's Day for years as they always ran a special and were the most affordable fine dining option on Grandview. I saw an article about Altius in Pittsburgh Magazine and immediately knew that, that is where I would be taking her. I easily made reservations through the Open Table App and notated that it was my wife's birthday and requested a table at the window if available.  My wife had no idea where we were going for her birthday. I just told her to get dressed up and that I would be wearing a suit. Once we started to go up P.J. McArdle Roadway she got excited. She guessed as we past each restaurant on \"Restaurant Row\" on Grandview Avenue until we pulled up to the valet at Altius.   Once inside we were greeted by the hostess and she also greeted my wife with a Happy Birthday as soon as I gave my name. We were about an hour and 15 minutes early for our reservation so we went over and had a seat in the bar area. We started off with drinks. I had \"The Point\" ($12) It had Absolut Vodka, Strawberries, Basil and Lemonade and my wife had a \"Havana 75\" ($12). It had Bacardi Superior, St. Germaine, Maraschino Juice, Lime Juice and Bubbly. We went with the Charcuterie plate ($14) as our appetizer. It features house made and local cured meats, Pennsylvania artisanal cheese, grilled breads, cornichons, pickled teardrop peppers, mustard, jam and honeycomb. While waiting for our appetizer we were brought some of that delicious complementary popcorn. It kind of took a while for our drinks and appetizer to arrive but, the place was packed and very busy. The Charcuterie plate was absolutely amazing. The meats and cheeses were just EPIC!  About an hour later I settled our bill and we made our way over to the seat to wait to be called for our table for dinner. Twenty minutes later one of the hostesses, Kris came and took us up to our table on the second level. Upon seating us at a table right next to the window she told us who our waiter would be and also told my wife Happy Birthday.  A few seconds later, Michael our waiter for the evening came over to tell us about the specials for the evening and also wished my wife a Happy Birthday. He took our drink orders which were the same as we had at the bar downstairs. A few minutes later he was back with our cocktails, a bottle of Nordaq Still water ($3) and more of that amazing popcorn. For entrees I went with the 28 Day Dry Aged Ribeye Special ($56) served with fingerling potatoes and baby carrots and the birthday girl started off with the Baby Greens Salad. ($9) It features pickled carrots, heirloom tomatoes, hot house cucumbers, aged balsamic vinaigrette and chose the Australian Lamb Rack as her entree. ($44) It featured herb crust, veal demi glace, risotto, grilled peach, crumbled gorgonzola, and roasted grapes.  A few moments later a waitress came by and offered us a choice of three breads with two different spreads to try.  Soon after our entrees came. My wife let me try her Lamb and let me just say that it was amazing! It was so good. My Ribeye was cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy it literally melted in my mouth. It was like beef flavored butter!. Once we were done with our meals Michael whisked our plates away to be packed to go so we could have desert. He told the birthday girl to pick any dessert off the menu since it would be on the house. She chose the Peanut Butter Bar (Chocolate flourless cake, peanut praline, peanut butter mousse, candied bacon peanut brittle, frozen banana custard, crème anglaise) It was simply amazing. Another waiter took our popcorn before we could say anything as we wanted to take it home since we had already had some at the bar. I let Michael know and he packed us a fresh full container of popcorn to take with us.  Michael's level of service was exceptional the whole evening as he took great care of us and kept my glass full. I think he told my wife Happy Birthday no less than 5 times throughout the evening.  Yes Altius is quite expensive as a dinner for two including an appetizer and a couple drinks can easily hit $250 with tax and tip but, the view, level of service and quality of the food warrant that type of price. Hell, even the water was the best I have ever tasted! Dinner here for a special occasion is a must!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place, great location and best view of Pittsburgh.  Nice interior , appetizers were great any one you pick"}
{"text":"The location was very nice high up on a hilltop overlooking Pittsburgh so try to get there close to sunset for the best viewing. Everyone was very attentive and the food was plated well. Being from los angeles did i think it was a 5 star, no. But the food was good, the service was good, the ambiance was great.  I would go for the view again but there are too many other restaurants out there for me to choose eating here again. I give it a overall 4.5"}
{"text":"Altius ranks as one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. I only say this because they've conjured up flavors I've never tasted before. The service was excellent, and the view of the city is spectacular."}
{"text":"I'm very happy with my recent trip to Altius.  From the bartenders, to the waiter, to the support staff, the service was fantastic.  The only problem  concerned the lighting.  As others have mentioned, it flickered frequently throughout the night.  It's a minor issue and didn't impact our enjoyment all.  The food was very good; it was priced just right for the quality, quantity and experience.  I can't wait for the next visit!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Got sat by the windows and the view is spectacular.  Sat at the bar while waiting for a table and people were on top of you. The only reason I can't give this place five stars is because the tables are too close together and there is no room in the bar. When the incline runs the lights would dim which was kind of annoying. I think it is overpriced too."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is beautiful, modern, and has a great space for private parties. I had the Chardonnay by the glass and unfortunately thought it was overpriced for such a brassy finish. I was excited for the green gazpacho and the presentation was fantastic, but I was confused by the addition of minced almonds which kind of texturally ruined an otherwise extremely promising starter with a nice kick. The texture confusion continued with the main course in a gnocchi that was gritty, along with it being under seasoned. The flavor profile and presentation were excellent though. Again, overall, nothing was bad, just mediocre. If you're trying to impress a date with food, just go to Isabela up the street. If your date is more into decor, go here. They both have the spectacular view."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to Altius the first night we got in to Pittsburgh and we absolutely fell in love with it. We sat upstairs by the window and you get an amazing view of the entire city of Pittsburgh. We got there at 530 pm while it was still light outside and got to watch the transformation from day to night and it was truly a sight to see.  Our server Sarah was amazing. She was very attentive and personable, and answered all of our questions.  Great service.  The food was outstanding. They give you complimentary popcorn, the days flavor was truffle! How sick is that?! Truffle popcorn?! Yes please! Then we got a complimentary little bite of seviche w/ cilantro & butternut squash served on a fancy apple slice (don't remember the name of the apple). Then we ordered the oysters appetizer. My girlfriend wanted to get them because she's never tried them before. I'm not crazy about oysters but I let her go with it because it's her birthday weekend...and these oysters were the best I've ever had. They were covered with an amazing salsa verde that was a perfect blend of spice that made the oysters really shine.  The main courses were sublime. My girlfriend ordered the salmon with risotto & mushrooms and it was delicious. I ordered the special which was a black grouper encrusted with porcini mushrooms, black garlic risotto and sauteed broccoli rabe. I do don't care for the broccoli rabe but that was literally the only thing from the entire night that I didn't like.   For dessert we split the black truffle cheesecake which was spectacular. It was served with pistachio praline, vanilla infused tangerines, and homemade vanilla bean ice cream. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Altius is such a great addition to the aging Mt. Washington restaurant scene. The sleek, modern interior and amazing views of the city really add to the ambiance. I've been here on a number of occasions and really enjoy sitting at the bar. The bartender, Isaac is one of the best in the city. He's full of personality and makes an amazing cocktail - especially his Manhattan. Next time you stop, you must request one. And the truffle popcorn they serve is addicting!   Our most recent trip to Alitus was to celebrate my birthday. If you can, request to be seated in the booths looking straight out to the city or right along the window. We, unfortunately, were seated right in the middle of floor which was both cramped and not very enjoyable. I do realize they need to maximize their seating in a small space, I just don't prefer to sit in the middle of the restaurant with diners on every side of you. But, other than the seating arrangement, our meals were fantastic. I had the Chilean Sea Bass and it was phenomenal. It was perfectly paired with a lobster saffron couscous. I will definitely be back for this dish again!   If you want to enjoy a special evening on Mt. Washington, look no further than Altius."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a birthday/anniversary/special occasion. Great ambience and the food was so good!"}
{"text":"Celebrating my daughters graduation! Beautiful views!  Staff was terrific!  Food was incredible!  Had a filet you could cut with your fork!  Deserts with a nice touch congratulating my daughter!   Nice touch!!"}
{"text":"The best food in the city, without question. Everything I tasted was more magical than the view."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, very nice service and an awesome view are a wonderful way to celebrate our six-month anniversary. We live in State College and vowed to return ASAP."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! We went on Saturday evening after exploring the city. There were so many great options when planning our trip that I couldn't decide on a place in order to make reservations. We talked to some locals and they recommended a few places, this being one. I saw online the dress code and my husband didn't bring dress shoes, just flip flops so I called and we were told we would only be allowed at the bar. This was fine for us, as we enjoy that as you can have a bit more conversation with the staff. The view of the city lit up was amazing-Even sitting in the bar area! The bar itself only has about 6-7 seats (more seats are available in the bar area) but we were able to get a spot within about 15 minutes. Our meal started with a great bottle of wine and black pepper popcorn- a new favorite! We were given an amuse bouche of crab cake, but the sauce was a bit overpowering. The bread service was great, they had a homemade zucchini bread which I wish I would have tried. We had apps at a different venue so we skipped right to the main course. I ordered the sea bass which was cooked to perfection and had an amazing crust. The risotto and beans were great too. Hubs had the pork chop and it was huge! I'm not usually a fan of pork, but this had great flavor and was incredibly tender. The purple potatoes and carrots were great too! We were heading to dessert at another venue (we did an impromptu progressive dinner) but we still received some treats to go.   Overall, one of the best meals we've had & would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The others are correct. Dined 9/14/2016. Everything was at it's finest: the service, the food, the view. Best pork chop I have ever had. They even bent the dress rules a bit as the men had walking shorts on since we had been to the museums all day, but I would have dressed up a bit otherwise. A fine special event place."}
{"text":"The setting is excellent - gorgeous views over the rivers.  Hostess and bar staff professional and welcoming.  Sat at bar and had nice aperitifs and were looking forward to our table, but then were sent upstairs where my wife (who is way more observant than me) noticed that the tables were without table cloths and the general ambiance was \"cafeteria,\" and though that's a bit harsh, it definitely wasn't as nice as downstairs.  The food was however very good, and the pork chop was the best I've ever had - and I've had my share.  (If this comes off as pedestrian-I've eaten at Per Se and similar joints)."}
{"text":"Had a big group of 15 people and they did an outstanding job... Food, Service, Location - 5 Star"}
{"text":"I don't do high scale dining often, so I'm very glad the one time that I did I went with this place. It is AMAZING with a capital A. First of all, the restaurant's interior is beautiful. Even if it didn't have the amazing Mt. Washington view, it'd still be gorgeous. It's extremely modern and interesting to look at.   The wine list is very extensive. I can't remember exactly what my table got but it was a dry red from California and it was very good.   Before they bring your food out you get a palette cleanser and an assortment of breads to choose from. The bread was so rich it was almost like a dessert, but I loved it. They even have a number of different butters and spreads you can try.  For dinner, I had the Duck Duck Goose, and it was spectacular. I love duck and don't get to eat it very often. I have to say this was the best I ever had. The one thing I loved in particular about Altius is you get a good portion of food. Some fine dining establishments have great food, but they don't give you very much of it. Believe me, you will be full after you leave here. We didn't have any room for dessert, but I'm sure it would have been as delicious as everything else!"}
{"text":"From the service to the expertly poured drinks to the incredible food it was all an experience I cannot wait to have again. Topped off by that view at Christmastime and its nothing short of magical."}
{"text":"Food was good. A bit overpriced but good quality.  Biggest gripe for us was management. The head honcho (manager) was a bit pompous, told us right off that he couldn't guarantee us a window seat even though we reserved 2 weeks in advance. Fine, but seems to me they could've handled that better esp considering we were seated in pretty much the opposite location... Nowhere near a window. Also waited past reservation time for a table, and were given a defensive response when we politely asked abt it. The bartender was not very responsive, although it looked like she needed more help.  The waiter was excellent. Nice guy, personable and quite knowledgeable.   We won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had dinner at Altius and we enjoyed it very much. The view of the city is excellent and surprisingly the food was \"5-star\" quality. Food:  I started with the Crab Bisque and was excellent as was the bread they served before the meal.    I had the Chilean Sea Bass with couscous. It might not have been the best Sea Bass I've ever had, but was very good. My wife had the Pork Chop...WOW..that was a big pork chop and prepared just perfect. We shared the Peanut Butter (something)  for dessert and was sumptuous.  Service:  When we first walked into this place I thought  \"oh no, it feels a little \"stuffy\" but Maria quickly put an end to that. She was so friendly and helpful and just made the evening enjoyable.  The combination of the great view over the city, food, service, ambiance, I can only think of giving this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Mixed emotions. My family and I went there yesterday and had different dishes. The service was great but the dish I had, the saffron pasta, was less than mediocre. And my aunt mentioned that her dish, was also just satisfactory. However our waiter was very helpful and brought me truffle cheese when I mentioned my pasta was bland. Overall I think you go for the view over the city (which is beautiful)"}
{"text":"Had a lot of food at Altius with friends. It was a very great experience. For entree, I had salmon, it was beyond my expectation! The fish was soft inside and crispy outside. It was also very flavorful!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Altius.  It's got the food, the service, the view, and the ambiance.  Great for special occasions, business dinners, and to impress friends who are visiting Pittsburgh.    I've been a couple of times to Altius and have seen pretty much everything on their menu and it's all great.  It's easy for a nice restaurant to be just about the view, but Altius really takes it away with their entrees.  The meat dishes are awesome and the special (which is usually fish) is worth ordering every time.  Just a note that some dishes come with sides so you may not need to order sides for the table.  The service has been impeccable every time. Friendly, fast, and considerate.  The view is iconic downtown Pittsburgh, you can see the rivers flow through the gothic buildings of downtown.  It's especially beautiful during sunset.    If you have someone visiting, seriously this is the place to take them to enjoy a night out!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place to celebrate special occassions. The service, food and view are magnificent. This restaurant is unlike any other you'll find in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently dined here on a whim. No special plans or events. Pure spontaneity!! I've tried a few restaurants here on Grandview Ave and nothing can compare to Altius. This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the city!!  I love the design of the room, from the spectacular view, the comfortable chairs and tables, down to the place mats used. \"Chilewich\" to be exact. I'm not even going to mention the china they use for the espresso!! OMG, I want! They really thought about their customers when creating a space to experience this level of dining. We can appreciate that!!  Once seated, I was immediately mesmerized by the view. Pittsburgh is beautiful. We were taken care of by a young gentleman, good manners, friendly. I don't think I can complain about anything. The customer service was stellar! But if you want to know why, it's because he never crossed or reached across our table while we ate, he never touched the rims of our glasses to fill our cup, he always came back to check on us and offered more wine and water (tap). The servers never touched the rims of our plates. The appetizers and food came out at appropriate times. Everyone who worked there looked like they LOVED their jobs. When you have a restaurant like this, all the minute (not minute ;p ) differences can make or break the experience.  Appetizer Charcuterie with artisan cheeses from PA and house made and local cured meat. Comes with lots of fun things like honeycomb, jam, whole grain mustard, pickled veggies, grilled pita and focaccia bread. I love this because the favor combinations are endless and fun!  Entree Berkshire pork chop Colorado rack of lamb Both were well seasoned, succulent, juicy, and cooked to perfection, large portions! Bone marrow red wine risotto: buttery, creamy, the red wine gives a slight tang flavor. It's delicious!  Dessert Malted vanilla bean Pot de Creme with spiced cider sorbet and raspberry coulis and shortbread cookies. YUM! Limoncello -  Sweet yet smooth and warms your soul.  Food. The food was excellent! What I loved about this restaurant, is that they are very generous with their portions!!! (Don't you dare change!!) You go to these expensive restaurants expecting lots of food but you get a few bites. Not only that but Altius takes that extra step in making the experience complete. For example, we ordered an espresso. We got an espresso. BUT we got an espresso with a biscotti! Why? Because why wouldn't someone want a biscotti with an espresso? It's like them saying \"Thank you for choosing Altius\".  I'm telling you, it's the little things or maybe I'm a sucker for those little details.  1. Stunning view/ambiance and design 2. Stellar service 3. Delicious food 4. Expensive but not overpriced 5. And little surprises along the way!  For all the reasons I've mentioned above, I will always come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing view, amazing food.    Everything from the complimentary dill pickle popcorn to the duck steam buns to the local zucchini with hallumi to the rack of lamb were delicious, but obey these four words: Get the Pork Chop.  Honestly could not even tell it was pork; it was simply melt in your mouth soft flavorful meat covered in bourbon brown sugar glaze.    Overall fantastic meal out with a perfect view of the rivers and city.  Recommend going around 7 to get pictures with sunset in the background after dinner at the observation deck right next door."}
{"text":"Came here for date night on a weekday. It was quite busy but we had reservations so were seated quickly. Service here is great- attentive and friendly. You're started off with complimentary gourmet popcorn as well as a bread offering that's probably one of the best I've had in the city! Hard not to fill up first on the bread!   We ordered the \"duck duck goose\" and a seasonal salmon dish as our mains. We skipped the appetizers as we tend to eat smaller portions to begin with, and already had plenty of bread and popcorn! The entrees were delicious and rich. Before our meal arrived, we were also treated to a complimentary amuse-bouche which tasted refreshing and perfect for summer (a halibut ceviche in a pastry shell). We skipped dessert as well since we already had plans to get ice cream elsewhere, but the dessert menu looked fantastic.    Prices are on the higher end, but you're most likely paying a bit more for the location/view. We easily managed our meal for under $100 for 2 drinks and 2 entrees and were quite satisfied. Quality over quantity.  Would certainly recommend for a special occasion or if you're showing off Pittsburgh to visitors."}
{"text":"There really isn't anything about this place that isn't five stars. The service was amazing, the food and it's taste, timing, presentation was simply perfect. You can't beat the view and my clients were very impressed when I brought them to this place. I couldn't have been more happier or more proud to say that this restaurant was in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I am visiting Pittsburgh so don't know anything about the area.  A friend found a listing for this fairly new place so we thought we'd give it a try. The atmosphere was great - everything was clean and the view of the city and river awesome!  Watching a storm roll through from that vantage point was fun.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about their food and wine menus. We had the tongue starter - neither of us had ever tried tongue.  I was pleasantly surprised it was so good.  The chef sent us a small sample of another starter - another pleasant surprise.  Unfortunately, I can't remember what it was called but it was delicious.  Some sort of chicken salad in a small tart-type crust.  Yum!  I had the pork chop and it nearly melted in my mouth - couldn't have asked for better.  If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, this place will be on my list again!"}
{"text":"Altius is one of the nicest places in Pittsburgh. The renovations to the old Georgetown inn are striking. They modernized and I like the new look. The view is still amazing. Service was outstanding. Very attentive. Good was fantastic. Had the sea bass and bone in steak. Both were top notch. Also had a bunch of apps. All great. This is a must visit. Great for a date night."}
{"text":"Great vibe. If thats your thing. Not my thing, but enjoyed it nonetheless. Gotta hand it to the waitstaff- they know their sh¡t. Very informed. Kinda got loud, but I enjoy lively atmosphere. Dem foods wuz dlish. The appetizers more so than entrees.  Would go back if on another's dime."}
{"text":"Fabulous. Pittsburgh has been waiting for a chic restaurant on Mt. Washington. Beautiful atmosphere, great farm to table food, fantastic service. Everything is a la carte,  a bit pricy for Pittsburgh, but well worth it. Loved it, Loved it, Loved it. Great evening."}
{"text":"I am a fan...BUT have the following complaints.  The lights need to be fixed ASAP. I was told it was going on for months and the constant light surges of light and dark are VERY distracting to one dining.  The popcorn...I expected more and even though its \"gourmet\" was not a fan and actually shocked that they would even serve such food at an expensive restaurant.  Overall- the view, the drinks, the food...WONDERFUL."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and excellent food! Speciality cocktails are everything!!! The chef and pastry chef are top notch! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The decor and view was the best with 10 stars.  Service, popcorn, breads, cocktails, and pork chop are 5 stars.  We weren't impressed with a few other dishes as for the quality level as compared to the cost and therefore I had to drop the overall rating.  As a global traveler who has enjoyed cuisines from some of the top restaurants in the world, I can't yet give Altius a rating higher than average.  I would encourage the team to reduce the main menu and create a few other dishes like the stellar pork chop with three daily specials to include a poultry/beef, fish and pasta.  The deconstructed dessert was ok but misleading based on name and would make sure the team educates consumers so their expectations are clear."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is unique in its landscape. Where else can you sit in a restaurant on top of a mountain with a direct and up close view of downtown. I, like everyone from Pittsburgh have been to Grandview many times for this experience but I wanted to try something new this time. I was very glad that we did. Altius has now set the bar for me for dining in the clouds. The service was amazing and they were extremely accommodating to specific requests from members of my family. The food is original and delicious. I recommend the curry popcorn as an appetizer. Of course the view is amazing but it takes a second chair to the food and the people there."}
{"text":"Fiancee took me here for my birthday a couple of months back. My only complaint is that we've only been that one time! Amazing food, perfect service and one of the best views in Pittsburgh. Can't wait to get back here."}
{"text":"I travel all over the world and eat at many restaurants and believe me when I tell you that this is one of the BEST restaurants that I have ever had the pleasure of eating in. We were a party of six and every single one of us could not be more pleased. The food was outstanding and the customer service was top notch. Ellen was our server and we could not have been happier with her. She made our dining experience a memorable one. The entire staff was amazing. We all really loved how we all got our food at the same time. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with modern decor and outstanding views. When I am in town again I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. My only complaint was that we didn't get seated at the window and we were further back. The view is still awesome though. They also don't take requests for window seats when you book a reservation which is also a bummer. My husband and I only make it back to Pittsburgh once or twice a year, so it would have been nice to have a better view at dinner, especially since we made our reservation early (5:30) not long after the restaurant opens. We would definitely return to Altius, but maybe book a reservation earlier (5pm) or a bit later hoping we would get better seats."}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary.  First time here and everything was just perfect.  Service staff was impeccable. They first bring you popcorn w/ kale in a stainless cone then a little taste of corn salsa.    We then started off with the charcuterie platter with various cheeses, cured meat, honeycomb, & more.  And we just had to try the She crab chowder. The server asked if we were going to share that also and they were so sweet and brought two bowls and poured the chowder into the bowls (w/ crème fraiche in the bottom) in front of us.  I had the scallops special that had a raspberry cream sauce on it.  Very good; didn't care for the rice that was with it, but that was just my taste buds.  Husband had the gnocchi which he liked, but said after awhile the cheese flavor was just too much. The Pom-Jalapeno martini was good but too strong for me. Didn't have dessert, but they sounded amazing.  They even give everyone at the table a little to-go bag with a chocolate brownie type square (not anything particularly over the top, but tasted ok)."}
{"text":"It seems that no Grandview Avenue restaurant can deliver on the perfect four:  1.  Great view 2.  Good food 3.  High level of service 4.  Reasonable price  I had high hopes that Altius would crack this 4 pronged Fort Knox after learning it is run by the same group as Bistro 19, but alas, it fell short on #3 and #4.  1.  The view is killer...  Leave it at that and look at the pictures  2.  The food, while not mind boggling, surpasses all other options on Mount Washington, so it gets a pass.  3.  The service... oh, the service.  A maybe it's because we dined at restaurant week, but it was lacking.  No one offered to take our coats, we never received the raved about bread service, the wrong table's meals were delivered to our table twice and ours were delivered to another...  It just was sub-par for a joint at this price point.  4.  The price.  While we dined on the restaurant week special, I took note of the main menu.  Prices are easily inflated 10-20% over what similarly priced/quality food would be at other PGH locations and a $12 Captain Morgan mixed cocktail...  Really?  While i was glad we tried it, I had wanted to use this as a special occasion joint Instead, I'll likely be looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"This entire establishment is first class from the moment you step out of your car. Service is top notch and while the restaurant is very busy, you'll feel as though you're the very important guest in the room.   I chose the cauliflower steak for dinner and before you eye roll me - wait. Altius absolutely nailed it and if you can imagine that much detail being given to vegetable based dishes, imagine what they are doing to your steak. I'm not sure what is more beautiful...the view or the dreams I've had of my dinner ever since.    You'll be treated to a tasting of popcorn at your table. I didn't even know I liked (ok...love) truffle popcorn, but I do. I'm now obsessed with it and you will be too.   Only visit Altius if you want a dinner experience that will delight you and a truffle popcorn obsession to follow."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fabulous! Nathan was an excellent server, he made great suggestions and was very attentive. We had perfect Ribeye's, filets, sea bass. The steaks were cooked to perfection. The beet appetizer was wonderful along with delicious desserts and wine choices.  This is a great place to enjoy a fantastic top notch dinner with an excellent view of our beautiful city!  The fireworks were an added bonus."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary dinner.  I was not impressed with the service (especially for a fine dining restaurant).  I felt the server was quick with us, that he was insincere.  Being a server myself, I am familiar with some of the trends in the industry -- my feeling was perhaps this server saw two young people and decided we were not a worthwhile investment?  I certainly could be wrong, maybe he was having an off night.  Also noticed he might have had a number of tables?  I ordered the pork chop, my date ordered filet.  The food was very good but would not return in a hurry."}
{"text":"Delicious and high end. The view of all of pittsburgh is amazing. Food is extremely filling. Got the duck. Meat was both quality and cooked well. Chocolate dessert was good, although not excellent as there could've been more layered flavors or a lighter texture."}
{"text":"Altius is astounding.  We went here for a celebration on a cool day in March.  The sun was shining and with the entire side of the building made of windows, there wasn't a bad seat in the house.  Pittsburgh was on display!  The staff was friendly and incredibly helpful in deciding options.  I ordered the Salmon and I still dream about it.  I suggest Altius for a special night out, either with family, friends, or a significant other.  If you want to feel high-class, go to Altius."}
{"text":"WOW!  WOW!  WOW! Restaurants seldom knock my socks off, but did I say wow?    Atmosphere:  A+++ Altius sits on a hill high above downtown Pittsburgh, so the view is amazing!  The evening was cool and clear when we visited, so the skyline was breathtaking.  Many buildings and bridges were already starting to light up and decorate for Christmas, so it was an added bonus.  The interior of the restaurant was nice.  I found the first floor to be a little loud and boisterous, but we were sat upstairs, which was a much better atmosphere.  Food:  A+++ We were given some dill seasoned popcorn to snack on.  It was so damn good that I really wish they hadn't brought it, as I proceeded to do my best to ruin my appetite with it. I started with the foie gras.  OMG!  It was delicious.  My boss had the beat salad.  It was delicious. For our entrees, I had the seared scallops, and she had the duck breast.  Both were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Service:  A+++ The service was top notch from the moment we walked in the door, until the moment we left.  Our waitress joked with us and really created a great rapport.  She was helpful in suggesting menu favorites, and explaining the dishes.  Value:  A Make no mistake...Altius is expensive.  For most, it would be a special occasion dinner. With drinks, we dropped $265 for the two of us.  With that being said, I wouldn't call it a bad value.  We got what we paid for, which was stellar food, beautiful atmosphere, and top notch service.  I have no problem paying for that; however, I was lucky that this treat was on the company dime.  Yay for out of town conferences."}
{"text":"One of the best fine dining restaurants not only in Pittsburgh but in any state. The food was amazing and the experience is just what you'd expect from a white table cloth restaurant, not to mention the view. If you eat on Mt. Washington this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My now-fiance took me here for my birthday dinner, after proposing to me, so this restaurant will always have a special place in my heart. He made the reservations months ahead of time to ensure we got a table next to the window. The view of the city lights at night is incomparable. Service is friendly and knowledgeable. They have a great assortment of breads and cheeses to start. I had fish, perfectly crispy on the outside and melted in my mouth. They brought out a mini cake for us as well since it was my birthday, and even gave us small desserts to take home for free!"}
{"text":"We spent an evening at Altius to celebrate a College Graduation. The service was impeccable from both the planning stage until we left that evening. The staff assisted us with placing gifts in our car, so we could take pictures at the observatory deck which is adjacent on Mt. Washington. That is just one example of the attention to detail which was displayed. For starters the Charcuterie was absolutely amazing! Our guests ordered the Pork chops, steak, & chicken dishes and everyone gave positive feedback. The rest of us ordered the salmon dish which was absolutely amazing! The Pastry Chef prepared a custom cake for the event and it was not only a work of art, it was delicious. Portion size was plentiful which is something usually lacking in a high end restaurant, so everyone was pleased with that as well.  Breath taking views of the city, modern upscale dining atmosphere & delicious entree's with outstanding service sum up our experience at Altius.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous view! The service was outstanding. Love the popcorn before the meal. The food was good. Oysters and Sea Bass were very good, but the Duck was over cooked. We would definitely go again and try something different."}
{"text":"Hopefully nobody runs into trouble with the management here (or lack thereof).   Also, don't get any of the meats -- unless you want food poisoning.   At least the view is nice."}
{"text":"We went recently to celebrate our engagement. The food was good, but that was about it. We weren't totally blown away. You definitely pay for the view, which is absolutely breathtaking and made for a wonderful evening. Not sure if we will be back, but it was definitely a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great place to celebrate an occasion or just take in the view of downtown Pittsburgh! Delicious food and even better service!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars, but rounding up to 5 stars! A group of us made a reservation at Altius to celebrate a special event after hearing all the good things about this restaurant from a friend of ours. All of us aren't from Pittsburgh, so it's definitely a plus for a restaurant to be just a few steps away from another Pittsburgh's tourist spot like Duquesne Incline as well! The restaurant is also a popular spot, so make sure you make a reservation ahead of time. We were lucky to even snatch a table next to a window for early dinner, but even then our reservation was made a few months in advance.  All of us ordered different dishes (I ordered duck breast) and, frankly, I was super happy with my food that I literally cleaned my plate (nothing left on my dish at all!). The duck done so perfectly that the skin was crisp but the meat still tender and it went well with the puree/vegetables (including an edible flower) that came with the dish. Best of all, the meat didn't smell or had awkward chewiness to it at all. I also tried other people's ribeye and lamb rack and thought the plate presentation was great and meats were cooked well (although I think the ribeye was slightly more towards medium vs. medium rare that we ordered). What I love also is that they have awesome complementary items such as fancy bread (to your choosing), complementary amuse-bouche (strawberry-pistachio mousse, house-flavored popcorn and truffle for you to try as well!  Overall, a nice, upscale dining (and if you scored a table next to the window, with an awesome view, too!). Definitely one of the top, top dining experiences in Pittsburgh (experience and price wise! :))...but worth it I think!"}
{"text":"I don't give many five star reviews, but there really isn't an alternate score for this place.  Let's start with the service, everyone is amazingly friendly and the touches are seen throughout, from the coat check, to how your water glass stays full, to how multiple people will ask you \"how was your first bite\" through each course.  The service was only rivaled by nice touches like a small,  complimentary, tasting item ( date filled with cheese wrapped in prosciutto), to the best popcorn I have ever tasted, brought to your table immediately, to the opportunity to choose from three types of bread throughout the night.  Thennnn the service was only rivaled by the taste of the food, I tried the charcuterie plate, the crab bisque, the house salad, the duck and the strawberry matza ( I needed to be thorough), and every item was delicious! The jam and honey on the charcuterie plate were literally the highlight of the appetizer. The bisque wasn't as hot as it should have been but I can't drop a whole star because of this when everything else was delicious. The house salad and whatever the dressing was... wow. Get the duck.... get it. I promise you'll thank me. It was to die for. The strawberry matza was delightful but I'll note they send you home with a free sweet treat soo may not be necessary.  The price is outlandish at first glance but for the type of experience you'll get here combined with the amazing view, it's worth it! Only thing I'd say to skip is the alcohol (unless you go for the wine) my friend and I both got cocktails and I'd say it wasn't this places forte butttt overall a great location for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at Altius a few days ago.  It was a really nice experience.  We did not get a table by the window, but we could still see some of the view and they gave us a nice curved booth, so we were happy and able to talk comfortably.   The food was very good, with properly sized portions.  I had the sea bass and my husband had rib eye. We started with crab toast.  The crab toast was so good I could've just made a meal out of that.  Service was provided by Lilah, and she was very good. Professional, but very personable. Pretentious waitstaff is  always unpleasant. Lilah was very friendly and made us feel welcome. She even offered to move us to a window at dessert, but we were fine.   I would be remiss if I did not mention the chocolate bourbon ball. My husband does not drink often. He ended his meal with this and it was lovely. We both said we could just sit at their bar and drink those.  All in all a great experience. We will probably be back at some point."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the 'burgh.   I just don't say this because I live on the same block. I say this because the place truly respects the value of a great dinning experience.   The view is spectacular.  The food is the best I have had in the city.  The service is rivaled by some of the best I've had in the county.  The staff make this a truly great experience. Before you have to have the conversation with the whole table about what appetizer should we order. They bring out an artisan popcorn of the week. Instantly the mood is lightened. If you have that one difficult person in your group that won't go along with everyone else's appetizer choice.... They can enjoy a little more popcorn.   The entrees are all great with sides to match. I haven't tried anything that hasn't deserved to be on the menu yet.   The desert is great too. If you are too full, often they will give you something sweet to take home with you for that late night snack.   This restaurant is nationally recognized as one of the top 100 in the country, and it is no wonder why it is there."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. I would go back and I always recommend others to Altius when they're looking for a nice place to eat. The way they set the dining room up, there's not a bad seat in the house. The food, I had the Penna. duck it was amazing. The desert was fabulous."}
{"text":"1. Just discovered that they shortchanged us. Invoice reads 2 Bisque, but none was ordered or served. 2. Calamari was good, would've been better if it was slightly less fried. 3. Agnolotti was great, Brussels Sprouts were charred to some extent. 4. Chicken was perfect. Great quality and well cooked. Generous portion. 5. Charcuterie was perfect, never had a better platter. 6. Risotto & Frites were too good  7. Bisque was never ordered, never served, but charged. $22.00 Chk 5136 6:22 PM / Nov 26/2016. Table B10/1 (We called them up, and they owned up their mistake and are sending a \"gift card\" for the amount, but for this shortchanging, they would have surely been at  4, too bad for them, this must go on record and it does, in its completeness)"}
{"text":"We had heard very good words for this new place on Mt. Washington and sine we were always looking for a place that could provide the great view with a good quality food we decided to give it a shot.  We were not disappointed at all!   The place is very elegant with a classy, modern ambiance.  The stuff is extremely helpful and the food is great as well! I love when restaurants offer bread with the mean and this one does (and the bread is great as well!).  The view is phenomenal.  We were lucky enough to sit right by the window and we could see the whole city.  I think Altius will be there for quiet some time since the combination of service, food and location makes it rather unique.  I will be definitely going back to try more of their menu.  It is also highly recommended for special occasions (e.g., first date, anniversaries etc.) :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and cocktails, great service, and an unbeatable view. This is a great addition to Grandview Ave. and I highly recommend to anyone and will return many times in the future."}
{"text":"Have you ever planned a special evening out and had really high expectations? I did and Altius met every single one of them.  I'm not kidding either, from the valet, hostess, bartender, assistant server, server, manager and the owner. Just a group of professional people there to make my night complete. They were helpful and the smiles were everywhere. I love that.  I need to first mention we sat right on the window on the second floor and that alone was worth the price of admission. Our city is stunning and it was a busy beautiful Saturday night.  The meal was awesome. They give you flavored popcorn to nibble on. Three types of homemade bread as well with this flavored butter and red fruity spread. No idea what it was but I could have ate a bucket of it. We had two appetizers a Sea Scallop/cornbread/pork belly w some type of vinaigrette. The other app was a Charcuterie of cured meats and cheeses. My words mean nothing! Look at those pics! The main courses were even better. I had the special of a Glazed peach Tuna w wasabi mashed potatoes and the wife had the Berkshire Pork Chop w a 4 cheese mashed potatoes and bacon wrapped asparagus. I blew it on the pic but it was better than mine. Honestly they were both 10's. :)   We finished up with a few deserts. We shared the chocolate mousse and the cheesecake. There was a raspberry ice cream with the cheesecake that I swear I have since dreamt about. All told this is a legit $150 meal for two if you are drinking. The beer and wine lists are too notch. I plan on going back and trying more items. Put Altius on your list for a must dinner. It is well worth it. :)"}
{"text":"The best restaurant I've ever been to! Visited for a special occasion at the end of January on a rainy Saturday night, and the view was still killer. The service was excellent and the restaurant itself is beautiful, classy, and modern. The entire meal was delicious, and unlike some fancy restaurants, we left feeling very full & satisfied. Pricey but absolutely worth every penny.  Our feast included: - Complimentary truffle popcorn (so good!) - Lobster bisque (amazing, served in a really neat way tableside) - Complimentary one-bite mini \"pancake\" with champagne cream and caviar (a nice treat) - Gourmet bread with honey butter & sun-dried tomato pesto (possibly the best part) - Duck and filet mignon (pretty good and fantastic, respectively) - Complimentary birthday chocolate truffles (lovely, though they did come after our waitress asked if we wanted dessert, and we thought the special occasion had been forgotten -- but it hadn't been!) - Complimentary chocolate chip cookie bars to go in cute little bags  Can't recommend this place enough. Make sure you dress appropriately, have money for the valet, and make a reservation! The Duquesne Incline is right next door too, definitely worth checking out after your meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary here at Altius. Everything and everyone was outstanding. The view, normally the star in restaurants on Grandview Avenue, was secondary to the dinner. Expensive, but worth every penny and then some.  I think we found our new special occasion restaurant! We will be back."}
{"text":"This fine dining experience continues to amaze us. The food is just beyond excellent. We arrived at 5 when they opened and Patti the hostess gave us a choice of which level we wanted to dine. She was very personable and accommodating. Jackie was our waitress who was superb. Very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. The drinks are very creative. The chef prepared a strawberry mint sample appetizer, along with gourmet flavored popcorn. Three kinds of homemade bread with honey pinot noir butter. The lavender honey bread was incredible. Lump crabmeat baked on an oyster shell, and burratto appetizers were phenomenal.  I had parmasean pasta with shellfish. Delicious. My wife had the Salmon with pea risotto. She loved it. Chocolate Ball with hot caramel sauce was so good you wanted to not miss a drop. I had the strawberry rhubarb tart which was light and flavorful. You really will not find a better dining experience in Pittsburgh. Amazing view as well. I have eaten all over the world, and Altius ranks with the best anywhere."}
{"text":"It is T.H.E B.E.S.T restaurant in the burgh! No other place can beat this place. We had date nights there,  took family over, meet with friends and we even had our rehearsal dinner there. Not a single thing that I can complain about this place.  So, first, start with the atmosphere, as everybody knows, it is mt. Washington, beautiful view from every seat of the restaurant. Of course the best ones would be by the window. The decorations are simple and classy with little details. Just love it. Second, food! My favorite is the pork chops. It is nothing that you can see very often in other restaurants or even the grocery stores. It is huge but moist, well seasoned and flavorful. The purple mash potato-great! The vegetable-awesome! All of our friend and family that goes there with us, our first recommendation was always this pork chops! And everybody just loves it and couldn't say enough nice things about it. Everything else on the menu was great too. The lobster soup, the oysters, salad, bread and etc. never had a disappointment there. we haven't check everything off  the menu yet, we will keep going back!  The third, service! So places have good food but horrible service. That is a big factor that turns customer away. I always wonder, why would any owner/manager in the service  industry let that happen? Well, this is not one of the place like that. They have great services. They greet us nicely every time. The waiters and waitresses are very professional not only knows the menu very well, but also their training includes how to talk to customers, how to point them where is the bathroom and details like that. Make you feel very respected and joyful to spend time there. They always give out popcorn while wait for appetizers or entree. Send you back home with cookies or chocolate bars home.   So I am giving them all 5 stars to atmosphere, food and service. Loving it!! Worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"Went there for my 50th birthday.  Was greeted great and the service throughout was tops.  The bread is outstanding and so are the accompaniments.  We started off with the tartare and oysters.  The tartare was pretty bland and it could have used some help from an egg IMHO.  The oysters were really small, which is okay, but not worth getting because they were really nothing special.  I ordered the ribeye medium rare and my wife had Chanterelle Ravioli.  My ribeye was medium, but also unevenly cut, which made it varied.  My wife enjoyed her ravioli.  The server offered to take it back or exchange it, but I just don't feel comfortable doing that.  Of course for $56, maybe I should demand better.  It wasn't overly tender to be honest, so I probably should have gotten the lamb.  I had Brancatelli  wine with my meal and it was okay.  It probably could have sat out for an hour or so before drinking in this case.  Our server was kind enough to offer me a free desert and I had the peanut butter bar which was okay.  My wife had Creamsicle Crème Brulée which she liked.  The view was great of course.  This was the first night for the new menu.  I thought about not going, but we went anyway.  Not sure if I will return or not.  The restaurant is very nice inside and the staff is great, but I am a foodie and for $240 for two, I expect a pretty darn good meal.  I honestly didn't get it.  If you feel like steak, you may want to order a rare for med rare, but I am only one person, so you want to read more to see if it is a trend.  I hope this place does well and continues to improve.   There has never been a very good restaurant with a view up there before."}
{"text":"I've driven past Altius's location numerous times, including when it housed the now-defunct Georgetowne Inn, and I was intrigued at first sight.  Altius's exterior appearance is gorgeous... modern, clean, and inviting, all of which are reflected in the interior as well.  Upon entering the restaurant, I already knew we were in for a treat.  The lighting was low, the hostess was pleasant, and that view... do I really need to say much about it? You'd be hard pressed to find a better view of the city than from Mount Washington, and Altius is perfectly situated, providing panoramic views from the North Side to well past Oakland.  When my boyfriend & I arrived, the hostess said our table would be ready shortly and invited us to grab a drink at the bar, which we did.  The bartender was attentive, acknowledging us as soon as we sat down, and offered a wine list and cocktail menu.  After settling on a glass of Santa Duc Côtes-du-Rhône ($12) and an ice water, Lee and I enjoyed some quiet chitchat as we waited.  Within 5 minutes, the hostess was back to let us know our table was ready, and she offered to transfer my glass of wine to our dinner bill at the table (always a bonus point in my book).  A gentleman soon appeared with menus and directed us to our table in the lower dining area.  I was a tinge disappointed that we didn't get a seat right next to the window, but honestly there is not a bad seat in the house.  You can see everything from everywhere!  Our waiter quickly arrived and pointed out that all of their wines are selected and paired with particular menu dishes, and I was impressed that he took note of the wine I was drinking and offered to pair a menu item if I so desired.  We took a few moments to review the menu and ultimately settled on the charcuterie board ($14) as an appetizer, watercress salad ($9), the Duck Duck Goose for me ($32) and the Chilean Sea Bass for Lee ($36).  Prior to receiving the charcuterie board, our waiter brought out an amuse-bouche for each of us which is always a nice touch.  The charcuterie soon arrived and was one of the better ones I've had the experience of consuming.  There was just enough meat and cheese for us to split, the bread was grilled perfectly, and I'm still salivating over the stone ground beer mustard.   Another waiter stopped by with a dish of sundried tomato spread and butter and offered us fresh bread.  I highly recommend the rosemary foccacia -- outstanding.  When the main courses arrived, I knew we weren't going to be anything short of blown away.  The presentation alone was stunning, and after just one bite of the polenta that surrounded the duck & goose, I was hooked.  I don't even know if I can explain the flavors... they were just phenomenal.  The duck breast was seared to perfection and the rest of the dish came together perfectly.  At some point, I managed to sneak a bite of Lee's sea bass and lobster couscous -- WOW.  A few minutes later I was stuffed beyond belief and realized I'd have to throw in the cloth napkin and take the rest home.  My leftovers were promptly boxed up once we signaled that we were finished eating, and the waiter delivered the check and a house-made toffee bar for each of us to take home.  Nice little touch!  Altius is unlike anything else I've experienced in Pittsburgh and I would highly recommend it for a romantic dinner with your significant other or classy night out with friends.  It is a little on the expensive side, but the service and food are completely worth it."}
{"text":"Very good dinner! I had the gnocchi and my husband had the salmon. Both were excellent dishes. The prices were also very reasonable. Mine was only $22 and his was around $29. The interior is very sleek and trendy but the largest problem we had were the lights. The flicked from very bright to completely turned off very frequently. When I asked our waitress she said they are working on it and it's caused from the incline next door."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for a belated valentines dinner, and it was amazing! We had both been to Isabella's already and we're looking for a similar experience. We shared two appetizers: the steak tartare and the \"tongue n cheek.\" I was hesitant about the latter because I generally don't like beef tongue, but it was done so well. For entrees we had the sea bass and duck breast, both very good. Of course the experience was pricy, but we got a few complementary small plates and a brownie for dessert, and the food and atmosphere was well worth it. I think it was one of the better restaurants in its price range that I've tried so far."}
{"text":"Awesome view! High end cuisine with excellent choices! Wine list is smart but not overly extensive. Service was fantastic and I requested a window seat for our anniversary at the time  I made the reservation and they were happy to accommodate!  Great food and superb ambiance. It doesn't get much better than Altius for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"This place is simply lovely, and by far the best restaurant on Grandview Ave. Not only is the view of the city amazing but the food is also delicious, which can't be said about the other fine dining restaurants on the Mount that rely mainly on their location to bring in patrons.  We made reservations for a weekday night, and the dining room and bar were full much of the night. The host greeted us warmly at the door and led us to the sunken dining area. The decor is modern and comfortable, and the lighting is muted to allow the light from the city shine through the floor to ceiling windows.  Our service was outstanding. The meal starts with popcorn with an espresso dusting that was delicious. It's little things like this that set Altius apart. There was also an amuse-bouche. When I told the waiter all of my food allergies, they changed it completely for me. They also changed my main entree to address my restrictions. I had the chicken, which was moist and delicious. The side of potatoes was a nice addition. My boyfriend had the \"Duck-Duck-Goose,\" which he enjoyed but noted could have been plated differently so that the various flavors weren't lost.   The cocktails were okay, but not amazing. Next time we go we plan on sharing a bottle of wine from their extensive list.  This is a wonderful place for a romantic or celebratory dinner. I look forward to a second visit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh and one of my favorite restaurants, period.   But in a nutshell: Vibrant, beautiful, bold flavors that compliment an atmosphere decorated by an  interior that speaks trend and class with an experience higher than the mountain upon which it sits. Must try. Like today.  Name: Let's start with the name, I mean Altius. Beautiful. It means higher (think Olympic mantra citius, altius, forties - Faster, Higher, Stronger. This is not a Kanye West shout out. He irks me. I digress). Nestled cozy atop beautiful Mt. Washington, they couldn't have named this anything more appropriate.  Intro: Walking into Altius is brilliant. It does have this gravity defying look to it. I don't know if it's the colors or the overall atmosphere but the layout is perfect. Coming from a film background I can tell you it was beautifully designed and gives you this feeling of escalation. With the view of Mt. Washington at bay you really \"enjoy\" being at this restaurant. In fact, you savor it. Though modestly different, It reminds me, for some reason, one of my favorites in NYC, ABC Kitchen.  Service: Impeccable. Our server was super funny, friendly, professional and knew exactly what he was talking about it. This hits hard with me because it is a reflection of the chef and owners and I think this is important for such an upscale restaurant. The servers all work well with one another to ensure every t and I is crossed and dotted, respectively and that every glass is full and sparkling.  Food: Wow. Just wow. Never in Pittsburgh have I enjoyed every single piece of food I unwillingly gently placed in my mouth (unwillingly because I wanted to just scarf everything down indian food style eaten at home- hands and all).Let's start from the beginning. I am huge on presentation and they nailed it with everything.   The amuse bouche was delightful. It was a small crepe like concoction filled with a lime glazed filling sitting in a small custard. One of the most heavenly single bites I have ever had in Pittsburgh.  For starters we got the: Steak tartare (delicious, blended with this mustard seeds and this relish founded on capers - good lord the flavors were beautiful. The egg yolk gave it a gorgeous texture and the crostini upon which I parked this delicious meat was grilled perfectly with the right amount of crunch) Chicory Salad (fennel, burrata and figs - muito gostozo, muy delicioso, I mean everything from salad texture to flavors was perfect).  Main: Rack of Lamb:  The seasoning was sensational and the meat was cooked PERFECTLY. Every bite just melted in my mouth. I literally thought the lamb was a part of me, seriously, I almost starting Baa'ing, or whatever sound lambs make. If Mary had a little lamb, I'm taking it to Altius. One of the best lamb racks I've had, period. This chef knows what she is doing!  Strip Steak: First off, the choice of cut was perfect and you can tell they pick their meats meticulously. Cooked to perfection, just the perfect amount of mouth watering juiciness and redness. What I am about to say will make my Hindu ancestors cringe in their grave and curse with me horrible karma, but I like my plate to slightly moo when it comes out and this plate sang sweet nothings into my mouth.  Dessert: The \"Ball\" - a cake adorned with chocolate, hazelnut, caramel, and a freaking journey in your mouth through full throttle with turbos made out of extremely beautiful textures. If I could make a EDM song about this \"ball\" it would be Crunch, Melt, Moan, Repeat.   Minds out of the gutter people.  Anyhow, I wanted more and that's all I am going to say.  Overall,  My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It is my go to with my family and girlfriend and my recommendation for anyone who wants the fine dining experience in Pittsburgh. I think you get more than what you would anywhere else for the price (which to be honest, isn't even that bad). From start to finish Altius really does take you to culinary heights and I doubt anyone will be disappointed.   If you are, then you messed up. Yes, YOU."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very chic! Great location & beautiful views. The food is superb! Our meals came with many extras--house made fresh baked breads & dips, as well as an Amuse Bouche, compliments of the chef. We ordered the Charcuterie Platter--so good & creative, as we were able to make our own flavor combinations. We both ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with Lobster Cous-Cous. Delicious! Crispy outside but buttery soft inside. We had no room left for dessert, but they sent us home with blondies anyway. Felt so spoiled! Can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner with a group.  Service and food were excellent.  It was nice to see a refreshed restaurant on Mt Washington with modern fixtures and furnishings, but still getting the breathtaking view of the city.  This would be a great place to bring out of town guests for a special meal."}
{"text":"A bougie place with a really great view on Mount Washington. The food and service is fantastic as expected from a place like Altius.   Our food came with salt and vinegar popcorn as well as a bread service. They also provide a cookie as a parting desert.   All aspects of the main course were great. The carrots we're insane. I usually don't like them but these were soft and juicy. The gnocchi were also stupid good. And the meat was cooked to perfection.  You should expect to spend at the very minimum $50 per person."}
{"text":"Great experience all around! We decided to take a last minute trip to the city for our anniversary. I ordered the bass and the flavors were wonderful. I especially enjoyed the pea purée that complimented the fish. We were looking for somewhere with a nice view and were not disappointed. The charcuterie starter was a hit! Finished our dinner with the chocolate cremeux. It was VERY rich and we love the nice touch added for our anniversary. The service was the best I have had in awhile. Highly reccommend coming here for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Server was Autumn and she was exceptional. The food was the best we have ever had. Even the cocktails were remarkable."}
{"text":"Food: 3 Decor: 4.5 Ambiance: 5 Service: 5 Value: 4  Absolutely incredible views. Good food as well. The freebies were probably better than the actual meal though. And it gets expensive."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Went to Altius for our first time for our anniversary and it was great! We had great cocktails before dinner, the tongue and cheek appetizer (don't be scared of the unique meat, tasted like a filet). She had the porkchop which ended up being the best porkchop we've ever tasted and I had the duck, it was phenomenal. The chef sent complimentary small plates to the table throughout the meal and they were all amazing. I highly suggest Altius to anyone that knows good food!!!"}
{"text":"This place is phenominal!  A group of 6 of us had a reservation on the first Monday of restaurant week and couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the atmosphere, to the wait staff, to the food in general, and you can't forget the view. The interior design blows my mind thinking that it used to be the dingy/outdated Georgetown Inn. A very clean and inviting ambiance with comfortable seating and an upstairs.   The food... Was incredible. Not only is pricing decent outside of restaurant week menus, it's totally worth it for the quality. Our waiter was so fun and made the experience even better. When I went to take a picture out of the windows, the \"matitre d'\" of the place dimmed the lights as I was getting the *perfect* shot.  All in all, I would recommend Altius to anyone. Whether they're looking to spend a few hundred (which we still did), or just grab drinks and a few dishes to pass after work... This restaurant is SPOT on. Well done, all!"}
{"text":"For my money, Altius offers the best dining experience possible in Pittsburgh, emblematic of the city's beauty and vibrant culinary scene.   You absolutely can't beat the view, for starters. No matter where you're seated - they don't accept reservations for a window, sadly - the large windows offer wonderful panoramic vistas of the city's gorgeous skyline, rivers, and stadia.  The food was excellent, down to the multiple amuse-bouches offered prior to and after our meal. I had the Amish Chicken Breast, which positively dripped with wholesome, melt-in-mouth goodness. The spaetzle and greens played really well with the perfectly cooked chicken. My date had Chilean Sea Bass, with pappardelle, greens, and bacon bits, and described it as 'one of the best things I've ever eaten'. Our wine pairings - Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay respectively - were well picked by the excellent staff.  The best part? The restaurant brought out a little cherry Ring Pop to surprise my date with the delicious 'S'mores' dessert - a running gag between my date and I since our first ever conversation. They were so helpful and cooperative, and I couldn't have been happier at her gleeful surprise. They made me look wonderfully smooth! :)  All in all, an excellent experience, and well worth the price - a fraction of what you'd pay for views, food, and ambience like this in most any other city. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After 3 failed attempts (due to weather), we finally succeeded! Yay, us! This was my last week in Pittsburgh for work so we decided this was a must do before I depart. We made reservations via OpenTable and didn't have any difficulties. If you just want to drop by to grab drinks and some appetizers and had trouble getting a table through OpenTable,  I understand that you can eat at the bar area. I believe that's a first come, first service area. So here goes the review:  The view was absolutely breathtaking! 5* Service was excellent as you should expect at an upscale establishment as such. 5* Food- I had the Shrimp and Scallop bouillabaisse. It looked wonderful however, my risotto had something in it that made it so bitter and off putting. 4* My friend ordered the Salmon over mushroom risotto - this was the winning dish! Salmon was perfectly cooked (medium) 5* Drink -- Warhol (Stolichnaya Vodka, Pomegranate Liqueur, Hibiscus Syrup, Pineapple Juice, Egg White, Lemon Juice) Delicious - top 3 of my all time favorite craft drinks ever 5*  Most of the main courses are about $35, cocktails are about $12 and desserts about $10.  Come after 6pm, they offer valet for $6 or try to find street parking for free.  If you are in Pittsburgh for a short period - definitely give Altius a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to hear about this new place on Grandview Ave! The reviews, website, and menu sounded very promising, so we made a reservation for our Anniversary dinner Saturday 6/14/14.  We arrived for our 8:30 res., table not ready.  Annoying, but no big deal.  We had drinks at the bar & were seated about 9pm.  Our waitress arrived 15 min later to take drink orders(we were really ready to order dinner at this point). We did not have drink menu's, she insisted on bringing them. Awhile after we got our drinks, she returned, asked if we had questions. We said \"No, we're ready to order.\", she proceeded to tell us all about the dishes on the menu anyway. I ordered the Lamb rare, she made a big deal that the chef's would love that, because they had a terrible time getting it cooked properly(medium-rare), one lady had to send hers back twice, and it still didn't seem to be done properly the third time!  She returned about 10-15 min later with bread for us, another table just seated, and a third table that was finished & waiting for their check (very odd; the couple just shrugged at each other). We waited until just after 10pm, a table seated just before us was packing up their leftovers, and we were not feeling confident about whatever was going to come out of the kitchen...  At this point, more than 1 1/2 hrs past our reservation, still no appetizer(which was raw tuna, not time consuming), we asked to cancel our entrees and appetizer.  Our waitress brought the check within a couple of minutes with the appetizer she said she was \"just bringing it out\") packed up in a togo bag.  We paid and left.  When we got home, we opened up the Tuna Crudo...4 raw tuna medallions & accompaniments, 2 pieces of tuna had BLOOD VESSEL/VEIN CROSS SECTION in the raw tuna(not a little streak of blood, an actual blood vessel)!  Gross. Dangerous?  I'm not sure, but we were not about to find out.   Dissappointing & disturbing."}
{"text":"OHhh my god! Everything was spectacular. Went last night for a business dinner with a party of 13 and everything was perfect! The view is fab but the food and service topped it. Our server, Melissa, handled a large group like a field general with kid gloves. The food. Everything and I mean everything was perfect, not one negative comment from 13 people on anything (this group can be bitchy) not the water, the bread, the appetizers, entrees or desserts. The bread along with the garlic butter and tomato (?) spread were incredible. The fillet was perfect and the bacon, maple Brussels sprouts, well those aren't even vegetables at this point but soon good! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I want to start with the things I enjoyed the most about this place.   * Cocktails were presented well and flavorful.  * oysters and tuna app were tasty and fresh.  * lamb rack (despite $44 cost) was very tasty and flavorful.  * dessert was on point  NOW THE BAD!!!!  * A $35 CORKAGE FEE FOR A BOTTLE OF WINE  * Person seating and greeting (older blonde) was not courteous or welcoming.  * Wait staff was slow and discourteous. - I was continually bumped into time after time as the server taking care of the table behind me helped them. Never once saying excuse me or sorry. He acted as though I was a nuisance to him performing his job at another table. It was so thoroughly annoying and essentially ruined the great atmosphere they have. He really did bump me approx 10 times.   * as dinner was winding down and my lady and I were trying to enjoy our coffee and dessert in a romantic atmosphere with awesome views, THE STAFF DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO VACUUM THE FLOORS!!!! With a very loud sweeper. We had an 8:30 seating and it was only 10:05. Why seat someone at 8:30 if you want to start running the sweeper by 10pm so you can get home.    We will NEVER BE BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my folks anniversary. The entire staff were super friendly and the service was amazing, especially for having a party of 7. The food was wonderful. Had the beet salad for a starter, the lamb as my entree, and the wicked chocolate cake for dessert. Everything I had was wonderful and would order them all again. Everyone in our party was happy with their starters, entrees, and desserts.   I can't wait to return to try more of the menu. It was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to enjoy this place. It has a great view and the decor is really sleek and modern. We came for brunch and I feel like the consensus was that everything we ordered underperformed. I got a hash that wasn't very hash-like...it was more cubed than the typical mash-type hash you expect. The Brussel Sprouts in it were overly salted to the point where I couldn't eat them...I actually chose not to eat most of my plate as I really didn't want to force myself to eat something I wasn't really enjoying.   We got a shortbread topped with blueberries and a cinnamon roll as appetizers and they were both good. Other than that, it was a flop.  I'd like to give it a second chance and try their dinner menu because from other reviewers, it looks like they fair much better with their dinner selection."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars.  They are earned.  Nathan (our server) treated us like royalty and his recommendations were perfect.  The Sea Bass was perfectly seared.  I felt the price was very reasonable considering the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"Brought the boyfriend here for a fancy birthday dinner. As expected, an amazing restaurant that provides a wonderful dining experience! From the time I made the reservation to the moment we got back in our car after the meal, the service was phenomenal. The woman who took down my reservation answered all of my questions and made the restaurant policy clear in a very friendly way.   When we arrived, we were seated right away and provided with a cone of super tasty, truffle oil infused(?) popcorn, and a small sugar cone filled with salmon mousse from the chef. Service was quick, and our waiter, Jeff was very knowledgeable about the menu and specials. We started off with two (amazing) drinks and split a crab bisque starter. The bisque went very well with the bread service, as did the herb butter and sundried tomato that was provided with the fresh bread. For our main meal, I got the king salmon while boyfriend enjoyed the duck and a side of fries. Both dishes were delicious and generously portioned (my fears of having small-portioned-still-hungry-after-the-meal fancy food were squashed).   For dessert, I realized I hadn't spoken to the hostess nor the waiter regarding the birthday celebration. Over the phone, I had been told that for a birthday celebration, they are happy to write \"Happy Birthday ___\" and put a candle in whatever dessert we ordered, however I was nervous that since I hadn't spoken up about it while there, that it would be forgotten. Not only was it totally not forgotten, but they provided a complimentary separate chocolate lava cake-y dessert with the birthday message in addition to the s'mores dessert we ordered. Both desserts were delicious and a perfect end to the meal. The staff then provided us with chocolate truffles on the way out as well!  The only thing I would have wanted differently would have been a window table, but we still got a great view from where we were seated in the middle area, and they make it clear that they do not take requests for window seats (which I admit would be very difficult to accommodate..I imagine most diners would take a window seat if they could!). Waiter Jeff was very friendly and had fun with taking our photo in front of the window after the restaurant had cleared out a bit. I'll just take it as a sign that we need to keep returning for the window seat experience!"}
{"text":"It was such a nice experience! The sea bass is a must try and while I had high hopes for the duck duck goose, it was just alright. The pork chop was huge but didn't taste that good. Still all the other food we got was great, and there's the amazing view!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested Altius for the fourth of July. We made reservations weeks in advance but were not guaranteed a table against the windows. We actually ended up in the second row but the view was still incredible! If you remember Georgetown, you'll be blown away by the transformation. The inside is sleek and modern. It looks like a restaurant that would be located downtown.   For the holiday there was a five course menu for $85 a person. Amuse bouche, appetizer, salad/soup, entree and dessert. (I don't consider an amuse bouche an actual course seeing it's one bite. In this case it was a blueberry inside a raspberry with a brie sauce) Each course had 4+ options. I went with the charcuterie plate, salad, 10 oz filet and chocolate Panna cotta. The table was also served a choice of three breads. If given the choice, pick the foccacia as it was incredible. Each course was presented in a timely manner. I really enjoyed the filet though my cut was a little fatty (hubs filet was not). The presentation of each plate was gorgeous especially the desserts. Each course was very good and met my expectations. However, the highlight of the evening was easily the fireworks. Viewing the fireworks from the comfort of our table without having to deal with the Mt. Washington crowd was priceless. Overall, I would go back to Altius for a very good meal with an amazing view."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner after the in laws gave us a gift card.  Yes, the space is beautiful.  On the top of Mt. Washington, you can see the whole city from their massive windows.  The decor is understated and helps you to focus on THAT VIEW.  We were seated at a table right next to the windows on the upper level and immediately given a tasty little dish of coconut curry popcorn, which was hoovered right up by husband.  I thought this was a fun little wink: we're upscale but we don't take ourselves too seriously.  We started with a meat and cheese board, which was brilliantly curated and came with a truly remarkable bread selection.  Their cocktail menu is just the right amount of funky without being over the top.  I had the steak special and my husband had their fish of the day.  Both were wonderful: cooked perfectly, presented beautifully, and nicely accompanied by some standout sides. Service was, predictably, impeccable.  Y'all are doing this right: lovely space, delightful menu, well prepared food, and top notch service.  While this won't be an everyday restaurant (the $200 price tag for a meal for two was worth it but sadly not sustainable for us, the great unwashed), it's a wonderful place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"To update my last review, dinner last night was another 5* delight. Every aspect of the dining experience is as good as it gets. It starts with the valet parking, greeting, seating, watering and popcorning. The restaurant is sharp, clean, and modern without being cold or unwelcoming. The view is incomparable. The food was wonderful, consisting of a salad with heirloom tomatoes, bread service, and two outstanding fish dishes, a black cod and a black grouper. No room for desert, so I can't comment on that. It's pricy, of course, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment. We ate there this past Tuesday. Felt like a fool paying a $500 (including tip) check for five people. The rack if lamb was done perfectly and looked great, but lacked flavor. My brother had a $56 ribeye feature that was a total waste. It lacked flavor too. Texas Roadhouse serves a better steak for half the money. For that kind of money, you should leave there feeing like you can't wait to go again.  However, I'll never go back. We had $200 in gift cards. It was barley worth the $300 we had to add. Atmosphere and decor was nice...that's all!"}
{"text":"My mom and I dined at Altius last night to celebrate my last evening in Pittsburgh before moving away. I made a reservation earlier that day, and they were very clear that while they had us planned to sit at a window table, that of course it is never guaranteed. We were okay with that, since honestly the place is small enough with ample window sizes that you can see the view from every seat in there.  When we arrived, we were informed that our planned window table had just ordered dessert and coffee, so it may be another 15 minutes or so. They offered us a different table, but my mom and I were in no rush, so we decided to try a cocktail at the bar. Jim (the host/ maître d') was in constant communication with us, as was the manager, about the status of our table. Again, we had no agenda, so it was really great how accommodating they were for us!  As we sat at the bar, we talked about the decor and how modern, yet warm it was. My mom is a very traditional person, while I enjoy more modern decor, and she even enjoyed the fresh appearance. No, this restaurant does not have white table cloths and servers in tux vests/bow ties etc., but that's what makes it new and appealing to a younger crowd. Considering the guests in the restaurant that evening, they are doing a great job at attracting the younger crowd, yet still appealing to older generations too (my mom can't wait to bring my dad back there).   The speciality cocktail list was great. We tried the Katana, which is vodka, sake, muddled cucumber, and lime. It was very refreshing and not too sweet. The bartender was fabulous and we watched as she accommodated every request that came her way with ease (some requests were quite strange).   After maybe 30 minutes, we moved to our table. Since we were ten minutes early anyway, it really was only 20 minutes until we were sat at a window table. Like I said, THIS IS NO BIG DEAL! They were clear from the beginning that a window table is not a guarantee and were accommodating in making it happen even though you can see the view perfectly fine no matter where you sit.   My mom ordered the snapper, which came in a broth and she enjoyed it very much. I ordered the Duck Duck Goose, and it was suggested to order it medium rare, so I did. It came out perfectly medium rare and was insanely flavorful! I loved the kale it was paired with and the leg confit was amazing. The palenta was ample. I ate every last bite. Well worth the $32. My favorite part was the Parmesan Risotto, but I'm a sucker for cheese :p. We also enjoyed the pineapple upside dessert and chocolate mousse that was paired with peanut butter crumbles and this banana ice cream that I will dream about for the rest of my life!  The food overall was perfect. Perfect.   My mom and I had such a great time. We weren't rushed, yet checked on by our server just enough. Service was great and the food came out in an appropriate amount of time. Our server (didn't catch his name) made sure that everything was perfect and even accommodated our request to have a dessert to-go given to us at the very last moment. It was for my dad and included a sorbet, so our server didn't want the ice cream to melt while we sat.  I also can't say enough about Jim, the maître d. He really made the experience a 5 star one and even showed us the upstairs area after we had finished eating just because we asked what was up there.   When I move back to Pittsburgh, I can't wait to return and hopefully be able to treat my mom next time!"}
{"text":"ALTIUS is a panoramic restaurant on the top of Mount Washington, a large Hill looking over Pittsburgh. It's a very elegant place over two stories with 180* glass bays. Service is very good. The view is excellent, but over Pittsburgh of course.  The wine list is interesting and not too pricy. Appetizers are affordable but main course are really expensive ($40 to $56). Quality of that food ranges from average to good. Too ritch. Desserts way too sweet as sadly this is the case in most places in America where \"harmonious sugar balance\" seems not to have sinked yet. Clearly it's more a place I would recommend for the view than for the plates as it's good but no more than that."}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary, was perfection. Beautiful decor and view, gorgeous touches like popcorn at the table and amazing breads. Great wine. The pork I had was excellent. Couldn't have asked for more."}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant with impeccable food, service, and scenery. I've been to Altius twice and both visits were an all around A+ experience.  I was very satisfied with the sea bass and salmon entrées, the diverse bread selection, and generous appetizers. I also enjoyed how the chef sends a complimentary bite-size dish to each table shortly after placing your order.   The waitstaff, bartenders, and hostesses are very polite and eager to make the guest's experience comfortable. I highly recommend paying Altius a visit!"}
{"text":"I thought the view would be the pinnacle of the meal. How wrong I was! From start to finish, this could not have been a more perfect evening. We came at the right time - just before sunset, and had time to linger at the top of Mount Washington. We came a few minutes before our reservation and had time to mingle for a moment at the bar, which was well stocked and staffed, with a pleasant atmosphere. The maitre'd seated us on the second floor and by the window.  She started us off with a lovely bottle of french white wine from their well-curated collection. We enjoyed the she-crab soup to share, as well as the complimentary bread (they had warm, fresh gluten free bread for my dinner partner) and dill popcorn. The amuse bouche was a spectacular combination of goat cheese and fresh, flavorful peach. For our main course, my partner selected the duck, with a side of risotto, and I chose the vegetables and fresh ravioli. We elected not to order dessert this time (because we were stuffed), though the menu looked wonderful.   I could not have imagined a more perfect Pittsburgh location, more well-designed menu, or more lovely service. I was impressed start to finish, and we will absolutely be back. If you are going to spend this kind of money on dinner, make sure you are going somewhere with this much attention to detail. This would be the perfect spot to impress someone thoroughly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Romantic and modern space with panoramic views of the Pittsburgh skyline.  The crab toast and salmon were beautifully presented and tasted amazing.  It is pricey but worth it for the outstanding food, cocktails, and service!"}
{"text":"Altius is a modern upscale restaurant that sits on a hilltop in Pittsburgh.  The view from the windows offer great scenic views of the city at night. My party of 6 ended up being late due to travel delays and by the time we arrived the staff was more than accommodating.  From the host to the servers, all were courteous and provided exceptional service as one would expect at this caliber of a restaurant. We had the following: - Oysters on the half shell - very good and importantly fresh - Roasted Pork Spring Rolls - crispy and delicious - 14 oz Filet Mignon -perfectly prepared tender piece of filet with fresh veggies and potatoes on the side. Wonderful. - Citrus Chiffon - coconut panna cotta dessert that was rich and decadent.  Excellent.  I would definitely return when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday. It was an overall good experience.  I had made reservations a few days in advance and called and asked for a window table (told they could not guarantee it); however, we arrived 10 minutes early and they were able to clear a window table for us. We used the valet service for $6 upfront even though we live within walking distance (didn't want to be walking up those hills in nice clothes).  We started off with the charcuterie. It was yummy; however, most of the meats seemed to be saltier than other charcuterie I have had before.  I got the Lamb Rack and she got the chicken. The lamb was a little more towards medium than medium rare, and they did not cut the rack up into individual slices (had to get my hands messy cutting the rack apart myself). But it had good flavor. The risotto was good but I could only eat a portion of it because it was just so salty. The chicken was a slightly dry but the glaze (girlfriend asked for it to be on the side which was a good choice as it was delicious but concentrated) helped to add some moisture. The vegetables were fantastic.  We ended the meal with the Strawberry Pretzel Cake. OMG!!! Fantastic and a must try!  The cocktails were good but nothing to get overly excited about.  We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Everything you want in a special occasion.  The food, the view, the service, the presentation, the cocktails, all of it absolutely impeccable. I live in Los Angeles, and came here to Pitt wondering if it is true, that Pitt is the next big culinary destination. Altius proved it. The she crab bisque, prosciutto dates, beet terrine, the pork chop, the Amish chicken and my favorite, the sea bass-- all A+ dishes. What a stunner this spot is. And our waitress (brunette ponytail) was amazing."}
{"text":"TLDR: Food 5/5. Service 5/5. View 5/5.  My girlfriend and I went to Altius for our two year anniversary and it was honestly the best experience we've had in Pittsburgh. First off, the view, atmosphere, and service at the restaurant is worth 5 stars in itself. We sat by the window and we saw the whole city from our seats. I recommend looking up times for the sunset to see the city in all different lightings. It's also less crowded earlier (around 5:30).  As for the food, they started us off with popcorn with taco seasoning, which was surprisingly delicious, maybe cause we were starving. Then they served our drinks and this puffy pastry with prosciutto, mushrooms, and some cranberry sauce, which was compliments from the chef. Then they served us three types of bread, zucchini walnut bread, focaccia, and a plain Italian bread, with a chives and onion butter and sun dried tomato sauce. Everything was amazing...and FREE!   For our starters we got the calamari, which came with a arugula salad, and it was a great pairing. We also got the crab toast which was literally the best appetizer I have ever had and recommend to anyone who visits there. We got the pork chop and sea bass for our entrees, which we're not as good as the appetizers (maybe because we were so full), but still tasty nonetheless. The waiter told us that their pork chop would be the best pork chop we've ever had and it was true.  Overall the food is great, the service is awesome, and the view is unbeatable. Definitely worth the money to check it out, especially if it's someone's birthday since they give you free dessert."}
{"text":"There are no stars low enough for this place ..first of all we booked in advance , showed up and the place was not busy at all .  We saw a table next to the window empty and said we'd like that one   A bald man told us there was a window seat upstairs .....  So we went upstairs , we were a 2 top and we're sat next to a large group upstairs , it was awkward and noisy next to them . It smelled of low quality seafood in addition.   We told him we couldn't sit here .  We were standing downstairs and the hostess nor anybody placed us at a different table . We actually had to bring it up to them!  Absolutely horrible service , no professionalism!  We were told by the time we walked downstairs, another couple  came in and were  sat at the place that was empty and which we requested beforehand .  Discriminated much!   The table was completely empty when we entered , we requested it in fact, but the following couple was sat there for no reason whatsoever.  This is pathetic and an extreme faux pas !   The manager was summoned and he said we could wait 3o minutes for another window table.  No thanks .  What an insulting experience ......"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about Altius and the staff! I would like to give a shout out to CHAD...He was amazing! His attention to detail made my In laws ;50th anniversary dinner complete!! Thank you, Chad and Jeff!!"}
{"text":"I really would love to give the place 5 stars as I had high hopes and expectations before my first visit but unfortunately the experience was short of 5-star worthy. We arrived as a party of 5 just 5 minutes before our reservation time and checked in w/ the hostess. We then waited for 20 minutes by the door for a table to open up. I understand as a restaurant you can't go around asking guests to leave because other people are showing up and Altius being Altius can afford to slightly book tables closer together because people that made reservations aren't likely to just give up (I mean we did wait for our table) but this simply is not what a 5-star/perfect dining experience should start off with and very disappointing.  Fortunately the night went better from the moment we sat down at the table, one that's almost the farthest from the window. We attempted to get switched to an empty table by the window but were kindly turned down by the manager for needing 5 chairs at a 4-person table. Fair enough.  The waitress brought up some popcorns to start off the night and honestly they were delicious if not just a bit too salty. After ordering we were also served some bread w/ dips and spreads. The rosemary focaccia was a favorite along with the sundried tomato dip. As for starters we ordered oysters, steamed duck buns, and calamari to share. The oysters were good, probably as good as they could be in Pittsburgh. Duck meat in the buns was seasoned very well and that dish was the most popular app at the table. Calamari was a let down and let the arugula salad that came on the side steal the show. Finally for entrees the table had duck breast, mahi mahi, sea bass, and lamb chops. Maybe I just can't excited by fish these days but both mahi mahi and sea bass were good but not exceptional. Duck breast however was great, not surprising considering the steamed duck buns were awesome. I would consider the lamb chops to be the best out of these four main dishes, seasoned and cooked to perfection. As for dessert, panna cotta with mango jelly (?) was a great choice and the macarons were respectable.   Overall I wish they were better at timing the tables/reservations but I would probably be back again anyway. To maximize one's chance of being seated at a table by the window (at least in the space upstairs), go with a party of 4."}
{"text":"Considering I live on Mt. Washington, Altius was a MUST EAT AT on my list! My fiancé and I decided to wait for a special occasion, so we went on her birthday. Reservations were made, and we were seated at a beautiful table overlooking the city. Upon entering the building, everyone greeted her a Happy Birthday.  We were served coconut curry popcorn to start complements of the chef. Shortly after, we were served 3 choices of bread with a delicious spread. Our entrées that we ordered were the Australian rack of lamb and the pork chop! For dessert we ordered the Madeline lemon raspberry cake, and were given a free dessert for her birthday!  Overall, everything was delicious. I highly recommend the rack of lamb as it comes with succotash, fried feta and a delicious sauce. The pork chop was a little underwhelming only because everyone RAVES about it and it is considered their staple dish. I recommend Cashbah's pork chop over Altius, but that's not to say everything was not delicious.  The meal was very expensive, so this is only a place to come for special occasions."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eating here  for months, as we couldn't get a reservation last time we were in Pittsburgh, and it did not disappoint us. The service, the view and, most importantly, the food, were all outstanding."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Pittsburgh. The drink selection was amazing and the drinks were well prepared. Select charcuterie from appetizers and a drink of your choice and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"There are many good restaurants in Pittsburgh, but none have this quality of food AND the best view of the city.   Don't let its upscale menu scare you off; the staff here are friendly and very accommodating. I came here with my family at closing time--not realizing it was closing time--and they welcomed us for drinks after closing.   I've had dinner (salmon), several desserts, and cocktails here (the sazerac can't be beat), and all were worth the price. Plus, you'll sometimes get to see fireworks after a Pirates game!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place!  It is conveniently located right next to the incline overlooking the confluence of the three rivers in Pittsburgh. Great view of the football stadium and of downtown.   We started with some cocktails and the creative cocktail menu made it difficult to choose. I settled for an old-fashioned but made with tequila. It was incredible.   The menu also left us wanting to try almost everything. I ended up with the pork chop and again was completely satisfied.  The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing and myself and all of my colleagues enjoyed a fantastic dinner and will definitely return next time business brings us to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me for my birthday by making a reservation here. We live close by but had never been.   He called and asked for a table with a good view since it was my birthday. They saved the corner table on the second floor for us and the view was incredible! Truly one of the best views of the city I've ever seen.   Before I get into the food, the service was also incredible. My husband had noted it was my birthday a month ago when he made the reservation - and every staff person we encountered wished me a happy birthday. The hostess, manager, waitress... that level of service was exceptional.   My husband and I both ordered wine and got an order of pommes frittes which were delicious. They also bring you complimentary popcorn - it was maple butter flavored. It was delicious! I thought it was a an interesting offering that you don't see other places. They also brought around a selection of breads with this sundries tomato spread that was incredible.   My husband got the rib eye streak special which he loved. I ordered the jasmine rice which was very flavorful and unique. They made a mistake when keying my order in so I also got to try the vegan ravioli, which was also awesome.   We were planning on trying dessert because we heard it was so good, but we were so full that we decided to skip it. But then they surprised us by bringing me a complimentary dessert for my birthday! It was a chocolate cake - it was super rich (I'm not a huge chocolate fan), but still delicious.   Overall, it was a great experience and I have zero complaints. I look forward to coming back for another special occasion. The view is definitely the best part. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Boy, was I oblivious of how great Pittsburgh is! It was a short trip, nonetheless, well lived. They have so much to offer besides all the Steelers Fanatics!  If you are visiting, this review is for you. If you are a local, this review will make you proud. Now, I will say...I am Carolina Panthers Fan, but the boyfriend is a huge Patriots Fan....so I hope he doesn't read this, but can your Steelers please maintain the Super Bowl Record (it is a Tom Brady/deflated ball/ and the Carolina defeat in SB 2014 hate thing)?  Anyway, back to the restaurant and Incline....take the incline to Altius, it s a $5 round trip. It is a must do, take your time to absorb the reason why they exist and why there are only two left from seventeen. I truly appreciate maintaining a part of history with its integrity. As you walk out of the Incline station, Altius is to your right. Very short walk. I promise, I could have been eating a cup of noddles and been super happy. The views make you have that feeling, as you are basically overseeing the entire city, all three rivers, the stadium and the incline. Although Altius wins for location already, their food wasn't short. They live up to their name, high standards for sure. The food is great. Everyone enjoyed every bit of it. They have several caviar options and a great craft cocktail selection. The service was so professional. Our sever knew each dish in and out.   Cheers."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Duquesne Heights, I especially loved the awesome view of downtown. The decor was delightfully done and the food was excellent!  I had the Duck Steamed buns (very nice), Pennsylvania Duck Breast cooked to perfection and the Chocolate Cremeux which was delightful. I recommend them all.  Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the food, and the service was amazing. No complaints here! Best tiramisu I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner at Altius! I had the strip steak and it was delicious, perfectly cooked. Bf had the Chilean seabass which was featured that evening. He was not as pleased with his, unfortunately. But the service, ambiance, view (oh man that VIEW!) and other dishes were all spot on. I'm a wine lover, not big on cocktails, but I did order their \"purple rain\" cocktail and loved every sip!   This was definitely a special occasion restaurant for us, but I recommend Altius if you're looking for fine dining with a gorgeous view."}
{"text":"All the reviews I read seemed too good to be true,  it I was pleasantly wrong. The entire evening was a wonderful dining experience. The service was impeccable, the timing of each course was perfect and the food was excellent. We had the crab appetizer which was fabulous and  the duck and sea bass. Both were recommended by our server, who may have been one of the best I've ever met. We will be going back."}
{"text":"I live on Mt Washington and was so excited that someone came in and updated one of the \"run down\" buildings on Grandview!  (hopefully more will follow in the footsteps of Altius!)  We went on a double date to the restaurant on a Sunday night.  I made a dinner reservation and we got a lovely front view table.  Prob didnt need the reservation as the restaurant was not packed.  I love what they have done with the space.  It is a little modern and very classy!  Great for a date or romantic night out! Our server was great!  She was very friendly and let us take our time.  They bring you popcorn and artisan breads.  Yum!  The menu is a little different.  The food is very artsy and all the presentations are wonderful!  I had the beet terrine and it was interesting for sure.  Very tasty, with sweet and sour tastes and a little rich from the cheese.  I liked it a lot.  I also tried the Salmon with lobster for dinner.  It was fine, very well cooked and great presentation.....but, it wasnt \"mind blowing.\"  I thought everything was good, but not amazing.  I am very glad I tried it, as the view is amazing, but for the price I probably wont go back.   Wine=very over priced! No one at our table got a cocktail, maybe those were the way to go.....but the wine was expensive!  I would say I would give the restaurant 4 stars if they could offer nice wines without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"Fine dining with a few. One of the best meals I have ever had and one I hope to have again. From start to finish no detail is overlooked. Flavour was perfect, not one thing to complain about! Loved it!  Tip: Reservation and always request a premier window seat."}
{"text":"What a great venue! Great pairings, interesting offerings and top notch service. We were a party of a dozen with a plan to celebrate a great convention and decided to visit a local restaurant togethr. Chef Jessica put together a great evening for us, the staff were very attentive and the food offerings had a wide variety. We even toasted the brussel sprouts!  Wine list was very nice with many good choices and not overly expensive for the expectations of the reataurant.  The view of downtown Pittsburgh and all three rivers is unsurpassed. The evening started with day light and as we progressed through the courses and night time came the lights of downtown livened the atmospere. With the attentive staff, very fine wine and excellent food, I had goose goose duck, it was a night to remember. Then as the cherry on the top of the evening, Chef Jessica came out and thanked us for sharing her dream. What an honor and what an asset for Pittsburgh.  With a parting gift of a most tasty triple fudge browny we were off, satisfied and happy to have shared at such a nice place."}
{"text":"I had the dry aged ribeye special. With out a doubt best steak I've had in Pittsburgh. Can't beat the view, can't beat the service, and can't beat the food! Favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Great food with a great view! This was my first time here and the food was amazing. Everyone who worked there that spoked to use was very nice. The food is a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I honestly hadn't heard of this place until I went on open table looking to make anniversary reservations.  Guess I've fallen off the foodie scene.   Anyhow, as a Bistro 19 fan, this place did not disappoint.  Of course, the view was amazing and probably worth going just for a drink.  The decor was modern and lovely as well.  A tiny bit tight on space, but not uncomfortably so.   (Side note:  you could easily get seated in the bar area when we arrived at 5:15 and again.  Around 6:30-45, it was completely empty again... This was Saturday night.  So, if you're planning to stop by without a reservation and stay in the bar, it looks like if you do it either early or in the middle of the dinner hour, you're solid.)    Speaking of drinks, they were fantastic.  Huz had the East India and I had a French 75.   We also had the charcuterie, which the husband raved about and he rarely raves.  I was stunned as he kept shoveling meat and cheese into his mouth.  Typically, I end up eating these sorts of plates by myself while he rants about how the restaurant thinks it's fancy...   The popcorn was truffle flavor.... I don't really care for popcorn, but managed to eat most of it.... Delish and a fun touch.  I also have no idea what they added to the butter ... salt and a seasoning... it was like crack butter....  For dinner, I had the goose goose duck, which was truly outstanding.  I ate all of it.  And I rarely eat meat.  He had the steak, which didn't do much for me (I'm not much of a steak eater), but he thought it was perfect.  And it was beautifully cooked.  For dessert, we had chocolate cheesecake.  He thought it was amazing.  Again, not really my thing (or maybe I was just too full?), but tasty enough.  The marinated cherries on the plate were my fave.  Actually, I'd have eaten the cherries and the ice cream alone...  And they sent us with a delightful little fruit cookie bar thing, so we really didn't need to order dessert.  I also had a glass of delish zinfandel (with the duck) and a cappuccino (with dessert).  He had a sparkling water with dinner.  Total bill before tip was around $150.  Completely worth it.  Easily the best meal we've had in ages.  And, frankly, if you had a single drink, still water, and skipped dessert, you could be close to the 50 pp mark.  (Entrees were in the $30 ball park and certainly enough for a meal... )  But, if you're going to splurge, why not?!  As noted by some of the other reviews, unlike a lot of fine dining places, the portions were very generous.  Service was also near perfect.  The server was prompt, polite and helpful.  The sommelier was appropriately present and helpful.  We thought about a bottle and he didn't bat an eyelash when I decided upon just a glass.  The wine list was nicely comprehensive -- a little bit for everyone at a good range of prices.    If you've got a special night out coming up, this is the place.  Hands down.  In the meantime, it gave me a hankering for a night just up the street at Bistro 19!"}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and only 2 nights. This restaurant is amazing and the view is spectacular."}
{"text":"The food was good.  The service was impeccable.  The view was as good as it gets for Pittsburgh.  Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.  But nothing was unique or unexpected.  The menu was strip steak and salmon and potatoes.  This is a place you take your parents when they visit where they're guaranteed to go apeshit for the complementary amuse bouche and the window seat.  It's classic, it's uncomplicated, it doesn't imagine.  My fiancee and I had a lateish reservation on a Friday night.  We had the SEA SCALLOPS, BEET TERRINE, PENNSYLVANIA DUCK BREAST, and ASPARAGUS for the table.  The scallops were my favorite, because they are scallops, and scallops are delicious, and the kitchen managed not to ruin them.  The beet terrine was the most interesting dish, but don't order it if you don't like vinegar--it definitely has a strong sour kick.  The honey lavender glaze on the duck breast tasted like a play on Peking duck, and the accompanying grits were cheesy and satisfying while the multicolored carrots were soft and mildly sweet.  The asparagus tasted like asparagus.  Cooked.  We were also offered two types of bread (a honey wheat and a parmesan) with tomato pesto and herbed butter, as well as truffle-flavored popcorn and tiny ice cream cone of smoked salmon cream cheese.  I ordered an Earl Grey tea, and it came with the world's cutest metal milk carton-shaped pitcher of cream.  They sent us home with to-go bags of complementary chocolate cake bites.  I guess what I'm getting at is, for me, Altius is the definitely of \"A-OK.\"  I can definitely see the appeal--it's just not my favorite way to rack up a food bill.  But if you're looking for a $50 steak with a view, look no further."}
{"text":"We live in Miami and always come to Altius when we are in Pittsburgh visiting friends. This was our worst experience so far. The hostess was rude and was making comments and faces after we didnt like the table she showed us (we specifically requested a table by the window and this was not it). Their drinks are good but I have a feeling they got worse with the food. I like their crab toasts but I was very disappointed with their lobster ravioli (they were cold and had the smallest piece of lobster meat ever). For the main I had fish of the day and wasn't impressed either- if I ever go next time (its still one of the best restaurants in Pitt), I'll just order one their menu items, because the specials are just not special."}
{"text":"Hate to give this review so late. The atmosphere was absolutely amazing and our waiter was superb. But the lamb was over cooked and my husbands pork was burnt .. we just aren't the type of customers to say anything in person. Better to just write a quick review. The salmon wasn't anything to rave about according to my son and dessert was meh. I wouldn't pay 500 bucks again for this for our entire family. The only 5 stars goes to the steaks and potatoes that my little girls split. Maybe again another time. But this trip only gets 2 stars. Just for the service and the ambiance."}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of the Mt Washington \"fine dining\" scene. Overpriced mediocre food with the hopes of a view of the city. Altius, however, was everything you could want in a meal with the added bonus of a fantastic view from any table in the house.  My boyfriend and I decided to give it a try for Valentines Day based on the previews reviews and the fact that they had a four course (and then some- which I'll get to below) prix fixe menu for $85 a person- not too bad on a day restaurants can basically charge whatever they want.  As soon as we were seated we were given a tasty bite of the truffle popcorn many other reviewers have mentioned and it did not disappoint! I was pleased to see that the prix fixe menu offered at least four options per course (more for some) and all sounded delicious. We ordered a bottle of wine and began the great menu draft of VDay dinner 2015. With so many delicious options we didn't want to order any of the same items, so we went through course by course carefully planning our winning teams. I ended up going with the tuna poke, baby kale salad with butternut squash and smoked bacon dressing, roasted lamb- crusted in mint & served with whole grain mustard sauce/berry compote/green beans/& leek mash, and the \"half baked\" brownie with cherries and salted caramel sauce. My boyfriend went with the oysters with Tabasco pearls (fun!), watercress salad with brie en croute and light vinaigrette, ribeye and jumbo gulf shrimp served with some delicious tomato horseradish aioli thing along with green beans and potatoes, and a mango/berry chocolate almond bomb. Phew, that was a lot to remember.  While we both felt like mine was the winning menu (arms up in victory!), both meals were prepared perfectly and incredibly delicious. The lamb and steak were a perfect medium rare and all the flavors combined to make the perfect bites. In addition to the ridiculous amount of food listed above (all generous portions) we also received an amuse bouche of an edible spoon with chocolate/orange marscapone/strawberry on top, and homemade parker house rolls with seasoned butter and roasted red pepper pesto.  Everything about the food was impeccable and even sitting at a table away from the windows we still had a nice view. My only two (very small) gripes were that while the wine was delicious, the cheapest bottle of red was $48. It couldn't hurt to add in one or two options in the $30-40 range. Also, the chairs are a mod style and, while comfortable, did not serve much in the way of a coat rack. I believe there was a coat check but neither of the two hostesses or the maître d who sat us offered it. All in all a great meal and we will definitely be back to try the regular dinner menu and/or the brunch!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my birthday, but because I was busy, I had to reschedule the dinner for nine days later. The restaurant still wished me a happy birthday. We ordered the duck-steamed buns, steak tartare, lamb rack, salmon with horseradish, apple tart, two non-alcoholic fruity beverages, and sparkling water. We enjoyed the taste of all of the food. The waitress was smiley and promptly served us. They gave me a free birthday brownie as well as a different type of brownie to take home. Other extra foods included in the price were ranch popcorn and breads. Our table was not right up against the windows, but we still had a lovely view of downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, delicious food, wonderful service, and lots of mini special touches along the way.  We visited for our Valentine's Dinner.  We arrived a little early so sat at the bar and had a couple of specialty drinks.  We were able to be seated on the 2nd floor by the window.  The fog rolled in so think from a rainy February day that we didn't have ANY view - but no fault of the restaurant.    I can't say enough good things.  The only con - Valet parking - but this is pretty commonplace in the Mt. Washington area.  Decor was sleep and modern - very clean and comfortable.  We enjoyed a filet and ribeye t bone steak with no complaints.  Sides were delicious and included mixed vegetables, purple mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts.  Seasoning and dressing was perfect.  We opted for the charcuterie board for an appetizer - it was perfect. We were also offered bread with sun dried tomato or a honey butter. The first item we devoured was a special bite from the chef- a stuffed mini cone pastry.  It was yum!  We got to leave with a black little bag for each of us that included a chocolate chip square.  Also delicious for the next day. We were both very full and could not finish our dinner - so we took that to go.  I would definitely recommend this for a special occasion.  Plan to spend around $200 for two people. That includes tips and about 4 drinks."}
{"text":"Wow.... I've seriously never been treated so well by a restaurant in my life. Every single staff member, before we came, learned our names and that only ME (and called me by my name w/o giving it) had celiac disease and made EVERYTHING on the menu work for me. This place is all class and we had our anniversary there, and because my girlfriend's steak was not cooked to her liking (they did though cook it right eventually), the manager came out at the end to apologize and said \"the meal is on me and we would like to give you both a free desert of your liking, we again apologize\". This was a $200 + meal. I will always be a loyal customer to these folks."}
{"text":"Altius is among the finest restaurants I've been to, anywhere in the U.S. or elsewhere.  The service is excellent. The staff knows when to help and when to hang back.  The food is excellent from starter to salad to bisque to entree to dessert to espresso.  The wine list leans high. There are good options in the 40s but that's a high entry level.  Attention is paid to everything presented on the table, and there are vegetarian choices.  The cauliflower steak is the best I've ever had. Meat-eaters should try it.  The meal we enjoyed would have been spectacular if it were served in a basement. Instead, we had a window seat overlooking Pittsburgh on a moody, foreboding evening. The perfect backdrop to a great meal."}
{"text":"Came here around 7pm and it was not too crowded. The environment was nice and the view was beautiful.   We had the oysters for a starter. My date got a tea and I got one of their specialty drinks. The oysters were fresh and the sauce pairings were nice, but they were quite small. Drinks were good also.  While we were waiting we were given freshly baked bread. There were three different flavors and it is unlimited.  For our entrees we got the duck breast and the king salmon. I recommend getting both of them medium rare. They were delicious and the presentation was excellent.  At the end we got the mint chocolate cake dessert which was really cute and delicious. The chocolate was not too sweet and we'll made.  Finally, we were given freshly made cake pieces at the end, free of charge, which were also very good.  It was pricey, but the experience, food, and service make it worth it!"}
{"text":"Altius served me my final dinner as a resident of Pittsburgh, and oh, what a meal it was!  Knowing that I wanted to enjoy my last dinner on Mt. Washington at a restaurant with a view, I decided on Altius due to its sterling reputation for excellent food and service.  I made a reservation about a week ahead of time and was able to get one prior to 6pm last Fri.  A good friend accompanied me to share the experience, and both of us were quite impressed, to say the least.  The meal began with a cone of buttered popcorn, which seemed particularly apropos in light of the breathtaking theater-esque view offered by the restaurant.  Next, we were offered a choice of three types of bread--sunflower seed topped rolls, orange-infused bread, or salted rosemary focaccia--which we could pair with butter or sun-dried tomato pesto.  As the final opener, my dining partner and I were each offered an amuse-bouche, a tiny savory cone filled with salmon-infused whipped cream cheese topped with chives.  All of these appetizers were delightful in their own way and prepared us well for the meal that followed.  As our appetizer, we split the fresh strawberries appetizer ($14), a sweet-savory play on strawberry shortcake.  It consisted of a savory shortcake-like bread base with prosciutto on top, which in turn was topped with the eponymous strawberries, seasoned mascarpone cheese, honeycomb, and pea shoots.  It was surrounded by a drizzle of balsamic reduction, which served as a rich dipping sauce.  The overall effect, as the name suggests, was light, refreshing, and delectable.  For the most part, the sweet-salty balance was on point--the only part that tipped it a bit too much in the direction of sweetness was the honeycomb crown.  For my entree, I opted for the nightly special, which was pan-seared halibut ($42).  It was served over asparagus spears and a bed of whole grain mustard-infused risotto, and was topped with pea shoots.  Additionally, it was surrounded by a drizzle of honey mustard sauce, which, like the balsamic reduction, served as a flavorful dipping sauce.  The fish was perfectly cooked--it had a crisp exterior and an interior that was firm yet flaked apart readily under a bit of pressure from the side of my fork.  The flavors and textures of the asparagus and mustard-infused risotto complemented it well, and the honey mustard dipping sauce added a bit of moistness and extra depth to the delicately flavored fish.  It was definitely one of the most delicious dishes that I've tried at a fine dining restaurant anywhere in Pittsburgh, and I enjoyed every last bite of it.  As others have mentioned, the aspect that sets Altius apart from its competition is the exceptional service.  During the course of our meal, our waitress was courteous, professional, and unobtrusive, describing dishes and making recommendations when requested and checking with us to ensure that everything was prepared to our enjoyment.  The meal included several unexpected yet delightful touches, including the aforementioned appetizers as well as a miniature dessert delivered with the check.  The decor was tasteful and restrained, allowing our attention to be focused on the main features of the evening--the food and the view.  Although our table wasn't situated directly against the windows, it offered a panoramic view of the city skyline that was truly stunning, serving as a flawless background for our experience.  Needless to say, Altius met--and exceeded--my expectations.  It was the perfect setting for my last meal in Pittsburgh, and the quality of the food and service matched the beauty of the setting.  While the price point was a bit high even for a fine dining establishment, it was justified by the experience.  If you're seeking an outstanding location for a special dining occasion, I highly recommend it--it's the classiest restaurant I visited during my five years living in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD GOOOOOOOOOD FOOD!  Man this place is exactly why it excites me to see Pittsburgh grow as both a commmunity as well as a an up and coming city. No wait it is THE city to live. With all the new restaurants this one exemplifies why it is the place to live.  Me and my gf went here during restaurant week. We had both the duck and fish cheek appetizer, the chicken stew and poached salmon, and apple crumble and peanut butter ice cream desert. Sooo good. Nothing to complain about. Everything was perfectly cooked.  They obviously brought out bread and a tasting dish. Everything you would require from a 5 star restaurant. But in pittsburgh. The wines we tasted were also complementary of the meal.   The one thing that did bother me was those damn lights!! Haha they said the incline are connected on the same power grid which dims the lights everytime the incline starts. So weird when your talking and every 2 minutes the lights dim for a couple seconds.  Otherwise this is a great place for a date or even to get some nice drinks. This is the place you bring your parents when they visit or just to enjoy the view.   Pricey? Yes. But well worth the money."}
{"text":"Amazing food, beautiful view, superb service, excellent wine / entree pairings, a varied and delicious menu that changes every time you attend, and an elegant atmosphere on top of it all. I've been here twice and as long as they're open it'll always been on my short list of places to go for special occasions. It's expensive, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Amazing city views right next to Duquesne Incline, great customer service, but high prices and food quality was good but not amazing for the price point.  The chefs taste was ok with a small salmon en croute but should have been on a toast not a cone.  Had the shrimp special and the risotto was wonderful but the shrimp were way too salty. And at $44 that was about $10 too high.  Also $15 for 5 oysters is rather steep considering they were very tiny, but good quality.  Overall, I would try it again but I would study the menu ahead of time and order something that justifies $40+ an entree.  I don't mind paying the price but it better knock my socks off to justify paying that amount."}
{"text":"In spite of all the high ratings our experience proved to us what we suspected would be the case, which is Altius is a destination for patrons who have \"the view\" priority over anything else. All the other aspects of dining here failed miserably.  AMBIANCE: cold in both points - interior design and temperature of the room (I believe it was about 65 with vents blowing cold air constantly). The only + (again) was \"the view\" which you could enjoy from the Duquesne Incline viewing point for free.  FOOD:  \"wanna be\" creative and interesting but doesn't deliver in taste department and definitely overpriced. SERVICE: very \"nice and trying\", but slooooow (dinner took almost 3 hours) and not professional.  VALUE:  beyond overpriced. Definitely no return for us."}
{"text":"Best Chilean sea bass ever.  Apple Tart Dessert excellent and our server Maria was excellent."}
{"text":"I am giving a 3-star mostly because the service of the restaurant is very nice; however, the food, at least for a vegetarian, is very disappointing. There is only one vegetarian option and that is Cauliflower steak over Cauliflower puree with Cauliflower pickles. A very unexciting, boring dish even for me who like Cauliflower a lot.  Not only lacked any combination of vegetables, it also lacked any flavors. And then this dish costs over $20.  So, if I ever go back again here, which would only will be because of the nice ambiance, view, and service, it will definitely be only for drinks and not ever for food again."}
{"text":"Listen, Listen, Listen..... I took my fiancé here while on her birthday get away trip. I got the Salmon over a bed of shrimp and grits, while she got the steak with mash. I am a Salmon lover! This was literally the best Salmon dish I've ever had and I've eaten at many many many fine dining restaurants. I mean, just a perfect combination! I had a taste of my fiancés steak and it was like butter. I literally never knew a steak could be the texture that this steak was.   The ambience is fantastic (Very intimate and cozy) and the view is just breath taking. Service was also fabulous. I'd suggest using the valet service and skip trying to find parking on the hilly and narrow streets!  I can't wait to get back to this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and view. Normally, I dismiss restaurants with a view because they the food becomes a 2nd priority. Not at Altius. Nice start with breakfast sausage popcorn followed by a salmon ice cream cone amuse bouche. I ordered the she crab soup (bit too salty) and the Australian lamb chops with sweetbreads and roasted winter vegetables. Amazing dish. Lamb was perfectly cooked and sweetbreads were a nice touch. Highly recommend Altius."}
{"text":"What a find! Friends were coming to town and was deciding where to take these foodies. The view was stunning of downtown and we got a window seat. We started with charcuterie and reminisced about the good old college days. My husband got the pork chop, which was really juicy and tender. Delicious pork chop at a restaurant is definitely a positive sign of a must-eat restaurant. I went with the halibut and loved it. Will certainly come back with more friends."}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food is overpriced for what you get.  I got the duck and usually duck is succulent and tender.  This was like eating grizzle."}
{"text":"Excellent! Came here to have dinner with my boyfriend to celebrate my birthday. We've been to top-rated, expensive restaurants in Pittsburgh before, but some of them haven't lived up to the hype. This was not the case with Altius.  Just picture yourself dining in front of a breathtaking view while having some equally breathtaking plates. I'd suggest coming right before sunset - you can see the sky and the river change colors as you devour the delicious complimentary popcorn. The popcorn by itself was enough to justify coming here, but all the starters and entrees were also divine. The plates were more on the expensive side, and you do have to dress up to be let in, but overall this is worth it if you're celebrating a special occasion or are trying to impress someone .  Get the: She Crab Bisque (5/5) and the Pennsylvania Duck Breast (5/5). To die for."}
{"text":"I've had one exceptional experience after another at Altius. The menu is creative (without straying into weird territory), each dish is well-prepared and attractively presented, and most importantly - absolutely delicious. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable the food, and the atmosphere is upscale but not stuffy in the least. This is one of my \"go to\" places for special occasions and celebrations, and I only wish I had more excuses to come more often."}
{"text":"Came here on Wednesday and Friday for dinner. (What can I say, it was a big week)!   On Wednesday, it was absolutely amazing! I had the Pennsylvania Amish Chicken, which comes with surprisingly delicious blue mashed potatoes. The chicken was tender and juicy and flavorful and delicious.   On that day, I sat downstairs. The view was breathtaking. Absolutely breathtaking.   Service was also good. The server was well-informed, patient, and attentive. I couldn't wait to come back!   On Friday, we called late for a reservation and honestly, it was just 'eh. I had the ravioli, which actually tasted undercooked. It came with tomatoes of varied sizes and had a thin white sauce that I would classify as \"just ok.\" My fiancé ordered the duck and I don't think he was super impressed either.  That night we sat upstairs. The view is the same (plus a story), but the ambience wasn't as nice. I don't know why, but I didn't like it nearly as much.   Bottom line: Order the chicken, sit downstairs, and make reservations early!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 10 stars!  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, our entire evening was nothing but wonderful. Beautiful atmosphere, utmost of friendliness and professionalism from the servers, and exceedingly delicious food. At no point--not even when the power went out, and then a few minutes later when the fire alarm went off--did we feel there was anything really troublesome about the evening. In fact, we didn't even order and enjoy dessert until after the power went out, and we never felt rushed or worried. The situation was well out of the restaurant's control; I think we might have been experiencing an historic rain and thunderstorm weather event. Unbeknownst to me and my date until the minute we were asked to evacuate (calmly, pleasantly, and apologetically), a tree had taken power lines down in the neighborhood. The only thing out of the ordinary (besides dining in the dark) was that our the server brought an extra candle over to our table when she took our dessert order. Our dessert came out within minutes, we finished at our own pace, and then were so kindly and regretfully told we were going to have to evacuate because the sprinklers had gone off in the kitchen. I can't even imagine what the feeling was behind the scenes, but no upsetness was ever expressed to the patrons.  As for food, we started with the meat board and steak tartar, both were mind blowingly good. I had the scallops, cooked to buttery perfection with delicious spring vegetables on the side and my date had the pork chop, tender and smokey. We ended with the chocolate ball which was decadent and fantastic even without the melted caramel.  I think our server was Jackie. She was great. Thank you for making our evening unique and memorable!"}
{"text":"one of the best!!  we've found a new favorite!  my husband and I had dinner here and were very impressed, from the house made popcorn, to the most delicious desserts, we loved every morsel!  the staff and our server were very friendly and attentive the entire evening.  the view is spectacular and the decor as well.  we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food, drinks, decor and view were all beautiful.  The charcuterie and scallop starters were both delicious, pork chop was easily the best I'd ever had and deserts and drinks exceeded expectations.  I will absolutely return ... and hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"I have been dying to go to Altius since several Pittsburgh-based friends recommended it. Short story: The service was wonderful; view was beautiful; wine list was nice. Unfortunately, the food was mostly inedible or subpar. And we come to restaurants for food at the end of the day, right? The charcuterie and bread service were nice, and the cocktails were good.   For starters: The chef sent out an amuse bouche - before dinner - hot cocoa. Totally inappropriately placed (right before scallop ramen?? How does that sound right?). Scallop ramen was inedible. Harvest salad wasn't substantive (\"was a candied walnut salad with a side of vegetables\"). Beef tartar was giant; friend could only eat half.  Main courses: Salmon, special turbot, sea bass were all fine... Everyone said it was not great. Pork chop was overcooked AND greasy. Sides were cold. The manager took the pork off the check, and subbed sea bass, but by then it was totally disruptive to our dinner.  We turned down dessert, and while waiting for a check, someone came out to say we couldn't order dessert because the pastry chef left. Sloppy service.  All in all, the service was very well meaning and the view is incredible, but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"The view is awesome! The service is also great. The food is fine compared to that price. Sushi is not really good because the rice is not good. Fish and crab cakes are great"}
{"text":"Great dinner! Its relatively pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"First timers last week.  Stopped in without reservation and was luck enough to get a seat.  My wife and I enjoyed everything from start to finish.  Our waitress was very pleasant and made great recommendations.   Good wine selection.  We started with meat and cheese board, followed by pork chop and sea bass entrees... Both were nice portions and prepared perfectly.  We wrapped up with a sweet potato dessert that was small but very tasty.  Only negative, was it is a bit pricey...but for view and quality, well worth it for special occasions."}
{"text":"Truffle popcorn, creme fresh caviar mini snow cones, and amazing rosemary butter and sundried tomato spreads with the fresh baked breads.  They also  have plenty of great animal dishes, but the vegan ravioli was incredible."}
{"text":"If there were 10 stars, I would choose that option.   You absolutely cannot go wrong here!  Been here for dinner about half a dozen times and never a complaint.  Last time was a few weeks ago for my 22nd wedding anniversary.   Ordered the oysters for an app with champagne dressing.   Beyond delectable!!!!!  Hubby got steak and I had the most amazing sea bass!!!!  We split a panna cotta for dessert and it was so delicious!!!! You will not be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"I had the scallops with the bacon risotto and honey crisp apple and it was amazing. I think about that meal all the time. My boyfriend got the duck and liked it. For desert we had the apple donut thing. Also, definitely get the brussel sprouts. Very nice service, nice atmosphere, and I loved the presentation. If you like mixing sweet and savory foods there's a lot of options throughout the menu that has subtle mixes of the two and I loved it. Views were to die for!"}
{"text":"Heard good things, but left with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.  To start- Valet is $6 up front with cash, but if you pay with a credit card later it jumps to $10.   This is ridiculous, they should validate your parking anyways since you pay a premium to eat there.  Maybe over a certain amount validate it, but still at least offer it to your patrons.  The place is beautiful and they really did a nice job with all the windows and decor, but it was freezing.  I asked if they could turn the air down a bit, and the guy responded with \" Yes, you should have brought a Shaw\"  Sorry, host, I didn't realize I was going into the arctic tundra.  The drink prices are outrageous, there was no glass of wine under $12. Hell, I think there was only one glass for $12.  The rest went up, and up, and up.  I appreciate the Stemware they served each varietal in, but cut us some slack. Drinks were $13 and higher. My first drink had a chip in the glass, the swapped it out.  Pittsburgh is getting a bit crazy with drink pricing,  it is now cheaper to drink in some parts of NYC.  We got some appetizers, and while  I appreciate the truffle popcorn they give you, it seems out of place, the charcuterie was $16 and it was all toasted bread, not a lot of meat.  Crested Duck was the meat, and I know the cost of a thin slice of that stuff, so please put a bit more on the board. Beet terrine was good.  Nothing crazy.  For dinner I got the pork chop medium rare.  It was so overcooked I couldn't cut it.  I had to send it back, my friend got the gnocchi, and it was bland.  Others got the fish dish and said it was good, not great.  My pork was $32.    The highlight of the meal were the desserts.  Flan and a chocolate torte were very good.  All in all I do not think I would return, way spend for what you get.  They need to reevaluate their drink pricing.   That may be why they don't post pricing online. I tried to look up wine prices, no luck.  Only a note that if you wanted to bring your own bottle.   It had to be of EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY, and that they would charge $25 cooking fee, but would wave it if you bought a bottle of theirs.  Silly.  I Will spend my money on Avenue B any day of the week."}
{"text":"Wow. We're food snobs who believe that nothing really extraordinary happens outside of New York or Philly. Pittsburgh? Come on. Well shame on us. We just had the most amazing dining experience - from the view to the awesome Purple Rain cocktail to the appetizer, dessert - everything and everyone just blew us away."}
{"text":"WOW. Just WOW!  We were on a mission to celebrate a special occasion with my husband tonight and apparently we chose wisely!  The greeting... The view... Our table... All were a great start to our experience here.   First the popcorn. Then the bread and the tomato paste and herb butter that comes with. Delicioso.  And before our starter, we were served a complimentary \"first bite\" by the chef. Again delicious. Finally for our starter, we ordered the steak tartar. It comes with garlic infused potato chips and based on a layer of diced capari & pickles. The best steak tartar I've ever had.  As for the main course, I ordered the Chilean sea bass while my husband went for an off-menu item which was a humongous rib eye. Both were to die for! It was the most amazing meal I've had for a very long time. Sadly, we had no room left for a dessert.   Our waitress (Nathan) was super informative, attentive and kind and at the end of the night we were sent off with two small bags of complimentary sweets. All in all it was a flawless night, it literally couldn't be any better. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"2017 wedding anniversary, here we go.  First a big shout-out to our waitress, Autumn. She was fantastic. Unfortunately, she and the view from Mt. W. were the saving grace of the evening.  View, services, atmosphere were all great, but I expected more for the food.  Give them the benefit of doubt, it was Sunday and there was a big event happening, so maybe they were busy. Jumbo Lump Crab Cigar was alright. The crust was thick. The side dishes were really good, but the Crab Cigar itself was a bit let down. For a $19 starter, I guess I expected more crab meat and thinner shell? (king crab legs, maybe?)  Entrées we had a $45 fish (forgot what it was) and $55 ribeye (21 days dry-aged).  The fish was so-so and the steak was fat and under-cooked. Should have just gone for scallops. I think the Brussel sprouts were over-cooked. (see photos)  For desserts, we had White Chocolate Macadamia Ball. They ask you to video it, but honestly, it is not that video-worthy. Yes, hot sauce melts the chocolate ball. This is not 1997, just do it. Secondly, the table light is overhead and when you pour the sauce over the dessert, the hand casted a shadow over the ball. The lighting makes recording very difficult. Saw this happened to like 3 tables.   Overall, I actually really enjoyed the evening.  5* for services, the view, the atmosphere. Maybe 3* for the food that night.  Certainly had better food at this place (it was a Thursday).  And will be back."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Views were unbeatable- reservations were made in advance, and we were happy to get a table at the window. The menu changes seasonally, so this review may not address the dishes available currently. As others have mentioned, we were offered popcorn and an amuse bouche. Bread was excellent. We tried a few appetizers, including a strawberry prosciutto dish and the She Crab Bisque, which was fine. We also tried the Berkshire Pork Chop, Strip Steak, and a salmon dish. Everything was done very well.  Service was attentive and polite, and the views were amazing. Overall, the meal was great."}
{"text":"Great view, great service, great price, good food.  The only complain is that the portion is little bit small. This could be that the food was so delicious that I felt the portion was small. The sea bass was very good. Corn Mascarpone Ravioli is on sweet side, but I enjoyed a little bit sweetness. The table side dishes were not impressive; we didn't finish them (Risotto Broccolini).  Our waitress was very fun and nice. Love her. Dessert is very nice."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Altius as I had heard so many positive things about it, and it definitely lived up to the expectation! The bread and popcorn appetizer is perfect. The sea bass was incredible. I can not wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I was there this weekend for the first time and loved the place. Good ambiance! Great views!! Wonderful food and high five service. I would go back!! I was celebrating anniversary and they accommodated us in a really nice table. We were pleased and loved the evening."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant from start to finish, with a fantastic view of the city to boot. After the goat cheese / honeycrisp apple amuse bouche, we split the crab toast appetizer which was loaded with very fresh butter poached crab meat. We followed up with the simple, but well executed, fried green tomatoes. I had the pork chop with bacon bourbon reduction and candied pistachios, perfectly grilled and tender as any pork chop I've ever eaten. My girlfriend had the Amish chicken breast with sweet corn hash that had a mesquite overtone that was outrageously good. Bread service had many delicious options which was definitely a plus. To finish the meal we split the chocolate creameaux served with honey tuile, honey whipped cream, and caramel brulé bananas. An unbelievably rich but well balanced dessert. A bourbon fan, I also couldn't pass up the liquid chocolate bourbon ball dessert cocktail which also was out of this world.  And after all that food, they still gave a little snack bag with a small bite of some sort of  chocolate cookie/brownie concoction that was also very good.  Service was well orchestrated and the staff was polite and professional. The meal price is as to be expected and frankly, quite reasonable given the outstanding meal and ambience. I would recommend Altius to anyone  looking for a stellar meal with an even better view of the city.  Also, this is right next to the Duquesne incline and not far from other fantastic views of downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a place that fits romantic without the pretentiousness and I have found it! Altius met or surpassed all of my expectations.   At first sight, the outside of the restaurant is not giving you a true vision of the wonderful experience that you are about to have! Once you step inside you will be blown away! First, the hostess was a pleasure. She was sweet and accommodating and excited to welcome us. Then we got the best seat, next to the window ( all of the seating is spectacular). Check out my pictures to see the beautiful Mt. Washington view featuring the Point Park Fountain.  The staff was great. Our server was so attentive. She had answers to all of our questions and even brought out a container for us to take a picture of a pepper that we loved :-) The food was amazing! We started with an amuse bouche that is always fun! Then we tried the charcuterie because I always do especially if it includes honey! And it did!  I had chicken. I never ever have chicken but it came with acorn squash arancini and it was like eating a piece of Fall. Seriously, it tasted like pumpkin pie!   I couldn't dessert. I wanted to dessert. But, I was full. They portions are large!  They sent us home with a cute little baked good in a cute bag and made us feel special.  Love love love. Will be going many more times!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary.  It has a beautiful view of the city. If you go I strongly recommend you make a reservation.  It is pricey, but it's great for a special occasion!  The waiter we had was amazing and made excellent suggestions. We had pork chop and Brussel sprouts, and it was amazing.  We would definitely recommend this restaurant and going back in the future."}
{"text":"Very nice setting and the view is amazing! Small and intimate! Our waitress was nice and accommodating. I ordered the chicken and it was delicious. Ended the night with creme brûlée with was yummy also. One bad thing I will say is the lights in the restaurant flicker when the incline cable car ride is going on due to the restaurant and incline being on the same power supply. It was a little distracting. Overall I would go back I enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"Extremely clean and modern restaurant with beautiful views over looking Heinz and downtown Pittsburgh. Can take the trolley up the hill and walk. Came for a work event and the food was delicious. Service was great and staff was very accommodating. Great place for a date or to take a client for dinner."}
{"text":"After an exhilarating evening trip on the Dusquene Incline the Altrius is located within steps of the incline station. I popped in for a drink and a quick bite to eat. It was busy as we are still in the holiday weekend so I grabbed a seat at the tall tables for that casual last minute seat. I ordered an appetizer as I don't have a large appetite any more and the Heron Point Crab Toast was the perfect evening snack for the light eater! Fluffy flavorful wild caught colossal crab, accentuated with grilled artichoke cream cheese, basil aioli, rustic baguette, and petit herbs. What a yummy culinary delight overlooking the skyline of Pittsburgh! I recommend Altius for those memories accompanied with delicious food. Also an extra special THANK YOU to my waiter Cameron!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, view, and food. Hands down my favorite restaurant when visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"As good as it gets! Altius has finally combined great food (best lamb I have ever had), good service (offered to change our table for a better view), and awesome ambiance (decor was well done and the view is the view). My only critique is the food was a little on the pricey side but it is worth it. As a Mt. Washington resident, I hope Altius raises the ante for the other restaurants in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This evening we found a superlative way of YELPING a restaurant. I had the pleasure of having two wonderful lady's as my guest for birthday dinner at Altius Modern Bistro.  My Mother in Law's birthday is July 5 and my wife's birthday is May 31.  We were seated at a wonderful window table with a sweeping view of Pittsburgh and the three rivers.  Mom gave a WOW for the view. We each ordered separate appetizers. Mom rated her She Crab Soup with WOW WOW as she demolished the bowl.  My wife had the beet terrine. And I had the Charcuterie which were very unexpectedly delicious.  That added two more WOW'S. Mom ordered Rack of Lamb. It was an unusual serving for a traditional older lady who is used to each lamb rib to be sliced and displayed around the plate. She chewed each chop. to the bone with another WOW!  My wife had the Berkshire Pork Chop.  She added a WOW!  I had the Duck, Duck, Goose which had perfectly cooked Duck breast, leg confit and Goose pate mixed with polenta and another WOW was added to the dinner.  Being the lady's birthday celebrations each was served a Malted Vanilla Bean Pot de Creme with a candle.  Another WOW was entered into the list.  Our server, Rob was delightful and very professional.  The entire staff was helpful, efficient, professional and gracious.  Another WOW!  This was an 10 WOW dining experience. Thank you all for making our dining experience wonderful. FYI: We are all senior citizens and we have all traveled the world."}
{"text":"Altius exceeded expectations. I've looked in and looked at the menu about two years ago right around when they got their 4 Diamond status and judged the book by its cover. I just didn't think it was going to deliver for some reason. I'm sorry, I was 100% wrong.   The view: Unmatched in the whole city. There's hardly a bad seat in the joint, and the window sills are low enough that even if you're not at a window table the view is not obscured.   The service: The service was excellent. It was polite, friendly, not obtrusive but attentive. We had a drink at the bar and the front of the house checked in to let us know the status of our reservation (we were a little early) and were just totally straight and courteous about everything the whole time.   The food: This was where I was remaining skeptical. But after the appetizers of charcuterie plate and crab toast I was sold. The crab toast was absolutely excellent. Perfect execution. The charcuterie was on the small side but well executed with local cured meats and delicious side sauces/toppings.   The entrees solidified my realization that my skepticism was errant. Her filet was very good and the potatoes au gratin and mushroom sauce was spectacular. My sea bass was perfectly cooked and topped with an unbelievable crab beignet.   Since everything was so good I had to order some dessert to get a full representation of the menu. We're not huge dessert orderers, but it was also very good. It was big enough to share and not too sweet.   All in all a very memorable evening and I will recommend to everyone I know for a good while.   PS. The price: Totally fair. Champagne cocktails for $12, filet (10oz) $44. For a location and with service like this and great food as well, this is actually a steal!  PPS. Forgot to mention the house crack/popcorn at the start and the amazing bread selection thereafter!"}
{"text":"Wow, Altius hits the nail on the head on everything, I don't know where to start. Amazing atmosphere, superb service and food fit for the pickiest of foodies from their in-house made popcorn, lavender honey focaccia and mint chocolate bomb. Just wow."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed by the food here. Loved the atmosphere and service. I ordered the duck and while it should come medium rare to medium, this duck was still quacking and was like duck sushi. My wife got the shrimp which she enjoyed. An octopus feta taster came out from the kitchen and just tasted like feta.  I will probably go back again sometime to give it a second chance. Everyone has a bad day, right?"}
{"text":"Wonderful Restaurant with an Iconic View.   My husband and I just celebrated our wedding anniversary at Altius and it was a fantastic experience!! Food was delicious and very memorable. The service is EVERYTHING you want from a top of the line restaurant. I highly recommend this for any special occasion or out of town guest.   For our appetizer, we had champagne, oysters, and prawns. Everything tasted great and presentation was excellent. Main course I had the Arctic Char Special and it was to die for!!! The skin was served on top, crispy and delicious. English Pea and Mint Puree with fingerling potatoes, etc. etc. I could go on. My husband really enjoyed his Halibut too. Dessert was a delicious deconstructed banana's foster and it might have been the best thing we had all night! Usually I don't like deconstructed deserts but this was excellent.   Overall fantastic meal and fantastic experience. I really hope this restaurant is here to stay. I have been to many of the fine dining restaurants that come and go in Pittsburgh, but I think Altius has what it takes to last a long time.   Shout out of our fantastic server, Yoseph! You were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Altius sits atop Mt. Washington and every table has an amazing view of the City and the 3 rivers. It is just stunning.  The service is excellent and the servers know the menu well and can guide you. They have a decent wine list, albeit a bit pricey. Everything on the menu is amazing. We had the duck and a steak and they were perfect as were the sides.  They have a full bar and the drinks are great. You will love this place."}
{"text":"I think this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh for American (new). The service was exceptional. The food was to die for. Honestly probably the best meal I've ever had. The presentation was on point.  I had an amazing birthday dinner! The drinks were great. I got the Pennsylvania duck, it was cooked to perfection and the flavor was balanced - sooo good! I tried the Chilean sea bass it was also amazing. The scallop appetizer was great. The strawberry appetizer was interesting and very good. The best part of the meal was the chocolate ball desert - I have no words! I am dying to return here!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to Altius, but the experience left me lacking. I didn't hate it, but I wasn't blown away.   I'll start with the positives. I love that every table starts with a bowl of popcorn. I'm not sure if the flavor changes, but we had this amazing savory chicken and waffles flavoring. The food is great, there is no doubt about it. It's pretty meat heavy, so vegetarians beware. The small plates were all delicious and I had an amazing short rib with mole for an entree. The cocktails were great too, and my party all commented on how great the wine list is.  So what went wrong? Call me crazy, but I have certain expectations when I go to a restaurant where most entrees are $40+. One of those expectations? That it's properly, or should I say consistently lit. Due to sharing a power grid with the incline, the lights in the restaurant flickered every time the cars ascended or descended. I think this wouldn't be a problem early in the evening, but we had a late dinner. The lights were during up and down fairly often. it was really noticeable, it was like someone was playing with a dimmer switch. It took asking a few servers until we discovered why--most of them brushed it off, pretended they didn't know, or said \"Our building is haunted\".    I think in the end, I would return here, but not for a full meal. The view is great, but I'd only stay for a drink as to avoid the dizzying light-changes."}
{"text":"Service at Altius is top notch.  To notch.  Interior, atmosphere and view are also impeccable.  My only reason for three starts (rather than higher) was that my strip steak was served warm bordering on not warm.  At the end of the day it's all about the food.    Our server Melissa on the upper level was simply spectacular.  Spectacular."}
{"text":"Incredible. Service , food, drinks all incredible. The views of the city are breathtaking. Will go back again and again. Even just sitting at the bar for a bite and drinks is a great seat in the house. Use the valet service if able because parking is tough to find depending on time of day."}
{"text":"We have been to Altius five times and each time I felt like they were so, SO close to hitting it out of the park. This latest visit left no doubt that they have hit their stride. The service, as always, was fantastic but this time everything about the food hit its mark. Tatare - a home run - Sea Bass - amazing - cocktails - perfect. Everyone at the table loved their meal. They were understaffed (some call offs I think) and everyone pitched in and you would have never known it - kudos to the wait staff. My husband booked dinner here for my birthday and I was a little skeptical because it's never blown me away, but this time it really did - again we have a restaurant on Mt Washington worth the view, which hasn't been the case since the Leipharts left Isabela."}
{"text":"Great service and food!  It was our 6 year anniversary and they were great, even when there was a small problem with our cheese tray.  They quickly solved it and our experience was great.  We will come back again as the views were beautiful and the service great!"}
{"text":"This is truly the most divine dining experience in all of Pittsburgh. I was given a 200 dollar gift certificate here and spent all of it (2 of us). First, they start you off with a fancy popcorn. I say fancy because it had spices that I can't remember. It's free. What isn't free is the water. You'll be charged 3 dollars per bottle so just FYI. Then comes the bread tray with 2 types of butter. Over the course of the meal, I tried all three bread varieties and the best is the focaccia. For starters we had the crab toast. This was so delicious I'm going to come back here and order 3 orders and ask them to plate it as a main. Next was the Hokkaido scallops. They were superb! Following that we had the razor clam and corn bisque which was delicious but slightly salty, so I asked for a second bread to mitigate the salt. We moved on to the main. Bf had the dry aged beef with truffle mash. I've officially run out of positive adjectives so il start repeating- it was delicious! Sadly, the only thing I would not order again was my actually my main- the lobster ravioli. It was sort of a let down for 40 dollars since I couldn't taste much lobster. We didn't have room for dessert but they did give us a complementary cookie and - forgot to mention- a complementary bite appetizer. They were very knowledgeable about the menu, and friendly, not pretentious at all. Service was great. Cocktails were excellent. Oh- almost forgot, breathtaking views of the city! It has a nice homey feel and you feel very welcome, which is why I didn't ding it a star for the few dishes I wasn't head over heels for. Can't shoot 100 percent! Will definitely be back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Dined here for a team dinner with work colleagues and loved both the food and the service. Pork chops were delicious and enormous and the desserts were all tasty.   Service was impeccable. Even when we absentmindedly added a tip at the end for a large group, they called to say they figured we didn't want double gratuity and would only charge us the original amount!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh recently with very little knowledge of the city, and I happened across Altius on Yelp.  It was an excellent experience!  The service is quick and professional, the waitstaff is very knowledgeable and confident, the dining is both intimate and spacious, and the view of downtown Pittsburgh is awesome.  I went at night, with clear weather, and I really think that might give one the best views.  One feels as if he is floating above a fiery, jeweled, enchanted landscape.  The location is convenient to downtown.  The dishes were well-conceived, and the wine list is good."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new and stumbled upon this place searching yelp for the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. Restaurant surpassed my expectations. I used to come here when it was the Georgetown Inn and wow was that place terrible. View was beautiful and I always seemed to go back despite the inexcusable food. I had always thought - if only this place would have decent food it would be one of the best restaurants around - has always had the best view in Pittsburgh in my opinion. Not only have they completely remodeled into a hip/modern restaurant but the food is true to the quality of their sister restaurant, Bistro 19, if not better. Wine list is good too, simple, ranging from approx $30 - $100/bottle. Had the short ribs and they were phenomenal. I almost gave this place a 4, just because I usually think of Alla Famiglia when I think of a true 5 star yelp review, but I thought to myself - hey, I don't have a bad thing to say about this place, why knock it the star. So there, 5 star, but really the 4.5 star average is about right."}
{"text":"Recently went here with my gf to celebrate and had a pleasant surprise.  The updated interior, menu, staff, awesome food were all on point and somehow the tab was only around $100 before tip.   This included a few vodkas (kettle one)  and a few glasses of wine.    Short review but long story short this place had good food,  better service and was well under what I expected to pay.   I will be back again.!"}
{"text":"Went to Altius for a dinner and was not dissaponted. This used to be the old Georgetown inn but has now been remodeled and modernized. The interior is different shades of grey including metal and grey wood throughout. The menu is small but has many options. While waiting for our meal we were served with homade kettle corn, and a bread service that has a few different selections of bread. Once the dinner came out it was delicious. The produce was obviously fresh and the meat tender. While this place is quite pricey it is good and includes a amazing view of the city. The only negative part I have is after the night I asked for a box. The waiter took the food to box it for me. However, once I got home I realized my take home consisted of just the meat from the dinner. The extra sides and extra we ordered was missing. Personally I belive for the price everything should be allowed to go home."}
{"text":"Several weeks ago, I was searching for a new restaurant to try with friends for my little 30th birthday celebration, and I stumbled upon Altius! I have lived in Pittsburgh for nearly six years and have avoided the stereotypical over-priced, under-delivering Mt. Washington restaurants. However, I was so impressed with the reviews for Altius that I couldn't resist finally going to my first Mt. Washington restaurant.  From start to finish, I was very impressed with the service. The parking valet was quick, particularly at the end of the night when there were a lot of us waiting for our cars at the same time. We were seated immediately when we arrived for our reservation. Our waitress was helpful and efficient, making good recommendations and going above and beyond to accommodate us.  The four of us started with drinks and an appetizer. I ordered the ¡Mi Corazón! cocktail with tequila, grapefruit, orange bitters,and an egg white. I liked the idea of all of the ingredients, but together, I actually thought the drink tasted a bit too smooth. We all shared the bacon wrapped dates appetizer, which was just heavenly. Apparently, the app only comes with three dates, but I really appreciated that our waitress offered to bring us an extra date since there were four of us sharing. For my entree, I selected the pork chop which was accompanied by a side of the purple potato purée and brussel sprouts. The pork chop was a huge cut of meat cooked to the medium rare perfection that I had ordered. It was tender with just the right amount of seasoning. The brussel sprouts were flavorful and topped with butter while the smattering of purple potatoes provided a fun and colorful side. We ended the meal by ordering butter pecan cheesecake. It was a classic, tasty, well-executed dessert that was the perfect ending to our delicious dinner.  Finally, that view -- just gorgeous. Unfortunately, we went just a couple weeks before the weather got nice and warm, so we stayed inside to take our fun Mt. Washington selfies. However, even with a little window pane glare, the view was still stunning, and the pictures turned out great!"}
{"text":"Since my boyfriend and I went for drinks, I have recently been back to Altius for a friend's birthday dinner. Was not impressed at all. The drinks were good, but the food overall was not. Very bland and not what I expected at all. I got the crab toast which was the only thing I truly enjoyed and would get the appetizers/small plates again; the entrees not so much.  My eggplant rolotini was very bland and chalky, other people at the table got the lobster ravioli which was terrible, barely any lobster and the flavor combos did not mesh well, especially for $40.  The service was great just very disappointed in the food. Would go back again but only for drinks or an appetizer before going somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"I came here for a one-year anniversary with my girlfriend and I can't think of another place that would have provided a better experience in the entire city. We got lucky with a table along the windows and I appreciate the more formal dress code. The service was amazing. We ended up having about 4-5 courses overall with free ranch popcorn, mini pancakes, and a range of different types of bread to start off (plus a complimentary cookie bar at the end).   The lobster vanilla bean bisque was presented very nicely with it being constructed in front of you and contained a broad range of flavors from candied chestnut, to croutons, vanilla bean, and then the orange cream. Everything was very well balanced, and the Ora King Salmon may have been the best I've ever had. My girlfriend had the Duroc Pork Chop, which I was fortunately able to taste and I'm in disbelief how such a thick cut of meat could have so much flavor evenly distributed throughout. The purple mashed potatoes were a nice touch and seasoned well. Overall, amazing!"}
{"text":"Picture this, Its Playoff weekend in Pittsburgh, we have a group of 6 that came from NYC too go to the Steelers  playoff game.   So I hear some great things about the Food at Altius.  I decide to make reservations for dinner the night before the game.    I read their web site that says dress is business casual,   No sneakers, No sweat's  No T shirts or sports wear.  Living in NYC and original from Pittsburgh,  we take dress code very casual,  so we dress accordingly Dress Jeans, dress shoes, some of us had button down collared  shirts  and 2 of were wearing Tommy Bahama Pull overs.   Here is where the problem came in,  we were informed by the hostess that we could not be seated due to a team logo on our Tommy Bahama Pullovers.   Ok I understand maybe if it were a Game jersey or a Cheap Walmart shirt, but we it is a Tommy Bahama Pullover that is respectfully designed.   We explained this to the hosted, and she agreed, but did not want to take a chance and called the manager.    The Manager came over and said no and cannot wear those shirts because it is sportswear and has team logo on it, and does not comply with our dress code.  I must say he was very rude and arrogant  how he approached us and spoke to us.   Living in NYC, I have dined at many restaurants,  and never have I been or seen anyone turned away because of our attire.     Maybe at  Daniel or Per Se they may have said something.    I have had dinners at Del-Posto, Gotham Bar and Grill and Gramercy Tavern, where our dress was more casual than the night at Altius and were not turned away.  So I did not have a chance to taste the food to see if it is all the Hype, But as for personality and customer service...  Horrible !   FYI  6 people Dropping at least $200 a head  is $1200 +   oh  what a shame for the waiter that lost a table and $240 + tip..  Ill assume that would have  been a Good night for a waiter in Pittsburgh..  We went to View 412 after being rejected . The service was great and the food was as good.   Also it was a sign from God, that we went to View 412 while there we had the pleasure to meet  Arch Bishop David Zubik,  and other member of his clergy.    ( They Loved our Tommy Bahama Steelers  pullovers )"}
{"text":"Finally.  Finally! A restaurant on Mt. Washington where the food and service match the spectacular views.  Quite an upgrade from the old tired Georgetown it replaced.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"An anniversary, a birthday, or just a beautiful night out--Altius is your stop for it all.  I was gifted a gift certificate to Altius from a friend and couldn't wait to check it out as I had recently moved to Mount Washington. It was a treat in itself to celebrate an event with a new restaurant. I had to switch my original reservation to an earlier date and the hostess was more than accommodating for helping me pick a new date and time.  Well, on that day we must have hit the jackpot, because not only did we have a window view upstairs, but we sat in the corner where the windows meet for what I think is the best seat in the house!  Our waiter started us out with an amuse bouche and some house popcorn--what a fun treat to start off a great meal. I asked the waiter some questions about what I had read from previous reviews and the menu on Yelp. Apparently the info on Yelp menu-wise is not up-to-date (can you see my sad face finding out they did not have polenta?). But we marched forward because there were so many other great options.  We ordered the Charcuterie because who doesn't love cheeses?! It included honeycomb (fav) and various cheese. I could have just had a second of this and the night would have been complete, but then we ordered our meals.  We ordered the lamb chop and the sea bass. Both were cooked well. The lamb--one piece was perfect the other a little well done, but still delicious.  For desert we got the cheesecake, which was really like an espresso pot de creme In the form of a cake slice. Usually I am not one for desert, but this one was outstanding.  An amazing gem on Mount Washington--we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of those times that I wish Yelp had an option to give more than five stars!! Altius rocked it and rocked it hard. Among the best and most memorable food plus service I have had in my life! My one quibble was the additional 15 min wait to get seated despite a booking but our wonderful server and the fantastic food more than made for it - and of course, can't forget the amazing views of Pittsburgh city lights!!  As soon as we were seated our server bought us a cone of kettle popped gourmet popcorn - nice and light way to start snacking while pondering the drink menu. They've got a great selection of non-alcoholic drinks and I tried the ginger ale which was fabulous. After drink orders, we were surprised with a lovely amuse-bouche, a salmon spread served in a miniature ice-cream cone so great blend of salty and sweet. After taking a bite of this amuse bouche, I knew I was in for a treat with the food for the evening.  My table started off with a Charcuterie appetizer - lovely cheddar, blue cheese and Brie sourced from local Amish farms, gorgeous honeycomb, lovely apple sauce and mustard sauce, plus smoked wagyu beef, ham & prosciutto plus toasted bread. From the cheese selection, I loved the brie. The blue cheese was fairly mild and the cheddar had a lovely snap to it. From the meat selection, the prosciutto was definitely the table favorite followed by the ham and then the wagyu. This is a great dish to share with folks on your table.  For my main dish selection, I couldn't pass up the Seabass and I am so glad I got this dish! I also had a bite from my dinner companion's scallops which blew me away - I was expecting American scallops but instead the scallops were sustainably sourced from Japan and their naturally sweet taste just shined brightly. Both dishes were just wonderful & I felt as if the chef had gone out maybe an hour before we came and freshly caught the fish and the scallops - it was really that good!!  The sauce for my Seabass was just so incredibly luscious and rich but it also ate light. Also my Seabass was cooked so beautifully and with just such a light touch that it was meltingly tender. I also got crisp green beans as part of this dish that were crisp and juicy. My least favorite part of this dish was probably the risotto as I got some bites where the rice was a wee bit undercooked. But OMG that sauce - I actually asked for a spoon as it was so good and I didn't want to waste a single drop of the sauce.  After the amazing food, I didn't have much room for dessert and so decided to skip. But there was a lovely treat in store for us as we got a gift bag with a hazelnut slice to take with us along with our cheque. Also for the cheque, since we were a party of more than 6, a 20% gratuity was automatically added and it was very classy that our server mentioned that tip inclusion to us verbally, when handing over the bill.  I would absolutely come back here again when next in Pittsburgh!  Note: #328 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Of course you can't beat the view. For me, due to the prices , it would be a place I'd go for a special occasion. The start off with a mini appetizer compliments of the chef. They bring around fresh baked breads while you wait for your meal. I had the shrimp. It was 4 jumbo shrimp with pomegranate rosotto. It was amazing. I finished the whole plate. Others in my group enjoyed their meals also. The pork chop is the size of the plate and thick. Dessert had a beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"This restaurant is SUPERB. From the hostess (Patty - so personable!!) to the wait staff (Jackie is exceptional!!), you will have a dining experience like none other. The cocktails are seasonal and so very creative. The two bartenders are both excellent. And the food... Mouth-watering! I am not a foodie but I am willing to try anything on their menu because it is so good. Flavorful. Creative combinations. Hard to choose between the entrées. I had the salmon with English pea risotto - perfect. And dessert... The chocolate ball was awesome! This is THE top tier restaurant in Pittsburgh. The city view is magnificent but it is what occurs within the walls and glass of Altius that draws us back here again and again. If I could give ten stars I would!!"}
{"text":"If anyone ever says anything about this place they are lying through their teeth. I don't know why someone would to begin with. But not only is the food amazing here. The service was above and beyond. My date and I were so happy.  The location is perfect on top of a hill (haha) & everyone of course wants the window seat for a view. Luckily we caught one!  The inside was beautiful. It's just simulating how good it looked. Everything was blissfully clean.  THE FOOD WAS TO DIE FOR. It was hands down one of the best meals I've ever had. Coming from a HUGE foodie like me that means a lot. They gave us seasoned popcorn to nibble on, yum! They also gave us a mini pancake with brie & a jam? Soooo good!!! & then we also had some bread before dinner. All sweet little treats to build up to the main course. I ordered the duck which has these beautiful sauces, perfected cooked duck, warm cooked carrots & the CHEESY GRITS YUUUUM. My date ordered the pork chop which was the biggest I've ever seen. Tasted amazing as well!! (I forget what was on his plate). We also ordered the strawberry appetizer. So freaking good as well. Everything that we ate was nothing like I've ever had before. The food combos were to die for. Whenever we visit Pittsburgh now this is on our list everytime. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"The only thing that beats the view is the food. Reputation is best food in Pittsburgh. After just one visit I can see why. Very, very good."}
{"text":"This is a first class restaurant joining the ranks of Pittsburgh's finest! The wait staff are friendly, efficient and accommodating. They exhibit superior training. The food is outstanding. I had the amazing rack of lamb, cooked per chef's recommendation, medium rare. My wife had the salmon. Only quibble, restaurant a little noisy. But still that great Mt. Washington view. Next time, got to try some dessert."}
{"text":"Went for a valentines meal with my girlfriend. One of the absolute best meals I've ever eaten. Service was incredibly friendly and didn't mind at all that we didn't really fit the clientele (we're fairly broke grad students but wanted to treat our selves). Excellent view. Comfortable setting. Absolutely bank-breakingly expensive - but honestly worth it if you can swing it. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night for our anniversary.  The service was first-rate, from start to finish.  The wait staff was friendly and helpful without ever being obtrusive or (as is sometimes the case in high end restaurants) condescending.    The food was delicious, from starters to main courses to dessert.  There was a touch too much salt in a couple of the dishes for my taste, but otherwise everything was interesting, fresh, attractively presented, and tasty.    The decor was spare, but tasteful.  The view is, of course, magnificent.  And there isn't really a bad table in the restaurant, upstairs or down.  Finally, considering what you get, I think that the pricing is very reasonable.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is on Top. amaizing atmosphere  Delicious food . From appetizer to dessert.  Reasonable prices for quality of this food. all dishes just melt in your mouth.  We are celebrating my Wife Birthday  and we have no question to this place . recommended to every one who want And we celebrate my birthday here is well with 14 peoples, service one of the best.  Thank you Lyla for good take care of us. Thank Altius for such a great place."}
{"text":"For the best view in Pittsburgh, come here.   Seriously, the view is outstanding, and the restaurant itself is beautiful. I came here a while back, but I've fallen behind on my Yelp reviews, so I'm finally writing about this now!   As soon as we got there, the service was great. My friend and I were younger than most of the clientele there, but the hostess and our waiter were both extremely friendly.   From what I understand, the menu changes pretty frequently, so take what we ate with discretion. However, while I was there, they started my friend and I off with a complimentary pudding while we were looking over the menu. We ended up ordering a couple of different things, like a pork chop dish, and a charcuterie plate, and a coconut creme brulee. I think we also had a fish dish that was pretty good. Anyways, the winner was definitely the charcuterie plate. If it's still on the menu, get that.  I  believe that there's a dress code for the restaurant, so remember to look for that before heading out to eat some good food!  My only qualm is I still don't know how to pronounce the name of the restaurant. Al-tius? Al-tie-us? Al-tee-us?"}
{"text":"My first experience as Altius was nothing short of amazing. My friend suggested this place as a \"graduation celebration/welcome to adulthood\" spot. And boy was I impressed. We were seated by the corner window, and the view was stunning. The restaurant decor is modern and minimalist. Throughout the meal the chef offered complimentary tastings. The cocktails have to be some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our waitress explained the menu to us and gave us several suggestions. For my main course I ordered the steak which was perfection. For dessert I got the tiramisu. Amazing. When we left they gave us a small treat in a black baggy. This added the perfect touch. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner with amazing views of the entire city.  Service was excellent. Each course of food top notch. Made our 15th anniversary celebration amazing."}
{"text":"I took my husband to Altius for our wedding anniversary. For $50 per person, we got two starters, a glass of wine, two amuse bouches, an entree, unlimited bread with herbed butter or garlic and sun dried tomatoes, and two little dessert bites. Like most fine restaurants, when we didn't have room to order a full dessert, they offered us a small complimentary? one. We had a great seat overlooking the rivers, and our waitress was pleasant. The steak was par for the course; my husband has eaten similar ones for $10-20 less. However, my watermelon salad and scallops with risotto were excellent. The scallops are listed as a starter but are substantial enough to be an entree. Although it didn't pair particularly well with either of our dishes, I chose the glass of Sauvignon Blanc, which had a nice bite. The price is high enough that we will only eat dinner here for special occasions, but maybe we'll come back sooner to try their deconstructed desserts."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting and excellent food! Each course was better than the next. Charcuterie appetizer was fun and delicious. I had the Amish chicken with carbonara, poached egg and brussels spouts. My boyfriend had lamb with cabbage and root veggies. Both were amazing! Dessert was my favorite course. I got mousse and he got mint chocolate cake. Yummmm! Would definitely go back for a special occasion. A little too pricy for a regular date night."}
{"text":"I just went there with a group of 5 people, it was the first time for each of us. They reserved a perfect table for us with a beautiful view against the window. Its Mt Washington so obviously views are everything. The decor is modern chick, playing off black, white, brown. I think the chairs at our table might have been different from the rest, but we have cool chairs the spin. I like that majority of the tables there are window tables.   They made our first time feel very special- service was great. I appreciate that they have a bread selection and give dip pairings for them. I had the lobster and vanilla bean bisque as a starter. The soap itself was great to try something different, had a unique vanilla taste to it(real vanilla, not abstract) and very smooth.  The only reason I wouldn't order this again is because I prefer a bisque with a fair amount of lump meat in it, whether it be shrimp, lobster or crap. But great flavor!   The staff/kitchen was very accommodating with our orders. I know it's very bratty to ask to change the sides that come with a dish, but we did. And they responded kindly (without any hints of secret judgement on their face). I had the Salmon done medium and had a bacon risotto with it and 1 scallop on the side. You can ordered scallops for $10 per scallop to any entree. Really good! Ordering the scallop on the side, well not to sound to jealous but if mine had been the size of my friends, I would have been okay adding one $10 scallop. I don't know if they lucked out or if I was just unlucky, theirs were huge, my was okay. I'd say theirs was worth $10, mine was worth $5. But taste and flavor, all good. My friends also ordered Salmon and the pork chop. The pork chop was huge! If you order that, come prepared to EAT!  One thing I want to just say again, the service really was WONDERFUL."}
{"text":"Excellent experience all around. Very elegant, but not overly stuffy. However, business casual attire is a minimum and a jacket is recommended. Everyone here wants a table by the window, but even if you don't get one (we didn't), don't panic!The view is spectacular from every seat in the house because the place is so small (perhaps intimate would be a better description?). We were even treated to an awesome unexpected fireworks display from PNC Park after a Pirates victory! Aside from the great view everything else here is top notch as well, including the service, the food, the atmosphere... simply everything. From the second we walked in the  entire staff made my fiancé (who was celebrating a birthday) and I feel like we were the most important people in the restaurant. We indulge in fine dining several times a year and found the prices to be surprisingly reasonable for what we received. Altius may have just become our new go-to for special occasions, out-of-town guests or when we just feel like a delicious and elegant dining experience."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our one year anniversary and it couldn't have been a better choice. Since I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore and it was her first time visiting, I really wanted her to eat atop Mt. Washington. After speaking to my friends (who are hardcore foodies) and reading reviews on tripadviser and yelp, it became clear that Altius was the place to go. Making a reservation was painless and I asked for a window with a view since it was our anniversary. Making no guarantees, they said they would try their best to accommodate.   When we arrived, the valet (I think it was $6-8) was polite and quick. Since we arrived about 15 minutes early, our table wasn't ready, but they did seat us in the bar. They had an excellent choice of wines, cocktails and craft beers. I ordered a wheat beer and my wife ordered a cocktail. The bartender gave us some crunchy snacks that were well-flavored. After five or so minutes we were seated along the window (as requested) and it was an AMAZING view. The maitre d' brought over our unfinished drinks as the server was brining their signature flavored popcorn appetizer (complimentary).   For appetizers my wife ordered the oysters and I ordered a creative gourmet take on a caesar salad that utilized kale, thick cut bacon pieces, hand shaved fresh cheese, duck egg and fresh anchovies. Everything had proper texture, flavor and the portion sizes were just right. The oysters came with an angel hair, cucumber melody that was slightly sweet. A great compliment to the saltiness of the oyster.   For the main course my wife had the duck duck goose, while I ordered lamb and pom frites. All the meat was savory, well-portioned and cooked to proper textures. While it came with sauce on the side, the infused seasoning and quality of the meats made them delicious and well enough to stand on their own. The duck, duck, goose was paired with polenta and kale. We also added a side of grilled asparagus that were done right. My rack of lamb had wonderful sautéed mushrooms, a garlic risotto and carrots to accompany, all of which were top notch. The added pom frites came with ketchup, aioli and a foie gras-based sauce.   For desert, we coconut fruit plate and soufflé were outstanding. They were not overly rich or fatty tasting but fresh, light and just the right amount of sweetness to finish a meal. I also had a cup of the house coffee which was rich and flavorful.   The service was wonderful. Our server was polite, moved quickly and made excellent wine recommendations. He also made sure our table always had enough free space and our water glassed full. The best touch of all? They surprised us with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate sauce on our dessert plate. We actually ended up staying about 20 minutes past closing (on accident) and not one time did we feel rushed or that the staff was annoyed. Very classy move by Altius.  The restroom was five star quality with artistic fixtures, scented candles and real hand towels. The overall decor was modern, minimalistic and clean. It was not old and stuffy like some of the other older restaurants on Mt. Washington. The crowd was relatively younger professionals but not too young.   We had a great time and though expensive, it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food here was simply amazing. My wife and I do a lot of home cooking so we are very critical of restaurant food in general. As a result of this experience, my we have decided that we are done eating out at cheap places. It is well worth it to save up the money and have a meal like this."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our first anniversary at Altius last night and I can't say enough about how perfect the experience was.  Chris/Kris greeted and sat us, and Nathan was our server for the night. Every staff member that visited our table (expos, bread service, sommelier, managers) was perfectly pleasant and professional, but Nathan was the star of the night. Oh, and, of course the food was absolutely mouthwatering. I'd give this restaurant a million more stars if I could."}
{"text":"Legitimately one of the greatest dining experiences I've ever had. Possibly THE greatest. PROBABLY the greatest. Loved everything about it: the food, the service, certainly the views. We ordered the scallops and duck, but it's sort of limiting just to list what we ordered, because it's all part of a much bigger show."}
{"text":"As a visitor from San Francisco and a previous Facebook employee who watched Mark Zuckerburg take the company public on wall street in a hoodie and jeans.  I assumed in 2016 money was money, and clothing should not matter, but not here. You must be DRESSED or they will turn you away. The best part is I have to laugh because the business should not be turning anyone away at this point, they look like they could use all the customers they can get."}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere at Altius were wonderful. There were 5 of us, and we all enjoyed it, 5 different dishes, all prepared very well. Generous portions, and great service."}
{"text":"From the service, Sherry, to the food, Chilean sea bass and the chocolate ball...everything was excellent! Definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great option on Mount Washington. The food was very good and the fresh baked breads were outstanding. A fantastic view complements an atmosphere not as stuffy as some of its neighbors on Grandview. There are a nice selection of entrees on the menu that would appeal to just about any taste. The prices seemed to reflect the quality of food quite well. Also, we shared the vanilla bean mousse dessert. The dish came with homemade shortbread cookies for dipping - delicious!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best restaurants in town and elsewhere. The service is equal to a 3 star Michelin  Restaurant with amazing views and the food is out of this world. I had the sea bass and pared it with a great cocktail. My daughter had the duck. All very well prepared and presented.  Loved it.  We also got popcorn, an appetizer with tartar tuna and  handmade chocolate truffles  to go all complimentary. I will be back soon on my next visit to Pittsburgh. The price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Finally food to match the view on Mt. Washington! Thank you."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks on a weeknight. The views are incredible. Come here for a date or special occasion and you will not be disappointed.   Staff, particularly the bar tenders, are overly friendly and accommodating. Drinks are creative and strong. We also ordered the charcuterie plate, which came with an assortment of meats, cheeses, pickles, and cherry peppers. after drinks and meats, we ordered dessert #gobigorgohome, or in our case, we went big AND went home: tipsy and satisfied."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant. The view, of course, is the highlight. But...the food is good as well. I just wasn't overly impressed with the food. I had rack of lamb which seemed to have more fat than usual, but the flavor was good. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Last night was my third visit to Altius--I had been previously for Restaurant Week and a fantastic brunch (which is unfortunately no longer available). The prices are high, which are substantiated by the excellent view, capable staff, and several surprise inclusions. We started off with house-seasoned popcorn (flavor of the day was bacon horseradish), and then were offered some breads and spreads. We had ordered the charcuterie platter to split among the 5 of us, but probably could have skipped it given that we were also treated to a delicious artichoke amuse bouche. The sundried tomato pesto accompanying the breads was phenomenal, and the herb focaccia was quite tasty.  The charcuterie platter was nice, but not standout. The pork chop, which is apparently a specialty of the house, was wonderfully tender and flavorful...and I don't like pork chops. Unfortunately for me, that was my husband's order, and I got the duck. While the skin was nicely crisp, the duck was medium well, and served with a very sweet orange sauce. The \"dirty rice\" accompanying it cut through some of the sweetness with its porky flavor, but I was giving the husband puppy dog eyes for more of his dish. Those who ordered seafood seemed pleased with their dishes; the sea bass in particular was cooked beautifully.  I've really enjoyed the desserts I've had previously at Altius, but we were too stuffed to indulge (the amuse bouche and bread courses were not featured on the RW menu). One nice feature about Altius is their \"horseshoe\" tables that can seat larger groups (5-8 people) without isolating anyone. Bottom line--a great place to go to impress a date or a group of out-of-towners, but a bit too spendy to be a regular haunt."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh and was brought here for dinner. It at the top of the duquesne incline.   The valet gets sketchy with the traffic on the road going by. It is located at the top of the hill on the river side, hanging off the hill. Great view. Inside was modern and worked well.   Staff were knowledgable and friendly.   Charcuterie was good. Rack of lamb was good. Only had 4 tiny asparagus on it though. Others enjoyed the steak tartare, pork chop, and ribeye.   Price: Well i didn't have to pay.   Overall, this is a special event, date night place unless you have money to burn. I would come back."}
{"text":"The view is stunning. No doubt about that. The service and food didn't match up to the sky high (see what I did there?) prices. I tried the Duck, Duck, Goose or something like that and it was actually a bit bland. The services left a bit to be desired as our waiter seemed to spend far too much time at other tables and wasn't available quickly when we needed something.   The view and decor are great, but the food is a bit overpriced given the quality/taste."}
{"text":"Came here with a long time friend and had a fantastic dinner. I had the shrimp and scallops with risotto and it was absoultely delicious. We also got the tongue pierogies which was also phenomenal. Also make sure to get the bisque (so good). Then i ended it with a dessert of the mint chocolate cake which was very well displayed. Would definitely come here on a date next time. Some of the best food i ever had."}
{"text":"Absolute trash. Drinks that taste like they were mixed by a 4 year old. Food that likely was seasoned by rubbing it along the floor and then searing it beyond the point of recognition. I would recommend McDonalds over this. Was highly recommended and was equally highly disappointing."}
{"text":"I've gotta give this place the full 5 stars. I was fortunate enough to visit for a recent business dinner, and it really is a wonderful place.  From the moment you arrive, Altius takes good care of you - the valet is completely (COMPLETELY) reasonable, and they are polite in helping your party inside. Once you enter, the staff are friendly, and the bar is well-stocked, with a very knowledgeable bartender ready to serve you a delicious aperitif or glass of wine. After your drink, you are exported to a nice table which is most likely within eyesight of one of the stunning hilltop views of this lovely city.  The food is the real reason to come here, however. No million dollar views can make up for bad food or bad service, and Altius does not disappoint! Our server was extremely attentive and thoughtful, and really did know what \"service\" means. I shared several items with the table, including their oysters (absolutely fabulous), scallops (divine), and charcuterie plate (delicious).  As a dedicated Yelper, I had, of course, checked out the reviews before my visit, and had read about the \"Duck, Duck, Goose\" entree, which piqued my interest. The dish was perfectly prepared and served at the correct temperature, with just the right amount of panache by our server team, who served the entire table simultaneously and with a well-practiced flourish. The portion was perfectly sized for a regular person, which is a refreshing take on restaurant food these days - I HATE to get heaping platters that are poorly arranged and prepared with mediocre ingredients. . Again, Altius appeared to use high quality ingredients, prepared in a multitude of delicious ways - loved it!  To end the meal, I indulged in their peanut butter bar, which was absolutely the right way to end the evening - it is attractive, well assembled, and just the right size to share with another person, making it the perfect dessert.  My only \"beef\" with Altius is their corkage fee, which I consider to be a bit predatory. I realize that establishments need to make up some of their revenue from beverage sales, but the high corkage fee was a bit surprising. It wasn't enough to make me take a star away, though.  Overall, a great night, in a beautiful setting, with good friends enjoying great food and drink! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food service view : outstanding.  To be recommended without hesitation Take the incline to reach the place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a true 5 star dining experience then this is your place. From the moment we pulled up until the valet brought our car back we received excellent service. We had a table upstairs by the windows. I felt a bit like a tourist taking my phone out and taking pictures of the view but I didn't want the beauty of it to go unnoticed.  We started dinner with a Charcuterie board. It was so tasty and amazing that we could have just had that and been pleased. The meats and cheeses went wonderfully together. The honey brought a touch of sweetness that was perfect. We loved the tiny round red peppers that brought the heat.  For my entree I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. It came beautifully cooked and the presentation was spot on. The Sea Bass had a crispy side which was face up. It was golden brown. The fish was juicy and flaky.  It was a nice sized portion. It tested on mashed purple potatoes and green beans. I left no food behind.  For dessert we ordered carrot cake. It wasn't your typical carrot cake. It was an elevated dessert. The presentation was beautiful and it was a perfect ending to a perfect meal.  Our check arrived with 2 small black bags. Each one had a truffle inside. I was incredibly full so I saved them for the next day. Oh my we're they tasty. The milk chocolate melted in your mouth.  I love this restaurant and I can't wait to go back and take friends. FYI-they have a small party room. The night we were there a surprise party was being held in the room. It would be great for a small wedding or baby shower, graduation party, rehearsal dinner, or any small gathering."}
{"text":"View is fantastic right next to Duquesne incline. Dress code is work casual not tennis shoes. We went on a Sunday night early. Reservation and highly recommended. I had rack lamb and with has scallops. My lamb was over cooked ordered medium rare it was more medium to medium well. It was still good. My wive had scallops and she really enjoyed them . Service was great. We also has desserts napoleon and PBC. Both were really good probably best part of meal at last for me. Hard not to recommend considering it is considered one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Simply amazing experienceOne of the best meals I've ever had. I had the Alaskan halibut which was incredible and some of my dining companions had the steaks which looked out of this world. Food was all top-quality perfectly prepared. The view was also very nice as well."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from Altius and I was so excited to hear that a new restaurant was coming to the neighborhood.   We decided to visit for brunch. At $29, the Prix Fixe brunch was a little more than I usually like to spend but man oh man it was worth it. I think my Crispy Amish Chicken Waffle Sandwich was blessed by sweet baby Jesus himself. The flavors were great, the chicken was juicy and perfect (local meat makes a difference) and the waffle was crispy and delicious!   A lot of the restaurants up here depend upon the Mt. Washington view to dazzle diners. They are one trick ponies. But not Altius. Sure, the view is impressive here but the food stood up on it's own.   The service was excellent and the decor was also impressive! Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"We just had an awesome experience at Altius! Our waiter, Nathan, was super great! He was very knowledgable, helpful, and friendly. Our dinner was one of the best we've ever had in Pittsburgh. If you are looking for an exceptional experience in Pittsburgh, then this is the place!"}
{"text":"As a foodie in Pittsburgh, the restaurant row of Grandview Avenue on Pittsburgh's Mount Washington is not a place I flock to often, but will change with the addition of Altius, which certainly ups the ante, by providing an outstanding dinging experience in addition to the view! The two level restaurant has a comfortable and very modern environment that is stylish, yet showcases the view off Pittsburgh, first and foremost. It may be pricey, but it's worth every penny, including the accoutrements, which include a cone of sea salt and kale popcorn upon seating; an amouse bouche from the chef, and bread service that includes three different awesome breads with two tasty spreads.  They oysters and the accompanying sauce were rock star quality. The beet terrine was different from the usual beet salad, and was perfect when sampled with the accompanying goat cheese. Fellow diners raved about the sweet potato soup and \"tongue and cheek\" appetizers. The sea bass over lobster couscous was excellent, if not quite hot off the stove, and the person in my group who used to operate a restaurant himself, gushed about the pork chop and its accompanying sides. The baked chocolate mousse and a very unique version of pot de crème were two of the best chocolate desserts that I've had in quite some time.  The wine list is great with a nice variety of options. Our server, Brenna, was friendly and true pro, who knew the menu well and provided flawless service, even if it felt a tad rushed toward the start of the meal."}
{"text":"Dined at Altius first time for a work networking event. Couldnt have been more pleased with the decor, ambiance, view, service, and food."}
{"text":"New favorite place. Amazing view of downtown Pittsburgh and great dishes. Took my parents here and they loved it. They started us off with truffle butter popcorn which I initially avoided to save room for my dinner, but after trying a few they were too addicting and we asked for more. Then they came with a  bread board with various to choose from and we tried one of each with their dried tomato spread and butter. Not bad. Afterwards, they came with tuna amuse bouche to cleanse our palette. Very refreshing.  For our appetizers we got the oysters, large succulent fresh oysters. No graininess, not chewy, good texture.  Entrees we ordered Chilean sea bass, pork chop, lamb rack, and duck. My favorite was the lamb. Cooked perfectly, and doesn't have that smell of lamb but had lots of flavor. The roasted vegetable complemented the dish perfectly. Pork chop was good too, huge portion and very surprised that it wasn't dry, extremely tender. Chilean sea bass you can never go wrong. The fish itself is inherently soft and buttery so I rarely have bad experience w Chilean. The duck was pretty good too, maybe my least favorite because it was pretty standard, didn't impress me as much as the other dishes but that doesn't mean it's bad.   We wanted dessert but were too full maybe next time. Overall really impressed with this place. Good good, good scene, and reasonably priced.  Food 5 Service 5 Price 5  Overall 5"}
{"text":"Go for the popcorn, go back for MARIA!  No seriously, beautiful atmosphere, excellent food, friendly service- 10/10, would recommend."}
{"text":"Five stars for everything! Probably one of the best, if not the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is to die for, and the service is exemplary. Beautiful redo of the old and weird and depressing Georgetown inn. The only downside, is that it is so exceptional, it's hard to get reservations!"}
{"text":"The food and service was incredibly good! We had pork chop and the lamb and they both were very delicious. Their vanilla ice cream had me licking the plate clean! And to top it all we had the best view in the city."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. View is beyond words. Portions extremely generous. Don't miss the opportunity to dine at this fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"Advice to interested patrons: For Saturday night reservations, I recommend going through opentable a week ahead.  Food: It was good. Not amazing. Probably the only non-perfect thing I have to say about this. I got the Duck entree. My girlfriend's lamb rack was delicious thought. Service: We had Doug, he was superb. Venue itself: Great decorations inside. Excellent use of curtianwall windows and lighting scheme that let's you focus on the view.   I'd come back (if I can manage to save $100+ again)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food was delicious and view was awesome and the staff knows what customer service is. The quick valet parking was a great touch and I thought the dress code was bothersome until I went there. This type of restaurant justifies a dress code. First Class!"}
{"text":"In a word: disappointing. We were not recipients of the excellent service others raved about. Reservations made almost 6 weeks ago didn't net us a window table. The threatening open table emails we received lectured that \"denim is strongly discouraged\". We worried about dress code only to see denim everywhere, along with flip flops and, on an infuriating note, a girl in a hoodie who was seated at a window table.   We waited a good 30 minutes for our drinks. No exaggeration. Our server's apology didn't make us less thirsty. We were served our truffle popcorn & amuse bouche before our first cocktail.   Steak was very definitely underdone, the other entrees were delicious. Complimentary desserts are a nice gesture except for the stale cookies that accompanied them.   A $500 bill and paying it while looking at that girl in the hoodie. (At a better table.)  And then the valet brought us the wrong car.   LOL. We should have taken it for a spin.   Not sure I'd bother again."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner for my boyfriend's birthday. The food was amazing as well as the view! Definitely a great choice for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"I wish I could actually rate this place (yelp made me put atleast one star), but after three attempts at making a reservation for New Year's Eve I have given up and decided to go with our back up reservation at Eleven. I called at the beginning of November and they said they only take reservations 30 days in advance - understandable. So, I made a note on my calendar and called on December 1st. But, I was informed that they were still not taking reservations until tomorrow or the next day. Called back today and they said they started taking reservations yesterday (I guess after I called at 3PM?) but they still could only take my name and number and call me back in 24-48 hrs because the girl organizing all the reservations didnt work today and only one person was taking reservations to \"keep it simple\"...yea, simple for them. I'm not trusting this place with my New Year's Eve reservations if they are giving me thing much of a runaround....maybe next year Altius."}
{"text":"Excellent view and the restaurant itself in nice. I went with a friend and we order to start the watermelon salad that was amazing (highly recommend it!) and the burrata which wasn't good at all, the almond oil was a bit overwhelming and that was all you could taste in the dish. For second course we share a special dish for the day, jumbo shrimp with lobster risotto and the steak, both really tasty and high quality, they were nice to plate it half and half in the kitchen for us to share. To finish we ordered dessert, the cookie dough ball. We heard was the best option and we were highly disappointed! No cookie dough, just a hard cookie with an average white chocolate moose cover with a milk chocolate ball, very average and not for a top restaurant. Overall good experience, don't expect high end quality consistency in every dish or the service, that could improve for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Would be five stars But...  I called for window seat four months ago and it honored nor tried to honor.  I know not their policy but could have looked or said a table is about to leave. Want to wait?  Second problem at end of meal. Great service then didn't bring bill. Waited and waited. Food excellent."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and amazing view.  Definitely top 3 restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I would recommend it for special event, business dinner, or just when you want to be reminded what a great restaurant is."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant with great service, the food is just awesome, we went there for my wife's birthday and they treated us so well."}
{"text":"I've been to Altius 3 times now and had a top-notch experience each time. At this latest visit, I had made reservations for a Saturday night at 8:30pm and showed up on the wrong day! I was absolutely mortified when I pulled up my email to confirm the reservation! The hostess was as so kind and understanding.  She worked us in and we were seated promptly at 8:30 near the corner window none-the-less.  It was a packed house and I'm not sure how she worked her magic, but I was so grateful! As always, the staff and food were unparalleled.  We will continue to dine at Altius whenever we want a night to feel special!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view of the three rivers and downtown Pittsburgh with an excellent wine list and wonderful food. We shared the lobster ravioli and the pork chop, both of which were phenomenal. Excellent service and worth every penny. We'll definitely be back for the atmosphere and high-quality food and beer/wine selection."}
{"text":"We celebrated my BF's birthday here and were not disappointed! The ambience is very nice and inviting. Great view of the city no matter where you're seated! We enjoyed the different spin on serving popcorn initially versus bread. (Although the bread came later and they were not stingy whatsoever! Yes!) Our appetizer was presented in a creative way (king prawns) and we enjoyed the different touch on the calamari. (Although the breading could be a touch lighter.) My pork chop dinner was so tender and paired w purple potatoes and carrots/asparagus....delicious! My BF had the duck over polenta w asparagus and he was very pleased. Our waitress was very attentive and paid attention to detail on my reservation. She brought out the perfect size lava cake with berries and whipped cream. It was a great night all around. If you're looking for a classier dining experience, Altius is definitely a must!"}
{"text":"I researched for months before I decided upon Altius for my best friend's bachelorette party. After reading the reviews I thought it would be perfect. As far as views go, I'm not sure that there are better views anywhere in the city. The atmosphere and the views are what got this place two stars. That's where the trouble began. We got to the restaurant at 8pm and there were 9 of us. We got tap water which they said was (quadruple?) filtered. It had a weird fishy taste and it wasn't the least bit cold. It was at least 25 minutes before our server got our order, which was okay at first because we were ooing and awing over the view and drinks came fast. Once we ordered we waited, and we waited, and waited. While waiting, bread service came. They came around a second time and completely skipped two of the guests never asking whether or not they wanted bread. About an hour after we ordered our food it arrived. I had the special which was a deconstructed beef Wellington. It was cold when it arrived. One girl ordered salad with no tomato, it came with tomato. Everyone who got hot food was unsatisfied with the temperature of their food but flavors were there and the presentation was spot on. After eating our plates were cleared. We were given dessert menus. Nobody had dessert. We waited and waited. Waited some more. I had to physically get up from the table and ask about our checks. At least 40 minutes passed between the time that we had our plates cleared and the time that we got our checks. ... then when we finally got our checks, 5/8 checks were wrong. Extra drinks, charges for things that weren't ordered, no drinks on checks for people with drinks. So that was an additional 20 minutes to fix. What makes me upset about this whole deal is that there were 9 of us. We had one server (who had at least one other table). When it came to serve food each person brought out a plate so my question is where were all of these employees when we were waiting and waiting. Could SOMEONE have assisted our server with something to make it less of a wait for us? It's a group so yes it will take longer, I get that but this was completely brimming on ridiculous. I cannot lie when I say that we did not leave Altius until 11:15pm after arriving there at 8pm. It is a fine dining restaurant so I expected some time between and relaxation but we are talking 3+ hours here (imagine if we would have had dessert). I would likely try Altius again just because the view is unlike any other but not with more than 1-2 other people."}
{"text":"I enjoyed our meal and the experience at Altius. We started off with the charcuterie board which was perfect for 4 people. The wine selection was wonderful. All of our meals were top notch. I was surprised how large the portions were and would order less next time. I highly recommend and the views are some of the best over Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"No wonder why this place has such an amazing review ranking! Everything is on time, atmosphere super friendly, such quality service and the food is juuuust so good. Plus the view!!! The view is breathtaking! If you ever in Pittsburgh, visit this fancy restaurant and you won't get disappointed. Would recommend 100%!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for celebratory occasions. It's obviously meant for fine dining. My husband took me here to celebrate my birthday. Lovely place on Mt. Washington with a great view of the entire city. I  believe we got a better view since my husband mentioned my birthday while making the reservation, which we really appreciate. They have a valet service, and we waited at the bar for a few minutes before being seated. The hostess and the waitstaff were very warm and polite.   The food was really good and we enjoyed everything we ordered. I ordered the duck which was quite delicious. Dessert was great too, my husband ordered the chocolate sphere ( can't quite remember the actual name) and it was fascinating. They even gave us complimentary dessert with birthday wishes written on it which was quite sweet. Great place for a date night."}
{"text":"Went here for on a date with my wife. The service was amazing as they kept bringing out delicious bread and were waiting on us hand and foot. We ordered 2 cocktails that took longer than usual but they were perfect and worth the wait. We ordered Carpaccio as a appetizer and it was one of the best I have ever had. I ordered the sea bass which was the best sea bass I have ever eaten. I was in love with it. My wife ordered the scallops which were amazing as well. Food was cooked to perfection and the prices were very reasonable.   Great atmosphere with a beautiful view of the city. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Had another superb meal at Altius.   First off, the service is great.  From our waitress, the bread person, the owner all were very professional and on top of everything without being intrusive.  We received knowledgable help in selecting some wine.   The flavored popcorn starter was fun.  The Imported Burrata with peaches was perfect.  My Lamb Rack was cooked perfectly and came with a wonderful combination of succotash and tomato with a very nice cream.  SWMBO had the Pork Chop that was very good and the left overs were great the next day.  For desert we split the Millionaire Bar that is a shortbread cookie dough with a wonderful dark chocolate and vanilla bean ganache."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Decor: 4 Service: 4  Came here for dinner.  1. Pacific king prawn buttermilk fried green tomato, green goddess aioli, celeriac remoulade, nasturtium, chili threads ~Pretty good. Prawn was cooked nicely, and the green tomato complemented nicely.  2. Crispy lobster spring roll pineapple curry emulsion, morel duxelle, hearts of palm, sesame butter ~Pretty good. Rolls were crispy, and accompanying sauce didn't overpower.  3. Wild Alaskan Halibut cacio e pepe risotto, caramelized PA sweet onions, strawberry and arugula salad, tarragon butter, aged balsamic reduction ~Pretty good. Halibut and risotto were both cooked nicely.  4. Chocolate dessert ~Pretty good. They gave us a complimentary dessert since we were celebrating a birthday.   Service was pretty good, and we had a nice view of downtown since we got a table next to the window."}
{"text":"Came here for my girlfriend because we were visiting Pittsburgh on a whim during thanksgiving weekend. First off, the service is great. This is the first restaurant that had a great view and great food. Usually places with a good location are tourist traps with mediocre food. This place has got it all. We got the ramen for appetizer and it was decent a bit salty and lacking other complex flavors. The main course was much more pleasing my sea bass was cooked well, but it didn't provide any \"wow\" flavors I was looking for. My girlfriends dish was the Berkshire porkchops and it was excellent! It was definitely the winner of the dinner. I would recommend coming here. They gave us great complementary side items like truffled popcorn.   It's a gem in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"First time there was Friday night.  It was good, in fact real good, but I wasn't blown away like some reviewers.  Service was good.  Enjoyed the bread very much.  View is awesome!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for her 10th Birthday.  I know that sounds unconventional to take a child to a fancy restaurant, but that is what she wanted and she is a very adventurous eater.  She is considering becoming a chef someday.  Anyway, we rode the incline (a first for her) up to the restaurant.  I had confirmed our reservations earlier in the day and let them know it was her birthday.  She was greeted by literally every person she saw who worked there (at least 10 people) with \"Happy Birthday!\" which made her feel so special.  The complimentary popcorn, bread, and amuse bouche were all delicious.  I had the honey bourbon cocktail and she had a vanilla soda.  Then we had oysters (another first for her and she didn't care for the texture).  She ordered the ribeye with Brussel sprouts and I had the Amish Chicken.  We ended up trading meals because she wasn't crazy about her steak medium rare (which I obviously knew ahead of time and that is why I ordered the chicken so that we could trade and she would still have a wonderful experience.)  Then they brought her a complimentary brownie with Happy Birthday written on the plate.  We also ordered the chocolate cheese cake which she fell in love with.  They then offered to take her on a tour, including the kitchen.  She met the owner and chef, both women, which was really great for her to experience.  Lastly, they sent us home with what we were unable to finish (the portions here are on the large side) and two complimentary cookies.  In all, this was a top notch experience and a birthday my daughter will never forget.  It was a pretty expensive gift but it was worth it.    My experience in just a few phrases: amazing view, impeccable service, pretty expensive but large portions, wonderful flavor and execution, perfect for a special meal  Only negative thing I could possibly say is that the dimmer switch needs fixed.  The lights dimmed and then increased every minute or so which was pretty distracting."}
{"text":"We used Open Table to book a table and needed to push the time back. The staff was more than accommodating to our request. Upon our arrival we were given a table on the first floor. Not next to the window, but close enough. I have been here before by the window so I've been spoiled.   The complimentary popcorn is to die for. Our server, upon my request, kept it coming throughout my dinner. The only thing working against me was the fact that I was very full very quickly from filling up on popcorn.   After our popcorn we were given a swordfish (I think) sausage as a palette cleanser.   The bread is also wonderful and the butter is equally as good.   I ordered the charcuterie to start. I would definitely recommend this as I genuinely liked each piece on the platter. In addition, I ordered the steak tartare. To which, I was mildly disappointed. It lacked flavor. The presentation was great, but something about the flavor was missing. Having been to the Twisted Frenchman a few nights previous and ordered the same dish, there was just no comparison. Oops.   For my main course I ordered the ribeye special with gorgonzola cheese and veggies. I asked for it to be cooked medium. When it was brought to me the whole thing was grey on the inside. The veggies were also extremely over cooked. I thought maybe I was being too picky so I wasn't going to say anything. The server saw me picking around a bit at it and demanded to bring me a new one immediately. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. The new serving was much more desirable.   For dessert, I had the peanut butter bar with a New York ice wine. It was very rich.   As a parting gift, we were given a cookie bar to go.   4 stars."}
{"text":"There is no doubt the view from this restaurant is spectacular.  One can see the entire Pittsburgh skyline.  I wish I could say the same for the food.  Lots of competing flavors and lots of food.  Can't say that we loved anything.  Be prepared to pay New York prices too."}
{"text":"I really want to like Altius. The restaurant is beautiful, the view is amazing, the service is good. Everything you want before you order dinner. Unfortunately, the menu is needlessly complicated with ill-pairing sauces and unnecessary ingredients. I'm not interested in how many items a restaurant can list on the menu's descriptions. I'd prefer restaurants which execute great taste while practicing restraint from the pantry and spice rack.  Three additional reasons Altius received a 3* rating from me... which I rarely do since many people consider 3* to be poor.  1. Everything was heavily over salted. One diner in our group sent their meal back for this reason. The rest of us dealt with it.  2. No Italian red wines by the glass, in fact their wines by the glass were all together uninspiring.  3. I want to see Altius up it's game. The restaurant can, and should offer better food to accompany the decor and view."}
{"text":"A few things stand out about Altius:  1. Altius does a fabulous job with service. They start off with some complimentary spiced popcorn, an amuse bouche, and some bread, and they finish by giving you a mini-dessert to go in a bag. Sometimes the little things count for a lot.  2. The VIEW. If you get seated near the window, count yourself lucky, because it's probably the best view in Pittsburgh. We came on a clear evening and walked around the sleek dining room to take some pictures while we waited. The restaurant extends into the cliffs of Mt. Washington, and it is gorgeous!  3. The Chilean sea bass. This was my favorite dish of the night by far. Beautifully presented, perfectly prepared, melted in your mouth and went well with all of its complements. I will definitely remember this dish for the next time I come back.  Given both the food and the views/service, Altius deserves 5 stars. :)"}
{"text":"The service staff was the best.  The food is as good as the view from Mt. Washington!  Fresh oysters like you are at the beach.  Seafood stew was amazing and don't pass on the parmesean herb bread with toppings!  Sent us home with homemade brownies in a little paper bag.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular dinner yesterday! I called the restaurant and ask if there was any chance to squeeze us in because I received a surprise gift certificate as a birthday present and was only in town for one more night. The reservations coordinator could not have been more kind and helpful. She suggested I come to the bar and use it there. When we arrive everyone was so generous and ended up arranging a table for us. It was absolutely breathtaking views. The dinner was delicious and each course better than the next. The general manager stopped by to check in on us. Everyone was professional, impeccable hospitality and perfect food. An absolute highlight during our trip to Pittsburgh. Thank you for making my birthday so special."}
{"text":"Meh. Really disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews. Our experience was ok but nothing great and certainly not worth the money. $3 per person for water!! Come on. My husband had a bone in steak special said it was great, my sea bass was also great. Charcuterie app was ok. Overall, food was good, just very overpriced"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weeknight. The restaurant was pretty busy as it was graduation season. There are two levels of seating. We were on the upper level. We were started off with some sour cream and onion popcorn, which was nice to munch on. Then, courtesy of the chef we had an apple with goat cheese and hot honey, which was delicious. They also had a nice selection of breads served with a butter and a red pepper pesto. I had the spinach salad with shallots and mushrooms. For the main course, I had the freebird farms chicken breast. Unfortunately, the chicken breast was pretty dry. The broccolini, purple potato puree, and truffle fondue made up for the dryness. My dad had the ora king salmon and loved it. It was so moist and served with a wonderful broth poured table side.   You must save room for desserts! The presentation of the desserts were incredible. I had the strawberry rhubarb tart, which was nice and light. My dad the milk chocolate ball which was a chocolate cake served in a milk chocolate ball! Overall, a nice fine dining meal to have overlooking the beautiful view of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Pittsburgh! Upscale ambiance with great views of the city. The food is excellent. I got the pork chop, which the server recommended. It was the best I've ever had, and the brussels sprouts were amazing too. My fiance had the sea bass, which was also very good (although he was jealous of my meal). Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Magnicent view! It's on the top of mountain and the view of the city is breathtaking! Very friendly service rendered to customers and gourmet foods are served here. We ordered Chilean Sea Bass and Duck Breast. They are amazing. The vibe is great. Good place to have nice dining experience. I wish they could have little bigger space to accommodate bigger groups. The owners are ladies! I give lots of credit for the efforts they put into the food and the interior design."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! The servers are great, the food is exquisite and the view is phenomenal, day or night!!   They usually have some fun flavored popcorn and three types of bread, all of which pair really well with the butter and sun dried tomato spreads.  My favorite dish here is the duck. And one of my all time favorite dishes that I've had are purple potatoes-they have that as a side dish here too! I love getting the maple bacon Brussels sprouts as well, and since the portions are pretty generous I can always leave with leftovers. The goodie bag dessert is also a sweet treat at the end!!   I love bringing family and friends here for visits and special occasions-a great way to introduce the Pittsburgh dining scene with a great view!"}
{"text":"Great view, of course. That's the easy part. Went on its second night of operation and had a great meal. Service needed work but that's to be expected on day 2. Can't wait to go back again and see how menu changes and how the growing pains have how philly ironed themselves out. Living on the Mt. means having good restaurants is exciting."}
{"text":"World-class view, sublime decor and ambiance, good service, slightly above-average food, meh wine.   Pity the food and beverage quality does not match the venue's."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once, but it was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a very long time. It was my bachelorette party and so I wanted to splurge a little and go somewhere nice. My sister booked the reservation and was insistent that we have a table with a view. It worked. Our table was right on the glass overlooking the city. It was almost dusk and so we were able to see the sunset.   Drinks: very creative and crafty cocktails and the presentation was pretty Service: our waiter was extremely attentive to all our needs and requests, and even came around with bread and a mini dessert. Food: incredible doesn't even cut it. You can tell that the chef has experience- the textures, the presentation, and the flavor balance made the meal mouth-watering (I ordered one of the fish entrees).  Pricy? Yes, but it is so worth the full package that you get. I'd recommend for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The only elevated part about this restaurant is the location.   To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. I didn't make reservations because a.) it was a Thursday b.) my friend was flying in that night so I wasn't positive on what time we would get there and c.) they had multiple openings when I searched. So when we arrived the host (that I greeted) directed us to the bar while she \"figured something out\". After ordering our drinks the bartender asked my friend to take off his hat. He politely said no and explained that he has scars from cancer. The bartender apologized and we continued to wait for a table. We were almost done with our drinks when I saw another couple walk in and get seated right away. I was in ear shot, so I heard them say they also didn't have reservations. I walked up to the hostess and asked how much longer the wait would be. She said the manager would be right with us. A few moments later he came over and told us that they have a dress code which we did not meet. (I guess a hat covering cancer scars and distressed designer jeans were unacceptable.) Then he told us we were ALLOWED to eat at the bar. We of course left and had a delicious dinner at Meat & Potatoes.   I've been to much nicer places all over the world, but I got shunned away at this blue collar town restaurant. The most laughable part was that one of the bartenders had tattoos on his knuckles."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here.  The service was outstanding and so was the food.  Of course, you are also paying for the view, which was beautiful.  I loved watching the sun set over the city.  I would say my only complaint was the lighting after the sun had gone down.  I'm not sure why, but the lights kept dimming and brightening over and over for the last 30 minutes of our meal, which really did become annoying after awhile.  As was expected, the meal was expensive, but that was not a surprise and the quality was definitely there.   The ambiance was great - very modern, nice, clean lines.  We received complimentary popcorn and complimentary bread - three options, that were all delicious and came with herbed butter (it seems like these may rotate?)."}
{"text":"Awesome! I took my husband here for his birthday. I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance via OpenTable. It's cool that they have the people dining on a lower level than those drinking/eating at the bar so everyone has a view of Pittsburgh. It was a clear night so we could see Pittsburgh's beautiful skyline even though we didn't have window seating. You will be stuffed by the time you get your entrees and even more so before you leave with the popcorn and bread to start off before your meals! Nonetheless we ordered the charcuterie to start off with and everything is from local/Amish businesses - delicious and then my husband had the pork chop which was ginormous! and I had the duck which was tenderly cooked, it melted in my mouth with each bite. I wish we had room for dessert because the options looked good but we received a treat to take home from the pastry chef - a piece of toffee bar. Modern vibe which makes Altius standout from the other places on Mt. Washington - a place for something special or a night out on the town!  The only downer was that I called the day of to see if they could accommodate two more people and the person on the phone seemed rude about my question but it might have been that there was a lot going on."}
{"text":"On the recommendation of a friend,my wife and I decided to make a reservation here while we were in town for the US Open. What an excellent recommendation it was. I can't recall being in a restaurant that had better service than this one. The entire staff was friendly and and attentive. IT made our meal extremely enjoyable.   The only thing better than the view of three rivers was the food. We started with the sea scallops which were incredible. I had the Chilean Sea Bass for an entree and my wife went with the beef filet. Both were great.   I would recommend this spot to anyone that likes great food, service and atmosphere. Well done Altius."}
{"text":"My highly recommended visit to Altius met every expectation I could have imagined.    We were treated so royally that I found myself feeling suspicious ...like I didn't realize how special I was to every staff member I encountered.   The view, of course,  is breathtaking, but that goes without saying... And still must be tauted as the number 1 draw.  Everything else you read here will keep Altius at the top of your go to list.   The food was outstanding, I was left wanting nothing!  We ordered dessert just for the fun of it,  but lo and behold... yet another tickle me pink experience when presented with a bronze glistening or that melted molecule by molecule as hot Carmel was gently poured on the orbital.   I'll stop there... But you should know it was a delight I will not soon forget.   Finally,  do not forget to visit the restroom before your departure... I'm not going to release the experience of the secret surprise it holds. Very very cool!!!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular views of the city, beautiful ambiance and excellent seasonal menu. It was just me, so I ate at the bar and had a delicious meal! I started with a lovely Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand and paired that with the Lolla Rossa -- fresh greens with strawberries, ricotta salata, almond tuile, balsamic pearls, orange blossom honey vinaigrette, pink peppercorn ($8). This salad was incredible! So beautiful, fresh, light and layered with so many flavors. Prior to my salad one of the servers brought me a cleansing drink (size of a shot) from the chef. It included fresh strawberries and ginger and was perfect for a summer night. For my main course, the delightful bartender (named Kristy) recommended *Chilean Sea Bass -- saffron lobster couscous, brown butter broccolini, carrot ginger emulsion ($36) and it was incredibly delicious! I avoided the broccolini as my salad was so great and concentrated on the fish and lobster couscous. And then I let Kristy talk me into trying the Peanut Butter Bar -- chocolate flourless cake, peanut praline, peanut butter mousse, candied bacon peanut brittle, frozen banana custard, crème anglaise ($10) and I paired that with a nice Pinor Noir as the dessert is very rich. I couldn't finish the dessert, so I took it home.   Something to note is on Sunday's ALTITUDE stops seating at 9 pm. So go early--about 30 mins before sunset so you can enjoy the spectacular views!  To make your experience even more special, suggest taking the Duquesne Incline up to the restaurant. A one-way ticket is $2.50 per person and a round-trip ticket will cost you $5 per person. And note they only take cash and exact change at that. ALTIUS is located less than 20 yards from the Incline's observation deck.  One more thing to note...they are known for their handmade cocktails!

{"text":"This place was excellent. The view was beautiful, and the staff were unbelievably friendly and personable. The food was delicious. The food pairings were perfectly executed. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Beyond delighted with this restaurant!!!The staff is welcoming and attentive. If you like oysters definitely order the appetizer with a wasabi horseradish and sriracha cocktail sauce. The salmon was delicious! Dessert was a coconut creme brûlée beautifully presented as were all of the dishes. Oh and did I mention the delicious breads and of course the beautiful view of the city!"}
{"text":"Just left this place and can't wait to go back! My party of 7 arrived to a beautifully set table at 6:30. We had complimentary vanilla espresso coffee which was delicious. (They have rotating flavors) Next came the delicious bread. We had rosemary focaccia, wheat sunflower and blue cheese breads served with sun dried tomato pesto and herbed honey butter. Prior to dinner we were treated with an amuse bouche of Mexican spicy hot chocolate. For the entrees, the table had the filet mignon (perfectly cooked), duck breast, gulf shrimp and ravioli. Every one thoroughly enjoyed their meal!   My duck breast was cooked medium rare. The poached pear and walnut mousse paired perfectly with the rich duck.   The service is what stood out. Our waitress was very informative and friendly.  She sent us home with extra packed popcorn since we enjoyed it so much and gave us complimentary pumpkin cookies to take home :)   The view of the city was gorgeous! It's my first time to Pittsburgh and it was a delight to come here. This place is a must try and good for date night or groups!"}
{"text":"The only thing that impressed me more than the atmosphere was the food.   Space: The space has a beautiful, modern design with breathtaking views of the city. We didn't get a window seat, but my girlfriend and I enjoyed the intimate setting of the round booth.  Service: The service was great. There was never a long wait, and the server was friendly.   Food: One of the best meals I've ever had. I'm not a huge charcuterie fan, but it was a nice start to our meal for only $14. I got the pork chop and my girlfriend got the Chilean sea bass. The pork chop was the juiciest, tastiest cut of meat I've ever had. I would recommend this dish to anyone that likes their meat. The Chilean sea bass was cooked to perfection with a slightly crispy exterior.   Price: The food was expensive, but that was to be expected. The city views, a beautiful atmosphere, great service, and excellent food made the meal worth it. We ordered 3 alcoholic beverages, charcuterie appetizer, pork chop entrée, Chilean sea bass entrée, and a side of risotto and our bill was just under $150. I've seen much worse for lower quality food and experience.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place for a birthday dinner!!! It is really hard to believe that this restaurant was once the former Georgetowne Inn. They have free Wi FI and offer valet parking for $6.00.  We knew to expect popcorn as our welcome food. Had to refrain from eating all of it so we could enjoy our meals. I choose the chiliean seabass that comes with saffron Lobster cous cous, brown butter broccolini, and carrot ginger emulsion. My husband opted for the PA Amish chicken breast with corn veloute, purple potato  puree, fried green tomato and gold tomato aiul.  Before our meal we got to sample a small glass of chilled potato soup. It was very creamy and good.  Our waitress brought us a choice of 3 different breads along with accompanying butter or sauce for us to choose from. She was extremely attentive to our needs.  Since we had made a reservation we were able to secure a table by the window. I noticed that if you sit down in this area the dress is business casual. Up a couple of stairs is a bar and seating area where dress is fairly casual.  When our meals were served they came beautifully arranged  My sea bass just seemed to melt in my mouth goodness. My husband's Amish chicken breast also came with a small thigh and leg attached to it. He loved every bite of it.  The portions were just right so we decided to order dessert. I ordered the chocolate cake and he ordered the peanut butter bar. Just before the waitress brought them she brought me a birthday chocolate brownie with whipped cream and fruit with \"Happy birthday\" written on it. It was so good! Had I known this would happen I wouldn't have ordered dessert. However, the chocolate cake did not disappoint. It wasn't a large piece but it came with chocolate sorbet and blueberries which had a zing to it. My husband's peanut butter bar came with a chocolate stick and a caramel bar. He loved every bite of it.  While we were dining the owner came around, wished me a happy birthday, and asked how we were enjoying our meal. I told him we were delightfully pleased.  The place is well lit so we had good interior views as well as exterior.  We settled our bill and as we were preparing to go they gave us a bag with triple chocolate macadamia nuts and sea salts.  This restaurant is very pricey but for us since it was a special occasion well worth the money. I most definitely will return when the occasion warrants it."}
{"text":"This was my first dining experience in Pittsburgh and it was great! The duck was delicious. The fat was rendered expertly. The salmon was cooked to perfection and delicious. The steak tartare was very good but not executed well. The quality of the meat was superb but unfortunately not chopped sufficiently leaving large chunks of meat that I had to gnaw through. In addition the steak was not trimmed properly where several of the pieces of meat were still attached to connective tissue. The bottom layer composed of capers and other savory bits was delicious and provided the perfect acid to balance the richness of the meat. Of course the egg yolk on top made this dish a classic. Overall a good experience. I would consider returning when back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great view, good food with great friends makes a great Friday night. love the charcuterie plates, duck duck goose, and the peanut cake with banana ice cream dessert"}
{"text":"First- we had a reservation for 8:30, and had specifically asked for windows - we were then seated at 8:40, at an awkward table, which did the waitresses no favors (think high end picnic tables). Everyone seemed super disorganized (how does a place this size need 5 hostesses??).    We had to  flag our waitress down to ask to order our food at 9:00- our food didn't come until 10:15. In between we had two watery cocktails (but expensive).  When the food did arrive I expected mouth explosions (after all it took over an hour to cook!)- instead I got a mouth full of salt.  The menu was blah so I ordered the asparagus, polenta and risotto.  All of which had one main flavor- salt.  My friend got the gnocchi-which was less gnocchi and more filler and also really really salty.   This restaurant needs to get their service and food together if they hope to survive and call themselves fine dining.  I certainly won't be back.."}
{"text":"I was very excited to eat here for our first wedding anniversary when I saw the rating for this place and people raving about the great service and food.  The beautiful view is a given being on Mt. Washington.  The food was great! 4/5.  My hubby and I shared the charcuterie bc my hubs is a fan of charcuteries.  This was one of the best I've tasted.  Barbuzzos in Philly is my fave.  I had the sea bass and my hubby ordered the lamb.  They were both delicious and cooked perfectly.  We shared the apple crisp dessert, which was too sweet and too sour not complementing.  That was disappointing because we love our desserts.  Cocktails were just ok.  Tried the dazed and infused and honey bourbon.  I am critical of service when I write my reviews because other than food, it is the only other factor that can set a place apart (IMHO, it is the main factor that makes a difference anywhere, so why not give excellent service?!)  When we got there, the host did not even greet us.  Ok, no biggie, I like being a wallflower anyway, but why would I want to spend money somewhere where I feel unwanted?  Second, not sure if (it's the maitre'd or whoever tells you about your dish) she wasn't nice at all when I asked her to repeat what cheeses were on the plate.  Instead of telling me the names, she gave me a look like why would I ask and dismissingly said oh it's just brie.  It's like implying this expensive plate is nothing special and I don't need to know.  Lastly, my hubby told them it was our anniversary when he made the reservation, but they didn't even acknowledge that.  Not even a verbal happy anniversary.  Because of this experience, I do not recommend this place.  Go to the other Mt. Washington rest that will treat you better.  It's disappointing to me probably because I expected it to be great but my experience was not like other yelpers.  I wish I had it in me to deduct tips for bad service but my hubby and I are taught to give 20% all the time by our parents. Please fix your customer service here. All I can think of is \"rude!\""}
{"text":"Very good restaurant--and the view is amazing.    Have been here several times--I think the food is good, if not amazing, and the service is always very good.  Crowd is pretty cool, and it's easy to get there.    The bar area is great for cocktails.  Totally worth a visit."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday. They had seasoned popcorn on the table, which was tasty. Then had a server offer a choice of three types of bread to eat with a honey seasoned butter or a pesto type sauce. My husband had a cheddar topped focaccia with the pesto and said it kinda tasted like a deconstructed pizza. I had a buttermilk roll with the butter, and while it was good it wasn't anything to rave about. Then they brought out an amuse bouche. I have never had an amuse bouche before but it was pretty good. Then our meals came. I had a steak with vegetables and an aligot. My husband had the halibut. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! Everything was delicious. My steak was cooked to perfection, the vegetables were simple but so good I could have had more, and the aligot is something I would eat all by itself as a comfort food. Everything was so good we basically stopped talking just to focus on the food.  My only criticism was dessert. The waitress warned us that the desserts were deconstructed, but I hadn't realized just how much. I ordered the Black Forest cake and it was basically a dark chocolate ball with cherry chocolate sauce. Three actual cherries, a teaspoon of actual chocolate cake and a half teaspoon of white stuff that I'm not even sure if it was icing or whipped cream. Needless to say I was a bit disappointed and overwhelmed by the amount of chocolate in front of me."}
{"text":"Food gets four stars, service and view get five stars.   Altius nails what so many other upscale establishments miss, that if you're spending upwards of a hundred dollars per person you should be getting phenomenal service. I don't mean like having a butler and the staff grovels, not at all. They are incredibly attentive, polite, never seem rushed to answer a question, and really make you feel comfortable being there even if you feel like a fraud being in a fancy place!   I am completely blanking on our server's name, but she had only been there a few weeks but was outstanding and seemed like she had been working there for years. Made a special night that much nicer.   The view is of course stellar. While most of the pictures you'll see are at night and that is gorgeous, being able to see the breadth of the region in daylight is pretty awesome.   Food was really good. The bread selection they walk around with is off the charts delicious. Cheese plate that was made up for us on request (vegetarian) was great. The saffron spaghetti is good but it would be nice to have more than one explicitly vegetarian option, honestly having two makes the world of difference, doesn't feel like you're being cornered into a choice. I had the special of soft shelled crab and jumbo shrimp, which was delicious. The hollaindaise was a bit salty, but the seafood was top notch.   For other customers: an Under Armour polo shirt is not business casual. Get yourself a ten dollar white button up shirt from Walmart and keep it in your closet for places like this. Golf attire isn't classy, you look like an idiot."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. The environment is young but upscale. The staff is incredibly friendly, and you will not regret any of the drinks you order (the wine list is phenomenal) and the food holds it own. One down fall, on busy nights they do struggle seating you on time."}
{"text":"What can I say but this place is rude, pretentious and not worth anyone's time, my friends and I walked into this place thinking it would be an awesome restaurant to check out but the second we walked in the door we were treated like shit. They basically told us to gtfo because we were in jeans and tshirts. This was at 1pm in the afternoon and all we had wanted was to check it out and grab a drink at the bar (we were also sober af), we get greeted by the hostess and she said \"you guys can't come in here\"?!? What kind of restaurant says that to paying customers? Apparently they learned their hospitality skills from united employees. Not even trying their food or drinks I highly advise anyone that visits Pittsburgh and end up riding the incline they fill find this shithole of a restaurant up top! DO NOT GO THERE unless you wanted to be treated as shit right as you walk in the door!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were both extremely impressed by this restaurant.   We went here the other night after our baby shower since we were already all dressed up and ready to go(a feat for me at about 8 months pregnant).   I was able to easily get an opentable reservation, and being that it was later on a Sunday night they were able to give us a seat overlooking the view on the second floor of the restaurant.   Our waiter was fantastic and very knowledgeable and attentive without being overbearing or making us feel like we were taking too long or keeping him there.   We decided to go all out and ordered a few different courses. First when we were seated our waited presented a three cheese popcorn and offered water.   We were then given an amuse bouche from the chef of winter vegetables and nuts which was delicious.  Our waiter then brought around the bread options for the evening which included a honey whole wheat roll, a piece of rosemary foccacia, or a piece of a Parmesan roll. The first and the last being my favorites. They paired the delicious and warm bread with an herb butter and a sun dried tomato pesto. The staff came by multiple times to inquire if we would like more of the bread.   For our first course my husband ordered the scallop ramen and I ordered the tongue and cheek. The waiter was great and made sure that all parts were alright for me to eat with the baby (he made sure to check multiple items throughout the evening for me before I even had to ask).    Then for our entrees my husband ordered the chilean sea bass and I had the berkshire pork chop. The chilean sea bass was the most perfectly cooked piece of fish I have ever had. The pork was so delicious and wood fired that it didn't even taste like pork, but rather a really amazing steak(in the best way possible) the portion was also enormous and I am happy to report was delicious as leftovers.   Finally we ordered the peanut butter bar. We attempted to also order the caramel apple tart, but they were out for the evening, which ended up being a blessing because we didn't really have room for it. I also indulged in some decaf coffee, which was delicious. The peanut butter bar was delicious and not too heavy after such a delightful meal.   We can't wait to return! The food, service, and ambiance were excellent!"}
{"text":"I'd been here twice for drinks, but was waiting for the right moment to enjoy the food. The right moment came with a tantlizing restaurant week menu!   First, let's talk about ambiance. It's super swank and modern. If you'd ever been to the former restaurant here, The Georgetown Inn, forget about what you remember, because it's nothing like that! Are the views spectacular? YES! Will you be paying for those views? Probably.  So the food. First, you are not only treated to complimentary popcorn, but also complimentary bread. A bread offering that is probably one of the best freshly baked bread assortments I may have ever had! I gluttonous, so I had to try all three... the faccacia, 12 grain and potato roll. All were fabulous. Pair it with the sea salt butter and you're really in carb heaven. Simply incredible fresh bread.   The tasting menu I choose was $39.14 for a three course dinner  First course squash blossom risotto  Second course braised Jamison farm lamb orchiette with zucchini, sundried tomatoes, spinach, sheeps milk ricotta  Third course half baked brownie  The risotto was very good. I think it's hard to not have a bland risotto, and this definitely wasn't. The lamb was to. die. for. Seriously. Cooked medium rare, tender and flavorful. I could have had a little bit more, it was so good! The pasta was good, but there was something missing. I'm not sure if it was the flavoring. It had all the ingredients to be flavorful, and it just wasn't enough for me. Seasoning just didn't do it for me. But was by no means a bad dish.  The brownie is every bit as good as it sounds. I hate when people try to pass off chocolate cake as a brownies. This was a legit fudge half baked obey gooey center brownie. Legit. The bite of my friends cheesecake further convinced me that their desserts are incredible!   Is the food expensive? Yes, but not excessively priced. But I think what really adds up is the wine or cocktails on top of a meal. Their wine list is impressive, and they offer pairings. But just remember, you'll also be paying for the water. Yep. Bottled or sparkling you're charged for. Not sure if you can ask for tap.  But , I think a fancy meal with a lovely view is totally okay once in a while!"}
{"text":"Before giving a five star rating to a restaurant, I dine there twice. After dining at Altius in October and again the week before the New Year I am confident in giving this excellent review.  Perched along the cliff of Grandview Avenue the views of Pittsburgh below are complete with incline, trains, boats and of course cars crossing the bridges and stringing through town.   The city below is stunning.    In addition to a beautiful view the menu and food preparation are first rate. Altius is contemporary in decor with tables spaced comfortably apart. The service is attentive, friendly and efficient.  Both servers during my visits were extremely well informed about the menu and the chef's specials.  While enjoying a pre-dinner drink, a cone of flavored popcorn is delivered to the table.  Also before dinner arrived a shooter of soup was served in tiny glasses.  Deliciously warm on a single digit winter night. During our two visits we have enjoyed the Charcuterie, Salmon, Scallops and Allen Brothers beef.  Each entrée was prepared to perfection and delicious. Accompanying the check was a parting chocolate truffle - a nice touch.  Altius is an outstanding restaurant showcasing excellent food as well as a gorgeous view."}
{"text":"LOVE this place--the food is amazing and the view is spectacular! Been there twice and pleased with everything from the drinks to the service to the awesome food!"}
{"text":"Too often a restaurant with spectacular views will fall short on service and cuisine.  Not the case here!  The experienced and tenured staff are very attentive and professional and the food simply excels!  The newly remodeled dining room is almost as spectacular as the views of downtown, rivers and the stadiums.  Great for a special occasion or business outing.  I will return."}
{"text":"I really tried to find a reason not to give 5 stars, but there simply isn't one! Altius is a wonderful restaurant for a special occasion. They will make you feel like royalty.  My husband and I took my mom here for her birthday. I had called ahead and requested a window seat but they let me know they can't reserve a seat but would do their best. When we arrived, there was no window seating available, but who cared because every seat pretty much has a view of the city! Beautiful space.  Our waiter seated us and promptly explained that we'd be receiving a savory popcorn with lemon butter and poppy seeds. Delicious! By the time the salt in the popcorn had made us parched, our waiter took our drink orders and brought water. I enjoyed a delicious infused vodka with pineapple and habanero peppers, their special house drink of the evening. My mom ordered a Yuengling (which she'd never had!) and my husband got a mojito. He commented at first that it wasn't correctly made, but after his first sip he admitted it was pretty good.  The breads... these alone are a big reason to come here! Before any appetizer or main course you order a server offered us a basket of bread featuring three types: asiago fennel bread, onion chia focaccia and pretzel roll. The spreads were a sweet butter and a finger-licking-good red pepper pesto. We asked for more of the pesto and more bread with our main course, and it was no problem.  For an appetizer, we ordered the charcutterie. Amazing. All locally-sourced cheeses and meats with yummy flatbread and buttered focaccia. More bread! While we were devouring the meats and cheeses, our server surprised us with a wonton-wrapped gnocci seafood treat, compliments of the chef. Another delicious bite!  For our meals, my mom ordered the halibut, my husband ordered the salmon and I ordered the \"Duck, Duck, Goose\". They were both very pleased with their choices, and I couldn't have asked for a more delicious dinner. The creamy creamy goose pâté polenta combined perfectly with the melted leek & pea confit. This is a house specialty and I highly recommend you try it once!  After dinner, our server surprised us AGAIN with a complimentary cheesecake with \"Happy Birthday\" scrawled on the plate for my mom's birthday. Such a nice touch, and delicious, too! It was big enough for all three of us to share.  One more surprise - well two! As we paid the check, our waiter came back with three individually-packed caramel treats in white sacks for us to take home. Who does that?! This restaurant. Then, my husband, who was quite a fan of the focaccia bread and red pepper pesto, asked the server for a small sack for the bread he had set aside. Our waiter disappeared and returned a minute later with a larger sack packed with focaccia and a container of the pesto! We were feeling very thankful at this point for such a lovely night.  I can't recommend Altius enough if you're looking to make yours or someone special's night. The prices are high, but I was expecting that. For the money we spent, the atmosphere, the view, the service, and the food all made it well worth it!!"}
{"text":"We dressed nicely for our 20th anniversary and decided to celebrate at Altius restaurant only to be turned down because my husband wore shorts. He wore a nice summer shirt paired with a equally nice short pants looking rather dapper. We could not believe that we were turned away. We ended up going next door where we were offered a nice patio table with a city view, an excellent meal and drink. Big loss on your end Altius!"}
{"text":"Scheduled my birthday dinner at Altius  6 weeks ago . Me and my husband have recommended this restaurant and have spent thousands of dollars in this establishment . My boys drove in from out of town and we showed up for our 6:45 reservation . We were dressed very appropriately for a Pittsburgh restaurant . We were told that our dress code was unacceptable and we could sit in the bar and not the restaurant , so we left and went to The Grand Concourse . My main complaint is if you have a strict dress policy , please inform your guests about this policy prior to them showing up for the reservation . We received a confirmation phone call the day before . How hard would it be to explain that everyone must be in pants ? Didn't happen . I was looking forward to this dinner for weeks . I thought my birthday was ruined , but Grand Concourse was excellent . Your hostess was rude and didn't care that our plans were ruined . Will never recommend this place again and will never be back . Bad customer service and experience . Oh well , they lost $400 dollar ticket and Grand Concourse earned it !"}
{"text":"I was very excited to get to try this place! We came here on a Saturday night for dinner to celebrate a birthday. They won't guarantee window seats, but as others have said, each floor of the  restaurant is pretty small, so you have a nice view from any table. We however, somehow lucked out and scored the corner table!  I had very high expectations for the food here, and while it was good, it didn't quite live up to the hype.  I started with the lobster bisque, which was delicious! It's all puréed so it's very smooth and creamy without any chunks chunks of lobster. As my main I had the duck. I really liked the sides that accompanied it, but the duck itself was tougher and less flavorful than I expected.  I found the food here to be very heavy, and not in a pleasantly full way, but more of a I never want to eat again way. My dinner partners felt the same, so much so that none of us had room for dessert, and we ALWAYS have room for dessert.  Nevertheless, as we were celebrating a birthday, they brought out a lovely plate of chocolate and truffles. Definitely tell them if you are celebrating an occasion!  Overall, the view is amazing and the service is top notch. The food is very good, but for the price I would have expected it to be better. If I were to go back, I would likely skip the appetizers (or at least share with someone), order a different main, and try out their dessert menu"}
{"text":"So glad I had my moving-out-of-Pittsburgh-farewell dinner here! I went the summer of 2013 and am writing a review now just because this place stood out in my mind - I had to share how awesome it is. I think I went within the first couple of Altius opening and so I had the privilege of chatting with the owner and head chef. Both were very nice and accommodating.   Bread and a fancy little \"vase\" of popcorn came out as soon as we sat down. We happily munched as we enjoyed the view, which was gorgeous, but that goes without saying - I mean we are sitting on Mt. Washington looking down at the Pittsburgh downtown skyline - simply breathtaking.   We then got comp zucchini fritters - this was probably my favorite thing out of our whole meal! The bite was just so delicious! The rest of the food was good too - especially the charcuterie board - this is a must try here!   Overall, Altius is one of the top foodie spots you should definitely hit up!"}
{"text":"Every time we go in thrilled with everything except the main course. That being said, the ambiance is lovely and I can't think of a better place for cocktails. I think the small plates are always best when you have a chef that loves creating flavorful sauces. It makes the entire dining experience such an adventure.  There are two floors to the establishment. I've never been seated on the first but the second is quite and cool. the view is spectacular, by far one of the best in the city."}
{"text":"Awesome high-end experience and accommodating staff! We had an amazing anniversary dinner here and as far as restaurants with a view go, I actually prefer Altius to Le Mont."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner a few weeks ago and must admit i wasn't overly impressed. The decor was chic and modern; but the lighting was off. The lights kept flickering which made you feel like you were in a bad disco.  The tables were spaced nicely, so it didn't feel like you were on top of the table next to you; however, I will absolutely express my unhappiness with my seating arrangement. We were sat at the only table that required you to sit side by side, not across the table like most are use to. i felt completely disconnected from the person i was dining with because we were talking to the side of each others face. I understand that some people like that setup, but i do not. It completely ruined my experience here. I'm not blaming Altius, but it was a horrible night to go to a Mt. Washington restaurant because the view was masked by a thick cloud of fog.  The wait staff was really kind and attentive. I ordered the only vegetarian option on the menu and honestly have no clue what the chef was thinking when s/he concocted it. I ordered the Cauliflower steak with cauliflower puree and pickled cauliflower. Certainly there are other vegetables that could have been incorporated that would've went along better. i love cauliflower, but a cauliflower trifecta was not satisfying."}
{"text":"The food was so salty I had to wake up three times to drink water at night.  Complimentary chives butter spread was maybe 50% salt and the rest was butter and chives. Complimentary bread was below average. The dried aged rib eye was fantastic!! It was the best of the night, tender, flavorful and delicious! I'd give it 4.7 stars.  But the carrots with the steak were again extremely salty. My partner in food ordered the Chilean sea bass. She liked it but reported it was salty. I tried the saffron lobster couscous and it was interesting and tasty.  When I told the waitress that the food was so salty, she told me they're aware and they have been hearing about this lately. I say you better stop adding salt before you hurt some guy with a heart condition.  Another thing, although we asked for a table with a view twice , we weren't accommodated. There was an available table with a view but the maître d' didn't allow.. She was rude and bossy although we were asking very kindly.   Too bad!!  I came here preparing for a 5 stars experience based on the great reviews. But due to the excessive salt on many items and no accommodation for the seats with a view, it had to be chopped to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant on all counts. Food was beautiful and fresh. Portion sizes were more than ample. Combinations were thoughtful, unique and modern. And, most importantly, everything tasted delicious. The price was quite reasonable for an upscale restaurant and service was friendly without being the least bit intrusive."}
{"text":"Went here 1 month ago to celebrate J's birthday. We had such an amazing experience here! The view from our table was great. Everything that we ordered was delicious. We had the charcuterie to start, which was filled with three cheeses, three meats, peppered pickles, focaccia bread, and the most delicious pure honey and apricot spread I've ever had! We were also give the choice of three different types of bread, whipped butter with chives, and real sundries tomatoes. Delicious! J ordered the flat iron steak and I had salmon. To die for! For dessert, J received a complimentary brownie with raspberry sauce and whipped cream for his birthday. I ordered the chocolate dessert which came with marshmallows, homemade thin mints, and a chocolate and mint sauce inside the chocolate lava cake. Here's the kicker: everything was placed in a cup completely made of dark chocolate. *dead*. This is definitely our new favorite spot and we will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Great food and great service. The atmosphere is beautiful with a spectacular view of gorgeous Pittsburgh! From the popcorn on the table to dessert it was memorable."}
{"text":"I recently celebrated here with my boyfriend, and the dinner experience did not disappoint.  First, the view is incredible.  I enjoyed seeing the twinkling lights of Heinz Field and downtown Pittsburgh from the panoramic windows.    The food is outstanding.  Not only do you get incredibly fresh and unique dishes, the chef sends out complimentary snacks throughout the dining experience.  These little touches plus the server's attention to detail put this restaurant over the top.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food great service had to wait 20 minutes, had an 8:30 got there a little early. Other than that the duck duck was so good, wife had the halibut and that was awesome. Drinks, desert and service were great!!"}
{"text":"We booked a reservation at Altius for our anniversary and it was well worth it. Everyone we interacted with was kind and helpful, from the valet, to the hostess, to our waiter, and the manager who came to check on us throughout the meal.   When we sat down, they came over with a complimentary cone of truffle popcorn to start, and it was so good. We then ordered 2 glasses of red wine that were both delicious. We started off with a charcuterie board that had 3 different meats, 3 cheeses, 3 mustards/sauces, breads, and pickled veggies. But before that was ever brought to our table we received a sample of the chefs tasting for the evening, and I couldn't tell you what it was, but it was great. After that, I ordered the shrimp and scallop bouillabaisse and my boyfriend ordered the strip steak. We both were very pleased!   We skipped dessert but our server brought us  2 complimentary mini to go bags with a little blondie type dessert bar inside when she brought the check and wrote \"happy anniversary\" on them. All the little touches like this made us feel special and we agreed it was a great place to celebrate our day.   Last but definitely not least..that view of the city. I could have stayed and stared at it all night. It's beautiful! Our table was on the second floor right by the window and it was gorgeous."}
{"text":"What an amazing place ! I had the grass fed steak, cheesecake and scallop ramen . It was absolutely divine. Service was amazing ! Decor , amazing , outstanding staff , pristine. Epitome of 4-5 star dining ! Will be coming back !"}
{"text":"The view! Was in town for a meeting and even though it was about 25 minutes from where we were staying it was worth the trip. No reservations and a group of five,  the staff was very accommodating.      We ordered a few appetizers and a meal each. We did not know that the restaurant gives you a few on the house starters. Needless to say we were all pretty full by the time we left.  Starters - Charcuterie, the calamari and lobster bisque  Main - the pork chop   Beautiful view with great food!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to Altius for her birthday.  They gave us the best seat in the house, and the service was amazing.  At most fancy restaurants, it's easy to feel like you may not have gotten your money's worth.  That was not the case here.  The portion sizes were more than satisfying.  I would highly recommend to anyone considering a dinner night in Mount Washington."}
{"text":"We ate here for a belated Valentine's Day dinner.  The view is by far one of the best (if not the best!) in the city.  The food was delicious but I hoped for more flavor in a few of the dishes.  From the bar staff to the coat check everyone was professional and courteous.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and had great personality.  Every question we had concerning the menu and her personal recommendations on certain items were answered without hesitation.  We were a little early so we had two dirty Ketel One martinis at the bar.  They were perfectly made with the correct ratio of olive juice.  For appetizers my fiancee had the chilled oysters.  They came with pear migonette and horseradish and she said they were delicious.  I did not try them.  I had the Heron Point Crab Toast.  It was reasonably sized and full of flavor.  I recommend it.  For a main course she had the Hokkaido Scallops.  She said they were great but as a man I would have wanted a larger portion.  She said the noodles under the 4 scallops were just average.  I had the filet with gorgonzola, buttered green beans and carrots with truffle potato gratin.  The filet was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I would have liked the gorgonzola melted slightly more but it was still great.  The vegetables were also a delicious side with the butter they used.  The potato gratin however was lacking.  There was very little truffle or raclette flavor.  This was a disappointment since I was looking forward to this dish.  For dessert she had the PBC.  She said it was a perfect dessert (for a peanut butter lover) and the presentation was outstanding.  Overall it was a great dining experience with better than average cuisine.  The atmosphere and view make up for the minor items I mentioned above.  We will definitely be going back."}
