{"text":"Came here with a large group expecting the restaurant to be a Mexican restaurant.  Pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of menu items. Tried the fig and goat cheese pizza and found it to be outstanding.  The entire party enjoyed their meals and I heard no complaints."}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean food, lovely setting, but high staff turnover is causing service issues. If they can figure that out, a lot of problems will disappear."}
{"text":"Wow, out for our Wedding Anniversary and these guys ruined it. Quickly seated, but after waiting for 15 min for our server to come by we left. Not busy and we get treated this way. Never again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I attended a Spanish Wine Tasting dinner here.  It was my first time dining here, his second.  Our meal and entire experience was absolutely fabulous.  We are so thrilled to have such a top notch restaurant right in our neighborhood shopping center.  The d√©cor is rustic elegant and the place has a great vibe.  They had live music the night we were there and the bar was packed--even on a Wed. night!
Our meal was one of the best I've had in Charlotte.  The lamb shank should not be missed if you like lamb.  It's the most tender I've ever had.  The wait staff is professional, attentive and excellent--- a real plus for me because I feel service in Charlotte is just ok overall.  Ilios Noche servers are definitely a cut above.  I recommend this for a casual lunch/dinner with friends/family or a special occasion dinner or lunch.  Look no further for a great Mediterranean meal."}
{"text":"It seems like your neighborhood Italian or Greek restaurant -- except that it is much prettier inside and the food is much much better.  I had the petite bistro steak, which was perfectly cooked to order, and was graced with an amazing aged balsamic.  My wife raved about her ravioli and mushrooms.  Our dinner companions enjoyed their lamb chops and chicken lemonata.  The dessert menu attributes their choices to their own pastry chef, and they also were excellent.  Service was prompt and attentive.  There is nothing about this place not to like."}
{"text":"I was part of a large party at Ilios Noche tonight and given the amount of food we ordered, the restaurant handled things well: An affable server explained unfamiliar food (a mix of Greek and Italian dishes), our food came out at proper temperature and (except for one order) timing was perfect. 

Standouts included thin slices of octopus dressed with olive and sided by red onions and lamb bolognese in Moussaka. Mmmm."}
{"text":"great tasting lamb; even better appetizers! would definitely visit again--even at this pricepoint! only negatives include noisy ambience."}
{"text":"Great food! Nice servers and quick service. Their octopus app. dish is delicious. Their cocktails I'm not too crazy about but the have a full bar. Elegant for a date as well as great for a dinner with girl friends or a business meeting even. Great lunch and dinner spot. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious as usual. 
We had the taste of all spreads hummus app (the roasted red pepper spread is amazing) and calamari (served with marinated olives-yum).

I couldn't pick a favorite with the four entrees that were ordered at our table. The veal piccata melted in your mouth, the lamb shanks were cooked to perfection , and the capellini pasta served with scallops and prosciutto was something I would order and I don't love to get pasta out. I ordered the pork ribs which were the biggest portion and came out steaming hot, falling off the bone...and that seasoning! I also can't get enough of the Greek fries they serve with many of the entrees, including the ribs. 

Somehow, we saved room for a few bites of dessert: the Baklava is to die for with figs, cinnamon, and some vanilla-caramel ice cream.   

I am never disappointed with Ilios Noche and can't wait for my leftovers tonight!"}
{"text":"Very nice food. Very good service. Excellent experience. Lamb chops and braised lamb are really good. Wine and appetizers are good."}
{"text":"It's been about three weeks, but I do remember the food was great.  I had a lamb burger with goat cheese that was awesome."}
{"text":"Great Place, cool environment, solid food.  One thing.............Who serves Wheat Pita bread with tzatziki sauce!!!!!  Numerous customers have requested at least the option of regular pita bread.  Seems like a quick fix to me, can't figure out why management won't offer what 99% of the other Mediterranean restaurants do."}
{"text":"Have been to Ilios a handful of times. I went last night and it has definitely gone down hill. The ceasar salad was below average. I then ordered the Ravioli and Mushroom dish and it was lacking taste with enough cream to feed a small village. My wife ordered the vegetable soup and it was so spicy she just took two bites. My daughter got the Calameretti (sea scallops, gulf shrimp, whitefish, octopus, saffron-tomato broth) - the dish smelled way too fishy and was in a thick tomato paste. Definitely not a broth. At this point would guess we don't go back unless hear from friends that it's back on track..."}
{"text":"This place didn't live up to the rave reviews. Went there this weekend for a quick pizza. First off I'd like to say that the staff was very attentive and the owner himself came over to say hello. It turns out that his family goes to the same church we do. 
The server was very attentive and asked how our meal was and also refilled our soft drinks so the service was not the issue, the food just didn't live up to the expectations we had due to the rave reviews our friends had for the place. It was very disappointing. The pizza had no taste and the crust was burnt on the bottom and it didn't taste like it had baked all the way through. We will try again because maybe the chef had a bad night. This was not a good impression at all."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding.  Food was tasty.  Best lamb burger I've had in a while.  I will be back next time in Charlotte.  Exceptionally nice touches in service - they gave us free dips and divided up our salad. Service was very prompt and friendly.  Impressive menu."}
{"text":"Went with a diverse group, adults and kids.  Menu is diverse, with good options for everyone.  Our server Daniel was top notch.  Food portions were plentiful, very fresh, and delicious.  The live music on outer Saturday night added a nice soothing atmosphere.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ilios Noche has quickly become our favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  You wont find better service or more delicious food anywhere. Anthony continues to impress with his wine recommendations.  

This place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow! Such a great atmosphere and guest experince..but honestly the food is FIRE! One of the best grilled octopus I've ever had. My husband had the lamb chops and they were perfectly marinated and grilled to excellence. Go and see the lovely people at this great restaurant. 6 stars"}
{"text":"Popped in here for a bite while in town on business and it was excellent! Spinach pie was freshly made and delicious. Ilios salad was perfectly dressed! Hit the spot! Well done"}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch today at Ilion today. Unfortunately they were out of lamb, but the salad and pizza were perfectly prepared. Service was excellent also. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is always awesome, zucchini chips!! 
But, having great service is Key to a successful dining experience 
SIMONE..and her support staff ( server assistant)  made everything 
Great! Ask for SIMONE and you be will be in good hands!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned spot!  Food is always fresh, spiced right and reasonably priced.  Not a bad item on the menu!  
It's in a strip mall... so, not the greatest location... small and about ready for an update.  But, the atmosphere inside is nice.  You've gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi guy, however, when I'm not eating sushi there are two restaurants that I think have the best food pound for pound in Charlotte. One is Roosters and the other is this place. Exceptional service and amazing food. They are people that care and you can tell that once you dive into your food. I highly suggest trying this place! We need more quality places like this in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places in the Ballantyne area that's worth the drive - especially if you live closer into town. While it's not advertised as a Greek restaurant, it's the only traditional/legit Greek place in town.

Appetizers
Taste of all Spreads (Hummus, Tzatsiki and Greek eggplant dip) a phenomenal starter and very generous portions
Grillled Sausage - the sausage and the sauce are ridiculously good and the foccacia they serve with it is perfect to help clean the plate.
Lamb Souvlaki - melt in your mouth good - you can make a meal on appetizers alone.

Main
Garganelli with Chicken and Crazy Lasagna are my favorite pasta dishes...though I have to admit that I lean toward the Greek stuff, so havn't ordered pasta here in awhile
Moussaka - I don't like Moussaka but this has delicious, complex flavors and is enough for two.
Lamb Shank/Lemon Chicken - when I'm in my Greek mode - both well done and remind me of my mom's cooking

Desserts
Frank (on of the two Kaltsounis brothers) is a great pastry chef, and the Loukomades and Rice Pudding are both as good as you would get in Greece.

All-in, Ilios Noche does a great job...awesome wait staff....timiing of courses...etc. My negatives are the parking...and the fact that it's a mess getting there with all of the construction, but not their fault...and the fact that  the last two dates I've taken there have both been failures (it couldnt't have been the food...must've been the company) :-)"}
{"text":"this is one fantastic place. very modern and different Greek foods and some with a twist. their Greek style ribs are to die for..fall right off the bone and with tzatziki to dip in on the side (easily my favorite food) I really enjoyed. my sister had their lamb bolognese over raviolis special and we were astonished at how good it was. definitely will be trying some lamb in my homemade next time! only downside and my reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is the location. it's 20 minutes outside Charlotte and in a shopping center so not that charming."}
{"text":"Loved the food as always but the service was GOD AWFUL!!!!  We had a party of 8 and one of us never got her dinner.  It was like pulling teeth to get anything to our table.  By the end of the meal, we were all so disgusted.  I did take the time later to write the manager to let him know of our disappointment because I beleive they can do better."}
{"text":"I've just eaten at this restaurant for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised by the amazing food this place has. 

When I first entered the place I was overwhelmed by the amount of loud wine-drunk people packed into a relatively small space. My girlfriend and dad were with me, and being a few of the only people there strictly to try the food, the obnoxiously drunk table next to us left a pretty bad first impression. This is to be expected on a Friday night, though, so we huddled together in conversation while we read the menu. 

My girlfriend and I love Mediterranean food so we had the anxious pleasure of having to pick one meal out of so many great options. We ended up picking the same thing for once and were not disappointed.

The waiter brought out some amazing bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar which was definitely not the cheap stuff. We contemplated just eating round after round of that for dinner but we had already ordered entrees so we might as well eat those too.

For dinner we both had the Livornese. The ingredients (including the pasta) were fresh and the flavor was incredible. Sometimes something is so good that my girlfriend and I end up staring at each other shaking our heads in agreement and then proceed to grunt and moan shamelessly while slowly eating. This was one of those times.The table next to us didn't seem to mind after all. We were in awe with no regrets.

Go eat here, it's amazing.

Although I would like to try this place when they are least busy. If anyone who works there is reading this, when are you the least busy?"}
{"text":"We have been driving by this place and talking about it since we first moved to Charlotte. Today we finally stopped in for lunch. This now ranks, in our opinion, as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. We can't believe it took us so long to try it but know it won't be long before we eat here again. They have vegetarian and vegan options. It's very clean and the staff were courteous, neatly dressed, and respectful. The food was delicious!!!! I can't wait until we go back."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say the quality of food has really declined over the past couple of years. My trout was OK but nothing special. A lamb burger was overloaded with onions. And a vegetarian meal was really second rate."}
{"text":"Great spot. Great atmosphere, wait staff, and of course food!  I tried the Crazy Lasagna and ordered the large so I would have lunch the next day. It was so good I ate the whole thing. The restaurant is a little pricy but a great place for a special dinner."}
{"text":"Our friends recommended this place and made a reservation on a Saturday evening for all 8 of us.  We were seated right away and I was glad to see a good selection for the kids menu.  My oldest ate all of his salmon and asparagus meal (that alone means 5 stars).  My husband also really loved his halibut meal as well.  I think what impressed me the most was the service at this place.  Our friend ordered a Dr Pepper but they didn't have Dr Pepper so the owner went next door and got it for him.  Next my little guy accidentally spilled his chocolate milk and the owner offered to make a new pizza for us.  I couldn't take him up on that kind of generosity but it was much appreciated.  The kids were actually well behaved so we had a great time.  I will be going back here soon!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here! Creative menu and reasonable prices. Good atmosphere, can get a little noisy. Generally attentive staff. My personal favorites are the flatbreads and the scallops"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants.  We went there for our Valentines Day dinner and everything we ordered was better than we would have ever expected.  Our waiter was very nice and was very helpful with all of our questions.  Atmosphere was very pleasing.  I would have never thought I would have found this little gem in a strip shopping center.  We will definitely be going back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for dinner.  Food was very good. The decor is much better than in most american restaurants."}
{"text":"I had the lamb and it was excellent. My friend had the chicken and loved it. A little pricy but the food is very good. Our server was very nice and took very good care of us. There was enough food on my plate to take enough for another meal. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today.  Johanna was our waitress.  I have never seen her before and eat there quite frequently.  All I can say is \"Wow.\"  She is top notch in every way.  She radiates friendliness.  Plus she is an excellent server.  I will be sure to request her next time.  The food, as always, was great.  Today's special was cream of cauliflower soup.  I have never had that before.  It was the best soup I have ever eaten.  Delicious!   They should put it on the menu."}
{"text":"Recently tried out Ilos Noche and I was very impressed.  Definitely a great place for date night or even GNO!  I had a chicken pasta which was amazing.  They also had a great wine list.  I loved the atmosphere and bar area.  I would 100% come up and have a few drinks at this bar, seems like a happening place.  We also went on a Saturday night and they had live music! A must try if you haven't been!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  They're doing something right because the place was packed.  Glad we had reservations.  We actually tried to push back our reservation, but there were very few options other than a VERY late dinner.

Food:  Good, but nothing outstanding.  We ordered the goat cheese marinara app, which was tasty, but the goat cheese portion was smaller than the size of a ping pong ball.  Won't order this again.  I ordered the crazy lasagna, which is basically what standard lasagna would look like if you cut a brick out of a large pan and then dropped that brick into a bowl.  It's lasagna all mixed up and not neatly stacked.  The portion size was perfect, maybe even too much and I came ready to eat.  I enjoyed the dish, but it certainly wasn't memorable for its taste.  My wife ordered the veal marsala - she made similar comments.  Good but not great.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes, because, like I wrote above, Ilios Noche was the place to be on Saturday night.  

Service:  Our waiter was great when we saw him.  For most of the meal he was appropriately attentive, provided great input on the menu and wine list.  However, as our meal progressed, he became more and more non-existent.  Took a LONG time to get our check at the end of the meal.  I'll give him a pass since the place was so crowded - maybe he had more tables than he could handle, maybe he took a smoke break, etc.  Whatever.

Atmosphere:  I heard complaints about the tables being almost on top of each other so that they could cram more parties in at one time, but I didn't really notice that.  Additionally, we were sat at a two person booth.  Perfect for us.  This place is extremely loud, though.  I had a rough time hearing my wife from across the table and she's not exactly know as a soft speaker :)"}
{"text":"OMG!!! An amazing food experience!! Phillip was our waiter with great suggestions. We had the fried calamari as appetizer, the signature lamb dish and risotto Parmesan. The ambiance, service and food 5 stars. Definitely a must for fine dining."}
{"text":"Let's just say that Ilios Noche isn't all that \"great.\" I use these unnecessary quotation marks because it seems fitting for this place trying to be both a \"Greek\" restaurant and an \"Italian\" restaurant, and uses quotation marks indiscriminately across their menu (except where they are needed). 

For instance, some of the sandwiches come with \"Greek fries\" (as written online), and on the menu, Greek \"fries.\" Needless to say I wasn't interested in sampling quasi-fries of any nationality. But, on the contrary, the Wood Grill section is not in quotes, although our waiter informed us, after we asked what wood was used in the grill, that there isn't really a wood grill at all. Yes, here was a legitimate opportunity to use quotation marks: \"Wood Grill.\" 

I did very much appreciate our waiter's honesty and friendliness, and a waiter without much confidence in his place of work does speak volumes on its own.

But let me start at the beginning. Ilios Noche's al fresco dining is next to the Harris Teeter's supermarket parking lot, so you're really seated next to a mini van and souped-up BMW thoroughfare. Yes, there aren't many real estate options in this area, so this is unavoidable, but I think they should be more honest about the location on the web site for those to which this arrangement is...unexpected.

It was half-price martini night when we dined there, and that can potentially put a good spin on even the worst situations. I was blindly optimistic.

We shared the combo dip platter, which was not bad--four greek spreads with pita (red pepper and feta and the yogurt spread were the best, the hummus seemed made with dehydrated garbanzos). We also split the Grape and Fennel salad, which wasn't bad either: the right amount of dressing with shaved fresh fennel, grapes, spinach and unfortunately--cooked figs (think fig newton filling). 

Despite my second martini, the entrees were barely edible. My friend had salmon that was cooked well but paired with some kind of salty faux \"tomato onion marinara,\" and my Spanakopita (not called this but that's what it was trying to be) was shaped like a curled up soft pretzel, heavy on the spinach and very very very light on the cheese. We also sampled the Gulf shrimp souvlaki, which should have been in quotes since there was no \"souvlaki\" anywhere in sight--just tough, slightly smelly shrimp on skewers that were left on the plate when we departed.

I was going to ask about dessert before the entrees came (perhaps that was the martini talking), but the cheque came before I could. I was considering espresso until the man at the table next to us asked the waiter about it and the waiter replied: \"Uh, our espresso machine...\" and the man completed the sentence: \"Sucks?\" Waiter: \"Uh, yeah.\"

Perhaps he should have used air quotes when saying \"espresso machine.\" Given that there really wasn't any wood grill, it's hard to believe there's any espresso machine at all.

I know there are not many options if you're staying or living around this area, so if you come here, revel in the large portions and stick to the very very \"Basic\" menu items. Oh, and drink some martinis with dinner. Or, as it were, more \"martinis.\""}
{"text":"We had a very good dinner here, the octopus appetizer was especially tasty.  Brought the family and the in-laws and we were all very happy with the food and service.  My notoriously light eater son finished almost his entire pizza, it was that good.  I recommend calling ahead as the place can fill up during peak times.

Very good greek food, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Make reservations!  This place is what our little hood in CLT has needed for years and gets packed by 7."}
{"text":"WE had booked our holiday party 6 weeks ahead for 13 at Ilios and all were really looking forward to it. They had a hostess call less than 2 days before the party to let us know that they couldn't accomodate us. First they said it was a \"management function\" and then changed the story that someone else booked the room. They did not offer any other accomodations in the restaraunt to make up for this oversight and have left us without a place to hold our party! Very poor customer service- not acceptable!"}
{"text":"Ilios Noches not only has excellent authentic Mediterranean inspired  food but they have excellent service and enthusiastic customers. I love their vegetarian selections as well as their meat and seafood. My teenage son went recently with a group and they were treated like royalty and made to feel very special. I am so lucky that Ilios Noches is right down the street from me. It is great for both lunch and dinner! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Our first visit and we loved it. Lydia was a gracious attentive waitress. The Taste of Spreads appetizer was my favorite. Can't wait to come back and try something different"}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a try. I must say I was very impressed. My server was very pleasant and attentive. I tried the house seasonal salad which was delicious! I'm glad I was able to consume my appetizer before my shrimp pasta entree came to the table nice and hot! To finish it all off, a decadent flour-less chocolate torte with a sweet and creamy marshmallow ice-cream. This item wasn't even listed on the dessert menu but my server Noel recommended it. She is Awesome by the way. ;) I know I will be back soon. Happy Hour 4-6 Mon-Fri."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try. The place was quite busy. Calamari is good. Seabass is perfect. Yum yum! Baklava is a little different from what I had in Turkish restaurant. Overall, recommend this place."}
{"text":"We love us some Greek food.  Craving some gyros, we headed to Ilios Noche last weekend to get a good dinner and a few glasses of wine. We were really excited based on all of the awards they had won in the last year.

The menu looks incredible - especially the appetizer selection. We were very excited to order.

We approached the hostess stand and asked to be seated, the phone rang and she proceeded to leave us standing there while she took down a to-go order.... meanwhile, I'm trying to balance on crutches with an air-cast on my leg. She later apologized, which was nice of her, so we just let that go. Whatever.

We ordered the baked feta, and it came to us completely cold. Maybe it was supposed to be served that way, but that isn't what we were expecting.

My husband had half a glass of cab left in his glass, and the server walked by and poured some of our bottle of malbec in his glass, wasting what was left of the cab and a bit of our malbec. 

I was very surprised to see that there were no actual gyros on the menu. They have a similar thing but it comes with marinated cubes of lamb, which was kind of a bummer, but it didn't actually say \"gyro\" on the menu, so we can't complain.

My husband also asked for a few things to go with his salad that never came.

The final verdict: We weren't impressed by the service,  but we might come back and try other menu items. They have a great wine list (try the Malbec!), lots of food choices, and some of the food descriptions sounded amazing. Just don't come if you're craving gyros, there aren't any."}
{"text":"The place is nice, ambience is nice and if you are sitting at the bar to order food, service is just normal.

But to talk about the main thing which a restaurant sells - this place is below standard. Factors taken into account to rate the food - taste, presentation, authenticity, price. So this is supposedly a Greek, Mediterranean and Italian restaurant. 
We ordered, a simple lamb pita, a chicken pita and zucchini and egg plant fried appetizers with tzazsiki. The appetizer had too much salt in it. The tzazsiki had garlic missing in it and the taste could've been anything from ranch to mayo to Greek yogurt - unfortunately it's not tzazsiki. The lamb in the lamb pita was dry, with none of the tzazsiki or garlic flavor in it. It was like using a week old lamb in a pita bread. It was the same problem with the chicken pita. Overall it wasn't Greek or Mediterranean food. Probably this may also come as a surprise to many of you that the food wasn't that good, because a lot of people (majority of people here) don't know what's good food , or rather what is authentic food. But of course they think they know, that's an even bigger problem. Nothing against anybody, but if I am going to a Greek, Mediterranean or Italian restaurant I will look for authenticity. Americanising cuisine isn't an excuse. I tasted better pitas from a food truck. So paying this much for this quality of food is undesirable. Oh yes I have tasted Greek food in Greece and Italian food in Italy, so I know what I am comparing with. I don't expect 100% authenticity, but it could've been at least a little better."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with live music excellent service staff
Must try  sea bass and good job to our waiter Josh"}
{"text":"Brunch on Sunday absolutely delicious! The spinach pie to start was warm and tasty! The lamb burger was so good! Really fresh, tons of flavor! Defiantly would recommend this place! Next time we're in town we will come back, so much more on the menu to try!"}
{"text":"1-21-2017.  7:30 reservation for party of six for birthday celebration.  8:30 still waiting for table???"}
{"text":"Went to Sunday brunch here yesterday. The chicken and waffle sandwich was really delicious. I enjoyed all three of the dipping sauces that came with it (hot sauce, honey and lingen berries). Added Applewood bacon to it which made it even more delicious. They have tasty grits for a side as well. Really beautiful ambiance and our server Brandt was awesome! Definitely want to check out dinner here sometime."}
{"text":"Always a wonderful meal.  Perfect bistro atmosphere, excellent service and delicious dishes prepared with only the freshest ingredients.  A very friendly atmosphere is created by the wait staff and management alike; they make you feel special.  This is our neighborhood and we're delighted to have Ilios Noche so close.  We will be back often."}
{"text":"Let me first say that it is so nice to see new diversity in dining at Quail Corners.. I've lived in the area on and off for over 22 years and to see the place get a face lift after that long, and new shops is a very welcome change.

After an afternoon shopping with my mother, we decided to eat here for a rather late dinner, around 9:00. Knowing that many dining establishments in the area close around that time, our hopes were feeble in finding a good meal at this hour. Fortunately, Ilios Noche doesn't close until 10:30 on Saturdays, and we were welcomed by the hosts with a smile. We were seated rather quickly, after a ten minute wait. Our server was immediately attentive, but left us feeling a little rushed to decide what we wanted to eat. Having never been here before, I asked her for a few recommendations and a few more minutes to decide.

While reading the rest of the menu options, we ordered a round of local beers (they offer several) and  the taste of four spreads to start our meal. They included a roasted eggplant spread (similar to babaganoush), hummus, red pepper spread, and tzatziki, served with warm pita bread. We all decided that the eggplant and tzatziki were our favorites. For main course, I ordered the chicken limonata- a half roasted chicken, baby potatoes, artichoke hearts served in pan jus. My mother ordered a pasta dish with chicken and spinach in a tomato cream sauce, and my father the crazy lasagna. I was hoping my chicken limonata would have been closer to a Grecian-style lemon chicken , but I think serving it in pan jus was Ilios' spin on that traditional flavor. Potatoes and artichokes were tender, and complimented the chicken well. Mom's pasta was tasty, but I think dad's crazy lasagna wins. The best part of their dishes were the portion size- they ordered the half size, and still had plenty to take home for lunch the next day.

We debated deserts after seeing what the table next to ours had ordered- some sort of chocolate torte, but decided that would be saved for another time. The baklava and pistachio ice cream just beckons my taste buds. All of their deserts are made in house by their pastry chef (who is of Mediterranean descent). Authentic, to say the least, and I'm sure they are all delicious. 

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Authentic Mediterranean food, one of the best restaurants in south Charlotte."}
{"text":"We returned to Ilios Noche and I had to give an updated review.  I feel like service makes such a difference and we were warmly greeted and promptly seated for our 6:30 reservation.   Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and really made the experience ten times better than the last time we were here.  We shared the calamari as an appetizer and the tzatziki spread with pita.  Both were delicious.  The waitress also brought us out extra pita when she noticed that we were running low.  For our entrees I ordered a Caesar salad topped with salmon and my husband had the roast pork ribs.  We were both happy with our food choices and the service.  The atmosphere was also very warm and inviting.  We will be putting Ilios Noche back on our list for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent service over several visits and several different wait staff members.  Great appetizers, drinks and desserts.  This is becoming a \"go to\" spot for us.  Get reservations as it will be close to capacity."}
{"text":"Ilios noches is a hidden gem in quail corner. I love everything in there. Spinach pie, lamb, and scallops are my favorite.  I go there almost every weekend and their patio is awesome"}
{"text":"The food is great but the business behind the restaurant is shady. Prices on the menu are for the half priced portions, but you order and receive the full portion, at the full portion price. But no one tells you this. So glad we looked at the bill and remembered what the price of our dishes were. This is unfair and deceptive business practice. I guarantee the majority of people dining there have no idea. I'm happy to pay more for a larger portion but don't be shady and deceive your patrons."}
{"text":"I do love this place and their food, but I also have a wish-list for them.  It's NOISY - it's a great place for a lively conversation, but you have to really strain to hear.  A little attention to sound absorption would make it more pleasant - we found that the conversation from the table next to us was reverberating off the wall right into our space.  (There was live music, but it wasn't intrusive - it was nice.  The problem was the overall clatter and din.)  

Second thing is wait-staff that rolls in and verbally tramples whatever you were in the middle of saying.  The interruptions got really annoying after the first 20-30 times.  A simple 1-second delay would create the attention they need to do their jobs well."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Second time here as good as the first. This time meatball apps(amazing moist and tasty) and the killer cheese. Wow. Dinner was the crazy lasagna and that was awesome as well. Great service and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Delicious! We sat at the bar and Joel was amazing- very friendly bartender and did not steer us wrong. We got the hummus, Greek country salad, chicken parm (amazing!!) and chicken piccata (amazing!!!) we will definitely be back - thanks yelp for helping us find this spot"}
{"text":"First night in Charlotte for business and I found Ilios Noche. It's was a great dining experience - delicious food and a wonderful staff. They went out of their way to see that a single woman was well taken care of. Hummus with grilled pita to start,   goat cheeses stuffed peppadaw peppers, and out of this world grilled octopus!  The week isn't over - I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place awesome food awesome music, what a great place since they expanded. A must place for a night out on Friday or Saturday."}
{"text":"My wife and 9 of her girlfriends ate here tonight.  The food was good which is why I'm giving them 2 stars and not 1.  The last time I ate here with my family was on mother's day and we had a similar experience.  The service is slow....very slow.  They don't fill our drink glasses with any sense of regularity and the restaurant is hot...really hot.  So hot the women were fanning themselves while their bottoms were sticking to the seats.  The service is pathetic.  This was a reservation, not a surprise drop in.  Next time be prepared to have the proper staff in place.  Start cooling your restaurant earlier in the day.  Basics...
I would be surprised if this place continues to do business if they keep this up."}
{"text":"The food was a 4 star which is really high for me, but the service made it a 5. We went with a party of 5 and ordered several starter plates, ravioli, goat cheese in sauce and yogurt and all were great. I had the scallops and they were great. One of the guest at our table had to run his wife home and the food was delivered we asked them to keep the husbands food warm when he returned they had made him a whole new Gyro. Our waitress was great all the staff seemed very courteous. Very much enjoyed the visit."}
{"text":"Food was beautiful and delicious. Service was decent, but considering we were there very early on Saturday night, it could have been better. Nice date night spot but also kid-friendly if you come early."}
{"text":"As far as kid-friendly spots for foodies go (yes, I think that is a legit niche) Ilios Noche stands alone in the Ballantyne-ish area.  (It isn't really Ballantyne ... it's more of the Providence Rd gateway to Union Co.)

It can be packed, and the crowd is quite a mix ... people on dates, groups of older couples and young families.  It can be a zoo at the wrong time ... and sometimes service is slow as a result.  But we haven't had a catastrophic miss in that department yet (I will admit to being someone who can get his undies in a twist when the service truly breaks down.)

Most of the time it is great ... and just as importantly we have never had a bad plate there with family or friends.  We love this type of cuisine and they have nailed it again and again.  Robust but not overwhleming flavors, fresh ingredients, etc.

Fair warning: if you fancy yourself a purist looking for *only* traditional Greek or *only* traditional Italian then Ilios Noche may seem off.  This is a take on nouveau-Greek-Italian, and in our experience it comes off very well.

Ilios Noche is run by the same folks who own Nolen Kitchen in the Myers Park area ... you can sense a similar mindful approach in the decor and the ingedients they use in the food.

We've been going here for years now and remain unabashed fans."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent and portions are very generous. Server last night was a bit on the unfriendly side (I think she had too many tables) so can't give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ilios Noches is my favorite of the tri-fecta (Nolen, Ilios and Big View Diner) because everything I've tried here is fresh, well made and the happy hour (mezze menu)  ROCKS! 

For $5 you can choose from a HUGE list of appetizers and mini-versions of dishes.  Wine is $5 too. 

Spreads are $3.50 each during this time, and I truly recommend them all.  the Roasted Eggplant with toasted walnuts and red onion and mint is delish-- the Roasted Red Pepper which features aged feta and olive oil are two of my favorites. Get the cucumber yogurt tzatziki, but just know you'll get a side of it with other menu items, so you may end up with too much. (These spreads come with super soft pita...NOMMMM.)

Some of the standouts (AKA I'd order these again) include the trio of Mini Cheese Pies.  These are little bite-size flaky, crispy filo wrapped cheese delights that are salty and crunchy and utterly delicious. The burrata and saganaki too is fantastic...heck, all their cheeses are!

The shrimp, chicken and lamb souvlaki are good staples, served with that tzatziki and pita. The pork ribs are savory and tender.  All the salads are fresh and well composed too.  

As for the pizzas, I've never had them, and would like to try next time I go for dinner.  Some of the pastas are just...good, nothing special, like the spahgetini.  It almost makes me think the menu is too big and only the stars should remain. 

Desserts. This needs to get it's own section.  There's a berry dessert I MUST get no matter what. It's this portion of fresh berries, drizzled with this sweet balsamic glaze and served with BASIL ICE CREAM! I even asked for what kind of balsamic they use, and bought a bottle of it for myself! 

Ilios would get the full 5 stars if a few of their menu items were omitted, or executed a bit better. (The lamb pie, which is great on concept, my husband is Greek and his family makes AWESOME lamb pie...but this one has thick dough surrounding it, and it was still a bit raw in places.)"}
{"text":"You can't get better than Ilios! I've never had a single bad thing here. The lamb burger is the down-right best thing on the menu. They've also got incredible tzatziki, hummus, pita, garlic bread, feta, etc etc. I can't get enough. We eat here at least once a month."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little shopping Hamlet in Quail Hollow, lies Ilios Noche.  Mediterranean flavor with a Phoenician cuisine.

The service was great.  The food was great.  The decor was great.  The location?

The food here is quite good...and I'd love to frequent this location if there was a patio or some other type of outdoor seating that didn't look in to a parking lot.  This is really my only criticism.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"We went for the 2nd or 3rd time on a Saturday night.  Even though it was crowded we were seated at our reservation time.  Juan, our waiter did a great job taking care of us without \"hovering\" as somew waiters do.  I had the lasauga and I'm sure it was the best I have ever eaten.  Can't wait to go back for seconds."}
{"text":"Great place for a lunch or dinner date.  Eclectic mediterranean menu and good service.  A little crowded during peak times, which makes it not so great for romantic dates.

Manager always makes us feel welcome and special, even during hectic times."}
{"text":"After reading all of the wonderful reviews, my friend and I decided to try this restaurant.  Our waiter was fantastic but our food and overall experience was not!  We ordered the SUMMER BEETS Salad with macadamia nuts, goat cheese and aged balsamic vinaigrette for $10.00. The beets look liked they were straight out of a can, sprinkled with some very finely grated,  very bland tasting goat cheese, small chips of macadamia and without the balsamic vinaigrette. We both ordered the CAPELLINI sea scallops, with pancetta, white wine, garlic, lemon, broccolini; offered in two sizes. We ordered the smaller portion for $16.00. When we received the Capellini, the pasta portion was adequate but the dish was served with only TWO SCALLOPS!!  They were average sized scallops.  The pasta and scallops were delicious but we were very disappointed that we only received 2 scallops on a plate of pasta for $16.00.  We shared our thoughts on the pasta and the beet salad and he said he would ask the manager to speak with us.  This is were our experience in this restaurant went south in a hurry.  The female manager was rude and condescending! When I began to share our concerns regarding both dishes, she told me that she had personally watched the chef put the balsamic vinaigrette on our salad.  When I showed her that in our dish there was only beet juice (which is red) in the plate and not a hint of the vinaigrette (which is brown) she became very defensive and said that I did not know what I was talking about.  She treated me and my friend like we were two people who did not understand eating in a fine restaurant.  Her resolve to our situation was that she would discuss our concerns with the chef, when he was not busy, and get back to us.  The restaurant was packed and after waiting for 20 to 30 minutes for a response, we paid our bill with a 20% tip for our excellent waiter and we left.   If she had offered us a free dessert, my friend and I might have given this restaurant another try but after our experience, we will not return.  Just be sure if you go to this restaurant, ask a lot of questions about what you are ordering!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant, the souvlaki is excellent . Good selection of wine by the glass."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean restaurant! The pork ribs are to die for! And I love the olives slaw more than any other slaw that I've had. George the bar tender is awsome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I returned to Ilios Noche, as we do nearly every year, to celebrate our anniversary last night. Having honeymooned in Greece, Ilios Noche for many years was the closest we found in Charlotte to the food we ate there.

We were sat promptly for our 6:45 reservation. We called ahead to inquire about corkage fees, and found that there is no corkage fee for the first bottle of wine you bring to Ilios Noche, and a $15 fee for every bottle thereafter. For us, and our one bottle of wine that we have saved since 2007 to drink, it was a great deal!

Erika was our server, and she was fantastic at her job. We didn't want for anything. The food was spectacular. I ordered the Greek style pork ribs, and my husband ordered a lamb dish with orzo. The pork ribs were perfectly cooked, and easily eaten with a fork. Very tender, smoky and lightly flavored. We also ordered a sampler of all the dips (htipiti, hummus, tzatziki and an eggplant dip) as an appetizer. They brought us multiple pita bread refills until we'd conquered the appetizer, for which we were very appreciative!  Everything about our meal was perfect. I've been looking forward to the leftover ribs for lunch all morning!

Ilios Noche is expanding in a couple of weeks which hopefully helps with the space concerns noted in other reviews. Erika told us they hope to stay open through Mother's Day, doing construction on \"the other side\" of the soon-to-come-down wall in order to minimize their downtime. The sign at the restaurant said they're expecting to host a grand re-opening in June.

I highly recommend Ilios Noche, and learning about the free corkage on the first bottle of wine last night really puts them up there on places I'd recommend in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Since our 5-year-old daughter is spending the week with the grandparents, the missus and I are taking advantage of a well-deserved week off from the rigors of parenting a willful, precious and unruly child. So we got ourselves dolled up - if you consider me wearing a 16-year-old yet still fabulous looking black t-shirt courtesy of Banana Republic, a pair of blue jeans and some snazzy-looking brown loafers - and dined here. It had been some time since we'd eaten at Ilios; the times before, we'd enjoyed our dining experience, even if the restaurant was a bit small and often overcrowded.

IN has since undergone a renovation. Thankfully, it's expanded dramatically, so no more having to crowd yourself in front of the bar to await your table. There are plenty more tables, along with a few more outside. We would have opted for outdoor dining, but lately the humidity around the CLT has been nothing short of murderous, and I really didn't feel like dining out feeling as if I'd been draped with a wet towel. The former IN had more of a rustic feel; the new IN now sports a more upscale look, not too bright and flashy. Tasteful. Discreet. Nice touces all around.

I especially like the look the waitstaff was rocking: a casually wrinkled blue oxford button-up, blue jeans, and Chuck Taylors. Ever one on staff. Pretty cool, if you ask me.

One worry I always have when it comes to renovations is whether or not management can resist tinkering with the menu. Good thing very little has changed from the last dine my wife and I dined here. For appetizers, we opted for the calamari - crispy yet never overdone, with some delcious marinara and aoili dipping options - and the tzaziki. Perfect.

My wife enjoyed her Greek Country Salad with a nice-sized chicken breast, and I thought my wood-fired Piemonte pizza - prosciutto, fennel sausage, pepperoni, and gorgonzola - was quite tasty. Really, there's no way you can make a bad menu choice here. There's the right balance of authentic, without making too many concessions, and you're not bombarded with TOO many choices. Good menu, really.

IN is the right kind of restaurant for a first date or a get-together with friends. Last night must have been Ballantyne/Providence CC Desperate Housewives Night; between the overdressed housewives vamping at the bar, sipping their Sluttinis or whatever fancy and colorful cocktails, and the trio of desperates raving endlessly about  how titilating \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is - seriously, has that book become required reading for bored suburban housewives everywhere? - yet bellyaching about all their husbands want to do is have sex with them, and sex is so EWWWWWWWW, well, you won't be bored eavesdropping on their conversations about their First World Problems. Woe is them and their Zumba-fit bodies.

(Actually, I think every night is Ballantyne/Providence CC Desperate Housewives Night, so make a reservation and enjoy the sights and sounds.)

This place is another winner for the Stratos Restaurant Group, who also own Big View Diner (one of our go-to places) and Nolen. So we'll definitely make it back to Ilios Noche from time to time. You should too."}
{"text":"A friend recomended this place to my wife and me.  We were not dissappointed.  Great hummus, intimate atmosphere in spite of the stripmall exterior, great menu selction both in price and menu items.

Only negative I can come up with was the wait (30 mins) but for a Saturday night at 8:30 I can live with it.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I think the food quality has been covered through most of the other reviews, but I'd like to pitch in as well.

APPS: Saganaki is fantastic. Between two people it's a good amount of food when paired with the pita bread.

ENTREES: Lamb Burger is fantastic. I've gotten it twice and it's been perfect both times. Recommend the greek potatoes as the side. Also the Lasagna is impressive and has great flavor. The portion is enough to definitely take some home.

SERVICE: Great service. 

This is really where they did a great job. We went on a Wednesday night for an anniversary dinner but I wasn't sure what time we'd go so I didn't make a reservation. Well the restaurant was packed and we had the option of taking a table outside. It was a little chilly but they turned on the heater for us, however it just didn't have the same feel / ambiance as it does inside. So we said we weren't sure if we were going to be able to stay (40 min wait) since we couldn't be inside. Manager was the one that came to check on us and he immediately found us a table and set us up for dinner. Don't know where the table came from but I'm not complaining because they really saw to make sure we had a good dining experience. We'll be back many times in the future."}
{"text":"Used to love ilios. Lately it just hasn't cut it. It's clear that owners clean shop periodically and get all new staff and the most recent batch isn't very good. Employees seem timid around managers, once witnessed a manager berate an employee in front of customers. Don't staff enough on busy nights, managers give personal friends priority over people who actually have reservations (happened to us on Mother's Day). Food has gone downhill and just isn't worth the high prices. Spend your money at more worthy places like 131 Main. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Back again last night for takeout and the food was superb as usual, complete takeout service, on time and great."}
{"text":"My wife and I went back to IDN last weekend and I was kinda bummed to find that the menu had changed (along with the dining room, which was bigger and glitzier) and the experience was overall rather poor.  

It felt to me like they had fallen in to the classic restaurant trap - get a little bit of success, overexpand, get out over your skis, cut back on the quality, go out of business.  They're only at step 4, but a drag.  We had the greek salad, very little feta - not good.  Entrees were forgettable.  Oh well."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Ilios Noche 3 times and it has never disappointed. The food and wine is always tasty and the service is spot on. This last trip I tried the meatballs in red sauce and they were melt-in-your-mouth good. The dips are delicious. The moussaka takes a while but is worth it if you have the time. The zuchinni and eggplant chips are good but a bit greasy after the 8th or 10th one. We got the berry dessert and found the balsamic sauce to be a bit too strong; the basil ice cream was strangely tasty. The Ave Malbec was smooth and delicious. Note that the tables and bar are closely packed in. As other reviewers noted it could use a redesign (and a sunken or separated bar). Also, it gets very loud. Even after 8pm there often are rowdy young kids in the restaurant. Just be prepared for that if you are taking a date, and you may want to avoid weekends unless you eat late. Still the strong menu and service will keep us coming back. Oh and they have drink specials worth mentioning: Tues for wine, Wed for martinis, and Thurs for beer."}
{"text":"Zuch app is Awesome!  Owner is friendly and always a good conversationalist!"}
{"text":"Two stars says it all. This place is my least favorite of this restaurants groups three restaurants in Charlotte...Nolen Kitchen, Big View Diner, and this one. 

We began our experience by waiting 1 hour in the bar area, literally throwing 'bows in an effort to maintain control over some semblance of personal space at the horribly conceived bar area. There was only one seat available, so being the gentleman that I am, I gave it to my wife and stood behind her. I'm pretty sure the two-top table 6.5 inches behind me were THRILLED at having a front row movie theater view of my butt while they attempted to enjoy dinner. Did I mention we had reservations, and still had this kind of wait? Unreal. 

We continued our up-close-and-personal adventure with the rest of the restaurants patrons when we were finally seated at a table for two...5 inches from tables situated to the left and right. Remember that scene in \"Valentines Day\" (that god awful Ashton Kutcher RoCo), the scene where people are sat so close together they accidentally grab other peoples water glasses? Picture that, and you have a good idea of what this restaurant has to offer. I kid you not, we did actually end up having a conversation with the couple seated to our left, since we figured that was better than jockeying for position in the restaurant through sheer volume. Impromptu family-style dining, my wife and I joked later. 

The food was OK, and the service was ok...especially considering how slammed this place was, and how the wait staff could hardly maneuver between the restaurants patrons, all packed like sardines. For my money, Greek Isles in Southend is a far better Greek and Mediterranean experience than this place. Their dishes may not be as creative as Ilios, but I feel like they provide a more intimate and authentic experience...definitely more bang for your buck. 

I have to say, I was pretty disappointed with this place, especially considering how much I like Nolen Kitchen and the Big View Diner. This place has very little concern for customers comfort and overall experience, but judging from the poor table layout and double and triple booking reservations, they seem to place alot of concern over squeezing every single penny they can out of their little strip mall location. 

VERDICT: Won't be returning.

EDITORIAL NOTE:  I hate it when people give a place 5 stars and then rave on and on about their hummus and pita bread.  Yes yes...this place makes great hummus...so does my 4 year old niece who I'm teaching to cook.  Come on people, its garbanzo beans and olive oil.  You can't mess it up."}
{"text":"We went for a surprise bday dinner and the staff could not be any more  accommodating.  Zen, the waiter gave us superb suggestions and guided us to a great experience.  Sad the Bday boy hot his ribs late but things happen and they were so apologetic and treated us to 3 delicious desserts.  Seabass had good flavor and hubby had a Hawaiian fish special.  A bit freaked by all the bones in my fish but it was still a good meal.
They do have the spinach pie from the old menu and we will be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Great modern twist on classic Greek.  Everything was yummy.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  We went here the other night and everything was great.  We went on a Friday and it was crazy busy.  We had made reservations thankfully and I recommend doing that if you decide to go on a Fri/Sat.  There was live music playing and it was so nice.  The inside is decorated really nice and I like the ambiance a lot.  

They have a great menu for cocktails I ordered the Tambourine Man one (I think that was the name) and it was really good.  We skipped the appetizer and planned ahead for ordering a dessert.  

The menu is huge - there are so many options, but they all make sense and they mostly sound pretty good!  I ordered the fig pizza and it was delicious.  My husband got the lasagna and that was really good too.  I also tasted a friend's lemon chicken dish and I loved that as well!  Good food for everyone!

For dessert, we split the bittersweet chocolate with sorbet.  It was such a nice flavor combo.  I'm not usually a chocolate person, but our waiter recommended this dessert to us, so we decided to give it a try."}
{"text":"I'm not an epicurean. I'm an old fart and a fussy eater. But I'm not so far gone that I don't recognize quality when I see it.

Ilios Noche has it. 

There hasn't been a decent place to eat in my Quail Corners neighborhood since I moved here 14 years ago. Mama Riccota's, a Chinese Place, Wolfman Pizza . . . all gone (Wolfman moved and downsized from a sports bar to a Little League Pizza place.)

They starved to death. Based on that history, I figured we could perambulate over to the new Ilios Noche on a Friday before sundown without reservations and have our choice of seating. That was not in the cards. The place was packed and the only seating was on stools at a lunch counter against the wall.

Hardly enough room for a sandwich. Not nearly enough for a full meal.

Up steps Alex Mourias, the general manager. Our genial host takes my wife by the arm and steers us to the bar, scooting several patrons down a bit to make room. 

The leftmost seats at the bar are by the wait station where drinks are ordered and received. If our bartender is not in charge, she should be. She worked that bar with non-stop energy and diligence the entire time we were there. It was a pleasure to watch her multitask; mixing, taking orders, instructing, and having a running conversation with us and everyone else. Not the least of her skills was mixing my wife a flawless Martini (which should have printed instructions in several languages -- It's seldom correct.) I'll see if I can find her name and append it here later. She is deserving of our praise.

The rest of the wait staff were all friendly and eager to help. At least a good half dozen people cheerfully helped us -- without us needing to flag someone down! (Granted we were sitting in the center of activity, but still!)

The Food. 

My wife reports that the shrimp and sauteed mushrooms were absolutely scrumptious. My own dinner was the spaghetti and meatballs. Three generous meatballs were flavorful and good. the spaghetti with a marinera sauce was perfectly seasoned.

I wish I could eat more, so I could give a report on more items, but I'm picky, remember? Subsequent visits will provide me more to write about. There are several lamb dishes on the menu I'm eager to try.

We've found a place just blocks from home! We're going to be regulars."}
{"text":"First time, party of 4 for dinner. Spinach pie and mozzerella / tomato appetizers, dinners of lemonata chicken, lamb, pork ribs, and lasagna, all extremely well executed. We will be back and often, among the best restaurants in town. Very attentive service, live music. We recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Loved it! Had the Taste of All Spreads for appetizer. My main dish was the Greek style pork ribs which came right off the bones and tasted delicious. Dessert was a richly sweet baklava with pistachio ice cream. Yum yummy!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night with friends. Food and waitstaff were awesome. I highly suggest the Tangerine Man drink. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem!

The food is delicious, the staff is accommodating & welcoming, the atmosphere is very relaxing & modern! A great place for a quick tasty lunch or a long, romantic dinner!"}
{"text":"Visited this location on a Sunday afternoon for a few beers and appetizers. Great outdoor patio area in the sun which felt amazing! (Some shade available). 

Their zucchini chips were absolutely amazing. I couldn't stop eating them! There were plenty in the portion size and quite filling! 

I can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu - looked tasting and good!"}
{"text":"Solid.
Mediterranean influence. Great wine list. Great staff. Nice space.
We sat at the bar and worked our way through the menu - the bartender did not steer us wrong. Lamb dishes seem to be their strong point."}
{"text":"Went here for a date night with my husband on a Friday night. Quite busy but we had reservations so we got sat at our table promptly. The interior and the ambiance is pretty! For two people, we ordered 5 small dishes which was a little too much i think but we ordered: 

greek style pork ribs
oven roasted greek meatballs
capellini 
grapes & fennel salad
ilios grilled octopus 

All of them were okay. 
Nothing to blow our minds.  The service was okay as well. 
We may give it another try but wasn't too impressed the first visit."}
{"text":"Good food and super close to our house. I wasn't blown away but we will be back! Had a wonderful 2 man band last night that was perfect and not too loud. Caprese panini was delicious, Tuesday wine special was perfect. A nice place to have a drink and a bite."}
{"text":"Didn't love this place...been here a loooong time ago and the food has declined.   My chicken was luke warm and my date Brussel sprouts were \"meh\".    The server was nice.. drinks were great and the chocolate cake was awesome."}
{"text":"One of our all time favorite restaurants in Charlotte!  Service and food is flawless!  We are never disappointed and love both locations.  We'll be back SOON!"}
{"text":"Went for a family dinner (larger party of 11 including two kids). I called days ahead and reserved a table which was in a nice quiet area towards the back and all the hostesses I talked to were so sweet. Service was phenomenal- wish I could remember waiters name! Lots of drink refills, plates cleared quickly, etc. Food was great. We got lots of shared appetizers for the table and everything was delicious and came out hot and fresh. Some stand outs were the antipasto plate, pork ribs, spinach pie, souvlaki skewers, mushroom rice balls...I could go on we basically got everything! The baklava sundae for dessert was amazing. The kids menu was cheap and had a variety of items- no crayons or anything for them to do, so bring your own :-). Only complaint I had was not being able to order a half glass of wine- I didn't want another whole glass after my first (apparently the waiter asked and the bartender said no? So I didn't order another but at most places they'd rather have the money for a half glass than refuse a customer - so I thought that was odd). Otherwise a fun and yummy dining experience- thank you we will be back!"}
{"text":"My first Mediterranean experience and I am so glad this was the place. The food was fantastic. Our waiter was the best, top 5 on the Best of the Best. He provided great recommendations  and constantly checked in to make sure all was well. Their signature lamb dish was tender and full of flavor. Risotto is the best in the area, not the best I've had, but great.  The atmosphere was nice. Very modern and clean. The space is a little limited so you may want to make a reservation for prime time. Today is Friday, it was loud but there was live music in the bar area."}
{"text":"Best cocktails in south Charlotte. The atmosphere and ambiance are certainly a cut above the rest. The food is mouth watering and the service is on par with the upscale environment."}
{"text":"This was amazing. I recently moved to this side of town and I always go in that shopping center but I never noticed the restaurant. I finally went in and had the lamb with orzo pasta I forgot the name. It was so tender and the pasta and that sauce was amazing. Me and my date loved it. And the service was perfection everyone is so nice."}
{"text":"Ilios Noche continues to be a top choice in my Charlotte dining routine.  The menu choices are clever and service is generally very good. The bar area is one of my favorite spots to catch up with neighborhood friends.
The recent expansion and renovation of the restaurant is simply beautiful.

Some of  my favorite menu items that are consistently good include the flatbread pizzas, grilled octopus, Ilios salad and the greek style pork ribs.
My kids love the food here as well and insist on getting their own grilled octopus appetizers each. 

Very friendly and welcoming staff. My go-to neighborhood Mediterranean restaurant!"}
{"text":"My family really enjoys this place.  The service is always good.  The food always taste very fresh and they always prepare something nice for my daughter who has alergies.  We like the fried veggies, pizzas, ravioli, hummus, and the seafood.  Wine selection is not that bad either.  We never make reservations because we get their early with the kids (yes, the kids are always welcomed), but if you are eating between 7-9, I suggest you do so as the place is small."}
{"text":"I love this place. 

The name of this restaurant, unfortunately tucked away into a strip mall, means day and night. The decor matches the name - all blues and oranges. Whoever designed this place deserves an award. From the banquettes to the gorgeous lighting fixture above the bar to the open plan kitchen - it all added up to feeling like we weren't anywhere near a strip mall.

I treated friends to dinner here after doing some research online. One wanted a unique salad, the other wanted greek food, and this place advertises itself as greek, mediterranean and italian. We went on a Sunday or Monday night (can't recall which). We started out with their homemade pita and hummus which was really good. My friend claimed the fresh baked bread smelled a bit better than it tasted, but I thought it was perfect.

Our server was awesome. He was very knowledgeable about all of the dishes - we had questions about the cheese served in my friend's salad. It was mild and looked a lot like mozzarella but was actually a greek cheese whose name I can't remember. It was very, very good.

My chicken dish was served in a slightly lemon flavored sauce, with fingerling potatoes. It was actually pretty amazing. The presentation was really impressive with every dish we ordered.

Also ordered were the seafood pasta (spicy!! and delicious) and the crazy lasagna (two words: veal bolognese). Both were excellent. The only complaint was not enough traditional Greek dishes. Still, we would all go back in a heartbeat - just wouldn't go hoping for a wide selection of lamb dishes.

Though we didn't order any, their drink selection was intriguing. There were some good wines, along with yummy sounding coffee concoctions and a mixed drink called Cointreauversial: a name which we dubbed the \"most clever\" seen in a long time.

They offer some good wine and martini specials on different weeknights. I will definitely be back for those nights when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great apps and great service.  Always crowded so plan ahead.  Chicken sandwich and greek fries are my favorites here."}
{"text":"The cheese pizza was excellent! 

The pasta was so, so. I actually traded it with my friend because I disliked it so much! My Review is largely positive because of the cheese pizza. 

The bread is something that they don't just bring to you, it's something you must request. As this was my first time here, I happened to notice it on someone else's table. Honestly, It's not worth ordering. From the look of my friends face after tasting it, I didn't even try it. She said it was dry and crumbly. The balsamic vinegar and oil was also not very good."}
{"text":"The ribs appetizer is delicious !!!! Also for dinner the salmon is prob the best dish I have had there and I have tried most of them, which are all amazing, but salmon entree is THE best !"}
{"text":"Fabulous lamb burgers! We ordered take-out and the lamb burgers were sublimely delicious. Rich, buttery lamb meat with feta, roasted red peppers and savory flavors on a yummy roll with a side of \"greek fries\" that are basically sliced new potatoes roasted with oregano. Yummy!! I think it is one of the best lamb burgers in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Good spot to get great food. Beautiful dining area and exceptional staff.   My lasagna bowl was delivered perfectly prepared with tons of cheese and meat sauce.  Delicious!  Chicken pita with Greek fries equally yummy, with lots of seasoned chicken.  They have a brunch menu and all items going out looked great.  Nice find in a Plaza, a must try again for dinner, the bar area has tv for games.... I loved it."}
{"text":"We seem to be visiting this location more frequently so here are a few thoughts: The staff is extremely attentive and also appear genuinely happy. Comfortable setting for a date night spot or more casual for drinks and apps at the bar.  The menu is creative and the ingredients always seem precisely blended with perfect portions. Certainly on our regular rotation."}
{"text":"We went to Ilios Noche over the weekend and had a great time.
The restaurant was busy with lots of laughter in the air.
My daughter and her boyfriend were going their on a satty hawkins date (she's 15).

My wife and I also went separate to grab a bite at the bar and pay for their meal.
We had made reservations for them and they were seated promptly.
They had a Great time and were treated like gold..Thanks you so much Ilios Noche.
Sometimes teen at nice restaurant dont really get the deserved service.

There was a full bar so my wife and I ordered some wine to enjoy in the seating area.
We put our name in and were told the wait could be up to 2 hrs...it is what it is at nice restaurants on a Sat. night.
I asked for the manager \"Patrick\" to let him know we would be taking care of my daughters bill.
He laughed and thought the whole thing was cute.
To our delight he was able to get us seated fairly quickly and NOT next to my daughters table.
The whole experience was perfect...my daughter and her boyfriend had a Great time...we had a Great meal with first class sevice...AND once again I appreciate that Ilios and the team helped to accommodate our family...What a Rock Star of a manager!!
We will certainly be back and would reccomend this restaurant to anyone.

The atmosphere is wonderful and the food terriffic.
I will say that the thing that put us over the Top was the way the staff made us feel like REAL Guests!

Thanks again."}
{"text":"My wife and I sat at the bar to order drinks and dinner. The bartender (the one that looks like he's  12) was rude and unresponsive. 

We did get a first round of drinks and an appetizer but after that he disappeared. We asked him twice to order dinner and a second round. He just grunted and said wait. By the way, it was 8:00 pm on a rainy Monday night and they were not busy.

Spoke with the manager and the other bartender and expressed our displeasure. Both were very apologetic. Went to Hawthorne's @ Baird's Farm (Rea Rd.) and had a great dinner.

Too many restaurants with good service to put up with that."}
{"text":"I brought my daughter here for a birthday lunch while she was home from college. She loves greek food and I wanted to take her somewhere a little nicer than usual. I had been here before with my husband for our anniversary. The only reason I'm even giving this review two stars is because my daughter was impressed with the ambiance of the place. We had our whole day planned out starting with lunch but it took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and take our drink order. Shortly after, we placed our food order. We ordered an olive appetizer and we both ordered the lamb souvlaki with greek fries and ilios salad. I wanted to ask the server for something to accompany the olives as we only had toothpicks and olives but we didn't see her again for another 10 minutes. We just decided to save them for our meal. We were both in need of refills shortly after getting our meals and I needed salt for my lamb but we could not get our server's attention. She passed by our table several times without stopping so I finally gave up and used the sauce from my salad because I didn't want to to waste it. The server came and asked about refills at the point when I was ready to ask for the check. I paid the check and didn't get a thank you, have a nice day, happy birthday, nothing. Maybe she was having a bad day. I don't know the reason but what was supposed to be a nice quick lunch turned into a 2 hour ordeal. I was so frustrated that this was not the experience I wanted to give my daughter for her birthday. Originally we were going to go for her birthday dinner but I'm glad I took her alone for lunch instead of taking several guests with us."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the cucumber and tomato salad with salmon, the lobster ravioli, angry shrimp and mostly everything on the menu. The food is amazing, service is wonderful and last time I was there I saw Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing. Do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"Service makes a difference. I had my first experience at this restaurant and it was terrific. Very attentive server who made us feel welcome. Good pace of service and recommendations spot on. The food is of good size potions and our party made diverse choices all of which were good. Tried the Eagle red and it was amazing. Licked out as it was half bottle night too!"}
{"text":"Being foodies the family and I decide to check this place out as its sorta local and we wanted something different to eat.
Needless to say we were NOT IMPRESSED. Usually it's at least 1 of the 3 that enjoy their dish but this was a first for ALL 3 of us to not enjoy our dish by no means. I'm talking downright Yuck, the flavor - the service - the options just all around. 
The food was so horrible and unmemorable that I can't even tell you what we had. It wasn't picture worthy or anything. I am all about giving a place a fair chance so with that being said I will read through reviews and see what people are raving about and try one of those dishes and update my review if it is better than the experience we had as a family. 

Every place deserves another chance and this place will be no different.

The 2 stars is for location THAT'S IT THAT'S ALL"}
{"text":"Great restaurant all the way through. Food, drinks and the service was impeccable. We had Juan who served us and he was awesome. We had the hummus appetizers, scallops and they were awesome. For the main dish I had the lamb and my wife had the salmon and they were very tasty. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I discovered Ilios Noche on www.opentable.com, as I was looking for someplace new we could go on a Saturday night.  I've never been south of I-485 on Providence Road, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect or where it would be located.  I reserved a table for two to give it a try.  

We found the restaurant in the first shopping plaza we came to, behind all the road construction.  We were amazed at how crowded the restaurant was (and relieved that we had made a reservation in advance -- thank you, Open Table!).  We were seated within a couple of minutes.

My first observation of the restaurant is that it could easily be expanded for the amount of people that were there.  Right now, it's kind of small, and it would be nice to have some separation between the dining area and the bar area.  The bar could easily be expanded, too, as it makes the perfect waiting area (there really isn't one).  There is outdoor seating, too, which is great, but it's along the parking lot with no separation either, so it doesn't lend itself to be a fun area for dining.  There's also an area for take-out in the restaurant that surprising continously had a long line.  Wow!  They do a great take-out business apparently.  Unfortunately, the take-out line had to compete with the dining area, bar area, and open kitchen area, too.  

Now...onto the food.  We sampled a few appetizers/tapas to start, but you could easily make a meal out of sharing a bunch of these.  There are SO many from which to choose.  They have five different Greek spreads to order with pita pieces.  We sampled the Roasted Red Pepper \"Htipiti.\"  It was amazing.  Roasted red pepper with feta cheese?  YUM.  It was so creamy, too.  We also sampled the olive dish and the spicy calamari appetizer.  The calamari wasn't coated or fried; it was sauteed and smothered in a spicy almost-marinara sauce which, incidentally was too spicy for my partner, but -- loving spicy foods -- I found it to be \"just right.\"  

Since I normally only eat lamb in a gyro at the Greek Festival here in Charlotte, I ordered the Lamb Souvlaki pita wrap for my entree.  The sandwich offered chunks of lamb (instead of slices) and had a lot of flavor to it.  I even ordered some extra tzatziki sauce (the only way I like to eat cucumbers) to dip my \"Greek fries\" into.  

For being so incredibly busy, our server did a fantastic job, even though she apologized over and over for delays and waits that were nonexistent or weren't that bad.  It didn't help, though, that we witnessed the restaurant owner (acting as food expediter) barking at every server.  That was kind of off-putting and unnecessary, considering the servers all seemed to be working very hard and keeping up with how crazy-busy it was.  Plus -- hello! -- they're human beings.  Treat them like some.  Being a former server, I can only imagine what they say about him behind his back.  

I used the restroom before we left and felt like I had stepped into a different restaurant.  The hallway leading to the restrooms wasn't maintained very well and neither was the men's restroom itself.  I was surprised considering how well the rest of the restaurant appeared.  I felt like I was walking into an \"employees only\" area that they weren't as concerned with.  

Having ordered so much food, I took some baklava to go.  I got a huge piece for $7.  I sampled some of it and it was delicious.  It definitely competes with the baklava I usually love to get at the Greek Fest.  It's very moist (which I love) and full of sweet flavors.  Kudos on a great baklava! 

All in all, I think Ilios Noche was an excellent find and we're very glad we went.  Would we return?  You bet.  I'd love to try many other things from their extensive menu.  And I'll definitely make a reservation to ensure a very short wait time again!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday for lunch. Very nice fixtures and furniture; nicely appointed. Cloth napkins and accompanying ambience, but not 'stuffy' at all. There is an outdoor seating area, too, that is covered from sun and weather. Waitstaff was friendly and professional. Not too intrusive, not too scarce; just right. I had the chicken panini with chickpeas on the side. Very good. Also had the \"Greek fries\" which are basically seasoned fries in an oval shape; they were good. Typical entree is $8-$12. Lunch for two, no dessert, was $30 with tip."}
{"text":"Best cultural food I have found in Charlotte.  Whether you want a casual lunch or formal dinner or something in between. This spot is sure to please. Great wood oven pizza. Incredible pastas. Salads worthy of praise. So far the Greek Ribs and crazy lasagna are my favorites, I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Good Greek food overall.  Good staff. Nice drink menu and fairly priced. The appetizers are a bit of a let down, wish they had good flaming cheese. The lamb pie entree is amazing good!"}
{"text":"This was only my second time at IN. I ordered a Belgium waffle. I'm still hungry. It didn't come with anything but fruit on top. It would have been good to have some potatoes on the side."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. A Diamond in the Ruff here on Providence Rd. I have never been disappointed with the food. The staff and service is always on point."}
{"text":"After several months of contemplating a visit to the newest location, I decided to surprise my husband with a date night at Ilios Noche! I set up reservations for 8:15p and when we arrived a few minutes early we were greeted with a beaming smile and sat immediately. Such an unexpected delight! We were then introduced to our server, Malia, who truly offered the most attentive, genuine and accommodating service to compliment a most exquisite cuisine. From the roasted red pepper spread and mushroom arancini to the kale/beet/goat cheese salad, our taste buds were alive and dancing in our mouths! Even their house made ginger beer was a hit. My husband, being a vegetarian, asked Malia to have the chef conjure up a creation of his own design. She happily took the request to the kitchen and they did not disappoint. As I savored the lobster ravioli, my husband devoured his custom made pappardelle concoction. We passed on dessert as our waist lines couldn't bear another inch, but we will certainly carry the memories of this evening with us and look forward to dining again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Friday night. 
Surprised to see that they have live music and it was fairly good.
Food: slightly pricey for this type of food but not too bad. For example a souvlaki sandwich and fries were about $12, but entrees are a few bucks more. Food came out fairly fast and was warm and delicious. I ordered the chicken souvlaki with greek fries.
Staff and management were very polite and friendly. I had asked for no onions on the sandwich, but when it came out it had onions. I pointed that out to the waiter. He was very apologetic and a minute later the manager came over offering us to make a new one, but we refused.
I think they are owned by the same company who owns the Big View Diner. 
Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I would say that it's ok. It's not my favorite but it's good. My first time we were here I don't recall what I had I just remember walking away and feeling like it wasn't that great, we had really odd service and waited a while for our food. My sister and I came in here last week after a very long day and we sat outside and had a really good dinner service was good Margarita's were good and the food was good. We had the fried Calamari to start I didn't care for the two sauce they served with it but the Calamari itself was good. We split a Pizza that had Prosciutto and Artichokes with Peppers it was good and we also had the Ilios salad with a side of Risotto. It was better than my first time here and I left satisfied!"}
{"text":"Ordered last night and the order was delivered . We ordered a sandwich,pizza and pasta as we always do and it was sooo salty we had to throw everything out. we have eaten at the providence road location for years and ordered the same items and it's always been delicious.  Very disappointed after spending $60."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I took golf lessons at Providence Country Club, which was really an expensive excuse to go to Ilios Noche each time for lunch afterwards.  Every time I'd have the salmon sandwich, perfectly grilled medium rare and juicy and perfectly seasoned with salt and cracked black pepper with red pepper glaze, arugula, tomato and cucumber... it melts in your mouth and is on perfectly toasted bread. It's making my mouth water as I write. If you want to go extra decadent, add on a huge piece of gooey honey laden baklava and it will send you to the moon!  

So why not 5 stars? Well the dinner- it gets ultra crowded, and the tables are quite close together and you never like to eat while the vultures (people waiting for tables) hover glaring at you to scoff quickly.  Also some of the entrees are good, but not \"send you to the moon\" salmon sandwichy fantastico.  I do remember the scallops being very good. That said, even though Nolen Kitchen is way closer to me, I think Ilios Noche has much better food.  Too bad it's like  8 hours away. Slight hyperbole.  We'd be regulars if it was closer and larger though. Yum.

The environment with the open kitchen is cute neighborhoody trattoria. Well done, Stratos!

PS I have had them cater a few things and they did a great job!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it will not be my last time.  They had an appetizer of spicy wings suggested by the server glad I took his advice.  The crazy lasagna small portion was to die for.  Hefty serving for the small dish, still took a lot home. Our server Ernesto was great.  Nice atmosphere and there was a line to get in when we were leaving."}
{"text":"Mostly excellent but sometimes misses the mark. Fried zucchini chips are legendary and should be ordered and shared. Or eaten by yourself with a cocktail and a short shame spiral."}
{"text":"I found my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.

The food here is very well thought out to the last detail. Service is amazing. Atmosphere is woodsy mountain lodge. Prices are half what you'd expect for the quality.
Once inside, you forget it isn't a standalone establishment so don't let the outside fool you (it's in a strip mall). 
Wow"}
{"text":"Always good. And they reopened. Much better. Diver's Scallops and chick peas. Who would have thought. But they were great. My girls Loved the cheese pizza. Truth be told I thought it was quite good as well."}
{"text":"Drinks are on point!!  The bartender was not that knowledgeable about drinks but that was ok.  He was willing to take direction.  I ordered my usual of Amaretto Sour with a splash of Sprite and it was good.  There is a menu of drinks and this seemed to be all the bartender could make.  I was ok with that as trying new mixed drinks is a good thing to do anytime of the day!

I also had lunch.  Tried the meatballs, ribs and yogurt dip.  They were flavorful but could've used more heat as in they were warm.  The pita was great.  This restaurant was confusing as the menu is Greek and Italian.  They need to pick a side.  The seating is well appointed and the restaurant is beautifully decorated.  The manager was very professional and I was impressed with her style and how she delivered my food.  The wait staff was very professional as well and I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Only been here once on a romantic night out with my wife.

Restaurant is a little cramped making it tough to enjoy a private meal without occasionally looking over at the folks seated next table and smiling back. Waiting staff is excellent and explained the menu very well. Food was OK."}
{"text":"Brought friends here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant wasn't too busy and easily accommodated our party of 5. 
The men ordered lamb burgers which were huge and very good. There was a salmon entree with white beans which was delicious. The last dish was falafel and chickpea salad. Falafel balls were crispy on the outside and moist inside. I enjoyed them with the salad. However when I picked up the pita to finish the dish, a long black hair was under the wrapper. Ewwww. 
Not sure we will be back. Everyone has an off day."}
{"text":"We headed over for restaurant week. An incredible experience. Food, service, atmosphere and experience were perfect.    I had the ribs and they FELL off the bone.  Amazing !   Will be visiting again very soon."}
{"text":"2 stars for thinking they know how to do chicken and waffles for brunch. The chicken and waffle is merely a vessel for the three sauces it comes with, which for a fried chicken lover is very disappointing. Step 1 brine chicken, step 2 add seasoning to the flour...easy"}
{"text":"Updating my review, we did come back to give this place another chance. And I'm so happy we did. The service was great, the staff was really friendly, even though the restaurant was way busier than the last time we went. Food is delicious, ordered a margarita pizza as an app, the dough tasted great, even my husband who doesn't like crust, didn't leave any behind. For my entree I had the village Greek salad, it's my third time ordering and it's perfect every time. My husband ordered veal burger and a side of Greek fries, I tried some, SO tasty. I guess, we'd have to come back the third time to see if the service stays consistent, but the food is definitely really high quality and worth trying :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and prices were reasonable at Ilion Noche when ordering from appetizer and salad menu which is all we wanted. We ordered chicken nuggets and a pasta dish for my 2 yr old and 4 yr old grandchildren and they devoured all of it.  Our servers were attentive and friendly from the minute we walked in the door.  The meatball appetizer was utterly delicious and my favorite was their small serving of goat cheese in a tantalizing tomato sauce served with toasted/seasoned bread triangles (not pita). Yum!  My salad, greens with toasted pecans and feta was tossed with a delightfully light lemon vinaigrette.  I plan to dine here again when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is a nice Italian/greek sort of place. The decor is nicely done without being over done and the food and service are great. I had a grilled chicken sandwich and mom and sis had salads along with a sort if spinach thinger wraped in filo dough. Sis is mostly vegan and she was happy with it and eats there quite a bit. I'm a confirmed carnivore and I liked it too. So it'll probably do for everyone. It was a little on the expensive side but not outrageous and the food and service were worth it."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what it is. Not a bad experience, but not as special as they seem to think they are. I don't see any reason to go back, but it certainly wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Since the ilios noche on Providence Road is one of my favorite restaurants, I wanted to check this location as well.  They are located in the corner of the Quail Corners Shopping Center closest to Park Road.  So, the other day on the way back to the office from a client meeting, I decided to pop in to have a bite of lunch.  

The layout and d√©cor looks very much like the renovated original location, and the menu is pretty much the same as well.  Which is good, because I love the offerings there.  It was tough deciding between the pasta dishes, sandwiches, and salads. Ultimately, I decided to go with one of my favorites - the fig, grape, and fennel salad with grilled chicken added to it.   

The service was very good at this location on my visit.  If you have not yet tried ilios noche, you definitely should go check out their delicious offerings.  Some of my favorite starters include the hummus, sea scallops, and the cheese plate.  As for the dinner entrees, any of the wood-oven specialties are good.  Pizzas are good here as well."}
{"text":"I want to say that Ilios Noche has been open the whole time that I have lived in Charlotte, 9 years and counting. It took me 9 years to make it here and boy am I kicking myself. Head and shoulders, their tzatziki is the best that I've had since moving from Montreal. The perfect combo of garlic, dill and cucumber is on display here and that is just with the dip appetizer.

For my main, I chose the veal chop which came with saut√©ed mushrooms and included a side. I can't begin to tell you how much I like mushrooms, so as my side I got more mushrooms. 
Other people at the table were drooling over my entree, so I guess that I made a good choice. I didn't try any other entrees, but the salmon, tuna and pasta entrees represented at the table look tasty as well.
 
I will certainly be returning to Ilios Noche with the wife soon."}
{"text":"This review is mostly about the service as we have not had any food. It took 25 minutes to get drinks. 15 min of sitting without one word from anyone welcoming us or letting us know a waitress was coming. 

Also when we called to reserve they said it was no problem to sit outside then when we showed  the hostess said well \"that's not my fault I did not tell you that. did you get the name of the person you talked to\". A simple I am sorry for the confusion but we don't reserve outside would have been much more appropriate.

So the review started at 2 stars. I moved it to 3 stars because the food was good and the manager came over to check in us and quickly fixed a salad our Vegan daughter ordered which came with cheese on top. He got her a new salad very quickly.

I would come back here again and I think they just need some changes in service on a. Busy night."}
{"text":"Pita was not store bought. I wish they made in-house pita. Cocktails , food and desserts were all tasty"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my Husbands birthday. We had the Zucchini chips, the grilled flank steak, side of Risotto Parmigiano, and the apple cobbler for dessert.  Joel was our waiter and by far one of the best wait staff of all time.   ALL of the food was amazing, flavorful, and fresh.  Specialty cocktails were incredible and wine selection was on point!   This place is a must for a great experience.  The manager (owner?) even came by after our meal and checked on us and wished my husband a Happy Birthday!!!  We will be back and you should go also!!!   Thank you Joel!"}
{"text":"Great food. Not impressed with Management staff.

We walked in around 6p on a Sat. night. Even the hottest uptown restaurants keep a few tables for walk ins. The manager had a bit of an attitude because we were a walk in over the weekend. Get over yourself. This isnt NYC. This is freaking Ballentyne!!

The place was packed and we sat at the bar. All the food was pretty good - more tapas style. Meatballs were OK, not great. 

I did get introduced to a lovely Malbac called Llama from the super friendly bartender.

I do like the romantic dim lighting atmosphere here, but the manager turned me off enough to lead me to explore other Mediterranean/greek places to find my fav."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a couple years now and I think it just keeps getting better and better! Our most recent visit was several weeks ago and I am still thinking about the excellent food and service we received.

As usual, we started with the calamari which comes with olives mixed in, which happens to be a very tasty inclusion. Since cocktails were only $5 on Wednesdays, we all started with the Detox #2, which includes vodka, grapefruit, coriander, bitters, and is absolutely delicious!

For my main, I got the pan seared flounder, which was amazing! I also felt the portion was generous and I was able to take a decent amount back home to enjoy the next day! My dinner companions were equally pleased with the lobster ravioli and octopus. I never had octopus before and thought it was seared well and perfectly seasoned! 

As if the incredible food was not enough, we also had an amazing waiter, who was charming, attentive and made us feel right at home (I think his name was Dave)."}
{"text":"This place was already awesome to me with their delish lamb dishes and fresh salads. I just learned that they had a lunch special for $10 on Monday-Friday where you get one entree, a salad and a side dish.  It's not huge portions, but definitely enough to fill you, and super delicious.  A must go-to place for nice ambiance, great food and great service!"}
{"text":"We attended the \"Friends and Family\" Preview party on Sunday night for the grand opening of the expansion.  The new space is much needed and I love the layout.  The restaurant put on one heck of a party with plenty of yummy hors d'oeurves, drinks, sweets and live music.  I can't wait to go back and have dinner in the new space!"}
{"text":"Five Stars because when a food establishment becomes an extension of family - the good kind of family that's there in times of celebration and challenge - I say they deserve nothing less!  With Spanish and Italian blood running through my veins, food that is thoughtfully and simply prepared with fresh ingredients is the only measure. Ilios is not about \"dining\" out in grand or ostentatious way.  Ilios is everything about eating a meal, being nourished with warmth and heart.  Seeing the line cooks chop away at their fresh ingredients in full view of patrons communicates to me every time that I'm about to be fed well. By people who care about what they do.  Have noshed on octopus, cerignola olives, delicate calamari, burrata tomato basil, and paper thin zucchini chips to my hearts content.  Have gobbled up unbeatable pork ribs, meatballs and house made sausage scraping up every last bit of of sauce with panzino or pita.  Have shared with my teenagers and their friends bowls of every creamy pasta and pizza on the menu.  Have even sipped take out hot lemon chicken soup when sick.  And return always with my husband and dearest friend to sit and be still and served with an ilios salad, skewers of lamb, scallops and trusty taste of all spreads, our glasses of wine in hand.  And week after week, month after month, year after year, NEVER grow tired of the little place in a shopping strip that has been so good to us."}
{"text":"Amazing wine list for great value, stunning decor and awesome service combined with best mahi fish I have ever enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Amazing quality of food that is far superior to chain restaurants, Ilios prepares their food fresh from scratch daily, I had the most amazing wild caught salmon there last night.  Service is excellent and food quality is 5 star for 3 star prices, excellent value.  Best food, service and atmosphere in Charlotte, NC!  I dine at the finest Zagat rated restaurants in the USA and I would rate Ilios Noche superior to the best Zagat rated in NY, Las Vegas and other major cities.

{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here with my wife on a Friday evening. Rather packed and bustling inside. We chose to sit outside. 

Our server was nice and gave us the rundown of the menu. Drinks, pleasantries, the whole shebang. 

The atmosphere is pretty plain. Nothing daring or over the top. I recommend sitting outside if it is nice. 

Do yourself a favor and order the zucchini and eggplant chips. Lightly salted, nice crunch and served with a refreshing tzatziki. 

I ordered the spaghettini and meatballs. A generous helping of pasta and the meatballs were very robust and hearty. I wasn't disappointed at all. 

My wife ordered the Greek salad. Pretty standard and nothing to complain about. Nice and fresh ingredients. A nice touch with the cucumber, I might add. Good balance with the striking flavors of the kalamatas. 

We ended up ordering dessert. A rarity for us. We ordered the ricotta cheesecake. It had a very perky and tangy raspberry glaze and a hint of lemon zest. Not a bad combo. The texture was a little wrong, but mainly because I'm not the biggest fan of ricotta. Definitely worth the culinary venture, though. 

I'd say Ilios can hold its weight in the Italian game. Very robust flavors, tons of items to choose from, generous portions....what else could you possibly ask for? 

A great date night spot as well. If you find yourself in South Charlotte and looking for a sit-down Italian dinner, Ilios Noche should be #1 on your list."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious!! 
This is my second time here and I was just as impressed as the first time. Great customer service, yummy food, and great portions. I think we found our new favorite date night spot!

I've had the calamari, the spicy seafood Arrabiata, and the Sea scallops with mushroom risotto. All so good! Next I'll try the lamb burger."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location since the Park Road one is much closer; but how different can it be?  A bit.
We love the Park Road location.  All the servers are friendly and menu savvy, bartenders knowledgeable and unpretentious and the food is very consistent.  
We ordered a couple of small plates, saganaki and the meatballs which were well prepared.  The calamari was over cooked and chewy.  It looks as if they started using a frozen pre-breaded item. Shame.
Six of us eating at the bar; one bartender was training another so the service was not so attentive but still very friendly."}
{"text":"This was a great find in the South Charlotte area.  I'm always a bit skeptical of restaurants in strip centers, but I was immediately impressed when I entered the front door.  The ambiance is upscale and elegant, yet perfectly comfortable.  We started with the dip sampler and the smoked eggplant dip blew my mind.  Seriously - I could have made an entire meal out of that and pita.  If I went back I'd pass on the hummus and tzatziki, as neither were anything special in comparison.  For dinner, I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried the Moussaka.  It was an enormous portion!  It was a great mix of savory flavors - eggplants, lamb, potato, and a rich cream.  The other person in my party ordered the Carolina flounder, and was disappointed that it was heavily fried fish.   The accompaniments were listed as artichokes, potatoes, and a compote, yet there was a single quarter sized piece of artichoke, far too many potatoes, and a dime-sized portion of raisin compote.  Despite one disappointing entree, I'd likely return in the future if I was in the area, though probably wouldn't make a special trip for a meal given the phenomenal Charlotte culinary scene."}
{"text":"Excellent! Food is superb, different, eclectic. I had the Crazy Lasagne...the only thing crazy about it was  how crazy delicious it was! I love the atmosphere at the Quail Corners location...very pretty outdoor patio seating. To top it off...excellent, friendly service. So happy that this great place is just a quick walk for me!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation on Open Table to eat here on EASTER Sunday . My daughter is vegan , and the menu seemed a good fit for her . Our meal was fine, and our bill came to 81.00 and some change . My husband left a hundred and a twenty in cash , and we left the restaurant around 5. At 6:30, I received a message  from the manager ( he had my number because when you make a reservation on Open Table , your info is on your profile ) . He said he was calling about our \"
Open check \" we needed to take care of !! I have never been so insulted in my life !!! I don't know what kind of scam someone was trying to pull .. but SOMEONE tried to make the manager believe we had left without paying .. my husband called him and talked to him and he apologized . I have no idea what happened , but we will never go back there !"}
{"text":"Met a colleague for dinner their last night because it was perfectly located between Ballantyne and Southpark.  We bellied up to the bar, and they had my favorite Pinot Noir (MacMurry.)  We decided to graze on appetizers/starters and we had the taste of all 4 dips and were persuaded to try the octopus......BEST I have ever had, WITH picked onions.  It is a must visit and great atmosphere for hanging out in the bar with colleagures and/or friends."}
{"text":"As usual the food and ambiance was good, service not so good! We had a party of 6 with reservations, we cozier up to the bar to wait for our table, after waiting 30 minutes and watching everyone get seated and then the restaurant start to empty I went to the hostess and asked what the status of the our party was? She said oh we seated that group already, I said thats interesting since the reservation is in my name. Now to dinner, they served my wife's dish to another table and so she got to watch the rest of us eat while they cooked another lamb burger. Ok all of this is understandable if the operator acknowledges errors and does the right thing to fix the errors, comp drink, comp dessert, comp my wife's dinner or just have the manager come over and apologize. With that said food was really good and that will ultimately keep us coming back."}
{"text":"I forgot to write an update. The manager called us and gave us coupons to come back. She was very curteous and apologetic.  We can back and the service was better this time. Love the Lamb Burger."}
{"text":"Chicken Caprese Panini was delicious. Fancy potatoes on the side with Parmesan and seasoning!

Our server was a very nice man from Colombia, he was very attentive. Loved the outdoor seating in the sun."}
{"text":"Shouldn't have had high expectations. Went for Valentine's Day and got the $28 lamb dish. Most overpriced plate I've ever eaten. Basically looked like they have a huge vat of this medium quality lamb in the kitchen and the chef takes a scoop of it and plops it on top of some orzo. Good, but not $28 good. Second and final complaint; our waiter. We sat in a back corner of the restaurant, which was actually kinda romantic, but the waiter was serving both us and the table next to us at the same time. I'll give the wait staff a slight break because it was V Day and crowded, but when I'm paying $100 for a meal, I don't need my waiter calling me \"boss\" and telling my girlfriend how he and his girlfriend were \"eat light this year so they can stay up and get freaky.\" Because last year they got \"too stoned\" and ate too much, causing them to fall asleep and not \"get it on.\" Dude, I get that you're in a good mood because the night is almost over, but try to act somewhat professional. For those of you who have read this, I'm not a snob. I'm a normal guy who wanted to take his lady to a nice meal. Unfortunately, I chose Ilios Noche and got Spicoli's cousin for a waiter."}
{"text":"I anyone wants to have a very fancy dinner with an excellent atmosphere, eat here. My wife and I have been coming here for every important occasion in our life. We have been here for every one of our wedding anniversaries, along with surprise birthday parties, graduation parties, and more. On the menu I recommend calamari, the roasted red pepper humus. For the entrees there are so many to choose from, but my favor it is the steak and I have it topped with blue cheese, accompanied by the Greek Fries. For the staff all of them are excellent, but Shane is a great waiter. Overall experience 10 on a scale of 10."}
{"text":"Good food, lively atmosphere, & kind service. Casual or special night...you'll enjoy yourself and have a new place on your list of \"regulars\"."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and ambiance.  Just wish there were more than four medium size scallops in the full size capellini and more than three tiny olives in the half size Greek salad."}
{"text":"Food was great so I will start with that as a positive.  Also positive was the manager who was nice and whatever waiter quickly brought us a new salad when our non cheese eater realized there was cheese on the salad.  

Negative-Service could use some work.  Maybe they were overwhelmed on a Saturday night but we sat for 20 minutes without one person coming to the table to tell us sorry we are so busy but a waitress will get to you at some point.  Took about 30 min total from the time we sat (we had reservations) to the time we got drinks and someone took our order. Hostesses could also use some customer service training.  Probably will try it again but at the bar and not with a group."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Mediterranean food and i heard they had OMB Dunkel on draft so I headed over for dinner.  
I got some fried cheese appetizer.  I was offered pita bread with it, but ate it alone.  It was great.  They pan fry it so it's nice and crispy but not too greasy.

Then I had the lamb burger with the chick pea salad.   I debated what temperature to get the burger.  I'm a medium rare steak but medium well burger kind of person so i went with medium for this.  The lamb was juicy and not gamey like lamb can sometimes be.  The chick pea salad was a great complement and wasn't too salty or oily like those salads can be with prepared dressings.  

Service was great, but i was there off peak."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all! First of all my father asked to have a Tanqueray and Tonic to drink and the waitress had to ask multiple times what that was then she responded by saying \"I'm not 21.\"Normally the waiter will bring out some bread to the table while you wait, NOPE not at this place....how thoughtful(do you sense my sarcasm?) We were a party of four and everyone in my party had their food brought to the table except me, and I ordered a salad.  After waiting for about 10 minutes my salad was finally brought to our table.  Don't you think salad would be the first thing that would have been made? After we received our food we had to wait for silverware to be brought to the table because at this restaurant they don't put the silverware on the table....some young boy bring you the silverware from the back with his bare hands. YUCK! I had ordered The Greek Country salad, well little did I know that meant it had NO lettuce/spinach at all....it was just cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions.  In the description on the menu it says \"hand picked vine ripe tomato.\"  I didn't know that it would be multiple tomatoes, it only said one! The whole salad was nothing but tomatoes! I must say for a place that has a somewhat nice atmosphere this place had nothing but teenagers as servers....this is not a local pizza parlor, they need to employ more experienced servers because these kids were walking around as if they were confused about everything.  Sad to say I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Brunch was full of flavor.  Now, I know why there were not any salt & pepper shakers at the table. The Greek sausage Benedict was perfect, in fact, I'm now occupied with how to get one of those  English muffins on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Another winner to choose from in the group of Xenia restaurants. Though partial to BigView this classy eatery offers a step up in dining. You know it the moment you enter the restaurant and all through the experience you'll know you're not just at an average restaurant but rather a very nice dining  experience. The menu is unique and the food is delicious. While offering delectable Greek menu, there is a variety of items to choose from. 
Tired of the average - looking for a palatable change - this is the place !
Don't miss this one !"}
{"text":"THEY REMOVED THE MEZE MENU!!!!

The Cheap tapas menu was the best kept secret in town prior to the renovation. Yes, it is now an amazingly beautiful restaurant, but you can't argue with value. 

Great calamari. Greek style ribs nice. Almost everything here is good.  The patio is so much nicer. You can't believe you are in strip mall.....until you walk outside and run into a HT"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and I wasn't impressed by their brunch menu. It lacks depth and creative choices for brunch options. There were three fritattas and some omelet options and of course waffles and pancakes. I was just searching for something more creative.  It was a little heavier on the lunch side than brunch. 

I got the chicken and waffle sandwich. I had issues with it and had to send it back. I'm not one for sending food back unless it's just wrong. The chicken wasn't well seasoned and desperately needed some salt.  The waffles were rock hard, you could Crack a tooth on them. I was with a large party and 3 of us hard waffles and we sent them all back. Both times my sandwich didn't have the honey&hot sauce and ligonberry jam on it as described on the menu. When I asked about the jam, no one seemed to know or realized that the jam was supposed to be on the sandwich. And I never did get the honey & hot sauce combo. 

The Greek fries were great. I actually paired them with their homemade tzatziki sauce, which I was charged $1 extra for a small ramekin of. 

If I come back here, I will try dinner and not brunch. Maybe their dinner dishes are winners. Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"My first visit here with the family for Father's Day and while others in my family enjoyed their meals, I on the other hand had a different experience.  I am not here to knock Ilios Noche, I just didn't have a great experience with my meal.  I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and requested the dish done with a slight sear on the outside.  When the food finally came, the portion was the size of my iPhone, not the best sight I've ever seen but hey it is what it is.

When I tasted the salmon it was definitely crunchy and overcooked.  Also, the taste profile of the dish was not to my liking and needless I wasn't pleased. I've read other reviews and there seems to be a consensus on the quality, decor and waitstaff.  So I'll check this off as my bad, however I don't see myself returning for a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Recently moved back to Charlotte after 6 years away, and our return to Ilios Noche was such a welcome surprise.  We didn't expect it to be even better than we remembered.  Friday night, 6:15 and the place was packed.  Great energy, and our waitress Marie hooked us up.  I wanted to order the spaghetti but she wisely led me in another direction and I was so grateful.  Everything was expertly prepared, the wine complemented the meal, and the  advice from Marie made the evening."}
{"text":"Great value for healthy delicious lunch. $10 for their special featuring salad choice, protein ( salmon, Chicken, Shrimp) and a side. Five stars!"}
{"text":"This is one of my regular spots. The food is always excellent! I've had the lemonata, braised lamb, grilled octopus, pasta with scallops, spicy lamb pizza and some other things. The only thing I didn't like was the falafel. EVERYTHING is delicious! My son knocked my drink over and they ran out of one ingredient and used something else. It was still good!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! Love this place!  Great upscale neighborhood hotspot that has great food, crowd and ambience!  Love half price bottles on Tuesday!  Everyone I know loves this place.  Food is the best quality!"}
{"text":"Singing: Tomorrow will come but girl I can't wait. It's our anniversary.... 

my dude and I celebrated our anniversary here. Nothing grand but just as special as the last. We don't get out alone often with a little one as I'm not cool with just anybody watching my baby. 

We get in when the lunch crowd is dwindling around 1ish. Cozy seating. Nice setting for lunch or dinner. Outside seating would have been nice in cool yet warm weather. 

Our waiter was at the door when we arrived but to our surprise there was a great guy who gave us great advice on the best dishes to choose from the menu. 

Kaycee has a catering business and works here part time. His wife is a baker. We got their cards and a good deal should we be in need of their services. 

Anyway, the food....

The zucchini chips and tzaziki sauce was really good. They give you so much. Even though you're sharing it's still a lot. So to our surprise because it was our first time there, it was free. 

My drink was aight. Hence the reason I can't really remember the name. 

My lamb burger and fries were great! Luckily the burger toppings made up for the poorly seasoned meat. I don't believe it had any salt or pepper in it. But it's all good. The lamb was juicy. A crisp buttered bun would have been better. 

My dudes food was pretty good. He had some sort of pasta with mushrooms. The flavor worked but I'm not into mushrooms. I don't woogly things in my mouth. Stop it. 

The dessert was a miss. The blondie and chocolate cake were both dry as shit. That joint crumbled right before my eyes. I chipped away at it a couple times for a taste. The ice cream is decent. Buuuuut I wouldn't recommend it. It had all the potential to be great, yeeeeeaaaa I stopped at the Teeter and got me some Strawberry ice cream. 

Service was excellent. Thanks Kaycee! The food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a friend on a Friday night before going to a movie.. I have looked at their menu the night prior so I was pretty excited.. I didn't even know it existed til then.. greeted by the host and served by Sam., who was wonderful.. very attentive and Informative. 
We ordered the scallops. I really like it. However, it came with the hummus. And I didn't care for that. The scallops were nicely sear and warm. The hummus wasn't even room temperature. It was frig cool.. it threw me off. 
I then order lobster raviolis. It wasn't something memorable where I have to come back for but it was comforting and filling. 
The chocolate cake was a failed. I took 2 bites maybe. It was overly dry. It crumbled completely. Wasn't to liking at all. 
I would like to come back and try other dishes. Like their drinks menu is pretty cool and the bartender is willing to accommodate you., But I really hope they work on the dessert menu!"}
{"text":"Experienced Ilios Noche for the first time last night and they did not disappoint. The atmosphere is great, the service is top notch and the food was unbelievable!  All three owners stopped by our table and introduced themselves and brought us an appetizer on the house for being first timers! Truly a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"This review was submitted by my Mother! -I left myself signed in on her iPad. LOL

After seven years living in Charlotte and always looking for a place that cooks what they say is their specialty, again, the same problem that I've encountered in many other restaurants here in Charlotte, Ilios Noche lived to my personal observation, neither Greek nor Italian, from the appetizer Saganaki, -C, salad $7.50 very small and underdressed, then the entrees came, preparation and visual failed miserably, my husband ordered Moussaka, it was served cold, what a mess, the only thing Greek in that dish was the spelling, I made the mistake in ordering the Greek style pork ribs, wow, the seasoning was so minimal, no enough salt and pepper and a few oregano leaves, it should have been marinated in lemon, olive oil, plenty of garlic and oregano with grated Roma tomatoes and grilled and smothered with in their juice, served on a bed of rice/potatoes and roasted vegetables, no that thing they served me, the portion was enormous, who eat that much meat. I took it home, I have a dog that loves meat and not as informed in world cuisine.  In our way home I stopped in a store for while and when I got back to car the smell was so bad that I thought not even my dog was going to eat it, I was wrong, he is a dog and he ate it, I guess that was the only complimentary critique of this meal, and what I don't understand is, why don't they have salt and pepper shakers on the table, believe me, it may help, then, have their chefs travel, all expenses paid, to Greece for cooking lessons, and then, maybe then, they will deserve to get paid for what they are serving, just saying.....one star for ambience."}
{"text":"This is the most UNWELCOMING restaurant I have been to! First, the older woman that was a hostess just gave me a blank stare when I walked in like what do you want. I asked for a table and she walked me to a table with an attitude. Next, the waiter with a 'unique' looking mustache approached me also with a nasty attitude. He asked me what I wanted to drink and I told him water. He asked if I wanted lemon and I said no thank you. He brought my water with a huge piece of lemon. He hesitated as he was putting the water down realizing his mistake. He just placed the water down and NEVER returned to take my order. This was around 2:20pm on 6/19/18 and the side where I was sitting was practically empty! There were only two other tables being occupied. He walked past me like 3 times completely ignoring me. I saw him approaching the guests that were seated behind me asking if they needed anything but he completely refused to take my order. I decided to just leave. On my way out, I saw a petite woman that looked at me with a concerned look on her face. I asked if she worked there and she said yes. I told her I decided to leave since my waiter never came back to take my order. She apologized and offered to take my order herself. I told her no thank you because I needed to get back to work. I'm not sure if she was a manager or not. If she's not, she needs to be promoted and train the rest of the staff on the PROPER way to treat their customers!!  The waiter with the 'unique' mustache may need to be transitioned to the back away from the customers."}
{"text":"Wow amazing service by Kyle and food suggestions. Manager Aaron attended to all guests. Hidden classy gem in this shopping center. Excellent selection of wines, beers and mixed spirits. I had delicious salad and a lamb dish that just melted in your mouth. Found this place on Yelp traveling around SC and NC from San Diego."}
{"text":"The food and service here are always fantastic. It's sometimes hard to get a table on weekend nights, so I recommend calling ahead for a reservation. Live music on weekends is always enjoyable and the atmosphere is great. 
It's not overly fancy. I wouldn't feel comfortable walking in wearing jeans and a tshirt, but have seen some pretty casual diners there.
I love the pizzas, but you can't go wrong with any menu selection. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I hosted a client appreciation luncheon at Ilios and thanks to Jonathan Meeks the event coordinator it went off with a hitch.  The food and service were great!!  Recommend to any company for a great event!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I'd leave it at that, but Yelp requires a long review. The lamb burger is probably their most-ordered dish, and it's so good. Overall, this place serves quality, elevated Mediterranean food with a twist. The atmosphere is open and inviting. It's beautiful. I love sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Simply scrumptious! Absolutely delicious! My sister and I had the opportunity to dine outdoors again and couldn't be more thrilled with our menu selections: kale salad - loved the roasted beets; spinach pie - devoured it. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service. Everything is always hot. The zucchini and eggplant chips are to die for. Their pizza is really good and the sauce is sweet which really makes the dish. Make sure to get s reservation on the weekends."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best meals my family and I have had in awhile!  From the lamb chops to the  scallops to the souvlaki sandwhich, our entire party of four were so pleased.  Our waiter, Billy, made great suggestions and took fabulous care of us!  Even his wine recommendation was spot on.  We've visited Ilios Noche several times in the last year and have never been disappointed.  We have crowned it our new \"go to\" spot!  Oh... Do yourself a  favor and try the au gratin cauliflower!  :)"}
{"text":"This is a fair restaurant. Not great but ok. Atmosphere is nice and the dining room is comfortable. Service is pretty good. Not a very polished or professional staff, but they're nice and helpful. Food is meh. Place seems dressed up but the substance doesn't have the focus."}
{"text":"My unrefined palate could be mistaken, but I think Ilios Noche is terrific and deserves all the great reviews you see on Yelp. They are masters of perfect seasoning. 

Not only some of the best food in Charlotte, our server was extremely helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Don't let the location throw you off. The food is excellent and so is atmosphere. Try out the lamb burger - it is wonderful."}
{"text":"We came late afternoon for a late lunch.  It was fairly empty.  Had a gyro & really enjoyed it.  The fries were golden & crispy."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a nice ambience and  we were seated at the nice booth. The lunch menu had significantly less selections than the dinner menu which was disappointing. Regardless, we decided what to order. It took almost 20 minutes after we were seated for the waitress to come and greet us and asked for drinks. Once she took the order the appetizers were brought fairly soon to us and tasted yummy. The main course was brought soon after. The falafel pita sandwich was a little dry and I asked the waitress for some extra taziki sauce and she brought some for an extra 1$. I never saw a restaurant charge extra money for a tablespoon of extra taziki sauce. Overall, the food wasn't bad but the service was disappointing."}
{"text":"Absolutely a shockingly GREAT meal! I knew it would be good, but not THIS good! Hey we were both amazingly happy!

First off the staff is very professional.....very young but very professional. They did make a few execution errors (like couldn't fine the right table throughout the night) but hey, that didn't detract one bit from the awsome meal we had.

First off we started with their Burrata mozzarella...which, for those of you unfamiliar with this unctuous dish, is a mozzarella cheese stuffed with cream and milk. It's outrageously delicious! They served this app with fresh heirloom tomatoes and a balsamic glaze. Oh so yummy!

Then my date got the Veal Chop and I got the Scallop special. OMG were both awesome! She got the Veal Chop done Med Rare and the outside was perfectly seared while the inside velvety soft. This was served over a bed of sauteed mushrooms which my date didn't care for (it's a female-texture thing....) but I gladly wolfed down!

I got the Scallop special, servered over an eggplant puree. The scallops were perfectly done, and seasoned to perfection. We both agreed that this dish was one of the best each of us has had in months!

Then for the finale.....we got their signature BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE and PISTACHIO TORTA, topped with passion fruit sorbet, made by their Pastry Chef, Frank Kaltsounis. Let me tell you....I'm somewhat of a dessert snob/harsh critic but I couldn't find one flaw in this dessert! It was PERFECTION! They somehow got 2 layers of chocolate moose over a pistachio crust, and topped it with a Mango puree! It should not work but it was AMAZING! Anyone reading this review needs to go there and try it and let me know what you think! It was I believe the best dessert I've had in my 3.5 years in Charlotte, and I've had a LOT of desserts!

We ordered WAYYYYY to much wine which drove the bill much higher than I would have liked. BUT, they DO have a fabulous wine list.....just don't order the 8 glasses like we did and you're bill will be reasonable. But that was our fault....a \"fault\" I could live with. 

Our waitress Alyssa was a doll, and superbly nice. The Manager came by and chatted with us, making sure we were happy and also was very professional and cordial.

Overall, this was an extraordinary meal! It's right up there with Good Food, Carpe Diem and Soul. This is a MUST TRY restaurant! Way to go Ilios Noche Quail Co!"}
{"text":"Perfect, I simply love it. Try the lamb burger, you'll thank me!

There are very few options as pleasant as this. You need a reservation on the weekends, but weeknights or lunch are usually ok. 

A wide variety on the menu, something for every taste."}
{"text":"I think they have pretty good Greek food, not out-of-this-world good, but decent and some dishes are excellent.

The octopus appetizer was excellent and ditto the dolmaties.  If you are a novice to Greek food, do the four starter/dip plate that is a selection of humus, egg plant, peppers along with pita bread.  You can get regular or whole wheat pitas.

Crazy lasagna is unique and very delicious.  My friend had a big salad and it looked fantastic and he said it was one of the best he ever had.

Menu is Mediterranean and covers quite a variety of dishes. Portions are generous.

Hard to comment of describe other than to say that the service is great, selections many, prices reasonable and everything is savory.  Treat yourself to a selection of appetizers and you will have a great experience and learn something about Greek food.

Good place."}
{"text":"It is a hit or miss with the place. Been here twice. Came for lunch and place was busy. Hostess distracted and busy with the phone and other things. Waiter came over and asked what you wanted. I had to ask for water twice thought he forgot and waiting for a while. Waiter said he wanted to wait for the Cosmo and then bring it together with the water. Waiter asked you want vodka in the Cosmo which I thought was odd. I asked if he was making the Cosmo and he said no. Said I prefer Grey Goose or Stoli. Waiter was definitely not on his A game today.

The server who brought food to the table were more interactive and attentive. 

The falafel sandwich was good nicely wrapped in parchment paper and salad was fresh.

When we asked for check. Waiter had to double check with us with what we ordered. 

Owners of this restaurant is the same as Big View Diner. Prefer wait staff and hostesses from the Big View Diner they are just the best. Servers here do a better job."}
{"text":"There was more than an hour to kill before the movie.  I asked her 'are you hungry?'.  So I looked up for food around in Yelp and to my surprise, there is a Greek food place within 10 minutes drive from the theatre.  Surprised to find there is a Greek place that we have not even heard of (we love Mediterranean food!!).  The reviews, the pictures of the restaurant pushed us to go ahead and give it a shot.
One of THE BEST restaurants for interior d√©cor, obviously I have no idea who the interior decorator is but hats off to that person.  It was a perfect blend of classy and industrial look.  Huge fan of wooden panel walls and those huge light fixtures.  
We sat at the bar and our bartender Emily - she is probably one of the main reasons we loved the place and the food.  She was so passionate in explaining their menu and questions that we asked.  Very attentive, responsive, engaging, checking on us periodically.  
Food - Complimentary Red roasted peppers spread with pita was damn good (you get couple other options for spread as well).  The spinach pie was such a surprise (at least to us) because this was the first time trying that out and it was delicious.  Emily suggested to have it served with a side of Tzatziki sauce and WOW, that Tzatziki was super fresh and tops all other places I had Tzatziki from.  We just had beers and did not try any cocktails or other drinks.
Great place for a classy dinner, family dinners or just hanging out with friends, plenty outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Wow, used to be a fan of this place, but it's gone downhill quickly.  On past experiences the bar service was good, the food consistent, and the responsiveness up to par.  I've been twice this week, thinking it was an anomaly, but they've let me down twice in a row.  The bartender, a gentleman from New York, never once acknowledged me to begin with until I asked for a drink and subsequently ignored an empty glass of beer and water... Unless I asked.  Additionally, I ordered a half order of pasta and salad to go and waited for nearly 70 minutes for it to be ready!!!  The worst part.... Never once was I checked on, approached to discuss the delay, or even asked if I would like something while waiting.  Within a few months Waverly will open and later the development behind.  I hope Ilios has a plan to step up the game or they WILL go out of business in this location.  The food isn't that good, the prices are high, and the service is horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Very close to work, they have wonderful fun friendly staff and can get you in and out when on lunch break, which is a huge plus in my book. Everything I've tried has been wonderful from salad or pizza to lasagna... And everything in between!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding? This place is awesome... we've been living in the Carolina's for about a month and a half now and this place is by far one of the best places that we've been to. The staff is unbelievably knowledgeable and friendly. The food is amazing. We had the quinoa salad to start. Then the fig pizza and falafel platter to share. Make sure to ask for extra tzatziki sauce for the falafel. Otherwise it's perfect. I could eat here for lunch or dinner every day of the week and I'd still be ready to go back for more."}
{"text":"I'm doubling up on my review from their other location since we've tried both of their locations and they're both amazing:

{"text":"Yesterday I had a wonderful lunch at Ilios Noche at Quail Corners. The lunchtime special was tempting (3-course meal for $10), but so was the rest of the menu, and so I ordered from that. I mentioned to the waiter that this was my first visit, and to welcome me he offered me my choice of their 4 spreads, on the house. It was hard to choose, but I selected the melitzanosalata with carrot and celery sticks. He brought a generous portion, and I found the balance of roasted eggplant, walnuts, red onion, and mint very refreshing. I had to make myself leave room for my entree, the Ilios Platter with chicken souvlaki. Glad I did, because it came with 2 generous skewers of well-trimmed, marinated grilled chicken, accompanied by a salad of cucumber, tomato, feta, red onion, and olives in a tasty vinaigrette. There also was a mound of saut√©ed slices of new potatoes, drizzled with olive oil and herbs, and a large dollop of real tzatziki sauce (no sour cream in sight). Rounding it out was a dish of hot, fresh pita bread. I came hungry (no breakfast), but I still couldn't eat it all. Add to this the great decor and an attentive and personable staff, and I couldn't ask for  better, but I did get more. I ordered a dessert to-go. Much later - in place of supper - I dug into that. It was a scrumptious combination of angel food cake with a fluffy filling, toasted coconut, and passion fruit sorbet. Am I gushing?  Yeah, but it was that good."}
{"text":"This stands out as one of the best places we've eaten in Charlotte. We stumbled across this place tonight since we were going next door for trivia. The service was excellent and personable and the food was great. They really take care of you here. I also liked the menu had a range of dishes and prices, so it would be a great place to bring a group of friends. We will definitely be back to try more of the offerings."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time this week and really loved it! The menu has a great variety for people that like meat or vegetarian dishes. The portion sizes are large. On Tuesdays they offer half price bottles of wine, which is awesome. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive and the food was great. I highly recommend trying this place out. I'm looking forward to going back and trying many other dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious! If you are looking for greek food, this is your place. The service and food were excellent. We decided to give Illios Noche a try for lunch. I had the falafel pita sandwich with greek fries. My boyfriend had the lamb with broccolini and quinoa-farro salad. We really enjoyed both plates. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"A little pricey with drinks and all included, but well worth it! On a friday night, they had an awesome band, great service and even better food."}
{"text":"The wait was long because we didn't have reservations. Our waitress Mary was very nice and attentive. The kitchen was completely off though. There were 4 of us and when the entree came we only got 3...we waited and waited for the 4th and finally had to send back the scallops with risotto. Sadly when they came back the risotto was cold and they gave us the same scallops retired. Too bad because everything else was delish. 
The manager gave us our appetizers and a card for the next time. We don't live here though...:-("}
{"text":"Luckily for us, Mediterranean restaurants are suddenly plentiful in Charlotte and quite frankly most of them are good to very good, which is also the case with Ilios Noche. This location is by far the more comfortable and visually appealing of its two locations. The dining room is quite stunning and is as beautiful as found any anywhere in the city. The service was courteous and attentive on both the Saturday evenings that we dined there. We unfortunately had issues with the food on both occasions.

We started things off with the Mesclun Salad with baby greens, Gorgonzola cheese, candied walnuts, white balsamic vinaigrette. At $8 it is a little pricey; however, it did deliver portion size-wise and was generous with the walnuts and Gorgonzola. The vinaigrette was very tasty but applied too heavily; my mistake however, as I should have ordered it on the side. 

I can't go to a Greek restaurant without ordering falafel and that was the case here also. At the very reasonable price of $5, five pieces are served alongside their beautiful tzatziki sauce. As my photo shows, it was artfully displayed however it was a little bland for my taste and was overwhelmed by garlic. This could be chalked up to personal preference but of the eleven area Greek/Mediterranean restaurants that my wife and I have dined over the past year, this falafel was our least favorite.

What cannot be attributed to personal preference however is the two burnt skewers of grossly overcooked tiny lamb kabobs that was served with my Lamb Souvlaki platter. As any Greek chef knows, lamb should be cooked medium rare to medium, yet mine was cooked well done (see photo). I would have normally sent it back but we were running late for church and just didn't have time. The accompanying country Greek salad and Greek fries were excellent. In fact the fries were the best I've had anywhere but such a major mistake on the lamb preparation is hard to overlook and weighs heavily in my overall score. The Pita bread was unspectacular to say the least. (What qualifies Pita bread as spectacular you might ask... see my review for Kabob Je Rotisserie in Matthews, NC for that answer - theirs is out of this world and worth the 10 minute drive.)

On the plus side, the the Wild Mushroom Ravioli at $11 was expertly prepared and very savory. Serving size was small but this was reflected in the price. Loved it so much I was tempted to lick the plate

Overall everything was just okay at best, which is disappointing because, based on prior reviews, our expectations were quite high. Due to the better alternatives I mentioned at the beginning of this review, we probably won't return, but it's still worth a try I think if you haven't been before. I just hope your experience is better than our two visits. The odds, based on other reviews, it probably will be."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and glad we did.

I had this on my list of places to visit for sometime now but finally made it. I'm President of a HOA in Cornelius and we're getting ready to do some renovations and one of the bidders just finished doing the same type of work less than a mile from here. I volunteered to come down and take some pictures and guess what, accomplished two things today.

As we walked up the door, the hostess on the inside opened the door from my wife and myself and invited us in. Good Start. Then she escorted us to our table and our server showed up a short time later with ice water and menus. We gave our beverage orders and when he returned we had decided on what we wanted for lunch and with this menu with so many choices, it was difficult.

My wife took a chance of ordered Scallops over Risotto. The reason I said took a chance is that she rarely orders Scallops because the tend to be either over cooked and hard and rubbery or under cooked and a bit on the slimy side.  These were perfect and she ate everything on her plate. She's on a diet and rarely eats an entire course. The Mushroom Risotto which was the base for the Scallops was excellent.

I had the Lamb Burger with a side of Fries.  I normally order Lamb cooked medium rare to medium because it's too easy to over cook. This burger came out great. Full of flavor, juicy and a taste treat.  It was accented with Feta Cheese as well. The Fries were not the Shoe String cut we normally get but rather sliced potatoes that were fried and they were delicious.

In the course of lunch, the manager came over and inquired if we were satisfied which is normally the hallmark of a well run restaurant. Good hands on touch by all of the staff.

Good Food, great service and a nice atmosphere and next time, I won't need an excuse to drop in just because I was in the neighborhoo."}
{"text":"I've been to their other location in Matthews NC, 20 min South of here, I was impressed with that location and decided to give a shot at this place, the ambience between the two restaurants is almost identical, with excellent service in both locations. 
Here I had the NC Trout with Greek potatoes and arugula,it was muah, light, good portion size, it felt like home made, but better. 
Their Baklava with Ice Cream is great.  
Definitely recommend this place. I'll try their brunch next time."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! Food selection, food quality, service, and the dining environment are all excellent! Our family has tried several items from the menu and not one has left us wishing we hadn't ordered it! We do have some favorites... We always order the Zucchini and Eggplant chips; just terrific! I really enjoy their Mesclun Salads and the Crazy Lasagna. I could go on... but you get the point, I recommend this place! Oh, and if you \"partake\" check out the \"Smokey (in the Rye)\" cocktail!!"}
{"text":"As usual, great food.  Showcasing high quality ingredients and classic greek / mediterranean flavors."}
{"text":"We live near Uptown but wanted to try something new, and this place got 500+ great reviews on Open Table. It was fantastic! We tried a little bit of everything. The lamb burger was exceptional. We enjoyed the goat cheese stuffed peppers and falafel as apps. I'd probably pass on the hummus next time because it was a bit different and I'm a fan of more traditional hummus, but it wasn't bad. I got a cocktail and it was great, and my boyfriend was happy with their draft beer selection. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable about the
menu as well. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  You usually need a reservation.  Friday and saturday can be a 1+hour wait without it.  The food is excellent.  We eat here all the time.  Our favorite things:Htipiti, lamb sovlaki, wild mushroom pizza, greek ribs, and pretty much all the deserts."}
{"text":"I walked in this restaurant and sat down and got my menus and water after 15 minutes!  And the service
Was horrendous the waiter came every 30 minutes and when we gave the waitress our bill back she gave us our change after 30 minutes! The food was amazing but it is the shittiest service I have ever seen in my life! I'm never going to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Bryan was our server and he was fabulous. As someone visiting Charlotte, I appreciated that the Manager/Owner walked around and greeted every table, and checked to make sure everything was OK. As a matter of fact, the table next to us seemed to be regulars, and it felt like a place locals go to frequently. The ribs were quite tender, and the Brussel Sprouts were very good! Tuesdays half off bottles of wine, so take advantage!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. BeAutiful atmosphere. Wonderful wait staff. I had the Mediterranean spreads (all four) and my friends had the salmon sandwich and the grilled chicken pita. Everything was absolutely delicious. My new favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"The 1st time I ate here I loved almost everything, the 2nd time it was all a  bit mediocre. Our server the 2nd time was a little off.  He was awkward and would kind of stand around and wait for our reactions about a drink or food and it made it a little uncomfortable.  But the prices are reasonable and they do have a large menu so there would definitely be lots of other options to try than the things I've had and didn't love.   I haven't given up on it but I wouldn't rush to get back there any time soon."}
{"text":"I know people who like this place, in fact a few of my close friends think this is their favorite place. Me - no. It's not that great. I had a flat bread type pizza for lunch that was covered in some greens - I mean COVERED ! haha. Now I didn't think much of it until I got about half way through - I started thinking to myself - \"Self, is this any better than the flat bread pizza I had the other day at Chili's?\" Well - sadly the answer was \"No self. No self it is not.\"

So if you can't do better than Chili's why am I going here? 

This was the second visit. The other time was not any better. Some people like it though - so you might just be 'one of THOSE' people. haha"}
{"text":"Another great meal at Ilios Noche Quail Corners.  Garganelli Pasta with Chicken was very tasty. Also, I highly recommend the Capellini with scallops (Pasta) is heavenly.  Service by Erin and George was courteous, professional, and attentive.!    BRAVO!"}
{"text":"Would give them negative stars if I could.  Have been coming here for a decade and always enjoyed the food.  Tried to take my parents in town from Oklahoma to enjoy a super early dinner (5:15pm) on a Friday night but were turned away.  We were greeted without a smile - \"do you have a reservation?\".  I scanned the huge dining area to see maybe 12 folks seated of their just about 300 person dining capacity.  \"No, we do not but hoping you can fit us in\".  After 2 other ladies joined the stand and conferred, I was told the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes because they are completely booked up and just waiting on people to show.  Not offered a seat at the bar to wait.  Just a good ol' fashioned No.  I asked why 30 minutes since I doubted all the people about to show up would be cleared out in 20 minutes or less?  Why not just let us sit at one of those tables that are kept back by the bathroom for just in case situations...or as a hedge assuming one of the 60 (give or take) tables that apparently were fully reserved would not show up...she was super confused and told me \"I dunno\".

My message to the fantastic restaurant manager at Ilios Noche off Providence - You lost a very long time patron due to the absolute easiest thing to get right.  Your food is amazing, wait staff is always on, wine list is well put together and very reasonable, but....the folks at the front of the house were both cold and irrational.  Good luck."}
{"text":"I have been coming to ilios for years, and the ilios salad with grilled chicken is my absolute weakness. Their food is always fresh and delicious. I'm not sure how I feel about the new menus, but luckily I'm still able to order their old dishes (like the baked goat cheese and marinara appetizer!!). My favorite place for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"My dad and I went here one night and one of the best Mediterranean places I have ever been to. All the ingredients were so fresh and prepared wonderfully. I am definitely looking forward to my next visit here. A little pricey but the quality is on par with the price.

We started with the Roasted Red Pepper 'Htipiti': barrel-aged feta, chili pepper, arbequina olive oil. Awesome spread to begin the meal.

Then we split the LAMB 'Youvetsi Me Manestra' slow braised lamb shank,
tomato shallot orzo, mizithra cheese. 

And the PAN ROASTED CORVINA greek risotto cake, grilled ratatouille vegetables, aged balsamic. Hard to say which one was better both blasting with flavor the lamb was so tender and the corvina was moist.

Next time you're in the mood for some Mediterranean can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Had the eggplant and zucchini chips and loved them! Very thin, light, not greasy and the yogurt sauce was perfect. Then did a 3 side platter of risotto, mushrooms and cabbage olive salad which I loved! Lemon and olive oil cabbage with a few calamata olive slices was so light and fresh. The risotto was cooked to perfection, creamy but not overpowering and buttery. The mushrooms were one of my favorites really enjoyed the reduction they'd saut√©ed them in. Finally they gave me a sample of cream of spinach and Greek lemon soups. Lemon is in everything I cook and drink so you know which one I chose but the spinach was creamy but not heavy and would have made a great lunch choice all on its own. Overall - 5 stars! Loved the inside of the place too and there is seating outside. Classy, clean, warm I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My wife took me to Ilios Noche for my 40th birthday.  The food was exceptional and the service was second to none.  Our waitress Nadia went above and beyond as did the bartender and a few other staff who were just checking in.  We will definitely be back to try more of that awesome looking menu."}
{"text":"The combination of Great food (appetizer of 4 amazing spreads and bread, along with an entree of Lamb Chops) and great service (very attentive wait staff who were quick to provide excellent recommendations) make this one of the top 5 restaurants we've visited since moving to the CLT area. We will definitely be making this a regular restaurant for Greek/Italian."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restraunt for a while.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised at the transformation!!  A VERY nice expansion and redecorating!  We were seated upon arrival and our waitress was very attentive.  She brought our drinks in a timely manner along with our Goat cheese dip appetizer which was amazing!   I ordered the Brick Pressed Chicken...was very delicious and moist.  My daughter got the Margarita pizza and salad...very nicely flavored.  Our water glasses were filled several times.  I will definitely be going back for a date night meal with my husband!!!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover.  This place tucked away in a little shopping center next to all of your average stores - Harris Teeter, Rite Aid, TCBY, etc.  Step foot inside, and wow.  The bar curves around and looks really inviting.  It is very cozy inside with wood panel walls, cushiony  booths and dim lighting.  There was even live music on the Monday night we went.  A tad too loud, but still a nice touch.   Service was great.  

Lots of delicious appetizers and small plates to share.  Don't miss the Burrata Mozzarella with shaved prosciutto.  YUM!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite date night locations. A wonderful place to enjoy a glass of wine and some risotto. Love the spinach pie too!"}
{"text":"Great experience -- we will be going back!  Great food and service!  The scallops with mushroom risotto was excellent! My husband had the lamb shank and that was also excellent!"}
{"text":"Awesome service! The manager came and asked us about our food and it wasn't as good as I thought, so he served me my favorite scallops instead. They were very nice and accommodating. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I would rate this place 4.5! The total experience here is near perfect.  From the selection of wines to the choice of menu items paired with a simple, rustic ambience; every detail seems to be carefully chosen and it pays off! The al fresco seating matches. The service,  so attentive and kind. I am very happy to have this establishment in my back yard!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this restaurant and the service provided really makes you want to return when celebrating something. Everyone just seems to have a passion for the food and take such great care to ensure everything is as expected. Such great food and really wonderful service. We return again and again as a result!"}
{"text":"We take out or come here after church every month or two. From an appearance standpoint it's a nice middle of the road establishment. The Crazy Lasagna and Garganelli (excellent ragu) are both absolutely outstanding."}
{"text":"Pros:

Great Patio dinning for this time of year
Great Service
Dessert was good had the trio platter
Half Price wine night on Tuesdays and good wine selection at decent prices

Middle Ground:

Mezze Dip platter
aah  it was OK. Nothing to write home about. Have had better dips before. The tzatziki was nice though. Eggplant dip was not what I was used to having visited Greece and Turkey

Not so Good:

The flounder. It was SUPER dry. Like fried beyond all recognition. The sauces were nice that came with it but there wasn't enough. Both me and my friend had the same platter and both used our mezz dips to drown the fish in. Neither one of us finished the fish. Could have used more artichokes in the potato, salad artichoke thing which was mostly just potatoes and nothing spectacular about that either. 

Other issue I had was that our entrees came out to soon we had barely recieved our dips when the entree came out.

Overall would recommend the place just not the flounder."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp would allow for multiple ratings on different categories. The food is good, nothing to invite out of town guests but it's a solid 3.5. 

The service is great. The staff there are consistently friendly and appearance is professional. I'd rate them very high, a solid 4 or higher. 

I have an issue with management. We've dined here seven times, mostly lunches but a couple of dinners. One three occasions I've actually witnessed management berating their staff, using expletives and gestures that drew much attention from customers. Later I found out that it was the manager and the owner on another occasion. 

Perhaps in Greece (owner) or France (manager) you can get away with that type of belligerent behavior but this is America. Not only that, it's the South!  Watch your back."}
{"text":"We dined here last evening and totally enjoyed Ilios Noche!! It was me along with my wife, two daughters and their boyfriends. We started with 2 orders each of the olives, dolmades, and the goat stuffed peppers. Each were delicious. I had the Lamb Souvlaki platter, and the wife had the Falafel Platter. The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable. I see us dining here regularly. Great dining experience!!"}
{"text":"So what can I say about this place?!?!....it's \"fancy\" and not your typical \"blue collar\" come after work spot. My family and I came in for our weekly Takeout Tuesday meal so we were not properly dressed. But none the less we went inside and was promptly seated. The ambience is beautiful and they have outdoor seating. This is a wonderful place for date night and in my opinion not for a random evening out with the family. See we like to play games at the table since we have a no phone policy while out(sometimes we slip up). Getting back to the food!!!! Amazing!!!! It needed up being a great night out despite my apprehension. Our Server was prompt and very attentive. There's also tv's if you sit at the bar. I can't say how the drinks were because it was a water night for me. Will definitely try this place again sans children"}
{"text":"The service here is outstanding. Every time we've been I would've tipped 100% (if I could afford it). Very consistent with level of service, hospitality, and great food. This place is unique and really impressive. On a side note, the bar is beautiful! 
Love the stuffed grape tomatoes"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service was wonderful.   Elegant meal for a good price.  Will certainly be coming back. Had our Easter brunch meal there today!  Exceptional!!"}
{"text":"Dined on Veterans Day. Kudos to Ilios for recognizing veterans with a free entree. Surprisingly our server was unaware of this promotion.  All was ok after he checked with management. I had the crazy lasagna, plenty there but for me just ok. Still love their Ilios salad. My wife had a cucumber and tomato salad with grilled chicken. Their chicken is very good. Topped it off with a peach cannoli, excellent."}
{"text":"oh geez!  left over lamb from the weekend I guess, for the special, 4-29-14.  Terrible! with pasta, red pepper, asparagus, etc. I did not taste any of those. Lamb was garbage leftover little chunks.  Absolutely awful!!! I was too tired to complain.   Last 2 times we went there, Not good!  Scallop appetizer, ok..  not as good as it used to be.
Arugala salad with melon. My husband made the mistake of ordering arugala.   Too bitter, maybe 1\" of melon.  Not enough to even know it was in there.  How much does a little pc. of melon cost?  
awful!  No bread. 
$ 91.00  plus tip, $100.00+  and I had to go home and eat."}
{"text":"The kale salad was amazing!!! I ordered the goat cheese stuffed peppers and didn't care for them but I think I just don't like that type of pepper. My husband liked the peppers as leftovers :) It was a good atmosphere and they have signature drinks which is fun."}
{"text":"I finally made it to this location!  Super close to my office.  I believe this location is larger then the providence Rd one and just as good.  I came here on Wednesday when the drinks were half price.  The bartender was super friendly and the drinks were excellent, no surprise.  The bartender even gave me my choice of alcohol for the cocktail(for an up charge) which was nice.  My friend and I sampled the Italian style meatballs which were AMAZING! The cod fritters(not my fave), the giant Tuscan white beans....INCREDIBLE!!! Actually I have been back about 4 times and each time I HAVE to get the beans! This location actually Ames then better than the other location(trust me, I've tried more than once). My only gripe is that they have taken my favorite drink off of the menu so I am going to start the hashtag #bringbacktheardreypear !  But I am obsessed with Ilios Noche and all my friends know it!"}
{"text":"Yum and Yey!!! I think I've found my spot!! Since visiting for the first time back in February, I have been back about 8 times, making Ilios Noche my go to lunch meeting, afternoon cocktail, night time boo time spot!  The atmosphere is nice, service is consistent, drinks are tasty and the food is delicious.  I've tried almost all of the small plates and all were pretty tasty.  The zucchini and eggplant chips are my fave followed by the four spreads and the saganaki which is a strange cheese dish is oddly delicious, odd because ive never tasted anything like it but delicious nonetheless.  I was not impressed by the pork ribs and found them to be a bit bland.  The angry shrimp however were yummy.  Falafel was fried to perfection and good.  I can't wait to try the octopus... Probably on my next visit.  My favorite salad is the Ilios to which I've added a delicious lamb skewer.  The flatbread with arugula and fig is a winner and you can't go wrong with the Lamb shank.  Have I convinced you yet that I'm a fan?!  If not maybe the Brazilian dude who is crooning live on Saturday nights will.  He is amazing!  Oh but there's more!  They have drink specials... Wednesday cocktails are half price.  Have the Ardrey pear and thank me later.  My husband usually gets a smokey on the rye which has a pretty cool presentation if you are into fancy cocktails.  My only negative thing about this place is that it can get a bit pricey if you like to try a bit of everything like me but who fault is that?  Also the service can get a little spotty during busy times.  Ooooh I almost forgot about the heavenly apple crisp dessert!!! SO GOOOOD and a nice shareable size. trust me when I say this place is a south Charlotte gem!"}
{"text":"We came for the \"make your own pizza\" night and had mixed views.   In a nutshell we paid $20 to each put our own topping on an 8 inch pizza before eating it.  About 35 people were in a confined space with seating for, at most, only half the group.  It took about 2 hours in total and the initial wait was long.  Net, it was kinda fun but at an unreasonable cost and not particularly well organized.  I would not recommend this event."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than five stars I would, I just stumbled on this amazing Mediterranean/Greek restaurant, the food is fresh, light, and above all tasty and yummy, honestly I think I just found new favorite place to eat. 
The chicken lemon soup is awesome, perfect texture, it is not too rich. 
The salmon sandwich is one of a kind, the bread has little bit of sweetness to it. 
I'm really impressed with the Chef in this place. 
Please keep up the great work."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place!  It was our first time there last night and I already can't wait to go back.  Our  waitress was so helpful and had great recommendations, we took her word and were blown away.  You can really taste the home made sauces and fresh ingredients, just thinking about it it making my mouth water.  On top of the great service and food, the owner offered desserts for the table on the house!  Loved every bite and so did the rest of the table."}
{"text":"Went here solo because I was craving the Greek style ribs with tzatiki (stunningly good combo, btw). Ilios is so postively reliable - service, atmosphere, food. . .even free wi-fi! Everything was top notch and the ribs really did hit the spot!

Make sure you order the eggplant chips to start - very unusual appetizer but very tasty!"}
{"text":"Really like the decor at this location. The service was excellent and the food was really good. 

I think I can come here just to have the octopus appetizer and be fully satisfied. It is so tasty and it almost melts in your mouth since it is so tender."}
{"text":"The fella and I grabbed drinks with friends on a Wednesday night, and then had dinner on our own. I was a little intrigued to see if the staff treated us weirdly since we weren't regulars, but all was well!

The place was hopping with live music happening in the bar, and we bellied right up. The bartender was pleasant and fast, and my most favorite part was that they had hooks under the bar for purses!

The fella and I moseyed over to the restaurant side for dinner, and our waiter was so sweet! We ordered hummus to start out with ($3.50), and it came with pita points that looked maybe like they were pumpernickel? Pretty tasty. For dinner, the fella got the lamb burger ($13.50), and I got the grapes and fennel salad with grilled chicken ($12.50). The fella said the lamb burger was even better than The Liberty's, which is high praise indeed. I can attest to the Greek fries being awesome - they were more like thick slices of potatoes with olive oil and feta cheese. YUM. The salad was delicious, too.

Overall, a solid addition to Quail Corners and a seriously under served part of south Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Ilios Noche since they renovated, but my fella and I decided to go for Sunday brunch.  Their Facebook page, Open Table reservations and Google search page all said they opened at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday, but their website and the brunch menu on their website said 10:00 a.m.  We got there at 10 a.m. on Sunday, and the hours on the outside of the restaurant said they opened at 11:00.  We called from the parking lot to ask what time they really opened, and it took the girl who answered a few minutes to confirm that they did, in fact, open at 10:00.  No wonder we were the only people in there!  

Besides that bit of confusion, the breakfast was great.  I loved the new decor; it looks completely different!  The reds, oranges and browns/grays made it feel much cozier than before.  We both got the Ilios breakfast, but I got scrambled eggs and bacon whereas fella got over-well eggs and grilled sausage.  The sausage was almost like a brat - thick and a little spicy.  He loved it, but it was just a smidgen spicy for me for breakfast (but I'm a wimp).  He also loved the fresh-squeezed orange juice.  Talk about going above and beyond!  The breakfast potatoes were out of this world with onions, peppers and garlic.  The panzino toast was uneventful; some jam would've helped, but it was pretty bland on its own.

Ilios Noche is a little out of the way for us, but after we got home I read that another location is opening in Quail Corners this spring, which will be much closer to us.  I (and my stomach) can't wait!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fantastic atmosphere. Tasty drinks. My only criticism is that the staff wears way too much perfume. The bus boy reeked of Axe body spray. The server was wearing way too much Victoria secret body spray. Being pregnant it made me queasy."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!!

Went Saturday night with another couple, the food was great. They had a James
Beard chef visiting and the only special was his Baklava (yum)

Wife got the lamb chops based on the waiter saying they had mint jelly to go with it.  Chops arrived, no mint jelly, they searched and searched, they were out.  Five minutes later they show up with mint jelly, manager had sent someone over to HT next door to buy some for her.  Great Service!!

The only reason not a fifth star is that it was my first time there, need to see consistency to earn that.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently had dinner here for the first time and are wondering what took us so long to try it out. We loved it. We had a drink at the bar before we sat down. The bartender was prompt and made delicious drinks. The hostesses were super friendly and on top of everything despite being super busy on a Saturday night. Ernesto, our server, was awesome. He made great recommendations and was very attentive without being overbearing. The food was delicious. I had the branzino & it was cooked to perfection. They have a decent wine list with Belle Glos and The Prisoner by the glass. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has the some of the best customer service that I have seen in a long while. First time I came to this place, my mom had recently had knee surgery and we  had little expectations for a quick lunch. Not only were they prompt and very accommodating, but this place really makes you feel valued as a customer!!! Not only that but the food is amazing. My favorite for lunch is the chicken caprese panini and either the lemon chicken soup or the ginger carrot soup are absolutely divine. I swear in terms of hospitality and depth of flavor, this place has nailed it. Needless to say, this is my mom's new favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING! I have been to the Providence location many times and always had terrific service and food. The Quail Hollow location is obviously mismanaged as we had terrible service and mediocre food. Everything was off. Table was not ready when we came in at our reservation time. Table had no place settings. Asked for water along with our drinks and water never came. Server could not open wine and broke the cork at our table. Appetizer came to our table and we had no plates or silverware. Dinner came and I asked for pepper, server could not find any pepper mills. I had to ask another table to get some. When it was time to get the check, they couldn't get that right either. Our server disappeared and I had to find the manager to get our credit cards run. It was one thing after another. We laughed it off, but we will never be back to this location. NEVER."}
{"text":"Having been to their original location, I was thrilled when they opened at Quail Corners, closer to where I live!  Finally went there last night with some friends.  I must admit we were all underwhelmed which was very disappointing based on the rave reviews from friends!  First, they didn't have the chardonnay we ordered.  Our waitress then suggested another one which was $12 more.  We told her if they would sell it for the price of the wine we ordered, then sure, we'd take it.  Needless to say, that's not the one we ordered.  The sommelier did come over with a taste of 2 different ones which we appreciated!

I was excited to try the burrata appetizer as its description sounded delicious.  Once it arrived, we all were like \"hmm, it's a caprese salad\". Definitely not what we expected!  That should be listed in the salad section.

All of our entrees were mediocre at best.  I absolutely love scallops and was anxious to try.  Instead of the large, rich, sweet, succulent scallops most restaurants offer for a $24 entr√©e, these were the small ones.  Again, it was just mediocre.

My friends had a pine nut tart which was described to us by our waiter as \"like pecan pie\".  I did not taste it but my friends were not impressed and told the waiter so.  At least the manager agreed to take it off our bill.

Service was mediocre as well.  We had a tag team of a waitress and waiter which became annoying b/c she had already taken our drink order and then he came over to ask if we had made any decisions on wine.  If they are going to tag team, they need to communicate!  Both were very nice but we had to ask a couple of times for water refills and we had to take our bill/credit card to the front where our waitress was just gabbing with the manager.  Not attentive service, but she was very sweet.

I won't be anxious to go back anytime soon!  But if friends choose this restaurant, I will try it again."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Ilios Noche for quite some time and decided to take the plunge tonight. 

I was surprised at the strip-mall location, and by the deafening cacophony of chatter of a large number of people packed into a small area. This is not a huge restaurant, but obviously quite popular.

A more pleasant surprise was having my 8:45pm reservation honored immediately. We were walked and, due to the crowded table-space, occasionally sidled, to our table without delay. 

Getting to our table was a bit like working out a maze. Only this time throw in factors for your own dexterity, flexibility, and girth. 

The wine selection appeared to be quite large, and the beer selection quite small. Nothing on tap. Only cans and bottles. 

Our first course was a cheese assortment: feta and olives, manouri and figs, gorgonzola and walnuts, and fresh mozzarella with confit tomato served with what I believe were triangles of wheat pita. The mozzarella was the least flavorful but the tomato and a balsamic  drizzle countered that. The other cheeses were all simply stellar on their own and their own pairings of figs, walnuts, and olives did nothing but improve them. A fantastic start.

My second course was imported Italian Agostino Recca white anchovies with celery. The anchovies were, unsurprisingly, anchovies, though without the overpowering saltiness of the kind I have usually had out of a tin or on pizza. There was also a delicious, almost vinegary, flavor present, and the celery added just the right amount of crunchy texture. 

My wife ordered the Mageiritsa Soup; consisting of braised lamb, egg-lemon broth, spring greens, dill, scallions and e.v.o.o. I had a good portion of this soup, myself. The lamb was a bit over-cooked, but the soup itself had a distinct, tart, lemon flavor that left me craving the next spoonful as soon as I'd downed the last. 

The main course for me was Striped bass served with lemon, e.v.o.o., and capers with a side of asparagus grilled with black pepper and e.v.o.o.  The bass was grilled whole, then fileted before serving. I was assured by our server that this dish melted in the mouth and she was absolutely correct. As a small, pun intended, bonus; the capers were apparently grilled as well, which was a treat compared to the usual fresh-out-of-the-bottle approach. The asparagus was also fantastic, but you can't really go wrong with grilling asparagus. 

The main course for my companion was Lamb chops, which were served with \"Greek fries\" and tzatziki. Greek fries being not much more than very thick cut potato chips, but however they cooked and seasoned them - they were perfect. Again, the lamb was a bit over-cooked but the tzatziki sauce was the best I'd ever tasted. 

She also ordered a side of Baby Potatoes, roasted with caramelized onions, e.v.o.o. and herbs. Another fantastic side dish- the onions added such a sweet flavor you wouldn't have known they were onions if you hadn't read it on the menu. 

My wife opted for a gluten free chocolate tort with cinnamon ice-cream. \"gluten free chocolate tort\" being a fancy way of saying \"not quite as thick and rich as fudge but awfully close\". It was, admittedly, extremely good fudge and paired perfectly with the cinnamon ice-cream, which was stellar. 

Things, unfortunately, did fall apart a bit on the dessert side for me. I love tiramisu, and I was sure it would be fantastic. I also like Turkish coffee, and they had Greek coffee, which is the same thing. 

Unfortunately, the coffee hadn't been prepared properly and was extremely weak and watery. As for the tiramisu, it was fairly bland, and worse, just on the wrong side of completely thawed, as if it had been frozen, or at the very least kept much too cold. I don't really care for ice-crystals in my tiramisu. I ate it anyway, but we did note that someone at another table sent their tiramisu order back. 

I'm still going to give the place four stars, based on the strong start of the meal alone. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ventured to Ilios Noche this past Friday night to try it out for the first time. We live about 5 minutes from this location and had been wanting to try it for quite some time. And I'm glad we did!

We did not have a reservation but chose to wait at the bar until a table opened up. We were served promptly at the bar: I ordered the Fresca Fresca cocktail (good but a little too sweet for me) and my fiance ordered the Smokey in the Rye which was a neat concept and absolutely delicious. Within only 20 minutes or so, a table opened up and we took our drinks with us. 

Our waitress (I can't remember her name but she was great!) greeted us almost immediately after we sat down. She brought a complimentary dip with pita to the table (tzaziki) and it was delicious. Definitely a nice little appetizer. My fiance ordered the moussaka and I ordered the mushroom risotto with scallops. My fiance raved about this moussaka and I enjoyed my risotto, particularly the scallops which were cooked to perfection. As others have mentioned, the risotto was a little on the salty side but still very good. I'm not sure I would order it again but that's solely because I want to try more of this wonderful menu! Our waitress was also able to recommend excellent wine pairings for both of our dishes and we capped off the meal with a drunken Irishman coffee (absolutely delicious). 

My fiance and I will definitely be back to this location very soon."}
{"text":"Nice place. I love the grilled octopus. Bryan is really good server. Always looking for him when there Also love the Greek salad with cucumbers and tomatoes. Clean and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"We have visited Ilios Noche on Providence Road several times before so this was our first foray to the one in Quail.  Ambiance is nicer, the waitstaff was prompt and friendly, and the food was okay.  We ordered the eggplant and zucchini chips to begin.  As in the other restaurant they are way too salty.  Just completely ruins them.  We had them re-made with no salt and they were much improved (the batter probably has some salt).  My husband and me both ordered the salmon which comes with big beans underneath.  It tasted a little fishy like it was not quite fresh, and it was a little too salty, but we ate it anyway.  The beans were way too salty for me so I just ate a few. The number one biggest improvement this restaurant could make is to cut the salt; the food would be much tastier, not to mention healthier.  Big View Diner has the same problem.  PLEASE CUT THE SALT but not the flavor.  By the way my husband's rating is 2.  1 for the ambiance and 1 for the waiter.  My husband will not return but if I go again with friends I will make sure to tell them to omit the salt then add my own if there is any need."}
{"text":"Our #2 visit - and there will be many others!  Arrived at 5'ish Sunday evening to have a leisurely experience without a crowd; the placed filled up before we left at 7'ish.

If the owner is reading this - we particularly enjoy dining \"off-hours\"  and your staff made us feel at home, and not rushed.  Your team listened to our request and delivered our desired dining pace.

My Lamb Youresti was perfect: lamb quality / preparation / quantity / presentation.  Others at table enjoyed Moussaka, and Salmon.  Another person ordered Chicken Parm and received an amazingly large portion which he complemented.  All enjoyed the food - and appreciated a leisurely dining experience.

Looking forward to visit #3 when the patio is open!"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend on a date to get some good food and wine and we were both very disappointed in our food. We won't be back. I will say the service was pretty decent but our food was some of the most bland we've ever had! I got the lobster ravioli which was extremely plain it barely tasted like anything at all and just wasn't good. I've honestly had frozen lean cuisine's that tasted better in all seriousness. My GFs food was barely any better than mine but still nothing special by any means. So $45 down the drain and we would've been better off going to the grocery store and picking stouffers or lean cuisines and saved $40. So save yourself the money and go to a better spot!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service!  Drove 40 minutes to visit. Well worth our time."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere.  Stephanie behind the bar likes to have fun with mixology.  The octopus app will turn the octopus reluctant into a believer.  The Salmon was delish and the spinach pie is incomparable.   That means damn good.  The sizzling shrimp app is fantastic and a little spicy but the size of the shrimp is awesome and their falafels are probably the best I've ever had. Wonderfully seasoned crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. And when they have live music is the perfect atmosphere for a little romance."}
{"text":"As other reviews reflect, the food is great, the ambiance is great.  Service is terrible.  We have gone three times now, every time terrible service.  Our last experience similar to our previous, we sat on the patio, it took forever for a server to come to our table.  We waited so long we had to go the hostess to have a server come by.  It wasn't just us; during our visit another couple got up and walked out, pure neglect.  What made it worse was a manager came by, I gave him feedback and it still was bad.  My wife's food came out wrong, etc etc.  Needless to say after three visits we are done, no more."}
{"text":"We went here for my best friends birthday- party of 14.  We were seated at a table that was near the open kitchen.  Lots of room and great ambiance.  Our server was amazing.  He stayed on top of drinks orders and explained the menu in full detail while answering any questions we had.  I ordered the vegetable plate- you can pick three sides.  I chose Risotto(cooked to perfection), red quinoa salad with sliced almond(incredible) and chick pea fries that were very light and tasty.  Awesome time!  Awesome place!
Great for large parties or an intimate date."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious but the service was terrible. It may have just been our waitress but it put a damper on our experience."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the revamped Quail Corners, this is a hidden gem with a deserving reputation.
We went on a Saturday night and got to hear some really (and I mean really) good jazz renditions of some pop songs old and new. It added great ambiance to very classy looking place. I am not sure if this a weekly thing or not but I'd hope so.
But people don't go to a restaurant for the jazz, so on to the food.
They have a really good Mediterrainian menu and I hae never heard a waiter be so enthusiastic about the food. We decided it was either his first job in a restaurant of this caliber or the food was really that good. We hoped for the latter.

He sold us on a hummus plate, the short ribs and the lamb burger. All of it was out of this world. They were packed with flavor and cooked perfectly. The funny part was there were no less than eight other items our waiter was enthusiastic about. I guess we will have to go back.

While I was with a group and not on a date, I think a found a great new date spot. Terrific food and ambiance at a well reasoned price (it is more upscale but you can get out of there for $12-22 a person)."}
{"text":"I had a date on Saturday night with my best girlfriend who I rarely get to see since she lives in Charlotte and I live in Arizona.  We headed to Ilios Noche as she speaks highly of their food and recent renovation... We should have known the place would be packed when we couldn't find a parking space nearby, but we bit the bullet and parked a tad bit further and ran in through the pouring rain.  

We had a short wait, but the hostesses were friendly and we were greeted by Stratos himself (of Stratos Restaurant Group who also has Big View Diner and Nolen Kitchen in his portfolio of restaurants).  We entertained ourselves by catching up, people-watching, and then finally, looking at the menu as we prepared for our order.  (The menu is huge by the way, so it was hard for us to narrow down what we wanted... everything sounded amazing from the appetizers , soups, salads, and sandwiches to the entrees , pizzas, pastas, and sides).

We were seated at a table in the back after waiting just over 30 minutes or so... and we immediately ordered drinks and a \"Traditional Greek Spreads\" tasting plate, \"Pikilia.\"  It came out pretty fast (along with whole wheat pita) and we dove right in... I highly recommend all of the spreads, but the Roasted Red Pepper spread was our fave!

For our meals, I went with the Greek Country Salad and added lamb and Sloan went for the Capellini & Diver Scallops.  We shared two sides as well: Charred Asparagus and Greek \"Fries.\"  Everything was delicious although I will warn you that if you order the Greek Country Salad, be prepared for lots of red onion!

Service was pretty spot on.  Our waiter checked in with us often and refilled our drinks before they got too low.  He also replaced the cocktail napkins several times - gotta love that attention!  There was also a fun, happening vibe in the restaurant yet it wasn't too loud to have an intimate conversation either...

If I lived in Charlotte, I'd definitely make Ilios Noche a regular in my lunch/dinner rotation, and I can't wait to try Big View Diner and Nolen Kitchen on future visits as well."}
{"text":"We had not been in a while and Greek friends of ours asked us to join them. It was very loud and we all noticed that portion sizes have been reduced. Their normal wine pour was also short. We tried 6 or 7 appetizers that were good but again, small. The 2 lamb skewers were tougher than normal. We felt service was slow and it was too much for too little."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on a Tuesday night.  Arrived about 6:30 pm, wasn't busy at all, but they tried seating us at tiny table.  We asked for a larger table.  When our server came to our table, he made a comment about this being the most asked for booth...which we ignored.  Bottom line...the food was great, but our service was terrible.  We were completely ignored after our food was ordered.  I think they cater to the regulars, although having only been open such a short period, how do they know who \"the regulars\" are???  We will probably try again because the food was good, and hope for better service."}
{"text":"What a pleasant little gem inside a strip mall in Charlotte North Carolina.  The outside one would be hard-pressed to perceive the hip, spacious, and dining environment that exists behind the walls of this building.

We came in for a late lunch weekday and the restaurant was wide open with no wait. Were quickly seated and have a cocktail and appetizer orders taken almost immediately. For an appetizer we enjoyed the mediterranean spread sampler. This item featured tzatziki, baba ganoush, roasted red pepper, and hummus dips. The flavors present in these dips were authentic, fresh, and very satisfying. The dips were accompanied by warm pita slices that provided a perfect accompaniment. 

For meals we enjoyed the combination of two different Mediterranean salads and a pita wrap. All of the food was fresh, promptly served, and everyone was pleased with the outcome. Additionally we were all surprised by the quality of the Greek potatoes that accompanied the pita sandwich. 

Overall, we had a great experience. The service was attentive. The restaurant was clean and have an upscale vibe without being pretentious. We would definitely go back in the future when we are in town."}
{"text":"By far one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. The service and food is impeccable..Make it your business to go to ilios...I was there on a Friday night and they had live music...it sounded so good..a great compliment to the environment, very sexy and chic!"}
{"text":"I have to start this review by stating that the food at Ilios Noche is very good.  But our meal this evening was somewhat disappointing.  Perhaps we should have known that many restaurants like this one use prix fixe menus in holidays like Mother's Day.  But a prepared menu with no vegetarian options?  Somewhat disappointing.  And I also believe that this is the sort of thing you should note very clearly on your website to ensure that customers are not surprised (which they did not).

Secondly, service was decidedly subpar.  Whole we saw plenty of the other wait staff, our waiter was conspicuously absent for most of the meal, and when he did appear, was not especially responsive.  Both coffee and tea required two asks and over 15 minutes to deliver.  And the family that was seated after us editors the restaurant well before us... and not because we are not slow eaters!  Total meal time was almost 90 minutes, which for our family is unusual.

But the food?  Tremendous.  I had the salmon filet over delectable white beans, while other had lobster ravioli, veggie primavera and mozzarella flatbread.  The kale salad was absolutely delicious, as was everything else we tried.  Dessert was the best part of the meal - amazing cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake - both were truly excellent.

Overall, I'm hoping this was a holiday fluke, and that our next visit will be an improvement!"}
{"text":"Try the melon salad and one of the fresh cocktails.. Perfect Friday night after a long work week. Food is delicious and organic"}
{"text":"I've been here just once for lunch because a website rated it as one of the top 10 Charlotte restaurants. It doesn't stand out from the street, because it is in a strip mall next to Harris Teeter. 

I went there because I was craving hummus and hoped to have some here, which I did for a starter! It came with pita bread, and it was pretty good. My spicy seafood pasta did not meet my expectations however, because it wasn't spicy one bit. The pasta was still tasty and filing though. 

The server looked like he was just waiting to leave. Didn't feel welcomed by his service at all. 

Would I go there again? Probably not unless I had a specific reason I had to go there."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar before sitting for dinner.  Thought bar service from Erica was stellar.  When sat at table, Philly was the server.  Group of 8 for dinner.  Philly did a good job.  Very attentive.  Appetizers were very good.  Appetizers ra used the review from a 2 to a 3.  Entrees were disappointing, very disappointing.  Temps were incorrect, no flavors on meat, vegetables. Ordered Lamb and took one bite and stopped.  Drinks were very good!!  Not sure what the deal was last night from reading other reviews but I would not go back for dinner.  I would go back and sit at bar for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Ilios Noche is a Greek / Mediterranean restaurant located in Charlotte, NC and is part of the Xenia Hospitality Group (where it is all about \"hospitality\" or \"generosity\").  The focus for Ilios Noche is on a fast & casual restaurant, bar, and bakery dining experience.  

I tried the following:

1) \"Greek Style\" Pork Ribs (with coriander, lemon, olive-cabbage slaw, cucumber yogurt) - my manager (from work) ordered this and I got to try some.  Lucky me!  This is definitely a MUST GET item!  The meat was fall off the bones with the perfect amount of seasoning!

2) Braised Short Ribs - I ordered this for dinner as this was marketed as the \"Sunday Daily Special\".  Loved the flavors, but I thought the meat was a tad dry in the center of the meat.  Good size portion.

ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"This place offers a menu to satisfy anyone's palette. Have enjoyed lunch and dinner here. If you should find yourself here and the lamb is a special... Highly recommend it. It melted in my mouth and no knife needed... The Lobster ravioli delicious... The red pepper hummus worth the trip alone... If you're lucky enough to sit in Dave's section... You will be treated right and served with his knowledge of the food with some humor thrown in..."}
{"text":"We went to here for the first time with another couple who had dined at the other location. I was excited as I love Mediterranean food. The atmosphere is great, the menu fantastic, but that's it. Our server took almost 20 minutes to get our friends' and my husband's cocktails. Mine took another 15 minutes on top of that, and by then, we were almost done with our appetizer (we had the four Mediterranean spreads and they were very good). Our food came out and while the orzo was delicious, after a couple bites, I bit down to find a hard, sharp piece of plastic in my food. We alerted our server (who didn't seem too concerned) and who started to tell me it was probably a piece of plastic wrap from the lamb, until I showed him it was actually hard plastic with a pointy, sharp edge. He asked me if I wanted it re-done, which I did and the manager came over. He apologized and brought me a glass of wine on the house. My re-done meal came out and while the orzo was fantastic, I was disappointed in my lamb shank. It was very fatty and didn't have a ton of flavor. I tried my husband's moussaka, which was great, and my friend's lamb chops were like my lamb, not a strong flavor and kind of bland. Our arugula salad was good, as was the side order of Greek white beans. Come to end of the meal and my friends were charged for an extra cocktail and they didn't take my meal off the bill like the manager had suggested they would. I was very disappointed and we will NOT be returning"}
{"text":"Nice little spot in the shopping center with fine dining. The drinks weren't that great though but the food was fantastic as well as the service!"}
{"text":"Had my first experience here the other night.  First off, very nice bar area and very large dining area.  Overall very nice decor.  I had the braised lamb which was fantastic.  service was spot on.  will def go back"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!
My husband and I moved from Dallas,Texas 20 months ago. Fall of 2011, we stumbled on this unbelievable restaurant. My husband is a chef graduate of The Culinary Institute of America, so...
We.Know.Food. 

The new redesign is a wonderful delight. Beautiful design, more spacious and the sound level for conversation is much better than the first styling.
From the moment we walk in the reception is always welcoming. The bar area is striking and the bar staff is knowledgable, fun and great at wine selections.
Then there's the food! These chef owners know how to put a menu together!
P E R F E C T I O N! 

The Greek and Italian recipes are delicious, interesting, fresh and always leave us wanting to try something new. To single out one dishing impossible... All are tremendous! The chef ownersnand partners do it RIGHT! Servers are knowledgable about the menu, are attentive & professional.

We are becoming regulars and feel this is THE place to enjoy weekdays and weekend dining! Drinks and apps at the bar for a happy hour or late evening is the thing to do as well.
We really love this special find!

{"text":"Ilios Noche has a great menu! I start with the Musclun Salad, which has candied walnuts and blue cheese. Their falafel is out of this world. I always think about getting a second order. I also like to have the broccolini. 

I enjoy sitting outside and listening to the music. Ilios Noche is my 'go to' restaurant for a healthy, relaxing meal!"}
{"text":"Ilios Noche was a fantastic experience. Booked reservations based on all the positive reviews, and we were not disappointed. We ordered the spread sampler to start off which was delicious. Three separate times we were asked by three different individuals if we wanted more pitas, which was very nice. I ordered the chicken lemonada (sp) and it was fantastic. Like nothing I have ever tasted before! Definitely would recommend. Hubby got the pork rib which was so tender it fell off the bone. The flavor was great a well. Great decorated venue and attentive staff makes this the place to go to in Charlotte. Looking forward to when it gets warm again to use their outdoor patio which looks romantic and comfy. Bottom line, this city is in desperate need of more places like this."}
{"text":"Lovely date night dinner. Sarah did a great job of service and recommendations for wine and dessert.  We had a few tasty apps as tapas with a bottle of wine, and especially enjoyed the coconut cake on the recommendation of our server. The restaurant was a little loud, but  overall we enjoyed and hope to be back on our next childless evening."}
{"text":"Have eaten here at least 4-5 times. Very good food. Have never eaten anything that didn't taste good here. Really like their Pikilia (sampler spreads). They have this Eggplant appetizer with walnuts, red onions and mint - super yum if you go in for that sort of thing. The chicken pita is a good staple , as well as the lamb burger. I always order a greek beer to go with it. They have at least two kinds in bottle. I always like to drink the beer that matches the cuisine, even though I'm pretty sure Greeks are not big beer drinkers."}
{"text":"I have bookmarked Ilios Noches for some time and why I waited so long to come is beyond me. The location is way off the beaten path for most people especially when most of my dining takes around 77 interstate line. It was well worth the discovery process. I have been to some of their other sister locations and I have always been pleased. 

Esthetics: 
Those who don't initially judge by location, d√©cor and layout, are not true diners (my opinion). I certainly don't mind a good hole in the wall but my passion for design and a well laid out restaurant is always in the back of my mind. The location is small and it's in a strip mall, don't judge. You walk in and its very tasteful with an open kitchen design behind the bar. It's modern, casual appeal is there and it makes it comfortable. It's not super fancy by any means but it's a nice spot. I am very curious about their newer location closer to Southpark because their outdoor seating is supposed to be a lot nicer, and more of a lounge. 

Service: 
The moment you walk in you are greeted by very friendly hostesses. You don't get the \"I am too good to be a hostess\" feel you get way too often when you are in Southpark or Uptown. I sat at the bar because my intention was not to have a full on dinner (which is what ended up happening). My service attendant at the bar was very knowledgeable in the wines offered and did it with a smile. Truly was a pleasure to have had nice service given that I was sitting at the bar. Sometimes you get missed by an overwhelmed bar tenders providing service to both those sitting in the main dining and the bar but that wasn't a feeling nor the experience I had. 

Last but not least....FOOD: 
Greek food is one of my favorite cuisines. Greek food is light, fresh and on the healthier side than most ethnic cuisine. However so is Italian which is what they also claim to be. I give my opinion on food but ethnic food in particular on a \"main dish\" that the restaurant should be known well for given the country/region. Greek chicken and lemon potatoes is a staple. How do I grade them? Sadly, I give them a B- and not because it wasn't tasty but because it honestly didn't taste authentic. The chicken was tender and juicy, that was for sure but it lacked the signature  fresh spices, primarily oregano and lemon... really???. The potatoes didn't even have that fresh lemon taste. I wouldn't order it again but only because I am still curious enough to try other things on the menu. My friend had the crazy lasagna, it was tasty and it come with a very nice herb bread. 

I will say that their trio of humus was phenomenal! Talk about flavor and freshness. It composed of Roasted eggplant aka Melitzanosalata, Roasted red pepper aka Htipiti and your traditional chickpea humus aka Revithiasalata, all of which was nicely presented with yummy triangles of pita bread.

All this said I would suggest this to people to try out. They have a great contemporary wine list and half priced bottles on Tuesdays.  I want to give them another go but like I mentioned earlier, I want to try out the other location to compare. 

Kali oreksi.....translation, Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"When you first walk in the place is dimly lit very relaxing and welcoming.   We got seated right away although the place was almost full there was space available. Only complaint I have is half the drink cocktails were not available. I was denied my first two choices and told they were 'seasonal drinks'. Everything we ordered from the appetizers to the main entree was cooked to perfection. Food was a little pricey but definitely worth it.  Want to have a great date night go here."}
{"text":"Ilios Noche is a Mediterranean and Italian restaurant. My family took us here for dinner one night when we visited and it did not disappoint. Located in Charlotte, NC in a shopping center the decor of this place was amazing! The shiplap walls created a cozy ambiance with a classy twist. When we arrived, a local artist performed cover songs on the acoustic guitar by the bar. I'm not sure if they have live music often but it was a treat to jam out to 90's rock. 

For appetizers we ordered grilled octopus and angry shrimp. Both were delicious but I enjoyed the grilled octopus more! It had the smoky taste but also very flavorful. They give you a basket of bread and it comes out fresh! For my entree I ordered the lobster ravioli and the pasta and sauce were made to perfection. The lobster meat was the perfect amount! My sister ordered the crazy lasagna and the amount of cheese was crazy alright! It's one of their popular dishes that came out in a skillet but sadly I was too full to take a bite.   

By the end of it all, we were all too full to eat the desserts so I didn't get a chance to glance at the menu and try any. Our server Nadia was so attentive and pleasant! My sister and brother in-law always request her and I completely understand why. I highly recommend this place if you're ever stuck craving both types of food."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaaaaaas. After an absolutely wretched experience at its sister restaurant, Nolen Kitchen, some friends and I decided to try Ilios Noche instead. The server was SUPER on top of things, bring us our drinks right at noon (hello, Sunday liquor laws in NC), and the eggplant app was amaaaaaazing. My Greek salad was not incredible, but all in all, the service, decor, and starter were really great."}
{"text":"Tuesday Night- Half price bottles of wine.  But don't go there if you are not drinking wine. 

My daughter (21) and I went tonight for dinner. We were not in the mood for wine. I ordered water, she a Diet Coke. Our waitress was pleasant but not attentive at all to our table. The other tables around us had finished, and were just chatting. I think she may have been ready to go herself.

The food here is always good. Everything I have ever tried has been delicious. But unfortunately I will not be returning. I rather take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I remember two things from our last visit here.

The zucchini chips were addictive and I couldn't stop eating them. Salty and crunchy and so satisfying, I have not had them anywhere that met my newfound expectations for what they should taste like.

The service was very bad.  We did not see our waitress until 30 minutes after our entree was dropped off. Someone else boxed up our leftovers and we were still waiting for the check. It turned a nice dinner into an aggravation unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great food, even better service. My wife and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Back to Ilios....only to be just as happy as the last time I was there...They do EVERYTHING right....So Good..Zucchini and Eggplant Fritters, Perfect, Fig and Prosciutto Flatbread, Perfect, And the Calamari is the Best in Charlotte!...Today was just a quick lunch but their Cocktails are outstanding too.   If you haven't been in a while...GO! I am telling you!!"}
{"text":"No matter when I go this place always proves to be on spot. I was upset because they didn't have the flounder on the menu so I opted for the Greek ribs. Unbelievable, these fell of the bone and the flavor was fantastic. They ran out of Woodfords so I had to get Makers instead was the only thing that was sub par. 
You won't go bad here on any dish. Wait staff was great as usual."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've pretty much have had everything  Molto delizioso. 
Pax our waiter was delightful.
Highly recommend going here"}
{"text":"Loved the service and food here. We got seated quickly and were immediately greeted by our waitress. She was very knowledgeable and helped recommend our entire dinner! She helped us pick menu items based on foods we liked and even helped pick out a specialty drink. 

The food was incredible and came out quickly. It was not a huge portion of food and the food was delicious and very different than I would have normally ordered. 

I enjoyed the ambiance in the restaurant as well. It is a good mid-priced place to get a romantic dinner or lounge at the bar with friends."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I eat here for lunch often and it is always packed. I also drop in for take out occasionaly as well. I have never had a bad meal here. I have never had a bad meal here. The chicken is always cooked perfectly, the most moist juicy chicken EVER. I love it on the Grapes and Fennel salad. The only reoccuring problem I have had is that the service is usually slow. It starts okay and by the end of the meal you are flagging someone, anyone, down to pay your bill."}
{"text":"Had a fun time with a great server. The appetizers are the way to go here. Great calamari, lightly breaded, olives & nuts and a lovely spread on toast points. Entrees were very disappointing. Lamb shank (tiny) on inedible, over spiced risotto type rice, ravioli blah & scallops over linguine that was very dry."}
{"text":"I realized that I write Yelp reviews either when a business establisment makes me angry or \"wows me \" with superb product or service. Not when I receive consistently good product or service..so today I decided change that: Ilios offer excellent food, friendly service. Always! My wife and I have eaten there about 10-15 times and have never been disappointed. Food is excellent every time. Service is great,  one can tell servers like working there...Manager/owner is always around and makes sure the food and the service quality is consistently good. Great job Ilios team, never change your formula!!"}
{"text":"I would give ilios 5 stars if it were only based on the food although I had been before and had a different experience. I went last week for a birthday dinner and we had a server who was not the best. Mind you, 5 of the 8 people have been in the service industry so we're pretty lenient with our judgment of service because 'we know how it is'. He didn't show very much personality and took long to get us drinks, desserts, and checks. He definitely could have been nicer and more attentive."}
{"text":"I was on my own, tired, wanted a light dinner. I was near Ilios Noche so I stopped in. I sat at the bar and had a nice Zinfandel while I enjoyed reading the menu. So many options - but I chose simple: lamb souvlaki with tzatziki and pita, and a plate of roasted asparagus. So good, perfect. The bar server was pleasant and attentive. I will return often."}
{"text":"Went in Jan 2015 for dinner.  We had calamari which was excellent (fresh, light breading and MARINARA which is increasingly difficult to get with calamari in Charlotte), the goat cheese in marinara with focaccia was THE BEST appetizer with bread/crackers/focaccia I've ever had (truly amazing goat cheese), and the lamb chops with sliced & fried potatoes were out of this world. Pure heaven. 

We also got a free order of fried cheese for my buddy looking like Luke Kuechly and it was excellent as well.

The decor and layout leave a little to be desired IMO, as it seems better suited for the lunch and bar crowd. 

Would have gotten 5 stars but the menu is very pricey. $25-$30 for most dinner entrees is \"$$$\" in my checkbook. 

With all of the other options in Charlotte for dinner it will probably be some time before I return, but still deserving of four stars."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We had the lamb and pizza, and they both were amazing. Waiter was helpful and very knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food!! Aaron the manager was very helpful. Our order happen to take longer than they expect (I felt the time was fine), so they took care of our app. And desserts. Way over the top service. They also made a specialty drink for me that I explained and they made."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself has great ambiance.  If I could rate our server separately I would give her 5 stars for taking on a table of 8 with such efficiency and attention to detail.  But bottom line, it's about the food.  I went for lunch with my neighborhood friends.  Ordered the Mediterranean Cobb salad with no special edits.  Keep in mind this salad is $13.50.  Portion, small.  Lettuce?  Cheapest on the planet...iceberg.  Tomatoes?  One cherry tomato cut in half.  Seriously?  ONE?  Grilled shrimp was the best part.  Missing?  Olives and prosciutto.  I'm telling the neighborhood ladies to pick a different place next time.  To be fair, I have been here for dinner 3 times as well.  First one was great, second two were a waste of considerable money.  I'm done with Ilios Noche."}
{"text":"Great service, great lamb, great food. The managers and wait staff are very attentive and helpful..happy to make recommendations.  The lamb dishes, spinach pie, roasted pepper dip and wonderful.  The cocktails are unique and good.  Ok, so we tried the dessert sampler and even the tiramisu .....yum.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. No complaints on the menu. Please, please turn the air conditioner on...its summer in the south. We need to dine comfortably and without sweating."}
{"text":"I enjoyed all meals except the salmon. The salmon was overcooked and was heavily flavored with onion seasoning. Fresh fish should not be over seasoned, especially  not with onions :(

The staff is great!!! The atmosphere is great!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy times ten. Great meal, great service!

I booked on Open Table and arrived to find that the place was barely a quarter filled. Nice. We were immediately seated at a table towards the back, near the very filled wine racks. Sadly, my wife and I aren't wine drinkers but if you are then you'll be pleased. I chose a Catawba draft instead.

The taste of four starter is the way to begin here. Scoops of hummus, tzatziki sauce, red pepper and eggplant with a nice serving of slices whole wheat pitas. Probably too much for two to start with because there was a lot there and we were \"uh, what?\" when our main courses arrived.

My wife chose the lobster ravioli. A very large portion with plenty to bring home, especially after we filled up on the starter. Tasty, creamy, seafoody (is \"seafoody\" a word?) and easy to eat. Delish.

I had the quarter chicken which was served with potatoes and other veggies. A very big portion, there was a lot of flavor and texture in here, with the perfectly al dente potatoes.

Dessert? Well, I guess we can try. We split a piece of baclava which came topped with some sort of (lightly peach-flavored) ice cream/yogurt. Delish.

STUFFED with a delicious meal. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't ever go down to Ballantyne for dinner, but went to Ilios Noche for a bridal shower and had the BEST experience.  The service was amazing: waiter was extremely attentive and efficient but not annoyingly in your face.  The food was so delicious!  I had the mesclun salad (delish!) and the salmon with giant white beans.  I feel comfortable saying it was the best salmon I've ever had, and I order salmon often.  It was divine!  I had the balsamic glazed berries with basil ice cream for dessert, which some people at the table disliked for being too \"strange\" but I loved it.  It was light and refreshing.  You should definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"We had a TERRIBLE mix-up with the too young hostesses in charge of seating (Immediately forgotten after checking in, then told we had never claimed our 7:00 pm reservation).  But Ilios Noche made everything right!

We appreciated the sincere apology from the Manager and received top-notch service from our waiter Juan.  The Valentine's menu choices were absolutely delicious (I had the short rib stuffed ravioli appetizer with baby lima beans and Parmesan, my husband devoured the whole lobster with Greek seasonings) as well as the tried and true standards (grilled octopus and sea scallops on cauliflower mash with artichokes and dried cherries). 

There are so many yummy items that appeal to diners of all ages, you simply must go back again and again to try them all!  I absolutely love their traditional Mediterrean favors with a fun, urban twist!"}
{"text":"We came here the other night for dinner and boy was I impressed by this place. Start to finish this place is 5 STARS..!!! The entire experience was absolutely PHENOMENAL..!! 

By the time I arrived my buddy Paul had a dip platter waiting - hummus, tsatziki, eggplant & roasted pepper. It came with a bunch of pita bread -- All 4 were delicious.

I then ordered the pork belly sandwich.... I repeat, PORK BELLY sandwich...!!!! As many of you know, the belly is the pigs greatest culinary gift. It came served on pita bread and came with red onion, tomato, lettuce & tsatziki. I can't even put to words how delicious this sandwich was. It was just AMAZING...!!

Allyson had the moussaka. It was enough for Paul and I to sample and she had plenty left to take home. I've had moussaka at Greek restaurants all over the country and this is one of the BEST I've ever had. 

We ate outside on the patio and as the night went on, it got a little chilly. Our server came over and as soon as we mentioned it was getting cold he turned on two heat lamps for us right away -- He was extremely attentive. In fact, the service provided by the entire staff there was beyond anything I could have possible expected or asked for. 

I can't wait to go back...I'm sure that the only problem for me will be deciding on what to order.

This place is truly a hidden gem in the far corner of a strip mall. I HIGHLY recommend ilios noche quail co..!! Don't underestimate it.. Give this place a try next time you are in the area!"}
{"text":"It's hard to give a place five stars after one meal. This is one of those places. I can't wait to go back and try other menu items. Highlights: Food was the star of the night. Service and ambience a close second. 

Waiting to head to the Charlotte Film Festival on a cold and rainy night, I stumbled upon this place on Yelp & decided to give it a go. I was quickly seated on a Friday night at 8p. The menu overwhelms the mind a bit, as it has many traditional Mediterranean centerpieces, a good amount of seafood choices, and a handful of other entrees and sides (such as pizza and lasagna).

I began with the falafel appetizer, and it did not disappoint. 4 perfectly fried balls of goodness, swimming in a shallow pool of some of the best tzatziki sauce I've ingested. I lived in the LA area for 10 years, and this was one of the top 3 falafels I've ever experienced.

As for the entree, I asked my waiter, Daniel, his recommendation, and without hesitation, he suggested the Lamb 'Youvetsi Me Manestra'. It is described as \"slow braised lamb shank, tomato shallot orzo, mizithra cheese.\" Wow. Just, wow. It was very close to a perfect dish. The lamb was tender and fell apart as the mizithra cheese slowly melted into each bite, adding another layer of flavor. Spices were mixed in well, and the perfectly cooked orzo complimented each bite . It was a good sized portion, but I had to finish it. It was one of those meals you didn't want to end.

Do yourself a favor and give Ilios Noche a try. Date night, anniversary, or just after a long week of work, this is the kind of restaurant that deserves to be celebrated."}
{"text":"Zucchini and Eggplant app is amazing and the spinach pie is awesome. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything here is top tier and the food is great. From the appetizers, the drinks and food are all awesome. Well defiantly be back."}
{"text":"It's in a strip mall set up near Harris Teeter so I didn't expect much the first time I went, but it was very good! 
The Greek spreads are all great, the hand-rolled pasta is delicious-3 of the 4 of us had the Garganelli & Chicken and loved it. Although other things look very good, I am very likely to have that every time I go.  Chocolate Torte was a great finish and they have a good wine and drink selection.
Indoor seating is a moderate noise level and tables are close together, outside is quieter and actually quite nice even though it overlooks the parking lot."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Amazing food, good drinks, fun atmosphere, and amazing music several nights a week!
The crazy lasagna, scallops, or short ribs are my favorites, but truly, you can't go wrong with any choice you make...unless you choose another place to dine."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the second time. The first time being rather uneventful, decided to give it another chance because of friends highly recommended it. The first time was disappointing food and service wise. We had tried the vegetarian livornese pasta. The vegetables were over cooked, and the pasta itself was a soggy mess. Also had a Piemonte pizza, nothing special there. Service was slow, on what looked to be a not very busy night. Or server just seemed to disappear for long stretches. The second time here was much better. Our server was very attentive. The food was good too. The taste of spreads appetizers was delicious. I had lamb burger, which was perfectly cooked. My wife had a chief created vegetarian pasta of the menu. This time vegetables cooked and seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  Dessert and drinks were okay."}
{"text":"I have dined here twice and  have not been  all that impressed with it. The last time was this past week. They have a new fall menu so I decided to try it again.  I have to give it mixed reviews. We got the appetizer portion of the Greek Style pork ribs with the slaw and cucumber yogurt, which was very good. My friend got a steak that he said was well prepared but disputed whether it was a NY strip as listed, thought it was more like a sirloin steak. I got the butternut risotto which was bland. Typically this dish is prepared by cooking in pureed butternut squash with the Arborio rice which imparts a squash flavor and an orange tint to the dish. Their dish was a basic risotto with cubes of cooked butternut squash stirred in, it would seem after the risotto was cooked, not during. It was white in a appearance with a few lumps of squash. They topped it with some herbs and prosciutto, but overall the dish lacked flavor. Definitely not what I expected. 

Service seems to be an issue here. The first time we sat in the bar area and felt that our server was inattentive. This time we were in the main dining area. The server did not seem to have a good command of the new menu; he was not able to give detailed info on some of the dishes we asked about. A  restaurant should make sure all servers have a good knowledge of the menu. And if they don't know a specific question, they should ask the kitchen/management for more info."}
{"text":"The food took forever to be served! We had spicy calamari  for appetizer which is not spicy at all but nonetheless tasted good. The steak was awesome! The spaghetti was good but i didn't like the meatballs they tasted like paper. The chardonnay tasted like nothing, I mean nothing at all. It looked like it was diluted with water. The sweet tea was great. If the weather is nice, prefer eating outside. Inside has bad acoustic. It sounded worse than a sports bar."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for 7-8 years and always come back because the food is consistently very good, as is the service.  Servers and management are very friendly. And very professional.  I have a few favorite items but find the regular fish specials to be very good.  I have always liked the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"After hearing much about this restaurant, I tried it on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  It was good but not great.  

I ordered the scallops and a side of white beans.  The scallops were okay, but nothing special...your basic pan sear.  In my opinion, they werent very flavorful.  The white beans were an awesome side.  Very flavorful, they made up for the blandness of the scallops.

Ambience - 5/5 very nice setting, beautiful stained wood furniture in a low light setting, with tons of space

Service - 4/5, extremely nice staff and fast service

Food - 3/5, i wasnt impressed and dont feel an urgent need to return anytime soon

Price - $$, typical middle of the road dining experience"}
{"text":"We celebrated Mother's Day at the Quail Corners location. We ate at the Providence Rd. location a few months prior. Both spots are similar -- I think I like the Providence Rd. one a little better but Quail Corners is closer. Oh, the dilemma! #firstworldproblems

The restaurant was full but handling the crowd well. Service was spot on -- thank you Kyle! I love a restaurant that is attentive but not overbearing. I felt well taken care of but our conversations were never interrupted, we had time to linger over dishes, etc. We also appreciate they use OpenTable for reservations. 

Because we had some first timers in the group, our server offered up a few complimentary spreads/dips. We went with the red pepper and eggplant. Both were good; I loved the eggplant. We also ordered olives & almonds and arranchini to start. I had a couple cocktails -- the city of zin and dessert rose. Both were great! Others in the group ordered beers. The beer selection was solid with a wide variety of local drafts and bottles/cans from all over. 

I had the side plate for my \"main.\" You can choose 3 sides for $15 -- I went with the risotto, mushrooms and asparagus. All were delicious! The mushrooms were kinda cold but it didn't stop me from stirring them into my risotto for quite the tasty treat. Others in my group ordered panini, spaghetti & meatballs, and chicken parm. Everything looked and smelled SO good. 

Overall, great spot serving tasty, fresh Mediterranean flavors in a strip mall. Look past the Harris Teeter next door -- once inside, you'll forget you're not at a stand-alone restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was good. HORRIBLE service on a Saturday night. We had reservations, and still waited 1 hour until we sat down.  In fact, we ended up grabbing a seat in the bar area at the 1 hour mark--we never even got seated at our reserved table! We saw the manager seat another couple of two before us, even though they checked in after us (which I know because this same couple tried to cut us while waiting in line to check in). After we seated ourselves in the bar area, the manager did come over, quickly slung down an appetizer while mumbling \"sorry for the wait\", and  then quickly ran off without even making eye contact with us. No reasoning as to why they kept us waiting for an hour, or why he sat another couple before us. That's not how you treat customers. I will never go back, nor will I recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Great for those evening cocktails on the patio. Easily the best lamb burger in charlotte and the hummus and other dips are just amazing. The staff is awesome and knowledgeable about the food which is great if your new to Mediterranean food. This place happens to be close to my house and is always on our short-list of restaurants for dinner. This is the type of place you can go to and you will be in love with the first thing you try (the lamb burger for me) and you will not want to order a different item the second time which a true dilemma because the other items I promise you are delicious as well."}
{"text":"This is our new goto, Friday night, hard day at work, need a good meal and a drink place. Food is great and our waitress Ariana (I'm sorry if I'm way off) was amazing. I'm sure she would have been even better if my 6 month son wouldn't stop flirting with her. Almost every waiter took the time out to stop and play with him which actually gives us time to eat. That alone makes it well worth it. I'm a sucker for customer service and this place has it."}
{"text":"Always exceeds expectations.    Good service, good food, nice wine list.   We will return next time we're in town."}
{"text":"This is my third visit.. The food is awesome! Today, Chef James made the most amazing Chicken Parmesan EVER!!!!! The chicken was tender and fried perfectly. The pasta was tasty and the sauce was perfect!!!! The BEST chicken parmesan I've ever had! I will definitely return for this dish and the many other delicious dishes served here! Everyone here is always so friendly! Thumbs up to management for picking such an amazing crew!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. After reading the great reviews, my husband and I were excited to try it for our weekly date night. 

Our saganaki was cold. I order the lemon chicken soup and the chicken was clearly over boiled--it was rubbery and hard to even choke down. My Greek salad and chicken was good, my husband had the veal and liked it.

The service was prompt and quick, which is nice BUT our waiter checked on us every 3 minutes--I'm not even joking. We wanted to sit and have a conversation which was hard because he was interrupting us every second--he was very nice and attentive and I could tell he meant well and wanted to give us a great experience.

If you want a good atmosphere, with mediocre Greek food, try it out!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever!! 1st strike running out of all items with scallops in dishes.  3 dishes on the entre menu has scallops on it. They had to know on Valentine's Day they would fill more tables- any good restaurant would be ready for this. It's understandable maybe. Order 2nd choice sea bass with two appetizers (4 taste of spreads and  calamiri ) wife orders lamb. After getting the 1st appetizer which took 15 mins the server comes out and tells us they ran out of sea bass. From my experience if the server puts the ticket in the kitchen tells them the are out. My thoughts he checks all his tables first before he puts his orders in. Wife's lamb comes out-  Ask when the 2nd appetizer is coming out? He goes to the kitchen and tells us it's almost ready. 15 more mins pass and he brings it out- at this point I'm ready to end the worst restaurant experience  I've ever had. Tell him I don't want the appetizer- he tells me it's on the house. I don't eat out to complain and get free stuff. I just expect to get my meal on a timely manner and would gladly pay for this. Summary $55 for 1 appetizer 1 beer and 1 lamb dish"}
{"text":"We have now visited Ilios Noche twice and have to say its been really good both times we have gone. We walked in early with no reservation and were seated right away. Service was excellent- friendly, accommodating and attentive. To start we shared the hummus plate, sizzling shrimp and grilled octopus. All were delicious. My husband had the chicken under a brick and I had the Greek spare ribs. The ribs were falling off the bone and fantastic. They come with these really thin sliced potato fries which were nice and crispy. The chicken was really flavorful and moist. We finished off with the baklava dessert. All in all we have had consistently good meals here and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food consistently served by servers that are rude and arrogant.  The bar staff, in particular, is borderline abusive and give terrible service.  After several experiences over 18 months, and in spite of their great menu, I will avoid it all costs."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner tonight and we were not disappointed.  Our server was Phillip and he was absolutely phenomenal, very knowledgable and friendly.  We ordered the humus, olives, chicken souvlaki, caesar salad, and the fennel and grape salad with lamb.  All of the food was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I was extremely happy to find out the founders are CIA alumni as well, it's always amazing to see what our alumni can do!!"}
{"text":"This is the bright shining star in this area.  Both lunch and dinner are always great.  The ambiance is casual but you can dress up and not feel out of place.  At night it gets loud so soft conversation is out but that's okay since you will be busy devouring the amazing food.  From tapas to pizza to lamb shank.   It's all good"}
{"text":"Been here 5 times and steadily declining... Food tasted okay.. Wasn't impressed for the price"}
{"text":"Returned for Valentine's day, service was way  better than last year.   Husband had lamb,  excellent.  I had my go-to capellini and scallops.  Scallops were perfect,  but the seasoning on the pasta was missing,  wasnt as delicious as usual.  I'll take my chances again though,  and I should have just sent it back but we aren't into doing that.  What stold the show was the amazing octopus appetizer.  Smoky and cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean restaurants that I have tried till now in Charlotte. I have been here 3 times and have never been disappointed. It has a very nice ambience and vibe  to it. They also have got covered outdoor seating. One must must try - Cucumber Tzatziki dip, Red Pepper dip and Zucchini & Eggplant chips. They do not have any vegetarian pasta on the menu but they did a vegetarian version of Crazy Lasagna for us and it was delicious. Have also tried their Harvest Pizza which I found to be average. Their staff is quite friendly and patient. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"While waiting for others, ordered a white zin for my wife, short pour IMHO.  Ordered a beer for myself.   WAS asked if I wanted a cold glass, beer was not poured into a chilled glass, thought I was in London, beer was warm.  No one came by to get the warm beer replaced.  Food was OK.  Service was just OK."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in south Charlotte. Ilios Noche has a fantastic lunch and dinner menu that offers great variety.  Everything is delicious and the staff is extremely friendly. Just be warned it can get really crowded for dinner on the weekends so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"it was my first time to this place with a group of my friends & it was right around the holidays. we had made reservations, but we were seated almost an hour later.  But this wasn't the fault of the restaurant but the party that had been there since 5.  When the manager knew how long we were waiting, he arranged for us to be seated right away and got us situated.  We also had a great server who was knowledgeable about the food on the menu. Being a vegetarian I ask every question you can think. He was honest in saying the fries are cooked in the same oil as the calamari so that was a no go. But I totally enjoyed atmosphere and the food. My only issue was the leftovers i had the next day seemed very salted.  I would request that they chef go easy on the sodium so it doesn't taste salty the next day. I will be returning to this place in the near future."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Food is so good.

Recently service (namely the bartenders) has gone downhill. They are not very friendly or attentive...or at least they weren't to me. 

Servers have all been great. Wish we had an Ilios out here in LA!"}
{"text":"We've been regulars for years. We were fond of the place and of the staff. It was a great neighborhood gem.  And then it was \"discovered.\"    

The scene on a recent Friday night included a live band with amps cranked to stadium level.  It's been difficult enough to hold a conversation on a regular night due to the noise level.  The music might have been decent, but who could tell as nothing, and I mean NOTHING, except for the table of screeching drunks, was audible over the drums.

Add in the smirking creepy old guy groping his very young female escort (crotch-length skin-tight dress) - well, you get the picture.  This is okay for a bar or club, but not a white tablecloth restaurant. 

The food is good, but not good enough to counterbalance the noise and the raucous crowds. Also, reservation times are not honored (add 15-30min).  We're giving up on this one."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch today and I was immediately turned off with wait staff. I was greeted warmly and seated quickly. That is where the quick ended. The wait staff here are slow and I cannot even emphasize this enough. SLOOOOOOOOOW. The waiter acknowledged my table, but walked by several times (it was not too busy when we arrived either). When he finally got to our table, I did need an extra minute or two to view the menu. Then I did not see him for 15 minutes. Literally 15 minutes. I almost walked out and just as I was about to, he arrived to take my order. From the order time, it took another 25 minutes to get the food. The food was just okay to be honest. Not bad by any means, but certainly not great, not given the time I waited. 

I don't know how anyone on a timed lunch could get in and out of this place in an hour or less. So if you are going to try it out, be prepared to wait. I certainly won't be back simply because of the wait times. The food is just not that stellar to wait that long."}
{"text":"Ilios Noche tries really hard to be an \"upscale\" restaurant but they're not. We've eaten there off and on since they've been open years ago. Each time we decide to go back, I'm reminded of why I'm not a regular there. The food is mediocre at best, portions are small, prices are high. Service level inconsistent. We notified management via their website of our poor dining experience the last time we went. I received a message from a manager(?) apologizing profusely, telling me they would be out of town over the weekend but would definitely contact me again Monday. That was weeks ago...I'm still waiting.
 
We're done giving our business to Ilios Noche. Oddly enough, one of the best restaurants in the Ballantyne area for breakfast and desserts is their sister restaurant, Big View. Kudos to them...their management team obviously have it together. Ilios Noche...not so much."}
{"text":"I went to Ilios Noche tonight in hopes of a better experience than the last three times I went there. No such luck. I ordered a Caesar salad with salmon. The bottom of the salad was a puddle of water. The salmon had no taste. I ordered the chocolate cake for dessert. It came out with some biscuit looking thing underneath the chocolate cake. When I asked the waitress what it was, she said it was a blondie brownie. It was hard as a rock. I couldn't even get my fork through it. The cake was cold and tasted like something that was bought in a convenience store. The ice cream had no taste. I cannot imagine a restaurant serving this. Our service was very slow and impersonal. Never going back!"}
{"text":"LEGIT!!!!!   YUM YUM YUM it was all good!!!!   We went here for lunch, party of 10.  Nice ambiance, friendly staff, waiter was spot on to include everyone that helped our table.

We started w/a few of the sample platters, awesome and the warmed bread is superb.  

A few of us got the lamb burger...HOLY S..T!!!!!!  YOU HAVE TO GET THIS!!!!!   IT IS HUGE, AWESOME, and DELICIOUS!!   I've had a few lamb burgers and this one hands down was the best i've had, others agreed.  

Table had everything from salad, chicken plate, pizza, etc.   Everyone enjoyed this meal and we will definitely go back!

Pricing was very reasonable and not overpriced for what you get and the quality of food."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my co-workers.  the food was very fresh and tasted great. they have lunch portion sizes which was prefect.  I am coming back for the Greek fries.  they were delicious.  The only problem was the waitress for a while I thought she forgot about us and then when she came back she asked if \"us girls\" were ready.  I didn't like it."}
{"text":"What a delightful experience we had today with every dish we chose and enjoyed. Bread and butter to start a pleasure, Salmon was exquisite, octopus delicious like always, pork ribs so tender and savorous, Moussaka's taste a temptation, sea food soup a delicacy, every thing incited senses and left a placid sensation to your spirit. And David knew how to made our day, excellent service and attention. Great evening and feast!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent dining experience at Ilios Noche. The food was fantastic and the service was excellent. The restaurant was very busy when we arrived so we opted for seats at the bar. The bar staff was very friendly and attentive and they answered several of our questions about the menu. I had the Chicken Lemonata and it was absolutely delicious! My son had the Hanger Steak and my husband had the Ilios Pita with Chicken.....to which he is still raving about because he loved it so much!

My only complaint is that it took almost 45 minutes to get our food. Luckily, we had the friendly and entertaining bar staff to keep us preoccupied while we waited. 

We will definitely go back again because the food was really excellent. However, we will only go on a night that we're not in a rush."}
{"text":"My husband, son, and I come here regularly for lunch and dinner. We really love the food here. I don't think we've had a bad thing. Our favorites are the calamari, the red pepper dip, zucchini and eggplant chips, Greek fries, lasagna, harvester pizza and chickpea salad. The spinach pie is incredible, too. I love ordering a salad with spinach pie on the side. The staff is so nice and really accommodating when we bring our little boy with us. The hostesses always seat us at a table where we'd be comfortable and have enough room for the high chair and, sometimes, stroller. Tuesday is half off bottles of wine and they have a good selection, although I do wish they'd include the reserve wines since half off of what the restaurant charges is the markup if I were to buy the bottle at a shop myself. We like to take out of town guests here and they always enjoy it."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted a new place to grab a quick lunch and she suggested IIios Noche.  

They have a cute little outdoor patio and a large variety of lunch options.

I went with a salad and added chicken.  All I read was candies walnuts, cheese, spinach , and balsamic dressing and they had me at hello .  I added grilled chicken.  

I was pleasantly surprised on how fast our food came out and the size of the chicken on my salad.  My water glass never went empty and our service was excellent!  I will be back!

On a side note, a friend had a baby shower here a few months back and everything was done wonderfully, so keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"Ilios Noche is a difficult place to classify.  We met a few friends there, and are glad that we went early, because even with a relatively small group (5), we barely fit on a weeknight.  This place gets packed.  Consider yourself warned.

As we had heard good things about the spreads, we tried some, and they were tasty indeed.  The Htipiti (no idea if I spelled that right) was our favorite, and I probably could have eaten it all night.

The staff - or at least our waiter - was awesome.  He helped us with the menu, gave us tips on the wine list, even brought out samples (hefty samples at that) when people couldn't decide, big thumbs up on service, something that you don't always find.

At the end of the meal, he even took me in the kitchen to show me the desserts because I couldn't decide which one I wanted.  Pretty cool.  Remember to tip your server.

The only thing that was somewhat disappointing was the main course.  That's not to say that everything is disappointing, or even that mine was, just that dessert was tasty (some sort of chocolate torte thing, but it was less cake-like than I would have expected) and the appetizer was awesome, the service was great, and the sandwich was pretty good.  The ends are great and the middle was, well middling.

By itself, it probably would have been quite good.  With everything else, so-so."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends. One thing I like about this restaurant is that it takes reservations on the weekend! We didn't wait long at all. Our service was good. We ordered a few appetizers. We were all happy with our meal and left the restaurant full. The ambiance is wonderful and it's close to the Ballantyne area. Parking can be a pain but shouldn't be too much of an issue. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The service was amazing and the food was good but not great. I had the Chicken pita which was good but the chickpea salad that I paired with it was overwhelmingly salty which I thought might have been my own taste buds but my lunch partner also said it was very salty. The upside is the tzatziki sauce. It was the best txatziki sauce I have had ever. All in all it was a good experience with great service and I would eat here again. I may not get the chickpea salad again however."}
{"text":"Focaccia bread was not oily/crispy enough and tasted like stale sheet cake. Server initially claimed that all of the pasta was fresh but backtracked after continued questioning. 

Mushroom pizza seemed like a cheese and arugula pizza because of how few mushrooms there were. The pizza dough was doughy and not crispy even even though the crust was thin and they put it in a brick oven. 

Baklava ice cream dessert - there's a ton of cinnamon in the baklava?! And the filo dough was not crispy. 

Just because this area of town is a food dessert,  standards shouldn't be lowered."}
{"text":"Amazing and I'm a snob about where I eat. 
The food makes me speechless!  It is fine dining without being overdone or too much. 
The staff is friendly, funny and knowledgable.
The decor is beautiful and sweeps me away to another place when I'm there."}
{"text":"Great food, but service is lacking. Waitress seemed overwhelmed & almost impossible to get a drink from the bar."}
{"text":"Nope. Overpriced and moderate food quality. I've been to Ilios often over the past 7 years, on the last year or so the food quality has declined and prices are up. Service is usually quite good, but staff has lately been light on busy nights and a lot of new faces. The owners focus may be drifting a bit. There are better options close by like 131 Main..."}
{"text":"I enjoy their summer menu more than their current fall/winter menu. Their food is fresh and so delicious. However, the service has been declining over the years. I waited about 20 minutes just to order my drinks. I ordered a side dish to come out with my entree and it came out much earlier than my entree.  I had to ask for my check three times and waited about 15 minutes to get my change. It was difficult to get my waiter's attention. I love their food, their service needs to improve."}
{"text":"Family had a really good meal here. The dirty martini was spot on and the food was awesome. I have one negative which kept this review to 4 stars. The marinara sauce on the chx parm was not good. I didn't want to hammer them too much over it since I am from New York and make sauce or \"gravy\" in my sleep and it also seems like no one in North Carolina can make decent sauce. My wife and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, change from the norm, friendly service, met 2 managers just to thank us for visiting our first time. Sincerely cared that our experience was good. A+ for customer service."}
{"text":"A cut above all other greek restaurants quality personified we chose to sit at the bar taste some wines eat at the bar our wait person clair was excellent answered our many questions made wonderful recommendations for food and wine we ordered a large greek salad split it and split the greek ribs entree both were better than all greek food we've eaten in usa and as good as food we've had in greece def recommend this restaurant cant wait to go there again"}
{"text":"We ate there Tues 4 20 2017 going out for our sons birthday. I would rate the dinner at best a 6.5. The menu is limited, the service was very slow and not organized. The food quality was a 7.0.  We would choose to not go there again."}
{"text":"Tried this place today with the whole family. Great ambiance, good selection. The kids enjoyed their meals, we enjoyed the tapas. We'll have to come back again for dinner. So far so good. I've only given them 4 out of 5, because I haven't gotten a complete experience and taste for the rest."}
{"text":"This great restaurant is kind of hidden back in the Quail Corners shopping plaza and it is a fantastic choice! They have really interesting cocktails that are sure to inspire your tastebuds. Thew few times I have gone, there has barely been a crowd or any wait, but we always choose to sit at the bar. 

The ambiance is very warm with the dark wood walks and low lighting - perfect for a date night. All the food is wonderful with a great mix of (mainly) Greek and Italian inspired dishes. All the wait staff is great - timely, friendly and knowledgable. 

Looking for an interesting drink choice? Try the Smokey in the Rye!"}
{"text":"Great spot to venture to for a quick, healthy and delicious lunch! I had the grilled salmon salad with the extra side of chick peas, and the serving size was just right. We had excellent service and the interior is very cute, but modern!"}
{"text":"This place is  diamond in the rough. You would never guess that you would find wonderful food and service in a shopping center. I have been going here for years and have tried almost everything on the menu and you can't go wrong with anything! Freshest ingredients in town and they offer a very unique menu...there is something for everyone. Ilios Noche is a place for any occasion and I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We had reservation at this place. When we got inside, the hostess tried to seat us at a table near the door, it was cold outside so we asked for another table since the restaurant was half empty. The decor is generic-upscale wanna be, there's nothing ethnic or cute about it.

We love Greek and Mediterranean food in general. We were very interested in this place and their take on that type of food. I'd say after dinning at this place that we enjoyed their appetizers more than their regular entrees. Their menu is too much of a mix of things, tries to please too much: pizza, pasta, some Greek dishes.

For appetizers we got the fried zucchini and eggplant chips (they were very good) w. cucumber yogurt and the meatballs (they're just OK). 

For entrees we chose their pork chops (read good things about them) which were big, too much meat, dry, kind of bland, I couldn't sense the lemon flavor or coriander (they were supposed to have). Their fries were good. The coleslaw with olives (not the most Greek idea for a dish in the world) came later, way after they brought the pork chops with the Greek Fries. If I pay around $20 for an entree, I want all the components  that are listed in the menu to be brought in the same time (it's just coleslaw). 

The service wasn't that great, they don't bring the coleslaw when they're supposed to, but then they keep coming to your table to rush you to finish the food with a typical question:\" Still working on it?\" - I'm eating, not \"working\".  Overall, this place doesn't have flavor in their food as well as in their decor.

 The food lacks the Mediterranean flavors and the place lacks the Mediterranean fun!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Their spinach pie appetizer works as a great meal. I definitely recommend this for a date night or just out with friends."}
{"text":"Delicious meal, very wonderful experience. I had the spicy jumbo shrimp as an appetizer with the lamb burger entree. The burger was cooked to perfection and the shrimp had just the right heat and flavor. My wife had the mushroom flatbread and it was amazing, highly recommend! The Greek Potatoes could use a little more garlic and/or flavor but overall, a wonderful meal! My wife and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys but on Valentine's Day really? The chicken lemon soup had no chicken and way too lemony. The chicken parmigiana was awful, worst I've ever had. Angry shrimp were good, hence the one star. Three tables of screaming kids topped it all off."}
{"text":"Just had the most awesome lamb burger in Charlotte! The Greek fries were so delicious I had to get another order to go!  Service was outstanding, as was Justin the bartender and waiter who served me.   Truly an overall outstanding Saturday afternoon lunch experience! So enjoyed the food, ambiance and service!"}
{"text":"What a swanky little place for a strip mall.  Really cool decor....rustic and modern.  The cocktails were pretty good....and they had a nice bar area.  The food was EXCELLENT!  I had the Grecian Pork Ribs with Greek Potatoes and Slaw.   It was delicious.  The Ribs were served piping hot and perhaps the most \"fall off the bone\" that I've ever had.  What really upstaged the ribs were the Greek potatoes ...they were delish.   

The Lukomades (for dessert) were incredibly fresh and tasteful!  Nice way to close out the meal.

The place was hopping and had a fine wait staff.   One head waiter...with several people including management rolling by the table to check in and make drop offs from the bar...etc.   They really took care of us without interrupting the flow of conversation at the table.

I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner tonight. Ordered the angry shrimp which were very angry but understandable as anyone would be if they were smothered in hot olive oil, garlic, and spice. Delicious and spicy. I ordered capellini with scallops. Flavor was excellent but I was a tad bummed about only getting 2 scallops. He got crazy lasagna which was a rich and delicious deconstructed lasagna with papardelle. He also got a lamb skewer. I loathe lamb. I think it stinks and tastes like armpits but not this lamb. This was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I reluctantly tried a bite and was very surprised at its yummy-ness. We will be back again."}
{"text":"With restaurant week in full force, we wanted to avoid the Queens Feast frenzy and enjoy an excellent meal.  Now, I have been pushing to dine here for some time now.  We were able to secure an 8:00 p.m. reservation (which is pushing it for my dad who starts asking \"What's for dinner?\" at 3:00 p.m.)  Needless to say, we were all famished when we arrived to be seated.  We waited for over an hour.  Actually we went and got a drink at Hickory Tavern next door to avoid stealing food from nearby tables.  Finally, after just over an hour, we were seated, and livid.

The manager TOTALLY saved our night with a round of drinks, and three delicious appetizers on the house.  The 4 dips (omg walnut and eggplant!), saganaki, and short ribs.  The short ribs are to DIE for!!  

For my meal, I ordered the striped bass, which comes with capers and is very lemony and fresh tasting.  I ordered the broccolini as my side which was fantastic.  I highly recommend the beef short rib entree with butternut squash puree, which was on special that night. The definition of savory.  The moussaka was also excellent, unlike any moussaka I've ever tried.  We were too stuffed to try any dessert, but it is a must for next time. 

Thankfully, the owner informed us that he is expanding the space.  Hopefully to avoid hour long waits for diners who have reservations!  The owner was genuine and very apologetic and made up for it so much that we can't wait to go back.

Delicious and eclectic food. YUM!"}
{"text":"This was an average meal. We ordered lots of tapas to try alone with fig pizza, soup, lamb sandwich, and tuna on the grape salad. The eggplant spread was not good. Lacked flavor and the bread is not good. Where was the traditional Greek bread? The zucchini chips were the best part of the meal. The fig pizza had two dry figs- Mainly cheese and arugula. I've had lots of fig pizzas and this was not the best. 
My salad was boring and lemon vinaigrette was all oil. My husband had the lamb sandwich that came on that not so good bread again. He really was disappointed. The veggie soup was good but salty.
We will try another Greek place next time."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was for lunch. I will be back but I wasn't really that impressed...except for the margarita, which was outstanding! :) oh..and the goat cheese peppadews...yum!

The hummus was horrible. It was dry and flavorless. very disappointing. The Tatzitki wasn't very good either. My gyro was just ok. Nothing to write home about. My husband loved his lamb burger, so that's another high point. 

Our server, bless his heart, was about as smart as a box of hair but he was nice. I'll go back but I'm not rushing to get there."}
{"text":"First visit, decided to get a variety of appetizers for the table so we could try as much as possible. Amazing food....completely addicted to the red pepper dip, and tatziki sauce! Falafel was crunchy and very well seasoned, chicken souvlaki moist and tender, greek ribs had a beautifully crunchy exterior but fall off the bone tender, well made risotto, good tabouleh & chickpea salads. Dessert was their flourless chocolate cake with coffee essence-a real surprise & treat with crunchy crumbly topping that made the dessert! Already planning our next visit!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love this place!!!! The food is just so refreshing and amazing!! My girlfriend had been trying to convince several of us to come here with her for the longest time since she loves it so much. We never made it until recently and I'm wondering why we never came sooner ;) 
We usually order a bunch of different plates to share and boy does the food not disappoint! Our usual to order is the angry shrimp, eggplant and zucchini chips, fried calamari, any one of their flat breads and a fish dish or grilled item. Regardless of what you may order, their food is on point! I will be returning sooner than later here :)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. Sat with my date at the bar which has a really relaxed and cool vibe. Ordered 5 appetizers which were all so awesome highlighted by the grilled octopus and pork ribs... phenomenal.  Tried the Smokey I(n the Rye which is just the perfect cocktail... so I had to order a few more. The food is so flavorful and fresh. When you couple that with a fantastic environment... it's one of the best restaurants I've ever been to and I spent the first 40 years of my life in New York. This place is no joke."}
{"text":"We had a very nice lunch at Ilios Noche yesterday with our toddler in tow. It's hard to dine out with a one and a half year old and usually waitstaff just tolerate the situation, but our waitress yesterday (Angie) was absolutely wonderful! She brought him crayons, cone cups to use as a paper hat, and made him a paper airplane. It was so nice to have a waitress actually helping to make sure that our little one enjoyed himself too. Mind you she wasn't just doing this because he was screaming or anything like that. Our son dines out with us several times per week since he was born, so, he's actually really good at restaurants. No, she was just naturally very engaged with all three of us and genuinely wanted us to have a good dining experience. 

The food at Ilios is actually really good - we've been eating Greek and Italian food for many years and have been to the Mediterranean more than a couple times. They're a bit heavy handed on the oils, but the ingredients are of a high quality and flavors blend together perfectly. The food here is craveable.

All of the staff members are friendly and service is prompt. Ilios would benefit from more light and air in the interior and ceiling fans in the outdoor seating area. That being said, I think you'll leave Ilios feeling satisfied overall. 

We are certainly interested in returning to check out brunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Love love love my Ilios Noche nights. Probably the best service in that whole area of South Charlotte and the food is undeniably tasty. Burrata is what food dreams are made of, the kids pizza is really tasty and even the salmon is \"lick the plate\" worthy!! They have a good private area for larger group functions and they are very good at providing exemplary service. We did have one bad incident as we ordered Loukamades that weren't cooked through..... But, we didn't REALLY need dessert anyway - so we looked at it as a semi-positive fail. ;) thanks for keeping things real and for being a reliable dining experience in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great variety of food and great service. Looks really nice in here too. North Carolina is full of great ppl. (We r from California)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. The appetizers were really good. We got the spicy shrimp in garlic tomato sauce. Flavor and spice were on point for this shrimp dish. The olives were very good and pretty unique of a dish. Never seen straight up assorted olives at any other restaurant before. The octopus had good flavor, but the texture was a bit mushy for us. I had the lambchops. It was cooked properly, but lacked seasoning. It was quite bland. One friend ordered a pizza and it was delicious. Another person ordered the seafood pasta. The seafood flavor was embedded in the pasta. That was very well done. The waitress was knowledgeable about her wine which always helps. She was attentive and kept us refilled. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food. It is a store front on Providence. Very relaxing with outdoor tables.

The hummus is great with fresh home-made pita bread.

I also loved the veggie salad-no lettuce just different julienned vegetables, oil/vinegar, and cheese. Lite and satisfying."}
{"text":"Great European food and high quality. Simple, good portions and good service. Try the meditation stripped bass."}
{"text":"Great lunch today. Ask for \"Chloe\" she will treat you like family.
Had the salmon sandwich and calamari. This place has some of the best calamari around ( coastal Italian specialty) and are served with home made aioli sauce"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was fantastic!!! Highly recommend it! We all loved out meals & our server Billy was so sweet!"}
{"text":"The best Tzatziki I've ever had and their grape and fennel salad is so unique and refreshing! Salmon and risotto also great eats!"}
{"text":"We had a good meal. The atmosphere and decor was energetic and modern. I would recommend the lamb shank. It was delicious. My husband had the pizza and didn't like the crust (too doughy). We were there on a Saturday night. It was very busy. I would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Went here on a date night, made reservations for 9pm after another event.  Event cancelled, so we decided to try and hit the restaurant early.  They told us it would be 30-45 minutes.  We grabbed a drink at the bar, and our 30-45 minutes turned into one hour and 10 minutes later, and them continuing to assist folks who we could overhear did not have a reservations and were just \"regulars\".  They allowed us to continue to sit here and wait walking past us over and over without even acknowledging us or even updating us as to an estimated seat time.

I get it, we showed up on a busy Saturday without a reservation, but seriously people, handle it with class and you will have a never ending stream of regulars.  Your hostess staff are doing your restaurant an incredible disservice.  We aren't in New York City guys.

We have been here before, food is excellent, solid spot for Charlotte, but service is just not there."}
{"text":"Passed by on the way home from a soccer game one night and were so glad we did. They have great drink specials and good food. I will say the calamari was a little dry for my tastes but it was still good. I had a great starter salad and I highly recommend adding anchovies to their caesar salad, they are marinated and very good. We each got pasta and the pasta was fresh and the dishes themselves fabulous. I could not finish mine because the portions are huge but Cort ate all of his and wanted more. The wine selection by the glass could be better for the level of restaurant but there were still good options. We did not have room for dessert."}
{"text":"Yum! I really enjoyed this place each time I went.  I got a lobster ravioli and it was delicious, with a special cream sauce. Very good service.  Will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! The is a great restaurant! The food was fantastic and the service was perfect. We got the lamb burger and risotto. My parents already want to go back for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience , lovely live music ( I went there on a Friday evening) , nice big wine menu . Had a variety of options ranging from pizza , Mediterranean and salads . Garlic bread was good , grilled asparagus was just OK and falafel sandwich could have been better but chickpea salad compensated for it ."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents while in town for the holidays - I ordered the Greek Farm salad with grilled shrimp, my mom ordered the Ilios salad with lamb skewer and my dad ordered the meatball appetizer as an entree.  It was very tasty and the service was really good!  Only complaint is that to add shrimp to my salad cost $6.50, and I got four, medium-sized shrimp.  SUPER tasty - but seemed a bit expensive.  Definitely recommend checking out Ilios Noche."}
{"text":"Ilios Noche waited long enough for me to visit after trying to make time to get here for 5 years! The Lamb Pie was so good I'll definitely be going back for more and of course to try other popular items.  So glad my friend recommended it! The arugula on top is the perfect accent to this hearty, but amazing dish!

Service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good. I love Greek food and this place serves it up.  The hubs, not so much. Typical guinea that doesnt like to stray too far from his beloved Italian fare. I ordered the Saganaki, which is fried cheese and it was tangy and chewy and delicious. I believe they fire it in a liquor. I also ordered Spanikopita, the spinach pie with Feta in Phyllo. It was so fresh and delciious. This portion was huge for an appetizer. The cheese isnt. You will NOT want to share the cheese, just sayin. So, Frank ordered the ribs that came with a slaw. They had an odd flavor that can almost be confused with being off. But, we think it was the herbs, probably coriander that we're not used to. They were cooked perfectly. Tender and meaty with a nice amount of fat that made the mouth feel very unctuous. The flavor was actually very good, just not what we're used to.  The slaw was ok, nothing special. We order the lemon potatoes on the side with Parmesan. Fuckin delicious. They were crispy and creamy inside with that nice tang of lemon and nuttiness of the parmesan. So good.Oh, and I almost forgot the HONEYBALLS, OR Lucamadis as theyre called. Very different from Aunt Lena's honeyballs or Struffoli, which I make TO DIE FOR, BTW.  These were big, not used to that. But, they were so light and fluffy with nuts sprinkled  on top and honey, which I asked for more off. Really good. Youu have to get those. Overall, I liked it a lot. I wont go back with Frank, but I will go back with my friends. It was delicous.  OPA!!!!"}
{"text":"Both locations have great service, and great food every time! I have been coming here for the past few years and never had a bad experience. My favorite place to eat in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Fantastic apps, service, and atmosphere.  My go to with my husband on date night!"}
{"text":"I got to say that this place is the best!
First chef Jorge and is staff are the best regarding there consistency to always provide request for anything !! Great job
The service is always from the young jay to Eric the newest manager and veteran like Shane the manager and of course David Daza , let's not forget about the man behind this restaurant Stratos Lambos and Angelo Kaltsounis and frank of course (he's the best pastry chef in Charlotte) , job well done !!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance [albeit noisy at dinnertime], nice mix of European dishes, wonderful service. Salmon entree was a little dry, but we ordered other entrees to share that more than made up for it. The Funghi pizza was one of the best I've ever had and I hear their octopus appetizer is to die for [they ran out by the time we got there though unfortunately]. Will definitely revisit the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint. The food tastes amazing, very fresh ingredients. Salty, but not too salty. Good sized portions. We split the chicken panini and it was more than enough for us both. The staff always friendly and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"I went to Ilios Noche this evening for dinner. I was shocked when I walked in and realized what a beautiful restaurant it was- it was a bit of a surprise for a restaurant in a strip mall and we were DEFINITELY a bit under dressed. Regardless, the staff never missed a beat. They were extremely warm and welcoming. Our waitress Mia was phenomenal. All three of us ordered the seared sea scallops with a mushroom parmesan risotto and it was absolutely divine! There was a rich marsala cream sauce that I will be dreaming about. It was the best meal that I have had in a long time. There are so many items on the menu that I am excited to try but it going to be a challenge to resist ordering that amazing scallop dish. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere (A)  Nice, clean, quiet, great ambiance
Location (B) strip mall, nice part of town
Food (B) good flavors, nothing was gross
Price (C) higher end prices for what you get
Portions (C) Did not leave hungry but did not leave with leftovers either 
Service (A) Very friendly waitress
Value (C) Maybe I'm cheap but if I spend $50+ for 2 people (not a first date either) I should  leave a bit more satisfied and with a full to-go container for lunch tomorrow.

Came here expecting some sort of casual Greek food with a slightly fancier menu, found mostly Italian-ish dishes some with slight Greek influence.  I got the \"deconstructed\" lasagna which was basically a bowl of sauce and meat with square noodles and melted cheese.  Totally a pain in the a$$ to eat.  Not worth $17.  My girlfriend got some sort of tube pasta with a weird tasting bolognese sauce (under-sauced as well).  I dunno, the few interesting things on the menu were $20+ and if I wanted to spend that much on \"Italian\" I would have just gone to Portifinos/Carabbas.  I guess I was expecting some high end \"street food-ish\" fancy shaved lamb gyros or kebab sandwiches or something but I'm just not feeling Greek/Italian fine dining fusion."}
{"text":"Food was nothing special. Not much seasoning. They couldn't get my wife's salmon right after two trys!"}
{"text":"Recently I dined at this restaurant as a guest for a wedding rehearsal dinner. It's always challenging to make everyone feel welcoming with a big group, especially on a Friday night when the restaurant is completely full, but the staff was great. 
We ordered some specialty cocktails which were yummy and the wine list was well thought out and reasonably priced. 
The appetizer plates they brought out were amazing, they were a section of their traditional mediterranean spreads. My entree, Livornese pasta with chicken, did not disappoint. 
The bride and groom picked this place because they went here on their first date and now I can see why they still keep coming back.
The only unfortunate thing was that I live in California and this restaurant is in North Caroline....ah well, I'll just have to plan another trip!"}
{"text":"It was Team Appreciation Day at the office and we decide to have catered lunch from this place.  It was good and everyone enjoyed!  My favorite was the salad and chicken wrapped in prosciutto.  The lasagna was okay. Staff was friendly. We'll order from here again."}
{"text":"The food is always good here and the ambience is great. Half price bottles of wine on Tuesdays add to the experience. 

We had a great Malbec, eggplant/zucchini chips. The chips are awesome. I had pork belly souvlaki which was tasty. I only wish they'd mentioned it was on a whole wheat pita which has a very distinct taste I don't like. Greek 'fries' are good. We ended with baklava and ice cream. Delicious. 

Have liked this place since it opened on Providence years ago."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, wonderful ambiance with outside dining option. Definitely a gem here in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Good, but value isn't there...pricey for what you get, especially in south Charlotte.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The hostess is terrible there was one couple in the  entire restaurant and said we could only sit in the bar area and I have a 2 year old. She said they were predicting that they would have a lot of people but yet they don't take reservations. So because they hire such stupid unfriendly people I'd suggest you eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"Absolutely top notch. Fabulous service, friendly smiles, and food that will knock your socks off! Chef James truly is an artist! 
Ilios noche is where I can bring my family and friends and know every time that it will be exceptional. Obsessed with the funghe pizza and Greek ribs!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I've been wanting to come for months to try their lunch special. My friend and I had lunch today and everything was so delicious. He had the lamb burger with Greek fries, I had the lunch special with salmon, Greek salad, and broccolini. The food was so fresh and flavorful. We both agreed that we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great service and food!! Kids all pick as go to Bday restaurant. Love the octopus and calamari apps!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Charlotte! That is really saying something, as I eat a lot lol.

What a lovely date night spot. Everything was so great! 

We began with cocktails. We had the Smokey in the Rye and the Made In. Both were excellent bourbon drinks. The Smokey in the Rye had a smoked glass, which was a nice presentation. The Made In was more like the Manhattan. 

Since it was our first time, they gave us a complimentary \"spread.\" Of course I was pumped about that! We chose the roasted red pepper as recommended by our waiter, and it was so good. The pitas were warm and grilled, and I'd like a jar of the peppers to put on just about everything. 

For our entrees we got the wild mushroom pizza and the sea scallops over a mushroom risotto. Holy cow both were so good! The pizza had very flavorful cheeze, delicious mushroom, and it was drizzled in truffle oil- my fav!  It was a small size, but very filling. The scallops were perfectly cooked. The mushroom risotto was to die for as well. My fiance' thought it was a bit salty, but I loved it just the way it was. SO GOOD.

Lastly, we splurged and got 4 ice cream tastes. We tried basil, vanilla, and chocolate nutella ice cream. The 4th flavor was apple cider sorbet. It was the perfect end to a perfect meal. The chocolate nutella and the basil are A MUST!

The meal was incredible from start to finish and the waiter was very helpful and attentive. We loved it and we will be back!"}
{"text":"After my first visit here I was a fan and couldn't wait to go back. But the second visit killed the hype and I'm not sure I will be going back. They were out of too many things for an 8pm dinner on a Friday; from fresh bread to wine glasses and a bunch of specials and sides! The servers seemed frazzled and tired, and it wasn't until we made a comment about the poor service did we even get napkins on our table... Sigh! The ambiance was still wonderful - 5 stars for that, the food was mediocre at best - our bread was stale, the eggplant and zucchini chips were okay, the funghi pizza was a little dry and our corvina unfortunately smelled quite fishy. The service was not so great - perhaps just growing pains from the new found popularity? We did get good wine recommendations from the bar manager, so plus points for that. On a less busy day I'm certain the experience would you much better."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service was disappointing. The hostess wasn't friendly at all and the waiter simply wasn't tuned in - the whole section was continuously looking for him. But again - fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Thanks to this restaurant, had a worst Valentine's dinner ever. We ordered taste of spread(4 of them), calamari fritti for appetizers. Sea scallops and striped bass for main dishes. Everything was good until the first appetizer, spread was served. Then the server told us that the sea scallops ran out of so we had to order something else. Okay, we changed the order to slow braised lamb shank. In about 20mins, the server came again and told us striped bass ran out of as well. 

What? Either the server didn't order it so we missed the last dish or the kitchen staffs don't know what they are doing. We just let it go. Then he served lamb shank before they even serve the calamari! We asked about calamari and he said it was ready. Then another 20mins passed. We already lost our appetite! 

Even though there was a manager walking around but he didn't seem to know what is going on. There is a big management problem with this restaurant. I checked the other reviews and they also mentioned about bad service and management.

The food? The spread was okay like the most of greek restaurants. The lamb was under my expectation. It was not as tender as I expected. (Trying to be fair for food review despite of bad service) 

I think their food is average and maybe some of dishes can be more than that. If you are lucky, you don't experience this worst service and can enjoy your food. Otherwise, you only get served two dishes other than four dishes you ordered. 
Good luck!"}
{"text":"We spent New Years here and it was amazing, they were very accommodating and the food was great! As always it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends, and sat In the bar area.  Nice enough looking place, and my first visit. The restaurant has a warm ambiance, and the service staff were friendly and welcoming.  The noise level wasn't bad, so you can have a conversation. 
The food OK, nothing for me stood out.  I ordered the scallops which comes with risotto, and I also ordered a side of Brussels sprouts. The scallops were cooked perfect and the risotto was good--I just don't think the portion for the price was good.  They forgot the Brussels sprouts, so trying to eat my course slow waiting for the side dish, but ended up finishing before they brought my sprouts--everyone was done with their meals.  Again, the price for the portion, I don't think is very good--nothing really blew me away warranting a second visit.   I think there are better values out there.  I can check this one off as having tried and on to another new restaurant."}
{"text":"Ilios Noche is a go-to for lunch with friends because it's close to my house and reliably good. I met a friend for a glass of wine last night and it was just as good as always. Many times when you say you only want a drink, a server will do a \"turn and burn\" and devote more attention to a party with a potentially larger check. However, our server, Paul, was very attentive, helped us select some delicious light bites and continued to check on us unobtrusively filling our water and even replacing our cocktail napkins. Delicious food, great service, just as we expected."}
{"text":"The food is ok the atmosphere is great. I feel like the prices are a little high for the food but being in the area they are I can see why the prices are higher I just wish the food was on par with the pricing!"}
{"text":"As other Elite yelpers have pointed out, there are plenty of authentic Mediterranean restaurants in Charlotte.  Unfortunately for Ilios Noche, the authenticity was left at the door.  While our food was good, we weren't overly impressed.  We started with the grilled octopus, which was by far the best dish we had all night.  For our main dish, I had the lamb shank and my husband had the marsala pasta.  My lamb shank was sans shank, which is a little weird since all the flavor comes from the bone.  My husband's pasta was bland and mainly made up of pasta, not a lot of meat or veggies.  Even my son didn't care for his mushroom pizza.  The bar seemed to be out of every beer & wine I ordered even though it was Saturday night and on the menu.  Overall, not impressed, and felt that we would have been better just ordering appetizers and salads.  If you want real Mediterranean food, then there a lot of other truly authentic restaurants around town."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful date night here just a couple of weeks ago. It had been years since I've been there but only because I'm rarely in the area. The special that night was swordfish on a bed of creamy cheesy risotto with a sauce over the top that was buttery and delicious. 

I can't forget the falafel appetizer. I've been to many restaurants and eaten falafel. This was the best. Most and flavorful. Each bite melted in your mouth. 

The server recommended the red blend house wine as the most popular. I recommend it now too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely shocked!   This place, for a strip mall, is so AWESOME!   Let me tell you about my experience.  We made a reso on Open Table for 7:30p.  We were seated at 7:25p.  The decor is very classy and yet has a rugged cabin feel to it.  It is very cozy!   The food was great.  I tried the pork ribs, and they were good but not as good as I would have imagined.  The slaw and flash fried potatoes that came with the ribs were OUT OF THIS WORLD amazing.  The taste of four appetizer was WOAH, drop your iPhone AMAZING. There was smoked eggplant dip, Greek cucumber dip, hummus, and a tomato based dip with EXCELLENT pita bread.  

The waitstaff were VERY knowledgeable about every aspect of the menu.  There were a lot of managers zipping around making sure the guests were well taken care of.  We asked for custom drinks that were not even on the menu, and they were made by the bartender to PERFECTION. The melon vodka martini we asked for was SO fresh.  

The bathroom was super clean and well kept.  Seating options are numerous and the almost every space was occupied by happy people enjoying their Greek food.  I would definitely come here again.  

Be aware that parking can be difficult, but that was the only issue I could find with my entire experience!!  

Happy eating."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. I can make a better lemon soup but the portions are really nice and I love that you can order a half portion.  I woudl go back. My daughter had the risotto and it was super good"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Everything was prepared perfectly and tasted delicious.  On the other hand, the service was terrible and ultimately took away from the experience.  The service was extremely slow even on a Sunday night.  The server couldn't pronounce items on the menu and I felt like I couldn't ask about anything on the menu because she would have no clue.  Also, the person delivering my dish thought my salmon was scallops."}
{"text":"When I saw they offer grilled octopus, it was a done deal. I made RSVP for dinner on Friday (to beat the romantic V-Day crowd) at 7:45pm. As most have already mentioned, it is well decorated with a nice ambiance, making it a good date spot in the SouthPark area that won't 100% break your bank. I do think that some of their 2-tops are quite closely put to one another - it was quite easy to be distracted by the neighboring conversation (and also the lack of space to put personal items such as bulky winter jackets).

We arrived slightly behind schedule, the hostess actually phoned me as we were 5 mins away. I appreciate the fact that they didn't just give our reservation away. Our waitress was quick to greet me while BF was still parking, yet she did not re-greet us for awhile once he arrived (and I could see her not occupied by other tables). Overall I think the service had room for improvement. 

I ordered the grilled octopus ($13) as my appetizer and it was absolutely divine. It came sliced, and it was a good amount to be shared (or in my case, I ate it all myself!). Perfectly cooked, every piece was tender and tasty. I highly recommend the octopus (and it's a much healthier alternative to the fried calamari)! 

For dinner, BF went with the Margharita pizza, which for $9 was a very big portion. Definitely enough to be an entree. I opt for the full size Capellini ($20) once I confirmed that the sea scallops are served whole (they offer half size option for most pasta dishes - but for $4 more I figured I could save half for a 2nd meal). The scallops turned out to be quite sizable - 4 of them, sitting on the pasta. I don't think this dish could ever be \"pretty\" but I care most about the taste. Thus imagine my disappointment when I was overcome by the blandness of everything. The pasta tasted like nothing, even the scallops were bland. How on earth something with so much butter, garlic and pancetta tasted so blah was beyond me! I even asked for shaved parm (since we were never offered any) to see if that would help with the taste - but the 100% lack of sodium wasn't something easily fixable. 

I was this close to surrender, I thought I would just pack my entire dinner home so I could redo it myself at home. My BF hates to complain in restaurants and was scared to death by the possibility
 that I would make a scene (men... I swear). But I ended up speaking up when waitress came by to check on us. She insisted for it to be recooked. Manager Jodi followed up as well, and promised the dish will be tasty. 

Take 2 was definitely a great improvement. I hope the kitchen could agree that I wasn't being crazy but I think someone forgot to put salt in the 1st one. I enjoyed my dish and thought it was of decent value. I do, however, wish my waitress remembered to bring me cheese (if I asked for cheese the first time, I thought it's reasonable for her to bring cheese the 2nd time, or at least ask if I still wanted any cheese). 

In the end I think it was a solid dinner - the food ended up being great. The service was average, they could be more mindful about the little things like offering fresh pepper/cheese (and we never had bread... I read that bread was offered in other reviews). I will revisit, if anything just to have the octopus again."}
{"text":"As a Greek-American, it doesn't get better than Ilios Noche on this side of the Atlantic. HIGHLY recommend the youvetsi as well as the spanikopita. A little pricey and the drinks werent my favorite (which would normally be a reason for me to give them 4 stars), but dear lord that food was amazing."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday evening with 6 other people to celebrate a few November birthdays including mine. I know every restaurant is different and may not even care enough but I wrote it in our reservations and I guess this restaurant is one of the restaurants that doesn't really care because our waiter was surprised when one of us told him that we were there to celebrate a few people's birthdays. I couldn't even hear him when he introduced himself because it was pretty loud in there and the live music didn't help but our waiter is the only reason I'm giving it a 3 star instead of anything lower. He was enthusiastic, funny, and perfect as a waiter for a big group. I didn't think the appetizers and entree that I had was all that good. We had the fried calamari and angry shrimp. The angry shrimp was honestly a waste of money. 4 pieces of shrimp for like $12? Really? If I knew that there was only 4 shrimp then I wouldn't have gotten it. I've had better fried calamaris elsewhere. Ordered the roast chicken and again I've had better roast chicken elsewhere. The free birthday dessert that our waiter brought out was nice and pretty interesting. It was like a cinnamon cake thing with a scoop of vanilla icecream. Overall the restaurant looks nice but the food just wasn't special enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding!  I tried the grilled octopus &  the fungi pizza both amazing.  You can taste the truffle oil in the pizza.  Service excellent too¬°"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. It want the best Greek food I have ever had but it was quality. I ordered Saganaki and Scallops, both were appetizers and were very good. But the real star was the Moscow Mule cocktail. It has been the standard by which I will forever judge this drink.  To top it off we had a great server!"}
{"text":"Really good lamb burger, didn't like the bits of red onion in the meat though. The lamb sandwich was good but not as the burger. Will try the ribs and other items when I return. Nice lunch spot !"}
{"text":"This place is a great dinner spot for south Charlotte without driving towards the city. They have quite a large menu with choices from traditional Greek dishes to other dishes with Greek touches (pizzas, pastas). I had one of the pasta dishes which tasted great and everyone else in my group wanted to try. 

The decor of the place is very stylish. Rustic but very classy and updated. Think Restoration Hardware. Great setting to have cocktails, which were very well made also.

The one tough part is parking. The lot fills up very quickly at dinner time and we had to park by Harris Teeter. Consider making a reservation for peak times- the waiting area was quite crowded but we didn't have to wait having made one."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and exceptional service! We had the brick oven pizzas and they were to die for! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would rate this establishment 3 or 4 stars. It is a Greekian or Italeek ( pronounced- it ta leek) cusine. Bet you never heard of this before. It is my pathetic effort to name a new fusion category. Very interesting fun menu. 

The restaurant has great atmosphere and very good service. I appeared at lunch and had no wait.

I ordered the Greek salad and wood fired Salmon. The Greek salad was exceptional. very fresh, perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of dressing.

The Salmon was very good but not as wood fired tasting that I expected. Nevertheless, it was delicious and very moist, perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"OMG!! All Around Superb!!

I had never heard of this place before, but had received a coupon for a free appetizer and went for brunch. The service was excellent, our waitress Anna G was on top of everything! She brought our drinks right at noon (Sunday), continuously checked on us and made us feel very comfortable. The manager stopped over a few times too to see how everything was going and was pleasantly friendly. 

The food was delicious and came out pipping hot! The app we got was the Zucchini and Eggplant Chips - SO SCRUMPTIOUS!! The poached eggs were cooked to perfection and the drinks were splendid!

Best tip about this place: Large portions!! for everything, even the sides that come with the entrees are huge portions."}
{"text":"Service was so odd! The server would not stop saying he was sorry. I mean he would apologize for things that were completely unnecessary to the point I and other were uncomfortable. Also the seats were EXTREMLY uncomfortable to the point of minor back pain. Food was all around disappointing not nearly as good as my time
Before on Prov. Rd location. I was expecting better but it was like a sinking ship
That sunk and then sunk again! Maybe it was a bad day but it was one of my worst experiences to date!"}
{"text":"Once again was not let down by Illios. Another by far fabulous experience. Not only was the food on point, but the customer service is above and beyond. Businesses have fallen short on this aspect lately however this restaurant remains true. From entering to leaving they treated me and my husband like royalty. Our server Eric was extremely accommodating,went above and beyond on service level also was extremely knowledgeable about the food and beverages. You do not find servers like this nowadays that believe in the quality and culture of the restaurant that they work in. Once again,  incredible experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I have meet for a drink and to share a plate a few times before so thought we would try it again.  I sat down at the bar to order a glass of wine and asked the bartender for a recommendation for a red blend. One recommended was nice, so I asked for a pour.  All was fine, except for one of the plates that we shared was so salty that we couldn't eat it.  We enjoyed out visit with each other and decided to end the night.  Then the bill came and I was shocked to see a $60 charge for 3 glasses of wine!  When I questioned the very young barkeep about the charge, all she did was smile.  Funny the bartender who recommended the wine didn't come over to answer my questions.  Shame on me for not checking out the prices of wine when they were recommended to me.  Shame on the bartender to recommend one of the most expensive glasses of wine they carry without being upfront and honest, not giving me a heads up the price.  A good bartender is trusted by their customers and gives all the information they need to make a decision.  Although I went ahead and paid the bill because of course I drank the wine, I won't go back since I felt completely taken advantage of!"}
{"text":"I dined here with some friends this past weekend.  I have Celiac and one of my friends is 7 months pregnant, so needless to say we had some dietary restrictions.  Not only did they offer a gluten free menu, but our charming waiter was just as accommodating as he was entertaining.  I ended up ordering scallops and potatoes.  My only complaint is that there weren't more of each!  For dessert I had a decadent pistachio chocolate torte.  I already look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"My 10 year old son, and I stopped in for brunch, while celebrating his birthday. Food was excellent!! Service was even better. Sergio was our waiter, and he was A+. The only thing bad about this place, is its 2hours from my house. If ever in the area again, most definitely will eat there!"}
{"text":"What is happening here?  A favorite of mine since they opened.  Horrible service, last week the owner openly berating staff and I ask myself why did I come again.  I Just realized that eating at Ilios  is a habit I have to break.  My favorite lamb burger over cooked the last two times and the second round no better.   Looking forward to the new restaurants opening across the street within the next year."}
{"text":"In every possible way, Ilios Noche was fantastic - I don't use this word often, but it's the first word that comes to mind when I think back to my experience here. 

Everything that makes up what a restaurant is - the food, service, ambiance - was top-notch. 

FOOD: I started with the Country Greek salad and my husband had the Mesclun salad. I didn't think it was possible to have salad THIS good. The Mesclun salad, especially, was a beautiful explosion of harmonious flavors. Yes, from a salad! For my entree, I had the Crazy Lasagna. Delicious, and never had anything like it before.

SERVICE: The sommelier was our server. I unfortunately do not recall his name, but he was wonderful. Very attentive. When we asked for suggestions on wines to pair with our dessert, he brought out 3 glasses, thoroughly described each of them, and left them for us to enjoy. While having dessert, the general manager came by to say hello and thanks for dining with us. 

As a former NYC resident, I've tried a good amount of noteworthy restaurants. Ilios Noche surpassed many of the ones in NYC. 

This is the restaurant that has changed the way I now give 5-star ratings. 
Can't wait to return to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I'm done with this place. I have come to this location three times. The first time was about two years ago and the service and food was stellar. I'm not sure what has happened here but it has gone downhill.
My second visit was about six months ago. I sat at the bar and the manager and the owner stood at the opposite side of the bar watching noisy videos on their phone! I'll admit that it wasn't busy but really??
Today I sat at the bar again for lunch. The bartender was surly and acted like he had better things to do than wait on me (like disappear to the back and check his phone).
The manager (I guess that's who she was) walked around the bar and said \"what the he**\" as she was  apparently frustrated about a phone call from a customer that she had to answer. 
It seems as though the staff is just either burnt out or just doesn't care anymore. What a disappointment."}
