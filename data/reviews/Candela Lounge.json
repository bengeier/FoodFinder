{"text":"My first experience at Candela had us leaving after 30+ minutes without even so much as getting drinks. This was when they first opened, so I decided to try it out and see if things had improved.  I had high hopes, but none of them met. The food, what everyone really goes to a restaurant for, was alright. There was nothing special about the dishes and they were way too overpriced. $18 for two medium sized scallops?!  The chorizo and gnocchi were fine, nothing especially exciting on the palate. They were mostly tomato based without much further seasoning. The best dish we had was the crispy pork belly.  The cocktails were tasty, but again, nothing special. The service was more attentive than my first visit, but again not what I would expect from this caliber of restaurant. While Candela is only a few blocks from my home, I can't really see myself going back there."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for tapas/small plates in the city. Just about every dish we've tried has been good. Get the fried olives, and the veal brisket with the polenta."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I was invited to a friend's going away party. He and his wife were moving to Toronto.  They planned their party in the private room at Candela, a relatively new Tapas/Mezze Bar/Restaurant.  Its from the same group that brought Calgary Alloy.  The space was designed by McInley Burkart, well known and talented architects in Calgary.  They took a strip mall and turned into a fine dinning lounge.  I spent most of the night sipping on Hendrix Gin, my fave... No wine was imbibed.  Everyone at the table decided to share, so we share a slew of Tapas.  They were all good... None of them were great.  The plate that stood out most in my opinion was the Tempura Fried Broccolini with a Sweet Chilli sauce.  Very tasty.  Everything else was OK.  I will definitely go back,  and recommend you go for lunch or appies after work.  (http://fyoufoodie.com/2013/04/15/candela-the-people-from-alloys-take-on-tapas/)"}
{"text":"My friend and I dared to show up without a reservation on a Saturday night, knowing it would be packed, as it had just opened. The friendly hostess told us it would be about a 40 min wait, and we were directed to the bar for a drink. There were no chairs at the bar, as there are tables right behind, so it was a bit awkward having our derrieres really close to some people trying to enjoy dinner.  Lucky for us, we only waited ten minutes until being seated. Im a big fan of the tapas style menu, and Cadela's had quite a few options organized neatly into columns.  We tried so many different plates, that Ill just say every single one was amazing, and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"I went to Candela with a group of about 12 girls for a birthday celebration. We sat in the private dining room.  The Good: - Food was reasonably priced.  - Our server was friendly.  - Food was overall really yummy - the buñuelos were the best dessert I've had in ages. - The private room is a great venue. Nice atmosphere and felt private  The Bad: - The servers bringing out the food were less friendly. They didn't know who ordered what are seemed annoyed that multiple people had ordered the same things.  - Paying at the end was a nightmare. Big parties are never fun but don't offer to split up the bill unless you are certain you can get it right. None of the splits were right. We would have rather had a big bill and figured it out ourselves.  - The overall atmosphere in the room was great but there was a giant centre piece on the table. It was virtually impossible to see or talk around. When dining with a big party it's nice to see the other side of the table.   Overall I would go back and recommend to others. They have a few kinks to work out as a new restaurant but they are on the right track!"}
{"text":"This place had me very curious.  Fun design on the inside, great location, and consistently full parking lot.  Don't be fooled though, this is just another Calgary disappointment.  The wine by glass list is poor, especially considering the product we have on the market here.  The bartender didn't have much clue about it either.  The Cava we ordered by glass had been opened way too long before, leaving barely any effervescence in the glass.  We were never offered water.  The tuna Ceviche was okay, but not exciting by any means.  The scallop Ceviche comes in a bowl but the scallop is not even cut into bite size pieces, nor is it served with any sort of chip.  It was however served with a spoon so I suppose one is just supposed to eat it that way.  We did ask for chips and they were quite good-perhaps even made in house.  As the scallop Ceviche was pretty low on the flavor index, I ordered a side of pico de gallo to try with the chips.  This was also not too bad.  Then the chorizo came.  No surprises here, no creativity with plating, and no excitement.  Just cut up chorizo in a bowl with a bay leaf.  Quality of meat was average.  The flank steak followed this and was one of the better items we tried.  For $11 you get 5 little bites of flank steak with a chimchurri sauce, a dollop of aioli, and homemade potato chips.  Good.    If you are talented in the kitchen and regularly dine in other cities, I would skip this restaurant.  However, If you are a fan of Alloy, the first restaurant by this group, you would probably also enjoy Candela.  The two have many similarities.  Like Alloy, Candela seems confused in it's focus.  The atmosphere, service, food, music, and overall impression have left me completely dissatisfied and not at all likely to return."}
{"text":"A few notable things: 1) kitchen is open late 2) cozy ambiance (despite very confused decor)  3) tasty cocktails (inventive yet not overly pretentious) and 4) awesome bartender. A few things that need to be addressed: 1) a hovering-when-present, but M.I.A. in half-hour intervals, questionably intoxicated server 2) menu gets boring after a few visits and 3) bad wines-by-the-glass.  Overall, I like the feel of the space and food is good, but since it is tapas-style dining, after about 3 visits, I think i've tried everything on the menu. Nothing is mind-blowing, but everything is just \"good\". Not a single wine offered by the glass was memorable (yes, i've tried them all) - stick to the cocktails."}
{"text":"Two to three dishes recommended per person. Unique flavor combinations and every dish served hot & expeditiously. Service was pleasant and very attentive. Do try the ceviche, hummus, short rib and cauliflower. Fresh, inventive cocktail menu made with fresh fruit mixes."}
{"text":"My wife's and my new favorite date night place is Candela Lounge.  We really enjoy the fact that we can sample so many unique flavours all in one outing. We have yet to try a dish that we did not like and are quickly forming some \"go to\" favorites. I like the fact that all dishes are made for sharing.   Another plus is that even when this place is full, conversation is easy with sound levels not as high as you would expect in an open environment like this. I do not know if it is by fluke or design."}
{"text":"Candela deserves a glowing review - the atmosphere, the food, the wine and the service were fantastic!   We had plans for dinner on Saturday with 14 of our friends; partly as a birthday celebration and partly as a long-overdue catchup. I had planned to make a reservation well in advance, but unfortunately procrastination kicked in and I found myself calling around with 3 days notice trying to get a reservation for 14 people! My hopes were dwindling I called Candela who luckily its private dining room available - and seats 14 people perfectly!  The private dining room is an absolute pleasure to dine in, with a great view of 4th Street on one side and windows into the kitchen on the other. The table is a rectangular shape, which made cross-table conversations possible and there was plenty of space for us to mingle prior to sitting down for dinner.   The food was delicious - the beef short rib tacos are a must try and were a hit with everyone. The calamari and cheese & meat platter were also amazing - and best of all they were all gluten-free! We even found a great bottle of wine on the feature list, and at $51 we got a great bottle of wine for a pretty reasonably price.   This is just a fantastic restaurant... add it to your short-list of restaurants that you must try in Calgary!!!  -- L"}
{"text":"I was very excited to eat here but was extremely disappointed.  The food was nothing special (Korean tacos, meatballs and calamari),  the menu seemed confused with a bit of an identity crisis.    The service was subpar, we were forgotten about despite sitting at the bar in view of the staff. A group sitting next to us also seemed to have an issue with their seating and it was embarrassing watching how the staff handled the situation.  Cocktails were below average.  Food, service, vibe all below average."}
{"text":"Seeing as Candela advertises itself as the only place serving \"real\" tapas, my husband and I figured we would check it out. However, we were really disappointed to learn that it's really just a mass market small plates restaurant masquerading as a tapas bar.   Let's start with the wine list. There were two - and only two - Spanish reds on the menu. Enough said there.  On to the food menu. There are 4-5 items on the menu that I would recognize as being authentic tapas - chorizo, patas bravas, tostadas, a meat and cheese platter, a few desserts. However, the tostadas were salmon, served on rice crackers, and clearly had just been removed from the fridge pre-assembled. Nasty and limp. The meat and cheese platter had a measly three slices of Serrano ham, some speck (German), some Genoa salami (Italian) and some air-cured buffalo chorizo (Canadian), a few random cheeses that the waiter couldn't even identify, and some jarred pickled vegetables.   The service was awful - the waiter said twice that he was having a \"brain fart\" over the cheeses, which is not the most appetizing thing to have said to you when you're eating, and then came back to enthuse, unnecessarily, about how \"stupid awesome\" the buffalo chorizo is. Dude, that chorizo has been on every mass-market meat and cheese platter in Calgary since 2000.   We had intended to order another round of tapas, but the quality was so disappointing that we decided to move on after our first two items.   I have granted a second star because the cocktails we had were exceptional.  Beware - it's the Moxie's of tapas!"}
{"text":"I went to Candela last night with two girlfriends and was really excited as I had heard many great things about the place.  I liked the layout and ambiance and found it to be really cozy.  I got there first and was immediately asked about water - I love that they have unlimited sparkling for $2 per person!!  We were sort of slow to order as one of my friends was running late and I felt that our server was put off by this.  Whenever she came to the table it was as if she was doing us a favor and she barely cracked a smile the entire evening.    We had the chorizo, the adobo pork and the kale salad.  I loved all the plates but they were very small for the prices.  We also got the lobster risotto and I was pretty disappointed.  It took about 45 minutes to arrive, the lobster was very overcooked and the whole dish was not great.    All in all the food was nice, the ambiance was great and I had a good time.  Unfortunately our server made the experience less than delightful.  It pretty much took away a lot of the likability of the entire place.  I was also surprised that we never saw a manager.  Perhaps they should spend a little more time out front observing their staff to ensure customers are having the best experience possible.  There's too much competition in Calgary these days to be mediocre......."}
{"text":"Where to start...  Well, it's new!  Tapas are super delicious. Best of the evening? Tuna ceviche, but I will be happy to try short rib, fennel, calamari, paella and swordfish all over again!  Dessert... Bunuelos! small, crispy with a soft center,and you get to dip them in dulce de leche.  Service? Excellent, really friendly and professional, you are well taken care of.  Definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"You can tell that a lot of thought and effort has gone into Candela.  Everything from the decor, the chairs and the lighting to the menu's food and beverage options just seem to... fit together, in a way that doesn't mesh quite as well as at other places.  Our server was amazing and introduced us to the restaurant's concept as well as sharing his thoughts on which dishes were his favourite.  The Tuna Ceviche wasn't exactly what I expected - rather than small pieces of cut up tuna, each slice of tuna was placed atop a square of watermelon.  This made an easy-to-share tapa that we all enjoyed.  One of the highlights was the Fennel - which was roasted and topped with goat cheese, pomegranate and orange making it an unusually delicious combination.  The Striped Bass, with crispy skin, was well seasoned and served with large saffron israeli couscous.  It was one our favourites, although it was a bit more awkward to share, because you had to cut the fish into pieces.  The Chicharron, Beets, and Bok Choy were also favourites at the table.  Our only regret is that we didn't have room to try the many other tapas that look incredible.... Oh well, we'll have to be back another time!  Review #5 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"What can be better than killer cocktails and tapas dishes that change early and often. We've been here twice and the food and the service has been outstanding both times. Going in to detail on the dishes doesn't help much because the menu changes so often that it's printed on your paper placemat!"}
{"text":"Congrats to Candela for coming in 2nd place for \"Best New Restaurant\"  and 3rd place for \"Best Decor\" in Avenue's 2013 Food Issue (www.avenuecalgary.com). After dining there last week,  I think Candela deserves this recognition.   The decor is modern Moroccan chic with vintage silver lighting, tile floors and really quirky black-and-white framed art along its back wall (these were my favourite decorator pieces!). Oh and the lighting in the large group dining area was perfect.  Food-wise, the tapas are solid and creatively conceived. There is a solid selection of tapas influenced from flavours around the world: Mexican, Spanish and Asian. Definite must-trys include the ahi tuna ceviche (the water melon is so refreshing and a nice change from rice) and the chicharron (deep fried pork with sinfully tasty crispy skin served with black bean puree, sour cream and salsa). My favourite dessert was the chocolate pot au creme- it has a nice spicy kick! The cocktail list is also fun; I had a delicious bourbon based drink with fresh cherry puree.   Candela would be a great place for a date, post-work cocktail or girl's night out.  We love supporting our local Mission eateries and businesses. Candela is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood and Calgary's dining scene."}
{"text":"I seem to be in the minority here. I had high hopes for Candela due to the reviews, but unfortunately was not blown away. Candela was not bad by any means, but it was not spectacular either.  We had a variety of dishes: - Braised short rib - Japanese eggplant - Tuna ceviche - Some sort of taco (which I cant remember because it honestly was not that memorable) - Some sort of dessert which I also cannot remember   They were all okay. Nothing stood out, or made us go 'wow!'. Service was spotty. Our waittress seemed a bit overwhelmed and forgot one of our plates but went back to the kitchen to get them when we reminded her.  The cocktails were the best part of the night. I had the rhubarb mojito, which was really nice. My dining partner had another cocktail which he seemed to enjoy.  3 stars at best.   Review #25 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"We went to Candela for our Valentine's dinner and it was fabulous!!  I had left it until the last minute to make a reservation and of course every place I considered was booked up, but when I called Candela they recommended coming in a little early and eating at the bar.  I was told if we were there by 5 pm we'd be fine and we were!    It was not packed but full.  We got great seats at the bar and it felt kind of like our own space complete with romantic lighting via a lamp.    Arriving at that time and sitting at the bar was perfect.  We had friendly prompt service!  Drinks were in hand the moment we sat down.  We put or order in and the food starting coming out quickly.  It was wonderful!    We both got the Blackberry Bramble cocktail to start.  It was fruity and perfect.  Went down a little too easy.    For food we went with mixed greens and the calamari to share.  All I have to say is.... Oh My God good!!  The salad was yum, but the calamari was amazing.  Now, I'm not a calamari connoisseur by any means as it's a dish I've just started enjoying, but it was delish!  I'd go back for that alone.    I got the veal and hubby got the shrimp tacos.  Both were very good.  For dessert we shared the chili chocolate pot du crème.  It was delicious and the perfect end to our meal.  We sat and had another drink before leaving.  This time we tried the Irish Chocolate.  Also very good, but tasted a little stronger than our previous beverage.  I thoroughly enjoyed it as I did our dinning experience!"}
{"text":"Wanted a relaxed atmosphere to have some drinks and catch up with friends. The low tables, comfortable seating, and low noise level were perfect. We had all eaten but took a good tour of the drinks menu, particularly the unique selection of cocktails. The tapas menu looked delicious, can't wait to go back hungry! My boyfriend insists that I mention we were charged 2$ for each pitcher of water, which they refilled without asking. I was pleased that they kept my water full, I was very pleased with the attentive and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I had my birthday here in the private room. The service was amazing, the waitress was very knowledgeable about both the menu and the wine.  The food was great. We ordered almost everything on the menu.  The short rib was delicious, melt in your mouth.  Scallops were great, as was the tuna tartar.   My friends were disappointed in the cheese and meat board. Overpriced for what you get.  I was disappointed in the root beer float dessert. Tasted nothing like root beer and was quite dry.  I would recommend this place to others, just know what to order!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent here and the service was way above average.  Someone said service was poor and I just can't imagine why I thought just the opposite.  Some of the items weren't my favorites (a little heavy) but most delivered what they promised.  This is trendy and upscale so don't expect otherwise but if you are in the mood for a delicious cooktail and tapas then that is exactly what you will get with a big smile."}
{"text":"It was hubby's birthday so we made a reservation to check it out, have a wonderful time and see what all the fuss was about. We walked in after coming from Anejo where we had some drinks. Wow, what a difference! There was a bar here but this is for sure a sit-down dinner type of place. The retro floor, the red velvet booths and mismatched chairs were unexpected as were other aspects of this restaurant. Back towards the bar it was modern and beautiful and more of what I expected the restaurant to look like. The washrooms were gorgeous too, like the bar. There was funny, weird art on the wall near the washrooms. Just nothing seemed to fit together in this place and maybe that is what was intended.  There is a nice private room that would accommodate 12 people at the back near the bar. Our waiter was great and explained the menu and answered any questions we had. I myself would describe this place as Latin/Asian fusion. You get chopsticks with your tapas no matter what you order! Ordered: the rhubarb mojito I had read about - meh, I would never order one again. The glass was so full of rhubarb, I think it absorbed all my alcohol! I choked this drink down as it was not so good. $12 Also ordered was a rum and coke for $16. Crazy $. Then the food - pork bellies (not for me but hubby loved them and how they were prepped), the calamari which was really nice with coconut and lime and the shrimp tacos - very small, you get 3. As a nice gesture, our waiter brought out a little bowl of fruit mixed in with tequila and a cream whip on top that was to die for. I could have eaten a liter of that. Apparently the chef is from Columbia and he did a really nice job with the food. By 7pm, the place was packed. I won't come rushing back but was glad for the experience of it."}
{"text":"Flew into Calgary and met up with a friend who brought me here right away. Neither of us had been here but we'd heard good things. Loved this place.  I had the syrah, grenache, mourvedre blend by the glass and my friend drank prosecco. We shared the tempura broccoli, beet and goat cheese salad, calamari and chicken tacos. We couldn't help ordering a second broccoli tempura! It was that good! And I really liked that the beet and goat cheese salad was mostly beets. Layered beets on the bottom, topped with the arugula and two balls of goat cheese beside it. Lovely.   Loved the extensive list of small bites, 2 or 3 a person is a good start and great for sharing. The atmosphere was super cute and relaxing. No complaints, would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hits and misses, but it'll cost you a pretty penny to find out (unless you're fortunate enough to read the reviews ahead of time). Finally made it in here for lunch but was disappointed with some of the dishes, especially considering Candela's perceived reputation and price point.  Crispy Pork Belly...5 stars. Excellent! Perfectly prepared cubes of porkbelly...a light but flavorful crispy exterior and tender, juicy interior. The light green apple slaw helps to balance the hardy protein, but still, you'll want to order a carb or veggie dish to tame the porkbelly's immense flavors!  Vegetable Tempura...4 stars. Tempura broccolini, carrots, and yams drizzled with a candied ginger sauce. This is a nice take on the Japanese staple. The vegetables are perfectly fried but needed a few more seconds on the draining tray/plate...the tempura was a bit greasy on some of the vegetables. Also, it would've been nice to have the ginger sauce on the side as the bottom vegetables had little to no sauce on them. In addition, a side of soy sauce would've made use of the accompanying pickled ginger slices and as an alternative for those who didn't care for the sweet ginger sauce.  Calamari...3 stars. Fried mini calamari rings and tentacles topped with ancho chili mayo, coconut sprinkles, and lime salt. Well seasoned calamari and tasty toppings..it's a nice blend of the sweet and savory, almost too much for the taste buds to handle (but in a good way). Unfortunately, the dish was held back by an exuberant amount of oil...just way too much grease left at the bottom of the dish, as well as on many of the calamari pieces leaving them soaked and soggy.  Beef Short Rib Tacos...3 stars. Shredded beef short rib topped with sour cream and mango salsa. A generous portion of short rib in each taco. There's plenty of sour cream, as well, and just a touch of mango salsa. At best, this was an average dish. There's just something about these tacos that's missing. The taste of the short ribs is decent and the dressing added another layer of flavor, but the tacos just didn't wow me."}
{"text":"OMG if I could give 6 stars I would, my experience there was so wonderful!  My wifey and I went here for our early xmas dinner, we both have wanted to try it and I was told that 80% was gluten free. Score! I'm in. My friend actually knows one of the chef's that helped open the restaurant, so that made things even more awesome.   I said I was a celiac, and the server took the menu, went to the chicken and asked the chefs which was which and came back with the items I could have circled. Makes life a lot easier for me and you.   We had the scallops ceviche, calamari, chicken tacos, the potato chips and there was one more I totally can't remember. Sadly none of the desserts are gluten free, but our friend offered to make me something special next time I come in. Which I'm looking forward to.   The food was delicious, everything was cooked well, the tastes were paired perfectly and the best part it wasn't insanely expensive. For 5 tapas and 2 glasses of champagne, our bill was $70. Which isn't bad for a nice dinner. Very nicely decorated and the actual best part, they have their own parking lot, in Mission. Glorious!"}
{"text":"I moved from the Mission area in November, but many times walked by this place. From the street, it always looked dark ( during the day) and quite frankly I had my doubts that this place like many restaurants may not last. Boy was I surprised when I recently went there for dinner.  We went for a friends bday celebration and had the private room located to right when you first walk in. First impression- Wow! The room had one large table and overhead was a collection of punched tin lanterns, and globes of varying sizes...elegant and stunning. The room itself was tasteful - only complaint is that the room was a bit bright - but that was a minor complaint.   Our server was fantastic! A young girl who was professional, poised and polished. She handled our large group so well.  As a vegetarian there were plenty of options from the menu. I ordered 2 items, the roasted beets and the zuccini (sp). Both were delicious. Everything else that the others ordered were also exceptional.  A standout was the broccolini in candied ginger. The server said think of it as broccoli in a donut. She was right -bizarre as it sounds, it was delicious - we all couldnt get over how amazing it was.   I wandered through the other side of the restaurant to use the washroom, and was impressed at how beautiful it was. Considerably darker- with a strong morrocan vibe. Relaxed and warm.   All in all, this restaurant was wonderful. We had a great night. We will be back."}
{"text":"So hard to score Candela this low because the place is stunning. Every time I've been there I want the decor for my home. The wine list is excellent, cocktails are Delish and the tapas are pretty close to perfect. But it falls down on service every time (except when I have sat at the bar on occasion as I book used to business meetings here frequently). One time the waitress hit on my married colleague to the point were we paid up early and left so haven't held a meeting there since.  Other times they have been scattered and not attentive or good at directing with the menu like how many plates to order etc. Last night was the same. My friend picked it for her belated bday dinner, when she arrived they told her I wasn't there but she saw me otherwise they had sent her away.  the waitress took 20 min to get her drink to her and then said she would be back to take our order. Another 15 mins go by before we see her. We order some plates and ask if that's an appropriate amount of food and feedback on the best tuna plate in servers opinion. It was 'up to you' was her response so we said we would start with the 3 plates we ordered.  Never saw her again until we had been waiting with empty drinks and dishes for at least 15 min. We paid our bill of $90 and went and finished dinner somewhere else. It really is about the people....."}
{"text":"I love a place that has a playful name, especially one that rhymes with a great world leader, played by Morgan Freeman. Say, did you know he almost died the other week?  *creepy whisper* \"CAAAAAAANDEEEEELLAAAAA\"  And so carries the conversation when you're sitting with a finely mixed cocktail in your hand. When you're friend(s) also have an equally great mix in their hands, they make even better listeners.  I strolled in here hoping to make a cheap cameo on Danelle's yyceats, I was training and was looking to only try a cocktail. But instead I ended up trying three of their amazing beverages. Each were fairly priced but I almost felt bad for getting LIT because folks...  Men (and women) drink for taste, getting drunk off great cocktails is for teenagers  Also this is what I get for skiping their tappas, they looked like they tasted AMAZING. I'd love to come back.But the three drinks I got were: La Amante (tequila came through quite nicely), eden (girly drink but the kalamansi was lovely, ahem), and side car (BOSS LEVEL).  -1 star for relegating our table from their private room because we didn't seem to have enough people attending. Listen, WE CLASSY CANDELA, now you let us discuss economics, judo, etc...  Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012 - 2/30"}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant.  Had a late lunch or early dinner, on Dec.30.  I typically like being in a restaurant with people, adds to the atmosphere, but we were the only ones there as they just opened.  It was super fun.  They paced us well, cocktails and mocktails were great.  I love the tapas style that Calgary is embracing and this restaurants leads the way so far.  The fried stuffed olives are a must.  Also the Paella is flavorful and unique in their serving style.  Blood Orange Daiquiri is wicked.  Finish with the bunuelos, if you don't like them, you shouldn't be allowed to eat."}
{"text":"Met up with a girlfriend here the other night for a bite & a chat.  Candela has been on my radar for awhile and I was very happy to be able to finally check it out.  We made reservations so no problem getting a table.  Since my gf was running late I decided to have a cocktail and went with the Rhubarb Mojito.  Since I grew up eating Rhubarb by the truck load (my mom grew it) and I love Mojito's...it sounded like the perfect pairing.  And it was.    While I was waiting I took some time to visually take in the lounge.  I loved the decor..rather Moroccon-esque with an old style feel.  The lounge is cozy but extremely loud and as such not somewhere I would want to bring a date (unless you wanted loud lol).  The bathrooms thrilled me.  Typically restaurant bathroom stalls are smallish..so small at times the door touches the toilet and you end up doing yoga moves to try and figure how to get in and out.  Here you have at least 4 feet between the toilet and the door and no I'm not kidding.  This is a real treat and will make those with claustrophobia happy.  My girlfriend arrived, we ordered some wine and got right to business.  So much to choose from made it challenging (we wanted to try everything) but we decided on 4 tapas to start: Calamari, Crispy Chicken Lollipops, Shrimp taco, and the Beets.  The chicken lollipops were my least favourite and I wish there had been more shrimp in the tacos but everything had superb flavour and the Calamari was outstanding.  Feeling full we still wanted to try more so we ordered the Tomato Salad and finished the evening with the Chili Chocolate Pot Du Creme.  The salad was simple & tasty and while I adored the pot du creme (love chocolate & spice), I wish they would have strained the chili seeds and chili pieces out as I really didn't enjoy chewing on them while eating my dessert.  We really did enjoy our experience here and will most definitely return to try some more of their yummy goodness in all it's variations."}
{"text":"Mmm... Candela. Easily one of my favourite restaurants to open in the last year.  This is good for shared meals - best to order a few small plates for the table and eat a little of each.  The servers are knowledgeable and open to adjustments (like modifying for my dairy allergy).  The space is nice, quite trendy.  The bar space, with no reservations, seems to fill up pretty steadily between about 5 and 7, and then empty again (people stopping for a drink on the walk home?).  They also have a private room, maybe enough for 15 people or so?  I've never used it, not sure if there's an extra charge or minimum, but it looks nice!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!!! I'd been dying to try Candela, so on Friday the opportunity presented itself so my mom and I headed over for lunch. It was a little hard to find at first, as I found the exterior to reflect an \"older\" image, and much different from the inside. Very elegant decor, I almost felt like I was in an upscale hotel bar or something, although I'm sure the ambiance is a bit different in the evening. We were seated immediately and our server explained their tapas-style menu, and we went to town! We ordered the Tuna Ceviche, Shrimp Tacos, Roasted Fennel, Shrimp Tacos, Calamari, and the Braised Short Rib. Everything was absolute perfection and expertly timed, and the dishes were bite sized so we didn't fill up too quickly. Candela is a great place to have a business meeting, lunch with friends, or a romantic dinner with your lovah. I personally love the sharing style of the menu, so it was great, because I prefer to graze and take my time, while relaxing and having drinks. The stand out for me was definitely the Tuna Ceviche and the Calamari! It truly was some of the best calamari I've ever tasted. So delicious. Cant wait to go back and try more of what Candela has to offer."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We had 3 tapas each and every one was amazing - I think my favourite was the Tuna ceviche, but each dish was a delicious surprise!  The space is open and comfortable with a beautiful central bar.  It is a great environment for sharing food, drinks and conversation.  I love tasting a variety of dishes, and this space is perfect for that!"}
{"text":"This is an adorable little lounge that seems actually quite hidden! The bartenders were great recommending and curating fantastic drinks for my co-worker and I and the food they served was very different. They combine spicy and sweet together for many of their dishes and it's absolutely fantastic!   The lounge area is quite large and I love sitting there and watching the bartenders make drinks. The dishes are generally for sharing there are small plates and big plates so definitely something for everyone.  The decor was very much that of modern art. Some of the pictures I feel like I didn't understand but at the same time they definitely added a nice touch. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Review #2 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  Oh baby... I like your style. Unfinished Moroccan tiles, dark red velvet bench seating, and an all round chill retro-ish vibe, Candela's one of those places that make me wanna go \"Mmmm...\" The first time I walked into Candela, I felt like I had entered the lounge of the most chill hotel in town. Candela's got style. In fact, it may have a little TOO much style for the city. What am I saying!?! Impossible.   My favourite time to hit Candela is mid-afternoon. Like, 2-5pm... the designated happy hour. If you're looking for your next business meeting location, skip the coffee shop and come here.   Once you're here, you'll want to order one of the following:  Drinks: Cherry Sour La Amante Rhubarb Mojito  Food: Tuna ceviche Bok choy Tunisian carrot hummus Short rib Flank steak  I'm sure I'll be adding to that list soon... but for now, these are what have stood for me. Especially the tuna ceviche. Nom nom nom.  Also of note, the private dining room. It's the only spot you can make a reso for and ideal for 10 or a few more guests. You can see right into the kitchen from there as well. Otherwise, if you want in, you'll have to get there early (I mentioned happy hour, right?) or try your luck."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but a bit pricey.  $$ on yelp shouldn't equal an $80 tab for 2 with no alcohol."}
{"text":"It was the Big Taste a few weeks ago but unfortunately I don't have the kind of income to really take advantage of all the unique restaurants participating in the event. Fortunately, my lady friend Chloe P. is the bread-winner and showed me a bit of pity by treating me to dinner at Candela. Cool! Food always tastes better when someone else pays especially when they're as attractive as she is!  Let's talk about the restaurant first. For starters, they have their own parking lot which is a huge deal because parking on 4th is a monumental pain in the ass on weekends. The actual building itself used to be a sandwich shop but they did a good job of dressing it up and making it swanky as hell! I particularly liked the massive bar in the center of the room that is directly under a massive skylight. The libations were tasty and pricing was at par with every other ultra-fancy lounge in the city. Overall, I found the space to be rather intimate and not too noisy and I would rate it as a good spot for a date or a relaxing dinner with family and friends.  On to the food. As I stated, we were here for the Big Taste so the menu was pre-set. I actually went in without a clue as to what we were in for so it was all a surprise for me. The Big Taste menu was a four course meal. First course was calamari and a light salmon crudo. Second course was chicken tacos and a beet salad. Third course was the braised veal and the papas fritas. The final dessert course was the bunuelos which are like tiny round donuts with a dulce de leche sauce (oh damn, my favorite). By the end of the meal we were left wanting more. Not more food though because we were stuffed but more flavor! Don't get me wrong, all the food was good and you can taste what they were trying to do but it all tasted a little too safe for me. Throughout the evening I was thinking \"this would have been orgasm inducing if it had a little more of this....\". Take the calamari for example; if I was able to taste a little more sweetness from the toasted coconut it would have been the most unique calamari I might have ever had!  Candela is pretty good, overall. They probably would have gotten more stars from me if I didn't go for the Big Taste Menu items and ordered for myself because truthfully I wouldn't have ordered any of the items served to me if I had my own choice. I'll definitely give Candela another shot in the future and I expect to modify my review favorably. Next time I'll set my targets on the scallop ceviche, pork tenderloin yakitori, chicken liver and the eggplant"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check out Candela! I love the ambience in there and think its a great place for drinks. Has an upscale feel, but does not seem pretentious. Definitely more of a mature crowd, which is what I prefer anyways. A place like that wouldn't be the same if there were tons of raging teenagers.   We arrived a little early for our reservation, which gave us a chance to order some drinks at the bar. The selection was pretty good and I love places that have unique beers. It wasn't too long before our table was ready. I was a little turned off by the fact that the hostess expected us to carry our own drinks to our table as she just pointed us in the direction to where our table was. So with both our waters and drinks in tow....we found our table and despite the lack of \"hostessing\", we were excited to eat. The food for the most part was good, however I did feel like every dish had me longing for that burst of flavor. I was not at all unsatisfied, but I did want something more. The chicken tacos however, were awesome! The chutney was delicious and was exactly what I was looking for. Despite where it fell short, i will be back to give Candela another shot."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my fiancé and another couple. We started with sangria (2 white and 1 red) which took soooooo long to come out. Probably about 20 mins. The waitress apologized and said they take long to make. Wasn't impressed. The white was way too sweet. We started with the Meat and cheese board ($25) the board is really big but not that much on it. Most of it is taken up by toasted bread. Tasted good but should def be a bigger portion of $25. We also had the tomato & buffalo mozzarella ($19) again these two starters are listed under their \"large portions\" but they were both medium sized at best. We also had:  2 beet salads $10 each (only thing that was a decent portion) Kale salad $12 Calamari $12 Crispy chicken lollipops $9 Seared scallops $16 (4 tiny pieces in a small bowl) Lamb meatballs $11 (4 meatballs in a small bowl) Manchego brûlée $8 Bunuelos $8 (I think that's the whole list)  Overall we were still hungry after all of this. The place is expensive for the small portions you get. Totally understand its tapas but not worth it. Everything should prob be a few $ each to make sense. We also had a ton of wine/mixed drinks too. Bill was almost $300 at the end.  Better places to go downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites restaurants in Calgary!!!.. Everything here is AWESOME!!.. I haven't tried one thing I do not love!!.. All the tapas are delicious..and the best thing is you can try different things and they have the perfect size to enjoy it without been stuffed... In addition, the wine is incredible!!.. And the service is very good too.. The place is very beautiful and the prices have the perfect value for the quality of the food.. If I could I would go there everyday... Love this place!!"}
{"text":"An offshoot of Alloy, Candela has a beautiful vintage decor with an interesting colour palette.  We went there for a late afternoon lunch and had the place almost to ourselves.    I loved the large bar in the center of the restaurant, and the vintage leather couches.  The tapas are delicious and complex.  I absolutely loved the ahi tuna sashimi with watermelon - such an amazing combination of flavours.    We will definitely be coming back."}
