{"text":"Best breakfast sammie. Just sayin'. Huge eggs and cheese portions. Everything else I've tried is also really good, and I'm not just saying that. I can't really pick out a favorite (other than the breakfast sandwich, because I'm a breakfast-o-holic) Every day of the week they have a special.  Joe was one of the most giving and friendly proprietors that I've ever met, he always recognized me when I came in, and asked me where I'd been if I hadn't come in in a while. I'm quite sad that he retired.   Great service and great food, this little sandwich place gets 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Love this local deli, this is my go to place to pick up a quick lunch.  Staff is super friendly and i love their donairs there as that is what i always get-Pita filled with sliced beef, onions, lettice and tomatoes with sweet sauce. The have daily specials and premade sandwiches available if you are in a rush.  Lunch time can get really busy so recommend coming here before noon."}
{"text":"Really cheap quality - felt sick for the rest if the day after eating there i was disappointed"}
{"text":"the best! my office is right down the street and Joe's is perfect for hangover breakfast sandwiches, comfort food lunches, or nice healthy salads! they've got it all, and service is always a dream!  They're pretty hidden by all the construction stuff still, but take a good look and you'll find them! *Important Edit* Coworker had the bibimbap special yesterday, and claims it was mind blowing. I didn't try it, but it looked/smelled amazing! i will get it next Thursday as it's the Thursday special. (today is friday which is pulled pork, fyi)"}
