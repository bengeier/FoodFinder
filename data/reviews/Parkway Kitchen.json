{"text":"Very friendly and tasty. But the prices are more expensive when compare to other similar food court Chinese fast food. It's good but guess won't visit again."}
{"text":"I have been around most of the good Chinese restaurants within Greater Toronto Area, and this place is simply amazing. It has become my favourite stop for take out authentic Chinese food over the years. Prices are very reasonable, and the owners are always friendly. There is a reason they have been in business for over 20 years."}
{"text":"For those who dont like reading everything...: - If you need chinese take out, come here if you are around.  Best place to go to for it.   - If you want a large order of friend chicken for house party or what not, come here.  Really good, and great prices  For the readers: I've been here many times, for many years, and the food has always been good.  The lady has always given people good service, despite she always sounds like shes yelling at you, but its actually just her talking voice.  The fried chicken here is amazing, and absolutely great for small dinner parties.  I come here all the time for it.  If you can, call in the night before you want a big dish of chicken, as they only prepare a small number of them for the day.    The other good thing is that due to the un-used and rather clean eating area, theres like 50 tables thats always unused.  If you need a nice quiet place to eat quickly and go, this is a good place for it.    I come here for takeouts for family stuff,, friends, and office parties and was never once disappointed."}
{"text":"Situated in a depressing little chinese mall connected to the sheraton hotel is the only busy establishment in the food court. The lady is hard working and is very accommodating. Prices are beyond reasonable and value is unbeatable in this area. Food is made fresh to order. It's the busiest place here for a reason!"}
{"text":"Food is great , price is good , great customer service , perfect for quick lunch or dinner , definitely suggest it ;)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Very no frills but fresh, reliable and great tasting food!  For regulars, I recommend purchasing their discount card for $13.  It will save you 13% on all future orders, plus, they throw in a 1/2 fried chicken for buying the card....so you can't lose!  All orders are cooked to order, so nothing you order is sitting in a heat tray.  Try it.....you might like it!"}
{"text":"Great consistent hole in the wall take out place that caters to the busy bodies that want a quick bit to a full family meal at very affordable price.  All meals come with a drink (Chinese soup of the day, soy milk or bottle of water).  Very consistent with their quality and also goto them for party orders as their fried chicken is a big hit with the young and old."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for fried chicken lovers. I personally think it taste better than KFC or Popeyes and the pieces are much bigger. Their rice and noodles are also pretty good too."}
{"text":"Located in the foodcourt of the Parkway Mall, Parkway kitchen has a variety of Chinese food available to choose from. Prices are cheap and portion sizes are large. Only downside is there is usually always a long line around lunch time since the Rhill office building is located right next door. Other than that it's a good place to go to!"}
