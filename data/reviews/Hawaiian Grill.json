{"text":"Fried rice and grilled chicken is amazing!!! Best I've ever had!!! They have good prices for lunch. I like having this option in the food court because it's different and is nice having something other than the normal options in a mall.  Tip: Ask for extra sauce for the grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Food courts, Food courts, Food courts.....I really hate mall food courts!   People cutting in line,  Mom with strollers running you down, and food choices from the best fast food marketers in the country.   It's almost laughable to think of lunch on the weekend at one of them, but I found one (actually two inside of this food court) that makes me happy.  Tucked away between Hot dog on stick, and Dairy Queen is lies a little known cafeteria style eatery known as Hawaiian Barbeque.     No, they don't make any Loco Moco or Teriyaki steak, but they turn out a rather interesting selection of chicken dishes.    For their name sake, they make a pretty good huihui chicken (which is a char broiled hawaiian style chicken), but it's their spicy chicken which is their specialty.    The owner is from Korea, and this dish has a heavy influence from her home country.   This chicken is fried. and has a sweeter taste to it.    The employees are usually giving samples of this chicken to anyone passing by their location.   Looking at the selection on side choice, they have a few of them for the western palate.    Rice, Mashed Potatoes, mixed vegatables, buttered corn, toss salad, and of course Macaroni salad.   For the Hawaiian inside of us, they make a spam musubi.  Prices for plates start at 4.99, which is a pretty good deal for a food court."}
{"text":"Good Food and really friendly people!  What really roped me in was the free samples they liberally give out.  I settled on their Hawaiian Chicken and Steamed rice.  I'm a simple guy and this pretty much was what Panda Express was (I HATE PANDA EXPRESS) but their food was 20x better.  Their mac salad was delicious as well.  The wife had their noodles and garlic chicken.  Their prices are reasonable.  I would've expected it to be a bit more expensive because it was at a mall.  A very good option at the Galleria Mall Food Court.  Will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I like Hawaiian Grill just fine.  It's not exactly gourmet or anything, but it sure beats Panda Express.  The chicken is always tender.  I like that they have vegetable options (despite the nature of my reviews, I AM pretty health-conscious).  Eh, it's mall food.  It's probably the best option at the Galleria."}
{"text":"Love the Garlic Chicken, and the macaroni salad is awesome! Just the way i like with choke mayonaise."}
