{"text":"My first time going to Long Wong, as my daughter suggested the place for wings and we usually go to wing stop, but they are more pricy.  So I take her suggestion to go to Long Wongs and that was a horrible experience, they re-cook the wings that they make in the morning or partially cook and then dump them in deep fryer a second time, they were really bad.  Then we decide to order chili cheese fries and they were worse than the chicken, I would not give that to my dog that is how nasty it was. We ask the girl in the front to please change it, she tells us we have to charge you 2 additional dollars to change it for something else...seriously.  I do not recommend this place unless you like nasty re-cooked wings and nasty chili cheese fries and horrible customer service.  I will never go again ..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 6-7 times.
On a few occasions they can be reasonable.
But far too often the wings taste like left overs which were microwaved from the previous day.
Quality is not important to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 dozen wings  there and they were all flats no drummets. Called and they said it just happens, that is what got delivered. I don't believe that. People before us probably ordered all drummets and we got the left over stuff. I dont know about anyone else. But I like some drummets as well. Ordered there at least 7 times have never just gotten all flats or all drummets. Won't go there any more and will tell others not to all."}
{"text":"My children love the wings here. Customer service is great. Wings are in my opinion better then a Wing Stop."}
{"text":"Went in to order something they show on their online menu only to have them tell me that they no longer make that item. Hmmmmm. Not impressed on previous visits either. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The best Wongs I've ever had. Always fresh. The fries are never old and the Honey Hot Wings are always sauced evenly. Not too little not too much. Get the $8.25 Value meal. 8 wings and a drink."}
{"text":"Great small family business always experience great service and great food. Wings are the best but they also have a lot of other options that are just as good!  Support the small businesses in our area!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten better since they opened. Wings and burgers are the two goto things I get from here. Phone orders are quick, and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"The wings are cooked to perfection! I love the taste of the spicy ranch and the fact that they give you celery and carrots is a big plus !"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been standing strong for four years. Each time we've come, it's always been pleasant with amazing hospitality. The food is always quick, perfect and always greeted with a smile. Thank you Rubina. We appreciate your continued superb service."}
{"text":"PLEASE DO NOT go to the LONG WONGS on 35th Ave and Southern. Ordered wings and tasted like BLEACH. I tried to have them replaced and they told me because I complained after 4 hours that they could not replace my food. Givin this was around  2 30.  I got home and my family was done eating so I ate around 330. I ate 2 and decided that I was not going to eat anymore because of the taste. So I started homework with my son which takes forever. I finally called at 630 and this is what I was told.
I had ordered 50 wings and pizza for my family and guest. About 30 wings were left. We have about 8 extra people eating from out of town. So if they grab maybe 2 wings each. Who's to say they did not taste the same thing. Which I got home after everyone left so I did not get a chance to ask how the food was. So I only complained about the 20 hot wings that left not the other wings that were medium. Per management... So I guess they lost my business."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I don't have to drive from 51st down to central anymore.  I love their wings and I'm not a \"wing eater.\"  My husband and I went there 2-3 days after they opened their doors and the staff was very friendly just like they are now.  I have a large extended family and we've tried just about everything on the menu - wings, zucchini, french fries, chicken strips, pizza, and probably other items.  The point is my family enjoyed their meals very much."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but the customer service is nothing short of tragic. I ordered the fish fry which is 3 pieces of fish and fries, what I got was one price of fish and some small nuggets.  The manager told me that's is just how the fish was cut. This happened twice and now I've decided they don't deserve my business."}
{"text":"NEVER order from this Long Wongs...I ordered my usual  (lemon pepper) when I called the to tell them the wings were to salty they have a no money back policy.  I asked if they could replace them I was told no and he was the manger.. football season is coming up and we have a party everyweek. Pizza wings Sub and wings..Not from Long wongs"}
{"text":"Sorry to say but the quality has gone down. The pizza dough tasted roughly like cardboard, the side salads were pretty good except the watered down ranch and few wilted pieces of lettuce.  Just sucks that especially the pizza has gone down. It's like they bought generic frozen cheese pizza and just add whatever toppings the customer orders. Probably won't be going back until reviews show it's gotten better"}
{"text":"Food always tastes great every time I come! Ordered 12 bone-in medium hot wings and an order of potato skins! 

Employee brought the food to our table. Staff is always very nice. 

Shared parking lot, but not a problem finding a space!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't that good to be honest. The burger bun was soggy, plus the burger wasn't that good"}
{"text":"So, we went online to order.  Got our order in, credit card charged and went to pick up order 40 min later.  We get there, said they could not 'find' our order!  And to make things worse they could not refund credit card because a place called Eat 24 takes their payments.  Will NEVER and I mean NEVER GO BACK there again.  Then we heard someone in the kitchen say ALL online orders had been cancelled because they were 'TO BUSY'!  There is another Long Wongs on Baseline and Central...they have great wings so will just use them from now on. Too bad, you lost our business and alot of other really pi..ed off people today.  Same thing happened to them too!  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go in the entire world. Staff is super friendly and the place is pretty clean compared to other locations. Me and my boyfriend always come in and get 2 dozen wings every time. I LOVE the garlic parm. Wings and he loves honey hot. If i could eat 1 thjng every day it would be these wings. Much better than buffalo wild wings and great prices. I will definitly continue to be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Not even the food, but the employees. Considered going there, I went there before a few times and had wings. The wings are pretty good, pizza is rather bad. Got out of my car and right at that moment, two of the employees stormed out of the restaurant and started yelling across the parking lot at some customers that just left 'f...ing b..ch' a few times... My six year old daughter learned a few new cuss words...great! Very trashy, definetely won't go there!"}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible.  Will not return.  Cashier made us drive home for a coupon that was only a difference of $0.94. Pizza was burnt and not cut right.  I recommend finding a different pizza place and not waste your money here!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great...but sadly that was the only thing...the place looks a bit run down...which is way out of place for the area...the wings were a bit over cooked...they were sauced with tasty sauce (so 2 good things)...and then the pizza...looked terrible...taste terrible...it appeared to be a preformed crust with canned sauce and cheap cheese...I used to eat at the long wongs on 75th all the time...they have either gone downhill big time...or I used to enjoy dreadful food"}
{"text":"The food here seems like it is pre-cooked.  Always dry or overcooked.  Maybe even microwaved???  Wings are awful.  They cook way too many in advance.  Hot dogs are always burnt and over done.  I asked the cashier if their onions rings were home made.  She said she did not know what that meant.  I told her it meant they peeled, cut them and battered them in the restaurant and deep fried them.  She stated yeah, we cook them here so yes they are home made.  No IDIOT, that is not home made.  Food seems to run well when management is there but when the cat is away the mice really do not give rat's ass about the food or the customers."}
{"text":"Hated it!!!...wish they had ratings of negative...this place sucks....was told not to go there but thght it would be ok for wings...they literally tried to kill me!!!
And they would not refund my money or redo my order.  Very poor customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw this place was opening because its closer than Marcia's Long Wongs which is where my family and I usually go. I put in our usual order and was very disappointed! Everything thing tasted \"soggy\". The wings were not very good and the fries were soft, soggy and not very good at all. I'm not giving them a 3 star or higher because I think they have a lot of improving to do."}
{"text":"Ahhhh food so good! But it takes forever to cook it! But Atleast I know it's not being microwaved and served in 3min. So it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I mean it's a pizza joint; after reading some of the reviews I am keeping in mind it's a classic pizza spot. That being said I like it, the food has flavor.  It's always hot, and I be never experienced a super long wait. The counter girl is so awesome; we have a large family and she always makes sure we get the most bang for our buck. give it a Philly thumbs up! 

Disclaimer: I don't know how respected my Philly thumbs up is in the Desert but I still like them!"}
{"text":"Ordered value combo 8 wings cheese fries n drink with a side of 12 extra wings. All ordered well done...8 suicide 6 hot and 6 honey bbq. Everything super delish. Staff friendly. Even got extra ranch at no fee... many times here but most def eat in for best experience! No complaints will not give lesss stars for paint! Nfl on always a plus."}
{"text":"Don't let the menu fool you. Everything here tastes like cardboard except for their wings. The wings have to be the only reason any long wongs is still open. The wings are worth it. Everything else is a waste of money. I've tried their burgers and pizza. How do you even mess these up? They were B A D!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible, good luck ordering take out over the phone. They put you on hold when there's no one even in the restaurant"}
{"text":"I have been back a few times and haven't see that rude cashier I saw last time. For the most part, I'm happy with the people working there. They are usually very nice and efficient and I get my wings quickly and they are tasty. I also like the owner who is very friendly! I think having friendly employees with good customer service is important because customers want to be treated with respect."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now and both times the food was very good.  I had the steak sandwich,  my son had the patty melt and I have also tried one of their hot dogs before. The fries and the onion rings were both fresh and tasty. Maybe I just have gotten lucky,  but I have nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"First time visiting wongs .  Staff very friendly and food was fast.  They did everything we asked for ie well done wings and pizza.  Dining area/restrooms were clean but the dining area could use a coat of paint.  

Fries were good and a good price.  Wings did not have enough sauce and were way too greasy.  We asked for a side of sauce and staff were extremely friendly and accommodating then I realized the sauce was also oily...not my favorite sauce.  The pizza appeared well cooked but was very bland.  We won't be back but I have had way worse and I really wanted to like the food because the staff was excellent."}
{"text":"Ewwww there wings are soggy everytime my mother in law eats dad eats if it ain't got back to them since and I swear they have more greese then wing sauce...."}
{"text":"I have been to the Long Wong's in Central Phoenix (love it) so imagine my surprise when I saw one in my new town!  WOOOOOT!  Came here the day I moved into my house with my friend.  Immediately noticed that the prices for wings are about a dollar more per dozen then the Central PHX location but didn't mind.  We ordered, sat down, and in about 15 minutes had our food.  I was amazed to see that the size of the wings here was double the size of the other LW's.  So that's why they were a dollar more...
As always, the wings were awesome.  I always ask for mine well done so they're crispy, but they're definitely not soggy if you forget to ask.  They have about 10 sauces you can choose from and also have dry rubs like lemon pepper and just salt and pepper if that's more your style.  All orders come with carrots and ranch (you may sub blue cheese for no extra charge).  
I can't really comment on the service aspect of LW's since you order at the counter and they just bring you your food when it's ready, but the workers were pleasant and answered our questions happily.  This will definitely be a place I frequent now that I live in Laveen."}
{"text":"Great wings,sandwiches, pizzas and more!! They bring your food to you! Can't say that for any of the fast food spots!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! They have a special for wings, fries, and a drink. Quick service and always friendly! You can call ahead and place your order. Clean spot to get your wings fix."}
{"text":"The wings are cooked to perfection! The employees are very friendly and patient. I'm sorry I don't frequent here often, but I sure in the heck will try!"}
{"text":"My #1 wings, pizza, and fries spot in the city. I would highly recommend \"Long Wong's\" in Laveen, AZ.
Thanks Long Wong's!"}
{"text":"Got a grilled chicken salad from there and something in it smelled moldy and old. You can literally taste it. I called and asked if I could bring it back in and all they kept repeating is that they only use fresh ingredients and that they don't give refunds or make different orders. I even offered to bring the uneaten salad back to them so they could smell it themselves and the guy on the phone said it would do no good because they don't do refunds and will not make a replacement order. I then said \" So I am out of 8 bucks and I have a salad that's not edible.\" To which the guy responds. \" If that's how you want to look at it.\" That's literally the case ! I'm more upset over the terrible customer service and low moral when dealing with this situation. A little empathy goes a long way. It may not mean much but they have certainly lost me and my husbands business."}
{"text":"Worst place EVER!!! They messed up the order, gave us bone in wings instead of boneless that I ordered, they were extremely over cooked and uneatable!  Then when we called to tell them THEY messed up, the manager said there's nothing we can do for you!!!!! Wow!  Save your money and go to wing stop or natives!"}
{"text":"I order the double cheese burger comes with fries and some onion rings...very disappointed my fries and onion rings looked and taste so nasty I don't even think a homeless person would of ate it.......as seen in the picture they looked old and nasty the problem is not the onion rings or fries the problem is they never probably change the oil ...I think they use the same oil since the place opens cause I have never seen fries or onion rings look or taste that bad ....on the other hand the burger wasn't bad but the bad part my  lettuce was very old so if only the lettuce was good it would of been a good burger....burger rated 6 out of 10 .....services was very nice but plz change your fryer  oil out, and your ratings and customers will increase .."}
{"text":"This place is usually pretty good, but found a hair in my food tonight. Pretty disgusting"}
{"text":"Tried the 2 things most recommended by the girl who answered.

Pizza and some Pastrami sandwich.

The pizza was doughy and very bland and the sandwich was stuffed full of dy pastrami on what tasted like stale bread.

This is last resort food at its finest. I hear the wings are good, maybe thats the only thing worth getting."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings in Laveen it's is way better than churches,Popeyes,and wing stop. I love the honey hot wings and my husband loves the lemon pepper wings"}
{"text":"Great little spot with very nice staff. I had wings with medium sauce and a soda. Fast service that definitely didn't disappoint. I will be back for sure. Price was great too."}
