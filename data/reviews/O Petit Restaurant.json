{"text":"The worst food i ever had. The owner, feeling that i hated every bite i took, Didnt dare ask us how was the meal and looked at the floor as we walked out, never to return. ....Keep your money and make yourself a grilled cheese at home!"}
{"text":"Location: Off the beaten path. If you don't know the area, you won't know this place exists unless you're a local. Love it! Also, nice big parking lot available.  The place: Tucked away amidst trees and homes, this restaurant screams 'campagne' and I love it! Full-on wood construction inside and out, warm, subdued colors and lots of windows that encourage natural lighting, this place offers a homey feel and a relaxed environment. They have two floors and both are well laid out. There's plenty of space between you and your fellow diners.  Service: Pretty darn good. Our waitress was very friendly, and for whom this is important, perfectly bilingual. Truth be told, it's not really that hard to find English speakers in Morin Heights, as the majority of locals are Anglos.  That said, have no fear - they speak French too.  The goods: I only had breakfast and there's only so much one can say about eggs. I had two eggs with sausage - this came with coffee (and refills!), potatoes, toast and fruit. Everything on my plate was fresh and served piping hot. No complaints about any of it - it was all delicious. That includes the huge basket of crusty (toasted) bread. Yum!   Price point: Pretty reasonable - my breakfast cost $8.25 +tax.   These guys offer a pretty good variety of breakfast options, and are also open for lunch and dinner. I definitely plan to check them out again for lunch and dinner.  In a town where restaurants are literally non-existent, and where your only resto options are to head to the mostly over-priced St. Sauveur, O Petit is a fantastic, affordable option."}

{"text":"This is the most accommodating restaurant I have been to, absolutely no judgment was made due to my diet.  I had the Veggie Burger which consisted of a tofu scramble with spinach and chips on the side with a dairy and egg free coleslaw.  The burger was made without the egg as per waitress recommendation ~ Thank you!  It was the most delicious tofu I have ever eaten and the chips were the freshest cut potatoes with a savory flavor which made them irresistible to put down.  Our waitress was the a very pleasant woman who knew her food and made excellent recommendations, her service was outstanding and I would go back thanks to her."}
