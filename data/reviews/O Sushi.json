{"text":"Discovered this sushi place in our neighbourhood. Nice to have a local place we can walk to!

Atmosphere - small, Japanese decor (would make sense!) friendly staff and chefs. 

Food - really liked the rice that came with our bento boxes - not the typical white rice, presentation was lovely. Tempura appetizer was nicely battered and it came with egg plant tempura (i love egg plant!) Food was prepared fresh and tasted yummy!

Price - reasonable - not amazing deal like the restaurants on the Danforth, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"What a gem!!  I love the selection (even has takoyaki) and taste.  Also love that the combo hot dishes such as salmon teriyaki (one of my fav's) comes with red bean rice instead of just plain white rice. Really fresh fish, that even my very picky sister complimented on the freshness and loved her meal."}
{"text":"Leaps and bounds better than the average sushi takeout place. Sushi was very fresh and well executed. Portions are not huge, but I would rather quality over quantity anyways. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The staff here is always super polite and helpful. The food is always delicious and worth every penny! They know me by name at this point since I'm always there!"}
{"text":"I love sushi. i'm iranian but look sushi. if you want go to a good japonian resturant, i say that you go there.
tanx .
this resturant is near to my place. and sometimes i go there with my friends."}
{"text":"Finally! Coming from Halifax, it was hard to find a sushi place comparable to Sushi Nami on Spring Garden Road and on Lacewood drive.

This sushi spot is located off Coxwell and Queen St. E so it was easy coming from Coxwell station to take the 22 bus southbound.

Upon entering, I was greeted at the door by the chefs. They offer a welcoming environment.

I had the yammy yam tempura roll $7.95 and it came with 10 pcs.

It was fresh, warm, and delicious."}
{"text":"super friendly staff/that 2 employees only,lol, they do not have more/ but food isnt delicious the won ton soup was awful looked like vomit and tasted like that, they mixed everything into the miso base egg yolk and onion... it was cheap but ended up in the trash therefore waste of money.....they were very slow and we had no time waiting for main course so we left, and in the meantime i heard their neighbor came by complaining that the water is leaking and they did not care at all...poor guy...lol"}
{"text":"average food except for the rather tired-looking and vintage flavoured edamame and rather limp and worryingly flavorless ginger. Looks like they serve old food here. Also, table was sticky. Jazz music playing quietly - loved that. Nice server and cook."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I had sashimi dinner, but they half cocked the raw fish which it's unusually."}
{"text":"It was just ok, I wasn't wow like I thought I was. It is a cute place, but cramped isn't the feeling I want when sitting in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great value, all you can eat sushi - hand prepared and made to order."}
{"text":"Love this new sushi joint in Leslieville. The owners are young and smart. The service is excellent. The fish is fresh and portions are generous. And if you are adventurous try the Takoyaki (octopus balls) or the Okonomiyaki - phenomenal. They are not licensed yet but it's coming in the new year."}
{"text":"despite the typically slow delivery time we order from O Sushi once a week... they have some very creative rolls and a salmon donburri dinner that is our favourite!
definitely worth a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I just couldn't :( 

Like many other reviews mentioned, the owner/chef didn't want to honour the 10% off with yelp check in but I think even he felt a little bad about our experience that he did end up giving us a 3% discount. 

When he handed us the menu, he told us they were out of salmon. Ok, strange, it's Sunday night but it's fine? I can live without salmon. 

Here is what we ordered:
1) sunomono salad - 6.95
2) okonomiyaki - 8.95
3) spider roll - 10.95
4) chicken pan fried udon - 8.95

And the break down: 
1) when the sunomono salad arrived, he told us \"we're out of fish, is this okay?\" Uh... but you said earlier you were only out of salmon? But my boyfriend and I like the salad so um yeah it's fine. This was the third item we got and without seafood, it's (most definitely) pre-made cucumber salad on a plate so why did it take so long?? Also, I assumed in my mind that he wouldn't charge us the full price for it since... there was no seafood, but he did!! More on this later. 

2) okonomiyaki was.. okay. A lot of bonito flakes on top but the pancake itself was mushy and salty and made my boyfriend really thirsty after. Ingredients listed: shrimp, bacon, onion and cabbage. Lots of onion, decent amount of cabbage, tasted bacon in ~*only one*~ bite and no shrimp at all. Guess they ran out of shrimp also...?

3) spider roll ingredients listed: soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, tobiko. Yes cucumber, definitely no tobiko. I saw avocado but didn't really taste it. And for the highlight of this roll, the soft shell crab was crunchy in a stale way and also very small compared to the size of the roll. The roll wasn't rolled tight enough and fell apart every other piece. 

4) standard chicken pan fried udon, no complaints. 

As the other couple were paying, they sounded upset and asked why they didn't have any fish left. The owner/chef replied, \"I don't know\" 

When we got our bill, it came out to $36.8x. I asked him if I could use the yelp 10% off and he said \"we don't do that anymore.... but okay I can give it to you.\" I said he didn't have to (thinking maybe yelp hadn't updated or something?) but he said he'd take it off and our new total was $35. So yeah, 3% discount. I ended up giving him $40 and said he could keep the change which I'm now, unfortunately, regretting. 

I did the math when I got home and it seems like he added a 10% discount to our bill without telling us, but he charged us full price for everything despite none of it having the seafood it states to have. Total is 35.80 before tax and plus 3% (13% tax - 10% discount) comes out to 36.87. 

Am I upset? Yes. I'm really upset and I'm ESPECIALLY upset about the sunomono salad. Why did I get charged 6.95 for a little plate of cucumber salad? I can buy a whole plastic container full from Galleria for like 3.99!! I would've felt a biiiit better if he had charged it like a wakame salad instead (4.95) but noooope.

If they were only missing salmon, then I would be a lot more understanding, but it seems like that wasn't the case at all. If you're a restaurant and you're missing ingredients for most of the items on your menu, why are you open?? Why tell us you're only missing salmon when it's more than just salmon??? Did they bring the sunomono salad revealing they had no seafood half way through our meal so we couldn't leave?? I have so many unanswered angry questions. 

We were originally going to order take out (they're surprisingly well rated on just-eat) but no answer when we called and when I checked yelp for the hours, I saw the 10% off and was like let's go instead! R E G R E T. 

Everything about this experience was super scummy and I'm more upset about this than even the super dry chicken from Mymy. I will never, ever, ever, ever come here again :'("}
{"text":"Awesome Sushi - love the red dragon and spicy salmon.  They know how to make some great fresh maki.  We usually do take out since we live down the street.

Good prices and cash discount is always awesome!

Keep up the good work Osushi, we will be returning lots in the future!"}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery from O Sushi through justeat.com. I ordered a wakame salad and three different rolls. They are all much bigger than expected and really fresh. The delivery took a little longer than I would have thought (about an hour and I live about 4 blocks away) but I assume they are really busy. I will definitely go in to eat soon!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The service not so good. They sometimes only have one server, the lady never smiles and seems to be in  a bad mood always."}
{"text":"Now I haven't been to EVERY sushi place in Leslieville, but I feel like I can confidently say this little gem has to be among the best. This itty bitty sushi house made a big impression on my boyfriend and I, service was excellent, the sushi was even better! We had the salmon plate (6 sashimi, 6 sushi and 6 nagiri... all salmony), the Artic roll and the tempura. Definitely enough food for two people, although the quality of salmon was so excellent, I would have attempted to eat another plate of it. 

The restaurant can only seat about 15 people, and being so close to the theatre it was a great place for a movie date night dinner. Burger Priest used to have all my love on movie night, but O Sushi is now wooing my appetite! 

We will be back."}
{"text":"Decent sushi, but the delivery driver called my boyfriend an asshole for having an out of city area code."}
{"text":"O Sushi is a great addition to the neighborhood. The restaurant is small but the staff is always very welcoming and the service is prompt. Take out and delivery is available.  Very affordable and the food quality is excellent. Best sushi in the area! I have ordered take-out several times and it has been a good experience."}
{"text":"Wish I'd found this place sooner! The lunch was fast and fresh. Dynamite roll had freshly cooked tempura shrimp (unlike a lot of places that pre-cook them in batches and let them get cold). The service was good, and I'll be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great little neighbourhood sushi spot.  Service can be slow on a Friday night at prime time but the food is always fresh and very good. We are regulars on Friday nights and the wait staff remember our order and greet us well. Very friendly.  Well priced. I recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss.   Sushi is always fresh and a good choice, but no sashimi on the menu.   The beef ribs,  teriyaki,  katsu etc is luck of the draw, and is slow to come out.    
Service is weak at best.   Super slow, heavy attitude,  and didn't seem to want to be there.    She is the only waitress which adds to the frustration. 
No dessert for the AYCE ..... not cool when bringing little kids. 

For the price,  spoon and fork is best bang for your buck. 

If I return it well only be for the sushi"}
{"text":"Great sushi and I've been happy with everything I've tried there.  I often order the chirashi dinner and the rice is seasoned with something that makes it absolutely delicious!  My only complaint is that their delivery takes way too long.  If you don't want to wait an hour and a half or more for your food, I suggest going in to dine, or picking it up yourself."}
{"text":"O Sushi is my go-to for our (almost weekly) sushi treat.  Try the spicy Salomon- it's a must.
The sushi is extremely good and the chef is welcoming. It's not a place for a romantic dinner... and we live around the block- so it's a take out for us."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty rolls and fair pricing. We've added O Sushi as a dinner to our neighborhood favourites."}
{"text":"Good food... Sketchy place....intimate atmosphere... Very kind people!! Would come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Got takeaway from here tonight. Had the matsu sushi dinner, and they let me substitute a spicy tuna roll for the California roll without any issues.

It was amazing. Everything was fresh and delicious. I've struggled to find decent sushi since we've been in North America, but this really hit the spot. My lone complaint was that it seemed like the tuna in the spicy tuna had been battered and fried a little, which made it a little oily. And the spice seemed to come from the creamy sauce on top, and not the roll itself. But, having said that it was still really tasty and I would probably order it again.

So happy that it's nice and close to our apartment. No more crappy supermarket sushi for me!"}
{"text":"Fish was not fresh and sushi tasted horrible. Also the chef/ owner refused to go or the Yelp 10% off for check in and said it's only for pick up although the 10% off is for checking in! Anyway, if you're into sushi and sashimi you should stay away from this place :("}
{"text":"They totally failed to deliver an order. Just never showed up and then when I called an hour later to find out what the deal was, they kept saying it was on the way. 90 minutes later they finally admitted the order had never been prepared. 

Terrible delivery and take out service."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service, reasonable price and taste good :) ( I ordered green dragon and pink lady )"}
{"text":"The Call- Super friendly serivce
Delivery- Arrived within 1 hr as expected
Food- Meh. The spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon was all graded up together into  a spicy tuna and salmon x2. Should have taken a pic, but, didnt bother.  The Wakame Salad tasted a week old and wasnt even cool when I got it. The Gyoza was terrible, like they reheated frozen store bought gyoza. What we didnt finish I should have thrown out instead of putting in the fridge for later. 4 hours later I took out 1 bite...ate it and thought I was going to throw up and then was sick for a few hours.
Not recommended. Won't order again,"}
{"text":"Great sushi and very decent price. Delivery can take too long so we prefer to pick up."}
{"text":"Good prices. Fresh food. Very Small. 

There's only 4 tables here, and with small turn over, their kitchen is almost able to make everything fresh. Our dynamite roll ($8.95) , the tempura was still warm when we bit into it, but it did lack a little flavour. 

They have ramen here, making it the closest ramen place near work. ($8-9). The broth was fresh, no msg, and flavourful. I actually was drinking the soup. Noodles were not instant noodles. And there was lots of veggies and a hard boiled egg. 

Their lunch specials included the usual beef, salmon, bulgolgi, tofu, tempura boxes for about $8. Also some sashimi specials, but there wasn't a lot in the glass case. 

They were really friendly, and the service was a little slow, but they are making everything to order. The music was a  little loud. Nonetheless, we'll be back."}
{"text":"The place is good in a pinch, but I wouldn't expect anything over the top.  The rolls are somewhat fresh tasting, the meat dishes are very poorly done with the use of very low grade meats.  For a quick cheap lunch, it's OK..."}
{"text":"2 maybe 3 stars but minus 1 for not honoring yelp check in offer.

Salad  ...a bunch of lettuce and 3 slivers of red peppers. 

Gave me sushi with dried up Wasabi and no soya sauce...  I would have taken another star away if the hostess put in the salad dressing container she dropped on the floor on top of my (poor excuse) of a salad but she didn't.  I saw her think about it but she changed her mind at last minute.

Miso soup was just that. No tofu...no mushrooms... powder and water?

Teriyaki chicken and salmon was just ok....sauce was sweet and watered down.

If your gonna charge what you charge...  not honor what you advertise. .. then at least improve on the food quality/presentation."}
{"text":"Had delivery for the 33 piece party tray it was really good but the crab got me sick ... Split it with my gf and she doesn't eat crab that's how I figured it out .... Would have given 4 stars but couldn't for the amount of time I spent on the toilet"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Chicago US. We had great sushi rolls the Fire and Crazy roll. We also had the Salmon Sashimi platter. The fish was very fresh. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. My boyfriend and I make this our usual sushi joint. Always yummy, fresh and great a selection of options."}
{"text":"If you're into opening up a long-awaited delivery of anticipated sushi, putting the first piece in your watering mouth...

...and being horrified by the putrid taste and smell of spolied, rancid, warm raw fish in your gagging mouth, like I was on Friday, April 7, 2017...

...then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Great sushi however do not order it for delivery.  We decided to try this restaurant out last night for delivery and it took awhile to get the food, by the time we received it the dumplings and tempura was cold as ice. It was good sushi, but we will never order delivery again, we'll go eat in at the restaurant. The sushi rolls and eel were delicious."}
{"text":"Found this place because of Yelp. So good. Only has 4 tables but everything was awesome. I had 3 types of tuna sashimi. Fresh, tastes great and great service.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Visiting from Minneapolis. Friendly, fast service. Fresh sushi and sushimi. No complaints."}
{"text":"Not up to par at all. Too much rice in the maki rolls. Hot entrees were mediocre. 
Service was fast and friendly. Fish was fresh. But many better choices nearby."}
{"text":"One to keep and eye on. 
We just walked past this the other day, and decided to give it a try. 
I'd say Good, overall. I've had better and worse sushi in the neighborhood although it finds itself in a neat spot right between Leslieville and The Beach. . . . So it's unique in it's surroundings. Small dining area, seating for 10 or so.  Problem is, is that within a few blocks there are a lot of AYCE places, and a lot \"nicer\" Japanese restaurants. And Dollar for Dollar I'm not sure this is the best value in the 'hood? 
Service is super polite, and presentation is pleasing as well."}
{"text":"After a recent visit I discovered changes have  taken  place =(. The serving sizes are now smaller...the miso soup no longer has tofu in it ...the rice is just plan steamed rice and the salad dressing is gross bottled  Italian dressing What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Went here today for my son's 10th birthday cause he wanted sushi and since the weather is not so good we decided to eat close by. The food was great and fresh. Maki rolls were a little too heavy on the rice but still good. Only draw back was they didn't offer desserts for lunch which was a little peculiar compare to other all you can eat sushi restaurants that offers desserts. We gave this place another try and it didn't disappoint us. If you want fast service and fresh food go there when they just open for business, which is 11:30am...even the tea and soup are piping hot!"}
{"text":"Found this place while walking and walked by a few times. my boyfriend and I decided to try it and the place is a bit small only fits about 10 people or so but the service is great, very friendly and helpful. We ordered some sushi and a dinner plate. Food was great very fresh and well done. The plating was wonderful very nice and made me feel like I was at a fancy upscale restaurant. Pricing was fair for the amount of food we got. Very nice place and will be going back very soon"}
{"text":"There are several hundred dime-a-dozen Sushi joints in town.

This is NOT one of them.

I have to admit.  I was totally hesitant before eating.    It's in a non-descript area of town.   It only has four tables.  

But then you eat.

Incredibly fresh and flavorful fish.    Extremely well prepared.    Smiling service and excellent size portions.

Inexpensive and exactly what you want it to be."}
{"text":"Im always worried about sushi joints in Toronto as I have heard plenty of horror stories. This made me skeptical about O Sushi... Boy was I wrong! Probably the BEST and freshest sushi Ive ever had. Great service, the gent that took my take out order was super helpful and totally bent to my \"extra soya sauce and looottss of wasabi\" request while most places must think Im joking about how much I love wasabi. The salmon was super fresh and delish, gyoza amazing and service welcoming. Will deff be back for more!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on the yelp reviews. Probably the worst sushi I have ever eaten. Just got take away for dinner and ate it despite it not looking too great. Got the spicy California rolls and asparagus tempura rolls. The tempura asparagus was definitely not fresh. Then I noticed there was no crab in the California roll! What the!! Also the rolls were not wrapped tight and were difficult to eat.

My boyfriend picked it up so he called the place up and they told him they ran out of crab and \"forgot\" to mention it. No discount, no warning even. They said they'd give us a discount on our next order. With this being our first time ordering here, we definitely won't be back. Get your sushi elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Good sushi but not a very appealing restaurant. We ate at the location and there was dead bugs along the window ledge. Lots of them. And it didn't help that our table only inches away from the ledge."}
{"text":"The service is always great here. Lunch combos are well portioned and always filling. For $10.95 I suggest the Maki Mixed with miso soup and green salad. I love the salad dressing they use it's very delicious. The quality of the sushi is great, they use really delicious tasting salmon! I would recommend this place for lunch all the time. The avocado salad is also a very delicious option as an a la carte item. Great deal for the amount of food you get. I will definitely come back here. 5/5"}
{"text":"I just had one of the most satisfying meals of my trip to Toronto. I was visiting from Montreal where good sushi is hard to come by. The food here was fresh and delicious. The service was great. i will definitely come back here every time i'm in toronto."}
{"text":"Sushi is just ok. I've never seen this place busy and I find they always have trouble understanding what I want to order. I would go again out of convenience, still better than supermarket sushi."}
