{"text":"It is so refreshing to sit and enjoy coffee without worrying about keeping your child quietly occupied in their seat."}
{"text":"My favorite place to take my little ones and connect with other parents and their kids! I can drink a delicious lavender latte and eat a yummy treat (the chocolate chip cookies are sooo good) while my children enjoy some play time. We also enjoy reading books and watching the cars driving by in the window seat areas. Thank you for filling this void in our community!"}
{"text":"Had another good experience here but they did update their policy on outside foods. No outside food or drink allowed. Makes sense as there is no charge for the kids to play and you're really only paying for coffee and pastries."}
{"text":"Play Grounds is a great resource for parents and children to gather in a warm, friendly, and safe environment designed specifically for their needs and wants. The staff is kind and welcoming, the space clean and inviting, and the menu beautifully well-curated. They offer Phoenix coffee and a variety of fresh, local pastries. If you're a mom or dad of a little one looking for a place to have some relaxing fun as a family (while caffeinating yourself!), check out Play Grounds!"}
