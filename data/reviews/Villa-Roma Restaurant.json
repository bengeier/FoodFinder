{"text":"Pizza was ok. It is not the best, nothing special!! The location and the parking are not that great. The final input for this location is 3 starts because it is not that bad and it is not that great! There is more room for improvement. Best of luck to the customers and the owners."}

{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with Pepperoni and
Ham. The pizza had three very small piece of ham in the whole pizza. They were the size of one pepperoni combined. This
Place is a joke. They answer the phone with \"yeah\". No thank you or any customer service."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years, now twice this week.  If nothing else, they have a lady who makes homemade cakes.  Carrot cake is awesome and then there is a slice of Coconut cake..... job well done on that. 

 The sauce is okay, little on thin side but lasagna is tasty, spaghetti is perfectly cooked with flavorful meatballs.   Salad bar is tiny, however, items on bar does the trick.  This is why I came back, the salad is a must.  They have amazingly delicious chunky fresh bleu cheese dressing that deserves 5 stars.  Top with some crisp croutons and this whole meal is spot on.   Great local spot.  Oh, calzone with beef is like a cheeseburger in yummy crust of dough, fun change."}
{"text":"We ate there for lunch today and Villa Roma was very good. We both had the lunch lasagna and it was very tasty but the portions were small. I loved their little salad bar that come with all the lunch specials. Not much on it, but it has everything you need for a great salad. The homemade thousand island and blue cheese dressings were DELICIOUS! I am quite excited to try their pizzas and calzones! We saw a couple eating the calzones and they were huge and looked so good. It ain't Olive Garden but that's a good thing! I support local eats, not chain restaurants!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place!
Easy to find and plenty of parking available. The food is real New York style fare. Thin crust pizza, delicious sauce, and the best eggplant parmigiana I've had in years. Nobody makes eggplant better!  It's crispy on the outside and fully cooked and succulent on the inside. What a treat for a transplanted northerner. Maggie, our waitress, was a delight. Truly a \"service with a smile\" person. She was always at our table the moment we needed her. Thank you Villa-Roma for providing quality Italian food to our local area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. The pizza is always amazing, the service is great, and the coconut cake is absolutely to die for! I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Ok folks this is the best food in Gastonia. Salad bar-fresh greens, plenty of choices-comes with dinner. Lasagna was sooo tasty. Been to 5 others establishments in Gastonia, but this tops them all. The garlic bread melts in your mouth. Food came out quickly. Servers were really nice & attentive. Getting fried chicken parmigiana to go.  Will let you know how it is."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant.  Server Maggie couldn't have been nicer.  Food was great.   Prices were terrific.  Wine was Ok but for $5 a glass not complaining.   Spaghetti with shrimp in white wine sauce was good but very garlicky so be forewarned.  Would rather have had four large shrimp than a dozen smallish shrimp but still OK. Adequate salad bar.   On the whole very enjoyable dinner.  We will come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food in Gastonia. Menu is great and prices are as well. I'd recommend the mini pizza with three toppings- and going in for lunch. I had eggplant parmigiana along with bread and a salad. The eggplant was fantastic along with the homemade ranch dressing. I'll be back."}
