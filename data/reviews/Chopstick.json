{"text":"My experience regarding delivery is terrible. i've never been to this restaurant to dine in and now will never go. I will also never order from this place again. I have called this restaurant in the past and normally the food is good and the service is good. Since my last delivery which occurred last night Sunday March 1, 2015 at 7:42pm. I placed a order on Eat24. After waiting for my order until about 8:54 I gave the restaurant a  call. A lady answered and I provided my name and address and asked her how much longer the food would take. She placed me on hold and begin taking orders with other customers. I could hear every phone conversation she had with another customer, because i guess in reality she sat the phone on the counter, without actually hitting a hold button. She returned to the phone and before i could believe it she had placed me on hold again. I hung up at this point. At 9:20pm I received a knock at my door. I jumped up and go to the door because i am starving. I had already prepaid my order and left a 20% tip via Eat24, so i assumed getting my food from the driver would be a seamless process.
When I answered the door, There was a young boy standing in front of me. He was explaining how he had been outside for 30mins and he was mad that I did not answer my phone. I was in complete shock. I never received a phone call from him. And every time I had ordered from this place in the past, they never had a problem finding my address. After I signed the order the boy slung the bag at me and walked off. At this point I was furious. However I work in hospitality and I understood the actions of the drivers may not have been those of the business. I called the restaurant back not to get a full refund, but to get my 20% tip back. The 20% tip was only $3.74, however it was the principle. I did not think the driver earned a tip. 
When the lady answered the phone I explained to her what happened. Before I could finish she sat the phone down and I could hear her talking again. She picked the phone back up and explained to me how the driver said he was outside for 30mins. At this point I was very mad. I mean now she is arguing with my complaint. I never received a call from him. I had only asked her for the tip back before she called the driver.  Now I wanted the full amount I had paid. The lady started yelling at me saying the driver was there, why do you want your money back. But she did not realize the food was freezing cold. After finally not taking no for an answer I explained to the lady that she needed to refund my money. As a repeat customer this service was absolutely unacceptable. She finally stated that she would give me my money back and so I asked for her name. That is when she hung up on me. So I called back and asked her for her name and she hung up on me again. I called back and the line was \"busy\", so I kept calling back until I got her on the phone. She finally answered the phone again and I said what is your name. She said Ling and hung up."}
{"text":"Been ordering from here for over a year now. It's hit or miss 50/50 chance of it being good. I'm assuming they have one cook who knows what he doing. The rest of them  just throw things in a pan. I have gotten the same mix of veggies for dishes that don't even call for it. On top of that they were basically all same.. Lol what's the point of having options when they all taste the same. Thanks for this dry beef mein that I had to doctor myself to even want to eat it.. Tasteless need to get a grip on your cooks!!!!"}
{"text":"Best shrimp egg roll I never had! The house special fried rice was very good. Moist and full of flavor. The chicken wings were crispy and not geassy at all...look forward too trying more of their food."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery kind of late on a monday night, about 7 pm. It took 45 minutes but maybe they were just busy. The delivery guy was super nice and the food was amazing! I had the honey chicken and my sister had chicken and broccoli. I have had chinese food in many cities and this is really good. They also have very good crab rangoon, it is made the right way! My 1 yr old son loved it too!"}
{"text":"The good: They bring Chinese food to your house. The food isn't anything special, but like I said: it's Chinese food and you don't have to leave your couch. The delivery guy is also very nice. 

The bad:  The fried rice tastes like monkey butt. It is obvious they need to change the oil used in making the rice. Wait times can also be long, and the quality of the food can be inconsistent. 

The ugly: There's really no better place to get Chinese food delivered in SE CLT...shame on you Charlotte."}
{"text":"I feel like the food is getting better now and i think they said that the restaurant is under new management. I got kung paw chicken, sesame chicken and hot&sour soup. They all really good tho. Definitely would try some other things too. Seriously, go check it out their food man.. you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's alright. Tastes exactly like heat-up PF Changs but the thing I didn't like the most was that when I ordered fried-rice, it was extremely apparent that they just threw some soy sauce in the white rice steamer and spooned it out a couple minutes later. It was probably because we ordered at around nine in the evening so maybe they didn't want to make another big thing of actual fried rice, but I would have rather they told me it would take a while to make more actual fried rice and I would have chosen something else as a side. Anyways, when you're leaving the movie theater and you didn't want to pay seven dollars for popcorn, it's an alright place to grab some quick chinese. Even if it just tastes like mediocre PF Chang's."}
{"text":"Delivery service was great. Food was simultaneously salty and bland."}
{"text":"Best option for Chinese delivery in the area, most restaurants that deliver have absolutely zero flavor. Portions are huge and the staff is always friendly. Keep your selection simply and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese food, not what you'd look forward too but it's still a good meal. The fried rice i'd give a 2 stars... nothing special at all and I paid hefty for it! I ordered the seasame chicken and fried rice and all together with delivery fees came to around $22. I'd say it was only half worth it. The portions were nice and I shared with my family, but the food was plain and typical chinese, didn't live up to the standards."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I like that they're quick, cheap, and give you huge portions like any Chinese restaurant.

But the food was disgusting, and that isn't a word I use lightly when describing a restaurant. Their kitchen is in plain view of the entrance, and everything looks like it could use a tanker full of Lysol, everything looks grimy and unclean. 

The chicken tastes like it was cooked in three week old grease. But the worst offense was the fried rice. Not sure how that's even possible, fried rice should be the least offensive, as it just complements whatever else you're eating. But it smelled, for lack of a better word, pungent. And it tasted pungent. Never a quality I look for in rice.

 I'm not a picky eater, but the chicken and broccoli from Chopstick was one of the few times I was unable to finish my meal. Considering how many Chinese restaurants are within a couple miles from there, your choices are abundant. I'd recommend any of them but Chopstick."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here at least once a week. i have never had a bad meal. The standouts are the egg foo young, fried rice, chicken teriyaki, and mu shu. They give you enormous portions and the taste is fantastic."}
{"text":"First time ordering and having it delivered. The food was at the door in about 30 minutes. Food all looked good. Steamed dumplings, boneless ribs, and spicy shrimp. Serving size was good what was not very good was flavor. Everything was very bland. No taste in the dumpling dipping sauce. Boneless ribs were very sweet, just not my style. Spicy shrimp defaults to medium heat and I changed that to HOT. It was very bland.  No real flavor let alone any heat."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, don't be fooled by the amount of stars on Yelp. Keep in mind that food is very subjective and my personal opinion is that they do an amazing job with their steamed dumplings and crab rangoon. I've had their fried rice and other dishes but frankly I prefer the stuff on their appetizer menu. 
You can dine in, carry out or have them deliver the food. I've done all three. The ambience is not much, very basic but I come for the food not for the decor."}
{"text":"I will never eat here, or really \"attempt to eat\" here again. I ordered for lunch at work, going to save half for my dinner. The crab rangoons were tasty. It wasn't until I went to eat the chicken teriyaki that I saw there was a worm on the chicken. It was a curled up, ribbed worm. I called them to let them know and their response was \"well I've never gotten that complaint before\", almost to say I was lying. Then I wanted a refund. I was told \"I can only give you a refund for the chicken\". I don't know what they didn't understand of \"due to the worm in my food, I can't even begin to touch anything\". The entree was untouched. I didn't even open the box. I had $16 of food that I refused to eat and they only wanted to refund me $5. Horrible customer service. When something goes wrong on the business end, they should refund you. I wasn't asking for a refund of a huge or obscene amount of money. It was less than twenty bucks and that seemed awful to them. After arguing, I was told by Tiffany I would receive a refund of the whole amount. I'll only believe it when I see it on my card as refunded. Chinese food is ruined for me. I understand that raw meat can contain such things, but it was on top. It wasn't attached to the meat. It was moveable."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price. Fast and friendly service! Food is always hot and special requests are never ignored. Coupons are also sent periodically via email."}
{"text":"One of the few Chinese places that delivers around Matthews, NC! Not only that, but the food was great! You give instructions and they execute. Quick, easy, satisfying and the portions! You can save for another meal, so it's definitely worth the value. Crazy this place isn't higher rated!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to Chinese place but since coming under new management it has gotten TERRIBLE.

We have ordered twice since it's been under new management - the 1st time the crab ragoons were stale, the food lacked it's spice, the Teriyaki chicken which our young sons usually love were practicality burnt to a crisp and there were noticeable less meat on the stick. 

The second time we decided would be our last. Once again the food lacked good flavor - the curry chicken wasn't spicy anymore! - THEN 20 MINUTES AFTER HIS MEAL MY HUSBAND HAD STOMACH CRAMPS AND DIARRHEA!!!

We later learned that two days earlier my brother and his family had ordered from them and everyone has bad gas and stomach cramps. My youngest neice, just 5 years old, spent the night in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give a negative star rating? When we moved here a few years ago the food was decent, but we went with it because they had delivery and we had a newborn & didn't want to go out too much in the winter. After a few deliveries, the food got disgusting. My husband's chicken dinner & my beef dinner both tasted like fish. They did give us our money back, but we gave up on them. After a year passed, we gave them another chance. The food was decent & delivery time was decent. However after two or so deliveries, things quickly turned south. Last time our delivery was promised in 30 minutes, but took an hour. This time (our final chance for them) we were told it would take an hour (this was at 4:45). At 6:30, our order arrived. The sweet and sour chicken was a much smaller portion than we've received previously (about half). When we called they said that the order size was indeed correct. Our smaller portion of chicken was partially filled with crispy pieces of fried batter instead of actual chicken. Fried rice was mediocre this time around. We did receive a \"complimentary\" Chinese wall scroll with our order that had a half naked Chinese girl on it. In a house filled with little boys, it quickly found its way to the trash. We'll definitely be finding a different restaurant next time we're in the mood for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I use to work next door at a southern soul food place that closed down. And at night while taking out the trash in the back to the dumpster I seen that their back door was open. You could see that one of the workers was washing their daughters hair in the sink that they prep food in . Beside the sink was uncooked uncovered egg rolls stacked up on top of the counter with nothing underneath beside the sink with the hair . It made me think I would never eat here again because I seen how unsanitary they were. And I have eaten here before.. don't get me wrong the rice was good and the other entree I ordered was good but after seeing that they are doing hair in the same kitchen that the publics food is prepared.. I Will Never Go Back !!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Loved the delivery service, online ordering was so easy. Oh, absolutely in love with their chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Why can't we give half stars?  This place is not quite 3 stars IMHO.  I just moved into the neighborhood and am looking for great Chinese food. Unfortunately this ain't it.

It's okay, not great. The kind of food you \"settle\" for, not really look forward to. I had delivery and it was fast and friendly with good sized portions.  I read some reviews of the fried rice not being very good, and for good reason. It's not very good.   Stick with the steamed white rice....it's better for you anyway. ;-) 

I may be spoiled by New Asian Cuisine in Mint Hill, but I will say this about Chopstick.  When they mark something as being spicy (Tangerine Chicken and Sa Cha Beef). They really deliver the heat."}
