{"text":"Very good restaurant. The staff is very nice and welcoming. The food is really good and authentic. \"It has this Colombian's' seal of approval\" ;)
Ordered the Mondongo soup which is a Colombian tripe soup. Amazing.  As good as my grandmother's!
My non Colombian husband has the bandeja Paisa and he was really impressed. Rice, beans, chorizo, egg, plantain and lots of flavour. 
Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Service was very bad and slow, no one bothered to come back to the table to check up on us or refill drinks. The food quality was pretty poor, never had a bandeja paisa taste so bad. The mango juice with milk was very watered and icy, didn't have much flavour. The avocado on a plate was inedible, when asked the waitress to switch it, she took so long that by the time she came back we finished eating. Not going to come back."}
{"text":"This place is my new favourite Latin American restaurant. Came in randomly one day and am so glad! It was late at night, a bit before closing but the staff was very friendly and polite, the owner (I believe) even came to our table to talk to us about the store and our tastes. It was incredible and really made me appreciate the place. The owner wants to get to know his clients!

Anyway, I had their vegetarian meal and it was AMAZING. Great portions, the beans were the best I've ever had. The owner had mentioned that a lot of other places cook their beans in a pork sauce so it's not vegetarian but his is completely veggie. I'm not a vegetarian but I appreciated that tidbit. The portion was great and the price was only $9.99! We also got an arepa appetizer (with fresco cheese... mmmm) and their Tres Leches dessert, but also delicious!

He brought us chili sauce that's officially the best chili sauce I've had. Then he brought me a drink (called lulo or something along those lines)... officially my new favourite drink now! It was the perfect amount of citrus, tangy and sweet.

Will definitely be back here, already spread the word to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is the first time I've had colombian food so I cannot speak for it's authenticity but the food here is amazing. I really wish it wasn't so far for me as I would definitely be a regular there. 
The owner is really friendly, being our first time eating colombian food, he took the time to walk us through the menu and give us recommendations. 

I especially like the tripe soup. Very very flavourful! A must try, you can get this in a smaller sized to go with a main (if you want to try more).

Remember that there is parking behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"We showed up early for dinner before any other diners and the owner came by to explain the menu to us. He was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the cornbread and cheese. It was difficult to cut but good. We also got the chicken soup that was good. Others got the beef tongue which they thoroughly enjoyed. The meat was very tender. The plantain chips that came as a side was very delicious. The meals didn't come together because the meals took a little longer. Overall, I would try them again."}
{"text":"I was invited here by a fellow yelper friend for his birthday dinner. First of all the \"Parking\" is located and hidden at the back of the restaurant and its quite small. 

we all got a seat in front of the restaurant and cramped up into a booth. The service was quite good and the server was very friendly. The owner himself came to check up on us and later came to chat with us about the place and Colombian cuisine. 

First came the appetizers plantain chips, fried cheese sticks (Palitos de Queso) and empanadas. I had the Plantain and cheese sticks which were quite good. I also got their one of their milk drinks which was good as well plus the Postobon soda as well.

For the main course I had the vegetarian option of their Bandejas Paisas dish. Which came with Rice, egg, beans, corn bread, Plantain, avocado and salad. It was quite good.

Then the birthday boy ordered about four desserts for all of us and boy they were sweet to the goodness. 

Overall a great Colombian experience!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere.  Staff is very helpful and friendly. Food was great. It was my first time to ever try Colombian food and I really enjoyed the taste. I tried several starters, especially I liked cheese sticks. Also I tried a few main course dishes because I visited this restaurant for a few times. I would say beef tongue dish is my favorite but all the other dishes I tried were excellent. Deserts were delicious as well. My favorite so far is something which translates as 'three milks'. It is very creamy and soft. I was also in this restaurant for their salsa Friday. It was a lot of fun with great music and dancing. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The waiter was both friendly and very helpful! The menu is not extensive, however there are some vegetarian options. Food was delicious! Especially the fried plantains!!! I ordered the vegetarian plate which had rice, beans, salad, plantain (fried and sweet), and an arepa. The owner was also very kind! I would definitely come back because of the service!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday get together.  We ended up taking the big booth near the front entrance of the restaurant.  The booth fit 6 of us and we added two more chairs on the outside so in total our table was for 8.

The birthday boy ordered some appetizers for all of us and they came out on a huge platter.  We had plantain chips, fried cheese as well as empanadas.  All were very good.  There was some confusion with the drink orders and it seemed rather busy in the dining area.  The service was very friendly but they just seemed a little disorganized.

There was another large party and while the place was or seemed very busy for a Friday we did have to wait for our food a while.  When the food eventually made it to the table though wow.  I'm glad there was that much attention and love paid to my dish and all the dishes though.  My plate was some sight.  I had ordered the Super Bandeja platter which included (as per the menu):  rice, beans, 4 oz steak, Colombian bacon and sausage, green plantain chip, sweet plantain, avocado, egg, corn flatbread, and black sausage.

OK so this plate which is 20 bucks is a crazy amount of food especially on the meat side.  Despite the quantity the quality was very good as well.  Colombian food is not spicy but it's not necessarily bland either.  The blood sausage was probably the most tasteless thing if I had to pick one but everything else was pretty much as expected.  The steak was good and most of the textures compliment each other.  The rice and beans, the different plantains but the bacon/pork belly is the stand out item here.  This bacon is really mouthwatering because it's not your everyday cut of bacon.  The shape of this cut is almost like a saw blade with thin and thinner parts but with a nice balance of both meat and fat to keep the texture and taste very interesting.

The birthday boy also generously ordered dessert for everybody as well.  I didn't have any because I don't eat sweets but I have to say that everything looked really well put together.  Everybody seemed to enjoy the food very much considering all the plates were pretty much done.  

The service and atmosphere was fun and the owner was very welcoming and loved to talk.  This is a great place if you're looking for a change from everyday fare and something a little different and special at the same time.  The whole time I was there I felt like I was on vacation."}
{"text":"Driven by here a few times. Last night I just thought maybe its a good time to give it a try for Colombian food. The restaurant was packed with Colombian customers so that's a good sign. Food was good but I had to add hot sauce. I learned from the owner of the restaurant that Colombian food are not supposed to be spicy and they are not like Mexican food. Luckily, the owner grabbed the hot sauce hidden in the fridge. The sausage was really flavorful.
They had a lot of servers for a small restaurant. All of them were really friendly and attentive.  
Ate and Ordered: Bandeja Paisa, Patacon Carne, and Carne A La Plancha"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  When you think of the places at Hwy 5 and Hwy 10, you think of good food in a dive.  This place is the complete opposite.

a) There is a parking lot in the back and it's not as cramped as all the other one's at the 5/10 intersection.  

b) It's nicely decorated and has a bit of class to it. It feels like somewhere you could take a date or have a nice family meal. 

c) Owner and server are friendly.  

d) They have exotic juices. E.g. I've been looking to replicate my soursop juice experience from Costa Rica for a few years now and couldn't.  This place actually uses ripened soursop pulp from Colombia as opposed to the shipped ones here which is actually a benefit. You can actually taste the combination of sour and sweetness that comes from fresh soursop.  

As for the food itself, I was really hungry so I had:

1) Empanada app (3 small ones for $4.50)
2) The special of the day, which included Sopa de avena (\"oat soup\" - but it really is  like a hearty chicken and vegetable soup) and a beef dish with salad, rice, and plantain for $10.99

The empanada's were stuffed to the brim, hot and crispy and the salsa they served with it was pretty good.

The soup was light yet hearty at the same time.  It had a very distinct chicken and coriander taste, absolutely lovely.  As for the meat dish, not greasy, good presentation, and meat was tender.  

Verdict: I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I give it one star for friendly service, but the food was not up to standard at all. I was actually really looking forward to trying this place after reading all the great reviews. I've had (homemade) Colombian food many times before, and although it's not supposed to be spicy like some other Latin foods, it is supposed to have some kind of flavour/seasoning. This unfortunately did not. (When you're paying someone to cook, you expect it to be at least as good or better than homemade!)

We ordered the empanadas, pantacon relleno de pollo and the bandeja paisa. When we asked what the most popular dish was, the bandeja paisa was first on the list. Quite disappointing as nothing on the plate stood out except for the chicharron and the sweet plantain, the only flavourful items (one salty, the other sweet). Everything else just tasted like very plain gut-fill, to be honest. The dining room has seen better days with dirty windows, duct taped banquette seating and worn plastic tablecloths. Can't help but wonder about the hygiene in the kitchen as I found a hair stuck to my plantain. I quietly left and do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"Free Parking in the back. Very friendly owner. Very helpful staff. And good quality food. We will return again:) Thank you for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Stellar! And in the heart of Mississauga. This spot is located half a block from the Northwest corner of Hurontario Street and Dundas Street (just north of the Cooksville Colonnade building). As others have said, parking can be found behind the building. 

First, environment and service. Clean, welcoming, with visible effort to make the place look nice. Very warm, pleasant atmosphere, nice music - everything together made for a great dining experience. Thanks to Sophia, our server, and the restaurant owner who took care of us so attentively from start to finish!

Second, the food. In short, everything we had was DELICIOUS! Truly exceptional, and there was evidently careful thought put into meal preparation. We ordered: Empanadas, Plantain Chips, Arepas with Chicharron, the Paisita (rice, beans, various meats), and two Colombian fizzy sodas (Postobon). Everything was so, so, so, good - I can't emphasize that enough. Bursts of flavour. Good portions. Reasonable prices. The Chicharron (reminds me of Filipino Lechon) was so crispy. The empanadas were crunchy and stuffed generously. There was nothing we didn't like, and everything was a treat to taste.

They really make you feel welcome here. They don't make your dining experience a disengaging one - if you're unfamiliar with Colombian food, they talk to you about the menu, they get to know your likes and dislikes and recommend accordingly. 

An absolute gem in the heart of Mississauga and we'll definitely be back. This place is great for group dinners, family dinners, and makes a great date spot too - a restaurant for all ages and occassions. For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to around $47.00."}
{"text":"I've had some Latin cuisine in their respective countries, but I've never had food or an experience like that at Colombia Mia. A friend and I started with the empanadas and patacones and wish we could have had those the whole night. The salsas provided were different but perfect for each one. The empanadas don't have too much potato and had a crispy dough. The bandeja paisa was huge (even though it was the small version) and the chicharones pork belly was crispy and flavourful. The chorizo was packed with flavour and I loved that the meat wasn't grinded. The tamales was comforting although I wish there was more pork in it. I've had the porkchop and the blood sausage, but I'd go back there for other things. We had the tres leches and the sweet sofia for dessert... The tres leches cake was perfectly moist and not too soupy. I usually stay away from papaya but the sweet sofia with the plantain and the cheese alongside the papaya made the pastry perfect! 

The manager and server walked us through the menu and gave incredible suggestions, and even aligned their food with our own background and past experience. They've even invited us back for salsa dancing on Fridays and taught us quite a bit. The atmosphere would be complimented with a little more decor and warm features to compliment the food and the service. Colombia Mia, you're doing great!"}
{"text":"Preface:  I am not an expert on Colombian food.  My experiences are limited to the Las Delicias (nearby, menu is quite different though) and eating in Costa Rica (which is supposed to have similar foods).

Parking:  FREE & pretty plentiful, around the back of the restaurant, turn into this alley-looking driveway and suburban heaven of paved space opens up to you.

Menu:  Offers a variety of things from apps/soups, breakfast, arepas (wonder if they're the same as Arepa Café?), different kind of drinks, & even quite extensive desserts!  So they have something for everyone.

Interior:  Surprisingly nice, especially where the 5&10 are concerned.  Most establishments in this area are older, rundown dumpy, immigrant joints, and Colombia Mia actually classes it up!  This includes the ambient lighting.

Server/owner:  I'm pretty sure our male server was also the owner, but he was such a gentleman.  So extremely polite.

Food:  I already ate, so I split the tostones, tried some of my friend's tamale, and then ordered a Tres Leches cake here.  Cake was very nice, sweet, but not sickeningly sweet.  It's a soaked/wet cake, so don't be surprised if you've never had it before.  Fresh roasted coffee was also nice and smooth.  

Tostones had a nice flavour, smashed nice and thin, and did bring me back to Costa Rica.

I tried some of my friend's tamale and it was good too.  It's different than a Mexican tamale 'cause first, it was more of a meal-size (~$8.99) and it was packed with pieces of chicken.  Tasted very homey.  Please note:  If you're really into salty food, you may find it somewhat bland, but I prefer slightly bland than overly doused in sodium.  

We asked owner for hot sauce and he brought us some that he MADE to the table.  He added that Colombians actually do NOT eat spicy foods.  So that was interesting to find out.  Sauce was NICE, fresh, and had a bit of a kick to it.  Definitely a nice addition to the tamale!

Aside from the food, what stood out about Colombia Mia was the 1) exceptional service, owner seems to really care and 2)  the nice interior.  Everything else, re:  home cooked foods and good price points are bonuses!"}
{"text":"The food is great with big portions!! I'm only giving it a three because a lot of the food is heavily fried and I'm not a huge fan of fried food. But if you don't mind fried food then this is a great place to check out with quality Colombian food! The fruity drinks are also amazing!  We had empanadas for appetizers and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"My visit here was also first time trying Colombian food!

And what a great place to try & experience it. 

ATMOSPHERE:
Casual, family-friendly restaurant. TVs are always on with football/soccer. On Friday evenings they have Latin dancing!

SERVICE: 
Alonso, the owner, greeted our party, seated us and served us through the entire meal. He was warm and friendly. Made excellent recommendations throughout our time there, and even invited us to other events they host. He was very hospitable.

The food & drinks came out fast. There was a mix-up with our beverages, but Alonso handled it professionally and with great care.


PRICE:
Very reasonable.  We got 3-course worth of food, plus beverage, for $26 (incl. tax)


FOOD: I went with a group of 6 - so we tried a bunch of food together. Sharing is the best! Here's what we had:

- 5 Fresh Juices (Sour Sop, Passion Fruit, Spanish Blackberry, and Guava with milk):  Guava was clear winner. And made with milk, it tasted similar to a strawberry milkshake. Sooo refreshing!  I also enjoyed the Sour Sop and Passion Fruit.  The Spanish Blackberry was too tart for my liking.

- Plantain chips: DELICIOUS. So tasty. Yummo.

- Cazuela de Mariscos (Seafood chowder, with plantains and coconut rice (beware raisins - if you're not a fan of raisins) ): This was my FAVOURITE item.  It had LOTS of seafood. There was a good mix/variety of seafood in it. And the coconut rice (sweet) paired wonderfully with the chowder. Good portion size.

- Arepa de Chocolo con Quesito (tender-sweet corn-flatbread topped with Spanish fresh cheese):  Simple and tasty. Really enjoyed this one - especially since some of our other dishes had stronger flavours.

- Brevas Con Arequipe (sweet preserved figs stuffed with caramelized condensed milk, paired with fresh cheese): This was the fig dessert that sounded amazing on paper (fig + cheese + condensed milk). I then found it too sweet. All that dulche de leche!


Overall, really enjoyed my meal here. Will definitely be back to try other items from the menu!"}
