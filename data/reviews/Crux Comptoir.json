{"text":"Crux is a great juice bar with a passionate owner. You can get healthy food and drinks or even a comprehensive juice cleanse program to follow. Their juices taste great and are competitively priced. I've already completed a 3-day cleanse and enjoyed it so much that I'm on my second cleanse now. I continue to see more people with every visit. As the store gets discovered more and more, I just hope the support and service will remain status quo. Parking is never an issue with the free underground parking."}
{"text":"I'm from toronto and find it incredibly difficult when I come to The Montreal area to find a good cold pressed juice place with lots of healthy treats. This place fits the bill! So many selection of cold press juices in 2 different sizes. They pride themselves on being dairy free and having loads of gluten free options. The staff is so helpful and their energy date balls are really good, and their brownies rock. Along with all these great things they also make coffee, and along With normal coffee they also make cold brew Which is also difficult to find. Great places doing great things they should definitely have one in the city unless Montreal ppl aren't about that?"}
{"text":"Quaint little spot for a smoothie bowl and taking pictures. This place has less than 20 seats. During the time it took to eat a smoothie bowl, we saw a constant pouring of customers coming in for a smoothie bowl to eat at one of the tables or to go. A fridge offers premade salads and a selection of drinks also. The coffees are served in a lovely double handle mug, my latte was strong and I chose to try it with coconut milk, it was delicious! I had the colada bowl which tasted fresh and reminded me of a pina colada. I believe all the smoothie bowls offered have a base of acai berry so they are red in color for the most part. I really enjoyed the curcuma granola, something new time me, choosing a smoothie bowl is also expecting to get a beautiful presentation, we were not disappointed. Only down side is the lack of seats. Service was top notch ever though they were training 2 employees."}
{"text":"Their grilled vegetables wrap is AMAZING and has goat cheese in it :) also their quinoa salad is delicious, and they have cold lattes that are perfect for the summer and are also healthy. The only reason why I'd rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's really pricey but apart from that everything you can buy there is pretty much delicious :)"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Stumbled upon it while visiting Montreal and I'm so happy we did! I'm disappointed I do not remember the gentleman's name but I believe he is a manager or owner. When he found out we were first time visitors he welcomed us to try some of their cold pressed juices and they were incredible! I loved the flavor with beets, such a pleasant surprise!! 

After we tasted some juices we got acai bowls and they were so delicately decorated with fruits, seeds, granola etc. . So pretty and they tasted amazing! My previous experience with other bowls are just icy bowls of blended fruit but these were so smooth and creamy! 

The same man later came to our table and gave us a sample of one of their smoothies! He was so kind!! I wish there was a place as great as this in NY! Will definitely be back next time I visit and will recommend this place to anyone I know going to Montreal!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a juice bar and I happen to stumble upon this cute place, with it's lovely big yellow painted door. For vegans and vegetarians looking for healthier food in the old port this place is an oasis in the middle of all the steakhouses and meaty breakfast, lunch and dinner restaurants that serve all sort of animal parts."}
{"text":"So glad more healthy options are springing up. This place is just a few doors down from Mandy's. It's very small but well designed and very efficient.  Did I mention how pretty it is?  It's very warm and bright and has a really good energy.  Will have to remember to come here when I'm feeling unaccomplished. I felt like I could conquer the world after I left. Maybe it was the green juice...  Didn't have time to lounge so I grabbed a combo to go. I got 1/2 a wrap (chicken Cesar)and two small salads (quinoa and ? --- oops...forgot what it was) as well as one of their small cold pressed juices. Everything was really good.  So happy they are near."}
{"text":"We finally have a real juice bar at the Square at Dix30. This brand new spot just opened a few days ago. If you are thirsty or hungry, or just feel like having an healthy snack during your break, I would highly recommend this place. Plus, Alexa who is taking care of Crux is such an inspiring and dynamic person. 

They don't offer only juice, kombucha and smoothie, but also wraps, salads and yogurts. The wrap I ordered was super healthy and tasty. I also tried two smoothies this week and they were both delicious. I love the organic coffee they use for their iced latte. 

Since Crux opened, I try to go everyday. It's so convenient and directly in the middle of The Square. I'm going to become a regular there and you should try it ASAP."}
{"text":"When you have the first spoon of the smoothie bowl, your mouth gets happy, after a few bites, your tummy is happy. 
The owner \"Renault\" is passionate about the food and customer service. He knows his juices! 
The ambience is excellent as well. Highly recommend it."}
