{"text":"More than ordinary, small and very pretentious restaurant alla \"Fast Food\"... at excessive prices. Stefano Faita should review its standards of quality vs prices vs. service.

WOW! What a bad story it was. To read...

- Their hotdog at $ 7.75 is just a vulgar hotdog sausage (which Tousignant claims to be made from 100% local beef and beef). Okay. But after having tasted it, I judge that the proportion is rather 30% of their 100% local meat ... mixed with 70% of bad fillings. But it's definitely a little better than the Hygrade sausage!

- Their cheeseburger at $ 7.50 is a shame for the smallness of its meat and its small slice of Kraft cheese. If at least it was a fresh slice of thicker Cheddar. But tomatos and onions are cut into very thick slices ... with a lot of iceberg lettuce. Wow!

- If you like fries dull and greasy, go Chez Tousignant!

- If you order chicken to take-out, make sure your cup of BBQ sauce is not only half filled ... and that your chicken piece is full before you leave.

Do not deign to complain about their incompetence, unless you accept to be humiliated to have done it by the Chef himself. The service is nonchalant and haughty."}
{"text":"Just had my first hot dog Tousignant.  My favourite greasy-spoon style hot dog in MTL, bar none!  Golden brown perfectly toasted bun,  homemade hot dog nestled in a crispy nest of bacon, house sauce and 3 pickles.  Damn damn good.  I'll be going back for it more often. ;)"}
{"text":"Exactement ce que j'attendais de Tousignant : un retour au fast food de mon enfance. Merci !"}
{"text":"Don't hesitate to go check out this place. Definitely get a cheeseburger and poutine just to complete the meal !"}
{"text":"Easily the best hot dog in town. Everything is homemade from the brioche bread to the sausage and ground beef. The Tousignant sauce is a must and makes the usual ketchup and mustard useless. The only drawback, it's really busy so make sure you're not in a hurry or a big group or you should do take out instead."}
{"text":"OK, the burger is good but nothing extraordinary. The poutine is nothing to call home about. Overrated."}
{"text":"Great new little greasy spoon just off Bélanger. Very cute building and interior arrangement, very friendly staff and even a few little outdoor tables. 

I had the cheeseburger, a poutine and the tousignant hot dog. The hot dog takes the win here, with cheese, bacon, pickles and special sauce it gives the perfect flavours but didn't take away from the homemade dog itself was juicy, smoky and delicious. The fries were my favorite type (Lafleur style) and the homemade gravy had plenty of flavour but lacked salt. The burger was also good and juicy but nothing overly special. I topped it off with a mediocre vanilla milkshake. 

Everything was a little pricy, but perfect to fill that fast-food pang we all get from time to time."}
{"text":"Good burgers, fantastic service, good milkshake, ok poutine, dry donut. 
The burger patty although juicy and delicious is quite small, maybe 1/4 lb. Given the steep price, I'd expect more beef! Also, your Kraft yellow cheese on your cheeseburger, needs to go."}
{"text":"Good but not excellent. Overpriced for what you get and the marketing behind the project is what makes this place busy and more show than go. Worth a shot  but there are better burgers in the city"}
{"text":"Nous avons essayé les hot dogs, les frites, la poutine, hamburger, leur liqueur maison (cerise et racinette). C'était bon, mais pas extraordinaire. Allez l'essayer, les pains maison sortent un peu de l'ordinaire."}
{"text":"OMG Do you even burger bro? This is like the Mecca. Omg I'm writing such a fanboy review and I don't care this place delivered so hard on this second visit I gotta say undisputed heavyweight burger champ of the city here. Get the TOUSIGNANT. Thank me a few times then get another. Rinse and repeat. Ad infinitum."}
{"text":"Any place ( bar, restaurant ..) should be divided into 3 categories. Its service, its quality and the look. 
The look is fun. Really like the old dinner style with a twist. Clean decor that won't go out of style. 
The service was amazing. First time here and got a run through of most of the things on the menu. For me it's a real selling point. 
If you're looking for a cheap corner dinner however you won't find that here. Prices are up there but it goes with the quality."}
{"text":"Best. Diner. Ever. I mean seriously, everything here is fresh and homemade, from the burgers, buns, pies, even the hotdogs! 

Although greasy food isn't typically my #1 pick, if I'm going to have it, this is where I want to eat it! Tousignant excels at the classics you'd expect from a diner, but done much better than you've ever had. 

Everything was fresh and made to order. I shared the small poutine, which was huge & delicious. I also had a regular burger. The meat was very fresh and tasty, and was perfectly balanced by the homemade bun. A bit too much mayo for my taste, but overall great burger. 

This place is backed by the Impasto and Gema guys, which definitely brings a lot of cred. We met the owner/chef who was such a nice and friendly guy. He showed us the pictures on the wall which are old black and whites of his family. The name \"Tousignant\" is actually his moms last name. We talked a lot about food, and told us he not only makes his own hamburger meat, he also makes his own hotdog sausages, all from beef shoulder! Can't wait to try the hotdogs now! 

My meal ended with a chocolate milkshake, made from their homemade chocolate custard ice cream."}
{"text":"Deliciously old fashioned.. 
Having been to many burger restaurants that range from fancy and expensive to greasy and cheap, Chez Tousignant hit the spot beautifully! Every bite of the way. 
Upon entering I was a bit turned off by the large crowd and very compact space. I had a long wait ahead of me. Don't let that turn you off! 
Yes, the place is very small and often crowded, yet that is a good sign of success and doing things right. Which they do! 
I wanted to go simple when ordering. So I chose a regular burger with extra bacon. Do keep in mind the burger along with the buns everything is completely homemade. Along with fries, of course! Again homemade from freshly cut spuds! 
Upon ordering I noticed how kind and professional their staff was. Friendly and helpful as well. Which is a must! 
We waited about 10-15 mins for our meal. Again, every bite worth waiting for. Finally we were lucky enough to grab a table. While waiting, we enjoyed the great variety of 80's tunes.. Great choice! 
Now, time to eat! Our burgers arrived wrapped and served hot. Fries were golden and crispy. Not salty! 
Bacon was crisp with a great smokey touch. Tomato lettuce and onion, fresh and ripe. 
Their hot dogs are like no other. Long, perfectly cooked and homemade.. Nothing like those other greasy joints(You know who they are!) 
Overall the food was outstanding!! Great place and very reasonably priced as well. 
Anything negative? Yes! The place is far too small and crowded for their large amount of people due to their well deserved success."}
{"text":"This is the worst burger and fries I have ever had in my life. Burger was pasty and under seasoned. There special sauce has absolutely no flavor and the bun is boring. Also should mention the burger cost $7.50 plus tax which is completely absurd. It tasted like a bad version of an In & Out burger. The fries were also mediocre. Not crispy, not hot and absolutely no seasoning. I had a bite of the poutine as well. There was not enough sauce, the sauce was under seasoned and the poutine got cold within a few minutes. All in all terrible experience."}
{"text":"Now that I know this place is right beside the Jean Talon market I will visit more often. It's a very unpretentious and yet hip spot that has great selections of classic casse croute in a slightly healthier way. We enjoyed the burger, blt and regular poutine. Nice touch on their homemade sodas and music choice."}
{"text":"Simple but outstanding! You can definitely taste the
quality ingredients used. Worth the price and a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant. Like 5 Guys but with truly fresh ingredients.  French fries were heavenly!"}
{"text":"Je souhaitais l'essayer depuis un bon moment. Tout le monde m'en parlait, les avis étaient partagés. Personnellement, j'ai bien aimé. Le service est peut-être un peu lent mais les portions sont généreuses, contrairement à ce qu'on m'avait dit.

Un peu coûteux. Mais la viande est juteuse à souhait, la poutine est excellente, les beignes sont bons. Bref, à essayer!"}
{"text":"Made in-house and local does have its price, but the $7.75 Hot dog Tousignant tastes only slightly better than Costco's original all-beef hot dog. The layout and atmosphere is really classic yet un-ratchet. I also eyed two beer taps said to be used sometime in the future. That'd be pretty revolutionary.

You can call it a chic 5-star câsse-croute. But ouch, almost $9 for a toasted hot dog, no sides or drinks. I'm not convinced by the value proposition here."}
{"text":"This has been on my bookmarked list for quite some time now, so when my husband said he was craving a nice burger and hot dog, I jumped at the chance to cross this off my list. 

The interior is cute, it has a nice retro yet modern diner vibe to it with the silver stools. The bathroom was spotless which is always nice, and the fact that they had a change table and high chair is a plus when dining with my 1 year old. Once you are in the restaurant, it is stroller friendly with the wide and uncluttered space, but be warned, the entrance is far from stroller or disability friendly, thankfully we had some nice fellow diners help us navigate those stairs and the double doors.

The menu itself is simple, which I appreciated! We tried the cheeseburger (omg, don't know how they do it but it melts in your mouth), the patty itself is just big enough, not one of those 1/2 lb burgers that's for sure and topped with your classic pickles, tomato, ketchup and mustard, onions and lettuce, it was flavorful, juicy but not greasy, something I'll come back for over and over again! 

The classic poutine was good, but not the best I've ever had. The hot dog was great, not overly salty mush but a good quality hot dog and the grilled cheese had a great amount of cheese with thick crusty bread, it was yummy . I also really enjoyed the root beer, so much better than the canned stuff you get."}
{"text":"I like this place so much I went twice in two days. The menu is pretty small but it all looked so good that I wanted to try EVERYTHING, and I was NOT disappointed. The homemade hotdogs are pretty good but the stars of the show are the fantastic cheeseburgers, closely followed by the club sandwich. The milkshakes and fries are good too, though the fries are better without the sauce. Plus, the staff are super nice and the place is bright and clean. This is officially my favourite diner in Montreal, and the best place I've found for a burger so far."}
{"text":"The burger was just OK, with nothing to stand out. The frites were quite good. The biggest disappointment was the frozen custard. For $5 CAD, whereas soft serve is normally served with a large looping dollop at the top, this was served only level to the edge, resulting in a really small amount. I wouldn't recommend it, and the top gelato places in the city that people considered pricey give you much more for the money.

It's a diner like atmosphere inside, faux retro, situated near the Marche Talon market."}
{"text":"Chez Tousignant is a huge addition to Montreal's burger scene! The cheeseburger I had today was amazing, the fries were great, and that black cherry cola had that classic taste. Definitely deserving of a 5 star review, the 5 star should be enough to tell you guys to go and try out their burger!"}
{"text":"Love this place! High quality diner food in a cute setting adjacent to the Jean talon market. I recommend the tousignat dog and burger. Skip the fries and get a milkshake it's awesome. One complaint: it's chaotic which makes the wait a little long."}
{"text":"Chez Tousignant is tucked away a corner away from the Jean-Talon market, which means that if all those fresh veggies and fruits are not your type of happy food, you can always hop a street over and find comfort in hot, greasy and oh-so-good carbs and proteins. I think the heat that followed the opening has burned off a bit, because although it was a busy Saturday night, we all placed our orders within 10 mins. We got seats at the bar, and waited while watching sports. Habs were playing Rangers (and got eliminated booo).  

The interior is super retro, with pastel colors, round diner stools and metal milkshake cups. All that was missing was a jukebox! The crew was wearing cool-looking Tousignant-branded caps and sweaters. Even the table mats looked good. In fact, I liked them so much I took a clean one home (and no I don't know what to do with it now). I got a double burger and my boyfriend a regular cheeseburger. We shared a Tousignant hot-dog. Our root beer float was actually Tousignant-brand, with the catchphrase \"Parce que vous l'meritez\" (Because you deserve it). We got our food after maybe 15 mins. The double burger and the hot-dogs were good, but I almost immediately regretted not getting the cheeseburger. What was I thinking?? A burger with no cheese is like a bed with no pillow! So I stepped back in line and ordered another cheeseburger. Then devoured it. 

We all left smiling in a state of beatitude, just like the small photograph of Frère André in the back of the kitchen. There's something about this little snack bar that's really, really special. Maybe it's the nostalgic vibe of it all, maybe it's the impeccable, yet simple comfort food it offers. What I'm sure of, however, is that I'll be back. Every day if I could afford it."}
{"text":"STOP THE PRESS!!! The burgers are unbelievably delicious! Nothing is frozen and bought. From their patties, hot-dogs, buns, fries everything is homemade. Even their sodas are homemade! The meat patty is thin but cooked on a flat-top so you get this crispy outer-layer and juicy on the inside...it's to die for! The buns are just the right size, the condiments are standard works (tomatoes, lettuce, onion, pickles), but it's the sauce that brings everything together. They actually replicated the \"Big Mac\" sauce. It tastes almost the same and looks the same. So you can just imagine a Big Mac made with wholesome, fresh, homemade ingredients- it's the Big Mac for grown ups...LOL! 

I'm not a big fan of hot-dogs, but I got to give them props. They give their dogs the same attention and care as the burgers so you know your going to eat a high-quality and tasty hot-dog.

The only negative I have to say, and this is really a personal taste, the fries are a little too over-cooked for my liking. I like my fries lightly-golden and crispy. These are brown-crusted and a bit too soft. Although if you get the poutine, it's as traditional as you can get- everything just works!

Finally, the service is great. Everyone is young, hip and always smiling. The place looks like a small 50's dinner with a eat-at-the-bar counter so you can drool while they are preparing your food. The music is cool 80's vibe, so perfect for a 47 year old like me reminiscing while eating a great burger."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place!!

I love the old dinner feel, I love the paper place mats with the little t's, i love the friendliness of the employees. Nothing but love for this place.

I got the burger and a milkshake. What people have said about the burger is true. It's the best. Really good patty, excellent bread and the cheese is perfectly melted and delicious. They also add a special sauce and it is delightful. 

The milkshake was also really good, a bit more milky than I prefer (I like it when there's more ice cream) but it didn't bother me. 

One of the best places in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I had the Tousignant burger and it was P*E*R*F*E*C*T.
The patty was perfectly cooked.
The bun was fluffy like the clouds in heaven.
The veggies were oh.so.fresh. 
And the vanilla milkshake had that ... \"cereal milk\" taste. - Yum.

I should've eaten more.
I WILL be back."}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon, located on a small street. Owned by Michael Forgione, a well-known local chef that wanted to make greasy spoons great again.

The burgers are delicious, Tasty, fatty, and juicy. The potatoes buns are made in-house, the cheese is decadently melted, and the pickle is amazing.

The poutine has a sweet and salty sauce, with a great umami feel. The add a bit of paprika to give it a kick. The cheese is fresh, having that distinctive squishy feeling.

I took out a star because it's super pricey, but I believe its worth it."}
{"text":"Walked in and smelled the grill! I'm a foodie that embraces the grease and all the fat things possible so from the smell of it I liked it right when I stepped in. Small little place, a few tables and also high tables which I think are cool and you can't find much like that in restos anymore. The staff is friendly and I love the open kitchen concept. 

BUT sorry to disappoint all you readers. It was a disappointment. I got the small poutine and a tousignant cheese burger. The poutine sauce was decent but wasn't thick enough. Flavour could have been better. Fries got soggy super fast. They weren't crispy, wasn't potatoey enough for my liking. I do appreciate that the cheese was scattered everywhere and not just in the middle of the bowl. The sauce should have been so much hotter where it could melt the cheese curds because when I was eating it the cheese was still cold and hard. A good poutine has to be a balance of squeaky cheese and melty strings as well. The fries needs to be crispier, I suggest frying it twice so it keeps its crispiness longer. 

The burger was dry and nothing special. The burger meat was lacking seasoning and flattened too much where it lost all its juices. Burger was topped with cheese, purple onions, pickles, tomato, lettuce and their special Sauce (tasted like a spicy mayo). 

Overall, I will not be returning here and I really don't think it's worth the $17.55 I paid for a poutine and burger. I would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Correcte sans plus! On m'avait décrit cette endroit comme étant la place pour manger un repas du genre. Mais quand j'ai reçu ma facture de 27$ pour une Poutine, un cheezburger, un hot-dog et une liqueur, sa ma crée une plus grande attente! 

Résultat vu le prix 3/5
Résultat vu la bouffe 4,3/5"}
{"text":"We got routine here when we were visiting Montreal. We tried the basic one with gravy and cheese curds. It was good, but it wasn't great."}
{"text":"Il était une fois l'Amérique du Nord, le royaume merveilleux des hot dogs à 0.99$, de la sauce Big Mac et de la friture. McDonald, A&W, Valentine, Harvey's la Belle Province, le P'tit Québec; on les a tous fréquenté plus de fois qu'on veut se l'avouer. On le connaît, le goût de plastique des saucisses à hot dogs et le pas-de-goût des boulettes congelées, pourtant on ne peut s'empêcher d'avoir des cravings sporadiques de fast food. La demande est grande mais la qualité ne l'est pas, et ça Michel Forgione et Stefano Faita l'ont compris.

Les génies derrière le Impasto et la Pizzeria Gema se sont donné un défi de taille: Ouvrir un casse-croûte où chaque ingrédient aura été étudié, repensé et travaillé afin qu'il atteigne la perfection. C'est facile faire cuire une saucisse Lafleur et la mettre dans un pain Pom, mais créer chaque composantes à partir d'ingrédients frais et de qualités? Une autre histoire. Après plus d'un an à nous bombarder de photos durant le développement du projet, la planète (oui,) est devenue hystérique lorsque l'ouverture du casse-croûte a enfin été annoncée. On nous promettait le meilleur burger de notre vie, le meilleur hot dog, le meilleur toute. Alors, le verdict?

Ciel!

Premièrement, les yeux: Le décors est si représentatif du typique snack-bar américain qu'on pourrait croire que l'endroit été construit dans les années 90, pour ensuite avoir été parfaitement conservé durant les 25 dernières années. Une enseigne rouge flamboyante à l'entrée, des comptoirs en chrome, et des tuiles bleues pastels qui tapissent les murs. Si tu as le malheur de venir un peu trop souvent, on te saluera même par ton prénom à la caisse. Ensuite, le nez et les oreilles: L'odeur du grill embaume chaque recoin du local. On sent les frites, on entend le crépitement de la viande qui cuit au rythme de la voix de The Cure.  Mais la vrai magie opère rendu à la bouche. Cette première bouchée de hot dog change une vie. Le pain, la saucisse, la sauce, les cornichons. À peine nos dents s'enfoncent dans le pain moelleux du burger que les larmes de bonheur commencent à couler. Une sauce à poutine qu'on voudrait boire comme du jus. Des frites taillées à la main chaque matin, croustillantes de l'extérieur et tendres comme du beurre à l'intérieur. Du bacon épais, salé, goûteux, qui chante comme un ange lorsqu'il quitte la plaque de cuisson pour venir s'installer dans ton club sandwich aux côtés de tendres morceaux de poulet rôti. Mais mon coup de coeur dans tout ça? Le pain. Le pain imbibé de sauce hot chicken, le pain badigeonné de mayonnaise lorsque servit en club, le pain détrempé de sirop d'érable pour le brunch. Moelleux, délicat, blanc, sucré, salé, toasté, beurre même pas beurré, j'te pari que je pourrais passer un loaf en une journée et pas en avoir eu assez. Cette recette à elle seule leur a pris 8 mois à perfectionner, c'est pour dire tout l'effort qu'il y a pour une simple paire de toasts. 

La qualité vient avec le prix, ne soyez donc pas choqué de devoir payer plus cher que chez La Belle Pro pour votre trio. Je ne pense pas qu'on doit voir Chez Tousignant comme un snack-bar, mais plutôt comme un restaurant déguisé en casse-croûte. La morale de l'histoire va donc comme suit: Tu ne sera plus capable d'aller chez Valentine, ou nulle part ailleurs for that matter, lorsque te viendras une envie de hot dog. Après ta première visite, tes papilles gustatives en resteront marquées. La plus merveilleuse des bouchées deviendra ton plus lourd fardeau, puisqu'aucune autre ne pourra l'égaler. Manger chez Harvey's te rendra mélancolique et tu ressortiras du McDonald les mains vides, dans l'espoir d'être capable d'économiser assez pour retourner manger la malbouffe de Chez Tousignant, qui dans l'fond, n'est pas si mauvaise que ça."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious burgers. Get it with bacon and go home happy. Best burger I've had in Montreal- perfect level of grease (i.e. lots) and tasty buns.

PS. Update: The 'Tousignant Hot Dog' is a thing of cheesy, pickley glory, maybe even better than the bacon burger."}
{"text":"OMG ! Une bonne place que j'ajoute dans ma liste. Le burger était just AMAZING. Les frites cuites et croustillantes à la perfection (la prochaine fois je prend la poutine) et le hotdog fromage-bacon-cornichon...un rêve !
Je vais maintenant aller au Marché Jean Talon plus souvent juste pour luncher à ce dinner super sympa. Merci."}
{"text":"Wow! Great ambiance, great service, clean and professional. They can serve so many in no time. Full house and doesn't feel so claustrophobic. Great dinner feeling.  Love that they use Quebec products."}
{"text":"5 STAR. That's it, just go. Dirty dinner at its best. When I say everything is good, it's really good. Just writing this makes me wanna go tonight. This isn't your fancy designer truffle foie gras burger place that every wanna be top chef is making. It's simple food done right. Apparently it's very difficult to make a good burger, but these guys have it down to a science."}
{"text":"We came specifically for poutine and we weren't disappointed in the least. We had the Galvaude (chicken peas cheese fries and gravy. Great little neighbourhood joint that serves poutine burgers and dogs. Nice vibe and great food."}
{"text":"In a few years I wouldn't be surprised to find Chez Tousignant one of Montreal's famous institutions.... known across \"la ville\" and tourist alike.... it's just a question of time. The location looks humble in Little Italy...small in size with deli-like sit-in counters/tables with limited seating. I'm anxious how the establishment will handle this seating issue when it gets truly popular but I guess it'll be a nice problem to have when it'll come. And it'll come soon! When I visited, they played 90ies music and videos and while that's real cool for me, it may not be for other patrons. I'm unsure if this plays all the time or if they mix it up?

Anyways, how can I classify 'Chez Tous'? Well, I'd say it's a family oriented gourmet casse-croute with homemade solutions to your favorite types of comfort food such as burgers, hotdogs and poutines... but with a special touch that comes from true culinary experience and love. I've had my share of burgers and hotdogs but I never had them like I had them at Chez Tousignant. How many \"steamies\" have I stuffed down my pie hole in my lifetime? Too many to count but the single one I ate here left me craving for more to the point that when I see the picture of the Tousignant hotdog I ate on Yelp... I can feel my heart start to beat a little faster, I randomly check Yelp and Instagram for more pictures of this resto... and my mouth waters for no discernible reason. Folks... how can such food get such a hold of me??!

And the burger? Good god, it was fresh, high quality ingredients and it simply melted in my mouth. It was so delightful but... so incredibly FILTHY good that I'd do unspeakable things for my next one..... preferably the Tousignant one with that same sauce I loved and MAPLE HAM? HELLLOOOOOOOOOOO.

Ultimately, the food was a true 5 star experience, at least for me. The only reason I gave it 4 is quite simply the price-tag doesn't give value. Paying $15 for a burger and a hot dog with no sides or drinks to come with it doesn't sit well with me regardless how good the food is! No hot dog is worth $8. I'm sorry. 

After coming here 4 times.... fuck it.

5 stars. .

Nonetheless, if you're prepared to pay the price-tag, you're in for a good time. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon, cutie diner, with stellar decor and colour palette (your eyes need to eat too, alright). The milkshakes are some of the best town made with good ol' fashion soft serve vanilla or chocolate and 3.25% milk (cream? Is it still milk at that point? Hrm...). Apparently they've got a butter contraption that evenly smears each slice of white bread to make grilled cheese perfection. A very serious thing."}
{"text":"Good service good food didn't have to wait long at all. The burger is messy just like it should be. Nice little diner concept. Poutine was good burger was really good had the edges all crisp like...feel me cuz
Trying a bunch of new places this vacation. Every year i go i always eat at the same spot over and over. I love the hamburger bun they use, it's toasted perfectly and their sauce isn't bad either. 
The only bad thing is parking, there is none to be found one of the drawbacks to Montreal."}
{"text":"J'avais une soirée burger de prévu. Ma soirée est annulée mais pas question de laisser tomber la thématique burger. Après avoir traîné sur le site Tastet et avoir trouvé quelques pistes, je file Chez Tousignant. Sur la rue Drolet, à deux pas du marché Jean-Talon, me voilà devant la devanture. Quelques marchés et hop, on se trouve dans un resto au murs carrelés blanc avec une déco lisant sur le blanc et noir. Le décor est cool. On dirait une ancienne boucherie remise au goût du jour avec classe.

Il est temps de se pencher sur la carte. Au menu : burgers, cheese burgers, hot dog, poutine, frites pour le salé, crème molle, beignes et tarte pour le sucré.

Je craqué pour le cheeseburger Tousignant (boeuf, fromage, salade, tomates, oignons, sauce et jambon à l'érable) et une poutine.

Le cheeseburger est à tomber ! Goûtu, assaisonné parfaitement, et vraiment délicieux ! Et le bun est pile comme il faut (fait maison évidemment) !

La poutine est bonne mais assez classique finalement. Il manque justement un petit quelque chose qui la rendrait la poutine Tousignant.

J'y retournerai pour goûté le hot dog, qui a l'air vraiment bon aussi et puis pour le burger of course !"}
{"text":"Tu rentres ca sent la bouffe comme on l'aime, celle qui te fait tenir l'hiver à Montréal.
Après avoir testé plusieurs plats je pense que cette place me plait.
La sauce a poutine est bonne et à mon gout, les frites sont cuites et salés comme il le faut.
Les hots dogs sont wahouuuuu, quelque soit le hotdog c'es bon et chacun a sa petite touche qui fait que c'est unique. Les pains sont méga bons et toasté comme il le faut.
Le club sandwich est bien assaisonné avec leur sauce maison et les ingrédients sont vraiment bons. Dommage que la portion soit un peu faible à mon gout. 

Petite déception qui lui fait perdre sa 5ème étoiles c'est le prix. Pour 2 avec une petite poutine, un club sandwich, un hot dog et une frite on s'en est tiré pour 30$. Le club sandwich à plus de 10$ et ils ne donnent aucune frite avec, donc rajouter 3$ pour les frites, je trouve ca plus que limite sachant que le club m'est pas démentiel en terme de taille ...
C'est donc à mon sens le seul point négatif de l'expérience chez eux

Il n'y a pas énormément de places par rapport à l'achalandage.
Le service est dans la normal en terme de préparation de plat.
Il est aussi possible de prendre à emporter ;)

Je reviendrais pour tester d'autres plats !"}
{"text":"I have never had a better burger in my life.
The place is small, the wait is long, but it's worth every second. I had a cheeseburger with bacon. And it was actually perfect. Seriously go."}
{"text":"Cat's outta the bag and there are often lines here now so I will add more voice to the pile: Chez Tousignant is so oh so good. I had the Tousignant hot dog, fries and a Maple Syrup cola. The idea of a homemade hotdog is delightful and glorious. I don't eat a lot of meat and hot dogs in particular are conflicting for me because I have always loved them since I was a kid getting them at street carts in Toronto or on the pier in LA or at the Jersey Shore, and I've tried to not think about what goes in them. The dogs at Tousignant taste like good memories without the preservatives-and-weird-parts panic. They are delicious and the topping are heaps of tastey and the bun is fresh and flavourful and good. The fries could have a been a little crispier maybe but they taste great.

The young black guy working the front counter deserves 5 stars all on his own, super welcoming, super quick in both languages, efficient at working the line and getting people their food as it came out, even noticing that folks were slipping on the step on the way in and running out to salt the icy stair, wash his hands and not miss a beat with a grin for the next customer. Great staff and great vibes in general at this super sweet gourmet casse croute."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I've enjoyed a simple (yet not so simple) burger and fries so much. The tousignant sauce gave the burger that distinctive initial taste, before flavours from the tender and juicy beef patty kick in. The maple cola was also very enjoyable. It's a gourmet burger without too much bling. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Chez Tousignant c'est un endroit pour manger un burger dans un cadre des années 70. Certes l'endroit est sympa et le personnel aussi mais je ne suis pas un fan de leur burger. J'ai trouvé que tout nageait dans le gras et l'huile....même à travers le papier mon burger était gras. 

C'est vraiment dommage car au final c'est ce qui ressort le plus dans la dégustation : le gout de gras..."}
{"text":"Holy bowl of cannelloni is this place ever amazing. 

I brought the family here after seeing photo after photo of burgers, hot dogs and fries being gobbled down here mostly by Yelper Khai. Also Yelper Jason's review intrigued me more to the point where I said to myself \"dammit I have to check this burger joint out\". How do I describe Tousignant? It's a local restaurant just on the edge of Marche Jean Talon. Burgers, roasted chicken, hot dogs and fries are the main focus of the menu. You enter the place climb up the stairs and have this delicious scent of flat top seared burgers. It's sensory overload. 

I ended up ordering the Tousignant burger w poutine. My mom would tell me to keep these meals to a minimum but it was crazy good. The burger had this delicious little crust and the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. It kind of reminds me of In N Out or a local version of Shake Shack but different. You see the reason I say this is they have this Tousignant sauce which is similar to the sauce at those two mentioned restaurants. It's like a thousand islands salad dressing and adds that special zip to the burgers that pretty much delivers where it should. The poutine was on point as well. I ordered the small and it came out as a huge serving in generous large sized bowl. Brown sauce, potatoes that are hand cut and a bit sweet it's a great accompaignant to a burger meal. 

My wife ordered a burger not knowing the Tousignant sauce was mayo based and mentioned she couldn't eat it. They gladly did her another (no charge). Very kind of them and excellent customer service. My daughter had a hot dog which was served with coleslaw and pickles. Everyone was super content. 

They have a draft tap for hopefully when they get their liquor licence. That day will hopefully come sometime soon. 

I'd agree with Jason. This place is a classic in the making!"}
{"text":"Nice burgers ! Went there with a large group and everybody loved it.

I had the Tousignant burger. Good enough if you have a normal/decent appetite. But if you are always hungry like me then you can safely accompany that with fries or even a poutine"}
{"text":"Le Meilleur cheeseburger de ma vie! WOW!
Five what???....., ;)

Franchement délicieux. J'ai aussi essayé le hot-dog.

Tout est fait maison ici et ça se goûte.

La poutine est très bonne mais nous avons moins aimé la sauce. Excellent fromage par contre.

J'adore!!!"}
{"text":"The interior immediately captures your attention with chrome, mirrors, huge vitrines and an ambiance reminiscent of an old diner, yet the music and the young staff break the charm. Overpriced, and a little scrambled, the service was friendly but the food was a bit uninspired and too salty. The poutine gravy was disappointing but the cheese curds were delicious. Custom touches and garnishes (like included sides such as pickles or coleslaw) would have improved the value. A tidy bathroom and fixed stools were a nice touch, but overall the experience left me wanting more. With a few improvements, they will secure themselves as the hippest casse croûte du quartier."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burgers in Montreal. My friend and I went here after a Yelp Elite event. Other Yelpers told us that they serve the best burgers here so why not?  I tried both the hot dog and the cheeseburger.  The hot dog was served with bacon, cheese and pickles and it was good.  However the portion was a bit small so I went for a second order and had the legendary cheeseburger and it blew my mind. It melted in my mouth and the beef patty was done just right (a little burnt on the grill which made it crunchy). A full burger would fill up one person for sure. I should've ordered the burger first. Next time I am going to go for the petit poutine which looked super good. 

During our Uber ride here, even the driver was aware of the popularity of this new location.  

My friend discovered that this spot was only opened for two months and it's so popular already - \"Instant success!\"  

Note the seats here weren't the most comfy and the wait time can be long if it is during busy hours.  With the amount of visitors,  they can easily expand it into a full restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fast food joints and wouldn't rate them five stars, but Chez Tousignant deserves its rating for what it is. Why I keep returning, because of the hotdog, which is the the tastiest I have ever, ever had, the hotdog itself, the homemade bun, the coleslaw are perfect. It is so tasty that I haven't bothered yet to try their burgers. Their poutine competes with some of the best examples of this classical Quebec dish in Montreal, the paprika adds and extra flavour. Combined with the fact they have two beers on tap, there is no reason not to grab a hotdog and share poutine with a friend in Chez Tousignant while visiting Little Italy and surroundings. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is gonna be short and sweet.

Back in the 80s a comedian kvetching about the price of hotel coffee said that for 17$ for a lot of coffee, that he wants Juan Valdez and his f'ing mule to deliver it to his room. 

So at 11$ for a cheeseburger, I want my head to explode like in Scanners. 

Well they brought their A game. Everything is made on site. Winners, buns, pickles, etc. The fries are awesome soft greasy fries that beg for salt and vinegar. The cheeseburger was a watershed moment. No, really. Potato buns, beefy beef patties with the perfect amount of crustyness on the edges, super cheesy cheese, the right amount of toppings served while still as hot as the griddle it was made on. Oh and did I mention the milkshakes that go down so fast you forgot to stop...

I also got a few bites of the hot dog's and wooooooooooow. Snappy wieners that challenges Chez Ma Tante's as the top dog in Montréal. Next time I try the hot dog, the corn dog and the poutine. 

Its gonna cost you but its gonna be worth it. 5 outta 5."}
{"text":"OMG. OMG. This is heaven for me. I love all kinds of food but Poutine is my weakness. The detail and effort from Gema and Impasto but in our favorites - gourmet casse-croute. Now that is what I'm talking about. If you don't get it, stop and read Hoang-Khai review and hear the music. I was so excited to try this out when I first heard about it. Now I can't get it out of my head. The Chef Yann Turcotte is a great guy. He loves to cook and he loves making amazing simple but good quality casse-croute food.  And here they do everything from scratch, Yann took the time to tell us how the meat in the burgers is fresh, direct and good cuts of meat. Same meat from the burgers are used for their hand made hot dogs. Did you hear me? OMG Home made bread, dessert...everything except the ketchup. It is a must try and likely a try again and again."}
{"text":"Glad to say to finally tried this place out today for lunch! The line already started and it was 11:45. The line can get long but the service is fairly quick, those guys are slinging burgers and dogs like true masters. I give those guys full points. They work like a well oiled machine.

Okay so the  layout is pretty cool, it has an old diner feel with some new age  here and there which gives it a sleek look. I just wish it was a little bit bigger it can get cramped on there but hey! The foods the real star here

Okay so I took the simple burger with all the fixins and a French fry. Wanted to eat light lol. So the bun was fantastic. Home made actually. And the burger patty was thin and tasted fantastic I love how there are some burnt bits it's a real contrast of textures on the burger. Very good. My only regret is not taking a double! Lol okay so the French fries were also very good. Old school casse croutes style. A little greasy but that's what makes here great! I would definite go back. Going to try there rootbeer beer and maybe even a doughnut"}
{"text":"I'm not going to try and out do anyone on this review. How could I since I've only tried the classic dog? That being a $5 one, and ate it while walking and talking in the cold. Needless to say I had to get it down before it became cold and lost the crispness of the toasted bun and warm to cool experience of the toppings to steamed larger than typical elongated meat roll. It's no all beef job, but then that wouldn't be considered classic. While waiting for my quick snack I took in the ambiance, and there is a lot of it. A very 50s black and white vibe. The pie under glass thing, the old school menu fonts and signage. Counter stools and friendly banter.

I'll be back to try what I've been told by some pros is a heck of a burger and poutine. Looked good on the tables around, but then again I also saw a lot of wrapper balled up and empty pop bottles. More tasting and slurping needed, and I'm pretty sure they'll ramp up to 5 right quick, and I'll get more of a grasp why the prices are a fair bit more than the many corner casse-croûtes en ville (snack bars in town). 

Honestly, writing this is making me want to go eat there 5 out of 6 days like another reviewer."}
{"text":"After hearing that Michele Forgione and Stefano Faita were opening up a casse-croute I was excited to see what a more upscale version of this Quebec symbol would be like.  For those of you who are scratching their heads when they see the word casse-croute it basically refers to a snack bar.  They tend to be small, local spots where you can grab a cheap and greasy meal.  

I thought that since Chez Tousignant was generating so much buzz it was best to come on a weekday at lunch when it might be quieter but it must always be busy because when I showed up most of the seats were occupied and shortly after I placed my order a long line formed.  I can imagine that on weekends it would be a zoo.  Let me tell you that there is a good reason for these crowds.  

Lunch for me was a cheeseburger and poutine.  Everything is made fresh to order here and you can see them in the kitchen working hard to make sure your food gets to you quickly.  I sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen and the staff were working constantly.  As a consequence I didn't have to wait long at all (maybe a little more than five minutes tops).

That cheeseburger is just out of this world delicious.  They use 100 % local beef beef chuck and it was grilled to perfection.  The exterior of the patty was slightly charred and crispy while the inside was so juicy.  From my understanding they even make their own buns here so these potato buns are fresh and of very high calibre.  They are toasted to have just the right amount of crunch on the outside while still being soft and chewy on the inside.  The burger is garnished with their signature Tousignant sauce which I'm pretty sure is mayo-based and adds a nice touch to it.

Now you can't bill yourself as a casse-croute and not serve a good poutine.  That would be sacrilege.  The poutine here is just the right balance of fries, curds and gravy.  That gravy was velvety and well-balanced in flavour.  If you're getting something like a burger or hot dog then play it safe and get a small poutine since it is more than enough.  I struggled to finish the small one after the cheeseburger.  The large would be good if that is all you plan to eat.

The price tag might seem excessive to some people at first glance.  A cheeseburger, poutine and ginger ale set me back $20.  At the same time we're not talking your average burger joint here.  They are using such high quality ingredients and putting so much labour into the final product that it will be more expensive then your typical neighbourhood casse-croute.  But you know what?  It will also taste a lot better."}
{"text":"I've got an eye on at this location for awhile now and I finally went.
The poutine is okay, would prefer the fries to be more crispy but hey, it taste very good still.
I must say, their cheese burger is the absolute high light. Toasted buns, very tasty beef patty, it'd just amazing.
I find it a bit over price for the type food and service they provide (counter order, fast food style) but it's a clean area, great neighbourhood with great food!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night. We shared the cheeseburger, the Tousignant hot dog and the regular small poutine, We left feeling full. The burger was good but next time I want to try the Tousignant burger.

As for the hot dog, I never had cheese and pickles on a hot dog before but it was so tasty! Both the burger and the hot dog were juicy and flavorful. 

The poutine however was just ok. Nothing special. I've had better poutine elsewhere. The fires were good and they put a lot of cheese which I liked. I think its the sauce I wasn't crazy about. 

The diner is cute. They played 80s music when we went. The food is fairly inexpensive and the service was quick. 

After reading all the reviews on yelp and hearing my friends talk about this diner, I think my expectations were just too high going in. It was good but it wasn't amazing. I felt like it was far to drive all the way from downtown for some fast food. However, if you are in the neighborhood and are craving fast food I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Super fast food, le tout était excellent, le resto est à la hauteur de la renommée du proprio. Super ambiance jeunes même à 2200. Bec cola une belle révélation"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh,homemade & local! and I mean everything!!! Very rare to have a fast food joint that strides on quality & taste. Montreal was definitely in need of such a place! ABSOLUTELY MUST TRY the Tousignant hotdog! You won't regret it. Prices might seem high but once you bite into all that goodness you will understand!"}
{"text":"Ma copine m'avait dit que les burgers de chez Tousignant étaient super bons, je lui ai dit: ''Yeah right, on verra bien quand j'y serais allé pour les goûter'', lol ! Alors, nous y sommes allés par un samedi en fin d'après-midi et franchement, wow, mon cheeseburger (7,50$) était parfait, la boulette, le pain, etc. Les frites (3$) étaient croustillantes. J'ai adoré mon expérience, que ce soit au niveau de la bouffe, mais aussi au niveau de la décoration de ce ''diner'' chic/classique/moderne, avec son comptoir, ses chaises hautes tournantes, la céramique, les luminaires.... Bravo ! Le chef Yann Turcotte était au fourneaux. Service rapide à la caisse pour commander. Prix abordables et raisonnables. Un win-win si vous voulez manger gras mais bon et de qualité dans Villeray. Oui, on reviendra essayer d'autres choses sur leur menu (poutine / hot-dog /...). À la fin, la caissière et le chef, nous ont remerciés et salués à notre départ. Si tous les restaurants/commerces pourraient faire ainsi en étant aimables avec ses clients. 

5/5 visité en septembre 2016"}
{"text":"Je suis satisfaite du repas que j'y ai partagé avec mes amis, mais je n'y retournerai pas, parce que le prix demandé est disproportionné par rapport à certains choix du menu. Pour ma part, j'ai commandé un sandwich BLT qui était très bien garni et goûteux, mais le hot-dog, par exemple, n'a impressionné personne.

Ceci dit, je pense que leurs boissons gazeuses faites maison sont très bien, et les bouteilles en verre étaient jolies. Si vous visitez le marché Jean-Talon et que vous êtes en quête d'un rafraîchissement sucré, je vous conseillerais d'y entrer pour prendre une de ces boissons pour emporter. Vous pourrez par la même occasion apprécier le décor qui est charmant et rétro et qui vaut le coup d'oeil."}
{"text":"Todays special: Chez Tousignant. After a night of drinking recommended. My personal recommendation is the Cherry Soda made in house and the double cheese burger with the special Tousignant sauce."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with Impasto and frankly, I really disliked Gema... Sorry, it's just my taste. So I went to Tousignant expecting to hate it. I was so very wrong! It is great!

The homemade hotdogs, the homemade bread, burgers.... Everything is excellent. I didn't enjoy the doughnut, but then again I'm not crazy about caky doughnuts. The pie looked yummy.

The quality of the food is fabulous... Montreal really needed this type of gourmet fast food!

I don't understand the comments about the prices. It's expensive, but I expect to pay those prices for food that's made from scratch. In fact, given the quality and the work involved, the prices are more than reasonable.

Service (cashier) was super friendly."}
{"text":"Chez Tousignant is a great lunch spot close to Jan Talon market. There's hot dogs, burgers, and poutine, and that's about it. That being said, the food is top shelf. Hot Dogs are home-made, and maybe the best I've had. The burgers are great too, especially the Tousignant burger with maple bacon. Their homemade donuts are pretty good too.

The only downside are the fries. They're too starchy and not crispy enough. Not sure if it's an issue with frying temperature or the type of potato but the fries were the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review."}
{"text":"I pigged out here today! It was really good stuff and it really hit the spot. I really liked the burger. You can taste the quality even if it's junk food. It really tasted homemade which is a good thing. Give this a try if you need a junk food cheat day fix. I felt like in the ending of the movie Harold & Kumar go to White Castle. Really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and helpful so I obtained a brief description of each item on the menu before proceeding to order. 

I had the tousignant cheese burger, michigan hotdog, fries, and an evergreen soda.

The TOUSIGNANT Cheeseburger is reaaal good (4.5/5)... especially for a burger cooked on a hot plate. The flavours of the ham, onion, cheese, sauce, and patty came together very well. 

They make their own ground chuck, wieners, and bread (wut). The only thing they don't make are the cheese curds and Heinz dressings (obviously). 

Front desk described the 'tousignant' sauce to be similar to the big mac sauce, but superior because of the high quality ingredients that go into it. 

The rest well... were underwhelming.
Michigan hotdog (average tasting, terrible for 7$ before taxes) consists of a buttered and toasted hotdog bun with a homemade wiener that tastes like the ones sitting on the shelves of supermarkets, a homemade bland tomato meat sauce, and locally made cheese curds.

The fries (3$, not a lot) are the type that native quebecers would enjoy: fluffy on the inside, greasy, and not crispy at all. The fries are brown and a bit black which suggests overcooking at low temperature.

The soda that tastes like evergreen (3.50$) was particular. It's a good alternative to root beer sodas in my opinion, except I don't pay 3.50$ for a bottle of root beer, so why should I pay 3.50$ for an evergreen-flavoured soda?

Overall, the experience has been pleasant in my mouth, but it's a whole other story for my credit card. That's the main reason I give this place an overall of 3/5 -- no hot dog of that size is worth 7$."}
{"text":"Good food but way too expensive. Almost twice as much as anywhere else you can get a good burger. This is a fast food place like \"La Belle Province\" but they charge the price of high-end restaurants with table service."}
{"text":"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to make a good burger, yet just a handful of places actually know how! Chez Tousignant knows that the secret is in the quality of ingredients. Fairly pricy, but who can blame them - get that money yo! The bread they use is truly unique. The fries and milkshakes are just ok, but the burgers is certainly worth it."}
{"text":"In Quebec, the casse-croute is a tradition. That little neighbourhood joint where you get a nice simple breakfast, a greasy lunch, dinner or even just a coffee and a doughnut. Nowadays for most of us, we think of casse-croutes as those greasy spots by the highway or the Belle Province you go to grab a bit after a late night outing. Not exactly the highest of quality.

As an unabashed fan of Michele Forgione and Stefano Faita - and their drive to make everything homemade within their restaurants GEMA and Impasto - All the \"test\" pictures of burgers, bread, hot dogs and doughnuts that Michele has been posting on Instagram for the past year or so have been killing me. When would we be getting this ideal old school casse-croute? Finally, just prior to the holidays, it finally arrived: Chez Tousignant run by Impasto's previous chef de cuisine (and originator of the idea) Yann Turcotte. I was away for 2 weeks but as soon as I came back, it was clear that I needed to finally satisfy the cravings from all those pictures.

Located on Drolet near the Jean Talon market, Chez Tousignant has a great old school diner look - the neon sign in front, the ceramic tiled floor, the metal-topped tables and counters, the stools. Everything even down to the menu signs fits the old style.

Foodwise, this is a casse-croute through and through. On my first visit, I went classic - a Michigan hot dog and some fries. The fries were great - as you need at a diner - but right now, we NEED to focus on that hot dog. Homemade all-beef dog. Homemade potato bun. Topped with homemade meat sauce and cheese curds. Good lord this thing was amazing. Officially the best hot dog I have ever had and it's not even close. The all-natural beef frank is such a change from the usual industrial variety. Cooked on the griddle, it had a nice crunch to it while still having a nice tender texture inside. And that bun..... oh that bun. Man, they nailed it. When you add the buttered grilling on the griddle, that dense yet soft bun gets a nice rich crunch to it. Rare is the time where one hot dog would fill me up but this one hit the spot. When you're doing hot dogs with ingredients with this quality, that's what you get apparently.

The second time around, I went for some other classic casse-croute staples - cheeseburger and poutine. The cheeseburger - served with special sauce, lettuce, onion as well as tomato and pickle if you wish - was another hit for me. The potato bun was once again spectacular - god I need to learn to make these - with that same buttery goodness off the griddle. The meat was meaty with a nice crust, the cheese was nicely melted on-top and the sauce added a nice little creaminess. A classic yet spectacular burger.

The poutine was a beauty as well. First off, curds at the bottom. Not just on-top. Big hit with me. A very nice touch. Anyway, we've got here a generous portion of fries with plenty of curds and some amazing gravy. This wasn't some off the shelf St-Hubert gravy mix. So dark and rich, the gravy ties the whole thing together. It's amazing how given all the ways that people feel the need to dress up a poutine now if you just use the best elements, the classic one is simply the best.

On top of all this goodness, there is even more! Chez Tousignant also does a pie of the day and some doughnuts for dessert. I went with a doughnut because I couldn't resist the beautiful stack of doughnuts on-top of the counter. An old-fashion cake doughnut with a vanilla bean glaze. The doughnut itself was dense but nicely chewy - sweet with a touch of cinnamon. The glaze though was the impressive part to me. The vanilla bean came through nicely and the glaze was firm - no stickiness whatsoever - but cracked nicely once you bite into it.

Lastly, I went with a milkshake because of course I did. Chez Tousignant does chocolate or vanilla. I tried one of each on my two visits. Rich and smooth in both cases with nice deep flavour. You actually got chocolate or vanilla flavour - not just milk with a hint of either one.

Chez Tousignant was a blast in the past in the best way possible. A true casse-croute where care is taken to make everything homemade because that is how you provide the best to your clients. All through the process of testing, chef Forgione labeled all his pictures with #ParceQueVousLeMeritez - that's the essence of what Chef Turcotte and the Chez Tousignant team are about - it may be lots of work but as a client, you cannot help but appreciate the craftsmanship on display.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Je suis venue Chez Tousignant suite à une énorme pression sociale: tout le monde mais vraiment tout le monde, sauf moi, était venu manger chez Tousignant. Je suis tellement fière d'avoir été un mouton et d'avoir été une suiveuse: j'ai mangé le meilleur fast food de ma vie. Bon, j'en mange pas souvent donc quand je me lance j'aime que ça en vaille la peine. Tout était à la hauteur: le  Resto comme tel est super sympathique avec une touche rétro. J'aime bien l'idée de partager une table avec des inconnus aussi. Le service était super sympathique et rapide. La bouffe! Miam! On a partagé une grosse Poutine à 3 et j'ai pris un cheeseburger. Quel cheeseburger!!! Le pain est vraiment bon: moelleux et un peu crispy en même temps, la galette de viande savoureuse, juteuse et bien grillée. La sauce était aussi très très bonne. La Poutine, classique, aussi était succulente. C'est clair qu'au prochain craving de fast food c'est Chez Tousignant que j'irai!"}
