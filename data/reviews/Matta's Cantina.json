{"text":"Unbelievable that the staff is too lazy to accommodate a party of 8. \"We are not going to accommodate you and I am not going to argue with you\" is something you should NEVER hear from management at a restaurant. I am absolutely floored by the condescending attitude of the manager and apparently the owner's son. They refused to put two tables together under the guise of a fire hazard.  Our group frequents east valley restaurants and usually with even larger parties. I can say for certain we will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"I love this place, food is great and service is awesome! The only complaint are the bar stools, made of rod iron and the most uncomfortable I have ever set on, maybe a foot rail would help!

Oh, also, I wish they would carry Grand Marnier and some other higher end items ( not as important)!"}
{"text":"Decor; good, atmosphere; good, bar; great, music selection was decent.  And yet...quesadilla with Kraft singles, Italian spaghetti sauce and jalapeños or some sort of concoction to make salsa, the server lacked the understanding of a veggie fajita and bordered on refusing to allow us to order them. She legit told me three times \"I'll be back with a water for you\" and I ended up getting my second refill only after my date got up to take our cups to the bar. Ended up with 2 good margaritas because the only one worth anything there was the bartender. Watched the owner/manager (not sure, dude in a suit) chug a corona behind the bar and then bus tables with the crew. It was so insane. There were a handful of tables full and a full bar with only 1 server and bar tender on staff. Bad nights happen but the food was bad. Drinks are good though. Enjoy it for its cantina."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for this afternoon for a big family birthday lunch, confirmed it yesterday over the phone and got there today to find a note on the door that the restaurant is closed! As in, CLOSED!! No phone call letting us know. Manager came out and said they hadn't known yesterday that the restaurant would be closing. We even watched an employee show up for shift and be told to go home! Sad and very poorly handled. Puts the Mattas restaurant name to shame."}
{"text":"Junk! Terrible service. Table was dirty, food was undercooked and tasted bland. Waited forever for our check. Just a terrible, terrible, experience. Save your money and eat a meal at home tonight, don't waste it here."}
{"text":"My wife and I gave them a try. It's close to our home and had hoped it would be great food.
The food was OK.  Not bad, not good.  The real issue was the lack of service.  My wife was tired of waiting and was ready to leave when the waitress arrived.  She apologized about the long wait time. It was nice of her to acknowledged that we had to wait for service.  I don't understand the delay since we were two out of the eight people in the restaurant.  
We had to ask about our drinks a couple times before they finally arrived.  The restaurant seemed to be well staffed. I just think the staff didn't want to be bothered with work.
If you go, I hope you have a better experience."}
{"text":"Worst meal ever!!! I've eaten at a lot of places in my life and this hands down was awful!!!"}
{"text":"We live so close by, but because of the horrible review we almost didn't come. All I can assume,  is somebody was a real grump and hit the place during opening week. What a pleasant surprise, the wait staff was friendly and fun, the food exceeded our expectations, best guacamole and Chili Relleno (and we've lived and traveled to many cities). The house Margarita was really good. Overall a great and needed addition to east Mesa. We will be back weekly!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!! Been here 3 X thinking it will get butter but nope! The food takes forever! Do the owners even read this?????"}
{"text":"When you walk into a restaurant that has approximately 10 people sitting down eating, and the first thing your server says is \"omg it's so crazy in here tonight!  We've been having some issues\"...just leave.  Don't stay and try to get your server to understand the concept of veggie fajitas.  Don't wait THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF YOUR MEAL for a water refill (3 times we asked!!).  Don't order the fajitas, which come out as practically raw vegetables, some shredded velveeta cheese, and 3 tortillas to split between two people.  Don't pay $44 for some of the worst food and worst service you've ever experienced...just go to the bar and order a cheap but delicious margarita, have a laugh at the sad state of affairs this restaurant finds itself in, and leave.  The manager (owner?) couldn't even pick up on our disappointment, and didn't notice (or maybe didn't care) about our permanently empty water glasses.  Everyone makes mistakes, I understand...for instance, mine was eating here tonight.  NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I wish there were an option for ZERO STARS. the service is the WORST!!! We waited 45  minutes before anyone took our order!!! We went for happy hour and ended up missing it because we didn't \"put our order in on time\" total bull sh*t... We complained got nothing. We asked for a manager and there wasn't one available!!! We only go for drinks now."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have ever experienced here in Arizona. Several tables were not bussed the whole time we were in the restaurants and guests were leaving due to there not being seated or they were told they could seat themselves (at dirty tables). If they sat themselves, they sat at their table for several minutes with dirty dishes and old food sitting on their table, while the waitresses walked passed and avoided eye contact. There were three waitresses and they made up excuses as to why the tables weren't cleaned even though they could have taken dishes back instead of walking to the kitchen empty handed. 

Two guests ended up waiting at the registers to pay because their checks never came (after being requested). 

The food was good, but the service was extremely poor and the lack of management/extremely low expectations and training was very obvious."}
{"text":"The food is great BUT twice now I've been in there and there has been a horrible sewer back up smell at the Ellsworth and Brown location.  Not their fault it's the building.  You can't enjoy a meal in that environment."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for anyone who loves Mexican food and/or just a good neighborhood bar/restaurant vibe. We live within walking distance of Matta's and hope to contribute to their success. A bar tucked away from the city and the \"hustle and bustle\" requires a lot more love and support. With that being said, the exterior at times could appear to look closed simply because of the position the building faces. The dark blacked out tint sometimes makes me question if they're open for business, but don't let that sway you. It's just a little deceiving at first. We are always greeted by a friendly face and a welcome back. If you live in the area, or are in the area, please check Matta's out. The Taco Trio and Sandy's burrito are to die for. Not to mention their house margaritas are yum. I can honestly say that each and every time is a good time. Whether it is just good eats that leads to good conversation; we are often times walking out with full bellies, (a buzz), and a couple new friends. That's really all you can ask for from a good ol' neighborhood bar. Give these guys a shot. You'll enjoy it. We sure do."}
{"text":"Sat there for 17 minutes not one person acknowledged us.
 One person working and was running around like a chicken with her head cut off. This was our second visit the first was horrible had to wait 45 minutes for the wrong meal thought we would give it another try NEVER will we be back!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been here twice. It's close by our house so we are going to keep going but we won't be ordering food. We've tried the Mexican and the burgers and both are subpar at best. We won't be ordering food again. We went yesterday and had to wait for service while the waitress finished her cigarette right outside the front door. Both times the staff seemed more interested in hanging out at a table than actually helping the customers. The only exception to this is Mark who is on top of it and the only one who seems to do anything. If we had any other options as close as Matta's is we would go there instead. Maybe they'll get better the longer they're open."}
{"text":"We have been fans of Matta's for years, and we had a great experience. Our server, Derrick, was wonderful... very attentive and friendly and we didn't have to ask for anything. Everything was very clean and the on-duty management was accessible and friendly. Also, clean restrooms which I very much appreciate."}
