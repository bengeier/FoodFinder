{"text":"An awesome hidden gem in Streetsboro with great food at great prices. Definitely check this out."}
{"text":"Great find in Streetsboro!! Food was terrific and prices are very reasonable!! Lots of choices for specials of the day and our waitress very attentive and friendly. We will definitely be going back to this little gem!!"}
{"text":"This place is really small inside and they don't do reservations, so know that going in. I imagine in spring and summer when the golfers are in full swing, no pun intended, that you wouldn't get a table for hours. The bar also takes up half of the space, with high tops for 2 across from it. 

I went with my husband and father in law and none of us had ever been. He said friends recommended the pork chop. I'm not huge on chops, and it's not something I'd typically order out. My husband got the whiskey pasta dish and practically licked his plate clean. I didn't even get a bite so I can't comment much on that. I got the fried fish and was nervous because you never know how fried it'll come. Luckily, it was breaded super lightly, seasoned well, and not the least but greasy. Delicious! I was disappointed in the baked potato. It was luke warm and I picture them all sitting in a big tray in the back wrapped in foil in an attempt to keep warm after baking hours ago. It also came with a packet of sour cream to squirt on, which seemed a little off given the atmosphere of The rest of the dining experience. 

My father in law got the pork chops and I had some food envy for sure. Not one but two chops pounded so thin I couldn't believe it, with gravy on top and mashed potatoes. He also cleared his plate so I can't vouch for the taste, but if I returned, I'd go chops for sure."}
{"text":"On our way from Youngstown to Cleveland, we asked Siri for restaurants near us and the Whiskey Barrel Lodge came up.  After a short but tortuous drive through the back roads of Ohio, we finely arrive at restaurant. It's actually a golf course restaurant. 

I had the Caesar salad with chicken, price was only $8 bucks for lunch, great deal. However; the salad was drenched in salad dressing. It comes pre-mix in, but there was so much of it, it was inedible. I ended up just eating the chicken, which I was dipping in my salad."}
{"text":"The gyro meet is so fresh, tender, plentiful, and delicately spiced. Portions so large will have leftovers for a couple meals! Pretty good Draft selection. Orchard, blue moon, truth, glb, and staples. Many in bottles. Servers lunch everyday and has children's menu. Nice fireplace for cold weather and great outdoor patio! Also pro/gift shop attached."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance and a beautiful outdoor patio on a golf course setting.  Never been disappointed in a meal there and honestly the best steak in town."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the atmosphere is beautiful! Wish the booths has a little more space."}
{"text":"This restaurant is owned by the same people who own the Dolphin Restaurant in Macedonia. The menu is completely different than the previous owners when it was The Lodge Taproom and Grille (I have it 3 stars). We live right around the corner and went here with our neighbors because they heard nothing but good things. The food was as expected, delicious. My calamari was flavorful. I had the fried Walleye, a huge piece, with browned potatoes (grilled JoJos with olive oil and herbs) and a side salad with homemade blue cheese dressing. My husband had the ribs. He said were good and he loved there mozzarella wedges. The gyro looked good as well as the Cobb salad. I would've taken pics, but didn't want to be rude with our guest. I did take pics of the take out menu because you can't get it on their website. They need to work on that. Our waitress was pleasant."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week to give it a try.  Nice decor and a big enough space for what is needed.  It is attached to a golf course, so I am sure that helps to bring in people after a round.  

Beer selection was decent.  Nothing to write home about.  Lots of choices for food.  Some smaller bites and some larger plates.  I went with an open faced roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes.  It was very good overall.  Just a little too salty on the gravy from me.  It certainly was enough food to fill you up.  The best part.  It was 8 dollars!!!  Way worth that money."}
{"text":"First time to dine at The Whiskey Barrel Lodge.  I picked it because of all the great reviews.  I would not give it a 4 or 5 star rating.  Nice restaurant, clean, waitress was ok not the best.  Had to ask for little things such as water or bread.  I got the salmon, kinda hard to screw this dish up.  It was good.  My side was a baked potato.  My first potato wasn't even warm, second one to come out was warm but not hot.  My husband got the ribs, they were tough.  We decided we would give it another try and see if we have better luck next time."}
{"text":"Located at a golf course, Came here because I'm on a work trip and it was down the road from our hotel. This place didn't disappoint. Very clean inside. Bartenders were super nice, drinks are reasonably priced. And the food, my goodness, the French cut pork chop ($15) was the best pork chop I had ever had. That is a $50+ priced meal at any steakhouse. They have a golf league menu that I looked at and everything looked reasonably priced. Burgers $7.00 and they were big, wings looked good for $6.00. I would definitely recommend coming here if your in the area!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food service and prices. Don't waste your time at fast food overpriced places.  Get good food great prices"}
{"text":"Passing through town looking for a nice place for dinner. Saw this place on yelp. Off the beaten path but well worth the extra 5 minutes to get there. Great menu, great food and service at reasonable prices. Wish I lived closer as we would be regulars."}
{"text":"First time there and the menu was large with the specials. Huge portions and tasty food. The staff was fun and helpful. Will be a hotspot!"}
{"text":"I live very close so I eat here a lot. The food is always excellent, and the prices are very reasonable. They even have decent wine and beer selections. It's beautiful and very clean; it has all the potential of a higher end restaurant, but they kind of run it like a family restaurant (Streetsboro has enough of those). They do tend to run out of food quite a bit; I've had to change my order several times because they are out of something - not a huge deal, there are plenty of good choices. My concern with this restaurant is that they randomly close early, so you can't count on eating there even during the advertised open hours. That has caused me to just go somewhere else at times instead of taking the chance. The other problem is that when it gets close to closing time, all of the employees start cleaning up around you, making you feel rushed and uncomfortable. It's worth eating there - but it's probably best to call first to see if they're actually open, and get there early enough so they aren't pushing you out."}
{"text":"First visit to this FABULOUS restaurant. Can't say enough good things about this \"hidden gem\"! Alex was our server. Great guy. Personable, helpful, attentive & all around good server. Food was so tasty & served very \"appetizingly\". ( not  a word ). Would recommend this restaurant to everyone. Will go back next week.  Thank you all for a great dining experience. The Perks"}
