{"text":"They have some delicious mulitas!!! I've been coming here for over a decade and the last 2 times I had bad experience . The first time was they but way too much ice on my raspado and charged me extra for additional fruit and they didn't put the extra fruit . Btw everything is expensive here which I don't mind paying . I came another time after that and the pineapple was bitter, the mango was old and squishy and the strawberries were sour , I am so disappointed . Their raspado game is weak now . So I will be looking for a new raspado place . But I will still keep coming for the food"}
{"text":"Very good variety of products BUT such a bad service!! I really want to go back and get some raspados and tosti-nachos but then i think that i have to wait about 15 min to order (even if there are just two customers in front of me) or deal with the grumpy owner. No way!"}
{"text":"A F***ing cockroach came out of the taco! and it started running around the table,"}
{"text":"The store has a wide variety of Mexican candy but it's super over priced. The drinks and raspados are almost flavor less."}
{"text":"My favorite little hole in the wall Mexican spot for everything I could possibly crave. I live on opposite side of town but I always come back for more from here. Very friendly owner and great food."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best tosti-elotes in town!!! The store has a wide variety of Mexican candy and snacks!!! Definitely coming back!!!  The only downside was that I didn't get the Tazo that comes in the Tostitos bag. I was looking forward to battling my friends with it."}
{"text":"Bad service, workers are always grumpy. There is no organization to ordering, I went and ordered one thing and he came out and gave me something I had not ordered, when I told him I had not ordered that, they told me that I was wrong and thats what I had ordered, then another lady told me it wasn't fair for them to give me what I truly had ordered because it would make their money go to waste! Never going again. I couldn't do much more after that since they don't have any type of receipts or anything."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Mexican cuisine in the heart of North Las Vegas, look no further than Raspados Playas. A spanish-speaking friend brought me here, and it's a good thing, because if you don't have a translator (or speak spanish yourself), you may encounter a language barrier. Most likely, though, you would be able to order your food without a problem.   I had the carnitas burrito, which was the size of my head -- huge! Most importantly, not only was it big, it was tasty. I managed to pack away the entire thing, and didn't encounter a single fatty piece of meat. Since the burrito was so large though, it would have been nice to have it served on a plate instead of in a basket, so that cutting it with a knife and fork would have been easier.  I like my food spicy, and that was no problem here -- make sure to have a roasted jalape√±o or two! Unfortunately, I also enjoy washing down my spicy food with a cold beer, but that was not possible, because Raspados Playas doesn't sell beer."}
