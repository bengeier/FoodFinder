{"text":"Food was spoil and the owner was rude and didn't refund or replace it. Don't ever eat from this place. The don't care about their customers. The Owner has no manners or respect. I think the health department should pay this place a visit."}
{"text":"The food is not that great. Service is real poor, I went there with my sister to eat all you can eat take out, and they approach us to take our bag from us. They said when taken the food, you should be able to close the plate. So what do they mean by all you can eat take out? We ask for our money back and all they said was no refund. The servers were really rude in all their action."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Made quick and tastes Ã¼ber Delish. Favourite dishes to order spicy crab, spicy shrimp and Vegetable rice. Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall, park up to the restaurant and avoid paying for the use of the parking lot (up to one hour).   Greeted by a bar top when you walk in, wasn't sure if this was the right place.  Quickly seated as we walked around the buffet serving area at a nice table by the windows.  Ambiance was complemented by loud \"island\" style remakes of pop songs.  Made for a relaxed dining atmosphere.   Red Stripe was a bit expensive, however was offset when paired with my two spicy fried lobsters for $18.99 (also available prepped with ginger or black bean sauce). I wanted the same special with Vancouver crabs, but was told it was only lobsters that day.   Tasted great, could have pre-cracked a few more of the lobster bits though.   Also tried the Caribbean style lomein.  Unless you consider the extra chicken Caribbean, it is a Chinese dish with a slightly different sauce.    Come for the seafood and expect a twist on Chinese, but not necessarily island flavors.  Great value for the price, will definitely be back to try the crabs."}
{"text":"Great food and cheaply priced. I ordered the Singapore noodles with chicken and a few other dishes. Each item was cooked and spiced perfectly. A meal for 3 people came out to $36 with a lot of left overs that lasted 3 days. I would highly recommend this place for delivery. They do have an online menu... I have never been to the restaurant so I can't content on their decor. Their food satisfied a picky child and husband."}
{"text":"Good portion sizes but food taste is lacking. I went from regular diner to occasional to not at all. Busy little place but truly no frills. In the islands this would be a rum shop that serves food instead of a restaurant that serves booze."}
{"text":"I dont think anyone who has eaten this food has ever not eaten it again. Spicy shrimp is a toronto treasure. Good value for giant portions! Buffet at lunch...a la carte for dinner and they deliver..no complaints!"}
{"text":"Usually come in for the lunch special which is pretty good and economically priced.    Food is pretty good, has like a Chinese/Guyanese twist to it.. not sure. . Cut most comparable to Hakka cuisine.    Once you get past the somewhat rude waitress you will find that it is a pretty good place to come once in awhile.    Lunch special includes all you can eat hot and sour soup, varieties of cooked chicken,  rice, noodles, and much more."}
{"text":"Look - this place is $8 for lunch, taxes in. So don't get your hopes up. Nor should you be expecting to find much Caribbean food, whatever that nebulous term means. It's essentially a cheap Chinese buffet (you know, sweet and sour chicken, black pepper beef and other things you'ld only eat after 3 beers) that happens to have goat curry and plain roti available. Make sense?  Nearby Brar Sweets (Albion and Islington) - which offers a vegetarian thali - is just as insanely cheap and miles better."}
{"text":"Went to the one at Albion Centre for take out. Everyone enjoyed. Got the 5 people special.  Will return."}
{"text":"Eww stay away if you value your health. Slippery disgusting tasteless meat.  The food tastes reheated all the time.  The girl who works there answering the phone for take out is pretty rude too.  I got delivery and the driver forgot to bring the interract machine so i had to go to the bank to get the money so what was the point of me getting delivery???? Albion malls location by far is better."}
{"text":"Love the food here. If you order take out over a certain amount, you get free items with your order. Very good food"}
{"text":"We drove around looking for this place for a little while. The issue was the sign was off outside thus it was making it rather difficult to find for the first time. Walked into the restaurant right into a bar stool, because that is where the bar is located in a tight walkway.   They were closing soon but the guy behind the bar took our order anyways. We ordered the chili chicken with fried rice and sweet and sour pork with steam rice. It came out quickly and we brought it home to eat. When we got home and unpacked it was interesting to see.  Chili Chicken - it was packed full! Lots of flavours it was good. Sweet and Sour Pork - It looked like it was just left overs thrown on steam rice and some sauce tossed on top.  Overall, it did it's job we were hungry and then we were fed. Oh by the way they aren't open until 1am. They're open until midnight on some nights..."}
{"text":"$12 for a lunch buffet how could you go wrong!! Great small buffet. 1 table long of selection ranging from breaded shrimp, goat curry, noodles, fried rice, chicken wings, sweet and sour chicken, vegetable spring rolls, Bbq chicken and watermelon. Hot sauce is hot but so gooooood!!!  Parking- pay for parking out front in a few spots. Park right in front of the restaurant and it's free!!   Would definitely come back for a lunch buffet again. :)"}
{"text":"If you love cheap eats, you will love this place. If you wanna go somewhere fancy smanshy and expect a more formal atmosphere this is not the place for you. Caribbean Heat is run by some very down to earth and funny people.  I came by here after work one evening with my aunt. We had shrimp wanton soup, chicken chow mein and spicy shrimp. The first surprise was the portion sizes. There was enough food to easily feed 3 people. You know when you go to a restaurant and order a shrimp dish and you can literally count how many shrimps there are? Well you won't be doing this here. The spicy shrimp weren't actually spicy- more like plump deep fried shrimps, the shrimp wanton soup was large enough for two and had a slight  taste of seasame oil,  the chicken chow mein was just really good chowmein topped with chicken that was moist ont he inside and crispy on the outside.    I may be a bit bias because I love Caribbean Chinese food, it is my favourite kind of chinese food. So if you are a fan as well this place is definitely worth checking out. They make amazing hot sauce as well for all my lovers of heat."}
{"text":"Tried this place as my mom friends kept recommending. Food was okay and they have a lot of main dishes to try from."}
{"text":"Amazing doesn't get any better for this price. I've been eating this for the last 10 years. Fast, cheap, and delicious. Customer service is not that good but the food is too good but if you're someone that the customer service affects. Then it would be a 4 star."}
{"text":"Its a no nonsense cheap food restaurant. I go for fine dining and i also went to this place. I know what i am paying for so i like this place for what they promise. I LOVE their deep fired wings with \"their\" hot sauce. It is delicious and they are very generous with their portions. All sorts of people come here so don't expect it to be quiet in any way. I mostly do a \"takeout\" to get my meal and enjoy it at home in peace and quiet with family and a movie."}
{"text":"crazy good Caribbean food here, which has slowly become a staple for me and my teammates at work. the hot sauce is absolutely amazing as well and is a must for anything that you order here.  they do offer a delivery service for the area as well.  very very happy.  would go out of my way to eat here!"}
