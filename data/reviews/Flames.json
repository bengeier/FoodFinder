{"text":"It's a take away... food is what you expect. Reasonably priced with plenty to choose from but there is only one friendly guy :) Everybody else seems like they don't want to be there!"}

{"text":"As I entered Flames at 2am on Sunday morning,through the smog in my brain caused by 8 hours of Newcastle Brown Ale abuse,I realized that not only had it been 17 years since I was last in there,it would also be the first time I had actually eaten any of their wares.  Back in the mid 90's I spent pretty much every weekend in Scarborough because the future Mrs Z was studying there,and most saturday nights she and her friends would go and get their tea from there before hitting the pubs. I on the other hand am one of those people who doesn't like a belly full of food before filling it up even more with booze,so because of that,even though I had been in there about a dozen times I had never actually eaten anything.  Being the drunken bums that we are,we opted for our go to staple,a pepperoni pizza and a garlic bread. Just before the guy boxed the pizza up he asked if we would like extra garlic. I never need to be asked twice if I want extra garlic. The guy then dipped a little brush in to a vat of melted garlic butter and proceeded to lovingly paint my pizza into a disc of orgasmic garlic perfection,he then did the same to the garlic bread! It doesn't get any better than that.  When it came to eating it,not only was it garlicky enough to decimate several Transylvanian villages but the pepperoni was beautiful too,I have never had a take-away pizza like it before.If I had been served it in a resaurant then It would've been the place in the world!  I am reliably informed that their burgers at top quality too,especially the,yep you guessed it,Garlic Burger......  Oh Flames,why the hell do you have to be 104 miles from my house?"}
