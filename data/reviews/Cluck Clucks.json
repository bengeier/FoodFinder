{"text":"Have only tried the fried chicken so far but has been so crispy, so juicy and moist every time so far that for the fried chicken (and the slaw which was good too), this I think is the best I've had in a long time. Even better than Chicken and Waffle places I've tried in the States. Surprising for such a simple hole-in-the-wall (but very clean and modern store)."}
{"text":"Excellent. Chicken is cooked to perfection. Juicy and crispy. Sides are great. Excellent value as well. Both the sweet and savory waffles were amazing. Going to be back often."}
{"text":"I loved the \"Mutha Cluckah\" very much, crispy outside tender inside very fresh and good prices too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and the owner was very nice to us. The chicken and waffles way surpassed my expectations. I ordered the 3 piece bone in chicken with jalapeño and cheddar waffle topped off with sweet heat syrup and it was incredible. Definitely worth the 5 star review reasonable pricing and large portions!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I can't believe I found a place to order Chicken and Waffles via Foodora that are so amazing! Delicious chicken and light fresh waffles every time! This has become a staple option for my husband and I."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path but what a find. Great food and great service. The Cluck yea was incredible. The flavours are all in point and the chicken is not greasy at all for being fried. I will definitely be back and look forward to them growing their business through various channels (Ritual, Google, Uber eats, etc.)."}
{"text":"I love this place. When I'm in the middle of a paper or when I'm home sick this is my go-to. The Holy Cluck cinnamon waffles are ridiculously good and these guys give you real maple syrup to go with it.

4/5 instead of 5/5 because I've had inconsistencies with the fried chicken and I honestly wish they were more breaded, but that being said it's freaking delicious. The portions of chicken aren't skimpy either.  You get what you pay for here and you don't pay too much. In fact I'd argue it's great price for value. Also usually pretty moist so I can't really complain"}
{"text":"Super moist, flavorful and crispy chicken. Probably the best fried chicken I've ever had. I had the What the Cluck 2 pc bone-in chicken with the jalapeno waffle with maple syrup.  2 juicy thighs on a spicy waffle. Not greasy like fast food chicken...more on par with the fried chicken served at restaurants. Waffle was fluffy as well. 

Limited seating inside...fast food type joint. 
For some reason the chicken and waffles are served on waxy paper....makes no sense.  As you cut your waffle, you are also cutting through the paper. 

I also tried the sweet heat sauce which is basically a spicy maple syrup....goes great with chicken and waffles. Will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"crazy enough I don't eat meat but yes I ate here. The chef made me a sandwich with fries and coleslaw in between the waffles and omg it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Holy Cluck sandwich w/ sweet heat sauce

Title:  Chicken All The Way

Well done!
The presentation and packaging was nice and simple

The Waffles
Very soft and on the thicker side
More sugar was added than usual in the waffle batter
Integrated butter milk and they did not separate the egg yolks from the egg whites which helped maintain the softer texture

The Chicken
Well seasoned with extra use of thyme and cracked peppercorn in the flour mixture
Did not feel oily 
Chicken was butterflied which allowed for double layer within the sandwich
This sandwich did not need any toppings as the flavor from the waffles and the chicken integrated well to give an explosion per bite

Would like to have this sandwich a couple of times per week!"}
{"text":"Great chicken and waffles, cool décor, and very friendly staff. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time after reading reviews on here. I had never tried chicken and waffles before and figured why not see what the hype was about. My girlfriend and I went for lunch on a Friday at around 1pm. It's a relatively small restaurant with little seating during the lunch rush. We waited to for others to finish so we could grab a table. It was a bit over a twenty minute wait for our food. 

I got the Holy Cluck which is a boneless, fried chicken breast served on top of a plain waffle; I got it with a side of fries and coleslaw. The chicken wasn't crispy and was a bit bland but the cluck sauce made up for that. The waffle was bland and spongy, I don't get the hype and the coleslaw was ok.My girlfriend got the Mother Clucker which is three pieces of fried chicken served on a cheddar waffle; she also got a side of fries and coleslaw. She liked the chicken a lot, but she also felt the waffle was bland which was surprising since I figured she was lucky to have gotten the cheddar one. We both really like the cluck sauce! 

I would go again but skip out on the waffle and just go for chicken and fries."}
{"text":"They do 2 things and they do them right. Chicken was tender and flavourful. Waffles were moist and tasty. I'm not usually a person to go to a restaurant twice, but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place when it first opened (I'm a massive lover of fried chicken,) but given that I live in Kensington, it's a bit of a trek for a quick dinner. Last night I made the decision to make it to Cluck Clucks, and it was completely worth the cold, wet walk! 

While other reviewers below will tell you about the great chicken, waffles (um, jalapeno & cheddar? Yum.) and sauces, I wanted to quickly say a word about the fantastic service. The matriarch that was cooking our chicken was absolutely fantastic. She welcomed us when we got to the front, and made sure that we had plenty of sauce to make our dinner delicious. She brought our trays right to our table and told us a bit about the dishes. When we left, she gave us a genuine thank you and made sure that we enjoyed our meals.

Right now, it's unfortunately located behind some scaffolding. I hope that a clear view opens up soon, because the fantastic design of the interior will really invite passers by.   

I highly recommend this joint (and the MC HOT sauce, for spicy lovers;-) )"}
{"text":"I love fried chicken! So the moment I realized there was a new chicken and waffles place opening up - I was excited, yet skeptical. But, honestly, it lived up to my expectations of crispy skin and juicy meat. 

The menu has a ton of super cute puns... which is fun!

I recommend the Mother Clucker - 3 pieces of chicken with a cheddar jalapeno waffle, choice of side and dipping sauce. Twice I've gone, and twice I've gotten the house sauce and the spicy sauce. So so good.

The Cluck Yeah! Is also pretty awesome. Boneless skinless chicken breast, deep fried and sandwiched between cheddar jalapeno waffles, with coleslaw and chipotle aiole.  

And, yeah, I had dessert... The Clucking Lil' Waffies are like a waffle, a churro and a tiny tim donut all became one. Deep fried waffle sticks are dusted in brown sugar and cinnamon and served with nutella and maple syrup. 

Spoke to the owners and they buttermilk brine the chicken overnight and exclusively use broaster fryers so the chicken not only cooks quickly but perfectly every time."}
{"text":"Yum! Chicken was good and the waffle and fries were delicious. The 3-piece combo was more than enough to share between two people, so very reasonable for $16. Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We went on a friend's recommendation and were blown away! We had the Cluck Yeah! and could've eaten two more. 

The staff is fun and inviting and fun! Ask each of them their favorite and they each have a different one.. it's all that good!

We will be going back and passing along all of the recommends we can."}
{"text":"Was in the neighbourhood and checked out Yelp to figure out where to grab a bite. This place was the top rated in the area so I figured I'd check it out even though I still don't get the hype for chicken and waffles. 

I ordered the holy cluck (fried chicken breast and waffle) with their special cluck sauce. 

The chicken was very tender and juicy, so big ups on that. However, the outside wasn't crispy. In terms of grease factor- it wasn't overly greasy, but grease was still there as expected from fried foods. 
The waffle was pretty good too. Fluffy, but soft. Again, not too crunchy, which I wish the outside would have been. 
The sauce was disappointing. It was supposed to be sweet and tangy but frankly it tasted like a thicker Italian dressing. 

The service was great. All questions were answered and I anything wrong was corrected without me even asking about it. 

Overall, I wish this place had more crunch to it. I don't get the hype about chicken and waffles, and this place didn't do much to change that."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ventured here for dinner one night after seeing the positive reviews on Yelp.

We ordered a thigh and chicken breast combo.  The place was busy so we had to wait about 10 minutes for our order to be ready.

WORTH THE WAIT.

The waffle was what I expect a waffle to be.  Properly fluffy and thick.  However, the chicken definitely takes the prize here.  It was properly cooked, beautifully crispy outside with a hot juicy middle.  I ended up cleaning up the chicken and most of my waffle and didn't even touch my fries (and I am a fry junkie).

When we were done our meals and just chatting, the cashier came over to see how our food was and asked if we needed anything else.  We then saw her visit the other tables as well.

Will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Overall Impressions:
Can I get a Cluck Yeah? 4.0 stars for delicious, juicy fried chicken. I will definitely visit again to try other menu items. I've tried chicken and waffles in the US and I find this place to be unique and in many ways better. 

Food:
They kinda divide the Chicken options in terms of whether you want bone-in or boneless. 

I tried the Cluck Yeah sandwich because of all the rave reviews. I was simply impressed and my hands were messy after. I was a bit skeptical of the melding of spicy, sweet and savoury together but it works so damn well. 

The Jalapeño and cheddar waffle surprised me. I thought I was just going to eat the chicken and leave most of the waffle. I was wrong and I ate the whole thang. It comes out hot, soft and delicious. Again, the flavours mesh well together. 

The chicken breast, was lightly battered, golden fried and the oil was not old. The chicken was plentiful and juicy. I love how the top is covered with chipotle aioli and the bottom is dill mayo. It's like two different sandwiches on both sides. Simply genius lol. 

The sandwich had a nice layer of coleslaw. I'll comment on the side of coleslaw while I'm at it. It was rich and creamy as a coleslaw ought to be. Cluck yeah.

The bone-in chicken on waffles was also juicy, crispy and the right amount of batter coating. 

Service:
The staff are super cool. They helped me pick menu items and categorically helped me select based on my preferences. They bring the food right out to you. The tables in the restaurant felt slightly sticky. It was also a hot day when I visited and it was a bit hot inside as well. Otherwise it was spacious and had good vibes."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a Toronto native and was excited to try it! I have had the best chicken and waffles - Roscoes - so I had high expectations. This place did not disappoint! Got a 2-piece and waffle with sweet heat syrup. Hubby had a boneless breast with waffle and regular syrup. Chicken PERFECTLY cooked - nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The waffle was good too. Small place with some seating (we had a group of 9). But I'm big on customer service! While I was waiting for my food I started coughing (tickle in the throat) and what a presumed was the owner came and brought me a cup of water because she heard me coughing. Very kind and attentive. Not necessary but showed that she wanted her customers to be comfortable. Good was great, service was awesome - couldn't ask for anything better!"}
{"text":"We love fried chicken, so having seen all the positive reviews for Cluck Clucks, we made the trek out to The Esplanade to try it out.

Super friendly service, and clearly there are a lot of regulars, as the staff recognized and said hello and chatted with a lot of people.  And when we indicated it was our first visit, the lady at the counter was very patient to explain the various options.

We ended up ordering the Mother Clucker with wedges, and a 3 piece with fries. The waffle in the Mother Clucker was perfectly fluffy.  The chicken was juicy, and the skin crispy, yet not greasy!  The potato wedges and fries were also very good.  We can definitely understand the high ratings!  We also really enjoyed the chipotle aioli - went well with the fries and wedges.  (We didn't use it on the chicken, because the chicken on its own was already very tasty.)

This place is a little far for us but it will be on our list of places to visit when we find ourselves in the east side of downtown."}
{"text":"Oh no I'm in trouble!  An amazing fried chicken and waffles place in walking distance.  Holy cluck is Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait for them to open and give their menu a try and let me say, it was worth the wait. This was my first time having their food and so far have tried one item on their menu, the Cluck Yeah.....totally delicious!!!! Definitely would have Cluck Yeah again, but looking forward to trying other items on their menu. The portions are huge, ate half and saved the other half for dinner.

Had the opprotunity to talk to the owner, great friendly guy. He has the right idea and location for the restaurant. Best of luck and I hope we see more locations around the city."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and tasty chicken and waffles. I ordered the waffles with the Jalapeno, and enjoyed the extra kick of heat.  

The portion looked small when my order came, but I had to doggy bag half of my meal because I was full."}
{"text":"Came here after following a foodie group ( @we.ate.here).. So glad.... Best chicken n waffles. The waffles are fluffy and the chicken perfectly cooked... ... The right amount of sauce n the best waffles.... Good customer service...."}
{"text":"This hot new place was a hit for me today.  I was craving waffles and this was just the spot.  I didn't order chicken and waffles which I know, I know, you don't do when you visit a chicken and waffles joint.  I just wasn't feeling for chicken and luckily they have a stand alone waffle for $4.99.  It's the Belgian waffle size and it came with Nutella and syrup on the side.  Hand me a cup of coffee and I would have been in heaven.  I do have to say the chicken and waffle combos looks amazing!  I did have a bite of my friends giant chicken wings which were delish.  The staff were very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that eating here was my first experience of eating chicken and waffles.  Something I have heard about a lot but never quite understood.  

This did not disappoint.  My first time (I have now eaten here many, many many times) I could have sworn I heard angel singing in the background.  It was a happy, wonderfully gluttonous food experience. 

The fried chicken is fresh, crispy juicy tender and .....just plain good.  The waffles and fluffy, warm and the perfect vessel for the chicken and sauce.  
Because it is cooked to order there is a bit of a wait but it is well worth it.

The only thing that can be improved is the french fries.  Skip those, they are just filler and save room for the chicken."}
{"text":"Already wrote a review a while back about their amazing food. This ones for customer service by the owner! This is how you do it! CLUCK YEAH!!"}
{"text":"Overall chicken was juicy and waffle was good however would have liked bigger portion for the price."}
{"text":"Loved it! It was the only place for chicken my daughter n I could find at 9 pm on May 24 weekend...I think it was Sunday night if I remember correctly, anyways, this place is definitely doing chicken right!!"}
{"text":"had a mother clucker! it was amazing! the waffle was cooked perfect, nice and moist. friend chicken was unbelievable, definitely best chicken n waffles in toronto! will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Crispy, juicy made-to-order fried chicken and giant, delicious waffles? What's not to love! Also, their fries are kind of amazing. :)"}
{"text":"We went just before catching our flight back home. I've read some great things about this place so we definitely wanted to try it out before leaving town. It's in the trendy part of town, lots of culture and the city life vibe. The lady at the front counter was very polite and accommodating. Simply put, this was the best fried chicken I've eaten. Pair it with a light waffle and add spicy syrup makes this combo sweet and savory heaven. Please try it and you will be impressed!"}
{"text":"Went on a redux with the wife and ate the What The Cluck. 

Chicken frying prowess probably makes it one of the best in Toronto - light, crispy, skin that isn't greasy.  Juicy meat. 

Owner is super friendly, remembers faces, and genuinely seems to be doing this for the love of it. 

If I had any criticisms, it is that while perfectly fried, was lighter on the seasoning than I would've liked. Also, the spicy maple sauce could've been spicier.  But not going to hold that against them - that's just my personal preference."}
{"text":"I ordered from Cluck Clucks via Foodora. My experience was largely negative: my order was extremely late, and there were items missing. Both of these fall on the restaurant, as I was able to track the stages of delivery: the order in the preparation stage for an undue amount of time. Add to that the fact that I paid for items I did not receive and I'm one unhappy camper. 

After phoning them, the best suggestion they could come up with was for me to order a second meal and that they'd make sure to pack both coleslaws with that delivery. Ridiculous!

I won't be eating from this place again."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this new place right near work.  Went there yesterday with a coworker for lunch.  The staff is amazing.  Food is very tasty.  Space is bright, clean, and airy.

Just two critiques.  One minor and one more concerning.

First they are using cheap plastic cutlery.  Staff explained however that city bylaw prohibits them from using metal cutlery.  They are looking into a better solution however,

More worrying are the prices.  I got their Mother Clucker item.  A generous serving of fries and a big piece of chicken on a waffle sandwich.  Also a can of pop.  After tax this was $16.72, for a lunch.  Seems pretty high for a lunch joint. In fact, I spotted a few kids from the nearby school pop in and leave right away after seeing the prices.  

They are great but they may be too expensive for the area. I wish them all the best and will continue to visit them whenever my wallet allows for this extravagance."}
{"text":"The chicken was pretty good and their menu is kinda adorable. I believe they only serve halal chicken and the chicken were quite tasty/crispy. Really enjoyed how interactive management were while wiping down the tables."}
{"text":"The food was very, very good and the staff was amazing.  I got the mother clucker with the sweet heat (maple syrup with a kick!).  The jalapeño and cheddar waffle fries it's crispy fried chicken was cooked to perfection.  Will for sure go again!"}
{"text":"So freaking delicious!!! I've had Cluck Clucks twice, and keep going back for their 'CLUCK YEAH' ($13.09) because it's just that good!! Seriously, everyone should try this meal!! The portion sizes are pretty substantial and perfect for sharing.

In one instance, we ordered a massive take-out from the office, and they had everything ready in 25 minutes as promised. They didn't miss any items, and my coworkers were extremely pleased with what they received! 

The restaurant itself is really spacious with super cute wall decals, and is always bustling with people. I seriously can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre. It cost $15 just for the twaco. The chicken was dry, thin, not crunchy. The waffle wasn't crunchy either. Also located in a sketchy area"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way to the Christmas Market.  I ordered the chicken thigh and waffle with maple syrup.  The guy working the cash was incredibly nice and put up with my husband's indecisiveness.  Chicken was moist and freshly breaded and fried.  Waffle was tasty and fresh.  Overall great dinner.  Please open one in the west end."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Fantastic addition to the neighbourhood! The chicken wings are massive and really yummyyy!"}
{"text":"Chicken here is amazing good. Got a combo of leg and thigh. The spice on the chicken is amazing good and there is sauce that it comes with, think its cluck sauce, that is so yummy. 
My new favourite chicken place for sure."}
{"text":"Perfect comfort food. Amazing fried chicken and waffle are good; not too sweet. Love the dill mayo :)"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and waffles! Was a bit apprehensive trying this after having the chicken and waffles at Dirty Bird (which I've only had once and the waffles were soggy and not great at all) but this this place was AMAZING!! Love their Cluck Yeah!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out bc my husband found it on yelp. I'd say 3.5-4 stars. The menu is straight forward...well priced for a combo...2 piece chicken, waffle, drink and side was 13 bbucks. As mentioned by others, chicken is fresh fried, juicy and well seasoned. Skin is crispy and delicious. 10 to 15 minutes wait time. 
The waffle left much to be desired...so the chicken is definitely the star!
Decor wise, its bright and inviting but washrooms weren't too clean, missing paper towels as well.

I'd return for a fried chicken craving if I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Wow my second time here and, I live around the area.  I got to tell ya there is some goooood shit coming out of here. Chicken is tasty and juicy, the potato wedges are probably the best I have ever had, nicely seasoned . Everything is cook to order, nothing frozen. One of the owners who I had the pleasure of meeting is a real nice dude and the rest of the staff are just real cool cats and lets not forget the real nice lady that works there,  I Inquired about the sauces and she was a real sweet hart and brought me a little taste of each to try, which I really appreciated.  Real Inviting . I got the 10 piece and large potato wedges for the second time and I did not disappoint just simply delicious. If you like fried chicken \"you got to eat here\" (stole that line). If your around the area have a taste for yourself, f I'm pretty sure you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Another favorite when it comes to some delicious fried chicken in Toronto! Between Dirty Bird and Cluck Clucks, hands down the BEST chicken in the GTA!Keep up the amazing work you guys!!"}
{"text":"So I went back a couple weeks later to give it another go.  They were in the middle of a photo shoot.  Raza the owner recognized me (well, at least his brother did)!  Wow, great with faces!  (Full disclosure: To make up for my unsatisfactory experience, they comp-ed my partner and I's meal.)  It seems they already have regulars.

I cannot say enough good things for the customer service here.  Raza took the time to talk to us and tell us about his restaurant experience, and about his family.  He went above and beyond, and I really like their story.  They are a mom and pop shop worth supporting.  5+ stars for customer service this time.

My hubby loved this place.  I see him wanting to come here more than me.

As for the food, we got something different this time:
2pc chicken and waffles (with sweet heat sauce and wedges) 
- the hot maple syrup was less watered down this time, instead of the sriracha style heat they put in it, I wish they used some scotch bonnet 2*
- the chicken was crisp and incredibly moist (you'll see my pic), but underseasoned for my taste 4*
- the waffle was still great (crispy, chewy) 5*
- the side of wedges could be bigger, also I wish they had more seasoning ala Mary Browns 3*

Cluck Yeah! 
- jalapeno cheddar waffle sounds good, but in practice I didnt taste the cheddar or the jalapeno, but the texture was still spot on 4*
- the sandwiches are easier to eat than the bone-in chicken, but the breast was just lacking additional seasoning and flavour, and does not fry up crisp  3*

In the future, I'll stick with bone-in chicken or maybe try their wings.

Also, as another Yelper noted, the prices are a bit high for the kids in the neighbourhood to grab some fried chicken.  But, I confirmed with Raza, that they have specials for local students that they don't advertise, and all the local kids know about. 

Overall, I give a 3.5*"}
{"text":"This place was around a couple of corners but well worth the time it took to find it. My meal was made to order and both the waffle (jalapeño & cheddar) and fried chicken (3 pieces) came piping hot. The chicken was crispy and tasty and the waffle was light and flavourful. I think I would have enjoyed the waffle more if it was softer but other than that, it was a marriage made in heaven with the chicken. The sauces were amazing; the meal came with a chipotle sauce and a maple syrup (sorry; I don't have the menu in front of me at moment but the sauces were standard for the meal ordered). One of the best chicken & waffles in Toronto. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Would definitely go again, I wish they could open one in the Scarborough area! 

The food is delicious, the holy cluck combo was definitely worth the commute of going there and it was extremely filling and very tasty."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying fried chicken and waffles. To get straight to the point, I'm not a fan of this concept. To me, fried chicken is best on its own as a savoury meal instead of mixing sweetness into it. That being said, Cluck Clucks uses fantastic quality chicken and I will definitely go back just for the chicken next time. Portions are also great - I could only eat half and had to pack the rest to take home. I would highly recommend Mother Clucker with the chipotle aioli!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing fried chicken I've ever had! Cluck clucks is on Ritual so it makes ordering take out so easy. The skin is so crispy (with zero grease) and the meat is so juicy. The flavour doesn't just end with the skin, you can taste it right down to the bones! The potato wedges are equally delicious, the right about of crispiness on the outside and softness on the inside. And who doesn't like waffles? Chicken and waffle! What a great combo and with the bits of jalapeños, it really gives my taste buds a good kick."}
{"text":"Service is great but the food comes out very slowly. Around 20-30 minutes (came here twice). The waffle comes out faster than the chicken so you get a crispy juicy chicken on top of a soggifying waffle. Sad. 
I wish that maple syrup came as the default sauce and that you could choose 1 addtional sauce without the extra fifty cents. Hard to enjoy a sweet waffle with chipotle aioli, if you know what I mean. 

Fries were decent. Thickish cut, crispy. 

It's worth coming here for a visit esp if you are down here for St. Lawrence Market or the Distillery District. Not a lot of tables so may be difficult to find a seat if you come in a gorup."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place. Pretty busy when I went on a Saturday night with not much seating so just be aware of that. I got the cluck yeah sandwich and I was definitely a fan! I loved the chipotle sauce and dill sauce in it. I also got the potato wedges on the side and thought they could be a bit more seasoned but still good none the less. Would definitely come back to get the same sandwich...not sure if I would really want to try anything else on the menu though."}
{"text":"Solid fried chicken.  Available to pickup via Ritual and probably is delivered via Foodora or something else.   Have had the chicken 4X - every time was great.  First time was dine-in, other 3 were take-out/pick-up. Moist, juicy chicken, almost perfectly cooked, and the skin has been nice and crispy every time (taste like a guitly pleasure but not as heavy as fast food fried chicken)  

4.5/5.  Only reco would be to include a complimentary sauce with the chicken only piece deals - doesn't make sense why you wouldn't want the sauce if you didn't get it as a waffle.  

A trio for 99c (smaller portions) would be appreciated too."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles I have ever had! The chicken is so hot and juicy and the waffles are so so so soooo soft and tender! I lobe the names of the items on their menu like \"what cluck\" and \"mother clucker\" funny and catchy! Also the customer service from the owners is superb. Oh and did I mention the fries??? Some of the best homemade fries you can get in the city!! Absolutely adoree!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Cluck Yeah! | Boneless Chicken Breast In Between Jalapeno And Cheddar Waffle With Coleslaw, Chipotle Aioli, Dill Mayo

The Chicken was tender and crispy. I really liked the waffle since it's very unique - first time seeing Jalapeno and Cheddar. So there's a really nice kick to it.

The potato wedges could've been more. I think there's only 5 pcs I got. If I knew it was that little, I would've gotten fries instead. 

A must for Chicken and Waffles."}
{"text":"I walk by this street every once in a while and despite having this place bookmarked forever never noticed it (The address says esplanade even though its on a side street)
Never mind I finally made it here. Even though I do like fried chicken I only eat it every once a while so didn't have high expectations here. 
My exposure to southern cuisine is also somewhat limited and had no idea what a combo of chicken and waffle would be like. Pleased to share that it works somehow. I ordered the Mother Clucker with clucker sauce on the side. DC ordered the open sandwich with dill sauce and side of potato wedges. The place is more like a fast food joint with a greasy feel on the table and chairs but I wasn't expecting fine dinning here in the first place.
Our chicken was fried to order and came out piping hot. The waffle I had was cheese based and didn't have any sweet finish as expected. The chicken itself is decent and quite moist. I like dark meat so enjoyed it. The sauce itself is OK I think I will upgrade to the hot sauce version on the next visit. The potato wedges are huge and I didn't enjoy them much. Will try the fries next visit.
My DC had tried this place before so knew what to expect. 
I think I will be back to get my fix when I crave fried chicken and might even try the sweet version of the waffles.
Good option once one factors in the price."}
{"text":"One of the best chicken in Toronto! Family run with friendly service. Fries and wedges can be hit or miss depending on the day but the chicken is always great. Highly recommend the Cluck Sauce. Don't typically get it with the waffles but they were good the one time I tried. Tables are a little uneven and sometimes sticky when eating in, but isn't a big problem."}
{"text":"Freshly fried chicken! It was pretty good but nothing special. I think I like Popeyes better."}
{"text":"At the cashier's recommendation, I had the \"Cluck Yeah\" which consists of boneless chicken breast, jalapeno cheddar waffle, coleslaw, chipotl aioli and dill mayo. It was SO cluckin' good! (You'll get my cheesy joke after you read their menu)

It was good portion of tasty fried chicken, the waffle was plush, slightly sweet, slightly spicy and TOTALLY delicious, the slaw was crisp, creamy perfection and the chipotle aioli added even more creaminess and a bit of spice. If you want some real spiciness, they have tobasco sauces available for self-serve.

It's served kind of like a halved sandwich (complete with toothpicks to keep the whole thing from falling apart), but I have no idea who could eat it that way. I ate mine with a knife-and-fork like a normal person.

Again, this was SO good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tasty for sure, and so fresh! Fast, friendly service. Note: the jalapeño waffles have some kick even though I was told it was mild."}
{"text":"They don't have a freezer. Do you know what that means. Everything is as FRESH as it can get. Chicken hand cut fries waffles. Everything!!

The chicken was perfectly cooked tender and juicy inside and crispy outside. There was no feeling of guilt or nasty grease feel after. Waffles were delicious loved the jalapeno cheddar. I took half of my friends what the cluck sandwich and it was amazing with creamy coleslaw not that watery shit you get at fast food places. 

Decor was cute and place clean. I look forward to them opening another location on the west side of town too!"}
{"text":"I have a fried chicken addiction and this place feeds into it. 

The place was totally empty when I went so I was a bit apprehensive. I couldn't have been more wrong. The fried chicken was lightly breaded, flavourful and juicy. The fries were perfectly seasoned. 

They do fry your chicken from scratch so it does take longer but it's worth the wait. Recommend"}
{"text":"While wandering about this great city, my friends and I were hungry. What did we want? Chicken and waffles, of course! We headed to the Esplanade and checked it out. 

It has lots of seating and a very entertaining menu. The menu plays off the common phrases, replacing the F-bomb with Cluck. Somehow I can't picture my Grandmother ordering the Mother Clucker, but that's just me. I went with Holy Cluck with Cluck Sauce and potato wedges(Combo $13.49). It was a boneless chicken breast served on a waffle with the sauce on the side. They aren't licensed, but they have a large fridge of pop, juice and water.

Our group was 12 people, but the food didn't take too long. It was all hot and fresh. The chicken was juicy coated in a crispy batter, I didn't even need the waffle. The piece of chicken was big. The waffle was so fresh with just a hint of sweet which made these a match made in heaven causing me to go into an instant food coma. The Cluck Sauce is tart and tangy. I think this meal has hit every part of my tongue; no regrets! 

The service here was great. They're over all of the menu puns, but are not above laughing at your terrible jokes. There was a lady there, might have been the owner, that was very gracious and continuously apologizing for the wait. The food was brought out in batches which was no big deal. We were all talking and having a great time. The side dishes were big enough that if we REALLY couldn't wait, we could steal a few fries off someone else's tray. Heehee. 

I'd love to go back here. Writing about it is making me crave it!"}
{"text":"We went around dinner time (7ish) and it took really long to get our food. So long we almost left (I think it was 20-30mins, and that's long for a fast food restaurant). Just when we were losing hope, we got our food. The sandwich looked amazing (I wish I got it with my boyfriend) but mine looked good too (3pc chicken with a waffle - recommendation: get it with maple syrup!!). 

Chicken was hot as hell lol and we were so hungry that we tried to eat it hot so flavour wasn't all there but the skin was nice and crispy. Waffle was soft but definitely needed some maple syrup. Wedges were OK, may have wanted the coleslaw. 

Would I go back? Maybe."}
{"text":"Girlfriend left me alone for a weekend.

Had a large pizza for lunch. Crushed a 12 Pack of Vitamin-P. This for dinner. 

My arteries were as clogged as my stomach was full."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? My little sister wanted to have lunch here for her birthday and I must say with age comes wiseness! This was an amazing choice. We both got the \"cluck yeah!\". After our first bite we both looked at each other in amazement. It was superb!!! The right amount of food, jalapeños gave it a little kick and the chicken was seasoned perfectly. The price was just right for the food. It was about 2pm when we got there so it wasn't busy at all. I will definitely be returning but I will have to take my sister or she'll never forgive me."}
{"text":"It's a cluckin' good time. (I know it's terrible but I just had to). If you're looking for some delicious fried chicken and waffles this is the place to go! I ordered the pound of wings, which come plain with your choice of sauce on the side - I opted for a spicy chipotle. The wings are huge and very crisp! My only complaint was they were a bit on the salty side. I would give the food a 3, but the service here was unexpectedly nice so I'm rounding up to 4 stars. The place has more of fast food feel to it so naturally I'm expecting McDonalds type service, but someone, who I believe was the owner, actually came around to see how we were doing during our meal and told us to grab more sauce if we needed it. Our group really appreciated that. The food was also prepared and served promptly considering we were a fairly large group. 

It's a good spot if you've got a craving for chicken and waffles, and they're great for groups so bring your friends with you!"}
{"text":"Can't get much better for comfort food. Great stuff, super tasty. Loved the place. Definitely check it out if you're feeling like stuffing your stomach."}
{"text":"The line up was a bit nuts, but it was just reviewed so it was totally understandable. We took it home because the place was packed. Was a 8 min walk and my chicken was still piping hot. The food was not soggy in the container which was a worry for me. I was hoping to get photos the way it's presented on the tray but the takeout container will have to do. Hubby got the Holy Cluk with the Cluk sauce. I got sweet heat. Both very good. The chicken was fried to perfection and it had a very good and not over powering herb/spice blend. Very happy with our combos even if we couldn't get a seat inside. Also, combo was way too much so next time I'll for-go the combo. Great find right in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"One of the best chicken and waffle sandwiches I've ever had! Ordered the Cluck Yeah! and it was amazing. Food is cooked after you order it so it comes out piping hot and super fresh. Would definitely come back (in fact, plan to do so before we leave Toronto)!"}
{"text":"Love it! The waffles were soft and moist and loved the spicy kick. A chill place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Really good fraaaaaid chicken. Not too greasy, the right amount of crispy and super moist and tender on the inside."}
{"text":"The chicken was absolutely D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! It was sizzling hot and juicy right down to the bone. The meat had a melt-in-your-mouth tenderness and every bite was complemented by the flavorful crunch of the lightly deep fried skin.

I added cheddar to my waffle and I didn't feel like it was anything special but overall the waffle was still good. I chose the dill mayo as my sauce and that was just mediocre as well. The chicken was undoubtedly the main show. Although this restaurant is pretty far for me, I would definitely come back next time and just order 1-2 lbs of the chicken wings!"}
{"text":"I can't believe anyone could ever have anything negative to say about this place. The food is amazing. Yea there is a little bit of wait if you go mid day but it's worth the wait. You get a lot of food for what you pay for. The pricing is reasonable. This became our fav morning spot during our visit in September. During our four day stay we are there three mornings. Cannot wait to go back just so I can get my fix. :)."}
{"text":"This place is on point. First time here and the cashier had no issues telling me what were good options. I ordered a waffle and chicken with the bone in that came with a drink and fries. Chicken was fried just right. Not greasy or anything. You have several different sauces you can get but I just went with maple. If you haven't been you are missing out."}
{"text":"Great local business and a great addition to the community!  I have been walking by their storefront for some time now awaiting their opening!  The staff are super nice, and the food is great!  I had the What the Cluck! with the Cluck Sauce.  There was a little wait for the chicken, which I appreciated because that meant that they were cooking it once ordered, and it wasn't sitting somewhere in a heat pan or something.  I'd rather wait and have freshly cooked food than something stale and old.  The Cluck Sauce was unique and tasted very nice, it had a bit of a kick, but not so much that it was bothersome.  Will definitely go back! Happy that you guys are open! (Sorry, I forgot to take a picture, I was so hungry that I ate it as soon as I got it)"}
{"text":"This place is great and you should go! More details below. 

RESTAURANT
We went around lunch time on a Friday and it was quite packed.
The restaurant itself is quite small but it was very bright and clean. 
There's maybe 20 seats in total, so keep this in mind if you're thinking of dining in. 

SERVICE 
The cashier was very pleasant. She saw us struggling to decide our order and was very quick to give suggestions. 
I went with the solo little clucker (single piece of chicken and a waffle) with the spicy honey,  as recommended.
Our orders took about 15 minutes to come out as it is made to order. 

FOOD
The chicken was very flavourful and fried to perfection. It was a tad bit salty but I will overlook that as it tasted so wonderful with the spicy honey sauce. 
I saw some comments about the chicken being dry, this was not my experience at all. I thought the chicken was very moist! 
If you love your sauces spicy, you may want to try a different sauce as this was certainly more on the mild side. 
The waffles are also made fresh and was perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.
I thought the ratio of chicken and waffle was perfect. But if you're a meat lover, I'd certainly get a second piece.

VALUE
It was about $9 for my meal. In my opinion, the amount of food that you get and the quality were fantastic. Definitely worth it in my book and I think its actually a bit cheaper than some other chicken waffle places in Toronto. Bottom line: It's worth it."}
{"text":"Somehow, the fried chicken in the waffle burger has shrunk .. nevertheless good experience, satisfies the taste buds with the variety of sauces .. the staff is welcoming and does tend to remember you :)"}
{"text":"Mmm this place is gooood. I had the three piece bone in chicken with jalapeno cheddar waffle. Loved the spice in the waffle. I got the dill sauce and that went really well! I would return."}
{"text":"Chicken was crispy and juicy. The workers were really sweet as well smiling and saying hello. Definitely recommend checking it out"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing people talk about halal chicken and waffles in toronto. At first it seemed like a strange combination but I had to try it ! 

I'm sooo glad I decided to come here I loved everything about this place , from the decor to the funny names the menu items had. I ordered a chicken waffle sandwich ( I think it's called the \"holy cluck\") and it was amazing. The chicken was fried perfectly and the waffle was nice and fluffy. On top of that they also had this great sauce. 5/5 starts I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Good fried chicken. The waffle \"taco\" was a miss...too soggy from all the sauces. The sweet waffle dish was very good, cinnamon and brown sugar with icing sugar on top. The cluck sauce was too smoky, the dill one noy tangy, just like a mayo.  4.5 stars?????? No."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and waffles. We had the cluk yeah! and holy moly, it was amazing. It was my first time trying the dish and I was not disappointed. There is a perfect mixture of sauces (sweet and spicy) lathered across a crunchy chicken breast piece sandwiched between a warm jalapeño cheddar waffle. We live in the GTA but I definitely don't mind doing the drive down to Toronto for some of the cluk yeah. It was that good. Prices are a little high but you can get away with a solo sandwich and still feel full to the brim."}
{"text":"If you're looking to satisfy your chicken and waffle cravings, this place is for you.

Personal favourite - the \"Cluck yeah\"- Picture a mouth-watering crispy fried chicken in between 2 cheddar jalapeño waffles, with chipotle sauce and coleslaw. At a price point of ~$16 for a combo, it is definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"This place was a bit hard to find but I'm sure glad I did!! 

I went on Nov 26th and they had their anniversary special. It was 3.99 for one piece chicken and a mini waffle. We also got the Mother Clucker combo for 14.99. It was 3 piece bone in chicken on a jalapeno and cheese waffle. Served with seasoned fries. 

The chicken is soooo juicy, the fries are fresh and salted to perfection, the waffle is light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness and the sauce paired really well with everything. This was honestly the juiciest chicken I ever had in my life. 

The waittime is a bit long but they make everything to order and bring the food to your table. I'll definitely be coming back to try other things!!"}
{"text":"Ordered boneless chicken and waffles 
Had chipotle sauce and it was amazing. 
Also ordered wings- which were HUGE and amazing and juicy with the cluck cluck sauce. 
Will definitely be ordering again. Looking forward to trying other sauces. 
We had it delivered and it was on time and no issues. 
We had fries as the side as well and potato wedges. I would choose the fries again. 
Great chicken!"}
{"text":"Good chicken and waffles! They jalapeños in the waffles gives a good kick when you get the bite.  I found the waffles a little dry.  The chicken is delicious,  and the choice of sauces is great.  Really caters yo different tastes within a group. I would get fries over the wedges,  the amount of wedges you get vs.  Fries is kind of ridiculous.  Thankfully the owner noticed and gave me extra! The owner is a great guy and a total foodie! If you want recommendations for food,  strike up a convo!"}
{"text":"Great food! 

Delicious fried chicken 

The waffles were tasty as well

They just need to add more items to the menu 

Need to accept USD
Need to get a warm light to keep the food warmer 

Good overall"}
{"text":"Okay, so this is going to sound weird, but I don't eat too much meat these days and don't really like sugar, so naturally...I'd go to a chicken and waffles place right?  Weekends are usually my free for all days whereas weekdays are my strict health days, I decided to come here with approximately 8 to 9 people last minute.

I ordered the Holy Cluck with coleslaw on the side and the Cluck sauce on the side. The chicken was warm and meaty, the coleslaw tasted great and for a fast food joint, the service was great.  They were able to serve a table of 8-10 people in a matter of 15 minutes even though it was just two people working plus someone who I assume to be the owner (and was amazingly friendly)..

Verdict: While I personally am not the biggest fan of fried food or sugar, I think for anyone who loves fried chicken, this is a great place to visit."}
{"text":"Dirty Bird doesn't compare to Cluck Clucks. The fries are also godly."}
{"text":"A very simple fast food outlet. Barebone decor and simple menu, which are basically variation of number of chicken pieces, boned vs no bones, with waffles + your choice of sauce.

They made everything after you order so it does take about 10 minutes wait.  

The chicken is indeed incredibly crispy and juicy. The waffle is also very yummy, savoury and sweet at the same time.  I had the coleslaw which was actually quite fresh.  The potato wedges were not so remarkable.

While i really like it, the concept of eating chicken and waffle tgt baffles me lol. Having to use knife and fork to cut up the waffle means that the paper on the serving tray gets disintergrated. And then have to switch to eat the chicken with hand (yes i am barbaric ) just didn't feel like a cohesive experience to me.  Plus, i think the waffle really fills you up.

I will definitelt return, but i think in future i will either ordee just chicken or just waffle."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest, I was not expecting to like this place as much as I did. The chicken was to die for and it really hit the spot. I'm a sucker for fried chicken and waffles and this was definitely up there as one of the best! 

What really sold me on this meal was how crispy the chicken was (sometimes the outside is wet/soggy) because it really contrasted from how light and fluffy the waffle was. I know this is a fast food type of place, but the chicken was actually quite good and the prices were really cheap for the amount of food you get.

The one thing I'd say about this place is we had to wait a decent amount of time (there might've been a holdup in the kitchen or something) before getting our food, but it wasn't terrible - just longer than expected for a fast food place."}
{"text":"I have found a new favourite comfort food spot in Toronto! This place is really cute when you walk in and the way their menu is displayed on the wall is super cool, I got the \"Cluck Yeah\" and it was everything I could ever ask for, but I'd probably get the order with bone in chicken as the boneless chicken didn't compare to their OG chicken. I'd also recommend the dill mayo if you want dip for your fries it was delicious."}
{"text":"Went in on a Monday evening because I was craving some chicken and waffles.   The place was not hard to find, next to this laundromat, and a pizza nova. Ordered the chicken breast with waffle combo.  Waited about 15 mins and got my hot fried chicken on a waffle with a sauce on the side.  The waffle itself is nothing crazy. Just plain waffle.  It tasted like what I would make with a waffle mix, it's not like the waffles I've had at Roscoe's or Bruxie in the states.  But the chicken was crisp on the outside tender on the inside and well seasoned/flavored.  All in all a good spot to hit your cravings but not \"OMG wow chicken and waffles!\"   I was happy that it wasn't sweet though.  I hate sweet meat."}
{"text":"The thing to have here is the Cluck Yeah sandwich waffles are substituted for the bread. Chicken is moist , all the sauces add flavour and the waffles are good but beware sometimes the jalapeño in them can have a zing and sometimes they don't. I always found jalapeños to be an untrustworthy heat source ;).  Chicken on bone on its own was just ok, the sandwiches are the thing."}
{"text":"So I got the boneless chicken breast on a plain waffle I'm not sure what the name was I think it was the second one on the list and the chicken was beyond delicious but the waffle seemed a little bit dry. I was very satisfied with the chicken but I wish they gave more dipping sauces. I was really disappointed to see that maple syrup counted as one of the dipping sauces especially in a place like Canada where they are well-known for their maple syrup!! The chipotle aioli was the best dipping sauce for the chicken which my friend got and we shared I got the maple syrup. I paid extra to get a small side of Nutella which was really good with the waffle and with the fries. All in all, the waffle was quite dry and eating it alone made your mouth extremely dry. I would definitely be back to give it another shot but I do hope they improve the texture of the waffle and make it a little bit more moist and enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Amazing ! This is our new favourite spot. Best to come here at off peak times so u can get a seat. The food is made fresh to order and is served by the sweetest owners. They really care that you enjoy the food. I cannot wait to go back. The jalapeño and cheese waffle is the best. Chicken is tender and crispy ... lots of sauce options too."}
{"text":"Got the what the cluck (2pcs bone in; drumstick and breast) with cheesy fries. Tender and flavourful meat with skin as crusty as Chinese crispy pork belly, if that's your thing. The waffle was okay; crunchy and not too sweet. The fries were mediocre.

Nice branding, though the menu on the wall was hard to read. Good choice selection on the type of chicken parts and sauces.

Maybe I cut too hard, but I found the paper served on the tray useless because I cut right through it and it \"disappears\" into the meat. Was also disappointed that the \"maple syrup\" isn't real maple syrup, it's like Aunt Jemima's pancake syrup.

My biggest comment is the grease. It's not only in the meat, but it will stay in your clothes until you wash them. Ups and downs of fried chicken, right?"}
{"text":"The only thing you need to know ahead of time is the aren't really on Esplanade, they are facing Princess.

Saw this spot mentioned in a search we made before coming to Toronto and the reviews were so good it made our \"to do\" list, we walked over just after St Lawrence Market visit.

This is a tiny place turning out great chicken!! I've never really gotten the allure of sticking a piece of chicken atop a waffle and pouring syrup over it all...didn't really do anything for me. Not until today! I saw a sandwich go by but thought it would be too much food, so I ordered a Twacko - again so much food but so good I stuffed it all in!

Crispy fried chicken breast, amazingly tasty, topped with skinny fried tortilla straws, nicely spiced creamy chipotle sauce and Cole slaw - all on a slightly sweet waffle. You gotta eat this baby with fork and knife - it comes in a metal taco holing wedge you can eat off of. What a great blend of flavors and textures!

My husband had a piece of chicken on the bone on a waffle - he eats very sparingly, loved the chicken, left the waffle. I would have eaten it right out from under that chicken, if only I had room after my twaco!  

Seating is limited, but everyone feels free to share open seats at their table, it's also near a park, so I guess you could take your food out to a bench and do it al fresco style.

I wish we had this in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"O M G!!! Just wow....incredible Awesometasticness...
 I really can't describe how happy I am right now eating this. Fluffy big waffles and huge chicken portions. I got the cluck yeah and Daughter got the holy cluck. She is beaming and I am a bit sad....I never want this to end...EVER!!!! 
 It is not very busy and I'm here on a sunny Saturday afternoon and they bring the food to your table. They have a few seats so you should be OK to walk in and sit.
  Most definitely come here again, but I will try bone-in cause it looks wow."}
{"text":"Best chicken & waffles ever! You know when you go somewhere and either the waffles are good and the chicken is not, or the chicken is on point and the waffles are soggy...well you get none of that here. EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.

The chicken was crispy and juicy while the waffles weren't too sweet and had the perfect fluffy texture. Oh and the Cluck Sauce is heaven. It's like sweet chili and mayo had a baby. Paired perfectly with the chicken and the crispy fries.

Basically, everything was amazing and I would come back again and again! My only wish is that they had a spicy chicken option then all my dreams would come true."}
{"text":"Venue was nice, food tasted great, I love the concept of a halal chicken and waffles place BUT the chicken was very undercooked on the inside and when I showed the worker they made me another one but that one was also very undercooked. So I finished my waffle and left. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with chicken and waffles and Clucks clucks is no different. I'm just reviewing this place based off one item on their menu. 

We went on a weekday for a quick dinner bite and the place was packed, as all the seating was occupied. 

One of the good things about this place is that their chicken is made (fried) to order so that means everything is fresh, however that also means that it takes a bit of time for you to get your food. 

I went with the cluck yeah waffle sandwich and was pretty satisfied with it. It's a fun little mess to eat. The jalapeño cheddar waffle was really unique and really adds depth as you could really taste the cheddar and jalapeños in there. The chicken (breast) was very juicy but probably could have been more crispy. There was quite a bit of chipotle aioli and dill mayo so it was difficult to taste the chicken itself aside from being the protein in the sandwich. That being said, the aoili was excellent.  Another thing to add about the chicken was that there were two separate smaller breast pieces (butterflied?) in each of the sandwiches, and I think one bigger piece would have worked better in terms of being easier to eat.

Value could have been a bit better with one sandwich being nearly $15. However with The Dirty Bird being very similar in pricing, it isn't so bad. I would personally place Dirty Bird higher than cluck clucks but cluck clucks is still a very good option for fried chicken in the city."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after hearing rave reviews from people who work in that area. When I first entered the restaurant I was overwhelmed with the delicious smell of fresh waffles. I soon noticed the comfy and cozy environment and was excited to read the menu. The menu items are located on the left when you first walk in and are very easy to read and understand. I ordered chicken breast with waffle and syrup to go on top. The chicken was deep-fried and so Juicy and Delicious. The waffle was so fresh and so delicious it almost was better than the chicken. I highly suggest the syrup as it is fresh maple syrup that is real. The two combined with syrup it just an unreal pairing for lunch. I highly recommend that anyone who likes a good breakfast / sweet lunch tries this establishment as it is unbelievable. I will be returning and wish I could go every day if I worked in the area."}
{"text":"A great addition to the neighbourhood! When you walk by it smells heavily (almost overwhelming) of oil and deep-friedness outside, which one can take as a good or a bad thing. The smell continues when you walk in which amplifies from their open kitchen, which is nice to see them freshly prepping your food but is also not the most attractive kitchen and you see the oil smoke when the middle aged lady drops the chicken in. I got there at about 8.30pm on a Friday night for dinner and it was about half full. 

I got the Little Clucker with the sweet heat sauce. The chicken was super good, it was moist and crispy. The waffle was also not bad, thick and crisp enough to hold the chicken without getting excessively soggy. The sweet heat sauce was a bit bland and watered down. It also wasn't enough and I had to ask for a second one. It was all in all good, but I don't know why it felt like it was just missing something...

The man working at the counter was very nice and friendly, chatted with us for a bit and even checked up on us. The other staff seemed impartial about everything. I would come back for the non-pretentious neighborhood joint food just for the location (its within walking distance of work) and every time someone in my office gets it for lunch it smells so good."}
{"text":"This review is overdue a couple months.

I ordered the jalapeño chicken waffle sandwich. DELICIOUS! Savoury waffle and perfect crispy chicken. There's coleslaw on the waffle and it works, but I'll warn you that it does make the waffle soggy, especially by the end (and I didn't take long to finish eating) :)

It was extremely hot inside when I visited. It made my dining experience uncomfortable, but given I don't see any other reviews mentioning it, maybe the AC/vent had issues only the day I went."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised about this place. When my SO told me we were going to a chicken and waffles place I was flabbergasted. I've never thought those two would go well together, let alone savory waffles. Being from an Asian heritage it's not common. 

The place is almost diner like with their decorations and small settings. It was cozy and the wonderful smells of the kitchen just kept wafting in our direction (not a bad thing). Their signature sauce went extremely well with my jalapeño waffles surprisingly and their chicken was super crispy! Since it wasn't too busy (yet) the manager and the cooks themselves would come over and ask if the food was up to par. We appreciated that they would even bring the food to the table. This was smart because since the place is so small, it didn't make sense having a server. They'd cook it, prepare it and bring it over to the table themselves. 

Definitely going to be a regular whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"If you are humming and hawwing about getting their chicken sandwich...stop it. Just get it or split it with a friend. They bread their chicken with gorgeous spices. Don't sleep on the wedges either. Their fries are great but the wedges are fire.  See our full video review and how they make it here: https://youtu.be/xS1BYUknI6U"}
{"text":"I'm a southern gal from Texas living it up in the T-dot and I can tell you, this is a legit chicken and waffles joint. I had the Motherclucker while my husband had the Cluck Yeah. Both were hands down amazing. A melt in your mouth scrumptious waffle with crispy yet tender chicken, it was amazing. The spicy maple syrup is a crazy twist on your taste buds. Plenty of seating at this place. We went on a Saturday night with my in laws and had our baby in a stroller with us. Great place for families with kids. Service was impeccable! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Best Fried Chicken+waffle in Toronto!

The chicken batter is thin+crisp and meat is suuuper juicy. The waffle is not as crunchy on the outside but very moist and chewy. It seems like they add some sweet rice powder to obtain that chewy goodness. It comes with a spicy honey mustard dipping sauce and that's also really good.

The food is a 5+, better than any chicken place I've been to in Toronto. The only thing is that the restaurant is a bit out of the way and it's really hot inside. No A/C. The kitchen is where the dining area is and the heat from the oil just swarms the whole place. But who cares! The chicken and waffles is great!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going with a 4/5 for 2 reasons: the staff were suuper friendly and accomodating, the little clucker dish was included in TO's finest most recent food crawl. The waffles were a1, the chicken, however, mayyy be a little too oily for your preference. The skin was fried to the T, which I LOVED. But if it hadn't been for the sauce adding flavour to it, the chicken is juuust average. I really couldn't get enough of the waffle though, and the variety of sauces that we were allowed to choose from to go with the dish! P.s. I shared a video I made so peep the media section for 12 seconds of foodgasms. LOL"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were so ready to indulge chicken and waffles on Friday night for dinner. It turned out to be a MEH experience.

My chicken was not even crispy... and the waffles were soggy. Coleslaw was too sweet. Overall, the food was disappointing. 

I will not return. To be honest, it really was one of the worst meals I have had for a while. 
I am giving 2/5 because the staff were nice and friendly.I really wanted to love this place because it is so close to where I am...."}
{"text":"One of my favorite fried chicken and waffles joint in the city. They really hook you up and for a great price. A little hard to find but definitely worth it.."}
{"text":"This week's culinary travels took me to a little hard to find gem in the city.  I went by foot from St. Lawrence market and followed my GPS until I could smell the aroma of fried chicken in the air. 
First impression was that if I didn't already know about this place I would have definitely overlooked it.  The place is pretty small and unassuming.
The service was excellent,  the man at the cash was more then helpful and was very patient with us first timers.  
The names of the different chicken dishes are hilarious!  I went with the Cluck Ya! Sandwich with wedges,  and my friend got the Holy Cluck with side coleslaw. 
The food was brought out to our table with very nice presentation.  Everything was piping hot and fresh.  My sandwich was so tall there was no way I could pick it up,  it's a knife and fork kinda meal.  
Flavors were very nice,  I enjoyed the Chipotle and dill sauces on my sandwich.  The jalapenos baked into my waffle added a really nice spicy kick.  I also really enjoyed my wedges,  nicely fried with a batter and soft fluffy potato inside.  All in all, a quality meal for sure.  Worth the walk!  
Stop by this place for some really great food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. I am from Orlando, Florida and have been to many Chicken and waffle spots across the States. But this place is one of the top 3!!!

From ordering to getting our food! We were greeted by a lady named Miriam who was very patient with us when we told her it was our first time here. She went above and beyond to make sure everyone in the dining room was okay by going around and asking. When she came up to our table she noticed I didn't eat all the waffle and offered sauce. She was very attentive to our needs and wow, what service!

The food was made fresh and to order! The sauces are delicious, we had the Cluck Sauce and the Maple Syrup! Both great choices. (I accidentally was given the spicy maple, but was quickly given a fresh waffle upon realizing the mistake-A+ service).

This place is a hidden gem in Toronto and I would recommend it hands down."}
{"text":"AWESOME SQUARED!

OK this place ... let me tell you!!  I recently moved into the area with my daughter and her bf for Uni and we were thrilled to discover this gem!!  

Visited 3 times so far and looking forward to returning again soon!!  

Firstly - service in this place is SPECTACULAR.  All staff are exceptionally friendly, helpful,  warm and welcoming.  

The menu offers great & fun choices and is not overwhelming.  It makes it easier to come back and try everything!   (creative and fun menu item names too .. love it :) !!)

I tried the Cluck Ya 2xs (it's SPECTACULAR).  A superb jalapeno & cheddar waffle sandwiching two pieces of perfectly cooked chicken ... hells ya baby!!!!  I add a tad of maple syrup to get that savory/sweet experience ...AMAZEBALLS.   My daughter and her bf really enjoy the Holy Cluck and/or the What the Cluck.  Really ... you can't go wrong there.  Homemade delicious sauces to boot, and great side slaw tops the bill.  

We've yet to try dessert but surely that will happen soon .. when we don't fill up on everything else!!  (healthy portions!)

Do yourself a fav and seek out this place.  Totally nice peeps and great fun delicious food.  You just gotta go!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken. There is no better meal than that. Add waffle to it, and you get a strange, yet delicious mix. I went there on a Sunday around 1pm for lunch and the place was crowded with seats difficult to find. We were a group of 5 so it was difficult to find a table that fit all of us.

I took the boneless chicken on waffle, sweet version. The chicken was well well fried, and crispy. The meat was also was also very lean, which is good for them gainz. That didn't prevent to have the guilt post-meal and the urge to work-out to lose all them fat that I just consumed. I will come back to try other meals."}
{"text":"Just to put it out there, confirmed with the owner that the chicken is halal :)

Was there last night, the chicken was perfectly fried, crispy crust and juicy inside, however I do think they could do with more seasoning as somebody else said. The Sauce selection is really good, you get a choice of one sauce, we asked more of that sauce and the owner himself said why don't you try the chipotle sauce, so we did, it was the best out of all the sauces we had (we had three), the cluck signature sauce is good too (its kinda sweety).

There is some creativity behind their food names- Mother Clucker, Cluck Yeah!

I also think they need metal cutleries, but i heard they are not allowed by-law or something, regardless, its kinda hard eating it with plastic.

Will be going there again if i am in the area!"}
{"text":"One of the best fried chicken places Toronto has to  offer. It's hidden away in the less busy part of Toronto the East End. Just a short 10 minute walk from George Brown St James Campus. All the chicken is fresh, crunchy and delicious. It's a small family run shop that cooks fresh chicken everyday to order. The staff appear to be all family and were very attentive and polite.

I had the Mother Clucker (Yes I had a good laugh as well) it was a 3 piece fried chicken meal on top  of a jalapeno cheddar cheese waffle and it was absolutely delicious. The chicken was crunchy from the fryer and the waffle was very crispy. 

For all fried chicken and waffle lovers this is a must try!"}
{"text":"Holy moly this chicken is good. I ordered the 8-pc to share with my husband and have leftovers for tomorrow, along with fries. They ran out of fries (was just before closing), but replaced with wedges which were amazzzzing so we were very happy with the unexpected swap. The chicken was so good that we hardly have enough leftover for one meal tomorrow. Worth every bite. Also we didn't eat lunch so we were extra ravenous. This certainly hit the spot! The chicken was moist, flavorful, and tender (fell off the bone!) inside, while crunchy and deliciously crispy outside. Looking forward to ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, large portions and friendly service. I've tried both the regular and jalapeño waffles, which are pretty spicy. The combos are a bit confusing and the ventilation could be better, but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there and tried chicken waffles for the first time ever. The waffles were kind of sweet and the chicken was tender. Overall a good experience with the food. The portion was huge. Couldn't finish it one go. Good value for the money."}
{"text":"Juicy chicken, friendly staff, and very generous portions! I went on a busy Friday night and after looking at what others got, I went for the 3 piece with waffles. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a hearty meal."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

I went here last week with a group of friends.  It's an unassuming place and when you walk in, holy cluck is it orange everywhere!  I think one of the staff said it used to be a laundry mat.  It has that fast food kinda vibe to it, but the food is anything but fast food.

I had the kid size chicken and waffles with the side of fries (Little Clucker).  The chicken was nice and crispy and juicy but the fries were waaaaay too salty for me.  I could only handle a few unfortunately.  I should have picked the coleslaw as the option for the side.  The combo (with drink) is about $11,  Now even though it's a smaller meal than the other options don't get your feathers in a knot as it is still plenty of food.  Bone in chicken thigh was a fairly big piece and the waffle had a nice doughy warm consistency to it.  

Just looking at the menu and the names they came up with are good for a laugh!  The staff are all really friendly.

This is definitely a place I would cluck about to all my friends who live close by :)"}
{"text":"Nice, friendly staff; fries are pretty good, waffle was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, chicken was flavorful and moist but somehow, the sauce was missing something for us... it did not hit the spot quite like the other chicken and waffles I've had when we visited but it's not bad. We would rate it a 3.5"}
{"text":"I must say, I was very impressed with Cluck Clucks chicken and waffles! The bone in chicken was super juicy and crispy and the waffles were the perfect sweetness! When you put them together it is the perfect combination of sweet, salty and crunchy. I like the fact that you get to pick your sauce, but wished we could pick two. Other than that everything else was delicious and the price point is not that bad. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We absolutly loved this place. I camt say enough how i wished we had found it earlier. This is my mew toronto Brunch spotm the food was yummy, hot, and quick. I just wish they had one of these in Texas."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here. Owner's are known Muslims. Tried the \"Mother Clucker\" which is fried chicken (4 large pieces) over jalapeno cheddar waffles.  Pretty good.  Also tried the \"What the Cluck\" sandwich which is waffle sandwich with fried chicken pieces in between with special sauce.  Very good.  The prices are a little on the high side, but the amount of food and the quality of the food is great and makes up for the cost.  Definitely worth trying if you are in the area."}
{"text":"HALAL!!!!
Juicy crispy chicken and big soft fluffy waffles!
I can't get over how delicious the mix was!
I ended up getting the jalapeno cheddar waffles as I prefer a savory taste over sweet.
One of the best chicken waffle places I've tried. Recently had there \"twaco\" which was delicious as well! I haven't been disappointed in this place so far. The portions are huge! I went during the evening time and it wasn't too busy. It is a small place so I can see it be busy during the weekends.
Price is average, around $12-$15 for a meal.
Will come back for another cheat day meal again :)"}
{"text":"Not recommended.

This place is always very busy, hot and dirty. We ordered a \"What The Cluck\" at $10.49 and \"Cluck Yeah\" at $8.99 with Wedges for $2.99.

We waited for about 20 minutes to get our food and took it to-go because the restaurant itself was very dirty and greasy. I don't think they wipe down their tables or mop the floors.

The food looked and tasted very plain. The fried chicken didn't have any flavour or salt. It was made poorly, the chicken still had feathers and the skin was burnt, or cooked in old oil. The waffle was disappointing. It was not crispy and had no flavour. I didn't end up finishing some of the food, the fries were a bit soggy, it wasn't good enough to eat.

Overpriced. Memorably terrible food. Completely overhyped.
Honestly, this was such a bad experience, I would not give this place another try."}
{"text":"So far I've only had one thing here: the Cluck Yeah.

I don't know how you can top it. It's so insanely delicious with the balance of savoury, sweet, creamy, and crunchy. I can't let myself eat it too often because it can't be good for my diet, but when I want to splurge on some not-so-healthy food it's on. Load it up with some fries or wedges -- you can't go wrong with either. Coleslaw is amazing as well.

They're down with Ritual as well. Some deals for first-time orders and 20x afterwards!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles is everything your life has been missing. I get the holy cluck and it is AMAZING, your in a food coma after and every time I go in their super busy. 

They always get my order right but always forget my sauce, (and always get it for me no problem when I ask)

The fries are amazing too. Such a great little gem!"}
{"text":"This place would be great ... if you haven't had chicken and waffles from THE DIRTY BIRD.

Think of this as the inferior version of TDB.

Will PROBABLY not come back or will only eat here if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"A 40 minute wait for fried chicken on a Tuesday evening. Come on. It wasn't even busy. 
 
So extremely disappointed. Their only excuse? \"It takes time\". 
Yes it takes time to fry chicken. I understand that. 40 minutes though? Come on. It's not like you need michelin calibre plating. 

I had to refill my parking...twice. 

Yikes."}
{"text":"We ordered the mother clucker and cluck yeah and are both very happy with our meal.  Waffles are fluffy and fresh, the jalapeños in the waffles really enhanced the flavours; chicken was nicely fried, not too oily. Friendly and kind staff.  Had old school Nsync playing haha Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"While coming back from Distillery District today I realized that Cluck Clucks was just a few steps away. It was on my bookmarks list very long so thought to give it a shot today.

When you are a couple 100 meters away from the restaurant you can smell the delicious fried chicken, so just follow the aroma and you will land in the right place.As you enter you see a very casual atmosphere with a few tables up for grabs. 

We ordered a Cluck Yeah!! Combo with a side of fries and 2 pc fried chicken with a side of wedges.
Fried chicken was mind-blowing, super juicy and crispy, very well seasoned and perfectly cooked. 
Clucks Yeah sandwich again the chicken was super flavourful, tender, juicy and cooked to perfection but for my waffle I would prefer it a little bit more in the savoury side. It was a little sweet for me though I don't think they put lots of sugar in it. However my preference for a chicken waffle sandwich is no sugar at all.

Apart from that everything was superb. Will come back whenever I am around."}
{"text":"So --- this place is totally low key.
No rez required.
But OMG - love the Chicken and Waffles.
We had the Boneless Chicken Breast.
Do think twice before you had fries --- it is a serving fit for only the most hungry.

Staff are friendly and service was quick.
Food is made to order.

Couple of notes:
- Entrance is on the side street not Esplanade. 
- Right now there is scaffolding outside -- so hard to see the entrance
- Green P parking is close by"}
{"text":"Really great place, it's halal and has some delicious waffles, for sure! I had the Cluck Yeah and it was amazing, shared it with another person with some fries and it completely filled us up. 
Would reccomend sandwiches over other stuff like the Little Clucker, way more flavor in the sandwich.
Staff is super friendly, we went on a weekday and it wasn't very full."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall looking place, we came here looking for something different and as other reviews stated, \"the best chicken and waffles.\" We were greeted by friendly staff who helped us pick out our meal - we ordered the \"cluck yeah\" sandwich, which was a jalapeño waffle sandwich with fried chicken, coleslaw and their special sauce, and a side of fries. The meal was large and definitely enough for two to split. Everything was very tasty and came out fast and piping hot. 

Our only complaint was that this is NOT the place to go if you are looking to escape the heat. It was about 10 degrees HOTTER inside than outside (and it was 90 outside!) due to the friers and stoves and the workers looked like they were about dying, not to mention we were dripping while eating. Keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good chicken and waffles, this is the place to go. I tried the Cluck Yea, the jalapeño and cheddar waffle is delish, along with the chipotle aioli. I was a little disappointed with the wedges, they tasted fine but there was probably a total of 7 wedges with my order. Overall, food and staff were both great."}
{"text":"A great addition to the neighbourhood and not a bad spot either that does need some improvement but hopefully that changes once they start getting the hang of things 

The interior is really nice compared to other places on esplanade. It's fresh and clean with lots of tables, seating and a TV. 

The chicken was okay. I mean, its not going to make any of the fried chicken lists but its a good alternative if you don't want popeyes or KFC. It doesn't compare to Kanpai at all. I do think the chicken needs some seasoning. Actually, it does need some seasoning and you'll be good to go. I hope they chnage up the recipe

I didn't get the waffles so I can't comment on that. I got the fries and they weren't good. Soggy and greasy. It was basically cooked and fried potato with no substance or crunch. Blah."}
{"text":"I'm going to give a brutally honest review of this place.

Firstly, the location. It is hot as hell in here. They have no AC. I spotted a couple fans blowing on the floor but that is it. For a place frying chicken and somewhat bustling, it's kind of annoying. The tables are meant for groups so as you wait there are a few stools. If you don't get one of those, find a corner and stand. I had to use the washroom so I got to experience that joy as well. The floors in the bathroom are gross and slimy. I think this has something to do with nothing being under the soap dispenser so when you pump, the soap falls into your hand and the rest onto the floor. The toilet didn't flush well. So I had to flush about 15 times before it actually emptied. 

Secondly, the service. My ordering experience was fine. I wanted more than 3 pieces, so I got the 8 piece deal. The guy at the front recommended it. What wasn't great was about 15 minutes later realizing my food hadn't come out and it wasn't coming out anytime soon. There were so many people who were ahead of me still waiting. Between foodora, ritual, uber eats, and actual walk in customers this place was grossly overwhelmed. People were getting irritated as the wait time wasn't being communicated to anyone and everyone was just standing there. I witnessed a lady ask for her order, get her order, come back and say she got wedges with her order, told it was in there, left and came back insisting there were no wedges in the container, before she was finally taken seriously and her order was fixed and she got what she paid for. I ended up waiting half an hour for my food & got a free container of fries for it. It's very obvious they are overextending themselves and I get the business of wanting to supply all the demand but c'mon.

Thirdly, the food. It is not worth your time, money, or effort. I know we are in Toronto and good options for fried chicken are scarce but this is absolutely not it. The chicken I got had a semi burnt (?) taste to it which was really unappealing. But to make it worse it really lacked flavour. Anyone who knows good fried chicken knows you have to season it thoroughly, this is not at all. It is bland! I tried two sauces, the cluck sauce and the hot sauce. Their hot sauce taste quite strange and I really question how that flavour profile goes with fried chicken. The cluck sauce, though a little sweet is decent. I liked it. The free fries they threw in for making me wait half a hour were disgusting. I don't really eat potatoes but had a couple and they tasted old and soggy.

Basically, if you want barely mediocre food, at a overhyped Toronto takeout joint, this is for you. I can't find any redeeming qualities to add. The prices are steep, which wouldn't be an issue to me if the food quality and overall experience (level of service/quality of location) matched. One star for the food being cooked and the guy who took my order being polite. 

People in Toronto really have to stop being misleading about \"good\" food. Sometimes you just don't know good food because you have mediocrity too often."}
{"text":"I didn't think that I was a chicken and waffles kinda person, but boy was I wrong! This place is amazingggggg!! I loved my first time there and am already thinking about when to go next(soon)! Also, it's halal- bonus points. The location is a little off, it's within close proximity of the Distillery District, but hard to spot as it is a fairly small restaurant with a small sign board. Anyway, definitely order the cluck yeah- boneless chicken sandwiched in between spicy jalepeno waffles. You won't regret it. Personally, i would suggest boneless because you can hold it like a burger and eat the whole thing, but you can also try bone in chicken. They add coleslaw inside the sandwich, an interesting touch and different as I am used to receiving it on the side in KFC. The atmosphere is laid back and the restaurant is very clean. Went in on a sunday an hour before closing so luckily there was no line up, but I have heard that there is a long one, even on weeknights! Definitely a must go to in Downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Best little find, hands down!! Staff was helpful of explaining menu, food was fantastic, atmosphere was super fun with great music. Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing! I got delivery service and the chicken was out of this world. Juicy, flavourful, great portions, definitely best I've had in a while. The waffles are a bit chewy for my liking, a bit \"underdone\" but I fixed it by sticking it in the oven for a little bit. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in town.  Good desert menu, friendly staff.  Seating area is a bit limited otherwise great place."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Enjoyed the chicken a lot though some others in our group commented that it was a bit over fried. It did seem like the chicken was double fried but since I prefer it extra crispy so it holds up under sauce, I really liked it. The waffle was another story. A bit too chewy for my taste and not enough flavour."}
{"text":"Definitely the best chicken and waffles I've had in Toronto!!! I think it's more of a take out spot but there are seats if you wanna eat in. I'd recommend it over any other chicken and waffles spot in the city, it's a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles in town! Absolutely love this place. You get fresh hot food! There are no freezers in this place. Also love their quirky branding. Must try the cluck yeah and the mother clucker from the menu"}
{"text":"Cluck Clucks combines the famous pairing of Chicken and Waffles into a casual premium fast food style restaurant with mediocre results. 

I came to Cluck Clucks incredibly eager to try them out, the restaurant looked great and at least from a design perspective was appealing. The variety on the menu was mostly just where on the chicken the meat came from if it had a bone in it. I went with the Holy Cluck combo which was a boneless fried chicken breast with a waffle, fries, and a sauce (I went with chipotle aioli). My eagerness died after my first bite when I realized it was just \"fine\" with some big problems on the two things they should do best, the chicken and the waffle. The chicken was not particularly crispy or flavourful, and the inside was dry enough that I had to struggle to cut it with the plastic knife they provided. The waffle also had the same problem and although it tasted pretty good, it felt dry or stale, like it wasn't made fresh for my meal. The meal wasn't all bad though, the fries were fried well and tasty and the sauce was surprisingly good, I'm not sure if it's a generic sauce but the chipotle aioli was the best part of the meal and helped cover the dryness of the chicken and waffle.

There seem to be a lot of positive reviews on here so I might give them another shot one day, from my experience I found it to be acceptable, but I definitely left disappointed."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered delivery from Cluck Clucks so I never wrote a review but I finally stepped food into their restaurant and I was not let down. I already knew their food is delicious but their service and cleanliness of the restaurant was very welcomed. It's probably the best fried chicken I've had in the city and they do waffles better than most people."}
{"text":"Delish - you can tell the food is fresh & see them butchering chicken in open-concept kitchen.   Very clean & a nice little family owned business.  Not much to complain about over here.  The array of sauces is great too as I have a thing for dip."}
{"text":"My bf and I were going to be in the downtown area to meet up with friends, so were decided to swing by to see what all the hype was about.  (We are chicken and waffle lovers, so it only makes sense, right?)

The place was bright and clean.  For a nice day in the middle of the week in mid-afternoon, I would say there was a decent amount of customers.  The woman behind the counter was patient and helpful in the ordering process.  I ended up ordering the \"Mother Clucker\" and my bf ordered the \"Cluck Yeah!\"  

As we anxiously waited (and salivated), we debated which sauces would best compliment each of our orders.  And shortly thereafter, our order was ready.

Not only was it presented well (for a fast food type place), it looked and smelled great!  But the real test is how did it taste?  Well...the chicken was juicy and tender, lightly battered and well-seasoned and the jalapeno and cheddar waffle was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  The fries...well, they're fries.

Overall, good portion size, nice service and yummy food with a bit of a kick!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a co-worker who only eats only Halal food and is very selective about where he eats.  So figured I'd give it a try since I haven't had chicken and waffles in a minute.

Getting to this place during the start of rush hour was a mission.  Navigating through one way streets and no left turns during certain times of the day.  Gotta love our city!  Finally came across the address posted which was 222 The Esplanade, in reality should have a little note facing Princess Street.

Okay on to the good stuff.  I looked over the menu and right away very simple and easy to understand.  Loved the names of each menu item, seems like something I would do if I owned my own chicken joint.  Decided on the \"Cluck Yeah\" since I prefer boneless chicken if I'm eating it in a sandwich.  Placed the order with the gentleman at the counter and waited for about 10 minutes.  Food was ready to go and since I was taking it out I rushed back to work to feast on the glorious chicken and waffle package I just received.

The sandwich was on point, so many different flavors in every bite.  The boneless chicken was so juicy and there was plenty of it.  The waffle had just the right amount of cheese and jalapeno in it and the mayo was the icing on the entire meal!  Honorable mention to the side of coleslaw that was provided.  Usually not my favorite part of a meal but it tasted very fresh.

Will I go back here again?  Cluckin' right I will!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today as part of TO's Finest food passport and wasn't disappointed. The Little Clucker was enough to leave me feeling full, but not ready for a nap...

A side of Cluck Sauce was the perfect mix of tangy and sweet with a little kick."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery via Foodora. Wasn't expecting much since I know what to expect when you order fried foods for delivery. 

We ordered the Mother Clucker combo with the cluck sauce and the MC hot sauce on the side and everything was delicious!  I definitely like it more than Dirty Bird in Kensington Market. 

The chicken was tasty and the batter was light. The Cluck sauce is good but I have no idea what's in it. Haha. But it has a good vinegar and spice kick, yet it's creamy. The MC hot sauce is fantastic. It's not a Frank's hot sauce. It's a spicy habanero spice. Soooo good. 

The jalapeño and cheddar waffle was delicious!

I'll try this place again at the store and perhaps that would move the rating to 5 stars if I get everything fresh!"}
{"text":"Had the \"What the Cluck\", 2 bone in pieces on a waffle and a side of potato wedges.  The chicken was seasoned nicely with a light batter.  Fried up nicely making the skin a little crispy.  Waffles made to order so they were hot, light and fluffy.  Great experience and will definitely want to visit again."}
{"text":"My first meal in Toronto and it was a doozy. I feel like chicken and waffles is more than just a passing trend, chicken and waffles is a way of life and Cluck Cluck's is an institute of amazingness!

Hungry, I was so hungry and kept trying my hardest as to what to eat. Ever be in those moods where you are so hungry but don't know what you want? That was me, but then I just sort of gave up and found myself in front of Cluck Cluck's. Divine intervention I suppose.

I ordered the chick and jalepeno waffle and some coleslaw. I sat down and I waited patiently for my meal.

You guys, this place smelled so good. Like amazing chicken grease. May be gross to some, buy not me.

I got my food and i completely dug in. Lord, this was such a great meal. The jalepeno's were baked into that warrm and fluffy waffle. And the chicken was nice and juicy and had the best, best, best crunchy, flaky breading on it. I don't think I stopped for ait the entire time.

Literally a finger licking good meal (sorry for any copyright infringement). But such a good meal.

I paid around $19 CAD for my meal but I left completely stuffed and ordered enough food for two people, but that's just me. Go here if you're in the area and get that wafffle!"}
{"text":"Tried the Cluck Yeah sandwich and my hubby had the 2 piece of chicken + waffle with the spicy mayo sauce. The chicken is very moist and flavourful and I really like that they cook it to order. The Cluck Yeah is hard to eat as a sandwich so i was cutting into it. I dunno if it needs both creamy sauces (maybe 1 creamy sauce and another to change things up a bit, as the 2 creamy sauces they used so of meld together) but it was tasty. The jalepeno cheddar waffle used in the sandwich is also unique. The waffle was fluffy and light. I would def come back."}
{"text":"Service 4* Food 4* Ambiance 3*
Best fried chicken I've had. FRESHER then a MOTHERCLUCKER everything was so fresh.
Waffles were amazing. It's a little $$$ for some. Well worth it to me. 
It wasn't busy, so service could vary. One of the owners was very friendly and we were well looked after. 
There isn't a lot of options for obvious reasons. Definitely worth a try and worth the indulgence. A better location would be nice. 
Try it out and support this local business their really doing their best. Once again consistency is important. It's not known for ambiance but it's very clean and a lot of space. 
See pictures for what we had.
Coleslaw was really good too. 
( reviewed on March 8/16)"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I had the cluck yeah and holy cluck it was amazing. The service was incredible. The staff was very friendly. One of the best places in Toronto. Must visit if you're in the city."}
{"text":"The fried chicken at Cluck Clucks is very good. The chicken is moist and seasoned really well without it being too salty. The waffles have a nice vanilla favour to it. We tried the cluck sauce which was described to us as \"sweet and tangy\". I found it slightly too spicy for me. 

The only problem is that there is no AC. We went on a hot summer day and with the fryers going, the heat was almost unbearable. There is a park with benches nearby which may be a better alternative to families with small children."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were really good. Great option if you're sick of the usual fast food joints in the city."}
{"text":"The crispiest fried chicken I've ever had! I had this delivered to my condo, so I cannot say much for the actual restaurant/dine in experience, but I'm so amazed by the freshness and crispiness of the fried chicken, especially after the 50 minute delivery time!

Normally I receive my delivered chicken a soggy mess--not from Cluck Clucks! Each piece was hot, fresh, and irresistibly crispy. The flavor and texture were both top notch. Will definitely be ordering more often!"}
{"text":"Going through some of the reviews just absolutely made my mouth water. Finally decided to go with their 8 piece and a side of coleslaw. Placed an order on foodora to have this delivered as I was not feeling the need to step outside in the blizzard. 

Food arrived quickly and to my surprise the chicken was still scorching hot and crispy! The skin appeared to be burnt but it tasted spectacular. Well seasoned. The coleslaw was disappointing in portion size but that was also delicious. Definitely curious to step into the store one day when the weather permits!"}
{"text":"So, I'm starting this review now before I have my chicken because I've been sitting for half an hour in a sweltering hot restaurant waiting for my food and it's not even that crowded.  It's clear they're more interested in delivery business because I've seen 2 orders go out the door and 2 more Foodora guys here waiting (wait, one of them just got their haul of food to take away!). It's getting to the point where I don't care how good this food is....this is absurd for a \"quick service\" restaurant.

28 minutes to get some chicken...

I'm still trying to be objective here...and it's very underwhelming.  I don't get all the raving reviews. I had the Holy Cluck, which seems to be their most popular.  The chicken is dry and pretty bland...any Popeyes would taste better.  The waffles were rubbery and I made the mistake of getting the cheddar jalapeño variant.  Couldn't find any cheddar and only a few random chunks of pickled jalapeño that ruined it.  The \"signature\" cluck sauce tasted like watered down salad dressing and the tobasco sauce they have tastes like it's been sitting in a hot gym locker for weeks.  I know they say it can't go bad...but they are clearly testing that theory.

The manager (I presume) who must have noticed I wasn't thrilled with my wait time came over to just tell me that next time, I should order ahead.  No offer to do anything...apparently it's my problem.  There won't be a next time."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on Valentines Day, and despite not serving chicken fingers, I felt the need to write an amazing review for this place because 1) The chicken was so damn delicious and tender and 2) Because I hope that me writing this review would inspire Cluck Clucks to actually start serving chicken fingers as well ;)

When I came here, my boyfriend and I both had the \"Cluck Yeah!\" which was basically boneless chicken breast in between a fresh jalapeno and cheddar waffle with coleslaw, chipotle aioli, and dill mayo. The waffle was soft and definitely very fresh. I liked the unique blend of jalapeno cheddar...I am the type of person who typically leaves some of the bun behind when I am starting to feel full, but not here...I devoured everything! I also liked that the batter stayed on the chicken instead of coming right off. I loved this place so much that I am honestly wishing that I was in Toronto right now so that I could go get some! 

The only downside to this venue was the line up. It was crazy busy in there...and took us nearly 25 minutes to get our food. The establishment is also quite small so if you want to eat there definitely try grabbing a table before getting your food. I also found everything to be quite pricy (it costed like $30 for two of us to eat...which is a bit much considering this place is \"fast food\"). Despite this, the amazing and FRESH chicken makes up for everything!

{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. I wasn't expecting all that much from this place. Maybe because it lacked that gimmicky, hipster-rawness that I've come to expect from chicken and waffles, but Cluck Cluck's executed. The chicken was flavourful, crispy and tender. I even committed to finishing the entire waffle, which usually ends up left behind based on being bland and repetitive. One of the better chicken and waffles I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"\"Cluck Yeah\" Sandwich 
Boneless chicken was amazing. Toppings in the sandwich all fit perfectly and provided a great mix of flavours. Coleslaw & Chipotle aioli 

Im not usually a waffle person but this waffle was amazing. The jalapenos in the waffles was a game changer.

Would definitely recommend for anyone!"}
{"text":"Great fried chicken. Great price. The only complaint I have is that every time I ordered coleslaw as the side, it was missing from the package. It happened twice. I ordered to go, so I never bothered to go back to ask for it. I just wish they could have paid more attention. Great food, though."}
{"text":"A small casual eatery tucked away on the far east side of St Lawrence market area with great tasting fried chicken and waffles! 

I ordered the \"Cluck Yeah\" fried chicken waffle, which took about 5-10 minutes to prepare. The waffle was nicely crispy, lightly sweet, and the jalapeños in it gave it a very nice kick. The fried chicken was tender and moist with a nice crispy batter. Definitely one of the better fried chicken waffles I have had in the city!

The only improvement I can think of would be to have a location closer to the downtown main core area."}
{"text":"Hell yes.

LITTLE CLUCKER comes with one thigh, waffle, sauce, side and drink combo $11 and it filled me up pretty good (I did eat a little beforehand) but damn it was so good. 

50¢ for an extra sauce. You gotta get one sauce for the meat and one maple syrup to get that salty and sweet meal. So worth it. 

I would definitely make a trip back here again. Service was quick, prompt and great. Very impressed and happy with everything. 

There's seating and a washroom to wash your greasy hands when you're done, so don't worry. If you plan to take it outside there's a nice park to eat at. 

It was cluckin' gooooooood."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken and waffles and great service too! Try the cluck yeah with a side of maple syrup for dunking or the holy cluck with cluck sauce. So good... Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I visited Cluck Cluck's recently after my first time and the quality is pretty consistent. 

We had the Holy Chuck (one boneless chicken breast with waffles). The meat was flavourful; outside was crispy yet still juicy inside. We also had the Mother Clucker (3-piece bone in fried chicken with waffles). I opted for just with cheddar cheese without the Jalapeño. The bone-in chicken was even more juicier than the breast. The only hiccup was the I asked for a non-spicy sauce, but they still gave me the one with spice. 

It took awhile to get the food cooked since they made to order. I would definitely go back for the juicy fried chicken if I am in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Do you like falling asleep soon after eating your meals?  Do you love using cuss words to describe your food? Do you like fried chicken and waffles...(who doesn't like chicken & waffles!???) Well then Cluck Clucks is the place for you =)

Thanks to a prompt and polite response from Raza the owner of Cluck clucks after my initial not-so-great review of the place, I'm happy to say my second visit here was emphatically delicious. 

I had the opportunity to enjoy two of Cluck Clucks most popular meals which are the cleverly if not cheekily named the \"Cluck Yeah\" and \"Mother Clucker\". Cholesterol levels and calorie counting be damned, indulging in these clucking delights is the stuff of the most depraved gastronomic sins. 

The Mother Clucker is 3 pieces of succulent chicken served alongside the most perfectly executed ratio of  fluffy/chewy waffles that are teasingly spiked with jalapeños and cheddar. The pièce de résistance is undoubtedly the Cluck Yeah with juicy boneless fried chicken sandwiched between those perfect waffles slathered with Dill Aioli (yes please!) and a nice spread of coleslaw to boot! 

I wholeheartedly recommend Cluck Clucks for their unique take on delicious comfort food along with their exceptionally customer friendly service
So what the cluck are you waiting for? Go get some clucking amazing chicken and waffles from Cluck Clucks already!"}
{"text":"Thought this place would be a bit of a mission to get to, but it's actually relatively close to Union Station, so I decided to try it out. 

Chicken + Waffles = Magic. That's what you get when you mix 2 comfort foods together. Magic. 

The store is quite spacious with lots of seating and you're immediately hit with the aroma of fried chicken...mmmmmm. When you enter, you're greeted by the staff and can view a large menu on the wall. The chicken here is also halal.

One of my fellow Yelpers kept raving about this place and they were right! After the approximately 10 minute wait, you are served with beautifully crisp chicken and fresh waffles served with your choice of sauce. I believe I chose some variant of a spicy mayo which was delicious. 

I got the white meat chicken and it was fresh and tasty. You can also order sides and have a choice of how you want it presented (i.e. On top of a waffle, as a sandwich etc). I opted for just the chicken and waffles, so I can't comment on the fires. I'm glad everything is made fresh to order - you can really tell the effort put into the meal. The pricing to portion value is not bad either! 

Cluck Clucks is a solid choice whenever you're downtown. I look forward to returning, hungry for more!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has sucha high rating, we had a horrible experience. We ordered on Ritual, when we went to pick it up it weren't ready yet. When we went back home to eat (we live upstairs in the building) and opened the box, i saw that there were FEATHERS on my chicken. The fries (if i can even call it that)  we got were all left over soggy bits. Very disappointed, especially since we pass by it so often."}
{"text":"Short summary: Fastfood quality without the fastfood service speed. 

We wanted to go someplace close to the Distillery and after seeing the reviews and hearing about this new place, my friends and I walked over here for lunch.

The place: The inside of the restaurant is more like a fast food/cafeteria type of interior. You go up to the counter to order and sit anywhere you want. The space is big but the tables are spread apart, which seems like a bit of wasted space.

Service: We were trying to decide between all the choices so the lady at the counter gave us some good suggestions. The 3 of us got the Twacos, Cluck Yeah and Little Clucker with wedges to share. 

Food:This was the first chicken and waffle place I've been to in Toronto, and the best one I've been to so far has the Tuc kitchen in Vancouver. 

The presentation of twacos looks epic but the taste of all the waffles was mediocre, something we could probably just make at home. It wasn't really light/airy or crunchy, just a bit on the doughy side. 

Out of all 3 dishes, the plain chicken thigh without any dressing from Little Clucker was the best. Twacos was good but too hard to eat and a bit heavy on the dressing. Wedges were crispy and fresh from the fryer and we got sweet heat and the clucker sauce to go with it. Sweet heat is literally just maple syrup with a bit of a kick. 

Probably won't bother going again if I were back in Toronto. It made me miss Tuc in Vancouver instead."}
{"text":"Wow! Finally a halal chicken and waffles restaurant! 

Service: They all seemed very nice and gave us recommendations based on our likings

Food: we ordered #5: Cluck Yeah. My wedges were undercooked. The chicken was cooked to perfection and had the write amount of flavour. I was blown away by the cheddar and jalapeño flavour in the waffles. It had a good kick and was really filling! 

Ambiance: like any other fast food restaurant. Unfortunately the tables were sticky and dirty. 


I'm definitely going back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"The number five sandwich was worth waiting for cluck year was incredible tasting sandwich that I would definitely do again great experience friendly staff really enjoyed myself please spend your money at this location."}
{"text":"Light crispy exterior with juicy chicken is the correct formula to a delicious deep fried chicken. Cluck Cluck has it all, deep fried chicken, perfect waffles and delicious coleslaw.

If you order with your Ritual app, you can redeem points and get some discounts with your order. So check out your app when you're thinking of going to Cluck Cluck.

Definitely check this place out if you're craving deep fried chicken. The service here is awesome too!"}
{"text":"The waffles were amazing. Definitely worth going just to eat them. The fried waffles with cinnamon sugar are something else. Not greasy and the perfect complement to crispy fried chicken."}
{"text":"Found a new place by my work for lunch! I think Cluck Clucks is better and less greasy version of The Dirty Bird. The prices were also a better value for a similar portion. I didn't have a problem with the plastic forks/knives as others mentioned (maybe I'm just gentle).  However, I do know there are plastic utensils that are clear and more sturdy than the ones they have - maybe they can look into that.
I got the 2 piece chicken which comes with a side (because I didn't want a waffle).  The portion was so large that I had trouble finishing it.  Try the chipotle aioli sauce! Yum! 
Staff is friendly and helpful. Will be back here from time to time since it's just around the corner from my office!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken breast with jalapeño cheddar waffle. It was awesome. The chicken was juicy on the inside and the crunchy on the outside. The waffle was very tasty and it made my first night in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Chicken was great!  Delicious and juicy.  It is a \"fast food\" joint with seating.  The lady at the cash was very friendly.

It looked a bit \"cheap\" but the chicken was really good--great for quick eat :). I wanted to try the taco version of it but it was quite pricy--along with the chicken and waffle considering it wasn't a 'restaurant.'  Waffle and chicken was $16.99 and the chicken taco (which was ginormous) was $14.99.

Worth the try for sure since service and food was great"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the chicken was great! Jalapeño waffles also went well with honey garlic sauce!"}
{"text":"Cluck Clucks is a purveyor of fried chicken and waffles in the St. Lawrence area on the east side of downtown Toronto. Just steps from The Esplanade, they serve a community-based clientele.

The interior is brightly decorated, casual, and comfortable. The owner is usually on site helping customers and is polite and friendly. Meals can take up to 10 minutes to prepare on average, but it's well worth the wait. All comfort food connoisseurs should check this place out at least once.

Must-try items:
Cluck Yeah! w/ Potato Wedges
Mother Clucker
Chicken by the piece
Clucking Little Waffles

The bone-in chicken tastes very succulent, and the boneless meat is tender and moist. The jalapeno waffle that comes with the Cluck Yeah! has a unique savoury flavour to it. I find most of the menu items to be satisfying and delicious. The chicken and waffles here definitely gives competitors a run for their money."}
{"text":"We ordered the Holy Cluck and Cluck Yeah. The waffles were cooked perfectly and the chicken was fresh and moist. I was a fan of the dill mayo - very flavourful. The staff were great too - came over to us to make sure everything was okay.

Both waffles were very good - on par with Dirty Bird in Kensington but much better value. We'd come here again!"}
{"text":"Like many others I was unsure about the combination of chicken and waffles together. It was amazing though. I had the chicken waffle sandwich and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Cluck Clucks is just so good! Perfectly prepared fried chicken so light, crispy and juicy. I usually not a lover of deep fried food but if it is so delicious it worth every single calories.

Mother Clucker: Fresh Jalapeno & Cheddar Waffle ($12.99)

Staff here is so friendly and welcoming. Every order is cook when order so there would be 15- 20 minute wait. 

Waffles was OK but the main attraction is definitely the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Cluck Cluck ( your Chicken and Waffles creation ) you have made my mouth experience an amazing tour of duty. I will be back please never change as you will grow fast."}
{"text":"For a person having chicken and waffles for the first time, Cluck Clucks left a great first impression. The chicken was amazing! Well seasoned, definitely would go again just for it. The waffles are good too, fluffy and warm, the combo is surely an acquired taste. I ordered \"Holy Cluck\" with sweet heat and hand cut wedges. The hand cut wedges are not so great. They are a bit shy of the size of an iPhone 7, only ate two to three. The staff is kind, the ambiance is very chill. If chicken and waffles is your cup of tea, go to Cluck Clucks!"}
{"text":"This joint located near St. Laurance market.
Finding parking could be a little hassle.

Food: 
Waffles were perfectly done. Had a hint of maple syrup in better which made the waffles chrispy.
Fried chicken we're also great. Perfectly battered seasoned and juicy inside.
French fries and wedges were complete disappointment. Overcooked fries left a bitter after taste.
 Cluck yeah! Which is Boneless Chicken Breast In Between A Fresh Jalapeno And Cheddar Waffle With Coleslaw, Chipotle Aioli, Dill Mayo
This was by far was best out of whole menu.
Dressing and coleslaw were appreciately compare to the chicken and waffle size."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 7pm and all the tables were already taken. It's a small food joint where you go up to order and they'll bring you your food. Their menu is pretty small  with mostly fried chicken and waffles, sides and some desserts.  The wait for the food was a bit long but they make everything fresh to order so it's worth the wait   We tried the Mother Clucker and What The Cluck, one with fries one with potato wedges.  The jalapeno and cheese waffle didn't do much for me. I could've done without it. I preferred the plain waffle.  The waffle was fluffy on the inside but it could've done with more crisp on the outside.  The chicken was definitely the best part. The skin was crispy, not overly greasy and the meat was very moist.    We got the Cluck sauce and Sweet heat.  Cluck sauce suited the chicken and waffles flavours well and it's not spicy at all.  For dessert we got the Clucking Little Waffies which were fried waffles with Nutella and maple syrup.  They tasted like donuts but with a crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. They are quite delicious.  It's not a very convenient location but I'd definitely come back again, but maybe just order chicken only."}
{"text":"Giving this place 2 stars as I found it inconsistent.  The first time I went there, I ordered the mother clucker (jalapeno waffle and 3 piece chicken).  The chicken was perfectly done (crispy skin and moist flesh) while the waffle had the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  This experience was 3.5 stars.

The next time I went, I ordered a 10 piece and a 3 piece to take to a family gathering.  I ordered through ritual so it was ready/all packed by the time I arrived.  When I arrived home, i found the chicken was really dark (maybe refried?) and meat to be very dry.  As I paid $30+, I was not happy.  This experience was 0 stars.

If I were to go back, I would definitely dine in or check the chicken before I leave."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times it was delic!  I ordered the cluck yeah.  It's quite filling.  The potatoes wedges are massive and could not finish them.  It took about 15mins or so to get our order on a Saturday night.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"3.5/5
Chicken was tender, waffle was fine. They didn't have the sweet heat sauce when we went :( The place is decently priced and pretty quick to serve. Staff are friendly. I don't think it's my favourite chicken and waffle place but it was good. Ambiance is casual and cherry, they have a nice orange colour scheme going on. It's a bit out of the way from the downtown core but quite close to the distillery district. Good if you're craving a quick chicken and waffle haha"}
{"text":"Nothing special. I had the 3 piece chicken with wedges and it was just okay. Good location with curb side parking and places to lock your bike. Clean interior and personable employees. I really like the crunchy texture of the wedges though they were almost flavourless. The chicken was cooked well and nicely seasoned. I went at the end of the day so maybe the oil was dirty, but there was a off taste like old oil. 

Anyway, id go back again if someone else suggests it."}
{"text":"Strong birds!!!! Moist and tasty. The waffles were solid. My other chicken place in Toronto is Bar Fancy."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly, the meal was delicious and reasonably priced with both eat in and take out available. I ordered the three piece chicken and waffle meal with a side of fries. It was delicious, the chicken had a nice spice and the waffle was nice and thick with just enough syrup. I'll for sure be visiting them again."}
{"text":"Juicy and large pieces of chicken were super tasty! Waffle and fries were also really good. Service was quick as well. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Such a cute little joint tucked away at Princess and The Esplanade! The cashier was amazing at recommending the best choices on their menu. It is a small menu but nonetheless very exciting. They offer the traditional dark meat fried or a more healthy option, the chicken breast fried. Either way, both were served on a Waffle with a side and a drink. The options for sides were Fries, Wedges and Coleslaw. We opted for the wedges but now thinking back, I want to try to the coleslaw next time! The chicken breast option was given an additional option to make it into a sandwich. I did prefer an open face waffle then the sandwich. 

This was definitely a must try as the fried chicken was tender and flaky, way better then KFC. The sauces were amazing as well, I definitely recommend the Chipotle Aioli and the Cluck sauce which has a sweet note. This Chicken and Waffles is definitely better than The Stockyards!"}
{"text":"3.5

Somewhat a hidden gem.  

I think the key to their success is that they make their chicken fresh to order.  
It may take 10-15 minutes but it comes out hot and juicy every time.

My waffle however became all cold and soft.   But it was okay because the chicken made up for it.   slightly sweet waffle and very heavy.  definitely was not a light meal."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend last week for lunch. 
I had the two piece leg and thigh combo with cluck sauce. Firstly, the chicken is made to order so you have to wait a bit but I prefer that than food sitting under a heat lamp. The fried chicken coating was absolutely delicious however the waffle was a little sweet for my liking. My friend who had the chicken breast said the coating was different and not as tasty. The cluck sauce was super delicious. 

I would go back."}
{"text":"Of all the fried chicken and waffle places I've been to in Toronto, this one is the best, both quality and price wise! The food is mouth-wateringly delicious, the atmosphere is casual and upbeat, and the owner, Raza, is super-friendly. This is the place to go for halal fried chicken and waffles!

I've been going to this hidden gem since they first opened (so this is a long overdue review). I usually order either the first combo, or two pieced of chicken. The food is consistently high quality, and Raza is always a pleasure to talk to. 

Last year on one Feb night I went in for a takeout. Valentine's day was just around the corner and I joked with Raza that they could celebrate by \"..well, I don't know, make the fried chicken into a heart shape or something\". I went home with my takeout, and when I opened the box, lo and behold, there's the heart-shaped chicken. Most unique Valentine's \"gift\" ever!"}
{"text":"My first chicken waffle. Have to be honest I was very hesitant to try. The sweet and salivary are so well together. The chicken was not too heavy. Perfect combination !"}
