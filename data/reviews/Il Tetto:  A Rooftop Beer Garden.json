{"text":"Sienna Mercato's Il Tetto is Open: Let's Shout It From the Rooftop!

I am infatuated with delicious eats, but I'm a sucker for ambience.  Find me a place that has both, and I will be your number one customer.  I'm excited to say that the visionaries behind Sienna Mercato are now two for two with the recent opening of Il Tetto.  Now you have the mother of all dilemmas.  Will you get your meatball on at Emporio (located on the first floor) before or after you take the elevator ride to Il Tetto's gorgeous rooftop beer garden? 

As some of you know I've been anticipating the opening of Il Tetto for some time.  As the cosmos would have it, their second night in operation just happened to be my birthday.  No lie, I was a tad nervous bringing my band of friends to a locale I had never been before, but the idea of a spacious rooftop bar in downtown was just too darn tempting to pass up.  My imagination had nothing on this place.  Upon exiting the elevator, my jaw dropped a bit.  The rain had stayed at bay, allowing the retractable glass ceiling to reveal a portion of the city's skyline and a pleasant nighttime breeze.  Seating options varied from cozy nooks to sizable party tables.  The bar, which lined an entire stretch of wall, was inviting as well.  No matter where you sit, be sure to look up and admire the gas lamps and charming strings of lights.  The décor is pleasing to most anyone I'd wager, from sports fans (there were several TVs playing the Buccos game) to those seeking a romantic rendezvous and anyone in between. 

 So, Il Tetto is picturesque, you get it.  But looks will only get you so far (as my grandma loved to remind me when I'd get \"gussied up.\")  I needed to get my hands on a birthday libation.  Lucky for me, the draft list is equally as impressive as Emporio's.  The reason?  Each of the 32 drafts that are downstairs are piped up to Il Tetto's bar.  You can also imbibe on wine and specialty cocktails if you prefer. 

In regards to food, the menu provides a select list of small plates ranging from munchies like house-made Pork Rinds to heavier dishes like the Duck Confit Steak Fries.  We ordered the latter.  The fries were crisp, yet tender and the duck fat gravy added a velvety richness to the plentiful shreds of duck meat.  The topping of a sunny side-up egg added yet another level of richness and texture.  In other words, it was...

{"text":"Where do begin? The  only  shining service point of the night was putting our name in for a table. The service only went down from there. My fiancé waited 15 minutes at the bar trying to get order a round of drinks, nothing, 

Finally our table was ready - a 2-seater for three people.  We took it so we didn't have to wait any longer.... That was a mistake.

Our server Braydon was friendly but less than attentive. She  walked by our table numerous times, looked at us, but stopped for drink orders from the tables next to us. When she finally stopped - we only saw her a handful of times.  

Our drinks were decent - my friend's drink had an extremely heavy pour.  Our appetizers were good (the nuts!)  but a bit overpriced ($10) for a bowl full of nuts. The water was definitely not cold (or cool). 

Overall, it was a great atmosphere. I definitely enjoyed the bar's set-up. The people watching is fantastic. I'd try it again in hopes if a better service experience!"}
{"text":"This place gets one star, that star is ONLY based on the fact that it is a rooftop bar downtown.   Other than that single fact, this place blows.  Drinks are insanely expensive and the food was ridiculously expensive as well.  

The worst part about this place was we went on a rainy night and they had the roof covered. It was so hot and humid in there I was miserable! I mean really, is it too much to ask for a little AC or at the very less a fan? I'm paying $13 a drink over here, people!!! 

Go to the bar a couple doors down. It was a dive but they have drink specials every night of the week and cheap food. I can't recall the name but it is directly across from the Marriott courtyard, some sort of Irish pub/dive bar.  My husband and I shared a massive plate of cheese fries for 7$ and several 6$ martinis!"}
{"text":"My friends and I looove coming here. Whether for happy hour or after dinner drinks. We've done birthdays and other celebrations here as well and ALWAYS have a wonderful time. One time there was a totally creepy dude we caught trying to take pics of us and the security team (Dan, Christina, and Cody) took AMAZING care of us. They kept an eye on us all night and even walked us out at the end of the night to make sure we made it home okay. I love coming here and I love the staff. Favorite  bar in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but I can't say I've ever left hungry or unhappy. A simple, well-done spot that I could come to over and over."}
{"text":"I recently dined with friends at Il Tetto and had a really nice time.  My friends can be beer snobs but they had something for everyone.  The food was really good too.  Our server suggested some of her favorite items and they were on point."}
{"text":"Il Tetto- should be Ewl Tetto. Our first time to Pittsburgh and we stopped here after we left the Mexican place next door (which is so good btw) anyways. Service: well you better hope not to get Olivia  she was horrible. She could care less, was so rude, and at the end threw our check (literally threw) read my other reviews I am super honest. She threw it and said have a good day. Ugh, Olivia happy Friday to you. I get people have bad days but common. Now on to the drinks, HORRIBLE. Not sure worth the money."}
{"text":"Very awesome atmosphere. Only downfall is NO HAPPY HOUR. It is a bit pricey that is for sure. But you are paying for the atmosphere. Their cheapest beer is 5.50$ and ranges to 9$. I just wish they had a happy hour!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Every time I come it's always a great atmosphere.  I love the open-air concept.  The drinks are great, but slightly pricey.  The staff has always been friendly.  The music is always awesome on the weekends.  Loved the Christmas decorations too!  Overall, I have nothing but positive things to say!  This has become one of my \"go-to\" places to hang out on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at Il Tetto. It is a great spot to hang out after work and have a few beers with the co-workers. 

However, I'm giving il Tetto three stars because of the not so great prices/appetizers and awkward ID process.   A few of my co-workers held a happy hour at Il Tetto for me to celebrate my move to a different department. I was actually running late....I know late to my own happy hour....and as soon as the elevator door opened I hopped off, saw my co-workers waving me over, and proceed to hurry on over. Well, I totally forgot about their awkward ID process. You have to actually hand a \"bouncer\" your ID As soon as you get off the elevator. I forgot to do this since I was in a rush to get over to my co-workers. Well, i shouldn't have forgotten.... The \"bouncer\" rushes up behind me and touches me on the shoulder to get my attention. This was totally awkward and uncomfortable. I understand it is their process, but maybe he could have let me set my things down and been a bit more relaxed in how he asked for my ID. just a suggestion. 

Another thing I'm not too crazy about is the menu. They don't have the best beer selection for the prices. I paid almost $6 for one yuengling summer wheat beer. I drank imported German beer for $6 in a bar in NYC (this was a rare find, I know). But, still... $6 for a yuengling and it wasn't even a craft beer. Next, I do not care much for the food options/prices. One of the appetizers was $18!"}
{"text":"The concept of Il Tetto is awesome. Rooftop bar that is open air during warmer months. Great beer and beverage selections. Place can pack in a solid crowd. 
            Reality: drinks are pricey and service can be a little slow. The venue and the drink offerings are 5/5 but the service/ cost is about 3/5. Despite these negatives I still really like this place. I recommend coming here for a few drinks before or after dinner at one of the two restaurants below."}
{"text":"Really trendy rooftop bar downtown which makes it a great place for happy hour and for any other drinking occasion for that matter. Because of that, Il Tetto gets a huge crowd. If there isn't a line to take the elevator, there's a line to get a drink. I've never had the food here so I can't speak on that. The drinks are not too bad, but quite expensive. What I don't understand, though, is they have the exact same drinks as Emporio downstairs, yet they don't have the same happy hour specials.  They're banking on getting more interest upstairs so they can get away with charging more. Seems a little unfair since it's technically one business."}
{"text":"Had a get-together here. Loved the beer and the atmosphere. On the rooftop there is a clear roof that opens and closes above you, so if its rainy you can still chill out and drink. Very cool!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for drinks in the city! Awesome views, and a great drink selection. It is super nice in the summer, but it is open all year round! I think they have a limited appetizer menu, but I have only been there to drink. I will say the hours are limited and vary in the colder months, and I have found myself disappointed because it's closed."}
{"text":"Hearing about Il Tetto & seeing it for the first time gets you very excited. Then you talk to the people who work there. I have tried it three different times & every time the experience is the same. I have asked several other people their opinion & they agree with me. We went up there waiting for our table at Sienna Mercato & are always treated with disrespect & eye rolls. They act like their tables are gold plated reserved for royalty. It also takes ten years to get a drink at the bar. The tables are always dirty with other people's drinks. It's definitely not worth going there. Next time I will go down the street to Seviche until No Wait says my table is ready. If they don't cleanup their act they will close. The bad service baffles me because it is so great at Sienna Mercato & Sienna on the plaza. I heard mezzo is great too. Il Tetto, get your act together & Fire your surly hostesses."}
{"text":"Great idea - terrible execution. I came here per a coworker's suggestion earlier this month and found that while the space is lovely and the food tasty, the service was too horrendous to ignore.

One of the biggest drawbacks of Il Tetto is in the extended name - the rooftop garden. Don't get me wrong: if it's a beautiful day outside, this place strikes me as a great setting for a drink. Unfortunately we live in Pittsburgh and the common threat of rain meant that the garden went from open to covered during my visit. The noise level tripled and the temperature climbed when it did, making the place almost unbearable. 

I stuck it out because I was really enjoying my drink and the food with my company. Their Pimms Cup cocktail includes fruit flavoring and ginger beer, not the usual combination in this drink. Their chocolate hazelnut marjolaine dessert was amazing, and both the spinach and buffalo chicken dips were fantastic.

Unfortunately, getting the food in particular turned into quite the challenge. Our table's waitress more or less ignored me after I placed my first drink order. My coworkers and I had to shout after her at one point because she would walk off before we had a chance to ask her for food or drink refills. Not once did my water get refilled during my visit, by the way. Fortunately I had a Pepsi in my bag to help combat both the room's temperature and the heat in the buffalo chicken dip.

The final nail in the roof garden's coffin was when I asked for my check. I figured things were moving slowly so I would ask for it early. Boy was my prediction spot on. I waited at least 30 minutes for my check (I didn't start a countdown until after I had been waiting some amount of time, so I only know it was more than 30 minutes). I even watched people who asked for their checks after me get theirs before I did. Oh, and I only got my check because I told a passing server how long I had been waiting.

I expect that I'll check out the other parts of Sienna Mercato in the future, but the rooftop garden did not impress me. Yes, the food and drinks were great. The place is probably lovely enough to visit when the place is open (although I suspect it's covered more often than not). But after that horrendous service I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"We would have given this four stars, but we had a terrible customer service experience. 

We were seated right away on Friday night. The beer list was great, and we ordered two beers that were very tasty. A little too much time passed before our server asked about our food order. We asked about the cheese plate, and our server seemed only slightly knowledgeable. We ordered it anyway ($22), and also ordered the mushroom risotto and octopus. 

The mushroom risotto was excellent, and the octopus was very good. The cheese plate was also good, except there wasn't enough bread. This is where the bad customer service came in. 

We asked for more bread, the server told us it would be $5. We balked, and said \"we've ordered cheese all over the world and have never been charged for more bread. We want to talk to a manager.\" 

Our server went away for a while and came back and said, \"my mistake, it's $3\". We said, \"how about $1\", he said he would get a manager. 

Some woman came over, although she didn't identify her job title. We asked for more bread, gratis. She said, \"$3\". We suggested that she sell us the bread for the reasonable price of $1, or else she should suggest something else to make us satisfied. She had no suggestions. She said she would talk to the chef, and that she didn't have the right \"pull\". We said, \"we want to talk to someone with pull.\" At this point, our check was around $100. They really wanted that $3 more than for us to have a positive experience, I guess. 

After several minutes, \"Chris\" came by, who seemed to have the necessary 'pull' to get us our darn bread we needed to finish eating our $22 cheese. However, rather than try to make us satisfied customers, he acted defensive.

Note to restauranteurs: if folks on $100 checks want bread to enjoy their cheese, don't try to squeeze $3 out of them. A satisfied customer is worth much more than that. We will not be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Il Tetto on a Saturday afternoon. Luckily it was a gorgeous day so the rooftop was open. We were there early so while there was a crowd, it was nowhere near unbearable. We both LOVED our cocktails - one had tequila & beets, one had bourbon, balsamic and basil. Both amazing (and around $11 each), we stayed for another round. 

We sat at the bar and had good service, but didn't order food. The view from the balcony isn't anything to write home about but it was still a nice area to linger in for a bit. We also weren't huge fans of the roped off elevator line situation, but our wait wasn't long at all. Overall this was a great place to soak up some sun on a lovely day."}
{"text":"My first time experience at this place was just not that great. Huge line to one small elevator to get up to 3rd floor. When you get up to the rooftop, the view is nothing spectacular. You are looking at an apartment building and the walls of other buildings. I guess it's good if you just want to have the feeling of being outside. We looked around and saw reserved signs on lot of tables but there where some without the signs so we set down and waited for the waitress to show up. The place was busy but it definitely had lot of open tables. Our waitress told us that we are not aloud to seat ourself, so we had to go back to register to get a table. I was not happy about that, hence all the open tables nobody was using. We had to go get our drinks at the bar and wait around another 10 minutes and then we were seated back at a table. Just seems a little weird rule for a bar."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5, the drinks were great, awesome wines by the glass and of course a large beer selection.  However the appetizers were nothing to write home about.  The cheese platter was full of bland boring cheeses that were not worth the price . The pastrami was nearly all fat and dry.  The best thing tried was the duck confit fries and that was slightly above average. Very nice atmosphere, would go back JUST for drinks."}
{"text":"Went to this beer garden (my first one ever, if that's notable in any case) with some friends while waiting for a table for the meatball joint that is Sienna Mercato. Not going to lie, but I initially wasn't too thrilled at the idea of going here seeing some of the recent reviews. However, I didn't find it to be as bad as people were saying. For one thing, we went on a rainy day and they had the rooftop cover raised to help keep the attendees dry from the rain. However, I think they learned a lesson from those who complained on this platform earlier in the summer seeing as the roof was not completely enclosed this time around (thankfully), which allowed for the heat that comes from having so many people in an enclosed space at one time to escape into the rainy night outside. Service was prompt and at least from what I remember, I don't remember having any incidents with rude waitresses, people, etc.
As for drinks, they have a nice sized selection of beers, wines, cocktails, and drafts. I ended up sharing a hard cider with a friend and found it to be quite satisfactory. They also have a decent size menu for appetizers and small eats, but taking one look at the prices ... yeah a little hard to swallow. Overall, it's an okay venue to share a drink with friends ... a little on the loud side, but that's to be expected in a place with a lot of people."}
{"text":"A beautiful out door bar. You can see a lot of buildings from here.

The roof is open in the summer. They have tvs and a bar and bar food.

This is on the 3rd floor of Sienna Mercato."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot if you want open air &
Rooftop. I'm told one of the few or only rooftop spots in Pittsburgh. It was pretty crowded but had good timing w a table leaving. 

Can get table service but can be slower than going to the bar. I still opted for table service. There is food avail upstairs but I only saw a table eating a soft pretzel. Looked tasty from afar.

A few mix drinks; one being an Aperol Spritz. An Italian drink or a new Real Housewives of Beverly Hills fav depending on who you ask. (Feel free to judge my reality TV show watching & influence when trying drinks). The first & second tasted totally different and were served in different glasses. But why send it back?! 

A raindrop hit my arm & before I could say, \"hey is it...\" a quick downpour started. This resulted in half the bar rushing to the other half that had a roof. Quickly the retractable roof was shut & the evening was saved. The staff was nice in getting towels to wipe down tables and chairs."}
{"text":"I love this rooftop bar! We decided to go here after Billy Joel, and I am only writing the review since we got food. As far as drinks go this place is a great place to go anytime of the year! (It has a retractable roof!!!!) The view and atmosphere are absolutely amazing, the only other comparable thing would be Biergarten at the Hotel Monaco. 

The reason for the four stars is because even though the service and flatbread pizza we got were great the late night snack menu was seriously lacking. Being from out of town, maybe I overestimate Pittsburgher's appetite for a decent late night appetizer menu. I understand cutting costs by only offering flatbread pizzas, but having the choice of bruschetta or nachos or anything other than pizza would have been nice. That being said, the bacon and egg pizza with maple glaze we got was a solid decision and tasted like breakfast morning. 

I will keep coming here with friends and family, but maybe just for drinks next time!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a HUGE fan of this spot because of the feel of the venue and their food. Specifically their beef jerky. Friends of mine used to come from Morgantown to order so much beef jerky and now it's off the menu. I am so freakin sad about them removing this from them menu. I think we'll be considering other locations downtown to get drinks from now on"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a couple of drinks here with friends after dinner downstairs. The atmosphere was super nice and there's plenty of space, so it wasn't too crowded even for a weekend evening. Drinks were pretty good; we enjoyed a couple classics (moscow mule & mojito), and tried one of their watermelon cocktails which was okay, although too sugary for our liking. Service was also alright - although we were seated at the bar, it took quite some time to flag down a bartender, and even then, our drinks were forgotten several times. It was a busy night and the bar was definitely pretty lively, so we'll have to try again sometime when the crowd is more manageable."}
{"text":"The menu up here is weak. The table next to us had some great looking pizzas but we were told that was some special event. 

Great atmosphere and beer selection."}
{"text":"Fun place for drinks, but do not go if you are hungry.  Only appetizers are available.  Great beer selection and the roof top is fun.  If you are hungry, stay downstairs for the meatballs."}
{"text":"Great concept and great space, but poor execution ruins it for me.  I've been here at several times at different times throughout the year.  I've never not been annoyed by something or another.   

The good:  The space is pretty and I love the open roof/city views.  That's pretty much it.   

The rest of it:   Well, for starters, the service sucks.  All the time.  No one is friendly.  The hostess/seating process still baffles me even after a half dozen visits.  It's first come first served, except that all of the tables are always reserved.  If you try to sit anywhere except the bar, you are immediately rousted and told (generally not so politely) to move.  It's crazy crowded, especially when the weather is nice. Their occupancy limit is definitely at \"pack it in\" level.  There is usually a line to get up the elevator.  The bar is frequently three deep and always understaffed.   The drinks and the menu items are all overpriced - you are paying for the concept for sure.  And to boot, it's rarely a comfortable space.  The open air thing is great on the right day; but when that roof is closed, the temperature is way off.  And I notice that the sun is in my eyes a lot there.   

Overall, I just don't love it."}
{"text":"When I asked where this place was located, I was pleased to learn it was located right across from the Courtyard hotel on Penn Ave. Il Tetto is on the third floor, part of a three restaurant complex. 
There is a small elevator located on the first floor that you use to reach the roof top. Upstairs, you will find a open airy bar. At the time I went (December) the glass roof was closed, but still allowed natural light in.
The bar is long with plenty of seats. Also, they have a number of large tables that seat 8 or more. The have a diverse, varied craft beer menu. I went with the Alpine Double Hoppines, which was outstanding. 
Give this place a chance."}
{"text":"This place has two and a half stars?!?! What!!  My favorite spot downtown. Great staff. Great food. Great drinks. Yes, it gets busy and loud, but it's so fun. We love all three floors of this restaurant and visit more often than we should. I always take my out of town family and friends here!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service here is poor at best. I understand having to wait on busier nights, however when I have a seat at the bar and they're serving EVERY person around me and my party, it's unacceptable. The drinks are good at best, the draft list isn't anything to write home about. If the service were acceptable this would be a 3.5/5..."}
{"text":"We didn't get to eat here, or even grab a drink for that matter (hence the two stars), but we did get to experience the service... And I wanted to write about it because it was the ultimate disappointment.  Almost terrible enough to warrant one star, but I feel like since we didn't get to eat or drink, I would try to be fair.  Service is the one thing that will keep me coming back, even if the food or drinks are nothing to write home about. 

We decided to venture in here one day, and it was not insanely busy. A decent sizes crowd but nothing insane with waits or anything.  We were first rudely cut in front of immediately in front of the host stand.  Bad experience part one.  They saw what happened, and even though the person brought meatballs from downstairs which you aren't supposed to do from what I heard them telling her, they still seated the rude lady first.  Finally, someone takes us to a seat... Where we wait, and wait and wait and aren't even greeted by a server.  We waited long enough.  We had seen servers greeting ppl who were seated long after us, but somehow, our little area was being ignored. Being hungry, and annoyed, I decided it was not a place I wanted to spend my money and left.  

I won't be back to the rooftop there... Thankfully our experiences at Emporio have been better, so we will at least go there."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour on a weekday. Service is subpar (it took almost 20-30 minutes to get a server's attention), then they never checked back on us. I say 'they' because noone was actually assigned to us and they acted like they could care less. Good beer & draft selection, typical bar food/apps. If it wasn't for the really open atmosphere and roof top, I'd otherwise pass on Il Tetto and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I can see this rooftop beer garden being one of my frequent places once I make the move to the 'burgh (do yall say the 'burgh?).  Since it is the winter, the roof is enclosed but there is a balcony area if you want to brave the cold.  The balcony area has several lit up Christmas trees to add to the holiday spirit.  We sat at the bar and loved the decor and lighting.  The bartenders are very on top of their services here.

Beer:  Order the pineapple ale!  It's tasty but low on alc % - we can't have it all, I guess.
Bar snack:  Pork rinds - larger than life is all"}
{"text":"First time visiting Pittsburgh in love with the city . Decided to visit this bar in my birthday and the worst customer service. First i went to the rooftop and after 10 min order my drink they close down the bar at 10:45pm . Still i wanted to stay went downstair to finish my drink and order more with our friends. Few people at the bar nice music. Request drinks and the bartenders for drinks and said i would be there in a sec . Call her attention saying in a polite way and the reply was always I would be there in a sec. Still has been 2 hours and yet no one has come to serve us .
Hope that the two young ladies serving the bar learn to have good manners and have the best customer service."}
{"text":"The setting is very nice but the security staff are incredibly disrespectful and unpleasant. The service was slow and every dish was too salty."}
{"text":"I was here this summer. It was busy, it was warm, and it was fun. 

My suggestion is to make this an early stop to avoid the lines everyone is complaining about."}
{"text":"When you have friends or family visiting in town, and you want to show off Pittsburgh, Il Tetto is the perfect place to kick off the night. 

Just as a warning, it is sometimes difficult to get up to this space. The host desk will direct you to an incredibly slow elevator in the back of Emporio to get you up there. I repeat, the elevator is so slow, and if you're with a crowd, it's going to take a while to get up there. 

When the weather is right, this place is a gorgeous spot to see the city. From the deck, you get to see the city from a new angle, and it boasts a great view of the river.  

Early in the evening, the rooftop bar has a laid back vibe. There have been times I've gone later and it has been crazy up there, and impossible to get a table. The draft list is fun, but overpriced for even craft beer lovers.

I've been to Il Tetto several times, but only eaten there once. The food menu is small and overpriced compared to the first two floors of the Sienna Mercato establishment. We ordered several small plates including the meat & cheese, and house-made pork rinds. Neither were worth writing home about, and while I enjoyed the view and draft list, I don't think I'd eat there again. 

This place is perfect for a drink and a view before you head off to somewhere better to eat."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last week with my wife for a happy hour with some of her coworkers.  Upon entering the building on the first floor we saw that the steps were closed and knowing that the beer garden was on the third floor, we had to ask how to get upstairs.  The hostess directed us to the elevator which is in the exact opposite corner of the restaurant as the one that you enter from.  This seemed to be somewhat counter intuitive as I would think you would want people to be able to get to all of your spaces.  Once we finally made it upstairs you could tell that this was a pretty awesome place. There was a bar the length of the roof as well as a good number of tables.  The tables were not crowded in though and left plenty of room for standing around and hanging out.  The decor consisted of gas lamps with some stringed lights in-between and also what I think is a retractable glass roof that was open the night that we were there.  Their beer list was pretty decent and had about 20 different beers.  Most of these I think were seasonal since it was autumn and the list was dominated by pumpkin beers.  Our server ended up being pretty nice to us and I found service to be decent especially for the number of people that were there.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While I found the beers themselves to be somewhat overpriced, the vibe of the place was pretty awesome and is what would get me to come back again."}
{"text":"The view and overall atmosphere during the summer is definitely enjoyable and there aren't too many other happy hour spots that offer this (could be why most of the business casual population can be found here at night). 

Despite that, the service on the roof is abysmal. I truly don't believe that staffing is the issue. These people simply might not care at all. You stand and wait 15-20 minutes without being served as you flash your card right in front of their faces and try to get their attention. I would tip you a lot more if you'd actually pay attention. I paid $18 after settling for two green tea shots (I find it difficult to believe you're completely out of Red Bull when the other two levels under Sienna are dead).

I believe that the experience could be improved overall. Train your bartenders. It's to their own personal benefit to provide decent service."}
{"text":"I will not be going back to this awful place unless forced. Even then, I will probably have to be searched by one of their rude bouncers because I will, indeed, have a flask on me. Rooftops, i get why they are so popular. After spending all day inside, basking in the sun on beautiful day is a great way to revitalize yourself and upping your vitamin D. I would rather hang out in a basement with the lights off than go back to Il Tetto. I am sad about it, as I really enjoy Sienna on the Square and even Sienna Mercato downstairs. 

The appetizers at Il Tetto are sad, overpriced and not worth it. Marinated olives are $10 and not worth it. The beef tartare tastes like bacon and is a million dollars without even mentioning what kind of beef is used. 

The atmosphere also lacks anything worth while. The sun was shining the other day but the rooftop bar doesn't seem to let a lot of sun in with different sheets hanging across the rooftop. 
It was also far too crowded to be enjoyed. The atmosphere could have been appreciated a lot more if it wasn't so packed. I understand that restaurants want to make money and people equal money. But the key is to make people want to come back. My entire party of 10 will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such negative reviews. Came here on a Saturday evening and our service was prompt and the food came out fast. A little expensive when compared to the surrounding bars, but it's an outdoor roof deck and you can't really ask for much more. 

The crowd was mostly young professionals. I would recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy a drink outdoors"}
{"text":"Great beer selection with late night draft specials during the week.  They don't offer much for food outside of little plates, but the bruschetta was on point.  When it's warm out, the roof opens up and you can see a really pretty view of the skyline.  Parking can sometimes be tricky, but there's a garage and a lot a few blocks down.  I'll definitely be back when the weather warms up."}
{"text":"A totally unique and open 3rd floor space feels fun and cool. This location made a perfect birthday surprise spot for my amazing fiancé. Not only because of this great third floor bar, but because of the wonderful Italian restaurant on the second floor (just take the elevator back down to entry floor and walk up the stairs to 2). Loved the appetizers and the craft beers on tap, hard cider options and wine - everyone can order their favorite drink here. 
I cannot wait to visit again especially in the summer when the roof is open. Even in early Oct with the roof closed, this unique space made for a perfect start to a special bday celebration. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous setting under the open sky and string lights.  Love the fact that the roof is retractable so the bar can be enjoyed even in inclement weather.  

As expected, it gets very busy.  You have to wait in a line downstairs until people leave.  Then you take the elevator up and deal with more crowds.  Despite the number of people, the bartenders were very quick and pleasant.  Drinks were incredible but pricey.  We had to leave just because we didn't want to keep dropping $10 for each drink.

Another negative is how hot it was.  There was absolutely no circulating air.  No relief whatsoever.  It appeared as though there were AC units behind the bar but we couldn't feel anything.  Even some industrial fans would have helped."}
{"text":"If it's summer time you must try Il Tetto at least once. It is a little pricey which is my only complaint but I just love it here. On a nice summer night it is just stunning with the lights and looking at the buildings in the city. 

One of my newest discoveries about this place is the Tiki Nights every Sunday starting in the Spring. They offer island themed drinks and food. All of the drinks come in super cute glasses. And if it gets too pricey you can always just head down to Emporio and enjoy some meatballs!"}
{"text":"I was hoping that this would be a nice place to have a few drinks and enjoy the outside evening air. Unfortunately, the beer options are limited. I was expecting a lot of craft beer options. There was Miller lite, dos equis, and other mass produced beers.
It was very noisy with the roof closed and it was hot. They are trying to cool the area with multiple split systems. I didn't think it was effective and I was there at 9 at night.
Lastly the service was slow. We ordered a first round. Once it finally arrived,we never saw the waitress again until I flagged her  down for the check.
The good news is there are a lot of  options in this area."}
{"text":"I stopped in on Saturday for their Rosé event which had been heavily advertised on Facebook. I'd never been to Il Tetto before, and I have to say, based on this experience I doubt I'll be back anytime soon. Maybe I'll give it a year or two. It really left a bad taste.

First and foremost, I understand the challenges of the space. To get to Ill Tetto, you have to take an elevator. Before which there is a very long line to wait in. Thankfully, they had a server there to take charge you out the wazoo by 'offering' you an alcoholic beverage.

When you do finally get up to the rooftop, there's a huge wall of people. As far as your eye can see, people everywhere. The bar is 2-3ppl deep. All the tables are taken. There are groups of people hanging around a table that had raffle baskets on it.

So everyone rushes out of the elevator and go in search of more beverages, and maybe a place to sit. It's important to mention here that usually Il Tetto is open seating, first come first served. I know this by looking at past reviews all over the internet. Thus when the crowd from my elevator rushes out to find seats, I follow suit.

Well eventually I find a table, and join 3 other ladies already sitting there. Thankfully they agreed to let me join them. I was planning on being in for one and done, but judging by this crowd, it was going to take an extremely long time to get anything delivered to the table.

A server approached and took my drink order (a frozé rosé or something similar sounding; basically a frozen rosé wine cocktail) along with a debit card to close me out. Right after that is when a manager (assumed based on the suit and earpiece) who asked all of us if anyone had sat us there. The girls said no, and he proceeded to tell us that we couldn't sit there without being sat by the hostess. We also overheard his talking to our server who exclaimed 'that's on you' (I'm assuming about the table controversy)

Well that's terrific. Because none of us had seen one; much less a hostess stand or a sign directing us to wait, or heck, even a reserved sign for the table. The manager proceeded to kick us off the table, and only started to apologize when I exclaimed that this was the worst run event I've seen in a a long long time. He called me 'honey' a couple of times and I was quick to correct him and make sure that didn't happen again.

He apologized for the confusion, and promised a couple of things. Firstly, that he would find us a table ASAP. Secondly, that he'd comp our round of drinks. Then it changed to send out some appetizers. And finally that he'd send out a round of shots.

Eventually we got moved to a table; but not before being forced to wait against a wall, while my dining companions desserts came out and they had no where to eat them, and while this group of girls who were standing near us sat at the table and proceeded to clink their glasses and boast how they eventually got a table and were ecstatic they had to kick someone else off of one to get it.

When we did get to a table, there was further confusion on which server we would have. Let me repeat that. It was apparent that for a space filled with at
LEAST 100-150 people that at the tables, there were 2-3 servers max. That's insanely vastly understaffed. We did also see a hostess, eventually. She stood behind the table that held the gift baskets, which was apparently a host stand. Still, there was no communication with anyone coming off the ekevators during the time we were there and more mad dashes for tables. Finally, there were 2 bartenders for a bar that spanned the length of the rooftop, and was 3 people deep at times down the entire length. Also incredibly understaffed.

The manager did make good on a few of the many promises. He comped our first round of drinks. Or rather my first, and my dining companions second round. He also brought out a round of fireball shots. In the meantime, it took about 45 minutes to be told they were out of the frozen rosé drink; and I'd need to order something else. I did so; which then took about another 15 minutes to obtain it.

All said and done, it was getting late. I had already been there for two hours and had only been served one drink during that time frame. That's just ridiculous and uncalled for.

So why 3 stars? I feel like an effort to recover was made, and that deserves at least a decent well thought out review and stars that are contemplated. The manager did everything he could do make us happy, and that's sincerely appreciated. He did forget about the appetizers, but again, they were so short staffed, I'm not surprised.


So will I return? Maybe. If a friend wants to go, I'll be suggesting someplace else. If I'm left with no choice, I guess I'll resign myself and dip out early. That's the only way I'll be able to stand it if usual service is like the above."}
{"text":"I have never had such a bad experience. I have lived in major metro areas all over the country, and have never experienced such terrible service. We came to celebrate a birthday and had a group of about 12. Now, I've dined in many an eatery with large groups, and I have NEVER been advised that the wait would be over 2 hours at Sienna Mercato. BUT, it was a birthday celebration. 

Well, how can I say this gently? Aside from being grossly overpriced ($10 for some roasted seasoned nuts, anyone? Perhaps $22 for a cheese tray?), the appetizers were not good to say the least and we were flat out profiled. Sit tight. This is long...

We arrived at the restaurant around 6:15pm. We were told that wait would be long, but we could always pass some time upstairs at the Beer Garden. Fine. So we head up to the 3rd floor and stand around aimlessly for about 15-20 minutes until someone finally acknowledged the presence of a pretty sizable group. The server began to take drink orders, including water with lemon for the table. We were told that we could not have water, as they had no glasses. Ok. We will wait a few minutes for water. After waiting about 20 minutes for our water, they brought out glasses halfway full of room temperature water. Now, that's not such a big deal, but it was just the first of a string of issues with this place. We began placing drink orders and appetizers, and our server was nice enough. When the apps began to come out, it spiraled quickly downhill from here. We sent back an order of bruschetta (who throws raw tomatoes and cold cheese on soggy wonder bread and calls it an appetizer??), as well as some other pork/cat food/raw egg situation... So we ordered wings instead. The wings were tasty, which was the only saving grace. At one point, one of the wait staff came over and asked if we had ordered another bruschetta, and we laughed and said \"Not over here. We just sent one back\". He looked at me, rolled his eyes and snapped his neck and said \"did you order this or not?\" With a heck of an attitude. I stared blankly at him. Really, sir?? Ok. So I requested a manager. Mind you, we had been upstairs for about an hour waiting for our table by this time. When the manager finally came over (after 3 requests) the manager came over and seemed less than interested in helping, accommodating, or addressing the issues. She pretty much rolled her eyes at everything that was said to her with regard to the less than stellar experience we had had up to that point (piss poor customer service, anyone?). 

We finally began inquiring about the state of our table downstairs, fed up with the foolishness upstairs. She cashed out our tabs saying that there shouldn't be much more of a wait. It was 8:03pm, as per the stamp on my receipt. The young lady called down and returned at 9:15pm (she never returned during that hour to check and see if we needed anything else. Another drink. Water. Nothing.) to inform us that it would be at least another hour. 3.5 hours for a table?? In Pittsburgh?? HOW? No one had a good answer. We then requested another manager. The one that showed up claimed to be the GM, and simply added to the attitude filled eye rolling party started by the initial, dark haired manager. She told us that we could either wait for at least another 45, or we could leave. No attempts to accommodate our group at all. They were BOTH extremely dismissive and very, VERY rude. We began explaining to them how disappointed we were at the treatment we had received. We expressed how we simply wanted to sit down and enjoy dinner. We expressed that it was simply UNHEARD OF to have to wait for 3.5 hours for a table for dinner. Neither cared. 

So, as we continued having conversation with the two managers about the awful experience, the manager that told us that we could either wait or leave was apparently tired of hearing what we had to say. She signaled to the dark haired manager, AND THIS WOMAN LEANED OVER INTO HER MIC AND REQUESTED SECURITY! SECURITY?? For what? Because we were dissatisfied with our service?? Because they were tired of hearing the criticism from a group of people that had been waiting WELL OVER 3 HOURS TO BE SEATED? Security walks over and we all are just stunned at what was happening. There was NO vulgarity. No threats of violence (who does that over a table for dinner? It's NEVER that serious). There was no yelling, cursing, disrespect, or anything of the sort. Just a group of people being treated TERRIBLY by what should be a customer service based organization. 

The sub par, overpriced food, the ignorant and disrespectful wait and management staff, and the lack of general concern or desire to accommodate a group of young professionals, and the blatant racial profiling that took place will cause me to NEVER set foot in this establishment again. EVER. I am highly disappointed and will be contacting the corporate entity to be sure that this is addressed. 

Never again"}
{"text":"Il Tetto has more to offer in terms of ambiance than food/drink. I was visiting from out of town for a work trip, so I was looking to try some local craft beers. Only a few on their list were local, and the draft prices were a little high. The bar snacks for also expensive for the quality. $10 for a plate of deviled eggs (5 or 6 halves) and another $10 or $11 for bruschetta (2 slices of toast). I was really excited to try the hummus, but it was super bland.  I wish you could order food downstairs from the pizza place and bring it up!"}
{"text":"My co-worker had been singing it's praises for a while and I had been looking forward to finally checking out the rooftop bar! 

Should've known not to come on a Saturday night on a clear evening.... my bad.

A little known fun fact: you have to take an elevator to the third floor. Oh, and guess what? On a clear, Saturday night, you can bet money there is a long long line to get on said elevator to finally enter the rooftop bar. 

I had such high hopes and expectations once I finally got on that elevator. But then felt quickly let down at the sight of people crammed like sardines on a roof that barely has standing room. If you are a young, strapping, single person his would be ideal since you are constantly bumping and rubbing up on each other whether you like it or not. But those days are long gone for me... 

The drinks were ok but we're a bit pricey. It's a premium you pay to be on a third story rooftop. 

I finally got to experience this place but will most likely not return. 

Two stars for the \"rooftop\" idea for Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I come here for 1 reason and that's for the roof top. I mean everyone loves a roof top bar and I'm sure that's why this place is usually busy. I've been a bunch of times and I just don't love it. Drinks are ok, appetizers are ok, and service is ok. To me it's just an ok place, but I'm sure I'll be back because it's one of the few rooftops in Pittsburgh. It's best to come here for a few drinks on a warm night then get dinner at one of the restaurants below."}
{"text":"One of the best bars in Pittsburgh! It's my favorite place to go in summer. The crowd is great and it's really good for office happy hours. It's one of the rare pubs in Pittsburgh that people dress up a little :)"}
{"text":"Who needs oversized \"security guards\" harassing people at an upscale establishment?  This place has a really strange vibe!!!  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"If it were not for this being a rooftop bar and good for a bigger group of people I am not sure I would go very often. The space is great and I love being on the rooftop for the warmer months. But I am not overly impressed by their drinks. This is a happy hour spot, the space calls for it, because of that you would think that there would be more specials, or more signature drinks but that really is not the case. If you want a beer they have it, or a gin and tonic . . . it is not a problem. However, it does run on the pricey side and I always feel like the bar is a bit understaffed.  That being said, I will always be back on those warmer nights because of the rooftop. . . so that is a good call and compensates for the overall average bar experience that it would be without the space."}
{"text":"The lines on a weekend are a pain, but in the end, on a beautiful summer night, you arrive on a gorgeous rooftop. Being on a rooftop on a nice night feels like the world is open and full of possibilities; I love it.

Strung lights, nice wooden tables, trendy atmosphere. Fancy drinks that are pricey but delicious and I guess you pay for the ambiance also.

I'm so excited for good weather to come (consistently) so that we can celebrate rooftops again! :D"}
{"text":"A wonderful place to catch up with friends on a Friday after a long week. Since it was a nice evening, the rooftop was open. The location is great with a beautiful view of the city and string lights. The drinks are a little pricy but worth it. A great place to take friends that are new to the city!"}
{"text":"Left the Pirates game early to walk to this place to get rooftop bar seating. On here, their hours say they close at midnight. Walked 15 minutes only to be told that tonight they are closing the second we walked in the door, before 11 pm. Really? People who want to go out after the game and Yelp a rooftop bar and this place shows up, only for them to close before the game is out on a Monday night and refuse customers. Nice."}
{"text":"Great outdoor spot. Beer selection is OK, not the Yard House by any stretch of the imagination, and pricey. Mediocre drafts command a princely sum compared to other places. However when all is said it is very fun to hang out here. Bar staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Great bar.  Horrible treatment by one of the bartenders.  Rude and disrespectful.  I hope that the owner reads this."}
{"text":"Gorgeous in the summer, and even better if you can get a seat (or a standing spot with a view!). They have fun, good drinks that are pretty much average in terms of price, at least for downtown. Their Caipirinha is especially good. It can get pretty crowded by the bar but even so, service is pretty fast! When you close your tab they are really quick about getting your card back to you, which is nice."}
{"text":"In keeping with transparency, here is the majority of an email I sent directly the the Manager of Il Tetto. As I mention in my email, I believe this issue to be fundamental and consistent and doesn't appear to be getting better. 

After some deliberation, I've decided that I must write to you regarding my - and my group's - awful experience on Thursday night. If this were the first time I'd had a negative experience at your business, you wouldn't hear from me. However, I believe this to be a fundamental and recurring flaw, one that has occurred just about every time that I've visited Il Tetto. Simply put, the combative and disrespectful nature of your staff is a travesty. As a small business owner, as well as a full time bartender, it's also an embarrassment. Only on the most rare occasions have I been treated in such a confrontational and dismissive manner. As I mentioned, Thursday night was one of these occasions. I'd be happy top share details with you, if you care, but I'll leave it as your Door/Elevator Operator/Security Staff need serious training when it comes to customer service and interaction. This was not the first time and I've come to the conclusion it will not be the last. My friends and I WILL NOT be coming back. There are too many other fine establishments in the neighborhood that appreciate our business and show RESPECT to their customers. I understand the nature of these people's jobs: Dealing with people who have been drinking, generally in high volumes, etc. But the idea that being combative and disrespectful right from the start of an interaction will only ever end with an extremely negative experience. I've had enough. My friends have had enough. And from what I'm seeing on social media - and just in the several issues I've had at your place of business - this is not uncommon."}
{"text":"Hmmm. Well, the space and rooftop are both beautiful, but I could do without the pretentiousness. Having people wait, albeit not too long, simply for waiting's sake is for other cities, not the 'burgh. And I didn't appreciate having to ask a server if I could order drinks from her as she refused to make eye contact. Just odd. 

Good draft list! I'll try it again, I think arriving early or late is the key."}
