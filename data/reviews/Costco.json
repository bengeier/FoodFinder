{"text":"I'm a huge Costco fan. The workers here are so helpful and they somehow manage to keep the lines moving quickly. I've never had to wait very long. You can't beat their food court either....best chocolate almond dipped ice cream bar ever!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! If Costco doesn't have what I need, I guess I don't need it that badly. Love it."}
{"text":"I have spent hundreds of dollars at costco when my mom and I go. She always shows her card and we have never had a problem with the Costco on 44th street and Thomas. I went to pick up a graduation present at the costco near Paradise Valley Mall and was spending another 130.00. At time of purchase we were asked for the membership card which was shown and I went to pay for the item and we were refused tender. I was told that I could not purchase the item my mother had to... OR I could go get cash and hand it to my mom who in turn could hand it to the employee. Really funny because it's the same dang thing. I will no longer be a spending a dime in a store who sells to people on welfare which is covered from my hard work and taken out of my taxes when they refuse refuse service to the person who's entire family are members. Bye bye costco... I may only be one fish in the sea of your members but guaranteed if I experienced this poor service someone else will as well."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get gas. Cheaper than anything else around here, and the attendant is the nicest guy. I left my Costco card at home once but he helped me out with his company card. Since then we chit chat all the time about his psychology degree etc The warehouse is always busy, but that's Costco for you. Love the free samples."}
{"text":"Pretty nice Costco, the pizza is awesome! The store is clean. If you can get there DURING normal Monday-Friday work hours, it's not so bad. But, if you shop there on weekends or after work hours it's a madhouse! The parking lot is small for a Costco, it's next to a mall so there high traffic all around. 5 stars of it weren't for the anxiety causing, shoulder to shoulder claustrophobia :p"}
{"text":"Bought a pair of RX sunglasses @ this location. Great customer service, and more than reasonable prices compared to regular glasses shops. Quick turnaround, too."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new store.  I was glad to see it because its a lot closer to my home.  I've been using the one on Hayden or the one on Cave Creek, which is a traffic nightmare.

Pretty much your standard COSTCO.  Easy to reach location just outside PV Mall.  There is no mall entrance, even though it looks to be attached.

Parking is a little less than other stores because of the mall.  Not as much room, and lots of cars jockeying for space.  You can park in the mall deck and stay out of the congestion right around the store.  That's a plus.

Stock is comparable to the other locations, probably a little less selection than the store on Hayden.  The produce section is definitely smaller.  

The staff is courteous and professional, which is the same at most locations.

Reading the other reviews I noticed one complaint about credit cards.  Really?  If you've been a member for any length of time, you know they don't take credit cards other than AMEX.   They HAVE started taking debit cards, so yay for that."}
{"text":"WOW! no full parking lot, lots of spaces available (like, since when?!), no line up going in, and guess what (no way!) only 1 cart in front of us at check-out!  (bonus).  All the shelves fully & neatly stocked.  Gas was about 20 cents less than all other contenders. 

So glad the mayhem at other costco @ Raintree is a thing of the past - ugh!  This visit was actually pleasant.  

(footnote: where the heck was the samples??)"}
{"text":"I love Costco but the cart return here blows! Yes I am one of those people who always puts my cart back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about Costco!!  They bring so many wonderful items into the community and the company is top notch! I feel I can always count on them and trust them. 5 STARS!!!"}
{"text":"Best costco location!!!   Dwight and Bill are the best, always make your day!!! Always try to go to this location!! :-)"}
{"text":"Unprofessional pharmacist. A few ladies in line were chummy with one of the pharmacists and had a nice long conversation. They turned in their form at least 10 minutes after I did and yet still got their flu vaccination before me.
I was waiting for 25 minutes and still haven't gotten my shot. 
If you don't mind waiting about 45 minutes for a simple flu shot, this place will do."}
{"text":"Ummm, it's Costco...

They're a chain of warehouse shops where people buy large quantities of stuff that seems like a great idea but they usually end up throwing half of it away because it expires before they can possibly consume it all. 

That being said, I love these guys!

Don't forget to get gas here, always the cheapest in town."}
{"text":"Clean. Staff is polite and friendly. Good prices. Never have any problems here, food is always fresh. They go above and beyond a regular grocery store."}
{"text":"I come here all the time! The gas prices are always less than the other competitors nearby. Plus if you go in the early morning during the week you won't have to wait to pump.

Now the store has a great selection of items, just like all other Costco's. The staff is always very friendly and helpful if I'm looking for a particular item. I get all of our household cleaning products here, since they are super affordable and they come in their jumbo packs so it lasts longer. It's usually busy on the weekends and occasionally during the lunch time rush, but the lines move fairly quickly."}
{"text":"I know... the first step is to admit that I have a problem.  My name is Brittany.  (Hi, Brittany!)  I am a carrots & apples addict.

Seriously, I eat a LOT of apples and carrots.  So, I get them at Costco, naturally.

I admit that I get gas and bulky items -- especially paper products and cleaning supplies -- at this location, but I particularly look for carrots and apples almost each time that I go.

The staff here are very nice, and most of the shoppers watch where they push their carts, despite a few times that distracted people have rammed me or my cart.

Avoid going to any Costco near any major holidays and on weekends, and you should be fine."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Costco?  I guess other than going for 1 item and leaving with $500 worth of stuff... :)"}
{"text":"\"James\" in Scottsdale Pharmacy came out from behind the counter to help me find an item today.  He checked every aisle and possible site for this product.  I've never seen such \"care\", wow he is a true example of exceeding expectations!  Thank you James!
Joe"}
{"text":"I usually have no problems shopping here, however, that changed recently ...

I was buying some resale products for my job, I told the cashier that it's for resale at least 3 times and she said okay, I even told her what type of resale it is for and she said okay.  And during the check-out through the midpoint, she remembered that it's for resale and she mumbled to herself that she didn't hear me telling her it's for resale.  I said I told you at least 3 times to her and her helper.  She kept talking to other people and not care what I told her so basically she didn't pay attention while she works.  I'll avoid her next time I check-out."}
{"text":"This review is for the pharmacy only. Idk if it's because I dropped off a controlled substance drug prescription or what but it was ridiculous that I had to wait over an hour when they told me it would be about an hour wait. I'll get my prescriptions filled elsewhere, Walgreen's gave me a wait of 25 min last time."}
{"text":"This Costco in particular is large and the floor schematic reminds me of that of the Costco locations in San Diego. The perishable departments are logically lumped together instead of sprawled apart, so you can visit dairy and then hop next door to produce. 

Like all Costcos, you can expect large quantities and discounted prices. But, it's no secret that you'll be walking out of there with a bill close or in the triple digit dollars. Bring a shopping list and stick to it!"}
{"text":"New costco is so nice and clean. They have free samples everyday and I love them for that. Much nicer than the ones on oak and bethany home. The best part is that I don't feel like I'm going to get shot when shopping here ."}
{"text":"The only thing that keeps me from shopping at this Costco more often than at other locations is the distance from where I live. But during those times that I find myself in this area, this is a shopping destination I look forward to. As with the other Costco stores of the region, it is huge, with a large inventory of affordable merchandise and always many new items, especially seasonal ones. But this is one of the less crowded Costco stores in the region, both inside and in terms of parking outside, and that makes shopping here even more pleasurable."}
{"text":"Not sure if I was trying to buy a membership or a new car. Evidently the guy at the Membership Desk is working off commission, because he didn't like it that I wouldn't sign up for the credit card, and pushed way too hard for me to buy more than a basic membership, so I left. You know what? Fry's & Safeway work just fine for me!"}
{"text":"For some reason, I try to avoid this Costco at all cost.  For me, it doesn't have the same vibe.  I feel people at this store are not as nice.  I was parked with the twins in the car while my hubby went in to check if they had a book we had bought at the other Costco.   Suddenly this guy and his wife who were parked next to me came back with their loot.  Once he unloaded his stuff, he decided that the best place to leave his empty car was against my door.  I couldn't lower the window since I had turned the car off, so I barely opened the door and said \"WTF\", I never expected to hear what came next.  My twins need speech therapy because they don't speak clearly, but yesterday well, my little girl said it very clearly... WTF perfect!  At least the guy took his cart an put it at a different spot.   Darn doesn't seem to have the same effect.   I guess I'll need to learn to love \"Darn\", darn."}
{"text":"I love this Costco and the treasure hunt that awaits you with each shopping trip. I never know what items I will find that I didn't know I couldn't live without. The store is bright and clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Time it right and you can get enough free samples to fill you up, but if not on your way out grab a hot dog and a soda or a chicken bake. While shopping you can even order a pizza to pick up on your way out the door to take home. It's huge and pretty tasty for the price. The reason they get 5 stars is because the food concession now takes debit cards. In the past you had to hope you had some cash on you.

Large cakes are a screaming deal so we are always get our birthday cakes here. They are cheap and yummy. A combination that can't be beat!"}
{"text":"This is a nice Costco, that doesn't seem to be as busy as the North Hayden location.

The Costco model is simple enough to understand.  Whatever they pay, you pay that price, plus 14%.  How's simple is that?  If you choose to be an Executive Member ($110), over the $55 a year Gold Star (individual), you receive another 2% as a rebate at the end of the year.  We have been members of both over the last twenty years, depending if we are going to make a large purchase.  BTW, you can switch to Executive at any time.  Just pay the extra $55.00 at Customer Service.

Granted both Costco and Sam's Club (Walmart) are competing for the same customers.  My experience has been that you are usually a fan and dedicate to your Wholesale Club over another.  Though members of BJs back east are the most fanatical.  I have found, that you will also believe to your last breath, as Yelp'er Andre E says, that your Club has: \" Great Deals....clean aisles.....Great Service....reliable products....Great customer Service.\"  It's almost takes on an religious article of faith!

All of Costco's Kirkland brand products are execellant.  I have found their Wine section to be unparalleled.   In the past Costco has sued various States to get the lowest price for it's Members. 

BTW, I try coming only during off hours. This helps to minimize the nonsense that Yelp'er Marisa S wrote about that goes on in the parking lot.  Sadly, civility tends to go out the window when you are looking for a parking space.  Just watch any Seinfield episode. LOL

Currently, Tuesdays @ 10:30 or 11 am seem to be the best time.  I just take an early lunch.

Enjoy, and drive carefully!"}
{"text":"Costco is the best place for anything and everything. This one is decently located. It also has friendly staff. It's not too busy most of the time. I like their produce. Great deals!"}
{"text":"I love Costco. I love THIS Costco. It is really busy all the time. 

The selection is great.  Just watch out those Sell By dates in the meat department."}
{"text":"Costco is selling discount tickets to dolphinaris. This is appalling that Costco would be involved in a business that promotes slavery.  Dolphins do not belong in a tank for our enjoyment    Shame on you."}
{"text":"Man!! After today, I have to say that as much as I dislike Discount Tire and their crappy \"service\" I'll sadly be going back to them.

I bought a set of tires at Costco thinking I was getting a good deal. Well, not only were they pretty much the same price as Discount Tire, their service at this Costco is nothin short of horrible. I've had 3 flats within 6 months of getting these tires, and the comment from Ken the manager\" was \"well, that's your fault, not the tires\". Even after I told him that I never had a flat with my old tires and they recommended moving from Yokohama to Michelin, and that I still drive the same route, he was about as rude and non-service oriented as you can be. Maybe \"Ken the manager\" shouldn't be in a customer service position if he hates the customers? Just my 2 cents but watching him be this way with all the customers, I don't think it's the customer."}
{"text":"Best Costco store in town! The store is clean and the layout is great. Staff are friendly and helpful. I do not go to any other Costcos except this one."}
{"text":"This is one of the best costco's in town. 

they have all of the usual favorites plus some special items.

High end liqor and wine, some $500+ bottles  Thirsty?

Kosher section with cheese, deli meat and some heat and eat items.

Larger Gift card section.

And some times a hidden gem in the tool aisle

My one gripe about this location is the food court, they opted to use Kirkland hot dogs over Hebrew national.

This costco is part of the PV mall but you can not enter from inside the mall."}
{"text":"The customer service is horrendous. The line to return an item is worse than registering an out of state plate with the DMV.

I bought an insteon home automation system which was a mistake now 30 minutes later the line has not moved. 

Maybe I will finally consider Sam's Club."}
{"text":"Why, yes, I would love to try a sample!

So despite taking out a quarter of Paradise Valley Mall, I still love Costco. I always find more than I need, but I'm set for like six months when I come out of this store. My only grudge is the parking. It can get a little crazy with people wanting the closest spot to the door and nearly run someone over to beat another car that eyed the same spot or they stalk you while you walk to your car. Anyhoo, food is yummy, always plenty of samples to try, and I've always encountered friendly employees."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times while in the area. Although, it's not my home store. Assistant Manager Rod and Cell phone Rep: Mike provide excellent service and have pride working here along with all of the Costco staff members I have had the pleasure of meeting and speaking to. :)"}
{"text":"Never shopping here again. We ordered a large combo and two slices of pepperoni. They had the pizzas ready but instead sold our slices to other individuals. We waited 30 mins then just told them were cancelling the order. They were extremely incompetent or racist. I will be canceling my membership here."}
{"text":"Ooops, I've been kind of sick and we didn't feel like cooking, we also had to go pick up a prescription at Costco so we stopped by the food court. : )

Oh man, we had dinner for 2 for about $7

Hubby had the new pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and I had the Polish. He thought it didn't have enough BBQ sauce, but it was still very good. I tasted the coleslaw and I liked it. So affordable, drinks are only $0.59 
We have a great respect for this company and their business model.

Way to go Costco!"}
{"text":"Costco gets 5 stars in book.....and really it goes without saying why....but here goes. Great Deals....clean aisles.....Great Service....reliable products....Great customer Service....and most importantly they honor all the policies that they promise you especially when you buy big ticket items. Now with all that being said here is where Costco really excels....currently the gas prices here in Arizona are staggering....if you don't have a Costco membership people....you need to RUN....not WALK to a warehouse right now and get some membership. Gas prices at costco are running a full 12-15 cent cheaper then most other gas stations anywhere in the valley with the exception of maybe mesa and chandler. I know everyone needs to save money right now....so if you truly do then become a Costco member ASAP....you won't regret it trust me. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a Costco member since 1987 so I am biased but they can't be beat for value, quality and experience.  When I travel I will often visit other Costco's just to see what they do different than mine back home. This location is my home store I like the layout  and this is the only place I buy my gas. If you don't like lines go during the week Mon-Wed during the day. Doesn't matter what you buy here is there is a problem with it you can exchange or return it, so you can buy without fear of wasting your money. You can't go wrong with Costco whether it's for a gift, groceries, prescriptions, clothes or fuel make this your go to spot."}
{"text":"The take-and-bake margherita pizza is back! Thank god! 

So. damn. good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Costco location. I'm in here so often I think the employees recognize me as a regular. Lol. I know the layout of the store, the employees here are professional and friendly. They often joke with me as I check out. It's not as crowded as the Hayden location and just FYI, gas here is always cheaper than the Hayden location too- significantly lower. A little secret that I'm sharing with you!"}
{"text":"Extremely lousy service in the tire department today. Dropped my car off for a scheduled appointment and gave them my phone number (when asked) for contact. Said it would be 60 minutes. Sat for 30 minutes and read. Shopped for 30 minutes. After Another 30 minutes I went to the  desk but no one was there. After an hour & 45 minutes, I corraled someone to go back and grab a service person. Turns out the car was finished 45 minutes earlier but no one ever called me. Or apologized for not reaching out. I guess they want  customers to waste their time by checking on the status of their car every 5-10 minutes. Give them what they deserve."}
{"text":"Costco is amazing. I must look a little strange to other people when I come to Costco because 80% of the time I walk out with 2, maybe 3 items. I don't necessarily need to make the trip sometimes, but I'm pretty much just looking for a reason to go.

One problem I have with Costco is more of a personal problem than a problem with Costco. I love their pizza and frozen yogurt too much. It's too good and every time I walk into Costco I am always battling myself about whether or not I should walk out with a goodie. This point was not factored into my rating of Costco.

Alright, so the first REAL problem I have with Costco is that buying fruit from them is always risky. There is absolutely no consistency with the quality of products they get in and you have to be really diligent about checking what you're grabbing. I must look like a loon when I spin my grapes around so that I can check and make sure there is absolutely no mold. I have a process down that reduces the risk, but I have had their fruit turn on  me a day after I bought it. Actually, I've seen them stock fruit that's already expired or that already have mold on it. Bad form Costco, bad form.

Another problem I have is the parking lot at this particular location. I always tell someone that I'm going to Costco and that if they don't hear from me within 3 hours then they should start calling the hospitals. This parking lot is a death trap. There are many blind curves that people come whipping around and there are practically no speed bumps so people are driving closer to 25-30 mph rather than 10-15mph. I've actually had to jump out of the way of a speeding car before. Thank god I was carrying my customary 2 items and didn't have a cart."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Costco all the employees are so nice and helpful Bill at the front always remembers me and asked me how my day is. As I watch him talk to other guests he remembers everyone's name he's amazing! Seriously the best employees I love this place!!"}
{"text":"we come to this location often since its close to us. we try to go when its not so busy since we have 2 little ones. love the bulk items, flowers if we have an event and we love getting hot dogs, pizza and ice cream for the drive back home."}
{"text":"Problem with the Tire Center.  When you buy Costco tires you are supposed to get free rotation and maintence for the life of the tires.  Brought mine in for rotation and the work order said they would check the nitrogen levels, rebalance the tires, and rotate them  After 20 minutes or so the called and said they couldn't rotate them because of \"edge\" wear. Went to pick up the vehicle and they had done NOTHING. \"No work performed.\" Just gave me a cost for buying new tires. HA! My next set will be purchased at Discount Tire..."}
{"text":"love me some costco! it is probably my favorite store in phoenix ... mainly because you never know what super fantastic special purchase you might find. this new one has a great stock of merchandise. one must be cognizant of prices however. i have found that some items, like soda and beer, are actually cheaper at the regular grocery if you catch the right sale. over the counter medications can be the same way. it is important to be aware, that's all. don't assume that just because it is costco it is cheaper. 

clothes were impressively high-end at this store (7 for all mankind jeans, under armour, etc.) and i'm stoked about that because most of my dear husband's work pants and polos come from costco. and i was especially thrilled to find my favorite (and expensive) Bliss bath products in an extra-large super value pack in the health/beauty section - at only $17.99. yay costco! yay low prices! yay friendly workers! 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Always love coming here. A trip here always boosts my mood! Costco treats their employees well and as a result we get great service, across the board, every single time. Not to mention smokin' deals! 

I'm sad to say I'm moving presently and will soon have a different Costco. I hope they measure up because from pharmacy to butchers to front staff to greeters/checkers, everyone here is sweet and friendly. I wish everyone at this store the very best. Thank you for your exemplary service."}
{"text":"Costco!  I can get discounted gas, a rotisserie chicken, huge bricks of cheese and mountains of paper towels all in one place.  Not to mention meat, and dog treats, and, and, and...

I recently visited this location after work, and was not entirely paying attention to what I was doing.  As I got up to the checkout line, I realized that I had put unsalted butter into my cart rather than the regular variety.  I was ready to head back to the far end of the store to return it (I think it is rude to leave things you don't want at the check stand and make it somebody else's problem) when the nice girl who was assisting the cashier offered to take it back to the refrigerator section for me.  Cool, thanks!  What was even better?  When she ran back up to the check stand with two kinds of salted butter (regular and organic) just in case I still wanted to make that purchase.  

She turned my mistake into a perfect example of good customer service.  :)"}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would! Terrible customer service. My eldery mother was screamed at by a cashier because she presented my brother's card and he was not there. Regardless, if of the right or wrong of whose card it was. No one deserves to be yelled at and belittled in public by a screaming banshee! She yelled so loud the people sitting eating pizza all turned to look at the commotion! Lucky for that cashier I wasn't there with my mother."}
{"text":"This Costco is definitely one of the best ones I have been to. Very clean, well stocked, friendly staff... 

The membership is definitely worth it if you like shopping bulk. We are a small family and mostly go there for non perishable items; but I really really like that Costco is now carrying a variety of organic products. I hope they will expand their selection even more in near future."}
{"text":"Recently we had the good fortune to have Michelle Whitehead a Costco travel agent help us book a cruise. She was so caring and thoughtful to what we wanted. She took the time to find us the best cruise and value for our needs. Michelle went above and beyond helping us. We will definitely use Costco travel for all of our next adventures"}
{"text":"Food Court=great food and it's cheap. 

People are happy to work there and it shows! 

Their prices are always fair. Never are they trying to kill you wallet or their own. It's truly conscious Capitalism."}
{"text":"This is a great store. I was here for a promotion with a large vodka company and the staff was incredibly nice and helpful. They made sure I had everything I needed and showed me around. Several employees came to check on me. I witnessed several employees proving samples to customers and they were working hard to sell the product. I appreciate the hard work. The store is very clean and well stocked. The smoothies at the food court are delicious and the employees serving them very friendly and helpful. I will definitely shop here."}
{"text":"I have written about this store before, but once again, they amaze me with good service. The optics department has blown my mind in the past with above and beyond service, and today it was Jessie in the returns department that took care of everything wrong I had purchased, and made me feel like there is hope still for good customer service and professionalism in retail. Fantastic job to whatever is making this store the best Costco in the valley!! And much to my wife's dismay, we will continue to patronize this location to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars annually. Well done."}
{"text":"I can't help but love Costco. I frequent the store as often as possible and find that the store is clean, organized, the bakery is fantastic and there's something about buying product in bulk. This is the only place I fill up on gas because it's always the cheapest in town. I've done my own financial analysis of the prices at Costco compared to Walmart and other grocery stores and find that Costco is as much as 50% cheaper than even Walmart."}
{"text":"I love Costco but not this one as much. I much prefer the one on Cave Creek and will only go to this one if we are at the mall and it is more convenient. It is smaller, and I don't like the layout as much."}
{"text":"I must say, this Costco has the most friendly, helpful employees I've ever been to. 
We purchased a few larger/bulky items and every employee we ran across were more than willing to assist with loading the items on the flatbed carts, loading the items into our vehicle, etc. Bravo Costco! Thank you guys for helping us!"}
{"text":"This place is OK Sundays as it is probably the best time commas in the morning they open at 10 every day and weekdays"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love costco?! The food court is so cheap! And the food samples while shopping are enough to fill most people up! Such great deals to be found here! Also the optical carries sunglasses! Who knew?! Ray ban, Maui Jim, Dior, etc."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza by phone from here and well everything was ok up to the point of picking up my order. There was a lady at the register and I was telling her that I ordered pizza by phone which by the way was one pepperoni and the other one supreme and I was also ordering a hot dog and berry berry sundae well while I was ordering she's taking my order in a rush like rushing me out of her presence after taking my order she takes the next gentlemen and saids to him \"oh I was trying to get you first I figured your on your break.\" So basically this lady rushes me the customer to order because she wants to get one of her coworkers order! When is that ok? So I decide to tell her in the nicest kindest way that she was being rude and it went something like this \"excuse me (name of person) you trying to rush me to order just because you were trying to take someone else's order was very rude, that shouldn't be done.\" Anyways after my long story here I don't appreciate the customer service provided to me today December 1, 2014 on the other hand the store I do really enjoy, especially when they have those free sample stands, it gives the opportunity to try something first before you buy and I love that more stores need to do this. Other than that overall I give this store 4 stars but just for that employee I'll give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I love Costco! This location in particular does a fairly good job at fulfilling my needs. Sometimes, they can be a little inconsistent with what they have on the shelves - but I suppose that it's the nature of such warehouse/store. Staff are for the most part friendly and welcoming, as they are efficient running the check out lines. 

I'll definitely continue coming to this location so long as I live nearby!"}
{"text":"Whats not to love about Costco.. lots of great samples, and a great selection of food. I use to belong to \"the other\" club warehouse and after visiting Costco with a friend I decided not to renew my other membership, they have way better brands and selection here. I can get everything I need at a one stop shop. The only downside to this location is the parking and how busy it can get. I try to avoid it in the evenings and weekends. The gas prices are always cheaper than any place around!"}
{"text":"Be careful with the produce.  Over the numerous times I've been there in the past few months, I've come across Moldy berries, strawberries and bags upon bags of moldy bell peppers.  There is a mold problem in their produce area...  Deep cleaning time!

And this is another update... Adding pictures.  All of their tomatoes had mold on them.  I looked at three different kinds and each variety had some form of mold.  I've frequented the Hayden and Beardsley Locations and never seen an issue with their produce."}
{"text":"I am a Costco fan...for many reasons:

The Meat - couldn't be better, and what a great price
The Cakes - Haven't had a better 'office cake' 
The online resources - believe it or not, I received the best insurance rates from costco (car and home), I got a great deal on a rental car, I have a fabulous closet and well 
The gas and the tires! - need I say more?
Mattresses are top of the line - 
Televisions - I love my Visio 

Then there is the returns policy, the exec membership with special benefits, the zip lock bags, the samples, the discounted booze, the horrible crowds, the neat holiday gifts, furniture, meds, vitamins, and the parking nightmare.

Where did the salt and pepper cashews go?
HELP ME ON THIS ONE!!"}
{"text":"this is the only Costco I know that makes you show your card before you can get in. Like you can even get out of the store with anything with out it at the check out. Not understanding the harassment of it aside from keeping the homeless people out? I mean Paradise Valley is a bit pretentious anyway but validating yourself in order to get in? Please. If you are going to the pharmacy you don't need a card just say pharmacy and walk in, that's what I do now I don't feel I need to dig my card out like it's some secret club I am walking in to.  Besides that the samples at every corner are ridiculous. Not only do people rarely buy the items but they rude block the aisles because they are more concerned about shoving their face full of free snacks. My husband and I rarely go and when we do we try to go right when they open so as to avoid the food grazers. But honestly?? enough with the card check in, it really isn't necessary especially when other Costco's aren't doing it seems to be along the lines of profiling."}
{"text":"The greeters at the door are rude. I was questioned like for just throwing trash away at the entrance when in fact I was waiting for my mother who is of older age. No longer will shop at this Costco! Those door people greeters do not treat people as guest! 0 stars!"}
{"text":"My friend Jenny and I went to Costco optical center to get her eyes examined and order her some contacts and glasses. I was impressed with the advanced equipment and professional staff and the variety of options available. We shopped for groceries after and got gas. So convenient: all in one place. Thanks Costco"}
{"text":"There gas station is one of my favorites. The lines always move fast and the person out in the area is polite. The photo center inside is one of my favorites also to send photos to since they are much quicker then other Costcos. Overall this my more desired costco. The lines are quick and I can usually find what  need and get in and out reasonable. I recommend going first thing in the morning right as they open if you want less crowds to do your shopping."}
{"text":"Usually this is my favorite Costco. Today, not so much. No package help, just frazzled cashiers."}
{"text":"What is going on here?  Are raising their prices with meat?  I went to 3 markets today, IGA, Fry's then Costco.  Those big pork roasts were $1.79 at IGA but $1.99 at both Fry's and Costco but Costco's are three times the size!  I thought you were supposed to save buying in bulk.  Since Fry's was not having a sale on their pork I just assumed it would be cheaper at Costco.

Still can't beat their prices on gas and their prices on prime beef, last time I checked, was pretty good and they are great steaks.  And I admit you can't beat Their rotisserie chicken for five dollars.  Another favorite is their salmon patties. I cook them on the grill and they're awesome.  I really miss their sole but they still have farmed salmon and talipia.  Please bring back the sole!"}
{"text":"The Christmas stuff is up and the Halloween candy is out!  Welcome to Costco! 

The new Costco at PV Mall is super nice!  It just opened and it's so clean and new and everyone is so nice.  The parking lot is a bit funky, the way it is positioned on the lot, you park on the sides of it.  

I walked up to get my brand new clean and unbroken cart, that feeling right there is enough to make me squeal with excitement, I hate grocery carts. 

It's laid out like every other single Costco, so nothing new in that department.  The staff is really nice and helpful.  

The best part is that the location on Beardsley will probably half the traffic since this one went up on Cactus."}
{"text":"Favorite store. What else to say. Amazing staff, amazing products and great value."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Costco I have ever been to. I have had my actual costco membership denied at this location on 2 separate occasions with enough proof to show who I am. If this company is really that strict on identifying the customer, makes me feel like a criminal or something. The employees and managers here just go through the motions and will not take the extra step time to help out the customer. This Costco has led me to the decision that I will not return to this location ever, and shop as little as possible at Costco ad more at SAMs and winco. To say the least F this store and location, spend your money elsewhere. 

Shop here if like to get shocked by your cart every 5 seconds. They do t even properly ground their shopping carts SMH. 

YOU GUYS SUCK"}
{"text":"This may be the worst Costco in the state.  I'm not sure.  Courtesy is lacking a bit, the produce doesn't seem to last as long, the line to get out the door is longer, and the pharmacy is the utter pits."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous Costco! It's not as busy as North Scottsdale and I think they have a great selection of wines.

I also buy the orthopedic dog beds whenever they have them. This is the only size my Dobie fits on and he loves the egg crate cushioning much better than the regular stuffing. AND...they're only $46!!! This bed would be triple the price anywhere else. That alone always brings me back!"}
{"text":"This must be the most popular Costco in Phoenix because at around noon on a Sunday, this place was a madhouse. Parking was crazy, like multiple people poaching spots and driving like...well...Californians. Additionally, the inside was packed and it just seemed a little more chaotic than I am used to...even for a Costco.

With that said, all your standard Costco qualities can be found here. Food Court, gasoline, bakery, deli items, clothes, alcohol, all the home goods. Hordes of people, those people that make meals out of samples, friendly staff, and all that other \"everything under the sun\" warehouse stuff you'd expect from Costco.

Overall this location is pretty easy to find but I was little put off by the parking lot pandemonium and crazy weekend crowds, I'll probably reserve this one to weekday and/or emergency shopping when visiting here."}
{"text":"Like children, every Costco is amazing in its own way. This is the first store I have found that serve Kirkland Signature Hot Dogs in Arizona. To the uninitiated, these hot dogs are twelve inches of perfection made with high quality USDA Choice Beef and natural seasonings and without corn syrup or nitrates. My girlfriend was in town and we drove all the way over from Glendale just to savor the goodness. At $1.50 they are an amazing value, too. Also, this store has the best selection of wine, beer and cheese I have seen at a Costco in Arizona."}
{"text":"The membership desk at this location has a rockstar named Nino P from Texas. They were so busy, yet he got on the phone and stayed on hold with other locations trying to locate a couch we wanted, at the same time serving other customers when he could.....and he was good humored about it, lifting our spirits because he could see our disappointment when we couldn't locate the couch. Seriously Costco, this guy is the employee everyone should want."}
{"text":"Good as far as the area.  Majority of the employees there are rude, think they are extra special and/or not happy working there.  They have forgotten that customers pay to shop there, which is how they get paid.  Upper management really needs to look in to what is wrong at this location. Compared to other Costco locations in and outside of AZ, it's like night and day, as far as most of the employees and some managers here.  The only reason I go to this one now, is because it's so close.  Most of the time, I really don't care if the employees suck, but on the rare occasion that I have to deal with a return or something else, I do care.  Pull your heads out!!"}
{"text":"The best Costco in AZ in terms of selection, highest quality, nicest jewelry / watches, and overall just everything. They have it all and the best of it all."}
{"text":"Without a doubt this location has the largest selection of upscale items from wines, watches, jewelry,  clothes and specialty items. 

Generally look at this location first and then compare with others. 

All the employees seem friendly and a little more up-ity which I describe as the opposite of a walmart night worker.

Their overall selection is just better than the other store with exclusive brand names such as Tommy Bahama,  Lucky Brand, Cartier,  Tag Heuer etc.

Just a cleaner and well kept store and not the busy fight like the store on Hayden Rd.

Also this is one of the lowest fuel prices of all costco stores which is a surprise because of the location. 

This is my favorite store and will continue to come back as my go to location."}
