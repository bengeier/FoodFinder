{"text":"My husband and I just had lunch there.. Having few Korean friends and having eaten in many Korean restaurants, I have had experienced many great Korean dishes.. 
Today we just wanted to try a new place and I found Makoto on yelp.. With positive reviews... Went there, I ordered beef Bulgogi, my husband vegetable and shrimp tempura... In my bulgogi there was little beef.. Very greasy... Very little rice, and above all it was tasteless, no flavour.. In my husband's tempura, there was only three shrimps and the rest was sweet potato tempura or something like that.. Bad experience, and if you are reading to go there.. Dont bother and try a different place"}
{"text":"I was extremely pleased with my visit here.

Located near the northern end of Little Italy, this newly opened Korean-Japanese restaurant is truly a delight.

The decor is pleasant, but nothing too special; they took over from an older restaurant; it's not a new construct. The server is quite pleasant and the menu is detailed and comprehensive. They have a decently wide range of items, including takoyaki, udon, yakiudon, okonomiyaki, etc.

Prices are quite affordable: 11-13 dollars in general for bentos and noodles, while certain dishes like the galbi are closer to 18. Tempura and karaage are around 14 for large orders. They also have sushi and sashimi, which range in the 18 to 28 dollar range.

They stay open until 9 o'clock, but if you're there already they won't force you out even if it's past 9. 

The meal presentation is extremely tasteful and clean, and added a lot to the dining experience.

Now the food! Everything was fresh and hot. The salad is a sesame-vinaigrette common to many Japanese restaurants, and the miso soup is quite delicious. I ordered the takoyaki appetizer, which was also fresh and hot, and quite flavourful. For the main I had the pork katsu bento, which includes spring rolls, vegetable tempura, and garlic potatoes on top of rice. The katsu was freshly fried and hot, with a sweet and tangy katsu sauce complemented by spicy mayo. We also ordered karaage (fried chicken) to share, which was delicious.

Overall this was an extremely pleasant experience and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is good! Had katsu bento and spicy beed soup!! Very cozy resto with nice jap decorations!"}
{"text":"I don't like the food here. Not So many choices, not good sushi and they don't even have beef teriyaki. Will never come back hefe again"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best bibimbap I've had outside of Los Angeles. The salad and soup were equally good. All for $13, quite the deal.  Service was friendly and quick and the decor is a eclectic mix of Japanese and Korean."}
{"text":"Their gamjatang had more bones than meat. Their seaweed salad had more cabbage than seaweed. The place is clean and the service is pleasant, though."}
{"text":"have just had dinner with Asian food hunters. we reserved our place in advance but wasnt crowded at all. maybe its still too new. anyway lucky us to stay for like 3hrs.

food was beautiful and creative. i paid like 12.50$ and got shrimp fries/spring roll/tempura/even fried potate on my plate, on top of rice. there is more luxualy choice like sushi and sashimi as well.

but best part of this resto was their \"cleaness\". not only bcz its new, but also their way to serve, to clean the table, to pour water, to present dishes... they are really careful in many ways. good service."}
{"text":"Just looking at the outside reminds me of Japanese menus in Tokyo.
Colorful pictures with each plate and price put right on the street, I love it

I had a the bulgogi plate, BBQ Korean Beef Bento Box ($12:95)
comes with soup, salad, mixed veggies and rice.

Awesome, the tempura veggies were perfect.

I wanted to try their sushi, but the selection is limited and bit pricey, so better for next time on it's own.

It's definitely a rare gem and not unlike anything else in this area."}
{"text":"J'ai vraiment aimé cet endroit; calme, tranquille et à la déco simple et sympa. 
Nous avons commandé plusieurs plats variés. J'apprécie particulièrement que les classiques japonais et coréens partagent le même menu.
Tous les plats sont servis avec salade et soupe (sauf si on prends une soupe comme plat principal). 
La crêpe au chou et fruit de mer japonaise (okonomiyaki) était moelleuse à l'intérieur, croustillante sur les bords et très bien garnie de pieuvre et crevettes. 
Vraiment un coup de cur! 
Tout le reste était aussi vraiment bien fait (côtes levées bien épicées, escalope de poulet panée tendre et croustillante, etc) et les portions très généreuses. Le rapport qualité/quantité/prix est très bon. 
Je retournerai sans doute bientôt pour essayer les autres plats."}
{"text":"Small menu (expecially for sushi) but its good. The takoyaki were amazing. The price were amazing as well."}
{"text":"Un bon petit resto coréen avec plein de choix
La bouffe a l'air très fraiche
Excellent service rapide avec une petite salade en entrée
Petit hic sur les tempura que j'ai trouvé très gras
Par contre le poisson qui était dedans était très bon!
A essayer!"}
{"text":"So let's go straight to the point : their salmon salad is really delicious. It didn't feel like an authentic Japanese salad but I'm not even mad because I just really enjoyed it. Now, their seafood udon isn't the best udon I had. Let's just say it's not packed with flavours and it kinda felt a bit cheap. But in the past, I tried their shrimp bento and it was really good. I would probably not order their udon again but I'll definitely come back for the salmon salad and their bento boxes. Also, the ambiance is quiet and intimate which is nice when you want to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Nice fusion Japanese/Korean place on St-Laurent. 
We started with the wasabi octopus - amazing - seriously you have to try this and you will want to eat more and more and more forever and ever.
We then had the gamjatang and the bulgogi - both were good and quite filling - you won't leave hungry that's for sure!
The service is very friendly and the food is good. It's neither completely Japanese nor completely Korean so if you're looking to try typical food from one of those you might be disappointed as this is really rather a mix of both kinda place."}
{"text":"Tried out this adorable hidden treasure located right in the heart of little Italy and truly enjoyed the experience and the food!  Makoto is a Korean/Japanese resto serving many wonderful dishes. The resto itself is small but good for a group of 12 max..reservations are highly recommended as it is has become a popular place. The ambiance and decor is really cozy and modern with it's lightbulb fixtures filled with flowers. So pretty! The service is absolutely great ..superfriendly and warm. The food was delicious and reasonably priced..not expensive at all for the great quality
We tried several dishes which were beautifully plated and yummy!! I would definately recommend this place for a date, night out with friends, birthday celebrations or family supper!
Check out my pictures of the food!"}
{"text":"Service is very good. Food is not as good as I expected, but not bad. The quantity is so much."}
{"text":"Excellent, everything was fresh and taste perfect.
We tried the takowasabi, udon noodle and bento box shrimp.
way better than other japanese / korean in Montreal."}
{"text":"Took a terriyaki chicken Bento! Amazing! The portion is perfect! Served with a little miso soup and a salad. Would go back again!"}
{"text":"I've come here three times to date and it had always been great! All the bento are beautifully crafted and delicious. Some of the best Japanese food I've had in Montreal, certainly the best in the area. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Price reasonable. Good portion.  Good to share
It is more Korean meals than Japanese foods. 
I like the pork bone soup. Salmon sushi is good, big piece and fresh salmon. Not too cheap but a little bit too much of rice"}
{"text":"Bonne petite adresse japonaise \"under cover\" sur Saint-Laurent.

C'est tranquille, joli et discret. 

La nourriture est bonne et le service ok.

Prix très raisonnables."}
{"text":"The food is okay - I had the chicken katsu with cheese, which was awfully sweet, and despite being a \"bento box\" it came with only one piece of tempura and a salad with way too much sweet dressing. Also there was some kind of mashed potato in the chicken, which was weird. 

Worse than that though was the fact that the service ignored me completely the whole time I was there. I was the only one in the restaurant and the only waiter was playing video games. The chef had to refill my water because he acted like I wasn't there. I could see his computer from my table - he was playing games at the bar!

Won't be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Just had one of the freshest korean meal in a long time! The most delicious Gamjatang, spicy pork soup and amazing fish tempura with a perfectly suited Miyazaki soundtrack. It's a new restaurant in Petite-Italie neighborhood and I highly suggest it! Miam!"}
{"text":"J'ai été très satisfait tant du service que de la qualité de la nourriture dans ce restaurant. Les prix sont excellents, la présentation est soignée et tout ce qu'on a goûté était délicieux. Nous avons pris entrées et plats Coréens dans leur menu et sommes sortis très satisfaits! C'est une petite merveille cachée de la petite Italie que peux recommander avec confiance. Vous ne serez pas déçus!"}
{"text":"Recommand for couple night out. The Chicken Karaage was really good. Highly recommand. But the pork bento was 8/10."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  The soy sauce Korean ribs were the bomb, flavorful, fall off the bone, crunchy a bit and broiled to perfection.  The Japanese pancake, Okonomiyaki, was like what I had in Japan, full of vegetables with a great sauce.  The golden gate roll was big but the rice was a bit dry.  Overall great place but they need to improve the service and it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here twice; one time with a friend and the second time was with my family.
Food was good, but do not expect authentic Korean or Japanese food. It's a fusion kind of restaurant. 
As for their services, it was really good.
The price is fair for the quantities we get."}
