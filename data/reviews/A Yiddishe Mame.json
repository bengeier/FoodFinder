{"text":"Worst food ever.  Everything is drenched in oil.  Service was terrible too.  We had a party of 20 people and one waitress.  You know those Russian restaurants where they just keep piling food on your table and leave it there all night?   This is one of them.  Disgusting!!!!"}
{"text":"What they serve here is Russian Jewish food.  I think the only difference between the food here and what I can at my in laws at home is waiter service. The choice in food is identical to what we get at home, and probably just different from typical russian Restauarnt due to the absence of pork and lots of cheese.   It's small and with 2 waitresses the service was decent. Our meals didn't all come at the same time and about 10mins between the last two dishes.   Yes it's quite oily but not overly saturated. We had the lamb...  Ordered by piece and really big almost a meal in it self. I got the special lamb shank and it was a decent size but small for the price of $16 in my opinion. It was braised and fall off the bone. Also had the stuffed chicken neck   which was good but not sure where the chicken neck was and what was stuffed in it.   Biggest complaint is the poor temperature control. Sitting neat the window it was either 30 degrees with hot air blowing at you or immediately switching to cold air of 10degrees blowing at you. It was really uncomfortable to be there for over 3 hrs.   There were few things on the menu that were really unique to a traditional home cooked meal so if I would skip this if you make this regularly. Otherwise it might be worth a visit in the area."}
{"text":"Loved the lunch menu and price! The best $10 spent if food ever!! The soup is amazing! Same to pelmeni and main dish!  Looking fwrd to book a private party celebration for my MIL , she'll love it!"}
{"text":"Probably going to be my favourite restaurant. A great value, beautiful meat, and great service. Try the lamb chops with crispy potatoes!"}
{"text":"I went there with my little son. I didn't know much about the food on the menu, and I liked it that the waitress was very helpful and patient. We liked the experience and we will definitely come back. I wish there were booths and not only open concept, but it was cozy and tasty."}
{"text":"Despite the negative reviews on yelp, I had to give this place a try and I'm glad I did. You need to have a certain familiarity with the Jewish-European culture to fully feel comfortable; however, even if you go with an open mind I'm sure you could find something you'd love. Everything is homecooked and you can taste the effort and love that has gone into each course.  The interior d√©cor mimics the inside of a log cabin. However, it's a nice and relaxed atmosphere. The servers are friendly and attentive, my dad and I appeared to catch them off guard with some of our questions but were always quick with an answer.  Both my dad and I started with soup. I had the chicken with matzo ball which was very similar to how my bubby (grandmother) used to make it. My dad had the broccoli soup which he also enjoyed except found a bit more peppery than usual.  For our mains: I had the chicken schnitzel with mashed potatoes. Everything was wonderful, although the highlight was the homemade mashed potatoes. Delish! Dad had the lamb shank with salad and aside from his unhappiness that the garden salad is served with an oil-based dressing, he seemed content.  For dessert, I had the apple streussal. Full of fresh apples and just had the right amount of crisp to it.  Price is reasonable for the portions you receive and considering everything is homemade. Yes, they do bring dishes out as they are ready and don't necessarily wait for all of the dishes of the same course. But I really believe this might be another cultural trait that is incorporated into the dining experience.  Only downside, they are not strictly kosher. They will serve meat and milk in the same meal just (from what I can tell) not on the same plate.  There is no doubt I will be a returning customer. I already can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Very recommended restaurant. I go there at least ones a week . Perfect lunch like home . What my mom used to make :))) thank you"}
{"text":"First of all, in case these were not obvious, two facts: this is a Russian restaurant and they serve traditional jewish food. The food is not kosher certified, so if you're on the extreme end of the religious spectrum or don't like Russian food, this place is not for you.   I am certainly not the target audience (non-russian, non-jewish) but the food was good. Even as a vegetarian, they had lots of good choices. It may not be the highest whole-foods kind of quality food, but it's good decent food.   The place looked clean and the service was reasonable."}
