{"text":"First time trying.. I ordered the pulled pork nachos $8.00 with Cheese, Sour Cream and Jalapenos and a side of Mac and Cheese $3.00.   I didn't have to wait long for my order. I then  went to the area where the sauces were on the left side of the truck.  There are only two different types of bbq sauce - red and white.  I asked for a little to-go container (little cup) to take some sauce with me because I didn't want my nachos to be soggy when I got back to work.. and was told they don't have any and to just put some in the corner of the container? These little cups are cheap too.  I was surprised they didn't provide them.  So I had to squirt the sauces in each corner of my container under my foil?   

Then I looked for napkins - no napkins? - provided on a bbq food truck!?  This was a first.  What was provided was little napkin inside plastic utensils that wasn't even suitable or large enough to wipe the mouth of a newborn baby.   Arrived at work - excited and ready to enjoy my nachos and mac and cheese.. so opened the container of the nachos and was it was then I noticed the tiny portion size for $8.00 ?   It was smaller than an appetizer portion even.  There was a lot of extra room in the container. The red sauce was too sweet and the white sauce was a little better.. but it was hard to know for sure since there wasn't to-go containers.. they mixed together in my container. Onto the ... Mac and Cheese. .. the color was different.. lighter color yellow than expected..  but figured maybe different cheese was used.. but no that wasnt the case... it was very bland.  I had to put salt n pepper on it-- still no good - then put some bbq sauce on it and was then edible.   I wish I hadn't ordered and paid $3.00 for small side of bland mac n cheese.   It was a below average lunch for $12.00 total.  Luckily here was pizza left over from a meeting since I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Tried their truck in truck Park at Millvale. I ordered  rack of ribs. It was cold and was underdone for my taste. Went to them and asked for another entree. I was treated royally and kindly. I got a pulled pork sandwich. The comfort you expect from that... 4 stars for the rib mishap 5 stars for treatment. Keep up the good work.
(As i was writing this, a couple sitting next to me was also examining their rib and one of them was trying to decide whether to partake. Made me feel less fussy :) must be a matter of taste)"}
{"text":"Was at Nova Place and found out Evil Swine was set up.  Was told they are usually there on Wednesday.  It must be a hit because the line was a little long but worth it.  Even though the food came out fast we were in line for about 30 minutes.
Before we got to order they erased the chicken off of the white board menu.  
Had the pulled pork with cheddar and slaw with a side of Mac & Cheese.  The pulled pork was very good...nice flavor with a little of the bbq smoke flavor and tender.  The Mac was very good and it seemed to have just a tad of red pepper to give it a little heat to go with a creamy cheese.   There  are two bottles with sauce, a Alabama white that is very good with some spice and a red.  
If you are in the area, stop and try it out."}
{"text":"The food truck came to my work place up on Beaver Avenue. It was a nice treat for lunch. I got the pulled pork sandwich with Monterey cheese and put regular BBQ sauce on it. Was a very filling sandwich. Next time I think I'll try the nachos - which looked so delicious as well."}
