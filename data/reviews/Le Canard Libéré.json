{"text":"Mais où sont les poutines d'antan?? 

TRAGIC DEVELOPMENT: Le Canard Libéré no longer prepares the legendary duck confit poutine, or any other duck dish to eat on-site, for that matter. Only pastries and coffees are offered at the little cafe, now. And they all taste like sadness. 

Rest assured that the store is still a premium purveyor of everything duck....and for that, coupled with the facts that their prices are reasonable and their staff, wonderful, they still can squeeze 4 stars out of me. 

But I'm still pouty about losing that poutine."}
{"text":"What a duck luvers paradise (the gourmet kind). Foie Gras! Foie Gras everywhere with a reasonable prices to boot this is a must if you want a one stop shop for all your duck related product needs. This place has a modern and clean look which is in contrast from the usual purveyors of food products in big marches' that  line Montreal. 
They also other items like some cooking books, spices etc and when they are on clearance can make them worthwhile.
The prices were very good for Foie Gras and are much lower for frozen stuff when comparing with the store in the marches'.
They also sell gelato which is interesting but a good way to diversify their clientele. As other YEB/YDB mentioned they don't have the poutine anymore so I missed out on it. I think I have found my new place to load up before heading out of Montreal. 
I think they can use with a tasting area of sorts (the only sign of trouble in foie gras paradise)"}
{"text":"Si vous n'aimez pas la viande de canard, si vous êtes amis des canards, si vous êtes contre la production de foie gras ou si encore vous êtes végétarien, alors passez votre chemin. Pour tous les autres, welcome au royaume du canard! Foies gras donc, mais aussi gésiers, rillettes, et confits vous accueilleront ici comme il se doit! Mais pas seulement, vous trouverez aussi de nombreux produits fins, un peu du genre que l'on a généralement dans ce genre d'épicerie haut de gamme : des huiles et vinaigres en veux-tu en-voilà, des confiotes, des biscottes et tout le toutim."}
{"text":"Imagine this....   

As I look up upon the bubble cloud above my head.

Majestic serene beauty of Brome Lake as picturesque as Swan Lake[1].
Ducks land on the calm lake surface creating symmetric surrounding ripples.
Soft quacks break the silence as another Pair gently takes flight.  End scene[2].

It's my imagery and I'll dream however I wish.   :P
              
When Peking Ducks are naturally raised...          Ducks fly together!
When Ducks get clean temp-control homes...     Ducks fly together!
When Le Canard Libéré makes Poutine[3]...       Ducks fly together!
When said Poutine makes me drool[4]...                 

Sorry Daffy!  It's Duck Hunting season[5].

[1] Theatrical Ballet.  A Princess turned into a Swan by an evil Sorcerer's curse.
[2] Le Canard Libéré is a not a lake. It's part Duck Gourmet Shop, part Cafe Bistro.
[3] La Canardine = Duck Leg Confit + Duck Fat Fries  + Curds + Duck Stock Gravy
[4] Tender seasoned Duck & Crisp Fries w/ Squeaky Curds drowned in Liquid Gold
[5] Lots of %-off products available due to near-expiry.  I hunt those down."}
{"text":"Now this is MY kind of place - a gourmand shop dedicated to ALL things DUCK & Foie Gras. You bet I left with goodies!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were on a vacation to Montreal and I heard about this duck market, and I was on a quest, NAY! A mission to find fois gras.

This store had only duck. There was dead duck everywhere. It was like a canard heavan. Fois gras liver was spilling out of this place like an overweight lady with a halter top over her too tight shorts.

The freezers were packed, the fridges were full of the over fed goose liver.

We didn't buy anything, but the vast assortment of Donald and Daffy was amazing. 

If I lived here, this would be a monthly trip for sure."}
{"text":"So sad...

We walked all the way to Le Canard Libere and thinking I can have a taste of their Poutine again.... but they no longer has that on the menu anymore.

The service though is still so good! The staff let me sampled some of their products and so welcoming too!

On a happier note, now I can find a lot of their duck products in grocery stores in Toronto area... but where are the Foie Gras! I want that!!! I want!!!"}
