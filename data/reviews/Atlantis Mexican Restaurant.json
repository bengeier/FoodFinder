{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. I feel like I went to my Nanas house and ate. Truly recommend. Nice look and good customer service. First time here and definitely will be coming here more often. Will let my family and friends in the area know how good it was. Fresh made guacamole!!"}
{"text":"Ok. Came here during spring break at lunchtime and it blew my mind. My mom was with me and we fell in love. Our waitress Karen was adorable and so attentive we couldn't wait to get back.  Today we went in for a late lunch/early dinner and what a disappointment. The toritos we had last time were bomb. Today they were not. The presentation was completely different. We asked for the sauce they used last time. I even shared a photo that I'd taken. The chef brought back some weird peach cream sauce that was gross.  Maybe this place is only good at lunch time. They had a 5 star rating 1st visit, zero star rating 2nd visit. We saw a family come in, seat themselves, wait, wait, never got acknowledged after 10-15 minutes they left. Don't think the staff ever even noticed. Service was so slow.  Giving a 3 star rating as an average between the 2 visits."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner on a Saturday night.  The meal was delicious.  Exactly one week later, at the same time of day, we went with another couple.  The meal was awful.  The taco meat was dry and inedible.  There was no sour cream or salsa/pico de gallo with it.  The fajitas had no seasoning.  Again, it did not come with any sour cream, salsa, pico, guacamole.  The stuffed jalapenos are not jalapenos at all.  I can't go back again. It just isn't worth it.  There are places that are so much better.   I really wanted to like this place, but I can't."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican food restaurant now. I love their micheledas and their shrimp cocktail"}
{"text":"Got here was told to pick a booth took a little before waitress came over but not to bad of a wait we got 2 horchatas that were ok were asked if we wanted chips and salsa said yes and got a basket with really good salsa but the chips omg were gross cold oily stale had chunks of god knows what all fried and hard at the bottom very disappointed because salsa was so good. We ordered shrimp ala diabla and an atlantis torta food was actually really tasty and didnt taste bad at all. But the whole ordeal with the chips kinda ruined that meal were going to give it a try one more time before we completly give up ."}
{"text":"Walked In no one to meet you music way to loud was there 10 minutes and not one person helped us our party walked out and went to Carolinas bad start for a new business. Sad cause what food we could smell smelled good   Lost a good party of people                 Zzzzzzzxxsaf sad sad"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. The atmosphere is half dance floor part bar and booths and tables for dining. I had the pescado a la diabla and the sauce was out of this world amazing and spicy. There sushi is big and filling full of flavor. The staff is friendly and if you happen to play Pokemon go there is a pokestop there you can keep spinning every 5 minutes. It's a must go of you want authentic tasty Mexican food."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but the food to put it simply is not good at all. We ordered the Atlantis omelet that was supposed to come with sausage... the \"sausage\" was hot dogs. The pork tacos were dry and the texture of dust. Disappointing."}
