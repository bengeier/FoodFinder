{"text":"This place is great! My boyfriend and I spent an afternoon at the Banya for a sauna, massages, and dinner and had a great time. The experience is quite different from a typical spa day, in the best way. They've got a big indoor area with picnic tables, a pool table, music, and a small sauna all at your disposal to use as you please. Upon arrival, we were given towels and robes and told to make ourselves at home. The table was set with beautiful and delicious little Russian salads and appetizers which had been freshly prepared for us. The facility is also BYOB! We didn't know that, but the manager has bottles of Georgian semi-sweet wine available for sale. The wine was pretty sweet, but I thought it was an nice compliment to the food. 

Over the course of the afternoon, we relaxed in the sauna - I recommend going back and forth between the hot sauna and cold shower - each got a massage, and hung out in the common room eating and drinking. The massage was very relaxing. The therapist was great at finding the areas where I told tension and spending a lot of time working them out. I felt very welcome throughout the whole experience. The manager came around every now and then to check on us and was nice to talk to, though I never felt pressured to hurry or purchase upgraded treatments.  

It's clear that the Banya would be wonderful for larger groups. The full steam and sauna facilities are available for groups of 8 or more, and I can see how it would be really fun to go there with a group of friends for relaxation, eating and drinking in the big common room. Overall, I highly recommend this place! The prices are really reasonable, the treatments are fabulous,  and the food is excellent!

Note: as other reviewers have mentioned, since they prepare the whole space for guests, do call ahead to make a reservation, especially if you want to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really looking forward to visiting this banya. We came on a Sunday around 1:30 pm, but the place was closed. The hours on the door indicated that it should be open, but no one was there, and there was no signage about special hours or a private party. When I called, it went straight to voicemail.

I would love the chance to review it in earnest, but for now, this is all I've experienced."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a Bachelorette party or a girls spa day! Great place, clean and comfy. The food was good as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting friends in Cleveland and she was pushing to find some time to relax and get massage.  Usually my rampant testosterone prevents such girlie adventures as \"Spa Days\" but it had been awhile since I had a massage and I knew it would do me some good.  

Our friends told us about Banya Tamazonka, a spa that has wet and dry saunas along with massage therapists on staff.  They also serve authentic Russian cuisine which I didn't expect but was a nice surprise being that my wife is a certified Yelp foodie freak and neither of us have ever had authentic Russian food.

Going into this I didn't really have high expectations.  I mean its Cleveland, not the Halekulani on the beach in Waikiki, but surprisingly enough it was very nice.  We started off by relaxing together in the saunas and followed it up with a massage.  The therapist was quite good.  I could tell she knew what she was doing and she had plenty of strength to work the knots out of my muscles.

It wasn't as luxurious as other spas I've been to, but was still well maintained, clean and inviting plus it was much more affordable.  They also had some unique touches I've never seen before like birch twigs in the sauna to help exfoliate your skin while you're sweating it up.  

We only intended to stay for the spa and massage but I was getting hungry so we had dinner there as well.  Diana the chef, prepares home cooked Russian food with some VERY generous portions.  If you do decide to eat there do it after the massage because you will be too full to enjoy one after you eat.

All in all a great little place to relax in Cleveland and would definitely go there again if I was in town."}
