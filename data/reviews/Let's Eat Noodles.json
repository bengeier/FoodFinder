{"text":"Very authentic Chongqing food! Mmmmmmm bowel obstructingly good! Nice environment with awesome staff! The beef wraps were great!"}
{"text":"This is our new place for some authentic, Chinese spice loaded dishes! The dishes are very flavorful but that means they are really strong (which I personally like and am OK with), so be aware. Our favorite of the day was the pickled string bean and minced meat noodle. YUM. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Besides the noodles, the BBQs are also soooo good! The BBQ garlic pork and eggplant are very tasty"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food place I've found in Az. It's really authentic Chinese food. Will come often to try everything later."}
{"text":"Real authentic food!  The spicy noodle soup even on a hot day was awesome. Bursting with all the right flavors. They also have these Chinese burritos which must be tried!  Had the pork burrito and they serve it with pickled beans. Amazing flavor combination. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Gud. May be too oily for others. I used to love the pricing for their BBQ skewers part of the menu, ~$6 for 5 lamb skewers, which is a really great deal compared to other restaurants. But recently they changed the menu again and took off the BBQ menu, which makes me less likely to go back there now."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who had highly recommended their noodles, but soon came to find that their menu and chef had changed. Not knowing what to expect, the four of us ordered four dishes to share family style. We ordered the traditional tofu and salted egg, pork belly with pickled greens, diced chicken and spicy pork with chili peppers. We were all extremely impressed! One of our friends at the table was from that particular part of China and said the dishes and flavors were absolutely authentic! Would definitely come back any day!"}
{"text":"I've been here through every step on the way, they've changed the menu about 6 times. The cooks constantly change. Sometimes it's insanely hot, sometimes it's bland. They took the cold case stuff off the menu, and the green beans. They've severed me meat when I requested none at least 3 different times. I'm usually so accommodating to authentic Chinese places. But this place is just awful. Menu, staff, cooks.... Makes me sad to lose an authentic option, but we still have Chou's, and Chengdu around here."}
{"text":"The Pork Intestine Xiao Mien is simply delicious. Very authentic taste. The second thing we got was the stir-fry salty pork belly which was outstanding. This restaurant is quite small but the service was exceptional. The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"We loved this place, xiao mian is a very popular Chinese cuisine from Chungking and I've always wanted to try it. I ordered #37 , the beef was very tender, the broth was tasty and peanuts added good flavor to the soup. Noodles were also very tasty, they dont have any dough flavor. We also ordered their home made icy jelly which is a popular local cuisine in summer time, it's very refreshing and authentic . Waiters and waitresses were super friendly. We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great quality food and very tasty! One of the best Chinese restaurants I have been to. I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food. I felt for noodle soup and found this little spot. The food is very good and tastes like my grandparents cooking! They just opened two weeks ago. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great, and only a mile from my house! Get the garden pea soup it's great."}
{"text":"Salty, spicy and totally addictive. After I ate here I was craving their noodles for days. It's a causal atmosphere and the staff are really nice. Delicious tradition  Chinese noodles. I had the ground pork with fresh garden peas yum."}
{"text":"So yum!! Apparently this is what \"traditional Chinese noodles\" are like, not what Americans are used to.. and it's so good! 

I'm nervous of spicy food, so I got #41, which was similar to ramen/udon/pho in that it has noodles in broth with pieces of meat.  Can't go wrong with that combination!!
 

But I also got to try #39, which was spicy noodles (without broth) and numbing peppers -maybe a little too much heat for me to eat all by myself, but it was delicious to try!  #24, the BBQ fish cake, was also delicious, but spicier than even the #39, so I couldn't eat very much.. but the plum juice and magic jelly desert helped cool me down 

All in all, I'd definitely recommend this place, and I can't wait to come back and try new items!! Maybe I'll even be brave enough to switch to a spicier option!"}
{"text":"The worst Ramen I ever had! Also the worst dinner experience ever! It was our first time & our last! 1st off the menu had no description so our waitress had to explain everything. I ordered the vegetable Ramen which only had five pieces a bok Choi, a sprinkle of canned corn and a few chopped peanuts and it comes with an egg but they ran out! Really! and my husband ordered spicy chicken bits which turned out to be breaded chicken bones!! He thought it was breaded chicken pieces so he bit into it almost broke his tooth!! when I called the waitress  over and asked her why there was so many bones she said that it was normal and that is how it was made...i explained that it was not edible and that if they would have provided better explanation on their menu we wouldn't of ordered it. She called her coworker over and I explained to her as well. I asked them how can anyone eat this with so many bones?! I also explained that she (the waitress) never told us it was breaded bone and neither did the menu! And if we could please order something else. she gave me an off putting look and then turned around and told her coworker something in Mandarin while they were standing right in front of our table. I'm sorry but that is really rude to speak another language in front of customers when you are both capable of speaking English and standing directly in front of us!Never going back, I honestly don't understand how they have so many good reviews...?"}
{"text":"New owner, the menu had been changed. Highly not recommended.  The noodle dish is really bland."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Chinese place in town. Overpriced dish and not enough food in each. Went there for the high ratings, was very disappointed with the food and service. The noodles taste average, and taste like MSG (you can feel the thirst after MSG). They do suspected tax evasion practice too, asking you to pay cash over card with a discount on the price as incentive. Won't recommend it to friends and family.

To the response from the restaurant:
Your defensive & passive aggressive response reflects the way you treat your customers: hostile & irrespecutful. Also, you can stop lying about MSG. You know you use MSG in your food. Taste buds don't lie. Using MSG is Okay, lying is not. Again, I am not recommending your place. Your attitude to your customers is as disastrous as your business."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Chinese food, this is the place to go. The staff is super friendly and will answer all your questions. I had #51 and it was the best noodle dish I've ever had. My son had #44 and he agrees, it's the best. We live in in OC CA wherever there are tons of good and authentic Chinese restaurants. This is better."}
{"text":"Slow, very slow. Was there at 11:40 they took our order at 12:00, the food came to the table at 12:30. Food was very bland and they had no condiments on table, no chili oil, no white pepper, no Sriracha and not even salt or black pepper. Extremely over priced. What would normally be a $20 lunch for two people cost $45 without beverages, only water. Maybe they didn't add spices because I was a gringo but I prefer authentic, not American style. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I was a member of Julia G's group on MON, 07 AUG. I concur with the excellent, friendly service that she reported. The \"menu\" on the wall appears to be a lame attempt at copying the trend of \"build-your-own\" burrito, pizza, or ramen, but it doesn't jibe w/ the fixed-item printed menu. As far as the food goes, there's no point in my adding more of the same, accurate comments, besides reiterating that I wish we had the $10 back that we spent on the deep-fried minnow jerky. Terrible, even though the salty, cumin dusted coating was delicious. To paraphrase the old Burger King commercial, \"Where's the fish?\" Julia's pork intestine broth had a spicy edge, but not worth returning for - not even at half the price. Meager portions of meat, veggies, noodles, & soup. I cannot fathom that others rated this place 5 stars! There are just too many other great places to patronize."}
{"text":"The menu has very little English on it, and apparently it is incorrectly translated in places. Spent $45 for two meals and two cans of soda - and wasn't completely full when I left. Considering all of the options in this area, I won't go again. Tasty, but not worth the cost."}
{"text":"So good! Delicious noodle soups of different varieties. Spicy dishes are actually a bit spicy. The mushroom and short rib is comfort food."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try xiaomian, but I was really disappointed. They changed their menu and there is no xiaomian anymore! I still tried the noodle and I have to say it was really horrible. The noodle was over boiled and the sauces didn't taste good. Any way, I will not come back again."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here before and had a good time. Ambience is very casual and the food is great!  The associates were very nice and made sure everything was to our liking. Prices are more than fair for the amount of food you get too."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here, I'm happy. My Malaysian belly finds this type of cuisine comforting. So this opinion will not necessarily sit well with everyone. Top 3 favs r braised pork belly, salted egg tofu, toothpick lamb"}
{"text":"Too pricy but the food is authentic . I like their bbqs. Noodle can be super spicy! Watch out!"}
{"text":"I was 90% excited by this place. But I should have set my expectations lower. While the thought of traditional Chongqing is a good one for Chandler, the food was mediocre and not really unique in taste and ingredients. I would also request that the restaurant be more aware of cleanliness. We found a hair in our tea cup, and then a hair in our side dish. There were hardly any people in the small restaurant and yet our grilled eggplant came out to us after we were long done with out noodles. This makes me also think that the noodles were already cooked before we arrived and just added to its soup when we ordered. Overall, it was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Not for me.  I ordered the beef noodle soup, but it was more like noodles swimming in chili oil.  No soup to be found.  No beef either, just a few scraps of fat."}
{"text":"The cold dish is awesome. Noodle is above expectations. Staff is friendly. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good, however the reason for the lack of stars is for the poor service. I asked the server to explain to me the specific type of noodles on the spicy noodle bowl. All she could tell me was that they were made from potatoes. When my daughter and I received our food, we took 2, only 2 bites of the food to discover the noodles were equivalent to chewing on tires! We asked our server if we could switch our order to the same soup, just different noodles. The server stated that the only option was for me to be charged for 2 additional bowls of soup, because we tasted the order.  No type of service accommodations were made. 

We weren't offered any water refills, nor napkins throughout the meal. To say the least, the food was good however my family and I won't ever visit this establishment again!!! I'm GOOD, Let's NOT EAT NOODLES!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant multiple times.  The food tastes great, and the setting is quaint.  However, the service today was terrible. We sat down, ordered, and were told an hour later that our order ticket was lost and the waitress needed our order again. We asked how long it would be at this point and were told \"just a few minutes\". Twenty minutes later, still no food, so we told them to cancel the order and we left. This is really unfortunate because the food tastes great, but it's not worth the service."}
{"text":"I have the Spicy Beef Noodle soup as take out after they have changed to brand new menu. It was quite good even after reheating after 30 minutes of driving back home.

They have new hours, I suggested to Yelp to get the hours updated, so maybe they will do it soon. Closed Tuesdays and closed between 3pm-5pm between lunch and dinner. 

I hate when businesses don't keep their hours updated across public sites and listings, especially on their own website and FB page, so 3 stars for now.

Will update this review after a couple more visits."}
{"text":"I had the Braised Intestine Xiao Mian and it was amazing! I came without any expectations, but on my first bite, it surprised me and took me back to the food I ate in China years ago because there is nowhere else around here that uses the strong combination of spices and richness in the broth that could only come from boiling the bones over a long period of time. They used thin rice noodles which is the way to go, and it was the right consistency. Did not get as much of the intestines as I thought, but the ones I ate had a lot of flavor. I'll probably get the Braised Beef Xiao Mian next time and hope for better portions.

A couple things to know: 
-The spiciness might be a lot hotter than you expect. 
-10% discount when paying in cash.
-Limited seating. They just had those those 6 person picnic like tables, so in the small restaurant it fit maybe 10 tables. Many of them there had only two people sitting there. It's weird they didn't include smaller tables meant for groups of four or couples.
-If you enjoy the soup here, I'd recommend also giving the ramen at Nishikawa Ramen in Gilbert a try!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese Restaurant. I have been there several times, the food is good. If you want to try the original Chinese taste you should go there! Highly recommend the noddle and cold dishes."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from other friends and read a review from our local critic/AZ Central.  Once I arrived, I realized I had been here before when it was House of Egg Roll.  I tried one of their signature noodle dishes, Garden Pea w/ minced pork.  The dish is prepared fairly quickly, granted I was the only customer at the moment.  It soup base & dish for me is considered medium spice level; however they have it classified as spicy.  Which for most would consider it that.  It was good.  

Warning:  Just note that they use the Szechuan Peppercorn (numbing spice), so as you are eating, you will experience that numbing sensation...do not be alarmed (or call 911, you are not experiencing a medical situation), just know that.

All joking aside, it was very flavorful and fills the tummy."}
{"text":"Okay so I had major munchies 4 Chinese food. But I'm very skeptical at trying out Chinese places because I have been let down and food poisoned many times. Well it was 8:20pm I saw this place was down the street but closed at 9pm. So I was also worried about freshness.. But munchies took over . So I called them and put in a order for pick-up. it was ready in 15mins. When i opened it at home OMG! 1st of all huge portions and the taste.. soooo good! I got a order of fried rice w shrimp and a order of chicken chow mein. It was extremely fresh and I am a very satisfied and 4ever customer."}
{"text":"This is a great place for noodles! I love the spicy?don't forget the ice jelly! You will love it."}
{"text":"Xiao Mian means Noodles in Chinese. Chongqing Xiao Mian is the best street food of everyone 's love:)  I am glad that I can find it in the U.S. !!!! Sooo good!  I like No. 40 the Garden pea with minced pork Xiao Mian best of all"}
{"text":"I call in to order take out. I had to talk to three different people to get someone who could communicate English to me and place my order. I asked if they can make a smaller kids order of just white rice and chicken as well as my full entree. They tell me it will be about 20 minutes. I arrive 30 minutes later and food still isn't ready. They give me the bill as two adult entrees. I over pay. I get home and the food isn't even correct I get a fried rice with some chicken and the other full of chewy not fully cooked cashew chicken..not happy and won't return."}
{"text":"The new plates are awesome, the pot and the duck is so good!!!! The staffs are sweet."}
{"text":"This place is really good and let me tell you why!! 

We went with a group, my friend has been here multiple times and she told us that this menu is a new one and she doesn't know if we would like it or not. Sure thing we tried 4 different entrees and let me tell you they were all really good, one of my friend is from China and he said that it felt authentic!"}
{"text":"We ordered noodle and rice dishes. All were SUPER salty. I ordered sweaty spicy level, not disappointing. I eat very spicy. Might try challenging next time. It might be a strategy to order one noodle and then bring home, add some more water and noodle, make them into 2 bowls of noodles."}
{"text":"I hope you will improve and change with your extremely poor service with your alright Chinese food! If you continue with your current ways, I don't think you would make it with all the restaurants out there! P.S. you need to invest more tea pots!"}
{"text":"Wow, I had the #45 Dry Spicy Veggies Xiao Mian advertised as hot and spicy.  Very hot and and great flavor. My first time at this type of noodle place and I know I'll be back for more. Had to let my bowl cool off for about 15 minutes but worth the wait. I'm looking forward to their Tasty BBQ next time . Only the second day opened and I can see they are just going to get better. They will have to earn the 5th star maybe next time. Oh don't forget to try the Magic Ice desert! Wonderful"}
{"text":"I have only been here once but I loved my entree and that of my wife's. I had the Mandarin beef which was excellent and she had the pork intestine which was also very good. I recommend the cuisine highly but the environment is a bit plain but tasteful with Chinese homeland representations... Rob"}
{"text":"What used to be the House of Egg roll is now Let's eat Noodles. My husband had a noodle bowl and I had BBQ chicken wings. Both have amazing favor. A place where many asians also come to eat. That says a lot for the place and the authenticity of the food. We will be back."}
{"text":"I came here Aug 7, 2017 because of rave reviews, and I really liked House of Eggroll (not the name tho, the food).  But for Let's Eat Noodles, I feel the Yelp definition of 2 stars \"Meh, I've experienced better\" is very accurate.  My most salient impression is the same as the reviewer who said the \"food was overpriced, and not enough meat in the noodle bowls\".  We ordered 5 different noodle bowls.  ALL had TINY pieces of meat, like 4 small pieces.  The most tasty was the pork intestine in spicy broth.  Person who ordered the noodles with spare ribs said she only got 4 skinny pieces of spare ribs maybe 1\" long, and the meat was very dry.  Also the total portion in the bowl was not very much.  Big bowl only half full, makes the portion look even smaller.  We also unanimously agreed that we wished our egg that they put in each bowl of noodles had soft yolk instead of kinda hard boiled-like.  

We shared a fried tilapia for $9.95.  It was hardly anything for $9.95, especially fried where you can hardly find the fish meat, and the head takes up 1/3 of the size.  Tilapia was tasty, small, but not tasty enough to come back and order same again.  It was like \"fish jerky\", we said.  

I felt the noodle broth that was not spicy, was \"eh\".  I would have preferred MSG in it to make it taste better, less bland.  I shook salt into the non-spicy broth.  But the pork intestine broth was full-bodied and \"good\".  

My Taiwanese friend said she gets so much more portion and good taste-wise from China Magic Noodle house, for less money $8.50 vs $10 at Let's Eat Noodles.  She was quite dissatisfied with the four short and skinny little pieces of spare rib she got in her soup,

The BBQ skewered appetizers in the glass case are 6 for $4.99 but with so little on each skewer, our opinion was it wasn't worth buying.  

We also shared a Magic Ice jello Dessert.  It was unremarkable, herbal tasting, good for diabetics tho, not too sweet.  

One of my party said he was still hungry, when we were leaving.  But we didn't wanna pay for MORE food when we thought that we were already overpaying for what we got.  

Hardly anyone in the restaurant the entire Monday night.  I hope for them, more business when ASU is in session.  

I give the service 4 stars.  Li was sweet and friendly, told us about the menu, and brought us everything we asked, brought us more water, and they divvy upped the bill so that 4 shared, and 1 had their own bill, without complaint.  The people I ate with said they would rate the food 1 star, but I said Li was at least a 4 star server.  So I am ranking 2 stars.  

When I left the restaurant I told Li we all felt that the noodle bowls had too little meat.   She said \"If you want MORE meat, we have to charge you MORE\".  I said, \"I mean we all felt that we were already paying too much for the amount in the bowl of noodles are are unwilling to pay MORE\".   Li just acknowledged my opinion with a gracious smile.  Food was not terrible, but the 5 of us all agreed it was NOT good enough to come back to.   Poor value.  We talked about how we could get a larger bowl of pho #1 everything in it at most Vietnamese restaurants for $7.50.

   I do look forward to trying \"Shaanxi Garden\" when they open at 67 N Dobson Rd Unit#109 Mesa AZ 85201 in Oct."}
