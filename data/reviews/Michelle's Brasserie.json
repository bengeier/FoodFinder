{"text":"Tucked away in the court yard between Yorkville and Cumberland is Michelle's Brasserie.  One of the things that I have always loved about Yorkville, is all the great little patios and interlocking brick lanes that are still there, even in the face of constant new build.  Michelle's i s un-pretentious with a decently priced menu (I always have the nicoise salad $15 approx) considering, but what's real good is the millions of beers they offer on the menu. Like every single beer ever.  Beer + Great Patio = Heaven"}
{"text":"After a 4-hour train ride from Windsor, this was the perfect little spot to unwind with a cup of French Onion Soup, a burger (from the days when I ate meat), and an ice-cold Diet Coke. The waitstaff was helpful, the decor and ambiance delightful, and the price reasonable. It is nestled in a nice little courtyard boxed in by hotels, restaurants and little shops. I recommend giving this place a try for a nice, quiet lunch."}
{"text":"This place was not prepared for Tiff.  We went to have some drinks on the first Saturday of Tiff around 11:30 in the evening.  By that time the place was dying down a little and was only half full.  It took the waiter 15 minutes to even get over to our table, which he did apologize for.  Michelle's boasts a huge drinks list with almost any brand of hard liquor you could think of.  Again the problem with this was that they RAN OUT OF VODKA!!  They have like 50 types on the menu and all they had left was Absolut.  The waiter explained that the night before Penelope Cruz and her crew drank all the vodka.    I mean really, your restaurant is in Yorkville and its Tiff, you know you're going to need a little extra under the bar than you normally do.  Once we finally ordered our drinks it took another 20 minutes to get them.  Again the place was only half full and there were only five of us who ordered off the drink list, we didn't order anything difficult.  I might give this place another chance in the future because everyone else has rated it so highly, but its going to be a while before I consider it."}
