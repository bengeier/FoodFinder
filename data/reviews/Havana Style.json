{"text":"Great place!!! I am Cuban and I really loved this place! The food is great and generous! Amazing pastelitos! :)"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful surprise in our neighbourhood. Amazing food, ambiance,  music and decor. True, they just opened and may still be learning, but don't hesitate to go to the counter and ask, if you need something. A little piece of Latin flavour in Etobicoke, lots of Spanish being spoken by customers and super nice staff. Highly recommended and will go back soon. Very soon."}
{"text":"Great Cuban sandwiches together with nice atmosphere and friendly service. This is definitely the best Cuban sandwich I have had in Toronto. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I love this place!
I am Cuban and here is where I can have the sandwiches my parents and grandparents told me about in their stories but I never got to try when I lived there.
I think they could speed up things a little with the orders, but I get that a good sandwich takes time to make. 
The food is delicious, and the music is awesome too. You can dance while you are waiting  :)
Great place!"}
{"text":"Beautiful venue which, I understand, can be booked for private functions.

Nice place to meet for lunch and/or bring out of town visitors.

I've never been for dinner, but I have heard other locals recommend it time and time again. 

Great Food. Nice Atmosphere. Cozy & Friendly. 

Owners were attentive and easy to talk to. They are happy to talk about the space, the craftsmanship etc. and show you around."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Cassava fries were great, emapanadas were amazing, tostones were too dry (pretty sure they were microwaved) but with all the grease in the food, they need to get better takeout containers. I brought the food home and the containers were melted and I got sick off the food."}
{"text":"I have one word for this establishment: Infuriating!

Yes, the decor is very nice, the food is good (not great) and the layout fantastic, the service is deplorable to the point I would neither ever go back, nor recommend Havana Style restaurant to any of my friends or family. 

Here's why:

Attempt 1: We showed up at the restaurant for dinner last year and the door was locked. Reason: Private Party! A whole restaurant closed? Odd. 

Attempt 2: We called the next month to make a reservation...Sorry the restaurant is closed for a private party. 

Attempt 3: Please refer to attempt 2

Attempt 4: We secure a reservation and eat...in the middle of someone's private party! I have never, ever felt so much in my life that I was encroaching on someone else's space like I did that night. Party goers were looking at us like, \"Who is this couple, and who invited them?\"
But...the food was good and the decor was cool...so, there was an attempt 5. 

Attempt 5: My girlfriend called the restaurant the day before explaining that she would be bringing her family for a birthday dinner. Fine. No problem. The day of the dinner, she calls the restaurant ON THE WAY THERE just to confirm...Sorry, we can't accommodate you because we are having a private party! What??? My poor girlfriend had to quickly choose another restaurant while apologizing to everyone for the 30 minute drive. She felt embarrassed. 

If this is a private party restaurant, cool...but please post that fact so everyone knows. This is not a show up and dine place, nor is it reliable for securing a table...unless you're Cuban, or unless you know someone...that is my best guess. 

So sad, as there is so much potential here if they could get their act together."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The decor was fabulous and the lady that served me was a sweetheart. I ordered the Cuban and a Cafe Mocha and while it did take quite some time (considering i was the only person in the place) to get both my drink and my food, I was still overly impressed. My sandwich was so good, and even the fries were good. They tasted just like the food I had while i visited Cuba a couple years ago. I will definitely be coming back here since I live within walking distance."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated!!  It feels like being in Cuba.  The food is very good although a little expensive, and the service is a little slow.  I've been there many times as it is close."}
{"text":"Best Cuban food in Etobicoke. Everything is homemade and fresh. I've eaten here a few times and it's always been a 10."}
{"text":"Holy Havana Batman! Cubano eats close to home? Hells to the Ma-friggen-yah! I was trolling around my community facebook group and someone was absolutely raving about this place on Browns line on the Etobicoke/Mississauga border.

For those unfamiliar with Browns-line - it's sort of a forgotten connector road which bridges the 427 to Lakeshore and a lot of times you're still driving at sub-highway speeds and forget to slow down and take a look around - Following the suggestion from a neighbour I decided to explore with purpose.

It might not look like much on the outside but inside the design will have you thinking that you're in a beach bar off resort somewhere in Cuba.

It's as authentic as you can imagine, from the design to the (I'm guessing) husband and wife owners who speak Spanish/Cuban fluently And of course, the food.

While the Cubano sandwich is something popularized in Miami, paired with many of the other menu items you definitely get a well rounded Cuban and Cuban-American cuisine experience.

During my visit, I had a meat empanada to start followed by the signature/popular Cubano sandwich. The empanada was PERFECT, packed with meat, and perfectly cooked. The real game changer with these was the taste of the dough, buttery, flaky and super fresh.

Following the empanada I went with... you guessed it, the classic cubano. Roasted pork, sliced ham, pickles, mustard, and cheese - stuffed into a long panini bun and pressed in a panini press until crunchy on the outside. Wow.

I'm gonna stop there, because I'm getting hungry and it's late at night, go here. Just go here. Now.

{"text":"I also live in the neighbourhood and finally stopped in yesterday for a bite. I ordered a chicken sandwich (can't remember if it was the cuban style or havana style)...regardless, it was delicious! A very unique flavour to it, and it came with crispy fries. I tacked on a pop and the total was less than $10. 

The decor...OMG, I want the exact same tables and chairs/bench in my house! I think I will ask them where they got their furniture next time I'm in ;)"}
{"text":"Odd location but its made up with the fun decor. I had a wonderful iced latte that was quite reasonably priced. There was so much to look at and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"This is a cute little cafe that opened recently in my neighbourhood. I stopped by on a Sunday afternoon with a friend for coffee. The place is nicely decorated. It reminds me of being in Cuba. I believe that the couple working here is Cuban. They have a wide variety of hot beverages. They also have a small menu that carries mainly sandwiches. Another patron ordered a sandwich while I was there and it looked delicious. I will have to return to try the sandwiches. This is such a great addition to Browns Line."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Sandwiches are good. 
If you live really close probably makes sense.
This stretch need more quality food and retail, it's boring."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a night of good rustic atmosphere and delicious Cuban sandwich, then this is the place for you. The service was very good and the food came pretty quickly. Friday nights, they have a dance floor available.  So I think it would be a fun place with some close friends to drink up and dance the night away."}
{"text":"Ok, let me preface this by saying I am Cuban-American and I grew up in Miami, FL., so I've had my fair share of Cuban food. That being said, I have been living in Toronto for the last 5.5 years. I've been to several \"Cuban restaurants\" in Toronto, and none of them come close to providing real Cuban food. 

I moved to Port Credit a couple months back and had to take Browns Line one day because the QEW was backed up for days. On my way home that day, this place \"Havana Style\" caught my eye. My first thought was, oh great, another place trying to pass off overpriced Caribbean fare as Cuban food. So I did some quick googling and saw the pictures on yelp and thought, wait a second... this might be worth a shot. A couple weeks go by, and I had wanted to go, but just never got around to it. Another week passes and then my parents came to visit. On the first day asked me if there was any good Cuban food around, right away I thought what the heck, let's go to this place on browns line.

Anyway long story short, we were all pleasantly surprised. We went for lunch and each of us tried a different sandwich. Dad had the traditional Cuban sandwich, Mom had the Pan con Lechon, and I had the Ropa Vieja sandwich. They were all amazing! The portions were huge by Toronto standards and the price was modest, each sandwich was under $8 and they even came with a side of fries.

Needless to say, I've been back several times and recommend this place to all my friends. I usually go during lunch and only have had the sandwiches. I'll be trying out some of the mains in the near future and update this review with my findings, but so far...

Pros
-Close to home
-Price point is great for great food
-Croquetas are pretty good
-Sandwiches are amazing, Lechon and Ropa Vieja are my favs
-Place is very well decorated 
-They have a party room in the back and host salsa/merengue parties on the weekend.
-owners are super nice
-I hear the mojitos are the best

Cons
-Haven't had a chance to try the mojitos yet
-Sandwiches come out really hot, so you need to wait a couple minutes before biting into the yummy goodness
-they do not have Jupina, Ironbeer, or Materva, so don't ask :(
- they are closed on Monday and Tuesday."}
{"text":"Lot's of potential - if they get their act together!!

Felt like having a Cuban sandwich so I went here. First off it is a nice rustic place to sit interestingly designed. Most people were not eating but having coffee. You feel like you are not really in a restaurant, and by the end of the visit you REALLY feel like you are not in a restaurant. The menu is small: 

4 different sandwiches
1 empanadas
2 type croquettes
fries
1 pita

(Warning sign #1)
We ordered: 2 banana smoothies (only one came out immediately) and 2 sodas. The second banana smoothie came out 1/2 hour later. No exaggeration.

The croquettes came quickly as well and were good, on the menu they were $.75 cents.

(Warning sign #2) 
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE 3 Cuban sandwiches you ask? When you are the first people in the place?? Exactly 1 hour and 10 min!! NO JOKE - I timed it. The sandwiches are simple to make and of the 4 on the menu they are all pretty similar so there shouldn't be a long process to making them. Buns were hard, way too toasted on the top so you have to maneuver them as you eat, being careful not to damage any gum tissue from the sharp bread!

(Warning sign #3)
The croquettes suddenly jumped from $.75 cents to $1.25 each on the bill.
Huh??
 
3 Cubans
3 croquettes
1 order of fries
2 sodas
2 smoothies

= $55 = Too much to be annoyed.

This place won't be around in a year."}
{"text":"3.5-4* stars

Cuban café is a good description for this place!  

Menu consists of 3 parts:  
1)  Apps/Soups/Salads
2)  Sandwiches (~$8)
3)  Mains - which I didn't really look at 'cause they were on the expensive side $~18-22.  I'm sure they're larger in portion.  And there was a paella section which at $22 isn't too-too bad in comparison to other places in the city!

In addition, they also have a coffee/fresh juice (~$4ea) menu.  Not sure if they have their liquor license, as I was never presented with a drink menu, but I saw people drinking beers, they have a bar in which they have bottles of Havana Club behind there.

Prices for the Apps/Sandwiches were quite fair, especially considering the fact that the sandwiches come in a large, pressed baguette.  Felt like only the \"gringos\" ordered the sandwiches and all the Cuban people at the restaurants ordered either stuff from the Apps OR Mains portions of the menu.

The reason why I'm not giving them 4 stars was the fact that it took quite some time for the sandwiches to arrive.  I'd say at least 15-20mins.  So don't expect Subway timing.  Sandwiches were delicious and meats well-marinated, but again, took quite some time to arrive.  So just keep that in mind!

Café Bombon - which was black coffee with condensed milk on the bottom and foam on top was great for anyone who likes their coffee sweet!  Mix well 'cause if you don't, you're in for a sugar attack near the end.  Reminded me of Vietnamese coffee, but not as strong.

There was a group of who I assume were Cuban - and either friends/family of the owner - who were celebrating something, so place did feel very authentic.  

Lady taking the order was very patient and nice though."}
