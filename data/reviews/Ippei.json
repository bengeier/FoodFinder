{"text":"We took our mom out here for Mother's Day lunch and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't crowded.   I agree with the rest that the atmosphere is pleasant and comfortable.   Service:  The food came out a bit haphazardly, with the appetizer coming after the entree and preparation did not seem coordinated.   Food: Chicken lettuce wraps--tasty, good portions, however the sauce was too salty.   Edamame -- good. no real comment or complaint here.   Kobe burger -- meat was  mushy and a bit suspect. Waitress did not ask how we would like it cooked, so it came medium-rare.   Panko shrimp -- only comes with 2 shrimp, so rather small portion.   Pork katsu with curry -- generous portion of pork and rice. Curry was good, but tasted similar to japanese box curry.   fried tempura salmon roll -- 4 large pieces. menu didn't indicate that it came with cream cheese...I wish I knew beforehand. Not totally sold on cream cheese in sushi.   Sushi combo-- 6 pieces of nigiri (yellowtail, salmon, tuna) and 1 california roll. The fish came in generous slices. I found the fish a bit too soft. Sushi on Shea is still the winner for best sushi in my book.   Verdict: I'd go for happy hour when things are a little cheaper. Lunch items are very reasonably priced at $10."}
{"text":"We found Ippei happhazardly through United Airline's dining points program and were instantly hooked.  We now frequent the place at least once or twice a week.  A great atmosphere with a very warm and welcoming host, Michael.  It has all of the ambiance of a very chic place, without the attitude and pompous feel.  The wait staff are all very attentive and pleasant.  The drinks are creative.  And if you're lucky, the owner may join you in a sake bomb, though he insists this is not authentic Japanese tradition.  I'm not a huge sushi person and was mainly brought along by my friends, so I can't comment on all the finer touches on the sushi and whatnot.  I can say, however, that if you ask really nicely you may be able to try a roll that the chefs are working on that is not yet on the menu, including a rib-eye roll that is absolutely delicious and friendly to those of us that shy away from sushi because of the whole raw fish deal.  Prices are very reasonable.  This is an up-and-coming spot that is still fairly quiet, but not for long.  Come now before you have to worry about getting a reservation a week ahead of time.  As it is now, you can just walk in.  Great place to bring a date - low lighting, great service, great food, lots of fun."}
{"text":"So my friends suggested this place called Ippei, right near Scottsdale road and the 101 although in the city limit of Phoenix. I decided to arrange a Sunday night dinner, I hate crowds and loud people.  Needless to say, I was impressed with the place! Dark woods and Contemporary Shamisen and Koto music and bold wall patterns, and mood lighting set the ambience.  They don't hire by race, as some Japanese places do, which was fine, the waitress seemed knowledgeable about the food. Although she didn't explain about the 3 different kitchens they have there. Sushi Bar, Kitchen and the Grill area--Make this place a delight for food conesiuers.  Try the Zucchinni on a stick or other appetizers on a skewer, simply delightful. The sushi was a little expensive but is to be expected, although they put wasabi in the middle of each sushi piece which was a little upsetting.  The food was a little mixed up and came out at different times but that is probably due to server error so I still give this place a 4 star rating.  People don't realize how many things can go wrong in the transfer of food from order to customer.  I give this place a thumbs up and would love to visit again maybe on a late Thursday when no one else goes out."}
{"text":"Ippei is the best Sushi place I have found in Arizona.  The cucumber mint martini has me coming back, time and time again!  The sashimi is outstanding and the sushi chefs have some very creative rolls which I have never tried (Blackjack & Southwest roll).  The dinner menu is much more extensive, and I suggest first-time dinners to come by for dinner. The owner, Michael, is very nice.  When he recognizes you as a regular you will typically end up with something special from the kitchen (his treat).  It is important to mention that Ippei offers an extensive non-fish menu too, which allows you to bring sushi lovers and non-sushi eaters alike to this great establishment.  Do not miss the pot-stickers.  A note on decor: Ippei has a very welcoming modern interior making it an excellent environment to unwind or bring a client."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a new Japanese restaurant to check out, Ippei is it.  It's located in the shopping complex of Scottsdale road and the 101 and it's still new, so it isn't always super packed just yet.  They claim to be the most authentic Japanese dining experience you can have in AZ, and while that's definitely a bold claim to make, they're in luck because I've never been to Japan and won't be able to tell the difference.  Ippei means \"most peaceful\" and I'd say their decor and general ambience follow right along with it.  The lighting is dark- which makes it a nice date place because it sets the 'mood' and dining is semi-private thanks to the partitions that block out other patrons.   If you order sushi, be prepared to pay per piece- something most AZ sushi fans probably aren't used to.  Get the panko-fried vegetables (like tempura)- they're really delish and the katsu shrimp really stood out as well, but you can get that in pork or chicken instead.  Most of the food is shareable and the servers are friendly and knowledgeable.  I will definitely be back!"}
