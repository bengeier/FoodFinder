{"text":"The wait staff was very friendly. The food was just okay, needed some spice, it was bland and my salad had some small wilted pieces of lettuce in it. There is really no theme as far as the decor goes, they have a big dear head hanging behind the cash register that I think is creepy.  The place is filthy! It has not been cleaned for a long time. They have coffee splatters on many of the window blinds and there were dead bugs laying in the window seals, the floor had not been vacuumed are mopped and the wait staff was just standing around. The blinds were so dusty they were fuzzy."}
{"text":"For a homemade meal this is the bomb. Breakfast is a speciality all day long. The veg soup is great just like grandmother made. Service is friendly and you need to ask for Michelle. Great attitude and great service. If you like Liver & Onions gota try it."}
{"text":"The food wasn't anything special, it was just ok. The wait staff was incredibly friendly. Went there just before the lunch rush. The bathrooms are a little worn."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how great the food is here.  I was just passing through and decided to stop.  When I went in, it wasn't busy; it wasn't fancy, and the prices were reasonable so I wasn't expecting too much.  However, the food was the best breakfast I have ever had.  It's even better than my own cooking.   The eggs were fluffy and actually had flavor. I didn't need to add salt or pepper to them which has to be a first for restaurant food.  The french toast was light but filling and the bacon perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Decent food homemade and friendly service.  Probably wouldn't be rushing back, but if it's open you'll get some home-cooked food."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, quick service. Classic diner fare, but that's what we were looking for...comfort food while traveling. The decor and table/seats were worn and dated, but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"A classic in the mid-west.  Good food, great service with a happy staff.  Mom and pop's diner with wholesome american food that is freshly made to order.  Never ending drink refills and hearty portions. Restrooms need renovation and the weeds need to be pulled out front, but the dining room and serving/prep areas are clean. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I grew up down the street from this place. My ma always forbid me going here because people smoked in it (like in the old days!). But one day, I rebelled and I went there. It was the real deal. I live in Los Angeles now, the city that claims to be a sort of Mecca of diners. But what makes a diner a diner is grit and honesty. And good food, of course. None of these fluffy, contrived diners in Hollywood know anything about that. I love the Richfield family diner. It's the real deal. If you're rolling through and have any sense of romance, you gotta check this place out."}
