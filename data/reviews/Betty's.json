{"text":"Nous sommes venu ici pour boire une bière. Finalement, la terrasse étant tellement sympa que nous avons décidé de rester pour dîner. 
Résultat: bouffe de bar très bonne et bon choix de bière. 

Je recommande ! 

Ps: je ne mets pas 5* a cause de la serveuse qui a mis du temps à prendre la commande."}
{"text":"This place is cavernous. So check it: It's 10 pm on a Wednesday night and from the outside the place doesn't seem overly lively, but as we walk in my group of 8 peeps realizes that the place looks pretty packed.

So we ask the bar maid if they can seat all 9 of us, and she says yes. Surprise! Takes us to the other side of a wall and there's actually space.

Food was the main thing we ordered and man those nachos were Grea8t. Also got some samosas and chicken satay skewers. The Samosa sauce was pretty bland (mint & yoghurt raita) but the samosa were nice and tasty (lots of spices, but would register zero on the Scoville scale). The chicken skewers were the bomb.

Oh and next time you go, ask for the corner table with a ledge behind you. Because of winter my group had a lot of stuff with them and if not for that ledge, we wouldn't have been comfortable in the space. Also helped in putting all empties on the ledge cause it was hard for the staff to reach around in the booths.

Reasonable service, and great beer selection."}
{"text":"Came in with my husband after 3 days on the train and a walk from our hotel. Split a great special vegetarian lasagna with salad and garlic bread. Lots of beer on draft...loved the Barking Squirel..."}
{"text":"Completely unimpressed, but not completely out of love. I love dive bars, I really love patios, and I absolutely love food. Lets start with the positive folks, great location, nice environment, large and sun soaked patio. Those reasons alone will bring me back for a redo, maybe taste the nachos, that Blog TO listed among the best in the city. But let me step into the realm of distaste for Bettys, beginning with the food. The french fries look like they have jaundice, and taste like McDonalds french fries on depressants. My chicken wrap was quite disgusting, maybe thats why it was the lunch special. 10 dollars for a couple terrible shoe string fries and a crispy chicken wrap whose contents looked worse than the breaded chicken you would expect at your pathetic elementary school cafeteria. Our waitress was also a lame excuse for a waitress, about as bland as the wrap. I would go back for a beer, MAYBE, since i could roll there from work, but other than that, i will avoid this place with all my might, a 2.5 would serve best, but hey, i put it on a pedestal and was let down, who's fault is that."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in the city!  Great beer selection and friendly staff"}
{"text":"I always enjoy these kinds of places - unpretentious, casual with a good vibe, solid food and a good selection of beer on tap.  The kind of place you can stay all night at with friends.

A fun, casual night"}
{"text":"First of all this is one of the few places in Toronto who have Murphys! Their service  is awesome, when I spilled my beer they gave me a new one without  even charging for it! If you're hungry try their nachos, they are huge! Add to that the good music (mostly good old rock) and it's a wining combination!"}
{"text":"If you want a place with one of the better beer selections in the city go to Bettys! Great place with no attitude and everybody know's  your name...well ok maybe mine.   See you there!"}
{"text":"Had the brunch buffet today.  Lots of selection, from eggs benedict, to belgian waffles, roast beef, ham, pastries, cereal, fresh fruit, salad bar...  It wasn't very busy, but I'm guessing it was because people were away for the long weekend.  Service was fine.  The guy at the carving station was very friendly and helpful.  Sadly, the scrambled eggs tasted powdered and the salad bar seemed a bit wilty.  All in all, I thought it was good for $19.99."}
{"text":"Small TVs. Big wings. Turned off heat during Super Bowl."}
{"text":"Sure it has that cool, hipster vibe...the location is primo for us downtown/St. Lawrence type folks...there are even a few vegan options to accompany that brew and fries...BUT, this is my third time in the past few months and I have NOT been wowed. Service with attitude, Sloooow, boring food and an ambiance that has rested its laurels on
It's hay day decades before."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Betty's for many years now and it has always had a better than expected menu. The patio is awesome and the interior decor is fun, friendly, and entertaining. To top it off I am Dutch and it has long been the unofficial home for us during the World Cup and Euro Championships so I feel extra welcome. But above all of this Betty's has always had the best waitstaff. The ladies who work here are the perfect mix of good at their job and absolutely beautiful. 
Between the quality food, decent bar selections, and superior staff I don't think that there is a better pub in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and unique. Service was wonderful. I'd return to this Toronto landmark anytime."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned one of very few proper bars in Toronto. Excellent beer selection and amazing Cesar's! Attentive servers and great laid back atmosphere... Defo coming back for more drinks!"}
{"text":"I love Betty's, particularly in the summer time.  Their patio is *the* best.  It's all walled in so it's like a giant private party.  There are lovely, massive trees that provide some shade.  The staff here is excellent - fast & friendly.  The food, well, not their strongest point but it's not terrible either.  Go for the drinks, atmosphere & great staff!"}
{"text":"Over all this is a decent bar. The daily food specials are always good. There is a good selection of beers on tap all the usual faves but also a good selection of guest taps thats changed up to keep things fresh. There is a great patio out back that fills up quick on a nice sunny afternoon. If you are heading over and have a big group then i suggest a reservation. There is a bunch of booths that will fit 6 average people almost comfotably. The service can be a little slow if your in a rush i would try and find a spot at the bar but if your not rushed then sit back and relax with a cold one"}
{"text":"I hang out here quite a bit.

I don't agree with some of the other reviewers that describe this as a hang out for George Brown students; I never see anyone who would remind of a student, or at least only the more mature ones hang out here.

The average age of people here seems to be about 35."}
{"text":"This place was within walking distance of the hotel, they served dinner, and they weren't a chain restaurant, so we gave them a try.  It's a dive but I liked it.  We had the kids with us; they ordered chicken nuggets.  I had a veggie curry dish, and my wife had the lasagna.  We liked all of it.  The sangria was good too."}
{"text":"Amazing staff.
Fantastic Food (had nachos and pulled pork poutine).
Great selection of beer.
Speedy service.

What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"A place to get a drink, but that is about it.

Sort of wandered in here on Sunday night after taking in the Christmas Market at the distillery district. Unfortunately, our first choice for food which would have been any of the number of restaurants in the distillery were jammed to the gills. So this was the most convenient place that was actually open. 

I will give Betty's one things, they have a great list of drinks. The food however is mediocre at best and down right bad in some cases. I had the curried lamb, which was very very mediocre. And by mediocre, I mean it wasn't offensive, but I certainly wouldn't try it again. The fish and chips were bad. Everything one the plate was limp. The fries were soggy and the fish was heavy, not crispy and anything but light and flaky. 

I can think of a lot places that have just as good if not better beer selections, with food that is far superior. I would suggest you skip Betty's. I kind of wish I had."}
{"text":"Betty's is just fine for what it is: a dive bar and local watering hole. Their beer selection is pretty great. The food is totally mediocre. I tried the steak and Guinness pie last night, which was pretty bland, but did the job. Their nachos are run-of-the-mill. I've been turned off from ordering the burger since a friend of mine once did and found not one but two hairs in it--bit of a deterrent! 

My softball team used to go here after games sometimes, and in that respect it's totally fine. Group beers yay, dinner nay."}
{"text":"I live above Betty's, so hopefully the food is really solid pub food and it is a decent place to hang out. I guess I don't have to hope, I can go and check it out and let you know. ... Ok, I've checked it out, actually been there maybe a dozen times over the past three years. Lots of beers on tap, so if that's what you want you are good. Guinness and other beers from the island over there are in abundance. There are TVs that show usually sports, but they are visible yet unobtrusive so you don't feel like you are in a sports bar if you don't want to feel like you are in a sports bar. Of course they are tuned to sports, I think that's a by-law. Now food, that is why only three stars. They used to have chicken pot pie on the menu and it was always good. Now it is a special occasionally, and the past three times I've had it, it has been cold in the middle. Burgers are okay, but if you wanted a burger you would have driven to Burger Shoppe on Queen E. But they do let you substitute salad for fries, and they have three choices of salads if that is your thing. There is a deep-six nacho dip appetizer that is good, so I would say stick to beers and appetizers, or else don't care about the food."}
{"text":"Food is good; a decent selection of beers on tap; wine and other drinks also with a fair amount of choice; service is quick and efficient; atmosphere is friendly; conversation flows; patrons are congenial; prices are reasonable; back patio is huge.... it's everything you would want in a pub.  I used to live closeby and stop in regularly.  Now that I live farther away, it's a place good enough to travel to."}
{"text":"A solid effort for the most part.  Went there for lunch today. Tried their special Brazil World Cup burger.  It was juicy and delicious. Plenty of fresh toppings.  The garden salad was ok with mainly iceberg lettuce.  

Service was quick and efficient.  Also a sea of orange around as apparently this is the spot to watch Netherlands play soccer.

TVs are plentiful with good picture quality and sight lines."}
{"text":"Came here for a private party and wasn't sure what to expect as I rarely venture to the east end.  

For a divey bar, it was rather large in size with multiple rooms and a decent size back patio from what I saw.  We were in the upstairs area and what a sight it was.  Decor was very eclectic, literally a mish mash of everything.  The furniture reminded me of an antique shop or someone's kitschy home.  Although not quite homey like, it felt somewhat comforting.  It was a little bit of an eyesore, but also interesting at the same time. 

Also, there were photos and artifacts on the walls of anything and everything, no theme whatsoever.  Seemed like they just hung whatever they had up in no particular order and wherever it may fit. 

The best part of the room was the dumb-waiter.  How many places do you know where you place your orders down a chute?  Quite simple to use as instructions were on the blackboard.  There was a roll of paper provided along with pens on the side table, so we just needed to write our name and orders on a piece of paper, fold it in half, clip it to the zip line, and down the chute it goes.  Wait time between orders were very reasonable and sometimes drinks came up quicker than expected. 

Servers were very friendly and courteous, plus after a couple of orders, they remembered who we were and just brought the drinks right to us without calling our names.  Now that's service!  

Menu was quite varied and very reasonably priced.  Something for everyone and they even have gluten-free menu options and a daily specials menu.  Lots of beers on taps with specials listed on the blackboard.  Definitely a place for beer lovers.

I ordered the rainbow trout ($12.95) which came with salad and rice.  Fish was pan seared with lemon and pepper, tasted fresh and portion was good sized. Nice and simple meal that I finished easily  with nothing left on the plate.

I will have to try the patio for the next visit."}
{"text":"Generally find this a friendly, casual place to grab a drink but the last time I was here with a group of fluctuating size, got total attitude from the server (let's call her \"V\"). She kept rolling her eyes when more friends arrived and wanted to see the menu. They asked her some qs about the food and her snarky response was \"look, I have as much information as you do\". Thanks V, nice that you pick up so much helpful info serving here! 
In any case, won't be rushing back - Betty's isn't as special as she thinks she is!"}
{"text":"Cool ambiance, photos and signage everywhere on the walls.  Our group of 15 had the upstairs reserved on a Saturday night. (No music upstairs, reminded me of a coffee shop set up like \"The Central PerK\" from a Friends episode with vintage style couches and comfy chairs) Our server was not very good spilling drinks.  You can place your order by writing it on a piece of paper and dropping it down this tube that goes to the bar downstairs.   Typical pub style food with ample portions.

I might go here again if it was for a special reason since it is a bit out of the way - east of Sherbourne."}
{"text":"This review is for Betty's Basement (which is actually on the second floor).  This is a great location!  Ideal for 15-40 people, the setup is like an eclectic living room.  We had a school reunion with about 20 of us there.  We had our own server who was quite attentive even as she had to come up the stairs.  But the most brilliant part of Betty's is the system they have for dealing with customers.  Every person had their own billing system set up.  You gave the server your name and every drink was rung up separately so you could have a party and everyone pay their own way however they liked.  It's so brilliant!  Other thing about booking is the ease.  But make sure you call, because they don't answer emails.  Once in the book there are no further obligations.  I'm a fan and would consider more parties there."}
{"text":"Aw the 3.5* rating doesn't do this place justice. Having been here a lot for work and after-work lunches and dinners, I feel like this is a solid place to have a drink in the area - especially if the noisy and touristy Distillery is not your taste.

This is a grungy bar with fantastic service and a terrific beer selection. The food? Well, you're not coming here for it. If you are hungry I have had consistently positive experiences with:
- burger
- poutine
- grilled cheese of the day when they have it
- actually, most things of the day.
- when Kim is here, the pad thai is absolutely worth it.

The team that takes your orders and brings you food is friendly, efficient, they split bills without an issue - really great place to come with a larger group of people, or even just to have a chat.

Definitely on the noisy side.

Get a booth with a tap if you want more privacy (max 4 people)."}
{"text":"Has been a great staple for all the various stages in my life: post exam drinks, birthday hangover breakfast, date drinks, after work drinks, even the odd Reddit meet-up.  The food is okay, but did a great job of accommodating food preferences.  The drink menu is good.
I love the comfort, the space, the patio.  It's a good anytime bar."}
{"text":"Perfect place to call your \"local\".  Casual, accommodating, well-priced, great homemade food, an impressive list of beers on tap, and plenty of room for groups of friends or co-workers.  Nothing fancy, yet everything comfortable."}
{"text":"Upstairs has many interesting books and also there's a fun way to make your orders from upstairs too :) The food was ok but very expensive considering the portion you're getting..we had nachos, grill stuff, and salads and we're still hungry. Downstairs have two sides, one is their dinning area, the other is their bar place. Their washroom is too small for this bar restaurant when it's busy."}
{"text":"Great beer but saltiest poutine on earth. I understand salty bar food pairs well with a cold pint of beer but this was pretty bad. It felt like the chef just dumped  all the salt they had into the gravy. 

Despite the bad food, I would go back for the atmosphere and the beer - maybe it was an off day for the food? Either way,  they have a nice patio out back and a wide variety of drinks."}
{"text":"This is not a destination. 

If you're in the area, by all means, check it out. We do from time to time after volleyball at The Docks. The food is mediocre, they have a nice courtyard in the back, the decor is eclectic and it seems to be busy enough most of the time (a sign of a decent pub). 

I dunno, you can't really go wrong with Betty's, and they do a decent job with a group but don't go out of your way, it's not THAT good."}
{"text":"Really good dive bar. This is the local watering hole for a few of my friends who live in the area. Been here dozens of times and always leave happy! Great beer selection and decent pub grub. Super service and everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"I would givr this 3.5 as well but  ot a 4. This is definitely a dive bar... but it's a cute homey dive bar. Expect nothing and come for drinks and a cozy atmosphere and you'll be happy!"}
{"text":"Packed on a Thursday night for good reason: their namesake beer & burger -- not bad at all. Service was great but not overbearing; definitely has some interesting decor. Good hang out spot. Interested to see what else they have to offer.."}
{"text":"They have very tasty Pizza! Yesterday, I was given a voucher from next door for a free pizza at Betsy's from a restaurant next door. They honoured the voucher and  it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Le Betty's, bar très connu des cols blancs et étudiants du quartier pour sa grand salle au rez de chaussée mais surtout pour son salon privatisable à l'étage.
Un conseil si vous souhaitez réserver la salle à l'étage : il faut appeler le bar puis leur renvoyer un email de confirmation sans ça il ne garderont pas la réservation.
Au niveau du service, si vous venez en groupe l'addition se fera par table donc vueillez à avoir de la monnaie ou bien commandez directement au bar.

//The Betty's, very famous bar is the area where you will see the students and white collar  enjoying a drink after a hard working day. The hidden jewel here is the room upstairs that you can book for private parties.
One advice when you call the bar to book it : you have to send them an email to confirm the booking otherwise they will not keep the room for you.
Staff is quick and friendly but if you come as a group they will put a common bill for each table, so do have change or you can just order straight at the bar."}
{"text":"This is a go to friendly neighbourhood pub/bar for my friends in the area. Not really in my neighbourhood, but when I do join them for a night out here I always have a pretty good time. The food and beer menus are extensive and staff is friendly and fast.
The spicy pulled pork poutine I ordered was not bad. The fries were nothing special and the pork was in no way spicy at all, but, ah well, it's still poutine! Last time I went, my friends ordered an 80 dollar massive nacho dip to share that was pretty impressive. It was a giant tray of guacamole, re-fried beans, sour cream and cheese so thick on top it couldn't be penetrated by nachos, with as many nachos as it took to finish it. Again pretty good, but other than the scale nothing spectacular.
I'm kind of torn, because this place is a regular hang out I'll  give it a 4, but if I'm honest about the food and overall experience (for those that don't have the nostalgia of drunkenly replacing photos on the wall) it's probably a 3. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

Hello Betty... I'm a fan. A nice combination of good food, a solid beer line-up, fast & friendly service and cheap prices.... what else could you ask for?

The GOOD:

- Service was excellent for a \"dive bar\", never had to wait for anything. The minute my glass was empty, I was asked if I wanted another (answered yes every time!).

- Prices are CHEAP for downtown. Huge portion food options were in the $9 - $12 range. However, beer was standard downtown pricing.

- The Betty's Burger was pretty good. Lot's of add on options. I had with pemeal bacon and sauteed mushrooms. Easily one of the BEST \"beer drinking\" establishment burgers. 

- Great BEER selection - About 40 bottled beers, roughly 30 permanent drafts and approximately 10 rotating beers on tap. I enjoyed the Maisel's Dunkel (Dark Weis beer. Good local craft beer options as well. 

- Betty's is for everyone. Broad mix of clients - students, locals, seniors and \"aged between students and senior folks\" like myself.

- The place is HUGE. The wait for tables never really extended beyond 10 minutes on a  busy Friday night from what I could see.

- They also have private party rooms and a cool patio.

and the NOT so GOOD:

- Call me a beer snob but they use the same standard glass for  all beers. Certainly not the end of the world....

- Nachos were average at best (but huge portion and cheap).

I will be back for sure. A great place to hang out with friends in a laid back setting & enjoying some good beer / decent food.

{"text":"This is definitely the closest to an American dive bar work hang out place you can get. I went here with a friend and some of her co workers around 6 to grab some dinner and drinks. The waitresses seem non-chalant and uncaring like most American bars back home. I can't tell if this is the shtick or just because we had a bad waitress. The drinks were fast, and so was the food, but it was just alright. I ordered the half plate nachos (which looks like a full order) and they upcharge for things like chicken, guac and sour cream (hey that's cool) and was totally worth the price. The drinks were average price as well, but definitely provided a huge selection unlike most bars I've seen. The environment you can tell is trying to be ironic with all of their crazy stuff on the walls (like a Fridays in the states) and has a sort of dive bar feel with mis-matched furniture. There isn't much room and everyone is definitely struggling to walk around to get to the bathroom, I was even hit with the bathroom door to my back because of how cramped the place was. Our neighbors table kept slamming into my back as well, due to the space constraints... not sure that's very fire code friendly. Additionally, there were bums pan handling us while we were eating. I have never seen that before. Luckily the, im assuming, manager rushed him out. I heard there was an upstairs but it wasn't the time or place to go exploring. It was super loud and difficult to keep yelling over each other so we decided to split.
I would try this on a brunch day if I lived close to here."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pub in this part of town.  If you're a wing lover, this place is for you.  If you love your nachos, this place is for you as well.  When the food comes out, it comes piping hot.  Careful not to burn the roof of your mouth.

Betty's is the epitome of what a good neighborhood pub should be.  Chill atmosphere, a lot of different kinds of beers, great prices, and walls littered with all kinds of pictures and memorabilia. 

Can't give it 5 stars, because they can improve on the service.  Most of the time it's good, but like other reviewers said, it can be a little slow."}
{"text":"Classic student hub. Home to many gb students needing a to unwind after class or exams. It's not  fancy by any means but it's homey, personal and perfect for a evening of unwinding, gabbing and venting. Not to mention the price is right!"}
{"text":"Betty's deals with a lot of large groups. I tip my hat to the service as its a lot of work trying to get food orders from a table of 20 when half of them are three sheets to the wind. They manage to do it well, though. Someone in our group complained that their quesadilla was too spicy and the server had the kitchen make one that was less so.

This place is probably more your speed if you're a beer drinker. I'm not, so I opted for a vodka soda. It was super weak--even when I asked for a double. Wings were definitely NOT suicide. I gave two of them to other people in our group and they agreed that they were maybe hot at best.

However, Betty's has a great backyard patio and its as decent s place as any to have some beers with a big group.

They're solid, and I'll probably be back if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Usually come here for beers, but met a friend for lunch and I could see why people never talk about their food. I decided to order the special as nothing on the current menu looked interesting. 

I ordered the Milano panini. It was to made of goat cheese, portobello mushrooms, zucchini, eggplant, onions and red peppers. It wasn't a panini at all! It tasted like a cream cheese, the vegetables were not cooked properly, I couldn't taste the portobello at all and the eggplant was chewy! The bread they used was 2 pieces of multigrain toast, not Italian bun as use of the word panini implied. 

Food was a 1 star, the Pilsner Urquel on tap was a 4. Eat someplace else and come here for the beers."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a drink, staff greeted us (8 of is) quickly and effectively. Drinks were cold and reasonably priced. Ended up eating some apps and they were great. Would love to go back!"}
{"text":"The dive of choice for George Brown students. Also, the dive of choice for George Brown teachers. As well, as the nearby office crowd which tend to cluster like bees to honey around the bar, like fermented honey-wheat-bees... if those existed. Plus some other random people.

The place has that \"Je ne sais quoi\" dive feel which is hard to ignore, specially since I have now been there a number of times, mostly (and by mostly, I mean \"ONLY\") after class, after an exam or celebratory final class, as I am currently finishing a social media course at George Brown.

The place also has that hipster vibe with a bunch of photos and posters plastered on most walls at the front, although to be quite honest, I have never paid much attention to them as the tv's on top of the bar displaying numerous sports compete and win for your attention when walking in.

The venue reminds me to an upper-class version of the Red Room -sans books but not as cool nor as smooth as 7-West. Never had food here so I can't comment on that.

I would say Betty's is medium in size which means it can fill out faster than the space would  hint at. There is a good patio which I test drove early in the year; remember those days about a month of so ago when it got all warm all of the sudden? I was there.

Beer is not expensive, however the secret as told by my teacher is to make the last drink you order is a half pint, which, unless you are a jackass to the wait staff, will in fact be more like a 6/7 of a pint. Bonus Points!

But keep it between us okay? *wink* *wink.* Remember to tip well, they will remember you and your pints might get fuller while your bill remains at half-pint speed."}
{"text":"Cool spot! Came here for a church event on the 2nd floor and it's very comfy and homie. Great service and super friendly staff! The food here is pretty good too. Booked my birthday party here so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Originally opened as \"Betty Ford's\" after the clinic founded by the former American First Lady, it has since been renamed, and is a favourite watering hole for students from nearby George Brown College and reporters and media types from the nearby newspaper offices. 

Inexpensive food and a large selection of drafts keep bringing me back. 

The vegetarian poutine is a good idea too."}
{"text":"Heard about the wings so we came here one night to try them.  Super nice server who let me loiter while my friend finished up a test across the street and went long.

Overall, a great experience.  Atmosphere was loud but fun, which goes along with the funky decor.  Service was great - very nice server took care of us all night.  Food was good too and spying other tables, there are a few dishes that look particular good.  Any of the dips looked amazing.  Our wings were great - fried then grilled.  The only miss of our meal was the caesar salad that was rather plain.

Would be happy to come enjoy their atmosphere, service and great food/prices again."}
{"text":"I come here for brunch and they have a very good breakfast poutine.  So addictive.  the breakfast chimichanggas are hefty and yummy and the huevos rangeros are plentiful and delicious.  They serve solid pints early in the morning and this might just be the place wehre it is perfectly acceptable to do so."}
{"text":"My absolutely favourite go to place where my boyfriend and I always come after work. 
He loves the extra crispy hot wings and sends them back if they're not crispy enough. 
My favourite is the double pepperoni pizza. Phenomenal patio in the summertime we always have a good time here"}
{"text":"There is a queen on King St. E. and her name is Betty!

With a FULL, yes FULL! Menu available 7 days a week until 2am Betty's can't be beat.  A popular haunt for an assortment of ne'er do wells, hipsters, artists, writers, musicians, George Brown College students and faculty alike, smattered with the occasional alcoholic and \" Cougar\"-Betty's caters to everyone!

If it's not the selection of 29 draft beers on tap, the speedy unpretentious, yet knowledgeable service, or the ever-present glow of big-screen TV's generously splashing the 'game of the night' or Sportscentre across their screens, then it will be the artery-clogging, meat-sweat inducing, yet unapologetically addicting \"Meat six,\" that will keep you coming back!

At Betty's the menu is as eclectic as the patrons that frequent it, ranging from traditional pub fare such as the standard club sandwich ( known as the Klub Fred), to meaty chicken wings, and nachos to the simply sublime, read the tandoori chicken satays paired with mango dipping sauce, to delicately seasoned pork dumplings.

I haven't even touched on the spacious sun-splashed back patio, which doubles as a utopian urban oasis for those scorching summer afternoons best spent consuming copious amounts of alcohol and eating oneself into a self-induced food coma.  If this is your focus, as it often is mine, then Betty's is where you want to be.

Queen is defined as the female ruler of an independent state, esp. one who inherits the position by right of birth.  Betty's never inherited this designation, no silver-spoon dangled from its privileged mouth at birth.  They have earned all that they have through simply understanding and responding to the needs and wants of their ever thirsty and hungry clientele, day after day, year after year.

A crown is not only reserved for a King, wear your crown proudly Betty, for you have served the people well!"}
{"text":"This place has a cool hipster charm.  No complaints, have come in here a few times, and love the casual-cool atmosphere.  
It definitely has its own charm, its own ambience and can see how the place gets loud....
I ordered a soup, it was average, like a 3 and the food itself was mediocre, like average.  Not great, and not bad. but the beer if flowing, and therefore, i'm totally okay with that.
Bathrooms are a little grimy but I've seen grimier ones....
I dont really have much else to say.."}
{"text":"My new favorite watering hole... so many great beers on tap, excellent service, and some key menu items.

The Samosa are great as well as the tandoori pizza!!  dee-lish"}
{"text":"I only came for beers but my friend had a turkey \"sandwich\" meal. The place is pretty cozy but very loud and tight fitting which I personally don't like. I'll definitely try it again tho since it's close to my school."}
{"text":"Bit loud, but otherwise, a pretty good pub."}
{"text":"This place is certainly a Toronto landmark.  Located in King East, Betty's features cheap drinks and food in a fun and nostalgic atmosphere. They have all kinds of stuff on the wall, including newspaper clippings, pictures, words of wisdom, etc, etc. 

The place is pretty casual as far as the decor and ambiance. Wooden tables and easy going servers make this a fun and relaxing place to go for a quick bite (or a few drinks). I went here with my boyfriend a couple of months ago and I had a smoked salmon wrap type of thing and some couscous salad. It was tasty and inexpensive and they've obviously learnt how to do both of these things extremely well. 

If you're in King East, check out Betty's for a good time."}
{"text":"The family photos and posters give Betty's a friendly, warm vibe. I like that the menus serve different types of foods rather than just your typical, greasy fried chicken wings. Servers were really friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"I really love this place. 

My ONLY complaint is that it's hard to have a conversation with someone (if you don't get here before 9pm). It gets loud with conversations, but that's also a good thing. 

Food: From what I've eaten at this location, I seriously recommend any of the pizzas, nachos, and their mac and cheese (out of this world)!

Drink: Stiegl Radler! They have a top notch/variety of beer selection at a pretty average price.

Decor: Hipster. Their walls are covered in all kinds of art; prints, vintage ads, signs, etc. It's hard to stop looking around.

{"text":"No sir/mam, I don't like it.

A small group of us went (4 to be exact) went out to grab a pint and stumbled into this little place.

I liked the vibe as soon as we got in (think, total dive bar with peeps of all ages and retro hipster 90's jams playing in the background) but I just couldn't get down with the slow service.

I wasn't really paying attention to how long it took for our waitress to take our beer order (it was enough for the rest of the party to make a comment or two) but it definitely took waaaaaaaay too long to bring the bill (20 minutes? For two beers!). The bar was not packed by any means, however they may just not have enough staff on last night to accommodate the patrons who were there. 

Sorry Betty's but I am not a fan. Two stars for atmosphere and divey-ness."}
{"text":"Anytime I've ever gone to Betty's it has been with large groups. It is always busy and loud and the servers tend to disappear. The servers don't come and check on you, so if you want to order food, you better put your whole order in at the beginning, because the next time you see your server will be to pay your bill. Food selection here is good, beer selection is okay. But if I'm going to choose a place for a large group to go and have better service, I'm going to go next door to Pacific Junction Hotel. Sorry, Betty's, you just don't cut it."}
{"text":"This place scores wicked point for being open on Monday. Walking in towards the end of the night for our last drink, we settled into a booth. I noted to patio, but never did make my way out. 

Our server was really fast with serving up our drinks and was attentive but not overbearing. They didn't seem to mind our spontanious photo shoot repeating \"Drunk cute!!!\" over and over while photos were taken. 

Best part was definately the cheap drinks and the local feeling of the place."}
{"text":"This place is your typical neighbourhood dive bar. Cheap beer, decent food, friendly and relaxed atmosphere. Don't expect white linens and amazing service. The waitresses are normally pretty busy, but friendly none the less. Their \"Betty's\" beer is pretty good! As a non beer drinker I like how light it is, usually a good choice when you're splitting a pint. The burgers a delicious too, and the salads that come with them never disappoint (try the spinach!)."}
{"text":"A fun place to get some beer and food! Average food, OK service, and reasonable price.They have brunch buffet (from 11am to 4pm). 

If you are looking for a place for a quick bite (lunch & dinner) or late night snack, or just beer in this neighborhood, you can give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is everything you want a dive bar to be: old, cluttered with cool stuff, awesome beer/food, and an eclectic staff. The name Betty's comes from the previous 'Betty Ford' establishment (see cease and desist photo) which I thought was hilarious. The decor is filled with pictures/posters on every wall and beer taps hanging from the ceiling; too much to absorb/appreciate everything on only one visit. The food was very good pub fare. My wife and I split cajun and extra hot wings along with quesadillas and we washed it down with a sangria (wife said it was very refreshing) and a cask flying monkey smash bomb IPA (awesome). I docked a star because the waitress was very nice but not very good. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I didn't know anything about Betty's.  I was doing this year's Doors Open Toronto and was in the neighbourhood at lunchtime so I stopped in.  What a great place!  Really fun atmosphere with loads of photos, maps and tchotchkes.  Super friendly and efficient service.  Great food, too.  Started with onion rings and they were probably the best onion rings I've ever had.  We had chili and eggs atlantic and both were excellent.  All in all, it was perfect.  I've never given a restaurant a full five stars on Yelp, but Betty deserves it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Lots of beers on tap but at the higher end, price-wise, and only one or two are any good.  It gets worse from there with poor quality food pretty much across the board (even for bar food it's pretty poor) and yes I've been there more times than I should have and seen my mates disappointed with their food (I stopped eating there) but we keep going back as there's very little competition around there.  And the service is usually of the \"I really hate my job\" variety, with the occasional good server thrown in for a nice surprise."}
{"text":"I love pretty much everything about this place. Friendly staff, excellent selection of beer, great vibe in general. 

I haven't eaten there yet but will soon. 

Having just settled into the area I am most certainly going to call this place my local."}
{"text":"I think the service here is only ok, but I'm forced to give them 4 stars, b/c you guessed it - they have fruili!

Undeniably busy - it's an ok spot to hang out.

We had a few apps, which were ok, some fries, and some smothered nacho type thing - meh!  Come for the back patio, and some fruili - for other stuff take a pass, unless you're starving...but everything else tastes better then anyway."}
{"text":"bettys is a fun place with a couple of floors.

upon entering the first floor you hit the bar right away and if youre smart, in the summer, youll keep heading back towards the very spacious fenced in patio.  

upstairs they have improv performances that happen on a consistent basis and are quite fun.

overall i think its a very warm and textured atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best steak and mushroom pie this side of heaven. Perfect service. Great ambiance. Great beverages (superb cider suggestion from the waitress). The suicide wings tasted were, apparently, pretty perfect too. As to the noise level^ Who cares? It's a pub fer Pete's sake. Nice little enclosed terrace in the back. The decor and the friendly service as well as the good quality and well priced food will have us back next time we're in TO."}
{"text":"Great little place to go for a brew and some food (they have Bass beer on tap!). Always a goto place when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Good place to go for drinks but I won't be a regular any time soon. I loved the atmosphere of this bar for my friends birthday party, but there are many other bars in the city with much better food. The prices are cheap, but it's so disappointing. Nothing feels homemade. Don't even bother with dessert."}
{"text":"Came here for a couple of friends with friends.  I was hungry so got the Deep Six dip.  It was okay.  I probably wouldn't get it again, but there were other things on the menu I would try.  

The location is really big, and they have lots of big tables so it would be a great place for a group.  I came on a Friday and while it wasn't packed, it was certainly busy, and had a nice casual atmosphere.  

There are a lot of interesting paintings and decor around the place.  Friendly staff, and while I don't like beer, I can see the large beer selection being very appealing to patrons!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is why it is now called Betty's.  It was formerly the Betty Ford, but a certain rehab clinic in the States fired up their lawyers and before you could utter the words \"cease and desist\", we got a new name.

This place is a great, friendly, nick-knack adorned pub that is brimming with local character and local characters.  A main dining bar at the front, two large dining areas and a secluded patio in the rear have made this place a great venue to go in, have a beer, and chill.  The food is the better of many bars I've been in.  You'd be good to go as simple as the burger or the signature appetizer The Deep Six, a dip that is truly fantastic.

They perform stand-up comedy there every Wednesday in its upstairs room which completely took me by surprise.  Because in the years leading up to their comedy show, I didn't know Betty's had an upstairs.  A good sized space that has a stage, tables and chairs for a show or private party and I never knew it existed.  Must have been more late nights for me there than originally expected.  Oops."}
{"text":"Great place if your in the area, nice and friendly staff and so many options for beer! The food is great too I always get the vegetarian pasta. Great spot, great people and prices and atmosphere"}
{"text":"I LOVE!

So funky, many funny posters.

Food pretty good. Lots of posters.

Cute boys ;) 

Sangria in summer is yummy."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, ever since I moved to Toronto. Best patio ever!"}
{"text":"Three words: Stiegl Grapefruit Radler

Last time I checked, there is no other bar in the whole GTA that has the Stiegl radler on tap. Beyond this glorious imported Austrian delight, which goes down easy on any summer night, their taps are always full of surprises. 

Food-wise, amazing chili, nachos and pulled pork for any occasion - group gatherings, birthdays, game nights or Tuesdays. The fact that they have lots of TV yet doesn't give off the impression of a stodgy sports bar is why Betty is queen of King East. 

Its casual demeanour and totally eclectic setting makes it a bar where suits can co-exist with bike couriers and retirees can laugh with yuppy designers. Some nights service is slow and orders get mixed up, but all is forgiven because there is an unspoken social contract that people sign when they join in for a beer. 

Also, they have hands down the best patio in the neighbourhood. The summer lights really make any night magical."}
{"text":"Noooooo! The breakfast menu is gone! 

Now your options for breakfast/brunch is:

1. All day breakfast for $9.99
2. Brunch buffet for $19.99

I really wanted to make this my spot for weekend mornings but I really miss the huevos rancheros and eggs benny options."}
{"text":"Betty's has always been special. From the interesting characters, to the endless supply of craft beers on tap, to the cease and desist letter from the Betty Ford Centre proudly displayed on the wall, it has a special charm.  

The food is consistent bar type food, with a few interesting twists here and there. The patio is top notch, and it's always happening, no matter the night.

Over the last 7 years I've probably drank hundreds, if not thousands, of pints. Even after all that time, it never gets old and is always a welcome sight on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This bar has awesome character and has apparently been around since 1918 so it has some history. The decor can not be explained and has to be seen with your own eyes. Each booth table has 2 taps with beer you can pour right now at the table. We went here for lunch and I got the wings and had to try the crickets (never had them before) which are also pictured below. The wings I would not recommend again as they were not my liking, the crickets on the other hand tasted bland, but with a little bit of vinegar tasted really good. The texture was like burnt popcorn and you got a good bit of them as you can see. The staff is very friendly and truthful and would definitely go back to try their other food items."}
{"text":"Betty's is a decent drinking hole.  Really good beer selection, decent vibe, decent food, decent service. Yep, you heard me - it's a decent drinking hole.  Also, good location given where I work.  In terms of drinking holes it's the best in the neighborhood compared to all the other places in close walking distance.

But, the best part is, fellow vegetarians - is that they have a yummy vegetarian poutine!  Oh poutine!!!  I missed you sooooo much!  I was so pleased to be re-united with you!  Thank you for giving my butt a reason to expand!  Yay!"}
{"text":"This place I'm in love with! The selection of beverages is astounding. Such a fun place to hang out. All day breakfast is worth it! Also brunch buffets on the weekends is amazing. My new fav place to chill."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place for an afterwork or weekend drink. Great selection of beers. I'm not totally a fan of their menu though and can only comment that their poutine was delicious. I think the last time I was here was for a Jays post season game and it was a good time. Atmosphere was super fun and even made some new friends. Service was as good as it can be."}
{"text":"Betty's has become a local watering hole (and really it's what it is) for George Brown College students at the Sherbourne and King intersection. 
After taking a couple of journalism classes, it became a local for fellow students, teachers and other writerly friends. It's a great place to come with a group. There's large tables, a booth and a lot of historical decor including a notice for the Betty Ford centre. 

The service is quick and consistent. For the most part, it's friendly but sometimes the waitresses have a bad day (and if someone ripped you off, you would too). Jeff, the male waiter, is great. He's always smiling. 

The food is OK. OK as in sometimes their burrito dip is runny; other times, it's cooked. Their wings and nachos are great. But this is a pub, not Canoe so I'm not expecting high end grub. For the most part, we're drinking and they have a variety of brews available (including my trusty Heineken in a bottle). 

I have spotted Project Runway Canada alum here including Shawn Hewson and Evan Biddell. (Surprising!). 

In the summer, there's a large back patio, again, suitable for groups. It's a great alternative to The Distillery District or after walking in the Distillery District."}
{"text":"Kinda love this place for the beer selection, but was bummed out about the service when I went to eat. I had dirty cutlery brought to me twice. Great place to drink. Great vibe, food is average. Got the west platter. Sliders were dry. I feel like I need to end on a high note bc I will be back. Beer is awesome."}
{"text":"It'd been a very long time since I last went to Betty's, but my recent check-in proves that somethings don't change much and that's a good thing. The dive's freely re-clustered tables and relaxed staff (which both work to accommodate large, sometimes unruly groups that I often find myself a part of) make this grungy bar one of the first to come to mind in this somewhat desolate south-eastern part of the city. 

With their walls literally covered in eclectic classic posters, the multiple televisions constantly blaring any and all of \"the\" games of the night, a great selection of beers both on draft and in bottles, and a trusty pub fare menu, Betty's always hits the spot. The \"meat six\" (carnivorous counterpart to the \"deep six\"), an everything dip featuring pulled pork, is served with crunchy corn chips, and is hard to stop eating."}
{"text":"Oh yeah! Fun times happen here!

Great drinks, great staff. Ilove to sit in the back of the room and visit with friends after a long day at work.

I've been coming her since the summer and will alwaysssss return!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a neighborhood bar for a drink after dinner at Mengrai Thai (yum). We found Betty's thanks to your reviews, and it was just what we were hoping to find. It's a cool, old bar with a great, unpretentious vibe, a friendly bartender, and many beers on tap. We sat by the front window and watched the world go by on a Saturday night. Loved it. (5 out of 5 stars because I rate places on what they're trying to be.)"}
{"text":"Just a a down and dirty ol' pub. Great beer selection, reasonable prices and a few signature dishes that are excellent!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars
This is a pretty good bar if you live in the neighbourhood, and the beer list will not disappoint whether you are the international brew-meister or the local microbrew patron sort of guy! That being said, the beers on tap are a little on the pricey side, and you might wait a little while for your drink considering how busy the place can get with locals &/ students.
The atmosphere is something between old school diner and vintage dive bar! The upstairs area is cozy and seems to be available for private functions & the patio in the back is very 'laxed when it is not completely packed! 
Long story short, I can't really think of anything too special to write, but give Betty's a try if you happen to be within a few blocks and are looking for a cold one!"}
{"text":"Ying and Yang assessment here. Before you get the wrong impression while part way through reading this I do recommend Betty's. 

Great patio out back. Never know you are in Toronto.

Lots of beers on tap, 33 I believe, however, they are rarely served in the appropriate glass and never pour it  correctly. If you care, order a standard Canadian draft. They will charge you the same price as an establishment that does pour the beers correctly.

Food is low end pub style food apparently thrown together on the fly, and sometimes with a Cuisinart, if you go by appearance, which is fine.I would recommend the burgers which have a home made taste and texture to them.  Prices are very fair for their food items. 

Staff are usually tattooed and pierced which is OK, however, they can be a little stand-offish, (but not pretentious) with little eye contact,and have no problem walking by a table of empty glasses and thirsty people... Once they know you service is very good.

Having said all that I would still not hesitate to recommend Betty's. Always crowded but rarely do you see anything but good behaviour from other clients. Male, female, straight, gay, in- between, u/k, twenties to seventies, it is an excellent mix. There is very little competition in the area for adults in the area. (The further west you go the younger and louder it is...)."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place back when I worked close by.  I went again last night just to be reminded of the fun times.  It gets very busy after work as people stop in for a drink or 10 after a long day.  The food is pretty good, I'd suggest the klub Fred sandwich.  The fries, poutine and/or nachos are also a treat once you've had 5 pints or so.  In the summer, they have a pretty sweet patio in the back as well, but that also fills fast so arrive early or call to make a reservation."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here for lunches and dinners frequently since he works in the area.

I've always found the food to be delicious. The fries are really good if you enjoy thin cut fries. Everything I've tried here has been quite good. They also have a decent selection of beers, everything at a reasonable price.

The dining area and patio are both great. The patio has lots of plants and shade and inside the dining area has a lot of great decor. Lots if interesting pictures, posters and maps on the walls. 

Betty's is also great for groups and large parties. They have a room upstairs that can be reserved for special events that I've used for several occasions. 

Overall it's a great bar for lunch or dinner. I would have given it 5 stars except that the service can be a little slow sometimes."}
{"text":"Canada has many advantages over the United States. The people are friendlier, there is healthcare for all, every business sells poutine, and their gun ownership and incarceration rates are much lower another certain country that I know.  With all these things going for it, it's surprising that the beer is awful. I'm not just talking about Molson; this also includes the swill their craft breweries create. You would think NAFTA would have been a cure for this, but somehow the only US imports that can be found are things like Budweiser.

Fortunately there is a consulate in Toronto that does it right.  Betty's has a great selection of beer which includes a permanent selection as well as some they rotate. There are even two cask conditioned beers in honor of their British overlords.  They also pour a full pint; too many bars dump beer in your glass and hand it to you with about two inches of beer missing from the widest part of the glass.  You don't have to be a pessimist to see the glass as being 1/5 empty.  

Betty's is my favorite (favourite) bar in Toronto.  It is unquantifiably better than the Distillery shopping mall bars or most places that can be found downtown."}
{"text":"One star for the food. Atmosphere is fun. Our server was friendly. Didn't try the drinks. This is definitely more of a bar than a restaurant. Sadly, we were hungry, not thirsty. My son hated his pizza. My husband hated his beef dip and said it tasted like sawdust. He didn't even touch the second half. My grilled cheese was mediocre and the onion rings were just ok. Overall very disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"It's a dive bar, but it's different than the dives on Ossington. It's more of a dive because of it's simpleness and sometimes less than desirable crowd, not a dive bar because hipsters flock to it to drink PBR.

The place is quite large and there was more than enough seating when the group I was with stumbled in here late one Friday night. The staff were very attentive and had round after round coming just when we needed refills. Prices were reasonable. I paid around $40 for 3 drinks and 3 shots."}
{"text":"This is a good place for Beers and beers. Not a breakfast place. They Tired and given them credit. 

If your hung over and need something to munch on, yeah give it a shot. If you want breakfast food go somewhere else. This is not the place."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have some beers! I love their back patio area and the beer selection. Service is always friendly and food is tasty."}
{"text":"This bar is helping to keep Toronto unique. Betty' s history is humorous as they were formerly known as the Betty Ford Clinic bar, lol. Cease and assist took care of that and now we simply have Betty' s.

Large alcohol and beer selections on hand.  Food is served in LARGE portions. Plenty of seating and friendly bartenders.

Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"If I could give this spot a 3.5, I would, but as it is I will have to go with a 3.  This out-of-the-way bar is probably a popular hang-out spot for locals, and I would probably frequent it a lot if I lived in the area. Our server was friendly and knowledgable, and the other staff that we interacted with were friendly as well.

The atmosphere definitely deserves a 5.  The dive-bar atmosphere just does something for me.  The collection of oddities throughout the whole joint added to the whole ambiance.  I also thought it was cool that the booths in the main area have a pour-your-own option.  If that's not the way you want to go, there are so many different beer and liquor options, including their daily fruit-infused beer.  Unfortunately, on the day we visited they hadn't turned on the infuser, but our waitress was quick to offer suggestions and samples of other beer she thought we might like.

The food, on the other hand, could have been much better.  I know that I shouldn't have expected much, but I was hoping that after reading so many great reviews that it would have been slightly better than your typical pub food.  The french fries were greasy, there wasn't enough cheese on my garlic bread, and the pork dumplings had an odd flavour to them.  

I would likely return to Betty's if I was in this part of the city again, but likely just for drinks."}
{"text":"There's nothing pretentious about Betty's. Not even close. The food is great but simple. The service is good but not schmoozy; servers don't have time to schmooze, they're too busy. The atmosphere is comfortable without trying. 

Betty's is like an old friend who doesn't care what you think about her, but that's why you love her. 

They have a fantastic collection of taps, during the world cup it's so packed you can't move, and in the summer they have a back-door patio that's perfect for long hours in the sun with a pear cider. 

Great hangover food, also. Where else downtown can you get authentic Bangers & Mash? They've been doing things right for so long, right is all they know how to do. Check it out."}
{"text":"Definitely has the \"I don't care, I'm downtown Toronto, I'm too good for you, but we serve good food though our bar looks cold and dreary\" vice to it.

That's kinda basically the epitome of Betty's. Good bands that play there, the nachos are yummy, prices are normal. The food is actually quite good even though the service is not the nicest or most pleasant, but when do you ever go to a bar for service?

May come back again if I'm in the area. Not a big fan, but meh."}
{"text":"I meet up with local (and some not so local) friends on Wednesdays for lunch. If none of the specials grabs me, I'll order a Klub Fred with Caesar salad. Truly the best club sandwich I've found."}
{"text":"A mish-mash of clientele fill out this East End watering hole. It seems to be the venue of choice for after work -- and after class -- as it's packed by 6pm. I can't vouch for the food since I am always inebriated or en route to drunkytown whenever I enter this venue. I think the fries are pretty good though. Blessed is Betty's for being a beacon of booze in an otherwise dry strip (don't even mention Gabby's).

Obligatory Title Pun: You can BET on it.

Menu Readability: Drunkytown. Population: me.

Need to mention: Great patio, but it fills up quickly.

What this place teaches me about myself: Was this place really named after Betty Ford? No wonder I get so zozzled here."}
{"text":"It takes all kinds of people to make this world an interesting place and at any one moment in time you'll be able to see every kind of person at Betty's.  On a recent visit I passed a woman who I believe just arrived from her little house on the prairie, who looked to be reading the bible sitting at the bar beside a man who I believe just arrived from killing someone with his bare hands. But somehow it works.  The beer is cold, the people watching is great and they even have an old sign from Captain John's Seafood out on the back patio!"}
{"text":"I feel bad for whoever visited Betty's tonight as their first impression, because I certainly would never go back after my experience with \"Johnny\" as a server. Not only was he completely uninspired and inattentive, but wholly unapologetic when our food took 40+ minutes to arrive at 10pm on a Saturday. 

This may have been excusable had the restaurant been slammed with customers and understaffed, but neither was true on this visit. Based on this experience I'm bumping Betty's down on my list of places to visit anytime soon. Tonight was actually a one star experience but at least my food portion was ample so I bumped it back to two stars."}
{"text":"Awesome, cosy neighbourhood bar with a great vibe, and good selection of beers on tap.

As a plus, the kitchen is open late and I took advantage after finished a volunteer shift after midnight. The Deep Six texmex dip and nachos hit the spot and were quick.

Loads of lively conversations, attentive staff, a place where bike couriers and tech entrepreneurs can mingle or chill, imbibe and refuel."}
{"text":"My experience here was horrible. Came in after some drinking next door at the pacific junction hotel. 

Burger was charred to a crisp. Black. Can't believe they even plated it. The chicken my friend ordered, inedible. So dry it may as well been labelled jerky on the menu. 

Won't be returning sadly. Looked like a fun place to be, but $45 on two disgusting, inedible meals is enough for me to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Before a jaunt to The Toronto Christmas Market a buddy of mine had to take an hour long work call. If I am to sit for an hour at 6pm, anticipating the pure magic of a ye olden holiday market, I am going to need some alcohol. So, 'twas Betty's we landed on. 

We had poutine, a caesar and some beer. All lovely, and we were especially surprised by the cheesy poutine Delicious. It was a little loud for his work call, which actually delighted me to no end. Go stand outside, nerd. This is a whimsical dive deserving of giggles, chats and cheersing."}
