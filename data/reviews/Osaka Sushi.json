{"text":"I found the sushi way below average. Sashimi does not taste fresh at all and there is too much rice with Sushi. For the spicy salmon, it was literally salmon sushi with two squirts of spicy mayo on top. The sushi was Extremely disappointing  ."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for all you can eat. The sashimi is ok but small pieces. The rolls are not good, too much rice and less sauce but the tempuras are fresh and crispy. Also I like the mango yogurt deserts. Services is good and fast but actually I waited so long for the sashimi but the rest they are pretty fast. Price is good compared to the others."}
{"text":"Just noticed this, why are there two Osaka AYCE restaurant reviews of the same location on yelp... 747 Don Mills... Here was my review on the other yelp page, if it is any helpful at all:  3.5 stars.  Decor nice. Service average. Price reasonable. Food quality, surprisingly, this is where I was surprised. My parents and I were trying to decide where to go around this area, East York, and we saw that Osaka had a 2.5 star review, but only two reviews at the time. My mom wanted to go to Matsuda or Ganoe on Don Mills, south of York Mills, but we had already tried Itamae, which is what Osaka was called before they changed names over the last year or so. I was like \"itamae wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either, but since it changed names and probably owners, you have to give a new place a try and you can't always trust yelp\", especially the 1 star review that my mom had saw, where the user only had 1 review on yelp.  Anyways, kinda got off topic, but we went and our first few items came, tasted good, and was put together well. Our dragon roll and some other special roll came, and the spicy salmon roll... I was not expecting the quality that they provided at this all you can eat. It was better than most a la carte restaurants that we go to, and much better than almost all AYCE sushi restaurants I've been to in Toronto. It was put together so nice, rolled nice and firm, with the perfect amount of rice (not a lot of rice, just enough to hold the roll together!), lots of filling, large amount of seaweed on the spicy salmon, the avocado was perfectly ripe and creamy, it was delicious. The steak was quality, perfectly medium rare pieces with a generous portion of sliced fried garlic with it, the shrimp tempura was as expected, but the yam tempura was HUGE and well done (although, nothing out of the ordinary for the batter they used). I think what really stood out and really makes this place stand out far above most AYCE is the quality of their special rolls and the maki. I can't really begin to describe how surprised I was when I saw it and began eating the rolls we got. The sashimi was good, fresh tasting, a nice size to all their portions, nothing to complain about.  Also read a review about rolls having too much rice, I think, if we got lucky that night and it was a one off, it was our lucky night, but give a \"useful\" approval if you were also surprised about the quality that went into every roll, and the steak... Mmm."}
{"text":"The first time we came here we ordered some tempura and noodles. The tempura was sweet but the noodles was a little bland. I would add another star if they have quicker service. But the food was tasty and you should come. The only bad thing is that while we were eating the noodles, we found a vegetable with a bug in it. The people offered a refund, so the service is friendly (although not quick). We'll come again soon!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some take out from Osaka on New Year's Eve.  Placed the order over the phone and picked up 20 minutes later.  Good was fresh and plentiful.  Prices were reasonable and I enjoyed the food I got.  I would recommend sticking with the sushi.  My husband got curry chicken which wasn't my favourite.  I truly enjoyed the veggie rolls and tempura that I ordered."}
{"text":"PLEASE ASK ABOUT PRICING!   We checked their website thinking it was $17.99 per adult only to realize after 3PM that price jumps to $26.99!   I even asked the waiter why we were billed so much when they had no signs in the restaurant informing the \"luxury price\".  The waiter said he spoke to the owner about this issue but I hardly doubt it.  I'm surprised this restaurant is still surviving given the unexpected bill at the end of the meal.  I have no plans to come back here given my sub-par experience.  Food variety was plenty.  Anything deep fried was good and the fish options were tasty.  Where the disappointment occurred was when we ordered the Chitpole Salmon Sushi.  It was literally one single Pringles chip (chitpole flavoured) paired with fly fish egg and some fake crab meat.  When we received the dish we were confused as the food did not look anywhere near what the displayed food item was.  The sushi chefs cannot wrap sushi rolls properly, they use a cheap seaweed that is very soft and plastic while trying to hide a lot of rice (half of the sushi is rice) and the top meat/vegetable is minimal."}
{"text":"It is a great all you can eat sushi restaurant you might go, ordering itself is fun, we went there with a group of 9 people all loved the soup and the green salad. Also beef teriyaki was awesome, dragon sushi tastes good also it ends with yummy deserts, so for the price you pay, I absolutely recommend it"}
{"text":"Tried all you can eat. Service was good, and the food was okay. Nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"wow fuck the rest of my vacation nothing is living up to this restaurant. this is by far the highest quality all you can eat in all of north america"}
{"text":"I just went to this restaurant and was very disappointed that they did not allow me to get a drink in place of a desert (I'm allergic to a lot of common ingredients),  especially since their drinks are much cheaper! So I just paid regular price for a meal that was *supposed to* include a desert. Osaka Sushi -- customers come first, and are supposed to leave satisfied. Thumbs way down."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to a la Carte sushi place, why might you ask? Because it's absolutely amazing!  I always get one of the bento boxes which comes with a miso soup at the start. If you go here you must try the salmon, as it is very well priced and is very tasty.   Portions are also very generous and give you a lot to the point that I often have trouble finishing my bento box, but then I just shove my leftovers to my boyfriend and he finishes the food for me."}
{"text":"I've been to many Japanese restaurant around East York and North York area, this is the one that we like the most, the way they make their sushi does not fall apart, nice presentation and does not have too much rice.   The price for all you can eat is very seasonable plus lots of variety to choose from their menu, I personally love the desserts,  dragon sushi and fry chicken. Their service was quick and pleasant, I'm highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Was so disappointed in this place. Food was ok however the service was not the greatest. Me and a friend came here with our kids. I have a infant and she has a child under 2. Well when the bill came they charged us for the 2 year old (which is fine he only had 2 chicken wings- but that ok). What was more disturbing was the tip change they put on the bill. When we asked about this they stated it was under new management and they put a mandatory 10 percent change for tip for everyone. This does not make sense because the service was not good and a tip is for good service. Needless to say we will not be coming back to this place as the bill for was over $75.00 and we didn't get drinks. We ended up paying for the bill, however be warned. They will make you tip for bad service. NEVER AGIAN!"}
{"text":"Very great variety and selections, and the ipad makes it so easy to order. The maki rolls are not the greatest, but the sashimi are great (for a buffet)- white tuna, tuna, salmon.... their other dishes are also pretty good for a buffet. Weekday price of $25, w-e for $27. standard for ayce i guess. Overall still worth it. Great customer service too. My bf always loves coming here for the value and for the variety."}
{"text":"Fast and good service, and great food. My family and I enjoy coming here because we love sushi. Most importantly, the kids love it here especially the desserts. I feel the washrooms are a little dark and maybe should be cleaned up more on a rotation. But all else, love it! Everytime we ask the kids where they want to eat...this is the place they ask for."}
{"text":"Rude lady, she took my order today. 12:03pm. March 8, 2018."}
{"text":"Bad costumer service. We waited for our food to get serve for so long. The staff its self not serving us properly. I don't think Ill visit this place again . My family is very disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing! The entire restaurant experience was great from start to end. Ordering from iPads definitely gives customers a customizeable experience. However, I recommend that you order a large sum of food  so that you don't have to keep ordering and waiting.  There's a variety of Chinese/Japanese food, sushi, desserts, etc. Even if you dislike sushi, they have other options ranging from salad, soup (ramen), appetizers, noodles, meat dishes, etc. The sushi is average, but the variety of rolls is what makes this restaurant unique.  I highly recommend you try the sashimi (dinner), dim sum (especially the Siu Mai, and Xiao Long Bao), cutlets, ramen (both fried and soup), karaage, and a whole bunch more. Also, I recommend trying a whole bunch of desserts (can't really name a whole bunch because they're all good).   The decor is pretty ambient and modern. It would be a nice place for a social gathering or a family/couples' night out."}
{"text":"Terrible food.  Terrible service.  Customers kids running around all over the place and no-one says anything (I might as well eat at McDonalds).  The vegetarian bento box was unedible, and I had to fight with management to take it off the bill (their excuse - you ate the soup). There are many other sushi places around, so stay away from this place."}
{"text":"like many of you said..super shitty service...there is no service other than bring ur food...which is pretty fast...all the waiters seems retarded! they offer free wifi which at 1st didnt work, so I asked our waitress to help me...and she told me maybe there are too many people using it...I was like r u kidding me...look around, there are only three tables...how can there too many people using it?  she said came back and said there r many staff using the wifi...i was like, well tell them to get off the wifi...so a paying customer can use it...and of course she never came back and stopped serving my table...after getting someone else to reset the wifi...I find the waiter and waitress r super cold...they dont talk to u, they dont ask if u enjoy their food...nor do they care if u need service at all...and the \"call of service\" button on their ipad system dont work all the time...and This is on a slow night with only a few tables...TO RESTAURANT OWNER: Please train ur staff!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.   The food comes in small delicious dishes and they are tastier than you'd expect from a. Buffet.  The sashimi is incredibly fresh, and rivals any financial district lunch shushi.  I was also surprised how delicious the steak and fried chicken was.   Highly recommended for families or foodies.   It does have the classic buffet atmosphere, so if it's date night, might not be the best place, but the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for great AYCE Sushi and so I like to give new places a try.  I've now actually been to Osaka a couple of times and I don't think I'm going to bother ever again. It's not that Osaka is terrible, the food is fine, but it's super average to be honest. I can think of at least three or more places that are better so I'm left wondering why I would bother coming here again.   If you're in the area and you're hard pressed to want to find another place then you'll be ok here but if you're on the hunt for good AYCE Sushi, go looking elsewhere. You'll find a number of very good reviews for other places in my list."}
{"text":"It's fast. The food is pretty decent. It's an area without a ton of really strong competition. This is  not likely to be very many people's favourite restaurant, but if you want a varied all-you-can-eat meal in this area, you pretty much have to pick between this and the Mongolian Grill up the street, and if you want AYCE sushi, it's here.  We've been here five or ten times from a nearby office, and it's fairly consistently decent. I'm never going to recommend it strongly to anyone, but we've been here before and we'll go here again."}
{"text":"Our main work lunch venue- favourite is spicy salmon!  Also love the steak, spicy ramen, chicken skewers... Desserts- tiramisu, blueberry yogurt are great too!"}
{"text":"Third time here and everytime I leave saying \"it's not that great\" but why do I keep coming back, simply convenience. Be sure to bring cash, if you pay with cash you get 10% off the entire bill. dont fill up on rolls, it's a lot of rice and not worth it. service is quick which is what I love! food is mediocre: - jumbo shrimp is not jumbo lol  - the short ribs are great - the beef tataki is super good but they always bring you less than what u order..i swear we had to order it 10x - cheese wonton is no good, old oil  - flounder is good, lots of bones though - miso soup is super sweet... - seaweed salad is good - mango yogurt is really good - chocolate mousse is not good, bitter - salmon sashimi is super tiny cuts, order lots - eel sushi is good, but I love eel so id eat anything eel, bad or good lol  - fried squid tentscles is not crispy  - zucchini no good - mushroom rolled in beef, super chewy - fried dumplings is okay, cant really screw that up  All in all, it's not a bad place for ayce at 24$ per person for dinner. The food is okay, depends what you eat. dont bother with rolls, or those rice/noodle dishes. you wont get your moneys worth. Stick with the sashimi, and tataki. the service is always quick."}
{"text":"Best quality of sashimi for the price. Delicious tataki and takoyaki skewers. Yummy dessrt. Love this place. Franco is my favorite waiter!!!"}
{"text":"ive been to a lot of sushi places in my life and this is my second time coming to this all you can eat buffet.  to be honest its quite good.  the food is excellent, its modern the method of ordering is fantastic (through ipod) so id say uts up to date and on par with the times.  the flavour and the quality of food is delicious and theres such a variety on the menu that are less generic than other japanese restaurants including an amazing menu with your favourite items as well.  the avacado especially was on point.  creamy actually and so yummy  and to top it off the servers were very friendly and even smiling!  id give this place a 4.5 overall because the staff seemed very nice.  the only con would be that the food took a bit but still overall fast.  inreally hope this place stays a long time as it seems to be a reputable gem."}
{"text":"Went here for AYCE lunch. Beef teriyaki and garlic sirloin cubes were full of fatty parts. Selection of maki rolls wasn't the greatest. Most of them came with a lot of rice to fill you up. Service isn't the greatest and sometimes they throttle your food and serve you mountains of plates near the end so you pay fees for not finishing everything."}
{"text":"I've only been to Osaka a few times, as I'm slowly getting used to this food.  Honestly, top notch quality here!!  I'm not TOO familiar with everything I was eating, but it was so delicious!!  Even when busy, they're very fast to have you seated and served.  The staff is always friendly, the vibe is great, and you leave feeling FULL - but not gross.  Very affordable and worth every bite!  I've been to a couple other sushi places, but this one takes the cake!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed time with my family on my hubby's birthday. Very good food and kindly staff. Not too salty not too sweet. I love this place. Birthday person 50% off wow!!! Definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pork katsu bento ($8.99) - eat in. It came with miso soup, 4 deep fried dumplings, a pile of shredded cabbage topped with sweet hot sauce and mayo, a huge scoop of purple rice, and a good amount of pork katsu. The rice was tender. The katsu was crispy and the breading wasn't too thick. The pork inside wasn't dry. What I really like is that they topped it with a mayo based sauce instead of the typical worchestershire/thickened ketchup sauce. I find that that sauce usually hides the taste of my pork katsu. The mayo just makes everything better. It's a very good portion of food for $8.99 and I'd be more than willing to get this again. We hit a bit of a snag with the service (I gave the girl at the register the English name of the menu item and also the item number, and she got it wrong), but when I asked her for an extra pair of chopsticks and a bowl, she gave them to me with a smile. When I returned again to ask for a cup of water, she gave that to me with a smile as well.   Grandma and grandpa liked it too. Actually, grandma ate quite a bit. That's always a plus. So did grandpa...   Just an FYI, there's actually two menu items with pork katsu in them. They're the same price. This one is the bento, and it comes with more variety in terms of food items (I'm assuming). The other one is a pork katsu with rice. I don't know whether that comes with side dishes or more pork or whatever, but from the picture, it looks like pork katsu, rice, and perhaps the shredded cabbage. I'm into variety, so the bento is my choice."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff who were still polite to us even though our table was one of the last few customers left at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Service: 4/5  This place was amazing. Their food was top notch. Almost everything we ordered was delicious. The service could have been quicker but I was generally happy with it. The only downside would be the location. Seemed a little sketch with cops driving around and kids asking to bum a cigarette outside, but once you're in the restaurant it's beautiful."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Read mixed reviews about this place, but I liked it. I give it a 3.5 stars.  The decor was modern. The place was huge and very clean. I like the iPad system with ordering food. Service was quick. Got the food right away! Calling for service was slow though. Waited awhile to get a top up on my water and the bill.  Lots of variety of food ranging from sushi, dim sum, ramen, udon, fried rice, grilled and fried food, Mongolian dishes, Chinese dishes, and dessert. Didn't even try everything on the menu!  The dim sum was surprising good. The sashimi was cut very small, but quality was good. The grill food was ok. Some hits and misses. I liked the tempura pumpkin and beef ribs. I also liked some of the unique food like salmon sashimi on a pringle chip and the baked cheese mussel. I didn't like the mango salad (too much lime) and beef enoki (too tough).   Tip: bring cash to save 10%!"}
{"text":"OK, AYCE Toronto, Strike II. Chop up the imitation krab already!!! Nobody wants to eat that garbage whole, in chunks or undressed...Lazy!  Do not be romanced by what the presentation dishes are on the ipad menu. When it hits your table you won't recognize it, barebones swill all the way.  Prawn tempura (it is not) comes out looking like pale chopsticks with ceiling insulation stuck to them.  Seriously, this stupid iPad menu is running a BS slideshow of all the awesome looking food that is apparently made here. The trash delivered to my table looks nothing like it.  Beware of roaming hyper infants running all over the place while you are eating. Parents I guess treat the place like a chucky cheese and the wait staff look the other way.  So yea, come here if you have $22  for dinner and want to stuff yourself with seafood an alley cat wouldn't touch."}
{"text":"Once you get over the fact that it's simply fast food, your experience would probably be as decent as mine.  I wanted a quick lunch earlier today since I had an important errand I had to run at the other side of town in 90 minutes. The Galleria food court was definitely not the first place I had in mind, but seeing how this food court traditionally is quick in their orders (at least from the old Galleria), I decided to have lunch here.  My choices were either the seafood udon or the miso ramyun. I went for the $7.99 miso ramyun, and to be honest the \"ramyun\" was more \"ramen\" (ramyun is much thicker), but for fast food quality it certainly isn't anything terrible. The miso soup didn't really taste like miso soup, but simply that MSG + salty nature. Again, I sort of expected that and looked beyond it. Personally I probably should've gone for the seafood udon, as the old Galleria Supermarket did it quite well.  It certainly isn't a place to take your first date, and certainly not a place if you want good quality food, but if you want fast, dirt-cheap Japanese or Korean food, by all means this fits the cake.  Fun fact: There is also an Osaka Sushi in Markham on Highway 7 near Markham Road. They do not appear to be the same owner."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi. Tend to avoid these as they can't compare to a la carts however this establishment was surprisingly quite good. Ordering is via iPad which is great. No hassle of having to read out to a waiter and risk having the wrong item ordered. As typical with most ayce places, they never get your quantities right despite the iPad being used. Sushi is average as expected but everything else was quite good. The steak bites were awesome.  Seating is spread out enough to not feel squished."}
{"text":"Service is very slow on Saturday night. The food is ok otherwise if you have the patience to wait. Constant missed orders."}
{"text":"Fresh sashimi and sushis  Ipad orders good sushi place in northyork Their service was lovely as an ayce they try to place their sushi in fancy boats that was a great experience  Their service is fast and friendly  You get 10% if you pay in cash!"}
{"text":"We always drove by this restaurant and it never looked busy. One day I turned to my boyfriend and said \" I want to go to that restaurant maybe it could be good \"  So we did ACYE. The sashimi was fresh and the portion sizes of the rolls were consistent. As my boyfriend doesn't eat the raw fish he is the one to try the cooked options. The mussels were delicious, and everything else had good flavours.  It wasn't outstanding but it was good enough for us to want to go back again. Every time we do go back I am not disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for an after eat meal after softball. Service was fast and food was good. The sashimi was good for the all you can eat deal. Came here with an empty stomach and left with a sushi baby. The location is convenient and the external is noticeable. There was lots of variety in fish, rolls, mains and dessert. Ordering is done thru an iPad which the concept was adopted from other sushi restos I've been before. Price for all you can eat is decent given the GTA location.   Overall a good place for ACYE and price point.   The location was clean, bright and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Quality ingredients, highly experienced preparation and excellent service.  Traveled from Texas, to visit my parents, and was promptly invited to join them at their new favorite restaurant. Our lunch was superb from the grilled options to tempura and of course the sushi! We had a good variety and I'd say this is the best I've had through the years. To top it off their specials are a great value!  The location is in a small shopping center, but don't let that fool you. The atmosphere was relaxing. The decor modern. And overall exceptionally clean. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting.  I went on a weekday at lunch (1:30pm)and it was pack! They had the iPad to order from, and service here is great! I ask one of the staff if I could get no avocado in one of my rolls, and it was no problem for them. The food here taste fresh, I love the meats that they had to offer here. Overall, great sushi, great service, the food came out fast and hot. Better ayce sushi in the area."}
{"text":"A very good friend of mine was visiting Toronto from out of town and he was dying to have Sushi. We really only selected this place due to convenience as it was only 5 minutes from where he was staying. I was familiar with this restaurant because I had been there many times when it was run under a different banner, and presumably different management as well.  We hadn't opted for the AYCE, instead decided to go straight off of the a la carte menu.  We had ordered tempura yam, edamame, spicy crispy salmon, green dragon rolls, spicy tuna rolls, and salmon sashimi.  The Good:    - Edamame seemed to be cooked well enough, not overly salted  - Tempura yam was cooked crisp and served piping hot  The Bad: -Crispy spicy salmon rolls had far too much tempura bits wrapped into it, and not enough salmon or spicy mayo.  At one point I used the chopstick to probe into the roll and to my disappointment noticed that over half of the contents of the roll had just been tempura bits.  When eating the rolls it was so dry that i felt the need to take a sip of water or tea to clear my throat -Green dragon looked aesthetically appealing but when we had attempted to pick them, they would unravel and fall apart.  The taste was no more than average but the avocado itself was extremely hard and it would throw off the texture while chewing  Both my friend and I were disappointed with the experience and i found myself having to explain that \"it used to be a lot better\".  In any case, I will likely not be returning to this establishment.  The one saving grace is that service was actually exceptional.  very polite and expedient.  For that I bestow a score of \"Meh, I've experienced better\""}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get sushi! The quality is always good and the food is always prepared fast. The staff are very friendly and hospitable. I bring all my sushi friends to this place and they love it. Shout out to CoCo!"}
{"text":"Me eyeing the selection of maki roll of Osaka Sushi..... prices starting from $5.99 for a California Roll..   Not like it is the great deal.. since Osaka Sushi is just one of those places inside the Galleria food court... and eating at food court you expect dirt cheap prices.  Black Dragon Roll ($8.84) - BBQ eel over California Roll - that is almost the price what I paid for a sushi lunch specials at the Ichiban down the road... - mmmm, yummmmm... I just love eel...especially when every piece of the roll has this huge piece of eel on top... - The shari rice for the roll was surprising good.. with a good balance of vinger and excellent bite to it - The only complain is just there were too much sauce and it kind of cover the taste of tobiko  eel.. how I love eel.........."}
{"text":"The food you order does not match the photos from the ipad ordering system and the cheese wonton is basically all fried dough and no cheese. They also take forever to deliver the food."}
{"text":"I had low expectation coming to this place, but it was surprisingly nice. I really like the spacious seating and not too busy/loud during weekend lunch , so it is good to bring kids. Even though the choices of food are limited , but good enough for the Japanese AYCE. Will definitely going back if I want to have a comfortable place to eat a meal."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this restaurant when they first opened. It was called Itamae before. The food was really good but I feel like ever since they changed the name, staff, food everything went down hill.  A couple of weeks ago I decided to bring my cousins here for lunch. Everything was fine until the bill came. All 3 of us split the bill, and I noticed that there was a charge of $4.99 on my bill. When I asked the server what the $4.99 was, he told me it's because my daughter ate. I told him that my daughter is not even 1 year old, she is only 9 Months, why am I getting charged $5 dollars for it? His response was because \"she ate\". My daughter can't even eat a lot, she had a little bit of rice and small pieces of salmon teriyaki. Still the server was still arguing that I had to pay because she ate. I told him, most restaurants ONLY charge $2.99 for children who are 2 years and older. Which I can understand, because at that age, most children can properly eat, but $4.99..... for not even eating half of a bowl of rice, that's just ridiculous! So, ended up paying because the server refused to take it out my bill. Never ever going back to this place!"}
{"text":"What!  No sashimi in an all you can eat japanese restaurant?!  Oh but they have practically everything else though.  A favourite was beef teriyaki - tender and tasty.  And their desserts were a huge hit!  Chocolate ice cream was reordered many times.  And for the first time i tried fried milk.  My brain still can't wrap around the concept of fried milk... and i honestly still don't know how to describe it.  But it was a good experience.  Lol.  Does this even make sense?! The service was ok.  They made mistakes with bringing out the wrong orders, and sometimes not bringing out the ones i requested.  And oh, we had to go to find spoons for our desserts.  But the staff did try their best."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi spot in my area. Most of them are comparable, with the same features, decor and quality of sushi, but this one stands out JUST above the others.   I have come here on several occasions and the food has always been fresh and the hot dishes always come out hot.   The service is good and quick & from personal experience we ALWAYS get everything that we order during AYCE.   The price is pretty much ball park to all the other AYCE places in the area, but again the quality is what keeps me coming back!   Highly suggest making a reso before hand on Fridays and Saturday's!"}
{"text":"Yo. Don't know why the reviews are so low here. My family and I enjoy coming here every time. The delivery is fast, the selection is wide and while the quality isn't off the charts there are some elements that are surprisingly good.   No complaints.   Great food.   Good times."}
