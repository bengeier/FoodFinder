{"text":"What a great addition to the neighbourhood, some really delicious Aburi. The staff is friendly and attentive, making sure you are familiar and comfortable with the menu. The atmosphere is intimate and calm, and definitely has a special event, date night feel to it. Tucked away just around the corner from Yonge, take the time to find this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We visited for lunch on a weekday. I would echo that the decor and presentation of the food was really nice (as seen in pics), but unfortunately the food was very underwhelming. We had the Otoro sushi which was decent but very overpriced at $14 a piece. we also had the aburi premium, which had a few pieces that tasted kind of fishy and not fresh. When I say fishy, I don't mean the pleasant taste of sashimi, I mean the smell of fish that is left out for too long. We also had the salmon oishi sushi, which was tasty but overwhelmingly oily and heavy and you can only have 2-3 piece at most. The smoked chirashi tart is presented beautifully, but the fish was also fishy and clearly not fresh, and there was even a fish bone in it. Overall, beautiful place and presentation, but unfortunately the freshness and quality is quite lacking."}
{"text":"This place offers high quality Aburi and pressed sushi at very affordable prices. The taste of the food is basically as good as fancy restaurants like Miku but it's at take out food kind of price range. The take out box was very well made and has instructions on which sauce to use and what order to eat the sushi on the box. I really liked it."}
{"text":"I couldn't really decide whether this place is a 4 star for small eaters like me or 3 stars because my friends left hungry.... So I'm going with pleasing the masses. 

There's enough green P paring nearby, on the east side of Yonge, convenient enough. 

Our party of 8 arrived and they escoeted us to the back section where there was a bit of a secluded nook. And that was a really good choice because we were oh-so loud. Sorry Aburi Room. I really enjoyed the privacy and it's great for birthday celebeation, which was exactly why we were there. 

We all went with the $52 omakase. Appetizers were a little boring. It was picked cabbage, I think, edamame, and two pieces of salmon sashimi. Lack luster. I would  have preferred maybed a miso soup to sub with one of the appetizers. 

The sushi was fresh and a pleasant surprise for the price. However, most of my friends finished the meal hungry since it's only 12 pieces of sushi. But I enjoyed the pairings between fish and garnish. 

Service was also very attentive. They were very on top of the tea refills and promptly asked us if we wanted our cake after the meal."}
{"text":"Came here April 21 on this first beautiful spring day after long months of winter and snow storms. Place is small but comfortable, clean looking cozzy. Have to wait for more than 1 hour cause the reception scew up with the other guy's reservations and we are also affected. Menu is simple straight forward, i find their tasting menu is too small. I saw that they have takeout so i tried to order but they wont it for dine ins. Food good quality but they are stingy in serving wasabi, i have to ask for one. Place is too pricey with limited menu. Service not good i have been to better and more expensive sushi places around the area. I wont be coming back, however its an experience. I can get the same good quality sushi anywhere and not go hungry."}
{"text":"I stumbled on Aburi Room via instagram.  I love torched and pressed sushi so I definitely wanted to try.  I called about two days before for a Friday night reservation.  We sat in the back room.  We tried the plate omakase.  The first three pieces they brought out were delicious.  I don't even remember what kind of fish they were but they were really good and all aburi style.  Next was a beautiful plate of sushi, these weren't torched but they were still delicious.  The scallops and fatty tuna stood out.  I would have liked more torched pressed pieces in the omakase.  But all in all everything was very good and fresh.  Like other helpers mentioned, the edamame to start is rather bland.  Needs a bit of salt or something.  We also had a delicious sale.  Service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Great korean and japanese fusion sushi! Definitely worth a try! Went there twice and have not disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I have a whole lot to say about this place, I was sort of down on the concept of an omakase consisting of entirely aburi sushi and the price I figured was too good to be true for something that was going to excite my palate. The food was fine with hints of something good but mostly misses to middle-of-the-pack dishes. 

My opinions are that I have had better aburi sushi else where (Miku for example) and even more have had better omakases that featured some but not entirely of aburi sushi. 

The gimmick of Aburi House is their use of charcoal wood to torch their sushi. I think the smokiness definitely comes through but it didn't really save any of the pieces in my opinion. 

Anyways we got the premium set (which is what I'm sticking to naming it because as my partner and I discussed omakase is leave it to the chef, and often feature the freshest catch or a catered chef selection experience, which this cannot ever be because of the set item and menu style). There were just three really big issues for me: the level of saltiness to one to the pieces, the sweetness in another, and the weird combination in another that gave me the feel of like a canned smoke oyster but much much milder. Rice was mushy but also didn't really hold up except for the ones they had pressed more rectangularly. The hand rolls were equally problematic as I had looked forward to the crab one and it under delivered. It had a salty fishy taste and did not have any of the slightly sweet taste that crab meat should have. Honestly it was quite difficult to get down, had t not been for my resolve to not waste food. 

The service was neglectful as they put our group in a back room alcove where the washrooms and staff only room was next too. There was a wall of mirrors reminiscent of a bridal dress shop. The decor was plain and minimalistic except for the wall of mirrors. One of our dining companions got the aburi platter and seemed to enjoy himself so I'm inclined to think that you need to pay for flavour. 

I don't want to just shit on this restaurant. Their concept being broken as a omakase to-go (shivers). I get the approachability but Just NO!!
The fish here is good to really good quality and the tai (snapper sushi non-aburi style) I ordered to cheer myself up at the end of the meal was a real highlight. This was the thing that was the saving grace and if you have more money come and try their a la carte for what I would imagine is their best experience. Do not get omakase to go you or you will be disappointed. Unless you've never had it before start here and your experiences can only go up after you go have REAL omakase."}
{"text":"Absolutely splendid! Service was friendly, space was well furnished and the interior design was adorable and cozy! But most importantly, the food was amazing, fresh and scrumptiously melted in my mouth. You don't even need soy sauce because the flavours are so well balanced and very savoury in its own! The space is divided into two dining sections and you can see the chefs are at work on their masterpieces. Since the space isn't too big, the servers can definitely spot you quickly and assist you whenever you need something. Only downfall is that they didn't come to check up on us during the meal and offered a refill for my tea once we got our bill. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this delightful place for sushi!"}
{"text":"The Aburi Room is a new sushi spot that's opened up in the Willowdale area.  I visited Aburi on a Tuesday evening and was really taken aback by the lovely decor. I'll echo the other reviews in describing it as aesthetically pleasing. There is a lovely green vine wall in the front area, and vines hanging from the ceiling. The meal starts off the green tea for the party and then you can chose from a few omakase options. There's also a la carte menu options if that's more your style. 

A majority of our group went with the Aburi premium tasting menu. The meal starts with edamame and sashimi tartare. Sadly, our edamame was very undercooked. I had trouble getting those delicious little green soy beans out and I was not pleased. Thankfully, what came next completely changed my mood. Ten delicious pieces of sushi and oshi just waiting to be eaten. Each one tasting better than the next. I distinctly remember a feeling of sadness wash over me as I devoured the last one. I had a few favourites but seriously I could (and would) eat them all again. 

The last part of the meal was the blue crab and spicy salmon roll. Both I could have done without to be honest. The crab itself was delicious but the seaweed they used completely overpowered the taste. The spicy sauce used with the salmon just had a odd flavour to me. So unfortunately, the meal didn't end on the high note I thought it would but I certainly thought about that sushi in the days following. 

I think it's a nice experience and a lovely space so I would recommend you try it at least once.  If I return I'd probably go a la carte."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of girlfriends to celebrate a birthday. We had a party of 6 and were seated at the back of the restaurant. The environment was very inviting and chic with lots of greenery. It's a perfect place for a girl's night out or a date night. The staffs were friendly and attentive. Our server went above and beyond to help us take a group photo and was attentive throughout the night.

The Omakase (chef's choice) tasting menu came with 3 options, Lite ($22), Premium ($32) and The Aburi Plate ($52). The Premium set comes with edamame and sashimi tartare to start, 10 assorted aburi style (flame seared) sushi + oshi (pressed) sushi and 2 pieces of hand rolls. The fishes were fresh and tender. The flavours were wonderfully combined. And all of the dishes were presented beautifully like a piece of art. For example, the chirashi tart consisted of  various fresh fishes in a tower form and smoked inside a glass dome on our table.  The only disappointment here was the hand rolls. They were a bit underwhelming compared with all other items I tried that night. I felt full at the end of the meal but I don't think the portion would be enough for men though."}
{"text":"I opted for the Aburi Premium meal - as I guess a good number of others do as well went eating here. It comes with a couple appetizers, 8 or 9 pieces of Aburi sushi (as best as I can remember) and 2 rolls.

Since the main part of the meal - their namesake - knocked it out of the park for me, I'll leave it with a 4 star review. However, the edamame beans at the beginning would barely split open, and the 2 handrolls at the end were almost unenjoyable.

There was a bit of a longer wait for the food than expected. It could mean that they need to improve on that; however, it could also mean that patrons should expect it since there could be more effort and precision involved in the making of the pressed sushi and unique method of torching.  Since it's a pretty unique experience for me, it's hard to judge.

I won't list the different flavours of the sushi pieces, but each were delicious and the server provided great detail about each one. \"Flavour Profile\" is a bit of a cliche when describing food, but they truly do put a lot of thought into how they combine the ingredients for each piece. I really enjoy aburi (torched sushi), and here it's done with precision and slightly more subtle than other places I've been to.

The two rolls were not a good way to end the meal unfortunately. I've never been one to enjoy a big bite at once of seaweed - I don't really like cones for example. In this case, it was virtually double rolled. It dominated the taste and made it very hard to chew. Perhaps that is an acceptable and traditional way to prepare it - but it's certainly not to my taste. Even the filling (spicy salmon and blue crab) were not at the same heights of the previous courses.

I'll still leave it as a largely positive review since I really loved the sushi pieces. I wouldn't hesitate to return and order those individually."}
{"text":"Decent place for set nigiri/sushi set. Reasonably priced. Clean modern decor with seating at the back thats hidden. Love the big windows that allow sunlight in. Overall good food - def worth coming to try."}
{"text":"The sushi was damn sexy.  But it was kinda like going out with a gorgeous girl, who's a bit of a princess and didn't have much to say.

Ordered the Omakase and it was the first time ever having pressed. It was quite tasty, but the hand roll was tough.  Had to eventually try and swallow the whole thing in one bite.

The servers were all very nice, but it was quite slow.  Luckily we weren't in much of a hurry, but the pace could pick up just a tad.

It's a nice little spot, and I'll probably be back to giver another shot and hopefully can give a better update."}
{"text":"I personally did really enjoy my experience here. It's a cute little place with the perfect decor for that perfect Instagram picture. It's nice here but there are so many other sushi places in the city I don't think it's a go-to type of place as you can get a better bang for your buck elsewhere with similar concepts in food. Nevertheless, a nice experience to try. 

We had the aburi premium during lunch which was $25 which comes with everything as shown in the pictures. The food itself was good, but nothing necessarily stood out to me. My two cons though were the rolls and the rice; the seaweed was so hard to chew and the rice kept falling apart like crazy. It didn't take away from the fact that it still tasted good, just a little annoying. 

The special of the day was a scallop sushi which had a nice texture to it but as someone who doesn't like wasabi it wasn't my favourite but it was still nice."}
{"text":"Visited Sat May 26 for dinner. Yes there is good sushi in North York! 
We ordered the Lite (6 pieces + handroll) and Premium (10 pieces + handroll). This style of Omakase is quite unusual, as a traditional tasting menu takes at least 45 min or longer. At Aburi, the Omakase comes all at once in 10 min. Both orders were quite filling, 
No wasabi came with our meal which was odd. Low sodium soya sauce is already on the table and noticeably thicker than usual. It was a nice and quiet place to enjoy a dinner. As we sat at the front, the large glass windows created a fish-bowl effect with people walking on the street watching us eat. Service was friendly and attentive, but the server didn't even pour water for us. 

Pros
Wow deliciously tender and melt in your mouth sushi! 
Private dining space in the back for about 30 people. 
Food comes fast, if that is what you want. 

Cons
No brown rice available. 
The platter comes with all of the pieces at once, it would have been nice to have some pacing to the meal. 
Hand rolls came about 15 min after the main platters, it felt a bit odd as the hand rolls are quite filling. 
No dessert menu. 

Protip
Make reservations as this place gets busy. 

Damage $61 after tax before tip."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5.

The aburi sushi was very good but overall there seemed to be something lacking. I got the premium aburi set ($32).

The appetizers came with edamame, salmon wakame, and cucumber cabbage (?) salad. I felt the appetizers were pretty weak and bland. It would've been nice that instead of 3 'salad' type dishes, they would do a soup instead. The edamame was very bland and wet, a bit disappointing. The cucumber salad was very vinegary but had no other flavor. The salmon wakame was again too vinegary, I felt like there were too many vinegary dishes for the appetizer. 

The main aburi sushi set was very good though, each one had interesting toppings and a different flavor profile.

They ended it with 2 handrolls which again, felt underwhelming and also awkward to eat since it was a long fat roll that you had to eat with your hands. There wasn't much in the hand roll except salmon/crab. After the great aburi sushi set, ending it with this seemed lacking. If they ended it with something sweet, it would've been a good ending. 

The service was okay, they seemed a bit awkward and confused but I get it, they just opened. 

Not sure if I would be back, maybe if they improve certain things I will give them another chance. The decor was beautiful though!"}
{"text":"Ambiance wise, the lights were a little too bright and the decor doesn't equate with the price point. 
The music they play doesn't go well with the restaurant. It wasn't too busy but yet after finishing the three starter sides, no one collects our plates. I find that they visit the table beside us to fill water more often. Waitress doesn't seem to remember well every sushi on the plate. 

I've ordered the Aburi premium and Aburi signature.  Presentation wise, it was nice. Overall, the sushi lacks flavours. In terms of Aburi the flavour and fish should go well enough that you don't need any soya sauce. Or if it was aged fish, the sauce or topping will not require soya sauce. Anyways, for me this was a overall a rather disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, with relatively reasonably priced aburi. The decor was beautifully modern with high ceilings and big windows, but the place was a little small. There's a main dining area as well as a more secluded area near the back, but again it's not a huge place so definitely make reservations if you're a party of 4+. The only thing that threw me off were their menus - little dinky ripped paper menus... to be honest it made me and my friend laugh considering how well thought out everything else was in terms of presentation.

I wasn't particularly hungry so I opted for the Lite option. It came with 3 apps and a plate of aburi sushi, and ended with 2 handrolls. We totally forgot about the handrolls and were so full by the end of it that we could hardly finish.

In terms of quality, it's much better than any AYCE place for sure, so if you're ready to try some real aburi, I would recommend this place especially because of the price and the simple menu."}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY!  This place is an absolute experience!  I am a huge sushi fan, but I have never had sushi like this before!  I came here on a recommendation of a friend, because she said that it was very similar to a restaurant in NYC called SugarFish, and now I totally understand the hype.


(Food:)
We got the ABURI PREMIUM OMAKASA for dinner and I felt like I was on drugs.  This dish comes with 10 pieces of sushi and two hand rolls.  Honestly, it seems a bit pricey for only 10 pieces, but my god is it an experience.  Each sushi had a different feel to it, a different taste and a different texture.  Even the 'regular' salmon sushi was mind-blowing.  There's something about the garnishes that they put on, how they torch the fish and even the texture of the rice, that makes this sushi phenomenal.  I would absolutely recommend getting this dish!  The presentation of this was also amazing!

We also go the ABURI CHIRASHI TART was served to us smoked and encased in a glass bell jar.  As she lifted the lid of the jar, tendrils of smoke escaped to reveal this beautiful cake-like rice dish.  This was also delicious, with multiple layers of different flavours.


(Price:)
The ABURI PREMIUM OMAKASA: $32 (expensive I know, but totally worth it)

The ABURI CHIRASHI TART: $15 


(Service:)  
Amazing service!  Since we only ordered one ABURI PREMIUM OMAKASA, we only were supposed to get one set of appetizers, but they were so nice to give us a second one for me and my sister to share.  
They were also very attentive, as once we were done with the sushi plate, they came and gave us our handrolls.  (It was as if they were watching us :O)

(Ambience:)
Beautiful!  The indoor decorations were lovely.  You really need a quiet atmosphere to experience this meal, because most of the time you kind of zone out in reaction to the food.


(Overall:)
Uncomparable!  There is no sushi place like it that I have tried!  Even my favourite Mi-Ne can not compare!"}
{"text":"This is an EXCELLENT place if you want the omakase experience without breaking your wallet ($22-30 for tasting menu). I generally love Aburi sushi, so I was really excited to try this place out. The waitresses were super attentive and the ambience is great for a date. 

Food-wise, everything tasted delicious and they had a diverse selection of different sushis. Everything lasted light and fresh. Definitely no qualms here. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to Miku/Saku - I would recommend here, so as long as you are not starving. 

At the end, I was satisfied, but if you're someone who has a big appetite - perhaps come here if you've had a late lunch."}
{"text":"Very reasonable pricing, especially for omakase. My only complaint is there's not a huge variety on the menu but if you enjoy Aburi sushi, you'll have no problem. The fish taste really fresh and not too oily."}
{"text":"great sushi....although appetizers were meh....got the premium set...good service, kudos to the girl for doing well even though I could tell she was nervous

-1 for not taking AMEX as a higher-priced establishment"}
{"text":"Got the aburi premium lunch set . Quality of the fish was good and the toppings were paired well. However the quality of the rice really needs to be improved. The rice is not packed well enough so the whole sushi falls apart pretty quickly . It seems like the rice and fish are separately entity , and not a one full piece when you eat it. The rice is not juicy and melts with the fish when you bite it , say compared to miku .

Also , the chirashi tart was really loosely packed, so if you want to divide it to share, all the rice falls apart and it just feels like a plate of rice with pieces of salmon mixed in. 

The ambience and service was pretty good though. High ceiling , natural lighting , and attentive servers.

Good spot to try but wouldn't come back unfortunately ."}
{"text":"The Aburi Room is very aesthetically pleasing with their fake ivy wall decor, grey leather seats and white surroundings. The food is equally as aesthetically pleasing however, not as pleasing when it comes to taste. 

Aburi Plate ($52) 
We were given everything as said on the menu except the otoro (fatty tuna). The cuts of fish were of good quality but the undercooked/cold rice and the heavy handed-ness of the wasabi ruined it. Something that I've always noticed with omakase is the temperature of the rice. It may not be important to some people but for someone who's tried a few other omakase experiences, I expected the rice to be warm and definitely not undercooked. 

I would recommend this place if you're craving aburi sushi and are not able to go downtown. Their ebi oshi is worth a try! They do it quite similar to a lot of places with the basil cream sauce. 
Another thing that kind of irked me was that they didn't offer us tea but that's definitely my own personal preference!"}
{"text":"I love aburi sushi so I had to try this new spot. The restaurant decor and ambiance was modern and chic. I went with one other person for lunch on a Saturday and was able to get a seat right away. 

We both ordered the Aburi Signature which was $30 which came with 3 little starters - edamame, seaweed salad and salmon tartare. The combo itself had 5 pieces of sushi, 5 pieces of aburi and 2 handrolls. 

I really enjoyed all the aburis, they had good flavour and was a good size. I liked that they give a variety of different aburis so you're not stuck with the same flavours over and over again. 

I liked the appetizers they gave at the beginning as well. They were a good portion. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the handrolls - one was a spicy tuna and the other was some sort of crab meat. The flavour was lacking and the seaweed was very soggy which made it hard to eat. 

Overall I would say it's good value for what you get. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"If you're wondering what 'Aburi' means, it means partially grilled and partially raw sushi. Aburi Room is conveniently located in North York facing Park Home Ave (Yonge Street/Park Home). I'm not a huge AYCE fan so Aburi Room is perfect for mt appetite (diet). We tried the Aburi Premium Omakase dinner ($32) and every piece of sushi was made-to-perfection. Fresh fish is very important especially when having aburi sushi, the technique must be well-controlled in the process of making them. I was very impressed with Aburi Room's aburi, the torched sections were not overly done, sauce was so good we didn't need to use soy sauce or wasabi, rice texture was perfect and love their interior concrete decor."}
{"text":"I had been hearing about this place for a while and really wanted to check it out. Best part was that it wasn't too far from me and I didn't have to trek all the way downtown.

Decided to go with the premium Omakase menu (they have a light version as well).  The starters were edamame, salad and salmon.  The pressed sushi was really nice.  Really flavourful and pressed nicely.  The server explained everything we were eating, but honestly I can't remember 8 different flavours.  Needless to say they were all good.  I believe you got about 8 or so pieces.  

Then next up were the hand rolls (2).  The seaweed wrapper must have been old b/c I couldn't even bite into it to eat it. It was embarrassing so after a bit I just started eating the inside part....lol.  

I wish they ended the Omakase with some small dessert.  It would have ended the meal nicely.  But unfortunately after the hand rolls, that was it.  I'm not sure if the premium was worth the $32 to be honest.

The service while friendly was a bit slow - but it's a new place so probably working out the kinks. 

It's a nice spot and I might be back to try some other items on the menu if I'm up this way."}
{"text":"WHAT I GOT: 
Aburi Premium Omakase (chef's choice assortment of apps, sushi, aburi oshi, and hand rolls) and the Smoked Aburi Chirashi Tart.

TASTE: [5/5]
The fish tasted fresh and the sauces/toppings used on each item were flavourful and paired well with the fish. The scallop sushi and truffle ebi aburi oshi were my favourites from the omakase. The scallop was sweet and fresh, whereas the truffle ebi had an interesting smokey flavour. I would definitely come back and order these two and the smoked tart again!

PRESENTATION: [4/5]
The food was presented on simple and modern tableware which allowed you to fully appreciate each piece of sushi art. The smoked tart is served on a plate with a glass covering that contains the smoke until you're ready to eat, this was pretty cool.

SERVICE: [4/5]
When we arrived at the restaurant, staff were welcoming and friendly. They gave us choice with regards to where we wanted to dine (natural lighting vs. dim lit). Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and prompt. She carefully explained the items we were curious about by referring to images on her phone.

THE LAST WORD: 
Aburi Room is a place you need to visit if you like flame-seared (aburi) or pressed sushi (oshi). Definitely try the Aburi Chirashi Tart and pay the extra $3 for the smoked version. The pricing of the omakase options were very affordable (e.g., $22, $32, and $52) and I am looking forward to coming here again for my next aburi and oshi craving."}
{"text":"Really as good as it gets. The omakase- to go box is to die for. Really educating you on how to eat it (in ascension) and how it'd be best eaten with. I especially loved the shrimp and truffle sushi. Definitely a spot I'd go back to"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Thursday around 1pm. It wasn't busy but the restaurant definitely had more seating than I thought. We got the aburi signature to try all the different fish. 
It also comes with a little appetizer to start which I didn't see in the menu- nice touch. 
$30 for 10 pieces of quality sushi and 2 handrolls is a steal in my opinion. 
The oshi sushi I don't think was anything special- the star was surprisingly the truffle shrimp aburi. 
The aburi of the day was scallop- very fresh. Most of the aburi were pretty tasty. 
The servers were also good, they kept coming back to check up on us and refill our teas."}
{"text":"Food was decent but service was so-so. We got the Aburi Lite Omakase and when the food arrived our server just dropped off our plates without a word (even though we observed other tables get detailed explanations of each sushi and garnish). Also when we had to pay the server just dropped off the machine and disappeared. Small things like that are not deal breakers but it does leave a negative impression.

Food overall was ok, there were 6 pcs of aburi/Oahu sushi and two hand rolls. I didn't care much for the hand rolls but the sushi was nice and the garnish went well with each piece."}
{"text":"It's all in the details! Not only is this place instagram-worthy, aesthetically pleasing, the taste and quality of the food is amazing. 
The Aburi Plate comes with the same 3 appetizers and 12 pieces of premium fish with premium garnishes. I believe I got better cuts of the fish. Most of the fish tasted fresh. Different flavours were brought out in each bite/aburi. The scallop was sweet, but the garlic chip was unnecessary and overpowered that. Other than that, the garnishes were well thought of and even seasoned. 
 
Since they label this as \"omakase\" I felt like it needed a final course after the sushi to end.. like a small soba or dessert would be nice. I did feel full from the fattiness of the fish but I felt like I was left hanging. Maybe they wanted to end on a high and aburi is what they are good at."}
{"text":"I went to Aburi Room for lunch and tried their aburi premium lunch menu. It includes 3 appetizers, 8 pieces of Aburi sushi and 2 hand rolls. The waitress told me that it's the best value out of the 3 lunch tasting menus. 

The portion was quite good and enough for me as lunch. 
I definitely enjoyed the Aburi sushi! The creamy sauce,  truffle and fatty fish tasted delicious! The other pieces of the lunch wasn't as memorable. But I'd definitely go back for more and wish they have a menu with just a variety of the Aburi sushi!"}
{"text":"More sushi in North York? Yes please!

Aburi Room is in a pretty convenient location near North York Centre, but it's easy to miss as it's tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Yonge Street. My friend and I came by for lunch on a Saturday, and there was only one other table occupied. Decor is modern minimalistic (my favourite), with a cute fish design on their menus and takeout boxes.

The staff are all very friendly, and each dish was described thoroughly as it was served. We each ordered an \"Aburi Lite\" from their tasting menu, and shared an aburi ebi oshi. The tasting menu doesn't look like a lot of food, but it's actually very filling. A fabulous way to try a variety of top quality sushi. 

I think my favourite from the tasting menu was the truffle shrimp sushi. I hadn't really tried truffle before, but these flavours worked really well together. I was surprised that the hand roll came last, but it ended up being a great way to remind my palate of some classic tastes.

The total per person ended up being around $25. 100% worth it for the quality and amount of food."}
{"text":"After much letdown from the last omakase restaurant at Assembly Chef's Hall, this restaurant restored some faith for new omakase places. Very happy with the overall quality, presentation, and impressive decor worthy to bring your SOs to.

There were 3 selections to the omakase menu to choose from
Aburi Light $22
Aburi Premium $32 - Chose this one
The Aburi Plate $52

====

MENU - April 13, 2018

Starters

1. Edamame: Just regular ol' boiled soy beans

2. Pickled cucumber & cabbage salad: Not a big fan of this

3. Sashimi Tartar: 2 sashimi pieces with tobiko (crab roe) sitting on wakame (kelp)

Aburi Nigiri / Sushi / Oshizushi

4. Tuna Sushi: An akami cut but without the bloody taste

5. Salmon Sushi: Topped with tobiko; nice and creamy taste to the salmon

6. Hamachi: Generously cut and so nice with the torched surface [HIGHLY RECOMMENDED] 

7. Shrimp: Tasted much better than your average shrimp sushi. 

8. Hotate Sushi - Daily Sushi

9. Truffle Shrimp - Found this one of the most delicious pieces. The truffle on top of the flambéd miso past tasted so nice. Texture is soft and completely melts in your mouth like butter. [HIGHLY RECOMMENDED] 

10. Aburi Albacore - Ethical and not stale

11. Salmon Oshizushi: Tasted rich and aromatically pleasing [HIGHLY RECOMMENDED] 

12. Saba (Mackerel) Aburi - Daily Aburi: Better than  your average mackerel sushi you'd get from other sushi places.

*Did not really like the latter, seaweed was chewy & not crispy

13. Crab Handroll: A bit fishy for my taste which was weird for crab

14. Salmon & Cucumber - Daily Handroll: It was ok, didn't really speak volume to me in terms of taste.

====

Left this place happy with a full stomach; at a level where everything you ate afterwards did not taste the same.

So why didn't it receive 5 stars? Well, for one we sat by the windows with an ice storm going on outside; temperature was set uncomfortably cold at 20°C & due to our proximity relative to the windows, tea got cold fast. While we did drape our jackets on, it was bulky and made difficult to eat. That's not to say the servers were inattentive; they were quite attentive! It was just that our teas were never refilled until we asked for it. Did I mention we were freezing? 

Will I return? Yes yes yes, 100x yes! Perhaps I will try the smoked Chirashi for an additional $3; looks so gorgeous!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is still in the soft opening phase, but we were so impressed it will definitely be a repeat for us. Located in the heart of North York near the Civic Centre. 

The restaurant looks smaller than it is because of a center dividing wall. I think this helps it down noise too.

We were a bit early for our reservation but our table was waiting. I was glad to find our table had comfy chairs rather than the tables with benches. This restaurant is quite lovely, relaxing and clean. Service was excellent.

We had for two people:
Premium sushi - a large set dinner. I nibbled a couple of things that were delicious but focused mainly on the next two items.
Chirashi with smoke - this is a generous size and the fish runs through the middle of the cake as well. I like smoked fish and the smoke was fun to boot. Yummy.
Aburi sushi - when I asked if salmon or ebi was better our server let me know I could do half of each which was perfect. So good.
Sapporo beer
Niagara Riesling

We were full and happy. We felt the price was quite reasonable given the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice is the look: sparse and open, bare greys and faux wood browns, intimate yet energized, with hanging \"vine lights\" that illuminate both the open kitchen and the food that's about to come from it. The first thing you notice about Aburi Room is the \"room\" part, and how different it is from other sushi (and even non-sushi) places in the area.

Of course, we were here for the \"aburi\" part, so let's get to that. After a 15-20 minute wait (no reservations for a party of 2 at 8:30pm on a Friday night), we were whisked to our table and promptly ordered:

1) Aburi Premium tasting menu
- The appetizers (salmon sashimi on a bed of seaweed, edamame, salad) were standard fare.
- The 10 pieces of aburi sushi were really good. The flame seared flavour came through but what was pleasantly surprising was that the \"milky\"/fattg taste of the seafood also strongly came through. The searing was obviously done skillfully.
- The 2 handrolls (blue crab and spicy salmon) were ok. I know some reviews have said the nori is too tough to chew through. I was fine with it, though I usually eat handrolls with my hand (vs using chopsticks) so I guess that helps.

2) Aburi Lite tasting menu: Same as the Aburi Premium menu, though with only 6 aburi sushi pieces.

3) Chirashi Tart: While it was definitely good, I think it was a tad overhyped, simply because it looks pretty so is very Instagram-able. I paid up for the smoked version, and while the smokey taste did come, I'm not sure if it was worth the $3 extra.

Overall a good experience. Aburi sushi was well done, everything else tasted standard, service was pleasant and efficient, the meal was a tad expensive (and definitely a lot more than other sushi places nearby) but not ridiculously so given what you're getting. I'd recommend to try once, especially if you're looking for something different in the area."}
{"text":"Bleh. Cold rice that is flavoured powerfully with the same salty/sweet taste. It makes all their dishes taste the same. Service was good though."}
{"text":"Visited this newly opened sushi restaurant with my better half last week. 

Decor and ambiance was nice, a very clean look we ordered the omakase menu. Don't remember the names but one from the middle priced option, and one from the highest.

Wait staff were polite and gave a brief description on the type of fish. While the price is high, relative to quality of fish you are getting its worth it as a treat.  Not the same drawn out experience as compared to a place like Yasu's.  But it's also 1/2 the price.

I heard the wait staff speaking with other customers in Japanese, so I infer it's owned and operated by Japanese. 

-1 star because of dessert.  And order of ice cream indicates its two scoops. The waitress we had said we weren't allowed to mix ice cream flavours.  (Although clearly in pictures others posted, this is possible). Perhaps I'm too polite and didn't insist. So instead of having a possible combination of 3 flavours, we had two orders of ice cream with once flavour each."}
{"text":"A must come for sushi lovers! Staff were very patient with us as we took forever. 

Reservations was easy and they were able to accommodate with a high chair. 

I ordered the..
Oshi Salmon - I was deciding between this and the Ebi. Got to sample both but I'm so happy I went with the Salmon! It was so good. Perfectly torched with a little kick from the japaleno.
Chirashi tart - Was pricy but very worth it! You might even be full after eating this. I was surprised as it appeared smaller in photos but it's about a 4.5 - 5 inch tart. 

Parking was a bit annoying but we were lucky and got a spot right outside.

Definitely worth coming back!"}
{"text":"We will keep this review simple and sweet. 
Instagram worthy place. Good tasting food. Picture/ video worthy food. 

Greeted well upon arriving and sat close the window. The place has Edison bulbs, fish, and leaves. It looks almost like a chique  cafe but serves aburi sushi. 

The menu is omakase based so it starts of with a $22, $32 and $52.  From a. Lite menu to a premium menu. There's also appetizers and individual rolls or oishizushi you can order. 

We ordered 2 things to share a premium omakase and Chirashi tart + 

For the chirashi tart if you are aware of miku's tart or momosan's tart same idea. But this has a +. You can smoke it with Sakura? Wood and it's served in front of you. Aromatic and dramatic. $3 upcharge for the experience. Did it do anything to it? Not really in my opinion. The tart was fantastic on its own. Spicy tuna, avocado, scallops and shrimp. 

Premium omakase is served with 3 small apps, edamame, cabbage and salmon tataki. 
Everything is ok. Nothing great. Salmon is fresh. 
For the premium omakase the platter is stunning and might I say a lot of thought was put into it. 
If you have been to Park restaurant  Montreal, they do the same thing we're in they put a non traditional garnish on top of the sushi. From avocado to foie to unagi to gold flakes. There's 12 pcs served on the platter and everything tasted different. From uni to otoro to manguro to mackerel. I've enjoyed every bite of it.

Liqueur license is not available today I was told it's available next week. 
Give it a shot place seems promising. Food took a while with a pretty empty restaurant so now I'm wondering if it's busy how will they cope with it. 
Price for 2 things plus tip is $90-something. Pretty pricey but worth it. Will come back and would recommend"}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi spot in Toronto! I saw them cut really really fish at the bar and knew today was gonna be a good day. The appetizers came out and the salmon which was one of the apps just melted in my mouth! It was that good! They put different sauces that go with each fish and everything come out perfect. The rice didn't fall apart and everything held nicely. I think tuna was my favorite! We also got the chirashi tart which was also really good and smoky! Is was really beautiful and although it looks small it was very filling because they packed in all the fish and rice layers! I definitely recommend because of the quality and freshness of the fish and also clean presentation but most importantly it tasted good! Every bite was a different story to tell."}
{"text":"Great place for gourmet sushi at an affordable price. 
Ordered premium set and chirashi tarte
The appetizers were ok the seaweed with the fish and edamame were good but the pickled veggie was ok. Every piece in the set was unique and delicious. This is prob where you get your moneys worth
The hand rolls that came after had soggy seaweed making it a little chewy. Should be more crisp imo

The chirashi tarte was great very delicious nothing bad about it. Presentation was good also. 

Overall great place to experience unique gourmet sushi. Its a little bit more expensive compared to what you get at other sushi places but you dont come here for that kind of sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious aburi omakase at a very reasonable price.  Couple with beautiful modern decor makes the dining experience very enjoyable.  

Our group of 7 came here for dinner on a Friday night. Luckily we made reservations otherwise we could end up waiting for a while. The menu is relatively simple, you have three different tasting menu ranging from lite to premium plus some a la carte items. I chose the regular while the hubby chose the premium. As the name implies, you get premium fish and garnish with the premium set.   I have to say, all the garnish was so thoughtfully and exquisitely paired with each type of fish. It enhanced the flavours immensely and just bought the taste to the next level.  

The turnover is fairly quick, from start to finish, it only took 1.5 hours. I can't wait to go Back!"}
{"text":"For the meal I had, I'd rate this place a 3-3.5. The environment was quiet and intimate and the service was good. The sushi was also pretty tasty (although the sauces overpowered the fish a bit) and I felt like the prices were pretty fair. Given all of that, I would have probably rated this place a 4. 

Unfortunately, the rice in our sushi was noticeably undercooked. I had to chew through some hard grains of rice and the sushi fell apart when I picked it up. It's essential to have properly cooked rice -  I've almost never had this problem at other sushi restaurants. I'm hoping our experience was a one-off, but I couldn't rate this place a 4 for the meal I had. I'll be back since I enjoyed my meal enough to give it another chance, but if we get undercooked rice again it won't be worth it."}
{"text":"3.5 Star

Love the set up of the dinning area! The huge windows letting in plenty of sunlight gives this place a feel of peace and zen.

Arriving for a late lunch around 2:30 pm. I was the last table for the lunch hour so service was attentive and food came out fast.

Aburi Signature ($30) - 10 aburi pressed sushi + 2 handrolls + 3 small apps. 

- The app is just passable. Something that AYCE serves, good to tie you over while waiting for the sushi

- I enjoyed the Aburi Sushi a lot. I like the varieties and they all looked pretty. I though have to guess what condiments and garnish used. I do understand it is difficult for the waitress to explain every single order to every table but some information would have been nice.

- Hand rolls were both a fail. The seaweed was soggy and chewy. The blue crab rolls sounded like a good idea but it was just mushy without contrasting texture and have no flavour aside of fishiness.  

I might come back in the future but hopefully they would have solve the \"handroll\" issues. That seems to be the most common complaint from everyone.

I kind of wish they have a real omakase option. Having the fish listed a printed menu does not feel too omakase."}
{"text":"Tucked away on a side street across from North York Center lies the amazing Aburi Room. Walking in, I was surprised by the clean and modern feel of the entire place. I loved the decor, with its pristine white tables and hints of black and grey furnishings.  The kitchen is completely open concept, with large windows facing a park on the other side. Its a decent sized restaurant with ~10 tables, but it just feels so much bigger cause of the high ceiling and large windows. 

Theres 3 set menus that includes set sushi pieces, some appetizer, and daily featured rolls and nigiri. Theres a small selection of a la cart items and alcoholic options. We opted for the premium and the daily set menus, with the chirashi sushi tart smoked added on top. The chirashi tart was so delicious, what an unexpected treat. We had it smoked for an extra dollar, and you can actually tell a difference! The set sushi pieces were all very fresh, with some very bold flavours. I wasnt a fan of the mackerel, but my boyfriend loved it. Though I do have to say, the salmon pieces were absolutely amazing. 

For the price, id say this place is a must visit for sushi lovers. 

100% would recommend."}
{"text":"WOW. I was pleasantly surprised with Aburi Room. I knew I would like it judging by the photos but I actually fell in love with it. The high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows flooded the restaurant with natural light (great for photos) and makes it feel airy & spacious.

I was able to get street parking right in front of the restaurant. I made reservations for my partner's birthday on a Monday night. There were couples scattered here and there but it wasn't busy. We were seated instantly and our food was served pretty quickly.

The food was (mostly) magnificent. My partner ordered the Aburi Premium ($32) and I ordered the Aburi Lite ($22). On top of that, we ordered a Chirashi Tart (supposedly $15) to share.

The Aburi Premium, for $10 more than the Lite, has four additional pieces (1 daily sushi, 1 daily aburi, 1 aburi albacore and 1 shrimp sushi). So roughly $2.50 a piece.  You're served the three appetizers first. Next comes the sushi. I normally don't eat any sashimi other than salmon. This time, I ate everything on my plate. I love the strong flavour of the torched sushi and the garnishes were paired perfectly well. I do think that they could've went a little lighter on the mayo on some but it was delicious overall. There was only one piece of sushi I had that tasted slightly fishy (I have no idea what it was). We were both stuffed at this point, but we still had to tackle the Chirashi Tart.

The Chirashi Tart, arrived between the appetizers and the sushi. I normally love chirashi bowls - you get a little taste of everything. You can get the Chirashi Tart smoked and it's presented wonderfully. They will ask if you want to take photos and to let them know when you're ready. But the presentation does not make up for its terrible taste. DO NOT ORDER THIS. It was drenched in sauce and extremely salty. When we got the bill, they had charged us $18 instead of $15 but unfortunately I didn't realize until I was home.

Our sever then came over with the hand rolls. It completely slipped our minds because we were already so full, so this was a nice surprise. The presentation of the handrolls were not so nice. Think of a maki roll but thinner and before it's cut into pieces. Just as I was thinking that the presentation needed improvement, I saw the table next to me get theirs and it was cut in half at an angle and plated nicely. Maybe they forgot to cut ours?

Anyways, I still loved the sushi and can't wait to go back. I think we would both order Aburi Lite for next time. While it doesn't seem like a lot on the menu, it's actually pretty filling. I would never ever recommend the Chirashi Tart. I do recommend checking your bill. You also get two scoops of ice cream if it's your birthday."}
{"text":"Aburi Room is located on Park Home Avenue a step away from Yonge St. This new Japanese eatery opened this past month and specializes in omakase (tasting menus) which feature different types of fish. I dropped by for dinner to try the new place. For  dinner, they offer 3 different types of omakase sets as well as a la carte items. My partner and I decided to both get the Aburi Premium omakase set for $32 per person.

The Aburi Premium omakase came with 10 pieces of assorted sushi, 2 hand rolls, edamame, salad, and a sashimi tartare dish. Overall, the assorted sushi was good, but nothing outstanding; there are definitely better Japanese restaurants that serve better sushi. The appetizer dishes were somewhat lackluster and the hand rolls were underwhelming (quality of seaweed was mediocre). 

Service was friendly and attentive but food was just average. This will probably be my first and last time at Aburi Room."}
{"text":"I came for dinner and mostly loved it. 
There are things that definitely need to be changed but it's still a new place so I'm sure they're just working on things but I stand by the 3 stars

Location:
Yonge and empress. It's kitty corner to the north York Centre subway stop

Parked situation:
There's a surprising large amount of parking. There are three public lots within a few minutes walk (across the streets) and on street parking. ,

Decor:
Pretty, it's small, but with big windows that let in the sun, it's really nice! Mostly two tops and a couple of 4 tops. Not really meant as a group place. Great for date night or catching up with girlfriends

Two complaints. The table for 4 has backless benches so that 6 can be squeezed in. It's not comfortable for that. Not sure if it was our table but at one point we had to stop eating and blow on our hands to warm them up because the air conditioning was blowing on us.
 
Staff:
Men making the sushi and women serving it. :(
The  server we had that night needed to keep repeating everything because we couldn't hear her.

Food:
We all got the premium omakase option. It's not a real omakase, they tell you what you are getting, apps, sushi, hand rolls.

I liked the apps. Edamame, something with raw salmon and a salad of some sort (couldn't hear the server when she was describing it) they were a nice start.

The sushi - yeah 5 stars. This is what I always want to eat. Perfect balance. Everyone was super. I generally hate eel and loved the eel here. Two thumbs way up. Only problem -the rice didn't stay whole, they kept breaking apart and it was kinda messy at time.

And then.... the handrolls. Why for the love of god are you still serving these? The reviews are filled with people telling you they are terrible. They ARE terrible.  They were dry,the nori rolled almost three times around. One was flavourless, the other looked like tuna salad but tasted weird. I have no idea what they were because we couldn't hear the server. 

So there was no little sweet thing to end the meal. Those horrid hand rolls did. Blah. You may want to give people a scoop of ice cream to end it because  all I really think about is how terribly the meal ended. 

I'll be back but only to get the a la carte."}
