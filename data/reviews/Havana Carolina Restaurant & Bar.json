{"text":"I found this gem the other day. Loved my Cuban sandwich and fried plantains. Just had the best tamales. You have to try this place"}
{"text":"My go to for a Cuban caffeine  fix and Latin comfort food.   The Cuban Sandwiched are just right!!!"}
{"text":"I am a native of Miami and was so happy to find this gem of a restaurant. Very authentic dishes. The Cuban bread reminds me of home. The yuca and plantains and black beans were deelish!! I love the masas de puerco-perfectly cooked and seasoned My dinner companions enjoyed an authentic Cuban sandwich and flan for dessert. Good and freshly made Margaritas. I will go back many times!!! Omar was a fabulous server."}
{"text":"Was so glad to hear that this place reopened. My family and I had been to the other location but just for Cuban bread.   I was excited to take my wife and actually have a meal. The waiter was very warm and friendly. We ordered some plantain chips, a papa rellena, and two ham croquettes as starters. We're Cuban and haven't had these in a long time.  The order of chips was small, which was disappointing.  They were tasty though. The papa rellena was excellent, had great seasoning in the meat. The ham croquettes were just like back home (Miami, FL) and hit the spot.  We both ordered the same thing as our entrees... Bistec empanizado (breaded steak), with morros.  I had it with tostones (fried green plantains) and my wife with maduros (fried sweet plantains).  The steak was full of flavor. It was great having it after so long. The morros were disappointing. It was very bland and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a long time. My tostones were stale and cold. My wife's maduros were good but the amount given was three very small ones so that was disappointing. We ordered a flan for dessert and two Cuban espressos. The flan was oh so good! The coffees were great BUT EXPENSIVE!! $2.50 each!! We won't be having that again!   We were able to take home some Cuban pastries. We haven't had them in years so this was great. We took some guava and some cheese... both delicious and we'll definitely bring some of those home when we go back.  We enjoyed our first visit for the most part. Service was excellent, five huge stars. We hope next time to try something different and the food be five stars because it was lacking some this time around. We will be back though."}
{"text":"Food is decent but don't be in a hurry.   Servers like to stand in a circle and chat while drinks are empty.  You have to get up and go interrupt them to ask for a refill."}
{"text":"The food looked really good but it took over an hour to get to our table. We had 3 people in our party. The water isn't good.  The waiter didn't update up on the food at all. It wasn't busy at all. Do not eat here if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"I was visiting on business and this restaurant looked quite appealing. I had the Ropa Vieja which is a traditional Cuban dish of shredded meat  olives and onions and it was quite good. The flan was excellent. Portion sizes were not large but service was good prices were average."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this overpriced place for lunch today.  The servers had no idea how the food tasted or was prepared. The signature Cuban sandwich contained dry, chewy, tough, stringy, pork, one slice of thinly sliced processed ham, 1/2 a slice of cheap Swiss cheese, 2 pieces of wet hamburger pickles served on stale Cuban bread.  The \"Cuban\" fries were frozen limp, thick, crinkle cut potatoes.  Don't even consider ordering the Yucca, rice, black beans, and/or plantains.  All of these items were greasy, overcooked, salty, and tasteless (except for the salt flavor).  There were just a few baked goods in the case.  None of them looked tempting enough to try.  I would not recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Quick stop for a Cuban sandwich to go.   Order a Cuban espresso while I waited.  Great espresso.  And, a good Cuban sandwich. The bread made this sandwich."}
{"text":"I was driving over to Charlotte from Raleigh and wanted to stop at a local place for lunch. I looked up Havana Carolina Cafe, saw the reviews and decided to give it a shot. The roast pork got excellent reviews so I ordered it along with fried sweet plantains and congri (rice and beans cooked together).  The roast pork was excellent. It had nice flavor and was prepared well. Not overcooked and quite juicy. There was a huge amount of it as well. Very generous portion. The plantains were terrific. Sweet and soft on the inside with a crispy crust. Best part of the meal. The congri was tasty and nicely cooked. Rice was not overcooked, just right. I only ate half of it as I wanted to save room for a cafe con leche (coffee with milk) and a guava Pastelito.  The coffee was very good. Prepared correctly with the foamy scalded milk. They even put a smiley face on the foam :-) Good rich coffee flavor unlike weak american coffee. The pastelito dough was a little disappointing. I expected a puffy pastry texture, but it was drier with thick layers. Almost like a cracker. Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be. The guava filling was wonderful and the best part. If they can tweak the puffy pastry part, it's a big winner.  The waitress was friendly and very attentive. Service was top notch. I definitely recommend this place. The amount of food for an $8 dish was incredible. Great value for money. Too bad I live so far away or I'd go there often."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic cuban food! I haven't had anything at this restaurant that I did not like and we always recieve good service! My kids really enjoy the shakes and the guava pastries and we all agree the croquettes are our fave!"}
{"text":"love the food here service is super friendly too! i always look foward to coming here"}
{"text":"Went there today. Havana Carolina Cafe is located in a building with shops also inside...The Piccadillo and Ropa Vieja are delicious and are my favorites! Also the Cuban coffee is wonderful! Overall the food and service have been consistently great every time I've been here."}
{"text":"Many locals may remember Havana Carolina when it was located on Cabarrus Avenue. The food was excellent, particularly the hot-pressed Cuban sandwiches. Unfortunately, a fire forced the restaurant to close temporarily.   After some initial growing pains, Havana Carolina re-emerged better than ever. The food is still every bit as good as it was in the old location, but what really sets them apart is their excellent mixed drinks. The mojitos are freshly made and muddled to order with a heap of fresh mint leaves; they are truly outstanding. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here, and as I was walking in I thought this place might be an authentic spot to what I'm used to down in Miami beach ..NOT EVEN CLOSE ...service was extremely nice and friendly (best part of the restaurant) order the beef empanadas, which tasted pretty good, so I was on a good track here ..I got the Cuban grill chicken dish and went completely down hill ..\"chicken\" I'm not even sure it was chicken was so rubbery it was disgusting I could t even finish it, rice was plain white rice not much to say there and the plantains tasted like cardboard ..basically stay away if u think this place will be anything like Miami beach Cuban food. I don't plan on ever going back"}
{"text":"The food is ussually really good. Last time I went it was ok. It was a bland, and the plantains were way too crispy."}
{"text":"Not at all good. I had the steak with sautéed onions and the congri. Steak was dry and tough. No flavor. My wife had the roast chicken with congri. The chicken had a beautiful crisp skin, but inside it was so dry she couldn't eat it.  No sauces or other way to give it some life. The only good thing was the $2.00 beer and the fried yuca. Just can't go back again."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place on the way back home! We got there right when they opened. The host gave us some great recommendations and we got our take out order really fast. The Cuban sandwiches were pressed and the meat was delicious and full of flavor! The sandwich was stuffed with the delicious meat and the cheese was nice and melted.  We also ordered the croquettes and beef empanadas. The croquettes came with this delicious cilantro sauce on the side that I wish I had an entire lifetime supply of. The sauce was perfect and I also used it for the empanadas.  The empanadas are to die for! They were perfectly crispy on the outside yet you still had some of the juice from the beef when you bit into them. There were also some olives in the one I had and it just sent the flavor over the edge.  The prices are more than reasonable and well worth it! I will definitely go back to this place to try more of their great food! The decor was the usual kind of decor for a small Hispanic restaurant, bright colors and pictures of Cuba."}
{"text":"Authentic Cuban in a quaint little indoor shops in Concord.  Sandwich pressed perfectly, tried the traditional Cuban which was excellent but then I tried the Carolina Club, with ham, turkey, swiss cheese with tomato and mayonnaise better than excellent with the Cuban bread.  Wait staff helpful and attentive.  Sweet tea delicious and comes free with sandwiches."}
{"text":"Awesome Cuban coffee shop in the last place you would expect. The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable. The place is found inside a small mall in Concord."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm on the fence about coming back. The food was very good and priced right. The service SUCKS!!! We spent more time waiting on the waitress to greet us and waiting for the check than we spent eating. There were only 5 other tables in there the same time that we were there and they had 3 waitresses. They would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the service"}
{"text":"Very very good.  I am Cuban and lived n Miami for thirty years, this is the real deal. Wow. Cafe con Leche perfect!  Ropa vieja and lechon also perfect. Moros dark and tasty. I drove here from Matthews and will return for sure.  Wait staff was good. Food came in a good amount of time. Fresh hot and flavorful. Tostones were great.  Tres leaches and flan were very very good. This place is real. Mom took home bread and pastries from bakery.  Would and will return! Nicely done Havana Carolina Cafe. Muy Bueno."}
{"text":"We were very plesantly surprised at rhis small cuban eatery.  We were not sure what to expect, but must say that the cortadito was delicious. I had the cuban sampler which was very good, nothing was deipping in grease which was a good sign and the congri was so delicious. The other dish we had was the shredded fried beef which was very good. Good service and we will definately come back."}
{"text":"Love Havana! Such a staple in downtown concord. Best rice and beans in town! If you like Latino food it's the best! I live in Costa Rica for nearly 5 years and the Cuban Menu is similar! Viva Cuba!"}
{"text":"Authentic Cuban food. My mother would approve.  Everything tasted exactly how it should. The servers were friendly. Nice clean place. The only thing was the service was slow to bring the food to the table. I know it's fresh but it was still a bit too slow.  Will not stop me from coming back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and environment. The Cuban sandwich is out the this world, and also the best cuba libre."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Totally exceeded our expectations. We relocated from FL so we are familiar with the authentic taste. We will definitely be back to try many more dishes."}
{"text":"The food was AWESOME and the atmosphere was like being in little Havana!  Would recommend if you are looking for Real Cuban Food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here while checking out our new neighborhood. Cuban music was playing in the background, large ceiling fans and photos of Cuban celebs were all nice touches. The sangria was DELICIOUS and affordable. Ropa vieja was solid although I like mine a little juicer. Cuban sandwich was on point as well. I wish they had more options for children. Will certainly be back to try the vaca frita!"}
{"text":"I really enhoyed the food here, though I found it lacking a bit of seasoning. The empanadas de carne was amazing! I got the ffried pork chunks and they were perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING. Everything from the food to the chef to the decor was authentic. I didn't want the meal to end! Would highly recommend for quality Cuban food."}
{"text":"Looked like a cool place and hey they have Cubanos on the menu! I was in town visiting my bro and wanted some authentic Cuban bread to make my own Cubans!  Found it reasonably priced at I think $2 a loaf (steal) and bought 3. Stuck it in the fridge for 3-4 days before meeting up with my in laws on a camping trip up in Ohio. Made the sandwiches and you have to have this bread - it's the only way to do it right. And yes, I did make my own Pernil (roasted pork) if your going to do it do it right. Can't wait to try this place for lunch and will post back if I do! 4 stars for having the bread and I haven't even tried the food. I'm sure it's good!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying,the sangria is everything and more!The customer service is superb.The waiter really took his time explaining the menu to us ensuring we made a satisfying decision.The food is amazing!It has such an authentic taste.The presentation of the dishes also speaks volume to the food being made with love.I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was very excited when a friend told me about Havana Carolina Cafe & Bakery. The restaurant is located right on Union St., within walking distance of my employer. The location is super convenient; Havana Cafe is right next to Villani's Bakery and Cabarrus Creamery so you and your companions can grab dessert after your meal!  The menu at Havana Carolina Cafe was extensive, with authentic Cuban favorites like Ropa Vieja (shredded beef simmered in tomato-based criollo sauce), Cuban sandwich (\"Mixto\"), Cuban hamburger with a beef and chorizo patty (\"Frita\"), and Lechon Asado (grilled pork in a mojo sauce made with garlic).   Entrees come with a choice of rice, beans, and plaintains. I highly recommend the traditional \"Moors and Christianos\" rice, a mixture of black beans and rice, instead of the separate beans and rice. As for the plaintains, I chose the Platanos Maduros, sweet, fried plaintains. They were my favorite part of the meal! They were moist and perfectly cooked, and went well with every part of my dish.  The server recommended Masas de Puerco, fried chunks of pork braised in Island spices (\"fried crisp on the outside and tender inside\" according to the menu. I was not impressed by this entree. The pork was overcooked and dry. But as I said, the accompaniments were delicious and it was a large portion.   I was torn between three and four stars for Havana Carolina Bakery & Cafe. I decided on three because the central part of my entree was not enjoyable, and it was $9.99 for lunch which is a little expensive. I would like to see them have some lunch specials. I will be eating at Havana Cafe next week with a work colleague. I will update my review then, and see if any of my sentiments change."}
{"text":"Out of towner, had a veggie sandwich; it was really well done. Sandwiches are usually awkward to eat. This was toasted and cut.  If you are vegetarian, you have two choices :-) Service was good, and so was the gal who served me. She was helpful as I was fumbling with my order a bit. Beers a $2, which was awesome. I don't find beers in LA for that price! The bar looked nice, will try it another time.  I was happy, hope they include a bit more veggie options."}
{"text":"We thought we were going in for a real cuban Sandwich  but we were wrong the sandwich  wasn't  bad but it was no cuban the black beans and  rice was very dry and it had no taste we will  not go back"}
{"text":"Poor service. We ordered two waters and a glass of wine. Less than half the tables were full. Fifteen minutes later our waiter works diligently preparing cocktails for people who arrived after us and we still have no beverages. We left and didn't eat."}
{"text":"I've been in Charlotte for a minute now and I've yet to find some authentic Latin food and I wasn't gonna find any here!   Coming from South Florida I was not impressed at all with this restaurant. I'm sure it's great for the locals, but for anyone that knows the truth, they're not even close to authentic Cuban food.   Let's start off with the fact that they don't have \"daily specials\" which is the norm of EVERY Cuban restaurant!   They also don't serve any complimentary bread which is also a MUST in EVERY Cuban restaurant.   We ordered a very simple and traditional dish, Pollo a la plancha (grilled chicken) with rice, beans and plantains. The ONLY thing on my plate that was remotely close to Cuban food was the rice, beans and the maduros.   The chicken was SUPER DRY and VERY TOUGH! Definitely NOT the REAL DEAL. Our server was friendly and the restaurant is nice and clean, but if you want some Authentic Cuban Food, this ain't it!   The prices are ok, but my hunt for REAL latin food continues! Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"This is real Cuban! My favorite Cuban place. I get the \"Midnight\" cubano with sweet bread and the little sweet espresso shot is so great!"}
{"text":"Wow. Sat in this restaurant an hour and a half. Out of the party of nine, four of were fed, two of those were given the wrong food. The kids were melting down. We were waiting on....sandwiches. I love Cuban food and would have really loved to have some today. Not going back there. Do not recommend this for large parties."}
{"text":"The Cuban sandwich and roast pork are as close to Little Havana or Ocho Calle as you will find. The plantains are fantastic also. A great way to spend leisurely hour or so!"}
{"text":"Great place, I had the Cuban steak with papaya shake. My son had the picadiyo with black beans and rice. My son liked my shake so much that he ordered one to go. Good place will return next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love this little place in Downtown Concord. The service is excellent, the food is delicious and fresh. I highly recommend the ropa vieja and their Cuban sandwiches with tres leches for dessert!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Havana Carolina Café.  I came to try their Cuban sandwich, and lo and behold, it was the special of the day.   It took about fifteen minutes for my food to arrive, and I was getting a little antsy. The food was worth the wait though.  The Cuban sandwich that I had today was pretty good, but not as good as the one that I ate at the original Versailles restaurant on Calle Ocho in Miami. The sandwich wasn't pressed, which is typical in a Cuban sandwich, and the roast pork was dry and without much flavor. Without melting the cheese, the only liquid in the sandwich is mustard, and this just doesn't make the sandwich moist enough. It also leaves the bread cold, which is incongruous with the sandwich itself.   The \"maduros,\" their fried sweet plantains, were good.   Service from Oliva, my waitress, was fantastic. I overheard her make several excellent recommendations to other diners. She kept my beverage refilled without being asked. When I complemented her on her great service, she said that today was the fourth day by herself on the job.   I LOVE the décor of the restaurant. The light green paint of the interior has a beautiful swirl pattern ingrained into the walls. The artwork is tasteful and well chosen. The feeling of the restaurant is light and airy, and truly reminiscent of restaurants in Miami. The only thing missing are palm trees in the courtyard.   There is plenty of free, two hour, parking along the street. If there is none in front of the restaurant, just circle the block - you'll find a parking spot nearby.  I ordered a tres leches cake to sample at home, but I haven't gotten around to trying it yet.   ***UPDATE*** I ate the tres leches cake Saturday night, and it was FAN-tastic.   The prices were fairly reasonable, but by the time that I added the maduros, a soda, and the tres leches for dessert, my tab was $13+. Add in a generous tip, and one is pushing a $20 bill.   I'm deducting a star for for the \"dry-ish\" Cuban sandwich. The prices were reasonable, but the wait for food was too long. It only takes a minute to make a sandwich and cut it in half. The plantains came out before the sandwich! Go figure...  Good Cuban food. A charming restaurant, Excellent staff. Friendly owner. If I lived in Concord, I would dine here once a week until I had sampled everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Liked the old location better but same great food and service.  I always bring home a loaf of cuban bread.  Don't skip the plantains if you go but the pre-made plastic cup desserts are a disappointment."}
{"text":"Last place I imagined finding authentic Cuban- but that the t was. Mamey milkshakes, ironber, Matervas,all so good!  They put out a nice Cuban style bruschetta- do nice and refreshing- would have bought it if I could have! We got the Cuban sampler- croquetas were so good - empanadas too! The plantain chops were just ok and the papa tells a wS good. The yuca fries had an amazing cilantro sauce too. Our fritas were excellent too! Perfect flan and cortadito too! Wish it was near where we live in Ct"}
{"text":"Excelente comida, muy buen servicio y perfecto lugar.La mejor comida cubana de North Carolina"}
{"text":"1st off I am a stickler when it comes to service. My expectations were far exceeded! Manny our server was excellent and wanted to make sure we we're having a great time and experience.   From what I was told they have been the new owners since September of 2017. So if you had a bad experience prior to September you need to give them another opportunity to serve you. We started with the Tiny Treasures of Cuba appetizers. Wow! Everything was great. Fried pork chunks we're crispy on the outside and tender in the middle. Croquettes we're also crispy on the out side and light and fluffy on the inside. Yuca fries, Cuban Tamale, Cuban turnovers and more.  The wife had the Ropa Vieja. Tender beef brisket in tomato sauce peppers and onions. It was delicious.  I had of all things their Cuban Burger. Ground beef and sausage grilled onions pressed in a Cuban hamburger buns. It was a tasty twist to an all American sandwich. I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Flan and a cup of Cortadito - Cuban coffee with sweetened condensed milk, topped off a great meal.  Definitely coming back with friends so that they can spread the good word about this place."}
{"text":"The Lechon Asado makes me go to my happy place. We love to stop here when we get in the area. The tostones are delicious and bring me back to my earlier days of working in Newark, NJ. I would recommend you give it a try. There is nothing fancy about the place, a mom and pop type of restaurant, but I have not had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"Being from South Florida, we were really excited to try this place when we happened to be in the area, especially after a friend had recommended it. We arrived around 3PM on a Sunday. They were fairly busy, biggest party was only 8 people though so the kitchen should not have been overwhelmed.  We ordered mariquitas, they came 30 minutes later. For those who don't know, these require zero cooking and should've taken 5 minutes max a as the can be prepped. I had to spit a couple out before I broke a tooth as they were hard as a rock. A few were thicker than plantain chips should be and we're actually soft and unappetizing.  15 minutes later, the server came by and said that a large party had their order in before us and it just came out so ours would be out shortly.  20 minutes later (so we're now over an hour and the \"large\" party was having their dishes cleared), we called the server over and asked for our check. He nodded his head and left. No apology. He returned with the check, again, no apology, no manager coming by to apologize and try to make things right.  We paid for what was brought to the table, even if it was less than edible, and left a note to ask the manager to comp the order so the server could be tipped and look for this review.  As we left, we noticed a table who ordered after us was being served their order.  Hate that I can't review the food, but the experience we've had leaves little to be desired."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by a friend and so we went for dinner.  It was ok. I wasn't happy with what I ordered which was some kind of beef dish. It was dry, stringy. Not very good. The appetizers were very good though.  Ham and cheese croquettes were my favorite.  It's not on the top of our list to return to but we may go back one day."}
{"text":"Very slow business, we waited 40 minutes and never received our food. The owner was too busy entertaining his family."}
{"text":"This is a really nice cuban restaurant. a few things to try are 1. Fritas 2. Fried Plantains 3. Chicken Entree 4.Cuban Sandwiches  The ambience is light and lively. Staff is great and the music is amazing! Felt like visiting Cuba after just having a meal here! Must go!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the food there. The Cuban steak sandwich is my favorite though I have not tried everything. But it's authentic"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this location from what we have read. Well that changed once we got there. We waited, and only we did, for 45 mins for a 2 person table when 10 people left while we were waiting. Once we were seated we were handed our menus but had to wait another 15 minutes. So we order everything at once just Incase. We received our sampler platter which was decent, but getting a refill was a bit hard. Once our meals arrived that was where we lost all excitement. The food was alright. Not much flavor. Once we finished we had to wave down a waiter at least 2 times to ask for our check, we had to finally grab another waiter for our check. They were not filled to capacity but seemed to be very short on staff. All and all not a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"We were really excited after seeing all the great reviews about the food to try this restaurant. On this night there was only one chef, 2  waiters. We ordered an appetizer and was then told it wasn't available and was suggested another only to be told that one wasn't available either. The meal I ordered was not available either. It seemed all the staples were not available. After about an hour and 15 minutes most of us received our food. The food was mediocre at best. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I have not gone to the actual restaurant but recently they cater to our company and the ropa vieja was great. It was saucy, the beef well cook and the beans and rice it just felt like it was an actual home cook meal. Definitely recommendable as they are great at what they do."}
{"text":"Kudos to this establishment.  Mojitos- amazing!  Service- 'spot-on'.  Décor/ambiance- very inviting.  Food- Amazing flavors, perfectly portioned, and so reasonably priced. The owner definitely knows how to operate a restaurant.  It's also obvious - that the staff takes as much pride in the restaurant - as the owner does. I know a place is special, when I feel like I've been taken to another part of the world, for a few hours.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was half decent, and the price was so so. Portion size left much to be desired, and the service was absolutely terribke."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Once every three or four months, I have to go to Concord, and that's always my \"stop by en route back home\" restaurant.  I like it much better than any of the Cuban restaurants in Charlotte including the one in Steele Creek and the one in Rock Hill.  That's saying a lot.  The place is spotless, the service is outstanding, and the food is the best -- for my tastes.  Will be going there today, and my mouth is already watering.  Ropa vieja, plantains, and empanadas are my favorites there."}
{"text":"My family has bee coming here for years. Very low key, casual. Great authentic food. Inexpensive and filling for sure. Perfect Cuban Press sandwich. Love this place."}
{"text":"Nice little spot to get your Cuban food fix. The ropa vieja was very good and spiced almost perfectly. It came with tostones the size of your hand and a nice portion of rice with black beans. The black beans were a little bland but it went good with the garlic sauce they served with it. My girlfriend got the Cuban and it was done right and tasted as good as it looked. The sangria was very refreshing and different too.  Definitely a homemade recipe. Will come back to try something else soon"}
{"text":"Had a bit of a hard time finding it as it is located inside a building, but so worth it! The Cuban sandwich was delicious! The plantains were sweet and the flan was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Rice and beans are authentic. Glad to find a restaurant that serves Cuban Cuisine, at reasonable prices. Latin music is a plus!"}
{"text":"Authentic Cuban fare and friendly service.  Tucked aware in the back side of an old downtown shopping center you can access from either Union or Church St.   Have eaten here a dozen times, usually getting the Cuban sandwich or other roasted pork delights. Plantains come sweet or green as a side. For a sugar high, the Cuban coffee is a potent little drink.  Really appreciate having this locally owned shop in my neighborhood"}
{"text":"The food was okay but not as good as NJ Cuban food. The server was courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very happy when we found this little place. However our last trip there didn't go well. We were celebrating our 11th Anniversary. I ordered the same thing I always order which is the roast chicken entree. When it came out it was clearly fried not roasted. Usually I can pull the skin off easily and the chicken under it is moist, tender and flavorful. This time it was clearly over cooked, dry and inedible. My husband went to talk to the manager. Clearly it was fried and I can't eat fried due to a health condition. She said it has always been roasted and then fried but perhaps it was over cooked. She didn't offer to remake it. Nothing. They also do not say they fry it on the menu which is a health concern for some people like myself. It's never looked fried before either. I couldn't eat it at all. We brought it home to give to our dog but it was so over cooked I couldn't get enough meat off of it. Because of this, I will never go back. You don't tell a customer that spends at least $40 each visit that perhaps it was cooked too much but then don't offer to fix it."}
{"text":"My visit here was an \"OK\" visit, the meal I had deserves a 2 or a 3 star but I gave the restaurant a 4 because I've been here before and actually had love enjoyed my food. This go around wasn't the case (unfortunately). Our server was quite awkward and didn't know much about the food (which he admitted to) he recommended us NOT to take any of the desserts to go because it would make a \"mess\", my food was not that great (went somewhere to get something to satisfy my hunger)... we would advise everyone to try them out and get their own experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great cafe con Leche.  Makes me think I'm back in Key West. I am glad the opened a second location the downtown gets too crowded."}
{"text":"I'm very impressed with the service we received here. I told them this was my father's 87th Birthday and they followed with a Great tasting 3 Leche cake with frosting. 3 of the staff came out with bongos and sang, very touching. Beautiful experience, my father said, \" He wants to come back next year\""}
{"text":"The best Latin food in concord N.C. Hands down . Being from New York and growing up in a Puerto Rican household I know what a good plate of rice beans taste like. The atmosphere A+ I felt like I was in my moms kitchen. They played almost every song I heard at home growing up. The staff was happy and polite. And the best thing over all the price of the food was my favorite thing . Portions were great. Overall I give this place a 5 star rating. And recommend anyone in the concord area to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Being 2nd generation Cuban, being raised with authentic Cuban food in Miami and knowing real Cuban food when I see (and taste it) this is as real as it gets. The food is to die for, you will not be disappointed. Their plantains, rice and beans and sandwiches are all fantastic. Try the congri with some boiled yuca. I purchased some Croquetas to bring home to my family all 12 of them didn't stand a chance. Looking for fresh Cuban bread? Done. Looking for tres leches amazing mind blowing dessert? Done. They even have a nice bar with tvs so you can watch the game (futball) This is my new go to place, because there's no comfort food like Cuban food :)"}
{"text":"One and done.  After 20 minutes we had barely been waited on and never received our drinks.  The restaurant was busy and hardly anyone had food on the table."}
