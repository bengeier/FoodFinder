{"text":"Order a soup, pho, chicken was not done was not happy with the results the next day, I was very sick. Definitely be careful for that. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant, everything was fresh, the staff was very polite. I had vegetable soup, vegetable egg roll, and home made vegetable pot stickers. They were delicious. Many menu options at an affordable price, very tasty."}
{"text":"Best hot and sour soup in Cleveland area! Consistent quality for the 25+ years that we have enjoyed the menu selections"}
{"text":"You know you went to a wrong Chinese place if it is located in a white neighborhood right next to a gas station"}
{"text":"Even though I live very close its not worth the drive here. The only things I've tasted that hold a candle to other places is their wonton soup and spring rolls. The teriyaki chicken is ok, except its all dark meat so most of it is not edible because of the fat. You stab your fork in a piece and five other pieces come with it because of the fatty connective tissues. There is a small Vietnamese menu and I tried the pho chicken soup. The chicken tasted like nothing it was really terrible. The cilantro comes already in the soup still on the vine which is gross to me. I would rather be able to tear off the leaf part myself. The honey garlic chicken was soggy when I tried that. All in all, I basically never eat there anymore which is a shame because I could walk there if I wanted to."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I've been going here for years. The owners are always friendly and the won ton soup is the best."}
{"text":"Ordered the vegetable curry, was not impressed or happy. The mushroom egg foo young was killer though, really enjoyed  my moms meal. The waitresses were pleasant and attentive. Egg rolls were delicious as well!  Probably wont go back, there's nothing special to me about this place."}
{"text":"Maybe not the best day for them.  Egg Foo Young was subpar. Soup great. Egg rolls and rice disappointment."}
{"text":"Got some takeout this weekend on our way to visit relatives.  Normally I wouldn't consider ordering blindly from someplace without seeing a menu (no website to be found), but my brother-in-law vouched for them and said it's good.  We ordered 3 entrees and a soup, and the bill came to about $25, which is pretty fair.  I saw on another review here that someone liked the Hunan Vegetables, so that's what I got.  They were pretty good.  My brother-in-law got the shrimp with lobster sauce, and my husband had general tso's chicken.  The hot and sour soup was probably the worst I've ever had.  Lots of sour, and no hot; plus it had some kind of meat in it, which was unpleasant and unexpected.  My biggest complaint is that they only gave us 1 pint of rice to share for 3 entrees.  Most other Chinese takeout places I've tried give you 1 pint of rice per entree.  It was definitely not enough.  I would give 1 star, but my husband loved his chicken."}
{"text":"I've been patronizing this establishment for 25 years. Always has great food...no matter what I order."}
{"text":"Mandarin House has been one of my FAVORITE places to get Chinese food in Cleveland for over 10 years.   The food is consistently fresh and delicious. Generous portions as you would expect from Chinese. The egg rolls are the best I've ever had and you can order vegetable ones with no problem.  Over the years they have been expanding their vegetarian menu to include tofu dishes such as Teriakyi tofu, Ma Po Tofu, and General Tsos.  The non-tofu vegetarian dishes have always been very good. My friends and family never complain. My veg faves are the Curry Vegetables, lots of chopped vegetables over a bed of rice noodles in a light curry sauce, and the Hunan vegetables, lots of chopped veggies in a brown hunan sauce with rice. They also also have great pad thai and egg foo young dishes and they have brown rice on the menu!  I can't say enough about the freshness and taste of the dishes compared to other chinese places. You get actual cut vegetables like broccoli, water chestnuts, carrots and bok choy. It's not just a lot of filler vegetables like onions and celery. The fried rice is fluffy not clumpy. The food is prepared to order. Presentation is always great.   The staff is always very friendly and attentive.  The prices are average for chinese food with some of the speciality items priced a little higher.  The place is clean and been redecorated in the last few years.  I took my Grandma Helen here for lunch. She is very picky about freshness and cleanliness and this place passed the test. (She ordered the chow mein and enjoyed it very much).   Bravo Mandarin House for a great meal again and again."}
{"text":"BEST WONTON SOUP! After eating theirs no other wonton soup will compare! Always super fresh and delicious! Their egg rolls are superb! Love the moo goo gui pan and sweet and sour chicken is always a hit!! Absolutely Delicious! Never had a bad tasting item from here! We've been enjoying their cuisine for over 12 years"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST sweet and sour chicken I have EVER had."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for over 20 years. You know how every family has its go-to Chinese restaurant and pizza place? This is ours (for Chinese at least). They have the best won-ton soup and pork fried rice to egg rolls to ribs and everything in between. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years.  It's consistently good, no matter what we order.   Tonight was the governors chicken, pho ga, vegetable lo mein, and chicken chop suey.   I wish there was a little more broccoli in the governors chicken, but I love the flavor. My dad always gets a large knowing I'll eat more than I should.    The egg rolls are fantastic, crispy, dictionary, and I love the sauce that comes with it.   It's all tasty, every time. Affordable and fast prep. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The food was below average. The Asian women is a little rude and messed up my order. Even after messing up my order, she charged me an additional 80 cents to make my meal spicy. The food lacks taste and it is bland.  Never coming here again. Please do not let the old reviews sway you into coming here!"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with Mandarin House. I've been coming here for 35 years and it's always consistent."}
{"text":"Not bad for close to home.  My only complaints are the egg rolls and spring rolls are lacking compared to King Wah, Center Ridge Rd. Almost nothing inside, not even cabbage. Also, the won ton soup does not have any meat in the noodle.  Otherwise the flavor of dishes we've ordered are very good. General Tso's chicken, sesame chicken, mandarin chicken, shrimp fried rice, ham fried rice, chicken egg foo young, beef and broccoli."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. Egg rolls, spring rolls, egg drop, Empress chicken, chicken with pea pods, kung pao - everything is done so well here. I am picky about Chinese restaurants, but this one has it all."}
{"text":"I returned and tried the pad thai with tofu for lunch. Very tasty, I'd definitely get it again! Huge portion!! Again, very quick service and friendly staff. Nice option very close to Tri-C's Parma campus."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by Mandarin house after reading some of its reviews on Yelp.  Something about the pictures reached out to me, what most reached out to me was the label Chinese & Vietnamese restaurant.  Chinese/Mandarin yes, Vietnamese I think not.  Some noodle soups, but I was desiring more options.  Vietnamese vegetable soup would've been delightful.  I love the atmosphere here.  Reminds me of an old favorite that is no longer open.  The egg rolls were fantastic.  The main dishes we had left a lot to be desired.  I had vegetable pad Thai .  I should've known to ask If egg was going to be in it.  It had a fairly foul smell but tasted ok.  The honey garlic chicken just didn't cut it.  I have to wonder if it's frozen or fresh when all of these places taste basically the same, and it aint so good. I'd be willing to give it another try. Hoping for something spectacular."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Mandarin house for over a decade. Family Owned and Operated... the best hidden little gem.. and now they have Bubble-Teas!"}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is the best I can come up with. The front of house is nice, clean, and well kept. The ice tea is so strong it could eat the paint off ships. The veggie egg roll was really good, The egg drop soup was \"meh\" and it appears they have no wontons. Just these odd square fish flavored crackers that sizzle when they hit hot soup and turn to mush. I had the sesame chicken and again, \"meh\". The other people in my party felt the same way. It's not bad, but also not memorable at all.  Oh, one last thing, the prices are very reasonable. That was above \"meh\"."}
{"text":"We have gone to this place for a couple of years,  Everything was fine until we found a dead bee in our food during our last visit.  Management subtracted 1 dinner from our check of four dinners.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Very good grilled pork. Actually I think the best I have ever had! Sandwich is great too"}
{"text":"We decided to try Mandarin House because we were tired of our usual Chinese meal. I was unimpressed with my meal. While I enjoyed the broth, the won tons in my won ton soup were doughy and did not have any meat inside. My garlic chicken was pale and flavorless. My egg roll was cool and had no meat inside as well. The duck sauce was cold and lumpy. The one thing I enjoyed was he fried rice but I wish it had more meat in it. I'd recommend skipping the Mandarin House. There are much better Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Parma!!!!! Plus they offer some pretty good Thai options as well. Everything I have tried there has been really good! The wonton soup is the only thing I need when I am not feeling well."}
{"text":"This place looks scary from the outside because it is in a run-down plaza, but it is my favorite sit-down Chinese food in Parma.  The chicken is always crispy and fresh and the sauces have good flavors. I do have to take a star away, though because their egg rolls are lacking in flavor and substance.  Otherwise, I have enjoyed everything I've ever gotten there!"}
{"text":"I usually hate ordering or going out for Chinese. I love Chinese food, but it seems that at most places it is not fresh, or it is loaded with a helping of MSG large enough to give me a headache for weeks. This is not true with Mandarin House. My boyfriend and I have been going here since we moved to Parma three years ago. We order the food when the mood strikes us, but we stop in to just pick up bubble tea at least a few times a month. The food is excellent, and their wonton soup is the best I've ever had. I'd recommend the beef chow fun: wide rice noodles, beef, soy, and bean sprout. It's a dish most Chinese restaurants in our area don't offer, but it is one of the best, and Mandarin House does it well.  Oh, and the bubble tea...get it! Always made fresh when you arrive, even if you order over the phone. There are so many flavors and options."}
{"text":"I can't write an objective review of this place. I've been coming here literally since before I could walk. The staff feel like family. I get takeout here almost every day when I'm in Cleveland now, and miss it terribly when I'm back in Chicago. I take quarts of won ton soup back with me! And to a previous reviewer, don't mind the one guy who speaks perfect English, it's just because the restaurant has been there for over 30 years."}
