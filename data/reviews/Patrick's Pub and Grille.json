{"text":"Great food and daily specials.  Love the selection of beers on tap. Wings are the best around."}
{"text":"my chicken salad was bland but his creamy Cajun chicken was awesome.  He got a salad with it that contained  2 hairs. The waitress said she would discount the bill then brought us the bill and it wasn't discounted so when I asked about it she got snippy. She discounted it $4 so I left her a $4 tip.  Would have left more if she wasn't so sneering."}
{"text":"Patrick's is a fun place to hang out.  Great beer selection and decent entertainment from time to time.  The food is so-so, the weekend breakfast is awful."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how anyone couldn't love this place! This is the first place I take family when they come in from out of town. I admit, at first glance, I wasn't sure what kind of place it would be. There is a convenience store area that shares space with the restaurant side. It's a bit odd at first, the idea of paying more than $10 to eat inside a convenience store. However, once inside and seated, it's actually a very nice atmosphere. Both the pub side and restaurant side have a cozy feel and are miles away from a dive.   And the food! If you like REAL French fries, this is the place to get them. I have yet to order something I didn't like. Whether you're getting a quick sandwich or a dinner entree, it's all delicious and generous portions. Lots of places claim to be an \"Irish Pub\" because they have a shamrock on their logo and the owner once had a connecting flight through Dublin. If you want authentic Irish food, there is no substitute for Patrick's Pub. That having been said, they don't force an Irish theme down your throat. No soccer hooligans here.   Along that line of thinking, they have beer aside from Guinness. Not only that, but Guinness isn't featured in every menu item. Their list of beers on tap is varied and ever changing. The shamrock sampler is a great way to taste a few without going broke or spending the night in county lockup. Plus, if you sample something you like, you can grab a six pack in their bottle shop before you go. Or, just use it as an excuse to go back to Patrick's Pub!"}
{"text":"Clean and simple. I travel 90% of the year for work thus 'forced' to eat out most meals, (my intro to Yelp so y'all know my reviews have some backing)...Ordered the Shep Pie for a hungover Sunday brunch. Not more than 5 people there at that time yet the meal took 30+ mins to roll out. Ya they actually cooked it fresh and it was great. Not a lamb/beef mix, all lamb and it wasn't ground up fine like most places. Lots of texture. If I were to fix up a Shep pie I would add some more veggies to the mix but nonetheless it shows that they weren't measuring meat on a scale and cooked it with love. I did like the shaved carrot touch to it, different and appreciated..Great service as well, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wear warm clothes because it is freezing cold in the dining area!  Service was very slow and it seemed like one waitress was doing pretty much everything.  At one point she spilled tea on herself and the floor when refilling it and just left the puddle on the floor.  Food was good though. I had the chicken salad with balsamic dressing.  It was large with a good portion of chicken and dressing was very good. My husband had the U boat sub and fries and really liked it."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for a leisurely, late lunch before the kids take over the house for the holidays.  We have been here for 2 years now, and I must say, I've always wanted to try this place.  Now that I have, I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner.  We both were in the mood for burgers and didn't have the time to drive to Robinson, so Patrick's was our choice.  We both ordered the Deluxe, with some tweeks, and were not let down.  I love the fact that there are 24 beers on tap (touches my craft beer heart) and that it has that local bar feel, but is not a dive.  Our waitress, Jessica, had complete control of the room and we didn't feel forgotten.  The menu has many appetizing meals, and I can't wait to try the Irish Nachos!"}
{"text":"Patrick's Pub is a great place that continues to get better so be ready for an update to 5 stars soon!!  This place has some great beer selections and they always keep it interesting. I am always open for trying something new, in the beer selection that is, and they fit the bill. They are always accommodating when it comes to whether or not you walk in with a group of friends or just your significant other. Always a fun time and a great place to meet up with friends and family!  The food isn't your typical bar  (fried) food and the selection is always interesting. If you like some fried foods in the form of wings then you won't be disappointed, they are always good and saucy!   I suggest giving them a try and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to chill and drink. The Daytona wings are excellent and the beer prices are really good."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has 4 stars. The food was mediocre at best. The table and floor were really sticky. The only good thing was the service."}
{"text":"Tried Patrick's for the first time today. Picked up a Ribeye sandwich. It was perfect. Not dry, very juicy. The fries were excellent. The man working there was very polite and thanked me for ordering lunch. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Patrick's has awesome food & mixed drinks! I definitely recommend their creamy cajun chicken pasta! TO DIE FOR! My boyfriend is a very picky eater but he loves sandwiches & he LOVES their U Boat subs! The food is always fantastic though, whatever we've gotten! Not a beer drinker but I've noticed they have a good variety for those that are! & They just recently opened their outdoor section which is really nice! A great place to hangout, have some drinks, &/or grab some food! Only downfall is that they are a tad pricey.... buut at least it's yummy, right?!"}
{"text":"We were here with another couple during the beer tasting (not why I was there).  I entered a different part of the restaurant (diner side) and was asked if I was here for the \"tasting\".  I explained I was meeting people for dinner, and the person walked away without helping me further.  I had to figure out that that bar was around the other side, as were the people I was meeting.  I would make this a 3-star review if we didn't have an awesome waiter/server.  He was seriously kick-ass!  Our appetizer (the reuben poppers) was mixed up and the reuben dip came out instead.  They immediately apologized and we instead opted to eat it, and are glad we did!  It was amazing!  The actual sandwich looked delicious, but I had the shepherd's pie--which arrived fresh out of the oven.  We also enjoyed the tips nachos (I can't remember what they are called, but they were the ends of a rack of ribs on nachos)--seriously, do it. The seasoning was great--it was homemade mashed potatoes, rather than the fake stuff.  The desserts, however, left a lot to be desired.  Overpriced for small portions, which our server warned us about.  Really, not worth the $$ and a disappointing end to the night.  Service (once in the bar part) was A+ and beer selections were great.  We will be coming back, even if it's a 45 minute drive."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood pub!  I've been to Patrick's many times and the food is always great! The service is fantastic! What more could you want? Love the Daytona wings, the Irish nachos and my husband loves the Rueben bites! A large beer selection on tap!   Wish the bar was bigger!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place!  Food is fantastic!  I have never had a bad meal here. They also have specials every day and cater. Draft selection is fantastic and always changing. Fun to try new beers. Staff is extremely friendly and efficient.  They always \"on.\"  A ton of TVs to watch your favorite teams. There is a separate dining room which is family friendly. Go out and support your local pub!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service. Excellent selection of craft beers. I have eaten here many times. Best grilled cheese anywhere."}
{"text":"Each time that I travel into town to visit family, we usually end up at Patrick's, dining in for at least one meal.  Each previous experience has been at least 4 star, with atmosphere, quality of food and waitstaff experience. During this, our most recent trip, we opted to order carry out, and I hope our experience was an aberration and not a sign of changes to come.  On Wednesday evening, 27Sep17, we ordered: - Pierogies, while tasting good, were absolutely swimming in butter or similar product. - Wings that were a bit overdone (crispy) and dry. - A side salad was missing. - A Chicken Fiesta Wrap that was far more vegetables than chicken, despite the description including chicken breast. - A Chicken Devonshire entree that was, based on description, to include chicken breast.  I was sadly disappointed to find what appeared to be sliced deli chicken instead of chicken breast. Had we not been so involved with, and exhausted by, a funeral this time, I would have followed up with the restaurant directly."}
{"text":"A friend of mine & I stopped for a bite to eat and since I'm on my quest for the best fish in the burgh I ordered the fish sandwich.  I prefer the beer batter vs. breaded but ordered it anyway.  It was a good size portion for the price.  The fries were advertised as fresh cut... I was expecting Kenneywood type fries these were not. They didn't have the flavor nor the straight edge cut of fresh cut even though they were spiced up with season salt.   My friend ordered the turkey open face sandwich with mashed potatoes.  The potatoes were real mashed, the turkey had beef gravy on it vs. a turkey or poultry gravy. When I asked how was it, the response was alright.  The waitress was nice and doing a great job since she was the only one working the dinning room.  A once upon a time 7eleven is now the dining room so it's new construction, clean & bright."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of meeting friends at Patricks. We were able to enjoy the new patio addition, and it was wonderful. Not only was the atmosphere beautiful and relaxing, but our bar tender/server Danae was absolutely AMAZING. She was not only sweet her talents in bar tending, and serving were simply OUTSTANDING. She made multi tasking look easy. You go Danae I hope you're a manager because you certainly deserve such a position.  Tina"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and each was very good. Most recently we got the turkey club and the triple decker Reuben, and we'd get both again. Good selection of beer. Clean, well kept, and good service."}
{"text":"I only wish I lived closer to Patrick's.  The food is outstanding.  The stew is excellent, the steak and egg sandwich is great, hot roast beef is perfect.  I've never had a bad meal at Patrick's.  Service has always been outstanding as well.  Excellent rotations for beers on draft.  This is an off the beaten path type bar but you will be glad you stopped by.  It's excellent!"}
{"text":"Welp, I said I'd try again this time dine-in, and I'm so glad I did.  Everything from the apps, to the perfectly cold beer, main courses, and children's selections were on point.    Based on my previous review, the owner reached out, offered reasonable explanations for the not so finer points of our last experience, and even offered gift certificates for us to try again.  I declined the gift certificates and tried again, and I'm so glad I did.  I'll gladly pay full price for the food & service we got on our 2nd go-round.    I was very impressed that Shawn, the owner, reached out personally and remedied the situation.  It feels like the customer is more of a pain than an asset to most businesses anymore, and this showed us that this business actually DOES care.  An example of how to turn a not so great experience into customer loyalty.  The peace of mind that comes with knowing we'll get what we paid for goes a long way."}
{"text":"Good and service is always exceptional. We stop in at least once a week. Favorites are the Monterey Chicken Wrap and Guinness Stew. Great place!"}
{"text":"So, walking into this place, I was pretty mad at the hubby for picking it. I mean, there is a lottery/cigarette shop in the restaurant. It looks like a dive. But, I'll try most anything once so we went for it.   Color me surprised! It was BOGO wing night, so we got that and salads (I am eating chicken again after years of being a veg, so I am pretty picky about what chicken I eat). The wings were far beyond my expectation. I got the melting pot sauce, which is a bit of everything plus a side of super hot. Both were really good. Melting pot is just not spicy enough for me, but my hubby really liked it. He got garlic parm, which was too boring for me, but again he likes stuff like that and ate all of his wings in 1/2 the time it took me, so needless to say, he thought they were perfect. The salads were also good, but basic.   Service was attentive and friendly. No complaints about anything!"}
{"text":"Waited for a hostess for so long, we decided to just sit at the bar. Apparently they were preparing for a party, but in the mean time decided to ignore the many customers waiting at the hostess stand to be sat. But once we got served the bartenders were friendly and accommodating. Food was decent! I would have gave them a 3.5 if it was possible."}
{"text":"Good food and great beer selection. Always a great experience. Love coming here for dinner. Bartenders are awesome too."}
{"text":"Had some type of chicken wrap.  Came out piping hot, tasty, but most of the chicken was on one side.  Neither of us cared for the fresh fries.  Husband not impressed with the Reuben.  Server nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Great service, great food... large portions.  Breakfast on the weekends isn't bad, love the pasta."}
{"text":"Went back to Patrick's pub today to try the food! I'm actually impressed! We ordered the steamed mussels in the garlic wine sauce.  They were really tasty and only $9! I ordered the salmon BLT. It was only $10 and I was given a pretty big piece of salmon and a side of the best French fries I have ever had. They had done sort of spicy seasoning on them that was to die for. Totally ruined my diet. Great beer selection! The only thing I can say about this place that is negative is that they gave my friend the wrong side dish... But after tasting what they did give her she didn't mind at all."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while in town for a college tour at Pitt.  Delicious home made food in large portions at fair prices with an impressive draft list featuring some local favorites and high quality craft offerings from around the country.  Service was homey and super friendly.  It had a country kitchen vibe that I didnt expect,  but appreciated, as I had three high school seniors in tow.  Less bary, more restauranty.  About four mile drive from the airport Sheraton.  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Amazing pub food and service was excellent. The chicken wings and burgers are top notch."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I had a few hours to kill before our flight so we decided to stop by for lunch. This is a neighborhood pub/convenient store and it wasn't the easiest place to get from from Wexford. We got there around 12:45pm and there were only 4 people in there including us. I ordered the Guinness Beef Stew (available in a cup/bowl or dinner portion) and my friend ordered the fish and chips. The stew was very good with great flavor; meat, potatoes and carrots were tender. I had a bite of the fish ... the cod was fresh (no fishy smell). The batter was thin and I think it's more like a corn meal or something. It was a little salty for my taste but not bad.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive. We told her that we were catching a flight and she was extremely accommodating.   I'd probably wouldn't go back because it's a bit out of our way."}
{"text":"Well, I should probably cast in my two cents for Patrick's since I've been here three times now.  As others have said, I came across Patrick's in a Yelp search, and as usual, I wasn't let down.  There is a sit-down restaurant part, and then a pub in the back.  You can get food and beer in either one, so it's really up to what kind of atmosphere you're looking for, and whether you've got kiddos in your party.  The first time my boyfriend and I came here, we opted for a sit down dinner before heading into the pub to play darts and pool.  I ordered the bangers and mash, and he the cottage pie.  I wanted to bury my face in the mash.  Actually, it's the gravy that really  makes that dish.  Bangers were proper bangin' themselves, but oh man, that brown gravy...!  The cottage pie was solid, but we agreed that I had the top notch dish.  They have a proper nice dart board, although it is rather awkwardly placed between the bar and the bathrooms, so we had to stop often to let folks pass.  Then we settled in for a couple rounds of pool.  The table seems steady and level, and there are a fair amount of pool cues of varying lengths.  A game costs 4 quarters, and it's easy to get change at the bar.  Our second visit was to kill some time on Super Bowl Sunday before going to a friend's house to watch the game.  This time we just had a few beers, a sampler platter appetizer, and played pool.  Everything tasted well, however, all that fried food sat heavy with me for the rest of the night.  It wasn't like it was overly greasy or anything, so that could just be me.  The most recent visit was a double date with friends, and we did pretty much all of the above: me with my giant platter of bangers and mash wishing I could swim in the gravy, an Irish nachos appetizer, beers, darts, pool, and this time we even jumped on the juke box.  We had a really great evening.  It was plenty busy, but not so crowded that we couldn't enjoy ourselves.  I should also mention that in all of these visits, the staff are all super friendly.  Not fake friendly, just consistently amiable, from servers to bartenders.  My boyfriend and friend even sat down and chatted with the owner for a bit while my friend's husband and I got  engrossed in a game of pool.  The fellow patrons are a decent crowd too.  This is in a rather tucked away place, so it's mostly locals who are there to meet up with friends, watch a game, etc.  I think I can safely say that Patricks is definitely one of our go-to spots."}
{"text":"Patrick's Pub is a family favorite! Their wings are crispy and the sauces are great (Daytona is amazing!) my husband has tried several things and hasn't been disappointed. My only qualm is the overpricing of some items (like $4 to add bacon to cheese fries). The restaurant is super casual which is perfect for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Holy smokes, what is happening to this place?  Just within the last few months, prices have gone up and quality has gone down. Sunday night we went in for wings and they were the smallest wings that I have ever seen. Not sure where they can find chickens that small."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I was referred to Patrick's pub by a friend and I'm so glad I tried it out. They have a great bar with pool tables so Wednesday nights that's where we go to drink and shoot pool. They have a good selection of beers and specials. I will say I'm happy I tried the food. The Philly cheesesteak with the beer cheese sauce and house cut fries was very good. The ranch I got on the side to dip the fries in was very good and fresh, it definitely was not the same old instant packet hidden valley ranch that I find at most places locally. The service was nice and friendly. They really care about their customers, a few people ahead of me at the counter made my pick-up order that night a few minutes longer than I had liked, but that's okay guests in house take priority and I understand that. They politely thanked me for my patience and gave me good service and that's all I ask for. I definitely will recommend you give this place a shot because you will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Got a burger that was recommended by the waitress and it was amazing, not to mention the French fries were awesome too. The roast beef sandwich was a bit dry, but was good. Would recommend it and would probably go back. Great atmosphere, service was good. Not great. But good."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area working and we read the reviews on yelp and decided to check this place out.   Our waiter was very nice and attentive. I got the chicken wrap with fries and it was delicious. If I wasn't on my lunch break I would have gotten a beer because they have a great variety and it seems like the place to hang out after work."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beers in the pub rates this 5 stars.  Service?  Meh. So gave 4 stars"}
{"text":"Irish Nachos are yummy!  I really enjoyed this place.   I went to lunch with a coworker.    They had a pretty good menu with lots of options.   I decided to order the Irish Nachos and the special (Open Face Cajun Prime Rib Sandwich)  The Irish Nachos were potato waffle fries, tomatoes, onions, etc... - they were surprisingly good.  The sandwich was good as well.   I replaced the fries with Irish red potatoes which offered a better compliment for me.  I will include this in my happy hour rotation because they appear to have a good beer selection.  This place is close to work, so I am sure I will be a regular :-)  Price:  Lunch $5 - 10 per meal. Food:  Very tasty and good portions. Atmosphere:   This place feels and acts like a pub.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Patrick's Pub, oh how I love you so!!  The best bar in Moon twp. I enjoy myself every time I am there. I loved working there and will never forget my experience and memories that were made.  This bar is my favorite of all time! No other bar compares, and I will always come back time and time again!"}
{"text":"I've been back multiple times and have been pleased so I'm changing my rating. The cheese fries are yummy. The boneless wings are good but I wish they had more wing flavors. The beef and cheddar is good but not mind blowing. My favorite is still the Cajun chicken pasta and I just tried the chicken tender sandwich.   Large beer list which I love."}
{"text":"Another of my usual spots.    Everything I've ever ate here was excellent.   They even have breakfast on the weekends!  If your into craft beers, this is your place as well.   They have quite a few taps, and the craft beers greatly outnumber the mainstream c&@p stuff."}
{"text":"What a great little neighborhood pub topped off with great Irish themed bar food! There is nothing fancy about the appearances of this place. It is very casual and actually divey. The staff though were all super friendly and efficient. There is a diner style side suitable for families with a takeout counter, and then a sports bar side. I believe the menus are pretty much the same. The prices were right and the food was homemade.   We had the fresh cut fries, a burger, wings and tasted the Reuben fritters. The fritters were unique where the inside was the Rueben ingredients ground together into a consistency of a liverwurst sausage, breaded and deep fried. It was served with a mustard sauce and a thousand island dressing. They were interesting, but not sure I'd get them again. The burger was ordered medium but came out well done. The patty itself though had great flavor and didn't disappoint. The wings were good sized, meaty and cooked to a nice crispy skin. The flavor of the Daytona sauce was excellent! The fries were perfect... as expected in an Irish pub!  This is a great casual spot for a beer and a bite, enjoy!"}
{"text":"So I wish I could give 3.5 stars but I'm rounding down since that's not possible.   I've eaten here 4 times. 2 were great! The first time I had the Cajun chicken alfredo it was amazing!!! The service here has always been good and I love the beer flights in the clover shaped serving blocks. The other time I had the burger then comes in between a grilled cheese....I'm not sure what it's called but it's wonderful! My boyfriend got this once and then later on we both got it and all 3 burgers from there were excellent.  I've also had a few good bloody Mary's here as well and the bartenders are friendly and competent. I'd give the atmosphere in the bar area 4/5 stars as well.    The other 2 times....well, I'm not sure if they have changed kitchen staff but the 2nd time I got the very same Cajun Alfredo (about 3 months after the first time) it was cold, tasted terrible, and had no kick to it. There's no way it was the same recipe that I had the first time, and I was so disappointed in the result that I'm afraid to try it again. I also came during breakfast hours once and ordered a quesadilla.  When this arrived the bottom of the plate was covered in water like someone had knocked a glass over on it but decided to serve it anyway, and I ended up with a soggy mess that was not edible.   Bottom line I guess is that when it's good, it's really good!  When it's bad, it's very bad. :( that makes it hard to write a solid review. They do have a good beer selection here and I will be back. Hopefully next time will be one of the better times! The"}
{"text":"Found this pub on Yelp reviews. In town for a few days looking for a cool place for dinner and drink a beer. Patrick's was just what we were looking for. Clean, good beer selection.  TVs with a variety of sports.  Our waitress was the best I have ever had.  I am so sorry I didn't get her name.  She gave great advice about the food and it was delish. Chicken tender sandwich with honey BBQ was just enough not too sweet. Not a French fry fan but they were very good. My husband got an Irish chicken dish with mashed potatoes and gravy superb!!  Price was great for the amount of food.  You could tell locals hang out there.  Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Pub is located in the burbs of the burbs in the far ends of moon straddling Hopewell. I cam here with a friend on a Wednesday. I had been wanting to go for some time.. had a classic wood constructed  Irish pub feel inside with TVs all around.   The crowd was understandably a little older and the prices for pints were a little more- but the food was reasonable- no different than anywhere else. I got the classic patricks pub burgher and my friend and i got the Irish Nachos.. They didnt have the right potato wedge fries for the nachos and were very apologetic but we got them with normal fries anyway- and it was delicious still- yet it would have been nicer with circular wedge fries.  The burger was good a little small for the two pieces of bread they gave me but it tasted fine.   Selection was good, restaurant was clean, and service was exceptional.   Pretty nice little pub. I would return."}
{"text":"Patrick's Pub is a well kept secret. The food is awesome and portions are extremely generous! My favorite is the steak salad that I absolutely love! Try Patrick's for a great meal at a great deal!"}
{"text":"If it's 1am and you're starving....come here. Yummy midnight food cravings. Also a nice place for happy hour and meeting up with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing Irish fries! Literally the best thing there! It's a lot of carbs but definitely worth it at least once. It's also great to share for a group."}
{"text":"The food was typical bar food nothing great. The wait staff was less than friendly almost irritated at times  Probably wouldn't recommend or go back.  I could get more specific. But it wouldn't be very nice. The atmosphere was dark and drab and way too many TVs.  \"If you can't say something ice don't say nothing at all. \""}
{"text":"I'm making this place my tradition when I visit Pittsburgh. Close to the airport, this pub makes for a great waiting spot for travelers. The beer list is intentional and varied, the oak bar harkens tradition, and the variety of wing sauces and rubs is reason enough to hang out to closing time."}
{"text":"Whenever we go to a new place we always like to order the wings.  We moved away from the city last summer so unfortunately we can't make the trip to our favorite place in the South Side as often as we want.  A lot of places advertise \"jumbo wings\".  This place literally has the largest wings I have ever had.  I can't quite remember the flavor of sauces we had but they were surprisingly not greasy in any way.  Safe to say it's my new favorite wing spot.  Besides, any place that has flavored vodka for under four bucks, I'm there!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!    Great service, yummy homemade meatloaf and mashed potatoes, reasonable prices.  Perfect dinner for a chilly winter evening.  They are in the midst of a remodel/expansion - the place is looking spiffy too!"}
{"text":"Great Reuben fritters, and the Patrick's Long Islands were great! And the staff are fantastic! Great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Great place for wings and beer.  The server was nice and friendly.  The place was definitely a \"bar\" atmosphere.  Great for tweens and up."}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Patrick's for 3 years and we love the food, staff and atmosphere.  Wednesdays kareokee is lead by an amazing couple. :)"}
{"text":"Man what an unexpected gem this place was!!  I was invited to a beer tasting meetup group by a friend while was in town on business. It was a bit of a drive for me to get there, but when I arrived I was nervous. It definitely looks divey.  But I just had a fantastic night! I started off with the beer cheese and pretzels. I am a sucker for soft, warm pretzels and beer and this was without a doubt the best cheese sauce I had ever had. It was made with a vanilla porter, which I know, doesn't sound great, but it was really beyond amazeballs.   I had the chicken philly, which was godzilla sized for a very reasonable price and quite tasty.   Beer list was solid with a mixture of crowd pleasing domestics as well as local beers for beer nerds like me who are always on the hunt for local beers.   The best part of the evening was the staff. They were just spectacular! Friendly and accommodating. My college basketball team was on the tube, but I didn't want to drive back to hotel as I would miss the end of a very tight game. The head waitress let me stand and watch the rest of my game while she finished cleaning and stacking chairs in the restaurant.   I will be back!!"}
{"text":"First visit.  Great interior, great food.  We'll be back!  The service was great and it's a huge venue I really liked the variety of food there. Shout out to Shannon our waitress!  Best service of any place I've been.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A great place for good beer and great Irish fare. The bartenders are awesome, especially Greg and Michelle.   We probably stop at Patrick's once a week, and have never had a bad experience.   Oh yes, trivia on Friday night is a blast!!"}
{"text":"We've heard that Patrick's is good and wanted to try it.  I wasn't disappointed and I'll be back often!  We started with the fried zucchini.  It was just ok.  A little undercooked and greasy, but not bad.  My wife got the hand breaded fish sandwich and she said it was excellent.  I had the triple decker Ruben sandwich and it was great!  Both came with fresh cut fries that were probably the best I've ever had.  Our server was fantastic and made us feel welcome.  I'm axious to try one of their burgers!"}
{"text":"I have come to this establishment a lot since I lived close by growing up. I really want enjoy their grilled cheeseburger! Unfortunately there consistency is a little off. I hadn't eaten there in a while and when I returned with my family I was less than satisfied. One member of our party had ordered a steak. Me and the rest of our party got our food while his steak still wasn't there. Apparently the steak had been over cooked and a new one was on. Even though multiply employees apologized it still was a little annoying to wait for 20 minutes for a steak when other members of the party were already served. When the meal arrived, the steak was much fatter than the last time and drenched in whole peppercorn. I was disappointed when the dish was not comped. As much as I like Patricks growing up I would hesitate to return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went out on a limb and tried this place based on the yelp reviews... It was kind of late so it was awesome the kitchen was open late. The beer selection is awesome and many different beers I haven't seen before on tap normally. We had chips and salsa and potato skins for an appetizer. Both were so yummy, salsa was home made and the chips were served warm, the potato skins were nice and cheesy just the way I like em! For our dinner we shared the fish sandwich and crab cake, both served on a nicely toasted bun and were just really delicious. Our server Danielle was nice and very attentive, she was great! This seemed like such a nice neighborhood spot! Def try if you're in the area :) !!!"}
{"text":"Good food! Best Rueben You will find. Definitely try it. Great rotating craft beer list keeps us coming back to! I would highly recommend this place. There is a bar side and a restaurant side. Both non smoking. Breakfast was delicious too. I have also never had bad service here. Will keep coming back for the food staff and beer. Keep it up patricks pub."}
{"text":"I visited here a couple of times for lunch and it is a nice, laid back atmosphere. The service was quick and the hamburger I ordered was delicious. When we were there, they had been filming for something and asked us to be in the background for it. It was a fun way to spend lunch."}
{"text":"Nice corner bar with great food!  They really try to keep the food a little higher scale than normal bar food.  Many of their dinner specials are amazing, but they sell out fast!"}
{"text":"A place that has stood the test of time with great memories, beer, and pirogies!  Its a great place to reconnect and unwind. Staff is authentic and the location is quaint. Highly recommend if yr near the pittsburgh or around the area."}
{"text":"Having a great time before getting on the plane heading back to SoCal. Kellie is such a great bartender with a fantastic laugh. She engages with patrons as if we're family. Trust me, don't go to the airport bar when you have time before your flight. It's close, the food is amazing and why sit in an airport when you can have an experience. Patrick's is our MUST when we arrive or take-off from now on."}
{"text":"Well this is just a really quaint establishment  . Created from the old Stop and Go up here by the elementary school and housing plans . Great community gathering area  !"}
{"text":"Updating my previous review. This time I am giving Patrick's 4 stars instead of three because of the excellent customer service this time around. The waiter we had last time wasn't as friendly as the waitress this time! She was very pleasant and quick to service our every need.  I've been on a chili kick recently and decided to give theirs a try. It was pretty tasty and spicy just the way I like it, however, it was a little luke warm instead of hot which was a turn off. The chicken wrap I had though was excellent as usual.  I am going to quote my last review because I still love this aspect about the place - One thing I loved about this place were the aesthetics and ambiance. This place has that old town pub feel, but well kept and clean. The upbeat music, televisions easily seen around the bar, and the mix of young adult and older adult crowd gave this place an exciting yet homey experience."}
{"text":"Highly recommend and we found this place thru the Yelp app! My group flew into Pittsburgh for business travel and we wanted something close to the airport. It's a small place but was neat and clean! It has lots of TVs for watching sports! Pete the bartender waited on us and he was awesome! Pete suggested the Irish menu and everyone in my party tried a Irish dish! The Irish nachos were great and I had the Banger Sandwich! The banger is a Irish sausage on a toasted bun and it was awesome! Another member had the Reuben and it was huge and he said it was awesome as well! The portions are huge and everything tasted great! Everyone in party loved this place and I would highly recommend if you are close by!"}
{"text":"We discovered Patrick's sort of by accident (in the area + starving + Google Maps \"near me\") ... and we were ever-so-pleased we did. The menu is pretty extensive: a variety of appetizers, sandwiches, dinner entrées - including traditional Irish dishes, and lots of beer options, if that's your thing. (By the way, beer is decidedly _not_ my thing ... but they had a lovely cider on tap.  :)  )  I had a bit of a time deciding what to order; so much sounded so good. I went with the creamy Cajun chicken, and it was _wonderful_. (And generously portioned; it'll be dinner tomorrow too.) The Fella had the cottage pie and was awfully pleased too. We also had cups of the Guinness stew and the chili - yum.   The waitress was very pleasant and knowledgeable. We were not surprised to hear that everything is homemade ... it's obvious. She was happy to give her opinions on menu items, and didn't blink an eye at odd requests. The prices were very reasonable - perhaps even cheap, considering the quality of the food.  We were on the restaurant side, but there's apparently a pub side too. They also appear to do a brisk pick-up business too.  Overall, we were jazzed, and we'll find regular excuses to head back. (It's unfortunately 40 minutes away.)"}
{"text":"Patrick's Pub is a wonderful neighborhood pub.  It is the winner of the 2013 Reubenoff which determined the best reuben sandwich in the tri-state area. ( perhaps the world). The grilled chicken salad is tremendous as is the Irish nachos. The pub's decor is inviting and the staff is delightful."}
{"text":"On a business trip,  so I tried a local dive before bed.  Not terrible.  The wings were well cooked but the quality of the chicken was below average.  The rueben sandwich was dry,  which hard to do with a rueben.    Again,  not terrible when it's 10:40 pm on a Wednesday."}
