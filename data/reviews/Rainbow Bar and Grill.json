{"text":"ok music cute bartender and a stiff drink check. The people watching here is awesome I seem to end up here with friends not by choice but the night ends well and all is drunk. Reminds of the LA thing to do though...."}
{"text":"I've been trying to yelp this place - but yelp kept crashing. Arrrggh so this is probably my 5th time in hopes it doesn't crash . Dont worry. I'll copy correctly this time. 
I love Rock Bars....this is one of the few rock bars in Vegas. This place isn't like the LA one. But the food is pretty close. It's italian american flair. They've got the Margharita Pizza, pisghetti, sausage and peppers, to bar foods like wings and nachos. I've always had a good time here. I even had a superbowl party here. I like the staff, they're usually pretty friendly and they're all pretty hot. Except for one older woman. She's probably like the mom or something. Tall brunette cocktail server....tattoos....yea she likes to be bit. She told me - she had marks from her boyfriend. NOW THAT'S THE KINDA BARS I LIKE!!!
Drinks are average. Went to a couple open bars here. This is definitely one of thos late night off the strip places. Right next to Club Paradise - across from Hard Rock Hotel, it's prime location to relive your hair metal days. Yes....Come to Rainbow, have a drink...then trash your hotel room. Now that's Rock....."}
