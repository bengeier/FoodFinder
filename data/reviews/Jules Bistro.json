{"text":"Let me just dive right into it. Terrible food and horrible service.

I took a group of friends and it took them 45 mins to even come around to take our drink orders. We ask for a bottle of white that they have listed up on the chalk wall and our waiter tells us that its better we order from the menu cos the wine list up on the chalk board is there to look pretty and they might not have those wines.

They then run out of wine glasses by the time we get around to ordering our second wine bottle ( i would have thought you could do 8 rounds of dishes in the time they made us wait for the wine, apparently putting out 9 clean glasses is more work than I thought).

The waiter finally comes to take our order and informs us they they dont have any sandwiches. We put in our order and when the food finally arrives, they have get the wrong dish for one person and forget one order completely.

The french onion soup arrives and it does not even look like French onion soup, forget taste like one. My friend and I order the grilled salmon. Both of us get an over salted morsel of fish. I somehow get a salad and he gets just fries. My other friend, who orders the chicken, gets fries and salad with his chicken and another just gets chicken and salad. The chicken was dry and chewy and we had to wait for 10 mins to get get salt and pepper for the table.

Not once during the entire meal did someone come to our table to check on us and ask us how the food was (they probably knew) and we had to threaten to walk out before someone even came to take our dessert orders, which we just had to give up on when they hadn't arrived till 11:45.

In conclusion. Terrible food and horrible service. Never going back there."}
{"text":"Yet another superb lunch spot in this area of the city. I am lucky to work at Adelaide and Spadina, we are spoiled for options!

Colleagues took me here for my birthday lunch last week, it was my second time at Jules and both have been very enjoyable. 

The staff are very friendly and without a reservation, seated us right away. If you're a bigger group, aim to go around 11:30 because it did pick up. I had the spinach and goat cheese quiche with salad, it is such a satisfying lunch. The pastry on the quiche is dynamite and there was an abundance of spinach and cheese in the filling. 

Worth mentioning they will allow 1/2 salad and 1/2 fries on the side at Jules! One of my colleagues had the burger medium-rare and it looked delicious, they clearly use a high quality beef. We all enjoyed our meals thoroughly.

My husband raves about the steak frites here, it is a bit much for me to order at lunch but it seems very popular so it must be good! 

Nice bistro lunch, slightly fancy compared to the other spots around here."}
{"text":"Don't get the prix fixe - go for the Cote de Boeuf!

Been here 3 times - cote de boeuf for 2 has consistently been juicy and tasty. The last time it was bit over salted. However, one of the better steaks in Toronto - almost as good as an Australian steak! :p Avoid the cheaper cuts of steak - they're no good.

I've had the onion soup (average), warm goats cheese salad (slightly better than average)  ... pretty much everything else is average.

Most recently I had the tart tartin - it was below average, puff pastry was dry and burnt - and probably a few days old. Creme brûlée was better than average.

Atmosphere is great - quite noisy and service can be a little slow. However, the service has always been sincere and friendly so a little tardiness can be forgiven. Reasonably priced - $40/person."}
{"text":"Tucked at the end, in a row of commercialized joints including Subway and Fresh, lies one of the coziest, most quaint restaurants in the city. Jules is as French as you can get.
From the energetic chef/owner who seems to dance in the open kitchen - between shaking hands and sometimes hugging his guests - to the white-washed decor, communal tables and decorative chandeliers, this place whispers sweet somethings of Provence and Bordeaux. 
The menu is simple - quiches, crepes, croque monsieurs. But there are a few special items that embrace their North American assimilation - yet maintain that French je ne sais quoi. The Arrogant Burger is my all time favourite meal - and I order it every time since first trying it. Ground beef made-to-order, brie, caramelized onion, lettuce, gerkin and tomato on a square, soft ciabatta-like roll. Served with shoestring frites - or your choice of half-and-half: fries and salad...it's a piece of France in your mouth.
Lunches are super busy...service can sometimes be slow. But the food and ambience make up for what would otherwise be a frustrating wait.
They've just introduced a daily special: steak and frites from 4-6pm are just $12.50.
Overall, Jules doesn't disappoint and will keep me coming back...especially because it's just 2 minutes from both my house and my office!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Food probably gets a 3.5, salmon tartare was good but not spectacular. Overall a good solid choice for a relaxed night out.

The owner is a real crowd pleaser. Will be back to try the lamb rack, looked really good."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, it was a pleasant atmosphere - a little bit crowded but the noise level was comfortable for conversations (not too quiet that everyone can hear you nor too loud that you have to shout).

What stood out to me was the food arrived pretty quickly compared to other sit-down restaurants, which was much appreciated during lunch hour. Service was good and fast. They give you a jar of water to refill yourself, and were prompt to give you another jar when you're running low.

I ordered the Ratatouille / Goat Cheese quiche, I must say it is one of the best quiches I've had in a while. Not too cheesy or heavy, lots of taste, just delicious. I will admit that their fries are nothing special.

The creme brulee was perfect - not too sweet and very smooth. The only reason it didn't get a 5 star is because the desserts (in my opinion) cost a little too much (the creme brulee was $8). The rest of the menu was fine, my quiche was $16, their sandwiches were $12 and other entrees were around $16 to $19."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant near the corner of Queen and Spadina. It's a French restaurant. They have a very nice steak frites dinner. I've tried it about five times and it's always cooked right, and the fries are very good.

It's one of these \"neighborhoody\" places that's right in the middle of everything. The prices are quite reasonable, me thinks. I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my meal here, in fact everyone is my party was.  I pass by it all the time and had been looking forward to trying it for a while especially with all the great reviews.  The french onion soup was awful... our waitress tried to discourage me from ordering it but I persisted.. I should've taken her advice.  It was broth with some croutons, essentially raw onions, and some shreds of mozzarella. Not recommended!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time on a weekday lunch. Surprisingly, the place wasn't bustling and I was able to get a table for 6 people right away. 

I ordered what our server recommended: the Club Sandwich accompanied with fries and salad. TIP: You can choose both sides if you ask your server to do half half. ( I liked the idea of this).

It didn't take too long to get our food but the Club Sandwich was rather disappointing. Chicken was dry and there was nothing special about it. Fries were skinny fries and didn't amaze me. They could've chosen a better dressing for the salad too. No one at my table was amazed with their food, although our server was attentive and super friendly! 

Overall, Jules didn't meet my expectations and probably wouldn't come back here for lunch."}
{"text":"If one can get past the abysmal acoustics, the charm and energy of this sweet little spot is undeniable. Shabby Parisienne chic and downtown Toronto verve make the lively ambiance, sincere service and yummy cuisine a fun and memorable date night or group outing."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant on a Friday evening. First, the waiter forgot to tell that they had no more bread to make sandwiches after We had been spending 15 minutes to choose our dishes. The kind of info you tell before choosing!!!! 
After that, we go for a chicken crepe with French fries for around 14$. French fries were McDonald's level. Crepe. What can we say?! The cooker probably don't know what are salt, pepper and spices. Absolutely untasteful. 
Bref, we just ate as fast as possible in order to head to our movie cinema night. It looks like people just start food business because it is trendy and fun. Very far from my old real French bistro I used to go for the price, quality and service."}
{"text":"Walked by Jules Bistro around lunchtime on way to an afternoon appointment and it smelled so good. I knew I had to try this place for dinner.  So glad I did. Food was so tasty! The staff was also very nice. Perfect wine recommendation for my dinner. I was solo on business and sat right at the open kitchen bar where I was able to chat up the staff.  Only bummer was they don't accept AMEX and that's what my corporate card is. I will definitely be coming here again next time in town."}
{"text":"Three years, countless steak frites dinners, glasses of red wine and lemons tarts qualifies me as a Jules Bistro devotee. And why not? The steak frites has always been served exactly, perfectly medium-rare, the staff is gregarious, welcoming, and kind (even when they are extremely busy) and I have never felt rushed to finish my food. Plus, I admit, I love that that the owner, Eric, has \"NO PHONES\" scrawled on the board. Finally, some real passion, personality and real character! 
 
Steak frites are served with a delicious green salad and french fries that are tasty. Lemon tarts are delicious, and the portion is large enough for two to share (unless of course, you're a real glutton). Sandwiches are delicious, fresh and the perfect portion for an afternoon snack. 

From suits to hipsters, grandmothers, couples on first, or second, or third dates, girlfriends and tourists, this place attracts a varied crowd. About groups: if you're planning on bringing 5-10 people: call ahead. I've seen a long table of people seated for a birthday dinner but this place fills up quickly (it's a cozy space). Warning: Parents with newborns, SUV style strollers (sorry, but you know who you are), or children who can't sit still will find the small space challenging, so I suggest either coming in for an afternoon snack, when it's typically less busy. 

The atmosphere is cozy, unpretentious and very french, a blend of practical shabby-chic and good old romance: this isn't a glitzy place: this is place that serves good food, with a convivial, sometimes boisterous atmosphere. 

If you want a glossy dining experience, this isn't the place for you. This place isn't about swagger and pretense: At Jules Bistro, you can expect tables being close together, you can expect a fantastic wine list, you can expect a bit of noise (especially on Friday and Saturday nights, when it is typically packed) and you can expect to eat well at reasonable prices. 

So, recap: Reasonable prices, excellent steak frites, great staff and a charming, comfortable atmosphere make this my favourite neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Really love this place. One of those places that is timeless, cosy and tasty. Great music but you can also hear your friends perfectly as you eat delicious French comfort food. A home away from home."}
{"text":"Yes the prix fixe menu is popular with the lunch crowd. But their onion soup starter tastes like it's shaken from a paper box. It relied in fresh green onions strewn on top for an onion finish. The flank steak is salty and overcooked. The other options on the PF menu are also mainly forgettable. But never mind. 

Do go for the cote du boeuf for 2. It's a massive wooden board loaded with mixed green salad, shoestring fries and a beautiful steak carved and seasoned beautifully. It was so big that we had to take a picture with a fork in the shot, to give viewers a sense of scale. The beef was cooked perfectly, medium rare, and served with a tartar sauce fortified with the salty tang of capers. 

So on this dish alone I am awarding this resto an enthusiastic Thumbs Up.

The service is warm but the room is tired. A refresh would do a world of good. Or at the very easy replace the cushions on the banquette. They are, what the French would call, \"le gross\"! ."}
{"text":"A reliable and somewhat cozy French Restaurant, never disappointing. the ambiance is welcoming, even the stark wooden tables fit the place. All the dishes are great, as others have said. 

Service is competent and friendly.

Note, this is NOT a noisy place, you can talk to your friends."}
{"text":"I've been twice now for the delicious steak frites and mille-feuille. Love the chill atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Good. Yummy rack of lamb on the prix fixe for two. Appetizers are seriously appetizers... In layman's terms very, very small portions. Do not expect something that will carry you to your meal because the food takes quite a while to prepare- particularly on a busy night. All in all very delicious, though and very much worth the wait. No mussels on the menu in the summer as they are out of season, but also delicious if you happen to get there when they have them. 

Atmosphere is loud and not very intimate, and seating arrangement is very hit or miss, but they do offer bar seating if you're just popping in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great Prixe fixed menu. Good value for money. Romantic, great date spot."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners and the staff have always been lovely. The food and wine is great at a reasonable price.

Spent a couple birthdays there now, and totally would do it again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Queen West location:  So wanted to like this place but unfortunately it was only mediocre.  Too bright a room, \"electronic\" music is an odd choice, nice but inelegant service (more suited to a concept like Milestones, etc.) and underwhelming food (french onion soup had mere \"bits\" of cheese, frites were only okay, steak was only okay, etc.)."}
{"text":"After a long week at work, when I'm looking for a simple place to eat, feel fancy but not pay the fancy price...Jules is the best place in the city to get a great cocktail, steak frites, crème brûlée with great service."}
{"text":"On the East side of Spadina, Jules offers a nice French option for casual-yet-trendy meetings with friends or partners. Delivering something I can only describe as accessible bistro food, Jules is non-pretentious, and carefree in its rustic-modern decor and plating (our cote de boeuf, which was massive, arrived on a wooden slab). Great \"frites\". A few points off for seasoning (which was lacking here or there), and the prices of a few of the cocktails which arrived smaller than expected, especially compared to our giant plates of food. While I am also a fan of La Palette on Queen, I personally enjoy the contemporary feel of Jules. Ask about the specials when you visit."}
{"text":"One of my favourite local haunts. All of their entrees and sandwiches are really good although my favourite is the steak frites. They'll do takeout and catering too. My only beef is that they are closed Sundays but its a family run joint so they need a day off."}
{"text":"Food came with tons of greens and fries along with my main course, thumbs uppp. One thing is that the food didn't all come at the same time which drives me nuts at restaurants."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Saturday night (walk -in) and they had a seat available right away from a cancelation. The restaurant has a very French vibe.... almost magical ambiance to it, especially in the evening. Our server was charming with is accent and very nice. 

I ordered the pate app. and the mussels main, my husband ordered the burger with Brie cheese. All courses were delicious, only issue was the mussel broth was slightly salty. The meal in total came to $53, awesome! 

I would definitely come back again, even to host a party/birthday. They have great menu items that would accommodate many diets.

Thank you for the quality food and great prices.

{"text":"I had been to this restaurant once before, but wanted come back to try the cote de boeuf for two. Valentine's Day was the perfect day to try this meal for two. 

Luckily we made reservations because the restaurant was packed by 7! We ordered the French onion soup and the daily special appetizer to start. Both were just okay, nothing too special. The main event was the cote de boeuf and this did not disappoint! The ribeye steak is served with a side of fries, ratatouille and mixed greens on a wooden chopping board (perfect for pictures :P). The steak was the highlight but the fries were also on point! They were like McDonalds fries but less salty and greasy. The steak itself was seasoned and prepared just right. I am not sure if it was the piece that we got, but the parts around the bone were just a little bit on the chewy side and a good 10% of the steak was pure fat. I am taking away half a star for that, and taking away another half a star because the service got pretty slow when we were looking to get our bill. Regardless, both of us left full and happy! I would come back again to try the rack of lamb and dessert another time!"}
{"text":"We went to Jules Restaurant last night excited about having good, simple, hearty French bistro fare.  The restaurant interiors made it appear as though our expectations would be met.  The lighting was appropriately dim, the special on the blackboard looked like tantalizing (they had quail!  And rib-eye steak!), and we had a very nice French hostess greet us and lead us to our table.  A quick look at the menu was further exciting.  Aside from standard bistro fare, they offered crepes, quiches, different types of sandwiches, salmon, chicken, and steak (both flank steak and steak tartare!)  

After much indecision, the three of us opted for the prix fixe: we all ordered the french onion soup, and the steak frites, while two of us opted for the creme brulee and one decided that the chocolate mousse sounded too good to resist.  The other person in our party decided that she would rather have a lighter dinner and thus ordered the asparagus and goat cheese quiche.  

Upon receiving our food, we realized that maybe - just maybe - we should have ordered a sandwich or a crepe, which our neighbours in the surrounding tables were eating and enjoying.  In sharp contrast, the three of us felt that we got suckered into ordering a prix fixe meal thinking it was good value for money but which actually had substandard quality.  

The French onion soup was supposed to be deconstructed but which looked lazy.  Rather than having bubbling cheese on top, we instead got a thin broth of onion soup and had to scrape the bottom of the bowl to get to the cheese; someone in our party said that it tasted like pho leftovers, which I thought was an apt observation.  

Our steak frites were, in a word, pathetic: the flank steak was barely a steak and more like a very thin, flavourless hunk of indeterminate beef.  It WAS well-seasoned but the appalling quality of the meat didn't make up for it.  The fries were horrific too.  Someone downthread mentioned its resemblance to McDonalds fries but to say so would be to do a disservices to Mickey D's fries; Jules Restaurant's version were COLD and were chewy, and the garlic mayo that accompanied it didn't add anything to the fries (and I say this as a mayo lover).  

My friend who got the quiche was similarly unimpressed.  The pie crust was made out of what looked like several sheets of philo pastry, thereby resembling spanakopita than standard quiche.  She also said the flavour combination felt a bit bland.

The desserts were a highlight but came a little bit too late.  The creme brulee was fine and what you can find in any good French restaurant.  The chocolate mousse was exquisite and elevated their rating from one to two stars.  It was succulent, rich, and delicious: not too light and not too heavy. If you can come to Jules just for the dessert, do so: there were other people who ordered the chocolate crepes, which looked AMAZING.

Another matter worthy of consideration is the good service.  Our server was constantly checking in on us and was cheerful and considerate.  Perhaps they had a recent staff change but we simply did not experience the poor service other Yelpers did.  For that reason, I also thought that Jules deserved two stars rather than one star.

Bottom line: come for the dessert, skip the prix fixe and the quiches, and don't expect too much!  If you want a better prix fixe deal, why not go to La Palette a few blocks away?"}
{"text":"Man I really wanted to love this place because of the reviews, but was only satisfied, nothing more. 

Steak Frites - $18, came with an abundance of super crispy fries, a very good quality salad (aka not just lettuce), and a very long strip of flank steak. The flavouring was a letdown. It looked very seasoned but tasted so bland. I had to add salt to my steak, which was a first! The fries were ok.

Chicken frites - $18, came with everything i listed above, except with chicken breast. It was dry.

Overall I don't think I would come back. The portions are great, the food was decent, and our server was awesome, but I'll pass."}
{"text":"Very much racist and rude. As soon as you walk in, this older white man sitting at the bar tells \"there's no seat for you\" while the restaurant has quite many seats available. I asked, \"excuse me?\" and he continues to respond, \"there's no seat\" with a nasty smile. I told how rude he was, then he started saying \"I was kidding, come on.\" Seriously? I walked away. Be prepared to be discriminated. Certain people are not welcomed at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful little gem of a place on Spadina! Great in the summertime with a beautiful little patio. The prix fixe is the best value and has my fave that I order each time, steak frites."}
{"text":"I often find myself a bit reserved when it comes to dining at a French restaurant.  For one thing, it' s often pricey and there are items on the menu that sometimes escape my vocabulary if it's a really fine dining establishment.  Sorry grade 9 French is not good enough here.

But alas, that is not the scenario I faced at Jules and it's casual dining atmosphere.  Prices were fair and proportional to quality in my opinion. Of course, there's always going to be exceptions and difference in opinion.

Decor:
The restaurant is small but can accommodate parties as large as 15 without it being awkward.  The use of old school chandeliers couples with rustic wooden tables and flooring is a nice touch but it must be noted that the black/gothic style chandelier in the front of the restaurant does not work with well with the surroundings.

Food:
I tend to order French Onion soup at any French restaurant but forgot to this time.  For me, a good FO soup has a tasty stock and ample bread and cheese.  My friend ordered it and I saw that it was lacking in cheese and bread so already 2/3 was a fail...and I also trust his opinion on taste, in which he gave a \"so so\" response....so sorry Jules.

This being my 3rd time here because my friends have enjoyed the price of this place, I have unfortunately never swayed from my usual choice of the steak frites.  I may have ordered other items in the past but this one seems to be the signature dish for me at Jules. It's a flank steak which they cook very well as it is tender and has enough chew to allow you to savour the juices before it falls apart in your mouth. The fries are just how I like them...thin and crispy. 

This time though, I was informed that the daily special was a flatiron steak and that excited me tremendously.  After my experience at Coquine and tasting their Flatiron steak, I anticipated this one to match in size and taste but oh boy was I let down..just as badly as when the movie, Sucker Punch, came out(it had so much promise!).
The good thing about the steak was that the top layer had nice grill grooves that allowed for a little bit of a crisp layer but that's it.  
The size of the thing would make you sigh...I would say it was  probably 4\" long and 2\" wide.  Let's not think x-rated here please:P  
Taste-wise, it was adequate and I like my steaks rare but this was almost cooked too rare to the point it was cool blue and I don't like that.

I saw the desserts and they looked quite good and even though I didn't taste it, I was able to experience it through facial expression and vocals...hahaha so I assume they were pretty good.


Overall:

All in all, this is a decent restaurant for a fair price if you're looking to go for French food.  Remember that price is proportional to what you pay.  I would highly recommend the Steak Frites if I had a choice.

bon apetit (sp?)"}
{"text":"Jules is now my go-to restaurant for when I want a little treat.  It is a French restaurant without the French restaurant prices.  Located near the corner of Queen and Spadina it is well situated for lunch or dinner.

I have a favorite dish, which luckily is part of the Prix Fixe, which is a reasonable $24.95. It is the \"Sauté de Poulet\". A chicken breast in a mushroom cream sauce.  A pretty simple dish, but it is so good it is all I can do to not lick my plate.  It's made with a lovely bechamel and is seasoned so delightfully that you will be using the slender crisp fries to mop up every last drop.

I have also had the croque monsieur which is excellent, but I have seen someone else get one that should have been cooked longer so ask for it well-done.  The salads are nice, I like the salad chevre because of the goat cheese on the piece of toasted baguette and the light dressing.  Over dressed salads are gross.

And I can't forget the crème brûlée!  I believe you can judge the quality of a restaurant by their crème brûlée and this one is very good.  Crispy top which means it is flamed just before they serve it and despite being essentially fat and sugar is not too heavy.

The wine list is reasonable; good selection and well priced.  All in all a nice place which is why Jules has become my place for a special treat and with the prix fixe and a glass of wine coming in at around $40 it is well worth it."}
{"text":"It appears that in December 2009, a few people dining here had a bad experience and 3 of them gave this restaurant a one-star rating.  I won't dispute their opinions. Any restaurant may have a bad day and any patron has the right to express their frustration in a review, but I feel that those 3 one-star ratings unfairly lower the average of this charming neighbourhood bistro.  

I live nearby. I ate dinner at Jules perhaps 10 times over the last few years.  Never did I experience unpleasant service or any major issues with food. (Once, my meat was too salty. I remember to ask for reduced salt ever since.) This is not high-end extravagant and sophisticated French cuisine.  The menu is full of familiar bistro fare: steak and frites, steak tartare, duck confit, an variety of savory creeps and sandwiches.  The last few times they had cote-de-boeuf on special for 2 people and it was delicious, even though I'm not that fond of red meat.  Their traditional dessert tarts are lovely.  The wine list is basic, but adequate. 

The food perhaps doesn't deserve five stars (I'd say 3.5) but the atmosphere is cosy and unpretentious, even considering French waiters of whom certain dose of snootiness is pretty much expected.  I love going there and I regret that one bad experience has so negatively affected the restaurant's rating.  It really should be better than that."}
{"text":"This cute little French bistro in the heart of downtown quickly became one of my favourite restaurants. In fact, I felt it before I even ordered, the atmosphere is that inviting. Then, once I tasted my food, I was hooked. I had the mussels, which came with fries, toasted bread and a bed of greens. The broth for the mussels was so good I enjoyed it as a soup as well, and the fries had that guilty pleasure McDonald's taste, but somehow better (likely having something to do with not being overly processed junk). The only negative thing I can say is that the French onion soup was not the classic hearty soup I expected, encrusted in hot cheese and bread. It was more of a light version, featuring caramelized onions in a broth. The soup was actually quite delicious in its own right, just don't expect the kind of French onion soup you might have as the staple of your meal."}
{"text":"I was looking for a decent French Bistro on Queen West and thanks for fellow Yelpers, I discovered Jules. I tried their Prix Fixe menu. 3 courses for $25. I ordered caesar salad, steak and frites and Crème brûlée. I wasn't really impressed with the salad and my friends who ordered French onion soup weren't impressed either. It was a miss. But the rests were amazing. I ordered a medium steak and it exceeded my expectation! It was very juicy, tender and full of flavours. If you love mayo, ask them for it. Their mayo's very tasty too. Their Crème brûlée was pretty good as well, my only complaint was the portion. I'm a big fan of steak and frites and it was my fav in Toronto by far. Way better than Celestine's, which was my previous favourite. I love the place. It's small but cozy and I love their open kitchen. I'll revisit to try their chicken dish and other desserts for sure!"}
{"text":"We came in because the smell wafting on the sidewalk was so aromatic and perfect we had to walk in and ask for a table. We were not disappointed. The rack of lamb was some of the best I've ever had and their tuna tartare was superb too. My favorite was the roasted garlic that accompanied the lamb and sliced baguette soaking up the lamb drippings. I wished we lived near by. We'd eat here often."}
{"text":"After visiting Paris back in March, my girlfriend and I have been searching all over the city for authentic French cafes and restaurants alike. After a bit of research, we ended up here on a Friday night. We made a reservation for 7pm and we're glad we did as the place got very busy soon after

For the starter, we had the grilled octopus. It was probably the best octopus I've ever had in my entire life. Seasoned perfectly served with mashed potatoes and green salad. Just like France - nothing overpowering!

And for the main course, we had to try the cote de boeuf. The price seems a little steep at first at $58 but it's meant for two people...and they mean it. It's a 24 oz rib eye served with ratatouille, frites, and salad. I'm a big eater so even with my girlfriend attempting to help me eat it, we were both fully satiated after our meal. 

It was one of the best dinners we've had in Toronto for awhile , bringing back memories of our time in Paris. We were so full we didn't have room to eat dessert! We will go back for the creme brûlée and their tarts!"}
{"text":"Their quiche lorraine and onion soup are amazing. I come here at least once a week. Love it! The only reason they get 4 nkt 5 is because they do not use the beef broth for the onion soup. While it tastes good it is so much better with the beef broth."}
{"text":"One of my go to lunch spots. It's expensive, especially for what you get (both size and quality) but it is good food in a niceish environment.  Salmon nicoise is awesome, but again 20-25$ salad with a modest piece of salmon on top."}
{"text":"The beauty of the bistro menu is its simplicity, and staples like onion soup, steak frites and cream brulee are touchstones by which to judge relative quality and execution ... well, Jules let me down: the onion soup was cold so that the cheese remained unmelted, the fries were of the mcdonald's variety, the steak was seasoned but slight, and the creme brulee was creme brulee ... an appealingly rustic atmosphere though."}
{"text":"late lunch  - they can't substitute ingredients in the crepes because they're \"pre-made\" (!?) - then they are just plain out of the one i decide to order...then I get a Ceasar salad and ask for fresh parm \"we don't do that\" says the waitress...huh? bland salad, ugh.  order some fries to give my lunch a bit more kick, they are too pre-made, sort of cold and a bit on the stale side. Would have been a one star but at least the coffee was good and strong."}
{"text":"I order the Salad Nicoise with Salmon, and a small plate of frites.  Both were delicious, although some of the lettuce was a bit wilted.  Service was great though, and I will be trying this place out again for sure."}
{"text":"I thought I loved this place because of the croque monsieur but that was only because I took it to go, and heated it up at home. I have since gone back and twice its been served cold. This portions are tiny for the price and just not worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent value for Southern French comfort food. Ordered from the prix-fixe menu ($24.95) and had the warm goat cheese appetizer on a bed of arugula, the steak frites, and a creme brûlée. I was happy with all three items.

The piece of steak was quite thin but I don't think a more generous size of meat can be expected at this price.

A nearby table ordered the cote de boeuf which looked really delicious. We will probably try it on our next visit."}
{"text":"OK, if there's anything a traditional French bistro HAS to be able to nail is Steak Frites. Two of us stopped in for lunch and ordered such, medium rare. Both steaks came out rare - annoying, but not a complete disaster if the meat is good. No such luck: the steaks were full of gristle and connective tissue, and almost tasteless - kind of like the industrial-quality meat sold by some of the cheaper butchers in town. Really? Really?? Is that the best you can do for $17.95, Jules? Honestly, I don't mind paying a couple of bucks more for quality. The meal we were served was more on the level of a crappy diner."}
{"text":"Nice little place just south of Chinatown.  Went there one weeknight while visiting town and had the special veal chops. Nicely cooked medium rare and decently seasoned.  Fresh greens on the side.  Also had the spicy shrimp which were lovely.  This is a small place with very knowledgeable staff.  Quite the wine list with by the bottle, litre and bottle prices.  Ambience is average but hey no kids so don't mind the grown up conversations."}
{"text":"On the decline?

I used to go here all the time as far back as the '90's when Jules opened, and I love the owners, great people. Food was hearty authentic and generous with reasonable prices. Jules made this part of Spadina come alive.

A recent evening visit was chaotic, expensive and unsatisfying with horrible service. My friend's meal was OK but no wow. My crepe was a tiny cigar size, and the bread order I really wanted t enjoy with it was ignored. Wait, no the brat serving us apologized before bringing the bill - she didn't forget part of the meal, she made it clear she did not care. Horrible long waits to order and pay (with empty-stomach grumbling) makes at least three strikes on one visit.

Sorry Mahasti and Eric, but the place needs good people like you to run it when you're away - not these snotty hipsters. I hope the next visit is better, and till then have to be honest with my Toronto neighbours what they might expect on a less ideal visit. 2.5 stars just for now. And I still love you because you believed, and you worked so damn hard."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Cote de Boeuf for two, which was juicy, flavourful, and perfectly seared to our requested medium-rare.  Though it was enough to share between the two of us, we still found ourselves wanting a bit more - so if you have a bigger appetite, I'd recommend at least getting an appetizer as well to feel a little more full.

Our friends enjoyed the steak tartare and assiette du chef (charcuterie plate) which had a fair mix and variety of cheeses and meats.  

Service was a little slow: our steak appeared to have been missed out from the order ticket, though was quick to appear after we were able to flag down our waitress.  Getting our water glasses refilled was also no easy feat.  However, given the tasty meal and reasonable pricing, I'd be more than happy to dine at Jules Bistro again."}
{"text":"Jules Bistro is one of my favourite French restaurants in Toronto. It's classy without being pretentious and offers great quality French cuisine at reasonable prices.

My go-to is the steak frites which comes with a bed of fresh salad and ratatouille. The flavours are wonderful and the ingredients are very fresh. At $22 you can't go wrong, although the steak can be a little on the tough side.

On another visit for a special occasion, we decided to order from the prix-fixe menu and split the côte de boeuf ($48.95 per person) which was again very good but the meat was quite fatty. I don't think I'd order it again. The set menu was extensive, however, with a choice of starters (soup, salmon, scallops), mains (beef, rack of lamb, cornish hen) and desserts (mousse, chocolate crepe, crème brulée). Our server allowed starter and dessert substitutions at a small additional cost which was nice.

Next on my list is the sauté de poulet which looked delicious as I saw plates being delivered to other tables. The rack of lamb also looked divine.

Overall, this is one of the best French restaurants I've found in Toronto so far, and I'd recommend a visit. Try to make a reservation though, as they can get very busy toward the weekend."}
{"text":"This is an adorable cafe with some delicious french treats. My friend and I stopped by to take a break during a day of shopping downtown. She was looking for a light lunch and I wanted dessert, so Jules was the perfect stop for us. I had an Americano and a lemon tart, both of which were delicious. The lemon tart came on a pastry shell instead of the shortbread crust I usually find (and use when I bake myself), but it was still pretty good. I found the food a tad expensive, but I'm not a native Torontonian so I'm not sure how it compares to other cafes in the city. Service was fast and friendly. All around a good experience!"}
{"text":"Would I come back here? Hmm. Maybe not because I haven't tried The Loving Hut across from it which I hear has rave reviews (I'm eating vegan as much as possible these days).

Maybe, if I wasn't eating vegan/vegetarian that day and will cheat to eat a steak tartare (although I can just make it myself it's not that hard).

I took a quiche and a tarte, and both were okay.

FRENCH ONION SOUP
The deconstructed french onion soup seemed a bit greasy (can see the oil on top), and was SO flavourful that when I went to go eat the quiche, I needed salt. A lot of it.

I also wasn't a fan of the croutons soaked in there (I usually avoid croutons in a French Onion soup, as I just want the onions...!), but I did like eating a whole whack of mozzarella cheese melted at the bottom.

Just found it rather greasy in general, or oily-looking.

QUICHE
The quiche itself was good and WAY better than at Patachou near Summerhill station (now THAT is an embarrassing place to eat because they pretend to know how to make a quiche but really have no idea it tastes like tofu for dogs).

The only downside to the quiche for me was that I took the vegetarian option but the leeks made it all mushy. WIth leek quiches you absolutely need to eat them hot and freshly made, otherwise it just tastes odd. You're better off eating the ham quiche than a leek one that isn't fresh out of the oven. Just a tip from me to you.

TARTE
The tarte was also good but odd. I was somehow expecting something creamier and more like a firmer creme brulee but with fruit on top, and this one tasted more like the filling was ground almonds with blueberries. Still delicious, but it was rather tough (the crust was) and hard to finish due to my struggling with a fork.

Is this the best French place to eat in Toronto? No. Go to Didier by St. Clair if you want to try better French bistro fare at lunch.

Does this make decent desserts to eat? I've only had the tarte which wasn't so bad, but I still prefer Nadege by Ossington / Queen for pastries.

Is this a decent place to eat if you're in the area, starving and with no other choices around as far as you can see? Yes."}
{"text":"Great little French Bistro spot, good atmosphere and service; and reasonable prices.

Go if you want French bistro food classics, nothing too posh."}
{"text":"Jules bistro, where do I begin. I personally have not been to the original location on Spadina but came to this one for dinner prior to a event  just down the street. We thought Jules would be a good choice for a pre-party meal and a few drinks.

There are ups and downs to the place, I can tell there are still some kinks to be ironed out. Some of the wait staff could be more refined and have more knowledge about the food and wine menus.  Charlotte is a great hostess/bartender and waitress she did a great job making our night memorable. 

We did some table hopping due to a large party that came in on  short notice but the owners and Charlotte took care of us and recognized the inconvenience. We got some bubbly and dessert. The hospitality was great.

For food we shared the octopus ($19) which was on the daily specials wall (the regular menu is small so be sure to look at what specials they have for the day). The octopus was tender, charred, and seasoned to perfection, definetly worth coming back for.  

We shared the cote de boeuf which was $64 it came with salad, frites and ratatouille. It was good, tender cooked to our liking (medium rare). The salad could use a more flavourful dressing/vinegrette. It is relatively simple in terms of flavor, nothing stood out as particularly special to be honest but it was good. 

Cocktails - we had a negroni and a gin based house cocktail (can't remember the name but it was $14) they were very good and we'll crafted.

All in all I would return for cocktails and apps, and perhaps to try a different main."}
{"text":"Jules has an amazing vibe and environment. The wait staff are young and friendly and overall it's a great casual place for food and drinks. It's a lively place - not a place for a quiet date. Great affordable prix fix 3 course menu ($32.95).

However, food here was mediocre at best. We tried each of the prix fix options and found everything to be below average with the exception of both desserts (creme brulee and chocolate mousse). Appetizers (salad, goat cheese, and french onion soup) were bland, and steak tasted like beef jerky.

I won't be craving to return, but for that price it's a great place for a longer meal."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a weeknight.  The place was pretty packed, but we got a table without any issue.  The environment is kind of cool because the menu is written in chalk on the walls.  They have some really interesting stuff on the menu, but I went with the prix fixe 3 course meal which included goat cheese bread for my appetizer, steak frites for my main, and chocolate mousse for my dessert.  It cost around $25.  Overall it was a pretty satisfying meal, but there wasn't anything special about the steak, the fries, and the chocolate mousse.  The goat cheese bread was really tasty but it was too small of a portion.  This is more of a place you'd go on a date than to stuff your face.  Pretty decent."}
{"text":"A classy french bistro without an attitude. Many repeat customers- the chef and his family are always talking to the customers and make it feel like you've been invited into their home, even if they aren't talking to you.  The food includes a list of sandwiches, quiche, salads, real meals- steak frites, poulet frites and moule frites. My favorite it the moule frites and I always get a side of bread to soak up some of the white wine broth. Frites are french style- skinny and crispy.  Good wine selection by the glass, carafe, or bottle. Totally reasonable prices. Sandwiches are delicious, due to being decadently full of mayonnaise.  Desserts are also killer here- Lemon tart or chocolate mousse- you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I headed down here with a friend after touring downtown. We were looking for a cold drink (or two) and a good seat to do some people watching. We found both.

The drinks were good, however the water was room tempurature. What's up with that? This isn't some sort of Canadian thing is it? Not a fan of it, regardless. After taking in the scenery for a while (the girls in Toronto are HOT!), we stayed for food and had a pretty good overall experience.

The only reason this place got three stars instead of four was slowish service and high prices (for the type of food provided). Otherwise, the outside deck was worth it!"}
{"text":"Tried their menu on a Saturday night. I highly recommend making a reservation since it gets very busy and call by phone if there's nothing available online. We sat by the bar, and it was fun to watch the cooking; it was a bit hot and my clothes smelled like meat for days. I enjoyed the ambience and my meal, except for the steak which was over cooked so the meat was tough (wanted medium rare, but got well done). Desserts were also a bit too sweet for my personal liking, but I enjoyed the fries!"}
{"text":"I love Jules Bistro! Our second time there tonight and was so impressed I had to write a review.

We had the chef's pick appetizer platter (I forget the exact name.. but its the 2nd on the menu for $10). Good to share between my boyfriend and I. There was bread, pickles, meats, cheeses and caramelized onion? It was fun to build your own bite size sandwich :)

We each got a veal chop - it's on the chalkboard and not on their menu. Decent portion of meat with a pile of fries and salad. Highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful French restaurant.  We started with Prosecco and the Assiettes du Chef which included a selection of prosciutto and ham, cornichons, caramelized onions and little slices of toasted baguette.  This made me very happy.  We also ordered Chèvre Chaud which is warm goat cheese on toasted bread, mixed greens house vinaigrette, the French Onion soup, Steak Frites (full of flavour and cooked perfectly).  Desserts included the creme brule and I personally had some strawberry cream puff thing that had the lightest custard and strawberries inside and some creme fraiche on the side.  I was in heaven and had to share this with each one of my guests.  The ambience is truly lovely and warm.  Our waitress was charming but I felt that she could have checked on us a bit more.  We were left alone for a bit when we first arrived.  The gentleman who greets the guests seemed very serious and focused but when he smiled, had such a great expression.  Overall, I observed that the staff in general are wonderful and take care of their customers with hospitality and warmth.  This is a place of high quality and very reasonably priced.  A memorable culinary experience."}
{"text":"The dishes were excellently prepared and service was fabulous. Very friendly and patient staff. The apple tart is delicious and everyone should try it. I can't wait to go back again. This place is one of my favourite place in downtown core.we got price fix menu for $29.95 and I had salmon and my dining partner had chicken with mushroom sauce. Both were excellent and the price is well worth it. The food is not salty and not too oily. Felt like a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Everything a French bistro should be, with lovely French staff and a very charming and hospitable manager.  The dinner prix fixe menu for $25 is a great deal. Great wine list at good prices.  You would struggle to get a better steak frites anywhere in the world.  This is one of Toronto's most pleasant places to have dinner in a relaxing atmosphere with great service at a reasonable price.   Worth repeat visits."}
{"text":"Decent spot for the price. Nice decor and good vibe. Definitely fills a void but not a place you go for a top end meal. But then again, that's not what this place is trying to be. As long you keep this mind, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here with great expectations and left a bit disappointed. The french onion soup was alright, but it wasn't baked in the dish the way I like it (this is not influencing my score though). The steak tips were really tough. The salmon was alright, but nothing extraordinary. The menu said the salmon dish would be served with ratatouille, but my plate came with literally 4 pieces of vegetables. 

The crème brûlée was mediocre, and I've had better (where they serve it on a shallow dish so you get a lot of the burnt surface). The chocolate mousse was average.

All in all, I don't think it was worth the price. Maybe next time we'll try the steak dinner for two."}
{"text":"It felt like I was in Paris all over again, which is exactly what I was hoping for when I made a reservation chez Jules. Simply order the prime rib sharing plate and a couple glasses of wine for you and your companion, and don't look back. It's the perfect ratio of HIGH quality meat, carbs (baguette + French fries), salad (classic French spring mix + lemon & olive oil salad), and ratatouille. The meat and the ratatouille were exceptional. Enjoy a visit into Parisien cuisine done in a traditional manner."}
{"text":"Affordable authentic French food delivered in a friendly and efficient manner. This place is a winner and a breath of fresh air in a French restaurant market saturated with high cost and small serving sizes."}
{"text":"Excellent food, a great spot for a french bite and a chat."}
{"text":"Had our anniversary dinner here, ordered the cote de boeuf aka meat platter for two, it was so good. We also had their app special, pan seared scallops which was equally as good.
Definitely we recommend to friends and come back"}
{"text":"Coming here on a week day by impulse, I got surprised that it was located right next to Fusaros yet boyfriend and I never noticed it. We were thinking of settling somewhere near Kekou, and thought of Jules as some friends had recently came here for dinner.

Jules Bistro serves French cuisine but in my opinion, I think it's hardly French - more towards the fusion side.

The restaurant setting and layout was almost identical to Fusaros, with limited seating given the space. They had their entire menu chalkboard out near the ceiling, while their tables are wooden and closely placed next to one another. Overall it gave off a pleasant atmosphere for relaxing after work.

I've noticed many people ordered beer with their meats. But being Asian, I ordered a soup de l'oignon (onion soup). I've had numerous onion soups are various restaurants but still never knew what authentic French onion soup is, so I can't be the judge of this. At Jules, the soup was quite thin and soup base was not thick at all. The aroma and onion taste was definitely there alongside onion slices thinly cut. One thing I preferred more of was the cheese content. The more the merrier please! I noticed a large portion lot was stuck at the bottom of the bowl.

We also had the cote de boeuf pour deux. It was amazing! The meat was cooked just right at medium rare, flavour was locked within the steak, and the fat portion was just perfect. You can tell the steak was sauteed well with herbs and salt too. Overall, the steak was nicely done even without sauce.

For this dish, it was accompanied with ratatouille veggie mix, fries, and a house salad. The dressing was just right, yet they still offered additional ketchup, mustard, and some type of spicy mayonnaise that didn't really taste like mayo.

All in all, the service was pretty good. They were nice to provide a new bottle of water without asking and knew to ask about food sharing. As for service, the food came out promptly."}
{"text":"I love the feel of the space but in the end, it is the food that counts and it is full of flavour. The veggie french onion soup is rich in flavour without too much  cheese. The chicken fillet with mushroom sauce was delicious. I will go back just for that. Their desserts are also very good. Prices are very reasonable. Dinner for two with cocktails and appetizers came to $80."}
{"text":"I've walked by this restaurant so many times but haven't actually gotten around to trying it until my friend recommended we come for dinner, and I'm so glad we did! I ordered off their prix fixe menu which included an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. Definitely value for your money. My appetizer was the french onion soup - pretty good and there were lots of croutons, cheese, and green onions inside. For my main I chose the steak frites - this is what the restaurant is especially known for and did not disappoint. Steak was very flavourful, and I am a huge fan of skinny fries. To end the meal I got the creme brulee - tasty and the portion was just right for dessert. Needless to say, I'll definitely come back for dinner and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yummy French bistro with very reasonable prices (most entrées are under $20) and a lovely, casual atmosphere. Line ups are not unusual around lunch time but if you go just when they open (11:30, I believe) or closer to 1pm it's often easier to get a table.

Everything I've had has been great, and the service is for the most part friendly, prompt, and attentive without being overbearing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place, but the small (I assume) owner needs to immediately stop inappropriately touching guests. He 'caressed' my and my friend's back/side for an uncomfortable length of time while asking us how we enjoyed the meal. Noticed the same clearly unwanted touching of a server, and heard the same crap from another friend. Lost our appetite. Quit it buddy!"}
{"text":"After learning the place we wanted to go for dinner and doesn't take reservations was 1.5+hrs wait time we decided to wander around and landed to this great place. I am so glad we stayed! 

One person chose - French onion soup, salmon entrée, and crème brulee dessert from the 3 course pre fixe section. The other two of us went with the rack of lamb meal for 2 that included fries, salad, and ratatouille. Lamb was cooked to perfection - juicy and tender; all the sides were a perfect accompaniment. The presentation was spectacular and practical on a wooden chopping block. 

Servers were had a sense of humor and were knowledgeable in their menu (it didn't hurt that ours had an aussie accent); space was warm and open; food was hearty and good quality. Special shout out for the crème brulee - best I have ever had: light & fluffy, not too sweet & very fine in texture. 

The bill for those 3 entrees + no drinks was $90 something. At first I was disappointed we weren't going to be able to dine at our first choice restaurant but another victory in a night of spontaneity. Jules Bistro saves the night."}
{"text":"Came here and this place charged an automatic 20% gratuity for large parties. Knowing this, the waitress purposely concealed this - didn't tell us and didn't say anything when we tipped an additional 18% on top of this. Sh-ite service."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends, so we probably took up half the restaurant. We really appreciated the effort the staff put to accommodate us - because we know there isn't a big space. The place has a very classy decor with the bar situated at the back. 

I shared a Cote le Boeuf with my partner, and we split a Grilled Octopus with another couple. Our Cote le Boeuf actually came out medium rare instead of rare. But the waitress was very polite and explained that there may have been some miscommunication. So we kept it. Both dishes were very good - so, I would have guessed that the rare steak would have been absolutely amazing. I also did try my friends dishes (Rack of Lamb) and I would say that it wasn't as juicy as we would have expected. I think if I was to return, I would definitely try the french onion soup. A lot of my friends ordered this (it was also part of the price fix menu) and it made my mouth water. The soup looks very normal at first but the all the cheese was actually all at the bottom. Yum!

Overall, the experience was pretty good and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"As the french say, J'Adore. This French Bistro is worth trying out. I have  been there several times to grab take out and I'm always so happy with me meals. I finally had the chance to go there for dinner not too long ago and their prix fixe was great and reasonably priced. 

The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. The owner is always circling to speak with everyone and make them feel welcome. The servers are always helpful and give the great illusion of being happy. (you never really know when your job forces you to be happy). The kitchen is out in the open so you know exactly who's making your food and how it's prepared

The Croque Monsier is great as is the burger and the fries are those delicious long skinny good ones. I suggest asking for a side of mayo with them. I also really love their French Onion Soup. 

I feel bad for the other yelpers who had a less than superb experience here because I have had nothing but great service / food / experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful space. 
Amazing food. 
Great service. 
What more can a customer ask for. The space is cozy but airy, the food is simple and delicious and the service is friendly and well informed. 
Will certainly be back to try their menu in depth."}
{"text":"Enjoyable ambience and delectable food, pairs with great friends and wine!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here, the service was good, the waiter we had was excellent. But the food was the star of the show, very basic rustic french cuisine, and i loved it. We had  the rack of lamb for 2 which was served on a big cutting board with a spring mix salad, frites and a VERY delicious ratatouille. the lamb was done to absolute perfection, and was beautifully seasoned. It was honestly spectacular. I loved the fact that they had placed the lamb on top of slices of crusty french bread, which of course soaked up the delicious juices. I'd say my only disappointment was the seared scallop appetizer, for $14.95, as we received exactly 2 scallops, not jumbo, but just your basic loonie sized scallops, when they served it, i just had to snicker, because it was just so ridiculous to order an appetizer and receive only 2 scallops, if they were jumbo, i could have excused it. However the scallops were indeed delicious.
Overall the place was quaint, bright, and very casual with very good service. I loved the food here and would not hesitate to return, next time for the steak!! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Fabulous choice for French-flourished dishes, wine list, and a cozy room. Weather permitting, do sit on the patio out back which functions as a semi-airy and enclosed seasonal space. The Jules Bistro service is stellar, attentive but not too chummy. All dishes ordered were excellent as part of the prix fixe menu, especially the vegetarian French onion soup."}
{"text":"Jules is and always has been a great place for lunch and even dinner if you are in the area, I have never had a bad meal here. My favorite has always been the tuna steak by far, you just cant beat a properly prepared tuna steak. Last time I had one of their omelettes with brie / asparagus and it was huge and very tasty, but you really need to like brie...lots of it.

The prices are also very reasonable and service is fine for what I would expect. This place is definitely worth a visit and almost anything you get should be good...just dont order a salad please OK?"}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 dudes in a busy restaurant. From sit down to stand up the service was excellent! And the food even better. I had the vegetarian French onion soup. The broth was deep and delicious and full of umami. For our main my buddy across the table and I split the rib steak for two and it was perfect. Well-seasoned, perfectly cooked, and nice and fatty. The fries on the board were super crisp and the simple green salad was an excellent way to cut through the heaviness of the steak. 

Perfect meal. 5 stars. Go!"}
{"text":"This isn't for the food, we always split the lamb board or steak and it's amazing. It's for the awful service, staff and vibes.

I come here a lot and plan on coming here again so I won't get too specific, we came in without a reservation, 7 tables were empty but \"reserved\" so we sat at the bar but the waitress assured us she'd give us the first available table. The chef cooks behind the bar and he is so loud and obnoxious he made us want to leave, he thinks he's competing on top chef hahaha, he's just a jerk.....Finally after 30 mins we're given one of the reserved tables that has been sitting open the whole time!!!

We get our food and as we are eating, we begin to find bits of other frozen food in our salad and fries. This happens 3 times, each time we tell the server. We're not assholes, we understand it happens. We are offered a free dessert which we decline and get the bill to find NO comps or even adjustments to make up for this gross, thrice repeated mistake. So frustrating and also fitting for the asshole chef. Food is still great tho."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Octopus I have ever had. Ridiculously tender, melt in your mouth and packed full of flavor. The Côte de boeuf is just as everyone says, melt in your mouth goodness. The meat is soft and perfectly seasoned paired with perfectly salted frites and ratatouille. Charming little bistro that definitely brings you to feel like you're having an intimate dinner in France. I've never loved French cuisine more than I have since I've tried out Jules."}
{"text":"A wide room with the kitchen at the back and tables set close together. On a busy night a bit noisy.

The service was swift, friendly and quite informal.

One of the highlights of our meal was undoubtedly the octopus starter: Large legs, crisp outside, with tender flesh inside and tasty. Recommended.

The Caesar salad was standard and the steak frites from the prix-fix, O.K.. (no salad: The steak frites from the à la carte did have salad). The frites were disappointingly commercial in nature.

The grilled tuna was a large piece of fish well peppered on an excellent ratatouille bed.

The crème brûlée was fine.

A good selection of reasonably priced wines."}
{"text":"We went to dinner the other day at this restaurant and left a bit underwhelmed with the food. I ordered the Jules Burger and had asked for the tomato slices to be not put in. But they forgot to take it out. Also, the patty could have been bigger since my bread slices were larger than the party. My boyfriend ordered they Steak Frites and thought it was very average. The service was average - nothing exceptional. 

The restaurant is sort of a French affair with very average food and service for the price you pay. Nothing memorable. Don't think we will be trying it out again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a few times over a number of years now and Jules is one of our regular spots now for casual, authentic french fare. Ingredients are simple and the food is fresh. 

 I am not a huge meat eater so I adore the crepes and the french fries are delish with the mayo dip. Can't say I eat my healthiest when I am there but its a treat. The meat dishes are quite good though whether its the quail or chicken cooked in butter and bacon..hey, you can always opt for the side salad! The only thing I'm not really a fan of is their ceviches. I think they should experiment with different, perhaps sweeter flavours? Some of the desserts are on the counter for you to eyeball and drool over. 

I only wish they would offer fois grois - perhaps just sometimes, as one of their specials. I know they try to keep the costs down as its not supposed to be a pricey restaurant but fois grois is my weakness and ironic since Im not much of a meat eater!
Oh and would also be great if they could use organic meat but again, that would drive the cost up. 

We usually sit at the counter and watch them cook. We've made new friends sitting at the communal bench - most fit the definition of a regular more than we do. Its a very nice atmosphere  and the restaurant is super cute. If you are there around closing then they crank up the tunes and start belting them out. Fun times!"}
{"text":"Two people I've met recently told me about this place, so it was time to check it out.  It aligned nicely with something else in the area after, so dinner at Jules was good timing.

Overall experience was OK.  Service was nice, and the restaurant is charming.  Great interior and vibe to it.

Food reviews are more mixed.  My friend had the sauteed chicken and it was pretty tasty. I had the steak frites.  The plate was plentiful with fries, salad and ratatouille however the steak was incredibly tough.

Not a bad night, however I don't think Jules is so affordable that I should sacrifice good steak for the price.  I'd rather pay a few bucks more somewhere else for the same dish."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! The staff are super friendly, the ambiance lovely, and the food awesome... What more can one ask for?  It's been a while since I reviewed a place and originally I wasn't going to, that's why I don't have any pictures of the apps, but when the mains came out, they were so spectacular that I had to take a picture. 

For the appetizer we had the mussels (special of the day) and the mixed selection of apps which had some meats, brie, salad, little cucumbers and stuff like that. The mussels were delicious and came with fries that were cooked perfectly and came with a little dish with mayo AND ketchup in the same dish... Perfection! (My friends make fun of me because I dip my fries in mayo)

I was blown away by the mains! The cote de boef (did I spell that right?) was seasoned and cooked perfectly and it came with those awesome fries. It also came with a side salad which reduced my guilt (by just a little) of indulging so much that night. But the ribs were out of this world!!! The roasted rosemary gave it such a comforting feeling, it made me feel like I was at home sharing a meal with family (and btw came with those awesome fries as well).  A lot of restaurants over salt their food.... This place does not, even with the fries! It's great you actually taste the food for what it is and all its true flavours!

For dessert we shared the upside down apple pie, berry pie, and the creme brulé. The apple pie just melted in my mouth, so delicious, but I have to say that the creme brulé was the show stopper for me. It was creamy and smooth, not tough like jello. It had such a different and more delicate flavour than other creme brulés that I have tried...I was a little sad that we had to share it, should have ordered another for just myself :( ... Next time!

All week I've been showing all my friends the pics of my dinner here and making them jealous...I definitely plan to return with each of them!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to a wonderful French bistro in the hood and sadly we were incredibly underwhelmed. When we arrived the server was very pleasant, chatty, perhaps overly so and then, gone once the food arrived, never cam by to ask how the food was. Had she we would have said that the salmon tartare was tasteless and the fries were like frozen fries not frites that one would expect in a French bistro. The tuna had bones in it and was also tasteless. The ratatouille that came with the tuna helped although
The two didn't seem to pair.
Worst of all was the '80's music- terrible and very loud- not at all fitting with the vibe or what one would expect. It was hard to enjoy. Again, had anyone attended to us other than changing plates and cutlery, I would have expressed this. Even when we got the bill, no inquiry as to how was your meal, did you enjoy - nothing.  I can as easily go to La Palette, just down the road where the service is spectacular, the food consistently delicious and the vibe relaxed, no crappy music, (and excellent fries, as with oyster boy a few doors away), I will choose to go there over Jules any day."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is really good and pretty close to traditional French food. However, the service was deplorable. 
We had to wait ten minutes to get our orders taken and another ten minutes to get our check. 
The waiters were basically ghosting us and I had to literally go to their station and complain. For the price you pay you should have a good service and experience. 

Good food, HORRENDOUS service."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a croque monsieur before eating a Jules Bistro, or maybe years ago in Paris, but it wasn't stand out, so I've never ventured to try one again. But the croque monsieur here is OUTSTANDING!!! Hands down the best sandwich I've ever had (if I may call this open faced dish a sandwich). I have been craving ever since, and will definitely be back for another!"}
{"text":"Came here for a girls' night out and had a blast. Being very familiar with this area, I was surprised that I didn't know about it before. 

The Good:

- The food was amazing. Several of us ordered the salmon tartare. It came with a side of salad and fries, and was to die for. Great price, great taste, great portions. Loved it, loved it, loved it. Can't wait to be back for more.

- Service was efficient and friendly! We were engrossed in a conversation about dating, and our waitress chimed in with a fun story of her own as she poured our wine. We were there for several hours on a weekend night, and didn't feel rushed at all. 

- Ambiance was good as well. Great vibes.

- While we were seated by the door, we didn't feel the cold at all because we were cocooned by a big curtain/separation.

The Bad:

- I'm struggling to find something bad here (which is normally not a problem for me). I didn't like that one of our waiters had a man bun. I hate man buns.

Bottom line: This place is a hidden gem and I am so happy that I found it. You should absolutely come here and enjoy a delicious and reasonably priced dinner."}
{"text":"Not sure is the food (octopus and salmon) or the drink. I got really bad stomach hurt."}
{"text":"Jules Bistro is the place you want to go when you want to be taken back to your vacation last year to the south of France.
The food and the service is absolutely brilliant! I love the rustic and eclectic vibe. I highly recommend the steak frites! It'll definitely be a party in your mouth! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There is something about great waiters/waitresses that just gets to me. The waiter we had here was absolutely phenomenal in promoting the specials, appetizers of the day and mains. He made you want them, and you definitely were not disappointed!

We had the shrimp stuffed calamari, and shared the cote de Boeuf. .The core de bouef was gigantic, and was accompanied with fries, salad, ratatouille. Absolutely enjoyed both, and would highly recommend it.

Also tip- the restaurant is fairly small, so to avoid waiting, come during off peak times!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night.  Good thing we had a reservation as this place was getting more and more packed as we sat.  Service was quick and staff really friendly. We ordered their appetizer special (scallops -  14.95) ,  and the cote de boeuf for two (58).  Both did not disappoint! Portion was enough for two, and the rub on the ribeye was very tasty.  All components of the dish were good.  Would definitely come back.  Also noticed a lot of people and the prixe fix menu,  at 24.95  you can't go wrong with the food they make."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Octopus and Rack of Lamb were delicious. A must to visit if you are in Toronto."}
{"text":"What I thought would be the first official stop on the list where we could sit for our French Fry crawl turned into the \"Is this really happening?!\" stop of the night. 

As we approached the restaurant, we noticed the whole left side of it had empty tables. We all brightened to being warm and able to sit while enjoying our fries. As we stepped in, the waiter walked up and looked at us strangely, like 5 people had just walked into his house unannounced. I asked, \"may we sit anywhere?\". He replied, \"no\" with such an air that I wondered if we really HAD walked into his house unannounced. He then proceeded to tell us that the empty tables were reserved for a party of 25. We asked what time they were arriving. He said 7pm. We all pulled out our phones to see that it was actually 7:12pm. Hmm, party of 25 or snooty waiter lives in restaurant and didn't want guests? I'm leaning towards the latter. 

He then let us know that the only table that would be able to \"accommodate\" our party had just been occupied so it would be a long wait. Kat went to the back to do a take out order and as we stood and waited in ANOTHER doorway, I observed several things: 

1. Two ladies were sitting at a table. The tables on either side of them (also two seater tables) were empty. Even if he had offered to see if they were willing to move, it would've added a star.

2. A lady was sitting at a table on the phone, arguing and crying. It has nothing to do with the review but I thought I would add it because it was uncomfortable standing near her--not that standing in the doorway of a restaurant after being rejected for seating is any less uncomfortable!!

3. We were there for about 15-20 min and the alleged party of 25 STILL had not arrived. The party must have been a Royal family or Mafia kingpin to have a reservation held THAT long!

4. Upon leaving, the same server that Kat dealt with who couldn't speak English, brought us our fries and said something along the lines of \"here are your fries\" and \"goodbye\"--ALL IN ENGLISH! 

ICING ON THE RUDE CAKE? The fries tasted EXACTLY like McD's fries! 

Want to save yourself the trouble of Jules? Leave the restaurant, turn right and walk to the corner of Queen and Spadina. Cross over to the northwest side (diagonally across the street) and walk into McD's. The fries will be $4 cheaper and the smiles are free! 

Note: just because you've designed your restaurant as a French bistro, doesn't mean you need to perpetuate the stereotype by having servers who are rude and refuse to speak English!"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday evening but was still able to grab a res few hours prior. It was busy and packed, and I mean packed (always a good sign) We were seated at the bar because our table wasn't ready yet since we were sort of early. My boyfriend and I had the lovely pleasure of sitting by the bar in front of the open kitchen. I go to watch the chefs work flow and see my food cooked before my eyes. It was pretty sweet. 

We ordered the grilled octopus appetizer, steak tartare, and tuna tartare. I really recommend getting either tartare spicy for that nice kick. It was served with a generous side of green salad and home fries. My tuna tartare was sour, spicy, and wonderfully seasoned. Cannot go wrong with tartare. The grilled octopus, which was a pair of medium sized tentacles was perfectly charred but not overly cooked on the inside. It definitely still retained a soft texture and chew. I really recommend getting this appetizer. It was so tasty! 

The bill came up to 72 dollars for all 3 dishes which I find super reasonable for a French restaurant. Service was excellent and attentive, so I have no complaints there. Honestly, I would come back because they had these set meals for 2 to share, one with prime rib that I was eyeing at the whole time while waiting. The portions seemed huge but man oh man did that prime rib look beautiful. Definitely worth a visit if you want to try some French food without breaking your wallet too much!"}
{"text":"My friend's boyfriend introduced this place to me. The grilled octopus was very tasty. The creme brûlée was good. Service was fast, friendly with a warm smile. I will definitely come back on a more hungry night to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"It's good for the price you're paying.

Food is good. Ordered the onion soup to start, which is more like a 'deconstructed' french onion soup and was tasty. Had the steak frites as my main - comes with fries, spring mix salad and ratatouille. Steak was a little tough, but what do you expect for flank steak at $22?

Keep in mind that the prix-fixe steak frites do not come with salad or ratatouille - my boyfriend ordered off the prix-fixe menu and while we both ordered the steak frites, he was disappointed to find his meal did not come with the same sides as mine.

Ambiance and decor is lovely - exposed brick walls, vintage chairs and tables, dimly lit, crowded but cozy. Not everyone's cup of tea, but I dig it.

Service is what knocked down my rating 2 notches. Do not come here for the service. It is slow and the wait staff tend to forget about you once you've placed your order. It took 20 minutes for someone to notice we were done our mains, and another 20-30 minutes for our dessert to come. 

Overall, a decent experience. I would come back but with adjusted expectations."}
{"text":"Our reservations were for 7:30pm but coming from uptown  (north end of Toronto) with traffic and all, we didn't arrive till 7:45-7:50pm. They gave our table away as they didn't want to hold it. OK I agree if the place was rammed which it was. We waited till 8:30pm for the next table. The place is really tiny and narrow and floors are slippery. I was wearing heels since we were celebrating a friends return from overseas and we had plans to hit a lounge after dinner. So ladies please be careful if you go to this place in heels ... you can hurt yourself I almost fell. And no I was not wearing super high heels either. Mine were regular nine west shoes. 

Make sure you have reservations Friday-Sunday if you want to eat here during dinner time. It's really packed. But once you start ordering the food does come quickly. We had a party of 7 people so we decided to order shareables. 
First we ordered the rack of lamb for two people to share but they said they are out. Say what?? It's only 8:30pm and you out of an item? Damn! OK so we got the steak for two and chicken for two plus 2 large salads, 1 garden salad, 1 fish and I can't remember the rest. The food was tasty except for the steak which they over seasoned. It was way too salty. Talk about bloating. Had to wash it down with some red wine. 

Overall experience, food is good. Would I come back? Maybe. It's hard when you drive downtown and parking is a nightmare and so is traffic. I would come back if I were hanging around at my friend's place already and ended up walking or transporting through Subway or Transit to this location. Because the restaurant is right on Spadina and Richmond it's almost impossible to find any parking along this area on busy hours of the evening especially on weekends."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING from start to finish. We ordered two sets of the 3 course prix fixe. The ribeye and lamb were juicy and cooked perfectly. Loved the thin McDs styled fries, the super flavourful ratatouille, and the side of greens which was accompanied by what tasted like a lemon vinaigrette. Finished off with creme brulee and crepe for dessert. Very full and happy by the end of the meal. Would definitely come here again 

The place gets packed so highly recommend making reservations beforehand"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Jules Bistro. Was part of a group of 8 friends. Anne was our server and was attentive, knowledgeable, friendly and fun. The wine list was excellent and our food was excellent too. I had the salmon and ratatouille which was fresh and perfect. My pals raves about the vegetarian onion soup and the tuna tartar. Oh, the desserts! Delicious chocolate mousse - great texture and right amount of chocolate. Would recommend and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for three years plus. Food is great.  Love the cote de boeuf and the Cornish hens.   Dessert is superb!  Eric and staff are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken club sandwich with French onion soup for lunch. Two thumbs up for taste and service. Price wise it's a bit expensive for what it was but overall a nice place."}
{"text":"SERVICE: I went with 3 friends and had reservations booked on a Friday night. When we arrived, we were seated right away and the server was friendly and provided us with menus and recommendations! Good service for a busy Friday night. I would recommend making a reservation to avoid a long wait.  

FOOD: I had the Cote de Boeuf for 2 and shared it with my friend, the portions are generous and filling! The Cote de Boeuf was cooked to a perfect medium-rare as requested and it was very flavourful and juicy. The fries were crispy and the salad was a nice addition. Overall reasonably priced for the amount of food that you're getting. 

AMBIENCE: Jules Bistro has a rustic and cozy vibe with the wooden décor. One thing to note is that the tables are quite close together, my chair was touching the person sitting behind me. It didn't bother me, but if you are taller you might want to keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"I've been there on several occasions. The food is always amazing; the grilled octopus is out of this world; service is fantastic."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Toronto. I go there regularly to eat or just have drink. The owners are the sweetest. They are very welcoming, always smiling, making me feel at home. And the food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"Underrated French bistro fare. Worth a second look

Jules is part of a line up of little boîtes along this stretch of Spadina, and between the nondescript signage and the mediocre ratings, I gave it a pass for some time. I gotta tell you though, mah yelpers, this place is a tasty spot for some simple French grub.

I avoided writing it up after my first positive experience, to ensure it was repeatable. But last week's early dinner of spicy steak tartare and salty frites with a half liter of Beaujolais on the patio, while all pretty simple, was exactly what the doctor ordered. 

The gotchas are minor and quite forgivable. My servers have been friendly, but not prompt. The caesar dressing is vegetarian (no anchovies, boo) but they were quick to volunteer to add some to the salad and add they did - four nice, healthy anchovy filets. Nom nom nom. Their beer list is short, but local and tasty. Their french onion soup is unconventional but also unimpressive, give it a miss.

This place is solid, y'all. My girl Kat F dinged it, and I have nothing but love for her, but that was 3 years ago and it seems they have grown. They're not La Palette nor Le Select; if you want those things, go there instead. They are a simple French restaurant, but they get the job done.

Pro-tip #1: If you dig on raw, the spicy tartare is the business.
Pro-tip #2: Beaujolais is such a peasant wine, but great for gulping on a patio, and cheap.
Pro-tip #3: Places can grow as much in 3 years as people can. You are *way* better than your 2009 self. So, it seems, are they."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of coming to this place with my YEA to celebrate a special occasion.  It was the perfect spot for dinner whilst trying to escape the frigid temperatures outside on a Saturday night.

The room has a good vibe when you step in with the exposed white brick walls, chalkboard menu hanging, and the mix of sit-down tables or having a front row seat at the bar.  It feels welcoming.

When we sat down, we noticed the table was a bit wobbly but one mention of it to the service staff and they fixed it quick.  No need for me to DIY.  The service staff was on point the whole night

We browsed through the couples prix fixe menu, the solo prix fixe menu, and then the a la carte menu.  Everything looked yummy and we eventually decided to just go with the a la carte.  Let our tummies decide what should be nom'ed for the evening.

We started with the deconstructed french onion soup and it was a perfect starter.  It gave us some much needed warmth on the inside to protect against the frostbite conditions outside.  It had a lot of onions and croutons with a good helping of melted cheese hidden beneath the surface.  

Next came the good serving of beef tartare with lots of crusty bread and a side salad.  I like that it isn't as tangy with the mustard and citrus as others that I have tried.  The beef was minced well and it had good enough seasoning on it too.

Then came the star of the show, the 8 piece premium rack of lamb. *drool*  They didn't ask us how we wanted the lamb done (maybe it's place where they know what's best :-P) and it was cooked medium-rare to medium.  It was accompanied by a huge portion of fries and lightly dressed salad.  The lamb was really delicious and I just dug in to the lamb lollipops with my hands.  The lamb was sat on top of more of the crunchy baguette bread and sprinkled with slices of roasted garlic. Me and my YEA really enjoyed sharing the lamb lollipops 5-3 haha.  Couldn't even bring ourselves to finish the fries because we were stuffed. :-)

It was a great experience and we were really satisfied with our choices for dishes."}
{"text":"Rather cramped, and service is kind but slow, but the food is delicious. It's not super incredible value, but it's very reasonably priced. Most of their daily specials were sold out by the time we got there. 

Food breakdown:

The onion soup was a tad salty, but tasty.

The steak was seared nicely, very flavorful, cooked to our desired doneness, and came with very crispy frites.

The salmon was cooked beautifully. Medium well? Something like that. Best cooked salmon fillet dish I've had out. 

The steak tartare was fairly generous in portion, although I could have done with quite a few more toasted baguette slices that were slightly less toasted. I like my toasted baguette crispy, but not super dry and crunchy. These were unfortunately the latter. 

The creme brulee passed the spoon tap test. I didn't have to stab it really hard and it cracked beautifully. I could do with it slightly less sweet, but for most people, I'd see it being perfectly fine the way it was.

All in all, it was a nice meal. I'd come again, especially for the steak."}
{"text":"This is the type of place you take your parents, as it's nice but approachable, and not over the top pricing. In fact they do a 3 course Prix Fixe for $28.95 which includes a variety of options sure to please most palates.
I had the Caesar Salad, Steak Frites, and Chocolate Mousse dessert. Everything tasted good and the others around the table ordering the various other things to choose from all had good things to say as well.

Beyond the prix fixe they do have a standard menu and a large amount of specials (at least 4 appetizer specials alone!). Beer menu had Kronenbourg Lager and Blanc both on tap (keeping true to the french roots) and a handful of other bottles and cans to choose from. 

Most importantly, they have a quaint and mostly enclosed and heated patio out back. So even though it was a bit chillier than typical patio weather would allow for, we were able to enjoy our meal comfortably.

Recommended for family dinners, but also has potential to be a good date spot."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend and we both tried their prix fixe menu. French onion soup as starters, steak and chicken for the mains, and chocolate mousse and creme brule for desserts.  Overall, it was a good experience: the food wasn't amazing but good. I guess you can't expect much from getting french food in toronto.

Food: 3/5, my chicken was good. Her steak was too salty and the onion soup was odd. It was served on a bowl as if it was concocted from a large pot.

Service: 1/5, nothing out the ordinary but the waiter was sloppy. His elbows on me and dropping cutleries on my lap. (And the restaurant is not small where you don't have enough space to take and being dishes)

Ambience: 3/5, nice joint and not bad seating (somewhat old)

Price: 2/5, not sure if the food was worth $30+ per person without drinks for what I got.  It's priced almost like a fine-dining but it wasn't."}
{"text":"Lamb shoulder, chef's special....out of this world. The flavour, the tenderness of the lamb was superb. Done to perfection.

I eat here often and every dish is consistent and flvourered perfectly- branzino, cornish hen, cote de bouf and so on. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service, food and price point match up in terms of being terrific!  It's great that Toronto has this gem of a bistro; I don't live in the area, but I can imagine it's a neighbourhood favourite. Our server was professional and friendly, the food was served promptly and we never felt rushed. We enjoyed the pre-fix and had fish, and it was nicely prepared and delicious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Over the years I've come to associate French cuisine as an elaborate affair with master chefs preparing works of art for cultured high rollers. And finally, Jules gave me a taste of what Southern French comfort food really means.

With a modest exterior, I have walked past Jules numerous times before without noticing it but this unassuming place is really a hidden jewel. Bursting into life once you step inside, the environment is extremely cozy and buzzing with people. Love the authenticity & simplicity of the menu and restaurant concept. 

We ordered the Cote de Boeuf for 2 ($58) and the mouthwatering spread of steak & fries really outdid themselves.  Perfectly medium rare and well rested, the meat is really tender and deliciously seasoned. Only call out is that the steak was quite fatty with almost a bit too much visible fat layers but hey.. Made the meat super juicy and fatty-icious. With a sizable heaping of fries and salad to complete the meal, our bellies were thoroughly satisfied.

Can't wait to be back to devour through their menu. Putting my money on the rack of lamb next time!"}
{"text":"24oz ribeye a la Cote de Boeuf. Best steak frites of my life--tender, juicy, fatty, flavourful, perfectly medium rare. If you like McDonald fries, these frites will be up your alley. Sauces are additive to your meal, so yes: USE THEM.

Such a good amount of food for 3 women! Much value! Gogogo!

*Queen location seems like it's easier to get a reso on a Sat night. Booked a 9:30pm seating at 8:12pm."}
{"text":"Words can't express how much I love this place. Dinner here is definitely special occasion fare, but I'm always trying to make excuses to visit! The grilled octopus starter is buttery soft and the shareable mains (I've had both the cote de boeuf and rack of lamb) are phenomenal- simple but delicious. The atmosphere is warm and inviting while still feeling classy. I had a friend from Paris tell me this was the best French food he found in the city and I certainly agree it's the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Venue: Jule's Bistro
Specialty: French
Menu items: Boeuf bourguignon avec les frites & Crepe au Chocolat

I have finally had my first personal food experience with one of Julia Child's famous recipes - Boeuf bourguignon!
Upon watching and reading about her famous recipes, books and now movie (Julie and Julia) I have finally been able to not only find a restaurant that offers Julia's Boeuf bourguignon, but also serves it to perfection and great taste.
 
Boeuf bourguignon (love pronouncing the name by the way) has been on my \"to eat\" list for quite some time. And thanks to the lovely French bistro, Jules, on Spadina and Richmond; I have finally been able to try it. Delish!

Boeuf bourguignon, also called beef Burgundy, is a well known traditional French recipe. It is a stew prepared with beef braised in red wine, traditionally red Burgundy, and beef broth, generally flavoured with garlic, carrots, onions and mushrooms. Although the presentation leaves a lot to be desired, it is really all about the taste when it comes to this dish. Trust me, you won't care how it looks like after you try it.
The meat gets settled and marinated in the stew for hours ahead of time. So much so, that the meat falls off the bone just by touching it with your knife. Then you put a piece of it in your mouth and this is when you realize French cuisine does not get its popularity for nothing, neither does Julia. The broth is tasty, not too salty and not too greasy. The meet is flavourful and fresh. 

The dish was accompanied by les frites (also known as French Fries) and green salad.

Jules' frites are by far the best French fries I have ever tried. Think McDonald's (not a fan of the place, but one has to acknowledge when the fries are good) but BETTER. It is the fancy, healthier and tastier version of them. Simply a must ask when you order anything at Jules.

For dessert, I had their Crepe au Chocolat.

The Crepe was fresh and tasty and the chocolate sauce was very French. Dark, rich chocolate sauce, not overpowering and yet sweet. Although I am a big critic when it comes to Crepes, this one passed my test...so it goes on this blog!

Bueno Provecho!
Viviana."}
{"text":"Wow. Great cocktails, wonderful waitstaff. Veal chop on point. Solid bistro. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Coming here after the Rec Room, Jules Bistro focuses on contemporary French cuisine.  Located along Spadina, parking can be an issue and it can be easy at times to overlook this place. 
Inside, the ambiance gives it a rustic, warm yet classy feel.  With featured menu items written on the huge chalk board walls, semi-dim, robust charm and vibe it's no wonder this place is popular. 
I highly recommend reservations due to Jule's popularity.  
The service is cool, calm, collective and always willing to go above to please its patrons.
For foods J and I had their grilled octopus, was not bad, partially charred, laying on a bed of arugula and aioli it was a good dish!
As for mains, I decided to go light and order their Tartar, being a fan of it, I found it perfect, complimenting my French beer in hand.  Overall I'm glad our party decided to come here for dinner.
Ambiance - 4.5/5
Food - 4/5
Service - 5/5"}
{"text":"This place is non-pretentious, high quality, casual, tasty and elegant all wrapped into one. That's what you get when you serve french food that is what I imagine my local french bistro would look like, except it's like in middle of tourist spot.

This place has all their menu items on the boards on the walls, which in the evening with sun shining sometimes the glare can make it hard to read it.

I hear they have some happy hour steak frites, will have to come here for that.

But I had the Cote de Boeuf and the Magret de Canard.
The Cote de Boeuf, this is really good. 24 ounces of AAA rib-eye with bone with salad, fries, some veggies. It was cooked to perfection.
But then the Magret de Canard, from what I hear not always available because of availability. We're talking pan-fried and then roasted duck breast.
Each was $55 and is a shared portion for 2.

Ask for their spicy mayo, it really adds a not so spicy kick to the fries.

The service was quite nice and helpful. Recommend to come here."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and came promptly after we ordered. I ordered the lamb for two- portions were generous and lamb was seasoned well. The octopus appetizer was also delicious and extremely tender. The waitress we had was friendly and helpful :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is truly enchanting and the wine list is magnificent. It is a cozy place for a wonderful meal or a romantic drink."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. 

The first time by recommendation 2 years ago by a friend. So I decided to host my birthday dinner here. It was a mistake. Though they can squeeze 20 people in a long table, it was tough to carry a decent conversation with the noise and echoing. The kitchen was also having some difficulty serving all of us (let alone getting our tuna steaks cooked perfectly to our liking). I wouldn't recommend it for large parties.

I came here again the second time last night because I remember my dinner being pretty good the first time around and I was in the area. I ordered \"steak and frites\". It was flank steak. How can you go wrong? This time around I tried their Steak Tartare and it was really good. No food poisoning yet! Preparing Steak Tartare is tricky, like sushi, ingredients need to be fresh and the kitchen has to be clean otherwise you risk spending the evening with the porcelain god or at the hospital. I also drank half of my friend's French Onion soup. It was really good. Not too cheesy. Not too salty. We also shared the Creme Brulee. It was DELICIOUS!!! Creamy, but not too rich. The caramel top was not over powering either.

As for some of the comments noted previously by other fellow Yelpers... their fries are not the highlight. Though there is resemblance to McDonald fries, they taste nothing like it. It's much crispier here... little to no salt. You can add as much or as little seasoning as you like. They do have a nice mayo sauce worth dipping your fries into for a change.

The service was good. At least the server I had was very nice and very attentive. Perhaps because it was a late on a weeknight. It was still busy. Most tables were seated by the time we arrived. No complaints.

I would definitely go back again, but only in a small group, no more than 4-6 people. Next time I'm going to try their crepes."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a girlfriend on a weekday and had a fantastic time! 

We got the steak frites and the chicken frites both of which were very good (pictures below) and we got the blueberry pie for dessert. The fries here are amazing.

Good food. Good ambiance. Great service and great company. All in all a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Staff are great, management is lacking.

The food is good. The management is where this restaurant fails. 

I have never been asked to move tables between my main and dessert purely to accommodate more guests. I would have assumed they figured out their advance reservations before they seated me.

Their entire card processing system was also down so we had to go to a neighbouring store to get cash to pay for our meal. 

We got 1 prix fix for 1 with the steak frites and a regular steak frites and that was an eye opener. 

The prix fix steak frites comes with an appetizer and dessert but  the no ratatouille or salad. The only difference is that there is a pause between your appetizer and main and you get a dessert. In my opinion that was a little deceiving.

Overall serving of food was slow too. 2.5/5 experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend searched up Jules Bistro for a double date with our friends. We all love french cuisine so we were excited to try this place out! Service was excellent.

DRINKS:
* Angels Gate Cabernet Merlot (red) & La Francette Sauvignon  (the girls)
* Kronenbourg beer  (for the boys)

GRILLED OCTOPUS (4/5)
So delish! We chowed this appetizer down very quickly - we all loved the sauce that it was marinated with. It would be nice if the octopus was a bigger portion haha!

GRILLED SHRIMP (3/5)
Came with bread and a bunch of garlic pieces.

COTE DU BOEUF (5/5)
(24 oz ribeye, frites, mixed greens, ratatouille, spiced mayo)
Highly recommending the côte du boeuf - the meat was tender and juicy; every piece was already sliced up for you! The taste is very addicting. Great for sharing.

RIB EYE STEAK (5/5)
(This was on the special menu of the night)
Similar to the côte du boeuf, the meats were marinated deliciously. It came with sauce on the side (it's for the frites as well); you wouldn't really need it because the meat itself is already really tasty!

DESSERTS:
Crème brûlée (3/5)
The crème brûlée was okay - wasn't as sweet as I'd like it to be :P"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Took pops here for lunch today. 

Waitstaff were all very lovely but they are a bit disorganized. Too many fingers in the pie. One person acting as hostess, 1-2 different waiters, one person setting/clearing tables, another person bringing the food to the table - mistakes are bound to happen.

We were seated quickly but I had to wave them down after waiting 10 mins to get them to take our order. There was a slight mess up on the food order, they gave my dad the wrong sandwich. 

However, the food was all quite good - I had a Nicoise salad, pops had a borscht soup of the day and a steak sandwich. Everything was really nice. 

The decor is very french bistro and it comes across as quite authentic, I would assume real french owners, which is nice. The acoustics in the room however are quite horrible, and it's hard to converse as noise from other tables is quite overbearing. 

The server compted us a portion of our bill due to the sandwich mix-up, which was appreciated. Lunches here cost around $13-$15 a plate plus tax and tip, so fairly reasonable."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service.  You actually feel like younger in France.  Great wine list.  Busy for lunch on Fridays.  This is the best kept affordable French cafe secret in town."}
{"text":"Awesome big portions of Steak-Frites. The menu says it is for 2 people but it is definitely enough food for 3!  Love that it comes with fries, salad, and ratatouille."}
{"text":"Great place, nice ambiance. Had the steak frites and it was amazing. For the money, Best Steak Frites in Downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto. The vibe is great, the staff are wonderful and the food is always - like, every item on the menu, 100% of the time - perfect. To be fair, I get the steak frites 90% of the time, but its a gem of a dish.

The owner is a sweetheart and runs a tight kitchen. He has surrounded himself with a stellar GM in Dylan, and an overall friendly & fun staff. I've never been disappointed with Jules and dare say that you won't be either. And if you're in the 'hood, you can order take out too."}
{"text":"Cote De Boeuf - amazing! 24 oz rib eye, cooked medium rare - the texture and flavor was perfect. Good portion for 2 or 3. Comes with skinny fries (like McDonalds' but crispier), Salad (good mixed greens), and Ratatouille (would've preferred warm)

French Onion Soup - big portion, different from the usual cheese-covered version. This one was broth + many large croutons, some green onions, some bits of cheese. Not bad.

Crème Brulee - quite sweet, served cold

The $24.95 3 course prix fixe is such a good deal. French Onion Soup (or Caesar Salad) + Steak Frites (or chicken/salmon) + Crème Brulee (or Chocolate Mousse). The flank steak is good, quite similar to the Cote De Boeuf except thinner, and it absorbs more of the herbs flavor. 

Overall: Cute and casual French bistro environment; simple, basic dishes at a range of price points to suit your budget/mood. Will be back!"}
{"text":"A little ho hum and nothing to rave about. The prices are good and I suppose if it was located around the corner from me, it might be the type of place I could frequent. However, it is not and I will not go out of my way to return in all likelihood.

I've heard the steak frites are good, if you like McDonalds frites."}
{"text":"Terrible kitchen service! Would not go back there (read on). 

The appetizers were good and the quiche was particularly memorable - super light and fluffy. 

When it came to the mains, we ordered the Magret de Canard and three Côte De Boeuf (medium rare) for the table. All three steaks were served medium and you could tell the meat had not been rested when it was cut because one side was more pink while the other side was grey. The entire inside was also overcooked and super dry. We wanted to send all three back, but decided just to send one, so at least one of our steaks could be cooked properly medium rare. 

The waitress brought it to the kitchen, then rushed back with it, insisting it was just the lighting in the room that made it appear overcooked. She was clearly nervous and also dropped a sauce tin on my friend's finger and phone in the process. We still sent the one steak back. Our friends have dined here several times before, always ordering the Côte De Boeuf medium rare and were never disappointed until this time. 

The chef was pissed and decided to send us a new piece of steak served rare. It was still cold in the centre. We didn't want to continue sending food back, so we just chalked it up to an a-hole chef with a big ego. Only a few of us were able to eat it and did claim it was better than the medium steak, but it was still too rare for anyone to eat a full piece. See the photos attached of the medium steak and the rare steak that came afterwards. Neither were medium rare like we asked for.

The chef was definitely angry the whole time and tried to stare us down from across the room by his kitchen counter with his arms folded at his side - like he didn't have anything better to do... he kept doing this throughout the night. 

We didn't order desserts or extra bottles of wine after that and just wanted to leave. 

Terrible experience. None of us will be coming back and they've just lost some regulars too. Chef needs an ego check."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just as cute as can be. Such a great place for an affordable date night or a casual dinner with friends. Their prix fixe menu is a steal and I can't recommend it enough! Oh and the service is phenomenal, the sweet girl laughed at all our dumb jokes and was so helpful along the way.

The steak frites was delicious, each fry was crisp and just the perfect size. I found the steak a bit thin and on the chewy side, but it was still really well seasoned and thoroughly enjoyable. The starters on the set menu (salads and soup) were all pretty forgettable, but that creme brulee was delicious. I also tried a bit of the veal chop special and the salmon and both were very tasty! 

All in all I had a blast--such a lovely atmosphere with great food and friendly service. I'll definitely be back. 


Pro Tip: Bringing a cake for a friend's birthday? There's a small fee per person. ($2.50 I believe)"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on a Saturday night and they said they were pretty fully booked but managed to sit us down for one hour. We ordered the Côte de Boeuf and it was delicious! The beef was so soft, juicy and marinated just right- not too salty or peppery. The only downside to the beef is that it was pretty fatty. But even if I cut off all the fat, there was enough meat to fill me up. Onto the fries, it was nicely seasoned and it taste like a healthier version of McDonald fries. It also came with some mayo and ketchup to dip into. The salad was nothing special, just normal salad but you can always upgrade to Cesar... Lastly the ratatouille was average. It tasted like pasta sauce but it gives a good contrast to the rest of the food.

Overall I really like this dish as it was enough food for two and everything was seasoned just right! Definitely a hidden gem in Toronto. Next time, I want to try their desserts. They looked ."}
{"text":"Good little spot.  Really really good service but the food was just OK

We both had the prix fixe menu and here's the breakdown:

Caeser was excellent
French Onion Soup was none to o flavorful but not bad

Steak frites:  Heavily seasoned and a bit chewy...Fries were OK but not very hot
Chicken in mushroom sauce:  A bit salty but the fries on this plate were hotter than mine

Creme brulee:  GREAT!
Chocolate mousse:  Also very tasty!  Very rich dark chocolate flavour.  Good stuff!

All together a nice enough meal, but far from over the top (But again, relly friendly server and quick service!)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, cute ambiance and warm service. These are some of the things that make Jules Bistro great! Had dinner here tonight and ordered their dinner for two, $40 per person. We started off with scallops on a crustini, with a lemon reduction. We then had a rack of lamb, with crispy fries, ratatouille and salad. There was enough food for three people easily. The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection, pink inside with a nice crust. Everything was seasoned well and I loved the lighter dressing on the salad. We finished off our meal with dessert. I had a crepe with melted dark chocolate and my fiancé had a chocolate mouse. He said it was very decadent. Their wine and beer selection could be expanded but for what they have, it's great. They also have a 3 course price fix menu which was also very popular tonight. The flank steak with fires looked delicious. Haven't been back in years, glad I stopped by tonight!"}
{"text":"They obviously don't understand that salmon tartare is not salmon+dressing. The pieces were way too big and the seasoning was not impressive. Not worthy of the price.
And my bf ordered the creamy mushroom chicken and the plate was a complete mess; half the fries and salad were drenched in the sauce which wasn't even impressive in any way. 

We also suspect the fries were from the McDonalds down the street."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favourite places to eat in the city. Their beef and lamb boards are phenomenal and their desserts are so good that they often sell out. My recommendation is the lemon tarte - while it's very tart, lemon lovers will truly enjoy it. Although our favourite waitress Clara is no longer there, the service remains very good!"}
{"text":"Rather noisy but the service more than made up for it!  The steak frites were cooked and seasoned to perfection (just divine)! My only gripe is the beer selection could have been slightly lengthier (a few more local crafts would have been nice). Overall, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place serves decent food, but not for the prices charged.  Overpriced, and the portion sizes do not reflect any extra pricing.   The value just isn't there (take the steak with frites for example, it's over priced, and a cheap cut of meat too)."}
{"text":"My friends and I surprised my boyfriend for his birthday at this location. We made RSVP about a month prior to the day, luckily for me, I was able to get them to contact me after several unanswered calls for days... just to found out they didn't have us on record. Imagine showing up with a party of 12 and they didn't have tables for us, it would have been horrific. We were greeted with a nice stuff except for one tall male server who seems to have a bit of an attitude. Our food was a hit and miss, our steak came out to be extremely salty and a friend's salmon came out over cooked (which was eventually replaced). They charged as an extra $2.50 per people (a total of $30) for the cake we had brought... which they also ruined... the ice cream cake came out 50% melted, they also had pre cut the cake but not properly... which we struggled to distribute ourself and it got messy. It was an okay experience, wouldn't be my number one pick."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a date night looking for some good steak and we found it! This was amazing! We order the Cote de boeuf which was a rib eye steak for two, with fries, salad, and ratatouille. It was cooked perfectly, and everything was so delicious! 

The servers were very nice as well. Great experience overall"}
{"text":"Good restaurant for a week night  or casual friday. Atmosphere is very warming and the waitress was very knowledable. Usually busy but not overly which helps make the place more warming of a dinner

The food is 3.5 starts and great but not great however its comparables in the walking distance area ie. Marben, le select bistro are more expensive mind you and maybe I have simply develop a flavour. Order the special shrimp and scallops which were both well done, well cooked and had that green onion taste common slightly north on spadina which was nice to add to the food given the location of the restaurant on the south end of spadina. Great job! The veal bone in was also delicious and I recommend. The frenh fries are mcdonalds fries and I wish they were different for somethin in this area or at least a different option. All in all good though.

My only downer here was the wine menu which jumps in price  drastically between bottles and of course the cheapest two (tables choice not mine) were sold out so you were stuck jumping up. Other than that great all arouns meal and restaurant.

Recommend: group's of 4 to 6 casual dinner and drinks. Jeans and a dress shirt or nice shirt. Youll be in good hands"}
{"text":"I came back a month later for lunch and I mistakenly ordered a steak again. What officially turned me off was that I ordered the Ceasar Salad and opted for steak instead of the chicken. When I got my bill,  I was charged for the steak frites but they substituted the fries with the salad. Weird. Never again. Bye!"}
{"text":"Love this place...in my opinion they have THE BEST Duck frites in downtown Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the price fix menu with my gf. For around $25 you get an app, a steak and a dessert. 

The service was friendly and the meal was alright. Nothing really all that stood out to me but I felt that the steak was rather thin and the fries seemed like the same kind that I can purchase from the grocery store. I liked the seasoning on the steak tho. The creme brule was nicely done too. I liked the environment and decoration of the store as it sets a good mood for some conversation"}
{"text":"Never noticed this place having walked by a few times. Jules Bistro is located right around Chinatown on Spadina with a small french storefront. The restaurant itself gives you the French vibes and the service was great. 

We had the following:
French Onion Soup - way too salty for me
Salmon - This was crispy and tasty. I didn't really like the fries as they seemed a bit cheap
Veal Chop - seasoning was a bit too heavy but overall this was pretty darn good - same comment re: fries

Give a shot if you are looking for some french food. 

I came back for the highly recommended COTE DU BOEUF a few months later and it was fantastic"}
{"text":"Quaint place to have a romantic dinner or catch up with a close friend. I ordered the steak frites. Asked for rare and it was cooked perfectly. Our waitress was lovely and attentive.  It got quite busy after 8 pm on a Friday evening. A nice place to dine downtown, away from the pretentious crowd."}
{"text":"This place has the best Steak Frites in town under $20 - guaranteed!

On my last outing, I went with a few friends and we shared the Côte de Buf and it was amazing. I would highly recommending it to anyone. We also shared the Pate and Ratatouille apps which were really good too...

All in all, Jules never fails to satisfy."}
{"text":"Have you ever hesitantly decided to try a restaurant and an hour or so later you felt sorry that you made that decision ? Well I exactly had this feeling. The French onion soup was so greasy that it was impossible to taste the soup. Just an inch of grease on top. The stake tartar was  just ok. But the made from frozen fries just made the dish not ok. The desert was nice and freshly made and that is the only reason I give 2 stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Had my birthday here. the owner asked the whole restaurant to sing me a birthday song. Their food is amazing too for the price. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, cozy setting and great service. 

I am from Montreal, spend my life between here and Europe for work and believe me, this is as close you will get to an authentic French bistro. 

To start, I really like the ambiance of the place. Shabby chic, huge blackboards with the menu written on, open kitchen and you have Eric the owner walking around the tables and entertaining the patrons. It's also one of the rare place in the city where I can get served in French, that's always fun :) 

And the food, oh you won't be let down! Try their rack of lamb for 2, served with fries, ratatouille and veggies. Meat is cook at perfection and very good portion served on a cute wood plate. 

They also have a prix fixe option for 25$. I highly suggest the chicken breast served with mushrooms and parsley sauce. 

Never got disappointed with their french fries. Crispy, not greasy at all and great taste.

Their desserts are also amazing, particularly their crême brûlée. You can taste that it fresh, light and made the same day. 

A good place to go with friends and a date. Maybe not the first date though, the place can get a bit too loud sometimes."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a weeknight and made reservations. 

Restaurant is quite small and narrow. Tables are quite close together. 

Adequate service - friendly and attentive staff. 

Started with appetizers which was spicy tiger shrimp and pan-seared scallops. Yep, they were both OVERCOOKED, way too chewy... especially the scallops. It was quite unappetizing to be honest. 

I ordered the steak + frites and my friend ordered the veal chop (recommended by the server). The steak was well cooked to my liking which was medium rare. The fries and the garlic aioli sauce was quite delicious. We both enjoyed our main courses."}
{"text":"I've always been vocal about my love for French food and restaurants. Jules is no exception to this rule. It's cozy, bustling at lunch, authentically French, from the servers to the chefs to the owner who speak to each other en francais and make you feel a bit like you've escaped across the pond despite being right in the hub of Toronto on Spadina. 

Great for lunch or dinner, a date or dinner with friends, or just a glass of wine at the bar by the kitchen to chat with the staff. I have fond memories of all these instances here. Plus take out for lunch! A small patio in the warmer months - what more can you ask for?

The quiches are lovely and reasonably priced with salade verte, soupe or frites! Ooooo la la, the frites here are amazing!!!!! Perfectly salted, soft on the inside a bit cripsy on the outside, this girl's favourite kind! I'm not a mayo fan but my friends that are adore this side with their fries. I admit, I've gone there more than once at lunch just for these! 

Mussels are tasty as are the salads - Niçoise being my pick. Crêpes, steak frites, and of course no French menu is complete without a croque monsieur (and many other tasty sandwiches) - Jules has something for everyone. Even this veggie has options between quiches, sandwiches and salads. 

The wine list is small but lovely. By the glass, half litre or bottle. Not fancy but elegantly upscale. J'aime Jules!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was beautiful, service was quite slow and it can be difficult to flag down servers at times. 

I got the prix-fixe menu for $28 but I don't think it was worth it nor it truly represent what Jules Bistro offers. In my opinion, it would be much better to order the other dishes on the menu, such as their highly rated Cote de Boeuf for 2 ($58) or the rack of lamb.

-Chevre Chaud
the salad had a simple and light vinaigrette which complimented the bold flavors of the goat cheese. I liked how the cheese just ooze out a bit and the bread wasn't too crispy either.

-Steak frites 
The steak came out perfectly medium rare and the meat is really tender and deliciously seasoned. The fries were a bit similar to McDonald fries, though they are much crispier here with little to no salt. The mixture of mayo and ketchup sauce was worth dipping your fries into for a change

-Mousse au chocolat
The mousse wasn't too sweet with a light and airy texture, and had an intense dark chocolate flavor - which is how I like it."}
{"text":"Anyone that knows me could guess that this darling French Bistro has a special place in my heart of hearts. I've been dining here on their tasty crepe and quiche lunch and dinners my entire adult life. The owner Eric has managed to create such an vibrant and welcoming place to dine, that trying your luck for a walk-in is nearly impossible these days its so bustling with life and warm laughter, so I would most definitely book ahead. The love is so mutual that the manager Dylan pointed out one fine day that I had a delicious drink named after me 'The June '74', its on the hidden menu if you fancy something uber sweet & strong."}
{"text":"We decided to try our luck and walked into Jules on a Saturday night around 6:00 without reservations. There was only one other couple dining at the time so it wasn't busy at all. This location looks a lot nicer than the one on Spadina and was a great date night pick. The hostess told us there would be another party coming in at 7:30 and we agreed that we could finish our meals by that time. I originally wanted the cote de boeuf (which was priced higher on the physical menu than on the online menu) but decided on the prix-fixe at ~$29/person.

To start, we got the french onion soup and caesar salad. I thought the soup was way too salty but otherwise, not bad. The salad had a nice tartness and tasted fresh. Our entrees were the steak frites and chicken with mushroom/ cream sauce. While the steak was very thin, the medium-rare cook on it was good and the end result wasn't chewy. The sauce for the chicken was delicious and I ended up dipping my fries into it too. I can see why a lot of reviews here say Jules' fries are similar to Mcdonalds but the former tastes a lot better! Our desserts of the chocolate mousse and creme brulee were nicely executed but nothing special. 

Overall, I'd give the food 3 stars but the fast service makes it a 4-star meal. Everything we had was good and simple but I did want a little bit more to each dish. Still, I'd definitely return to have the prix-fixe again - its such great value."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to have lunch with friends. It is French without the music and decor. The menu however can be read in French. I really liked the glass bottles that the water was in on our table. The glasses didn't look clean at all and I cringed while drinking from it. It was not too busy at noon on a Friday afternoon. I was disappointed with the length of time it took for lunch to be served. The waitress was not even that friendly. She seemed to just be doing her job. I never had quiche and decided to give it a go here. The waitress failed to inform me that it was cheese and bacon quiche. A lover of bacon would have liked it because it was packed with so much of bacon. It was however very delicious. The pastry was crusty and it was quite rich. The fries are the signature item here in my opinion. It was so tasty and just thinking about it makes me want to have it all the time."}
{"text":"I must admit that my visit to Jules was over 2 years ago, but I still remember the details of my visit vividly....I had the grilled tuna for a late lunch-seating was not an issue-and it was perfection...the vinaigrette...it's been 2 years and I still remember! The service was cold, but all was forgiven with the delicious meal and awesome crepe with caramelized apples that I had for dessert...and the coffee...great even though I had it black..my cream and sugar request would apparently offend the beans and my dessert, I'm glad she ignored my request! All in all, should I find myself in Toronto again, I will definitely go back. As a matter of fact, I always recommend it to friends that travel there and to family that lives there, nay I insist they go."}
{"text":"Favourite french spot in the city. Get the steak and frites for your entrée, and crème brule for dessert."}
{"text":"Jules is as close to Paris as you can get in Toronto. It's not fancy but food is outstanding, especially the desserts. Wine list is not extensive but it has great choices. I like to sit at the bar and watch the cooks. Service is friendly and knowledgeable. Busy place so maybe reserve."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday, made a reservation half a month before (which I recommended doing, it's SUPER busy). Ordered Lamb for Two, and a birthday cake for us, we enjoyed the food so much and the service was great.

At one point, we were both very sad. Because the table next to us ordered Lamb for Two, BUT they didn't even look at the ratatouille or touch it!!!! When the waiter took it away, we shed a tear. OTL"}
{"text":"I might be the only person on the planet who doesn't swoon at the mention of Paris, and by extension, France. Yes, it has the Louvre and Sacré-Cur, the food - nutella crepe sandwiches, baguettes warm, crusty and fresh, cheese, bottles of wine, steak frites, - and walking from Montmartre to the Eiffel Tower, but overall, Paris was rather wet (it was raining non-stop!!) and gray, and a bit unfriendly. And so, Paris has never made the re-visit list.

Until Jules.

Located on Spadina and Queen, in downtown Toronto, entering Jules felt like what I had imagined Paris would feel like (before I went there): charming, casually (rustically, even) elegant with a certain air of je ne sais quoi (nonchalance maybe?), a little bit of amusement in the atmosphere. They had jazz music playing the background, but there was also the bzz bzz bzz of random conversations floating in the air that added to the ambiance. A large wooden table was placed on one side of the room, smaller tables on the other, and several tables outside on the patio for a warm summery day. Most of them were full. There were some people who were dining alone, not at all out of place. There were also some groups chitchatting away, very much at home.

The menu is written on chalkboards hung up on the right side of the wall, above a row of small, square, intimately placed tables, and has the best selection of all the comfort French food you could want: steak frites,Côte de buf, cornish hen, veal chops, a wide variety of sandwiches, quiches and crepes, and for dessert - pies, creme brulee and cake! Altogether, a casual, welcoming place that deserves to be the gem that it is.

After eating here (we had the Côte de buf for two, with the juices from the beef sopped up by airy, crusty bread, and spilling onto the shoestring frites and salad), all you'd want is a cigarette in one hand, a glass of wine (or coke) in the other. You take it for granted that the conversation will continue. The night should never end. You feel satiated. And indulgent. As though you had the best thing going, and all the time in the world to enjoy it. And that maybe, just maybe, it might be time to go visit Paris again."}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner after a show last night ... grilled chicken was ok ... boneless, skinless chicken breast was hot, juicy and tasty.  Fries were not hot.  The real problem was the steak tartare.  This dish should be chopped by hand with a sharp knife for each serving; we watched as they put the flank steak for the tartare through a meat grinder.  Two issues here: the meat grinder didn't chop the meat, it turned it into a fatty smear. It had no texture whatsoever, and tasted overly of ketchup, which apparently they add to the mix. The other issue is that unless they wash the meat grinder after every serving, it seems to me that there is a food safety issue here.  A machine that sits around for hours with raw meat clinging to the inside of it being used to grind meat that is to be served raw sounds, well, unsanitary.

Unlike some other reviews here, though, we found the service to be very good, and the servers were quite professional and understanding about our concerns with the tartare, and did their best to make it up to us."}
{"text":"MAKE A RESERVATION. 

I've been to Jules a few times now and have always enjoyed the food (the three course prix fixe is great.) However, I had a very bizarre experience recently that has deterred me from visiting ever again. It might have been a one off but nevertheless left me with a very negative impression. 

I called in to check if they had any availability on the Saturday for dinner and a guy said there aren't any reservations available but if we come by later at night around 8:30 there may be some spots.

When we arrived around 8:30pm, we were greeted by the hostess. She was very odd in her behaviour and turned us down immediately despite the fact that there were several tables that were finishing up and I had asked if there were reservations booked for those tables to which she said no. 

After a few seconds of AWKWARD silence where she made no effort to help us, I finally suggested if it's possible that we put our number down and they can give us a call when those tables finished - to which she reluctantly replied \"Ok fine, but sometimes I forget to call.\"

... ???

I almost couldn't believe her response at that point and wondered how exactly she still has a job as a hostess. It's kind of incredible."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The atmosphere is so intimate and welcoming and the ...out of this world. I love bringing a friend to share the Côte de Boeuf.  And perfect for those with a dog at home; bring the bone home for your friend too! 

A Jewel in the big city!"}
{"text":"Went there on Friday. Prices are fair and reasonable. We order the steak for 2 and the octopus.  

The octopus was poached with butter, which made it feel heavy and very buttery. Not my favourite but it was well executed. 

The steak was a great portion. It was well cooked and they had frites that were very thin but delicious. The owner was very friendly and was moving around to say hi to all the patrons."}
{"text":"I came here for a team lunch and I was glad that they let me book for 15+ people. The restaurant is quite small so I was surprised with how quick their service was and we didn't feel too crammed despite being a large group.

I ordered their Grilled Albacore tuna and it was pretty good. The tuna was grilled perfectly with a charred crispy exterior and light pink centre. They did give me a lot of fries and salad so I didn't end up finishing. Some of my colleagues ordered their steak but it was only okay, even when it was recommended by their servers.

Can't say that their \"French\" cuisine since it's not really that French but decent food."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. 
Food came quickly 
Restaurant is a good size
Had the asparagus & brie creme which was absolutely delicious!! 
Also had the onion soup, I would give that 2 stars only!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and quiches though the prices are a bit high for their value, especially for takeout. I most recently ordered the Asparagus and Bacon Quiche ($15) which comes with a side of salad, soup or fries. Tip: it's possible to choose half salad and half fries! It was tasty and rich as is expected for French but I did find the overall size on the smaller side. If you're expensing though, go for it!"}
{"text":"This place is what it is supposed to be. And if you have soul and discretion, you'll understand what I mean by that. 

Please note the one-star reviews are from a group of four people (three of which basically wrote the same one star review). Their complaint was that they showed up at 7:12, there were several empty tables and they were not given one. They were informed these tables were being held for a large party with a 7:00 reservation. It upset them that the good people of Jules would not disregard their commitment because of a little tardiness and give them a table. 

God forbid these people proactively make their own reservation. I guess their time is better invested griping on the Internet. 

So if you agree with the people who wrote the one star review, Jules is not the place for you. It's better that you never go so you don't waste your time and, more importantly, so you don't ruin a great vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"WOW this place is PACKED.

They serve ceveche !!! Tons of great options for sandwiches , appetizers, and entrees! All at a relatively reason price.

Tons of people come and indulge in just a glass of wine. The environment was a little more than a bistro. I love how it's a more casual hang out spot considering it's french food and normally they're a tad fancier."}
{"text":"Not considering the dessert and french onion soup (both which were great), I didn't really enjoy the steak. It was overcooked and pretty tough. I've had much better flank steak from home which weren't as chewy. Perhaps it was an off day for them and I'm still awaiting the chance to go back to try it again. The fries were on point though."}
{"text":"WOW what a hidden gem! I honestly had no idea this place existed, but a friend chose to host her birthday dinner here and I enjoyed it immensely. Like where have you been all my life?! For a little-known, inexpensive French bistro, their steak here is ON POINT. They have a pretty diverse menu, and you can score a great deal by ordering from their $24.95 three course prix fixe menu. Most of my friends got this with steak frites as their main and said it was pretty good. My recommendation though if you have someone willing to share with you is to get the cote de boeuf ($58), which is apparently much better, according to our waitress. This is a 24oz slab of rib-eye beef with fries, salad and ratatouille on the side. It looked mouthwateringly impressive when it first came out, and we weren't disappointed when we started eating because the beef was sooo thick and juicy and cooked to perfection. For two people it's definitely more than enough, as I was not grossly full, but definitely satisfied. I also enjoyed the fries which were the thin and kind of crispy kind.

I still had room for dessert so split the creme brulee with my friend. This was not too memorable to me, and I wasn't even sure if it was fresh because it was totally cold, not even the layer of caramelized at the top was warm. Still would recommend this place though! It's super cute on the inside and feels pretty cozy, and the wait staff were all really attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"excellent! Chef has a very cool and fun attitude. Offered my girlfriend a free glass of wine. And sex is allowed in the washroom. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Just okay. For the price it's fantastic but the food was just okay. The steak frites and grilled salmon were good, but no different than what most people could cook at home. We'll be back again since we enjoyed our time, and perhaps it was an off night."}
{"text":"The goat cheese bread was tasty but very small. We had the steak flank and the salmon. Both tasted exactly how we cook them at home, and we're not even good cooks. I thought I would be getting something unique or special at a french restaurant charging me 40$ a person, but no, it just tasted like home cooked food. The deserts were tasty though."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Jules and had a great evening. The food and service were exceptional and very friendly. The meal wasn't mind blowing so I can't give it a 5, but it was dam good and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place on Queen and spadina! I made a reservation but was told tables were unavailable and the only place left was the bar. Initially I was skeptical about the seating, but because it was an open concept kitchen, we ended up getting food and a show! The prices are pretty good for the quality and amount of food. We both had the fixed price menu and it was definitely worth the money. I'm definitely planning on coming back and trying some more of their food!"}
{"text":"Oh I'm taking you down a notch, Jules. Two notches, even.

A dinner party of 25 planning to monopolize the entire restaurant's seating was more than 15 minutes late when we arrived looking for a table of four for a quick bite. A British, poor man's version of Keram Malicki-Sanchez (http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelmovies/images/0/06/KeramMalickiSanchez.jpg) smugly told us there was no way he could accommodate our group, too bad.

We ordered a side of fries ($6.20) to go from the counter lady who didn't really speak English and could hardly be described as friendly. I reverted to French when I sensed her struggle but even that didn't warm her disposition. The word \"arrogant\" comes to mind (it's used to describe several items on their menu, go figure). When she rang up the total she tossed the bill in my general direction and it landed on the floor, to which I replied \"Oh, was that my bill that you just threw at me?\" No response.

Hey, at least the place is authentically French. Va donc chier, Jules!

P.S.: In a double blind taste test, two testers guessed that the fries from Jules were from McDonald's. Eerily similar, yet $4 more expensive."}
{"text":"We stopped here as part of the Yelp French Fry Crawl 2. I say stopped, because we didn't actually get to sit. Apparently a party of 25 had booked a reservation for 7. We were there... 7:15?

Okay, so we're not happy about not being able to sit, fine. Kat gets take-out fries... and winds up having the bill thrown at her. Excuse us for partaking of your establishment.

As for the food... I'm sorry, but if your fries aren't as good as McDonald's - and these ones looked the same but tasted like McDonald's fries that had gone slightly off - I find it hard to believe you can handle anything more complicated than dipping potatoes in hot oil."}
{"text":"Super Southern French Quisine. Both the interior and backyard patio are very casual and fun yet cozy.
The owner is present and greets the patrons in a warm, welcoming style.
All of the waitstaff were terrific and helpful.
The caesar salad was very tasty.
We ordered from the fixed price menu-the skirt steak. It was delicious and done perfectly.
They have an extensive wine list."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed our evening out at Jules. The food was very good as was the service-- I had little chance to complain. Well done to the staff and the chef."}
{"text":"I had an amazing meal here while on a work trip, and surprisingly affordable for a french bistro. I opted to do the pre-fix menu plus an additional bowl of soup and everything I ate was spectacular. 

The french onion soup is just the right amount of salty and didn't suffer for flavor despite being a vegetarian broth. Although I wouldn't have minded more cheese, it was refreshingly healthier than your typical. The salad with a goat cheese crostini was also excellent, although the size would not be worth the price if you weren't ordering off the pre-fix menu. The chicken was warm, flavorful, and I loved the creamy mushroom sauce. The fries it came with were good too, especially soaked in the sauce. I ended with a fabulous chocolate mousse that I was very disappointed to be too full to finish.

The bordeaux by the glass is an excellent, full bodied red. It paired excellently with their food options."}
{"text":"I give this place 4.5/5. Great service, and great food. I've been here at least 3 times and I love the food and the atmosphere. My go to dishes are the octopus appetizer and the côte de boeuf (steak, salad, fries - served for 2). The price is reasonable and the food is phenomenal. Can't wait to come again"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I've been here several times now, and they always have great vibe and delicious food!

ATMOSPHERE: A long narrow unit on Spadina, alongside many other eateries, this one has great charm and warmth. Decor is a little rustic, with lots of wood and glass. The seating from table to table is very close-knit, so beware of knocking into things (yes, it's happened to me!).

SERVICE: Generally good service. Having been here many times now, I do find the service to be a little inconsistent - depending on who is on staff during your particular meal. Usually they're quite good - refilling the glass water bottles for each table often, and checking in regularly with their patrons. There was a couple of times where during busy dinner hours, service was much slower and difficult to find anyone to help you. This is the sole reason why this review lost 1 star. But overall, the pace is fair and enjoyable.

PRICE: Average/Fair. My friends and I tend to favour the prix fixe pour deux (for two), but there are also prix fixe for one. The Pour Deux options are the best deal because you get 3-courses: 1 appetizer to share, 1 main (I almost always go for the Rack of Lamb - because it's just fantastic!), and 2 desserts. That's right: TWO desserts.

FOOD: So great! Love their steak frites. Steak tartare is great as well.

But my favourite, as revealed above, is the rack of lamb. It's incredibly flavourful, perfectly pink and tender - and all beautifully plated on a wooden board along with a bed of shoestring fries and veggies. And the portion is very generous! Every time I introduce a new friend to this place - this is the item we order.

Often, I'll start with the seared scallops. Scallop is one of my favourite seafoods, so I'm biased. But every time I order it - they're delicious, and large scallops.

Desserts: the crepes are decent. I prefer their chocolate tort and creme brûlée. Size is perhaps not as generous as their main course, but it's just enough to cap off a great meal.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A little bump for the French jewel of Spadina and Adelaide, Jules. 

They are super accommodating if you have to make large, last minute reservations, and their moules and frites are delicious. 

Merci, petit bistro."}
{"text":"A local gem!! It's often rammed, but that's a good sign!! 

The food is pretty legit!! Steak et frites is the signature dish. Then there's the rack of lamb, mussels et frites, and their quiches all favourite of mine!! And their homemade mayo is sooooo good!! 

The location is great, Spadina and Richmond. They have a tiny patio in front that's open when it's warm. I love having a drink and meal while people watching. 

The staff are usually quite friendly. Not had a bad experience!!"}
{"text":"Went on Good Friday, made a reservation for 7pm but it turned out to be unnecessary because the place was only half full (it started to fill up around 8pm). We were sat at a table for 2 that's TIGHTLY sandwiched between 2 other tables for 2. Difficult to get in and out. Uncomfortable is an understatement.

Ordered the $29.95 prix fixe menu. Husband got the onion soup (very minimal presentation and unlike the trad. french onion soup, so lower your expectation, but he said it tasted pretty good). I got the warm goat cheese bread on a bed of mixed greens - simple yet refreshing and I enjoyed the tang from the cheese. We both got the steak & frites as mains. My flank steak was cooked to a perfect medium. The dry rub on the steak complimented the meat really well. A little disappointed with the fries because they looked and tasted like a store-bought. For dessert, husband got the chocolate mousse which he really enjoyed. It was light and smooth. I got the creme brulee, which is not my favorite dessert (there was no other choice), but the custard was delicious and so creamy, so no regret there.

This place is known for their cote the boeuf (serves 2), which you can have as prix fixe for $40.95/person. We were happy with the $29.95 menu as we got a good amount of food and left the place full but not stuffed. Didn't order drinks because the cheapest 5oz wine is $11/glass but the good ones start at $14 per 5oz. 

Overall, it was an ok experience. I still can't get over their stupid table arrangement. There was an older couple that asked for a table for 2 and the server directed them to a table beside us that had no room to get in and out. I didnt know what he was thinking, trying to sit them at a table that's obviously inaccessible. Once the server turned his back on them, the couple left. I would probably do the same."}
{"text":"True to its name, Jules Bistro is a non-pretentious restaurant that serves excellent French food. This warm, cozy nook on Spadina makes a great date night or a fun place to grab dinner with friends. The ambience is noisy, warm, and stripped down, the only sign of opulence being a series of mismatched chandeliers that makes the place all the more charming. 

We got there on Saturday night, making reservations an hour beforehand and were promised seats at the bar. Thanks to the cold and many cancellations, we were able to snag a table when we arrived (yes!) and were walked through the specials: seared scallops and a grilled octopus for appetizers, veal chop for the main. Yum. 

They ran out of their signature dish, the Cote de Boeuf for Two, so we ended up getting the steak frites and the octopus instead. The octopus was cooked beautifully! So well-seasoned and flavourful on the inside. Probably the best grilled octopus I've tried in Toronto (sorry Gusto 101, you are now #2). The steak frites was also well done although a bit chewy. The slice of meat was a lot thinner than the Cote De Boeuf which the couple next to us ordered (could not stop stealing glances!)

Overall, we had a great time dining here and would love to go back to try their other dishes. Thank you for the great meal Jules Bistro!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Steak frites are delicious. Steak tartare is also fantastic. They have a decent wine list and the atmosphere is buzzy but not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Being French, they certainly do a great job if you're looking for your staple steak frites. Nice atmosphere, good service. Would come back"}
