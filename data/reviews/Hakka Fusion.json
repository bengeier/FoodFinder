{"text":"We always do takeout and have NEVER been disappointed.  Excellent food - very well spiced and even when the food is fried, it's still light.  Family favourites include the pakoras, pepper chicken, green beans, ginger beef and lemon fish.  There are never any leftovers."}

{"text":"Wanted to write about a recent incident which happened with my family on 22-Jan-2015. Went there around 9:00 PM to have dinner with family. The restaurant was all empty except one couple. First impression empty and not a warm welcome should have guessed something wrong. Anyhow wanted to give benefit of the doubt. Got the menu and ordered a few items. Cannot comment on the food as we never got to eat, was there for less than 10 minutes and walked out; but the customer service and the attitude was the WORST and non-existent   My 2 year toddler son was excited seeing the fish in the fish tank and expressing his joy just by clapping and laughing out of excitement remaining in his seat all the time (normal behavior from a toddler), when the waiter walked to me and asked me to tone down my 2 year toddler. I asked if there was a problem and how I could stop the toddlers excitement. He was not running around or breaking things just enjoying himself  watching the fish from his seat. I asked the waiter what the issue was , he said the customers will complain the toddler being loud !!!! I was shocked, first of all there was only one customer and they seemed least bothered. The one who seemed most bothered was the waiter and his other waiter. I even asked the couple if they had any issue with the toddler enjoying.  I clearly was shocked and didn't expect these words to tone down my little one; for a toddler enjoying himself. Anyhow I asked the waiter that he should put a board indicating \"NO KIDS\". I guess they need basics coaching of customer service and how to treat customers especially kids. When I complained that I was not happy with the attitude he seemed least bothered and the other waiter seemed least bothered too. I told them I want to leave and will write a review and they seemed least bothered and told me to teach manners to my 2 year old toddler and even asked me leave the restaurant. Manners as he was excited seeing the fish in the fish tank and expressing his joy !!!! This was unbelievable. He was showing me the way out.  Anyhow a strong warning to anyone especially families with kids to think twice before entering this establishment Hakka Fusion. Save yourself a trip and your respect. Also for others customer service here is something that is not heard of. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Hakka yes, fusion, not so much.  We ordered three things from the menu:  1. Spring Rolls, while it was a good serving, we got 4 pieces, but they weren't the best spring rolls I've had, so they can definitely do better when it comes to spring rolls.  2. Vegetarian Manchurian Pakoras - They weren't that great at all, although I love manchurian (This is true indian/chinese fusion food) but it didn't live up to my expectations at all. They could've made those manchurians about half the size and used less flour and corn starch and cut the vegetables finer to add more flavour, instead all I could taste was the corn starch.  3. Vegetarian Hakka Noodles - Great noodles, this was well made and was very flavourful, if it wasn't for this dish I would've been forced to give them 1 star instead of 2.  Service was excellent they were around when required and weren't too pushy with anything.  Overall I won't go here again as there are other Hakka places in town that have better flavour, I just wanted to try these guys out because they are much closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Don't believe the reviews here. The food was absolutely terrible. We ordered chilli chicken hot and sour soup and American chop suey. Chilli chicken is a staple at every hakka restaurant and some how they managed to ruin this. The soup was only sour and was missing any ingredient which would have made it even close to mediocre. The American chop suey was cold and flavourless. I wouldn't even feed this garbage to my dog. The posts you read are probably written by family and friends"}
{"text":"As Hakka Chinese myself, I can't recommend this place enough. Great Hakka cuisine located in the suburbs of Pickering. This place rivals most Hakka joints in Scarborough and Markham (I've tried them all) and is owned/operated by Hakka Chinese! Only seconds away from the 401. Two words: Manchurian Soup. Probably the best I've ever had! Spicy and flavourful. Another goodie is the chili chicken. You can order them dry or with gravy. I recommend getting this dish with gravy, served over a bed of rice. So good.  A traditional Hakka Chinese noodle dish worth trying is fung mi mein (stir fried noodle with molasses soy sauce). A true staple in my household. If you love Chinese, Indian or trying new and delicious cusine, visit Hakka Fusion. So good, you'll be bragging about it!"}
{"text":"A great little Hakka place in Pickering! It's convenient for me (which is a huge plus, I won't deny it), but also a halal spot that does catering. I ordered some dishes for a housewarming party and it was well-done and affordable.  When having sit-down service, their servers are polite and observant, but not too aggressive. I've never ordered any of the Indian style dishes, so I'm not sure how much 'fusion' is really happening, but the Manchurian chicken, all the fried rices, and a number of the beef dishes are all great. Most are spicy, but not in a terrifying way that leaves you with burnt tastebuds.  I absolutely LOVE their hot-and-sour soup. It tastes even better the next day, if you have leftovers! I wish they'd stick in a few more shimp, but, hey, can't win 'em all..."}
{"text":"My husband and I have dined here twice. We're not hakka ourselves, but enjoy hakka food. It concerned me at first the place was empty, but we agreed the food was very good. It tasted fresh enough, although some dishes were more salty than others. I liked this restaurant more than spicy dragon because of the variety of mild to non spicy dishes. I"}
{"text":"My go to Hakka place. Best food at extremely reasonable prices. Would recommend to all. Chilli chicken is one of the best I've ever had. Also, as an Indian, I have a certain fondness for Chicken Corn soup. Suffice it to say, that the soup takes me back to a simpler child in my youth.   Management is super friendly and courteous. Would definitely recommend to try it out."}
{"text":"Went to the place the other night & almost didn't stay as it was empty around 7pm on Tuesday night.  Service was good.  They're trying.  Food was just ok, I've had better Hakka before in Scarborough & I would drive back there instead."}
{"text":"Hakka Fusion hides in a suburban strip mall at the corner of Brock and Kingson roads. On a Friday night, there were plenty of parking spots, and very few diners. However, they do a brisk take-out business, and the customers appear to be regular visitors.  All boded well for our first Hakka food experience! My son and I are well acquainted with other genres of Chinese food, and our dinner at Hakka Fusion did not disappoint! Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Our order was taken promptly and our food, very freshly prepared, arrived in swift succession. We ordered Spring Rolls, Dry-style Chilli Chicken (apparently, a dish that gauges the skill of a Hakka kitchen), Szechuan Chicken Fried Rice, Pepper Tofu with Broccoli and Garlic Green Beans. It was all so excellent! The spring rolls were crispy and not overly stuffed - a nice, light appetizer. The Chilli Chicken was crispy with a pleasant spicy nip. My son instantly overcame any hesitation that he may have had about Hakka cuisine, and took several helpings of Chilli chicken. The Szechuan Chicken Fried Rice was a spicier dish, vibrantly red, with a savoury smokiness. It was really unique and tasty.  The Pepper Tofu had a similar smokiness, and had a fresh tofu taste which was complimented, rather than overwhelmed, by the preparation. The beans were just great (dry-fry style, not raw tasting but full-flavoured, nicely accented by carrots, onion strings and garlic), and they complimented our meal so well. We were surprised to receive a largish bowl of steamed rice with our meal! Amazing service, and more restaurants should think about doing that. Finally, our portions were so huge that, despite totally stuffing ourselves with this great food, we actually have enough leftovers for another meal. Oh, and for anyone who is hesitant about taking children there, no worries! All the other dine-in parties who were there had young children with them. No problem at all. Of course, it was 6:00 in the evening, and you expect kids to be in a restaurant at that time. Staff was welcoming and courteous to everyone. A reasonably priced restaurant, with several good deals if you want to do take-out. We will be back very soon.  5 stars for sure: convenience; great parking; friendly service and brilliant food."}
{"text":"My first time here. Live the ambiance. Chairs have armrests (thank you). 2 lovely large clean goldfish tanks. Glass table tops all clean, good quality music sound system with lovely funky easy jazz, large screen tv up high with volume down.  Not too bright or dim, a large open comfortable space. Got a good  recommendation for lunch by my server after I requested something with shrimp. Tried the shrimp & lobster sauce. It was different than what I am used to. But was delicious with real garlic (not powder) large shrimp and a generous amount. Food came out quickly. It is open 1:00 Sunday afternoon  even though Yelp hours say it's closed. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food large quantity of food for reasonable prices , great environment hidden gem people should seriously come here more. Most importantly It is very clean."}
{"text":"We were driving past and based on a past nearby Hakka food experience (we d been served elastic bands covered in sauce in our dish and when we complained they did nothing, but I digress) i first looked up reviews on my trusty Yelp app. It looked good, so we went in. Glas tables were polished and immaculate, staff was super friendly and helpful. Manchurian soup was great, and everything we ordered was great. It had kick but was super flavourful. My new fave Hakka hangout!"}
{"text":"A little out the way, but definitely worth a trip if your in the area. While the spot may be a little bland in decoration they definitely make up for it in the food department. The portions are big that two orders of plates are good enough for 3 people. Definitely worth a repeat to try some other dishes but only if in the area."}
{"text":"I went with my sister here tonight Sun Jun 24 2012 to order take out.  Have been living in Pickering just around the corner from this restaurant since Sep 2011 and always wanted to try.  I am soooooo glad we did.   Awesome, AWESOME food!!  Staff were two young gentlemen, so helpful, patient, polite and super knowledgeable between the two of them about the entire menu.   We ordered the chili fish and it was outstanding, melt in your mouth it was just amazing will definitely get this dish again.   Also ordered the pepper tofu dish again another huge winner.  Very fresh and flavorful     And finally we had the Manchurian fried rice it was a great accompoaniment to the above dishes.    I must say I found my favorite Hakka restaurant in Pickering.   Excellent we will def go back often."}
