{"text":"Good place for hakka food. It's family style so it's perfect for sharing with a bunch of friends. I really like the chilli chicken here. Manchurian noodles were great too!

Pretty busy on a Saturday night if you're coming during the prime dinner hour. Come a bit before to ensure they seat your large party."}
{"text":"The value you get for lunch is pretty decent.

The waiters were polite and friendly.  I think the owners must have taken all the empty glass comments to heart as my glass was refilled at least 5 times, sometimes after taking just a few sips and then one last time as I was leaving.

The food isn't the best, but it is above average and very tasty.  I had general tso chicken.  The lunch special comes with soup, salad and a main.

This place is worth checking out at least once."}
{"text":"I ordered assorted party trays for 50 people and they were all delighted!!  The Thai Mango Salad was a huge hit, as was the Lollipop Chicken. We devoured the Hakka Chowmein, Beef with Broccoli, Pad Thai, Mango Delight, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Fried Rice, Vegetable Rolls, Chili Chicken, Thai Red Curry, Deep Fried Tofu and steamed rice. I had some folks with dietary restrictions and they were all easily and deliciously accommodated!  I will absolutely order from them again and cannot recommend them highly enough!"}
{"text":"Weekday dinner for four.
Mediocre food and service.
Server when requested to tone down a spicy Tom Yum soup retorted \"the chef will add more water\"! Duh? Another Neanderthal? 
Noisy families with more noisy kids screaming and running around...a nightmare not be re-visited...."}
{"text":"Been going here for two years now and never disappointed.  It does get crazy busy at time which affects service but never quality. Spicy garlic chicken is amazing and the Mrs loves there soups"}
{"text":"Amazing hakka food. We usually dine in here and never taken out. Food quality and taste is mostly consistent during each visit. They have a huge a la carte menu. We usually order sweet corn chicken soup, spicy cauliflower, chicken pakoros or lollypop, egg fried rice and cashew chicken (chicken with lots of diced veggies) and its all amazing. The meat and veggies are fresh. They do have some good sodas for summer months - fresh lime, blueberry etc."}
{"text":"This place is one of the really good hakka chinese restaurant's in sauga. Not only is the location large, and able to accommodate many people, the food is really good too! 

We ordered the Thai Manchurian, Manchurian Pakora style with gravy, Chilli Paneer with gravy, Chilli Chicken with gravy and the Szechuan Chowmein. The service was surprisingly quick for such a busy time. 

The Thai Manchurian was crispy and the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. The chilli paneer, manchurian pokara style and chilli chicken all seemed to have the same sauce type of gravy, but they all tasted great, so I have no complaints. One problem I had was...that we ordered around 6 items with gravy, but were only give two bowls of rice for 7 people and had to ask for extras. 

A big complaint I have about this place is that they dont accept credit cards...which is strange...because I am pretty sure  the last time I came here, we paid with credit card."}
{"text":"Hmmm I think Ryan might be too picky. As far as hakka food goes, this is one of the better options and they have the best deal I've seen (soup + spring rolls or wings + SIX dinner specials + a mediocre desert) for $57. The atmosphere depends on what time you go, can't really control the loudness on busy nights but it is clean. The service is excellent though, some of them are younger students but they really try hard and the weight time was long only one time I went on a Saturday evening.

I didn't enjoy some of the Indian style dishes much but the soups are amazing and their noodles and Chinese dishes are good. It's very hit and miss with Thai dishes at hakka places so I'd only recommend getting those if you're getting other stuff to try-out, I wouldn't order those by themselves."}
{"text":"Manchurian and Schezwan rice are really nice , thats what i have mostly had here so cant comment on other items lol"}
{"text":"Good food, Decent ambience, moderate prices and service depending on the mood. Overall experience is 4/5.
Must try Lunch Specials and family special deal on Fridays, Sat and Sun.
All food ingredients taste fresh and of good quality. My favourites are Tandoori chicken fried rice with Manchurian Chicken or chillie chicken ( ask for less spicy or mild if you cant handle chillies ). Thai Red curry can also be added to make your meal more asian. Average dish will cost about $11.00 + taxes. If you like Indian Hakka or Indo-chinese food then this place is a must to visit with friends or family."}
{"text":"I consider myself a Chili Chicken connoisseur... Love it. Would be on my last meal menu if I had to make one. Decided to Royal Jasmine based on some of the reviews and ventured out of my 6-Points burrow...

Got some for take out on a very cold Saturday Night the end of February... The lady took my order promptly and ushered me to the comfy seats near the door. The restaurant was clean, there were a couple of tables and it was around 6:15 so the start of dinner. My food came out surprisingly quickly after I ordered and paid... Maybe 6 minutes?... This should have been my hint - read on and you'll see why...

The portion was decent and the price was comparable to most places... The taste reminded me of China Palace in Malton, but I much prefer the style of China Garden or even Ming Room (RIP Hurontario Location)...

I was starved, so I gobbled almost all of it...

When I get food poisoning it's within 3 hours...

And so...

I had some of the WORST food poisoning ever 2.5 hours later. I mean horrible. Outside of seafood, food poising I once had from mussels, this was right the hell up there. I do not wish that on my worst enemy. I was supposed to go for drinks later that night but I couldn't even call to politely cancel because I was puking so hard. I wish I could tell you I was kidding. Or that I ate something else that bothered me that day. But the only other thing I ate was a peach coffee cake that I made from scratch that day and ate for the next few days after without issue. Hindsight... Questioning why my order came out so quick... Precooked food? Undercooked food?... Regardless, this restaurant is on my blacklist.

Pissed off because I wasted about $11.50, a night out, my weekend, and suffered with my stomach for another 36hrs later. Super disappointed because this is probably the closest Hakka restaurant to where I live.

Never again.

----------------------------------------
Obviously I had the date wrong and it was the end of Jan. I can scan my credit card statement if you want.

Guess what.

I'm not retracting. I was green for over 36hours after eating at the restaurant. Food poisoning affects everyone differently. I don't need to visit a doctor to know that I was sick from eating at your restaurant. I wasn't the only one who got sick from your food, but my best friend isn't going to open an account just to write a review because that doesn't look credible.

Take care."}
{"text":"Visited Oct 2011. Reasonable setting and decor. Lots of variety on the menu which is Hakka Chinese and Thai. Chose the set menu for 5 people (we were 4) at about CDN 64 inclusive of taxes. Includes Soup, Appetizer, 6 dishes plus big bowl of plain rice and finally platter of fried banana with ice cream. Enough to feed a group of 6 to 7. Great tasting dishes, big choice in The two cuisines, cooked to the spiciness you want and a price that cannot be beaten. Service was quick and friendly. Great experience and will go again."}
{"text":"It felt pretty royal, i believe one of the waitress' name was Jasmine, i guess thats where the name comes from!!! over great food and atmosphere, ate like a king!"}
{"text":"My favourite Hakka Chinese restaurant in Mississauga.

I LOVE their Szechuan chicken and their Hot & Sour soup. A lot.

The chow mein wasn't as good (better at Eddies, although I'm not a fan of that restaurant otherwise). I personally don't like Crispy Beef, but the rest of my party really enjoyed that. 

The last time I went, the place was very overcrowded and excessively noisy, but that's the fault of the customers in my opinion, and not of the restaurant's. 

I've found the ambience and service to be decent."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Hakka Chinese.  The restaurants are always hit and miss.  This one was a hit because of the variety of dishes and the cusines styles.  Large portions as expected.   Good quality food.  Everything held its own distinct flavour and the meat was soft not rubber and vegetables were crispy and not soggy. The kind of place I share with family and friends who love good old greasy Chinese food (fyi not that greasy but utterly satisfying).   Not five stars because decor is 80s style finishes and booths.   Will come back with family definitely and a great hidden spot to take guests who like Jones only the locals know.  It is typical run down joint that you forget is run down once the food takes over.  The guilty pleasure of greasy Chinese food only makes sense in a joint like this."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. Have had way better food from other places at a better rate."}
{"text":"Note: cash only! Have to walk to gas station nearby to get to ATM. Quick service and huge portions. The yogurt based mango drink was delicious. The Pad Thai meal needed more of a peanut-based sauce. I'd be open to trying something else here, but probably wouldn't order same dish again."}
{"text":"Went on a rainy day....cause felt like having Soup !!
10/10 on cleanliness 
10/10 on service and hospitality 
10/10 on food taste and quality.
This place has enough space for seating for a large group events."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Manchurian Chicken didn't have Manchurian taste. Manchurian soup did... weird....
Choupsy noodles could have been lot better. Great service. Will visit again to try other stuff :)"}
{"text":"Honestly they only cater to the needs of the muslim community... I walked in and asked if they had non-halal options and they said no..."}
{"text":"Great Hakka Chinese food. 

Love the General Taio chicken with veg fried rice lunch combo. 
comes with soup, salad, 2 veg spring rolls also. 
Food is good employees are awesome"}
{"text":"Came here and the server was very friendly she was trying to get us a booth but couldn't find one so she took us too a normal table which was not bad too after a while she came and told us if we want to sit in a booth which we said it's fine too the server took quick our order we ordered chicken corn soup which was very tasty and I ordered a small portion which was still enough for two people to eat the masala fried rice was to salty and the prawn manchurian was full with soya sauce the chili chicken batter tasted burned and I told to make it medium hot but it was still very hot couldn't eat that the food came with plain rice.
The place is clean and family friendly would but I wouldn't go again"}
{"text":"Ok folks this is another Hakka Chinese restaurant. I was their with family and the place is quite nice. It is very good for big groups and families. 

The food is decent and portions are good. We ordered multiple things from the menu and I don't thing we didn't like any dish. 

The service is not bad its not too busy. The server was friendly and good in taking the order. They brought the food in a reasonable time.

Parking is not a problem as its a part of a big plaza where you can find Swiss Chalet and Kandahar Kabab.  

For my fellow Muslim brother and sister. This place has a halal certification is also listed on the Zabihah site. But do your due diligence.

{"text":"So i would not say this place is any much different than other Hakka Places..  the menu selection is great!  It can get a bit noisy - but then we were sitting next to a family with kids and they were having a blast...  oh well, its a Family restaurant.

Would definately eat here again, I've been twice already.  The food can be spicy so be ready.

:)"}
{"text":"If you like hot and spicy, this is the restaurant for you. I personally think that this restaurant is single sided. It's like driving a car with one gear or your BBQ only able to cook on high. Some people like that, unfortunately, I am not one of them. Asian cuisine should be balance of flavours, Royal Jasmine balances only two, hot and spicy. 

On one occasion, I ordered the butter chicken, it was spicy. On the second, I wanted garlic fish, it was spicy. The hot and sour soup, spicy. I was surprised that my spring rolls and salad were not spicy, because it seems like that is the only thing that they can do. 

My first taste only emits spice, I can't tell whether the garlic fish, actually has any garlic in it. I can however, tell that it is fish. I want flavourful, I want balance, neither of which I get from my experiences at Royal Jasmine. It's like a junior cook had to sub for the masterchef, making the food technically proficient, as I can tell by the perfection that this fish is cooked in. The sauce hints at playfulness with my palette but alas, it is only a tease, as the junior cook's interpretation of Thai is to dump more chillies and chilli flakes into the mix because, \"Hey, we're THAI!\"

I've eaten here several times. Or rather, I should say, I have had take out here several times. On one of these occasions, I had time to spend it in the dining room waiting for my take out and I must say that the service was excellent. We were even given tea to drink, while we were waiting. 

I don't understand why this place has been around for so long. There must be a lot of people in Mississauga that like spicy foods, as this runs parallel to my mind of Wild Wing, but then again, Wild Wing knows that not everyone wants extra spicy hot sauce on everything and gives variety. Sadly, Royal Jasmine has not learned this lesson and for that, this restaurant is now dead to me."}
{"text":"Mediocre place.. Food was warm, shrimp was super tiny for a $2 charge! Taste was... Plain. would not come back ever again"}
{"text":"Pricey food
Lack of customer service
Don't accept any credit card

Food not great. My wife ordered manchurian Tofu. It was nothing but cooked in super salty soya sauce.

We are not going again."}
{"text":"- 2.5 stars.....
- not an expert in hakka in anyway - but it's a pretty decent/average and cheap option near my work.
- owners are definately hakka chinese... still trips me out to see a chinese dude speak english with an indian-accent
- manchurian chicken lunch set is a good mix of spice
- service is ok, but they're not fantastic at refilling water.
- p.s. upgrade to fried rice for the lunch specials. way better."}
{"text":"Pretty good Hakka Chinese food.  Fairly large restaurant and seems like they have a lot of staff working during the lunch hour.  Which is very good since this place is busy.  Was seated promptly and asked right away if we wanted our soups to start.  Which is great because of this polar vortex weather happening right now.  Since this was my first time here I got what I judge most Hakka places on...Chilli chicken dry and Manchurian chicken.  We got the lunch specials which was a bit pricier than other Hakka places in Mississauga but still a good value.  The food presentation is great because it comes in a sort of bento box that separates all the items.  

Chilli chicken dry is a good portion with large chunks of chicken, good kick of pepper, plenty of garlic and onions.  
Manchurian chicken I thought was good too but we like a bit more cilantro.  

Will try some pakoras other dishes next time."}
{"text":"Took a chance and tried this restaurant.  It was disappointing.  Food was very mediocre.  Everything seemed to have come out of a bag and then covered in premade sauce and goop from a jar.  It was so oily my stomach was upset almost immediately.  On the plus side the staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch twice and had two different experiences. Both times the food was really good. However, I have two food intolerances and told the waiter that I could not eat gluten or lactose. The first time I was there, the waiter told me I could only eat two dishes. I ordered a curry dish and was very satisfied. I didn't experience any discomfort after my meal and everything tasted delicious. 

During my second visit to this restaurant, I asked our waiter what I could eat with my two intolerances. The waiter told me I could order almost everything on the menu. This seemed odd to me. I ended up ordering another curry dish but there was one problem. About an hour into the meal I began to experience discomfort and the problems associated with eating lactose and/or gluten. 

I didn't say anything because I was with my colleagues but I really don't think a restaurant should be telling people they can eat certain things if they are not sure. I think the chef or the waiter didn't fully understand what gluten was.

I wouldn't go back to Royal Jasmine again because I felt so sick after and still had to go back to work and make it to the end of the day. 

I would definitely go someplace else where they know how to prepare food without cross contamination for people with food sensitivities or intolerances. It's unfortunate because the food was really good."}
{"text":"They have a really great business here. The food is top-notch, service is friendly and prompt, managers know exactly how to do their job and I've been there many times. My sister had her wedding rehearsal dinner there and I think they deserve a great review. Restaurant is clean and has a good atmosphere. Always busy, which means you know it's a great place. The waiters also have a story to tell. Owners know what make their customers happy. Try the chilli chicken dry, the butter chicken lunch special, and the garlic shrimp. There's a lot on the menu and the food is as tasty as it is consistent. 

Great job guys, I'll be back for sure, hungry for more."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Its my second time. We had the Sweet and Sour Manchurian Fish AGAIN and Manchurian Paneer. Both come with sticky steamed rice which is definitely a plus. The fish and paneer are lightly fried to give them that CRUNCH. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch with coworkers and LOVED the food. The Tandoori chicken dish is amazing.  Since the work lunch,  I have returned here many,  many times and it's always excellent!  Prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Exec Summary: Serves average Asian food, one of the few in the area for lunch.  Not a destination spot, but ok for lunch if you're in the mood for Hakka or Thai cuisine.

Would I go back? Only if my friends wanted to. If I were in the mood for Asian, I'd probably go to the Chinese mall food court at Dixie and Eastgate.

What should I get? The chili chicken and mango chicken were alright.

Eyes wide shut: I've never been in an Asian restaurant with such a multicultural mix of servers! 

Review:

A decent spot for lunch if you're in the mood for Asian food.   Royal Jasmine is one of the few Asian restaurants in the area, serving average Hakka and Thai food. It's not a restaurant I would crave or make a destination out of, but it's passable if you want Asian food and are in the area/passing by.

Combos come with soup, salad, 2 spring rolls, white rice and your dish, in a bento box. 

I tried the Mango chicken (Thai inspired) and it's was decent. Chicken breast meat with red bell peppers and mangos, it wasn't overly sweet and the chicken was cooked well.

My friends had the chilli chicken (the chili sauce was very good, though I didn't like the batter on the chicken itself) and prawn in lobster sauce, which was a bit sour for my liking.  

The salad and spring rolls aren't great, the salad being a few lettuce leafs with some onion sprinkled in, and the spring rolls' skin was too thick, and there was too much ginger and cilantro in there. 

The soup isn't bad, but it's definitely heavy on the MSG.  

It's fairly busy at the Friday lunch hour, but I didn't have to wait for a table.  The they have good selection of lunch combos, priced from 7.50 to 7.99 + taxes, so it's about $10 after tip and tax.  

Service was also a bit slow during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I am very old customer for this place and tried almost every thing on their menu, either on take out or sit in, but my yesterday visit has changed my views for ever, now I don't think I will go back to this place any sooner, altogether it's look like a south Indian restaurant with every thing compromised and worst happen when my wife found a long hair in her salad bowl, it's totally ruin our mood and hard to stay their any longer, I will not recommend this place to others as I used to do it in the past"}
{"text":"Good vegetarian options and was having a good variety/spread in the menu chinese, thai, indian, japenese etc. Though the food was tasty the service could be smooth and timely to earn more ratings."}
{"text":"I visited here based on a friends recommendation. & i enjoyed it. Service was friendly and quick. Prices were good.

Only downside is that they don't take credit cards. It's cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a colleague today and both our meals we good.
We had the Basil chicken and the Peppercorn steak combo's along with the Hot n sour soup.
Food was quick, hot and tasty .
Good lunch spot.
Place needs some updating to give it some life.
Our waiter was not very friendly at all.
Would go back and hopefully get a better waiter."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a friend and the first thing I liked about it was the service! I was ordering takeout and all the servers seemed extremely friendly. If you do go here make sure to say Hi to Helena. She has the best photographic memory, and will remember you and your name right after the first meeting! In terms of food, they have quite an extensive list of the regular Hakka Chinese dishes. The sizzlers are really good, and if you want it more spicy, they are more than willing to do that!!! Do check it out and if you run into Helena let her know that you were directed to RJ by Kevin lol. Enjoy!!'"}
{"text":"Dinner with friends...
First time visiting here..usual hakka place is Chilli Chicken House
While I think that is the best place for hakka Chinese in Mississauga, this place is alright too.
Very good serving size, a little pricey.
Ordered chili chicken: very good, spicy,
sweet and sour Manchurian chicken: very red, tasty, right amount of sweet
chicken chow mein: flavor not as good 
thai fried rice: what is thai about them; bland-ish; I think they had used some short-grain rice; not cooked well.
fast service"}
{"text":"Now this is Chinese food :-), Hakka Chinese, not a replacement of traditional Chinese.  I am a city boy, but I take any chance I get to go to Royal Jasmine. 

Food is tasty. Service is friendly. Restaurant is spacious. Tables are bigger than most Chinese restaurants and you get actual dinnerware and cutlery. They use Basmati rice and before you say anything, try it once :-).

I have never been disappointed. Some of the dishes I would dishes i recommend from the top of my head, Tandoori Spiced Chicken, Chili Chicken with Gravy, Manchurian Chicken, Sweet and Sour Manchurian Beef, Chicken Chopsuey Noodles, Chicken Corn Soup, Hot and Sour Chicken Soup and can not possibly imagine going for Hakka Chinese without Chicken Pakora .

Just go there, just do it. Even if you have never had Hakka, just go there and try it :-)."}
{"text":"This place is OK! I would only come here because of the fact that they offer halal food otherwise this is a very subpar Asian fusion restaurant with very poor food choices!!

we ordered some beef meat and it was extremely hard and very chewy also the curries and chicken dishes seemed like they were made with chicken nuggets dunked in a savory sauce that wasn't even that great!  it was definitely not a great experience and after having spent $85 I don't think I will ever come back!!!

the only thing that was half decent was the soup which was also covered with tons of Salt!

all in all I would rate this a 1/5!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best chilli chicken (no gravy) that I have tried so far.  It doesn't  taste like the normal breaded covered chicken, it tastes real.  I only give it a three stars though because the manchurian chicken we ordered was absolutely too salty to eat!  Plus, service time is slow and the establishment does not serve alcohol."}
{"text":"I have been here many many times and it NEVER disappoints. The server is friendly, fast and efficient. Spicy Chilli Chicken is my go to. Fantastic, fresh food at a great price."}
{"text":"Had to wait 10 minutes since it was very busy on a Saturday night but it was well worth it.

We had the sweet corn soup, tandoori chicken, schezwan beef, and shrimp fried rice. Portions were large and we barely finished it. Dishes were spicy, but not overly so.

Wait staff was courteous and would often come over and refill your glass with water (and you'll need it if you're not used to spicy food). Overall, aside from the wait, it was a nice place to check out."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've tried a lot of hakkah restaurants but this one is completely different. The food just has a different taste than others. I've been coming here with my family for quite a while now."}
{"text":"First time to Royal Jasmine today on the recommendation of a colleague. Decor was decent which was nice and the service was good. Ordered the Spicy Garlic Chicken lunch special which comes with a green salad with soy/sesame dressing, 2 veg spring rolls and hot/sour soup. The soup great, it had noticable coriander which was a very nice touch. The spring rolls were fresh and crispy and salad was good. The rice was slightly on the dry/undercooked side but that is how I prefer it. The chicken was pretty spicy (compared to Hakka #1) but really good. Portions were smaller than comparable places but still enough. I'd come back."}
{"text":"We ordered spring rolls,garlic shrimps,chilli chicken with gravy,haka chow mein with chicken and shrimps,small bowl of hot and sour soup,every thing tasted gross esp garlic shrimps and chilli chicken glued in gravy and I don't know what part of chicken has been used,there was no flavour,spring rolls smell bad,it was a complete waste of money.Noodles are bad as well.My advice don't do take out or dine in such a expensive restaurant where they have extensive menu list but produce no good quality food.Never going there again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a much belated review (I could have sworn I did one before!) 

I went to Royal Jasmine for the first time about 5 years ago. A friend of mine suggested that we meet up here. I tried their Hakka noodles and fell in love. To this day, I have yet to find anything comparable in the US. 

Fast forward 4 years, I take a few friends of mine to Royal Jasmine... THE SAME. We went back to Royal Jasmine two days in a row and I even brought some back to the US. 

I have never tried anything else but their hakka noodles but I never have felt the need to."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch the other day - pretty good value, $10 including tax and tip...I ordered the yellow/golden curry, which was tasty, but not really a thai yellow curry.  I would definitely go back.  The food and service are not bad for that price!"}
{"text":"Chicken corn Soup,Manchurian chicken, manchurian noodles, chili chicken, crispy beef and their veg fried rice !! OMG amazing. Huge portions! Their won ton soup was the best but they took it off not sure why. Overall amazing tasty food best Hakka in town!"}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant, kind of loud.
We had the special with appetizer, soup and 6 entrees. 
Hot & sour soup - 3/5 star
Thai chili chicken - 4/5 star
Shrimp fried rice - 3/5 star
Chicken manchurian - 2/5 star
Kung pao beef - 2/5 star
Chicken chow mien - 3/5
General Tao beef - 3/5

Quantity was ample how ever quality was lacking. Service was excellent. Meat was not trimmed there were lots of fat still on the meat."}
{"text":"So for lunch today we decided to go to the Mexican Post... Little did we know the Mexican Post is no longer there.  Instead, popped up a hakka restaurant called royal jasmine.  We were there anyways so we thought we'd give it a shot.

First thing about the place that we noticed was that it was pretty much exactly the same as it was before (minus some sombreros and decorations).  Guess they kinda just moved in a set up shop asap.

The lunch menu was actually very extensive for their \"special\".  Their lunch menu actually consists of a \"bento box\" of salad, 2 spring rolls, soup, rice and a \"main dish\" which was separated in one of the bento box's segments.  It was quite interesting because there was an Indian side of the menu, and then a Thai side.  

First thing out was a hot and sour soup, which to my surprise was actually pretty good.  Wasn't too overpowering on either end, but I did notice a lot of cilantro in it.  I overheard someone say \"what soup do you have today?\", so I can only assume that they switch it up daily.  My guess is a corn and egg drop soup.

I ordered the tandoori chicken \"meal\".  Really all the meals are pretty much the same but the \"main dish segment\" gets filled appropriately.  One thing I guess to note... this is not really a place that specializes in either Indian or Thai, it's kinda both.  I wasn't really expecting a super authentic tandoori chicken dish but I was actually pleasantly surpised.  I wouldn't really call it tandoori chicken, but I'd say it was kinda like a spicy chili chicken (with tandoori flavouring).  I guess this is the \"hakka\" part of it shining through.

Did I mention that the whole lunch was 7.50?  Amazing!  And if you're a cheap tipper you can probably get away with a ton of food for under 10 dollars!  I love it.

Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"lots of parking so don't worry about it...parking lot right in front of the restaurant.

very friendly.

i wouldn't necessarily call this a chinese restaurant...but they are close enough.  I really liked it.  maybe because i was REALLY REALLY hungry both times i went here.  considering there is only a middle eastern/lebanese restaurant next door.

basically it was all the same veggies they had in EVERY dish.  Little broccoli, peas, carrots, bok choy...a little bit of corn...the peas, and corn come from the frozen section, you can tell with one bite...but again, i really liked this place.  Again, I was VERY VERY HUNGRY.

they are open very early...and stay open until very late.

the young lady behind the counter is EVERYTHING so she is 5 stars.

not saying anything bad about someone..but when he was there, it seemed like he was part of the mafia and sent there to watch over the store...as if they had other things going on besides the restaurant...hmm, sounds like a restaurant near home that got shut down for such dealings.

well, what can i say?  the best thing here is the chow mein...apparently its not typical...and they are all the crispy, pan fried style...which IS AWESOME!

anything they serve with cashews made it a PLUS also."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying this is by far the best Hakka Chinese Restaurant you will ever find!! They are Halal as well 
This place is nearby to our house and once a week we either dine in or take out from here (the staff knows me by now, heheh!) 
But jokes apart, it's a great restaurant, there are many great dishes to try from, we personally order the Chicken Schewan Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka Chowmein, Chilli Chicken Gravy, that's our usual order. Also the Chicken Lollilop and Manchurian Chicken is great. Don't miss the Hot and Sour Soup and American Chopsuey as well. Manchurian Chicken Gravy and Chicken Ginger Gravy as good as well. 
The quantity is sufficient for 2 people. However please note that the food is spicy, like the Chilli Chicken Gravy comes with Chilli pieces and can be really hot!
The place is packed on Weekend nights and it's difficult to get space, moreover they do not do reservations so you end up waiting, sometimes over half hour. Also even though the space is big, it can get crowded and noisy. 
But It's totally worth the wait and the money you spend and it won't disappoint you for sure !!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my second visit in about 3 months.

We ordered the lollipop chicken which was pretty good the first time. The second time I think it may not have been fried for as long because the breading or dough was not completely done.

We also ordered the Japanese noodles with has shrimp, chicken and beef. Tasted as good as it did the first time. A lot of the items here are pretty spicy, but the Japanese Udon noodles aren't too spicy.

The mango lassi is pretty good to have while eating spicy food.

I still plan on visiting again because there are so many other menu items I see passing by my table that look interesting."}
{"text":"Great place for the price....

Very economical and delicious food. I wouldn't rate it as high as Edie's Wok but, for the price and convenient location, there is no alternate to this place.

I have been to this place at least 10 times, and never had any complain. Always felt, money well spent, and my boys love the food.

We usually order Chicken Corn Soup for kids and Hot and Sour for adults.
And then most of the times, without ordering any appetizers, we move on to the entrees, which mostly include:

Chilli Chicken Dry ; Manchurian Chicken ; Cashew Chicken; Thai Chilly Chicken
Crispy Beef House Style; Thai Chilli Beef (Crispy)
Spicy Garlic Fish; Fish Chilly

Everything tastes good and feels fresh.

I have never tried their Shrimps, so I really can't comment on that. 

Please do remember that as Muslims, we have very limited choices in halal foods, so when I say the taste is great and the restaurant is perfect, please DO NOT take these comments literally, as I am only comparing these restaurants against other HALAL restaurants :-) My comments are based on the value for the $$ and the limited choices in halal foods."}
{"text":"I came for lunch during work week. This place was no where found in my radar until it was shown to me by my friends. What a find! 8.99 to 9.99 lunch and a plentiful amount of food!

Their lunch menu is loaded with delicious food.  I opted to get the spicy garlic chicken and it was quite flavourful. It's served with 2 spring rolls, salad, jasmine rice and the main spicy garlic chicken. It was enough for 1, it left me satisfied an wanting more.

The place was clean and huge! Loads of parking space. Quick service and very polite servers. I would definitely comeback here again and enjoy a good time during lunch!"}
{"text":"Basically still the best Hakka place I've been to in terms of food quality (dinner menu) and service - never had a problem getting a table, flagging staff, payment, etc. I tend to avoid the weekends since it's usually crazy busy and chaotic the amount of large families that reserve seating, which is not their fault tbh, so try to come earlier in the evening if you wanna avoid that mess. 

Here's an updated list of Hakka restaurants I've been to across the city that are still not as good as RJ: Federicks, Chili Chicken House, Super Hakka, Chung Moi, Lin Garden, China Cottage, Kim Kim, Tangerine, Wang's Kitchen, etc. Name any Hakka place, I've probably been to it and it likely still doesn't compare to Royal Jasmine."}
{"text":"Good indian Chinese and dinner portion is pretty good. I ordered a small bowl of soup just for me, he still gave us extra  bowls mentioning I might want to share it with my 3 and 1 year olds...:).

Tandoori fried rice was sooper.. Kinda fusion."}
{"text":"One of the best Hakka restaurants in Mississauga!!

Always packed with customers, very lively atmosphere, quite prompt service and good food. They have a good selection of Hakka Chinese dishes, and the good part is, you can customise the taste, spicy, very-spicy, mild..... We love the Tomyam Soup, it's really spicy but mouthwateringly delicious!!

We have been there many times, and always found consistency in quality, taste and quantity. The servers are well mannered comparing to most of the Hakka restaurants, and it's quite clean.

If you like to taste Hakka... it's surely a place to be recommended."}
{"text":"We did takeout and the food lived up to expectation.  The Manchurian Noodles were a bit oily but not bad.  The service seemed to be friendly and the food had good portions.  Place was jam packed with many people waiting in line on Sat night.  Glad I was picking up instead of waiting to sit."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Food was very nice and tasty and the restaurant was clean. So in short it's a nice Indian Hakka Chinese place to go"}
{"text":"First time here, very mixed experience.  Food, excellent and in huge quantities.  Hot and Sour soup (both chicken and veggie), General Tzo's chicken, Hakka chow mien, shrimp fried rice, and Manchurian shrimp.   Spice level was good, the Manchurian shrimp was spicy but not overly hot.  Food was excellent and plentiful.  

Now the bad part, this is one of the noisiest restaurants ever.   It was difficult to talk to anyone at the table without screaming.   While there were a few kids there, the main reason for the noise level was all hard surfaces, nothing to absorb or diffuse the sound.  

Second issue was we sat right below an AC vent and it was freezing, may be a different story on this at any other table.  

Third issue was reservations, we made a reservation and due to traffic we were going to be a little bit late, we called to let them know and we found out we had no reservation, got a reservation 30 minutes later but when we arrived early we were seated immediately. 

Unlike other reviews, i didn't have a problem with service, I found it somewhat slow but it was very busy and the service was well within expected timeframes given the crowd.

Final note, this restaurant is halal so no alcohol is served."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Sunday afternoon. The place was packed but luckily we got seated right away. Good quality halal hakka food. Particularly enjoyed the chilli chicken gravy. The hot and sour soup was tasteful as well but the phad thai unfortunately wasn't. That's alright, as a hakka place primarily, they don't need to serve thai food but it's nice to have it in the menu. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"They know their cuisine, they know their spices and they know what's spicy! :D I have never seen such perfectly balanced flavours bringing a party to my mouth! Everything we ordered - lemon soup, bombay chicken sizzler, garlic paneer to noodles - was sooo delicious! The quantities were huge so prices were extremely reasonable! There was a wait but we got through quickly enough since the service was swift and efficient! Will definitely visit here or make a detour to eat here! :) :D"}
{"text":"I go there often for lunch. Have tried limited items from their menu. If you can handle spice, try their tangra chicken. Definitely one of their best. Also priced very well."}
{"text":"Everybody loves Hakka food. Even you. So if you're in the area looking for Hakka food. This place has it. 

All kinds of chicken and beef. Tofu and rice. Noodles and fish. Fried and grilled. Baked and boiled. Mostly delicious. Partly nutritious. Probably fresh. 

Apparently they also have Thai food. I was ignorant to this fact. Perhaps I will stop by again soon."}
{"text":"Best Hakka Chinese in Mississauga. Each time we wonder to try new places, and ultimately we end up at RJs. It's a nice casual atmosphere, with decent capacity. So even on busy days, you get a table relatively quick.

Food: Always consistent. Lots of options for Vegetarians, practically any dish can be made for Veg. by substituting with Paneer, Tofu etc. Our favourites appetizers are: Spicy Paneer, Mango Salad, Thai Style Pakora and for mains: Schezwan Hakka Chowmein, Manchurian Pakora and Paneer Fried Rice.

Service: Usually good - tends to suffer on busy days. You may have to grab attention of your server a few times. Pretty standard for Indian restaurants.

Price: Very reasonable. Portion sizes are at par with Chinese restaurants. 1 order is usually good for 2-3 people."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting take on a Hakka/ Indo-Chinese restaurant, with great ambiance and some signature design choices that make it stand out. The space is bright, with some paintings and statues of Buddha and Kwan/Guan throughout the restaurant. Additionally, there's more than enough seating for about 120 people but it ends up getting packed around 7 or so so make sure your reservation is set in stone. We left here only to find at least 20-30 people waiting for tables.

The food is great but the service happens to be pretty weak here. The waitress  serving our party of 18 told us that tip wasn't included, after reading the menu and reviewing the bill that wasn't true at all. Needless to say, we weren't too impressed with what she tried to pull, so we were shuffled off to make room for more guests. It's a shame, she screwed herself out of a bigger tip by lying to us."}
{"text":"In the 5 years that I've been coming here, I've only tried 3 different dishes because I just love the green curry chicken so much! It comes with okra in the curry, which I've never seen at any other Hakka restaurant. I also find that my curry is loaded with vegetables and chicken, unlike other places that give you a few pieces of meat and veggies.

I usually come at lunch with my colleagues and the service is really quick- we are in and out within 1 hour or 1.5 hours at the most. Our lunch meals always begin with hot and sour soup, which is consistently delicious- I love adding the tiny little chili peppers for an extra kick. The meals also come with little veggie springrolls, which are crunchy and delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best Manchurian chicken in the GTA. I like to order it dry and extra spicy. The lunch prices are very fair and you get plenty of food. The staff is amazing they allow for changes and are always friendly. Shame this location is not in Toronto."}
{"text":"To be honest, I don't think I have anything really negative to say about this restaurant. We visited for lunch on a Sunday, and were the first people in the restaurant. As a party of seven, we were seated at an assembled table right by the bar near the front of the restaurant. During the day, the natural light from the windows makes for a pleasant meal.

From what I can recall, we ordered the Manchurian Chicken, Chili Chicken (dry), mixed vegetables, butter chicken, and chicken chow mein - looking back, yes that was a lot of chicken - and it was all rather delicious.

Our water glasses were always filled as soon as they got nowhere near empty. In my opinion, the service was great.

I'd definitely recommend visiting for a nice family meal."}
{"text":"I am surprised that I have been coming to this restaurant for lunch for over a year and haven't written a review. Geez!

I like Hakka food. Since my employer relocated to a different office building, this restaurant is the closest one. 

The food is good. My favourite is the spicy garlic chicken. I order it so often that the server knows what I am about to order! I also love the spicy chilli chicken. You can also order the majority of the lunch specials with beef or fish, too. 

The lemon chicken was disappointing. The batter on the chicken was soggy in the lemon sauce that it peeled off on its own. I haven't ordered that dish ever since. 

Of note, the chicken is battered and deep-fried. If you want chicken breast that isn't batterer and fried, it costs more. The fish is also fried, but you don't have any grilled option. If you are health-conscious, go for the beef. It's neither battered, nor deep-fried. 

There are also many vegetarian options. I have a vegetarian colleague who didn't have a problem finding a dish the last time she was here. 

The last time I was here, we waited a good thirty minutes for our food. It normally does not take that long. 

My heart still loves Chopstick Cuisine best. Royal Jasmine is good, but it has room to improve."}
{"text":"Hi,
I got to know about your restaurant by visiting your website http://www.royaljasmine.ca

Then I got a chance to try your lunch special which was really great in price as well as in quality."}
{"text":"If you like oily greasy upset stomach food then by all means come to this restaurant. The waitresses are pretty rude and customer service is not that great. Food is digustingly greasy and oily as you can see from pictures. 

Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good taste, good portions. Overall, really good Indian Chinese Hakka food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome Hakka food! Everything was yummy, service was fast even though it was packed and so busy.   One star off bc the Szechwan noodles were too oily and not as tasty.  Everything else was good."}
{"text":"I like this place better than all of the other Hakka-style restaurants that I have been to. The decor and ambiance is so much better than others. 

The menu selection is amazing. There is so much selection and the portions are just as great. I have ordered a few things off the menu each time was something different. I won't list everything I ordered but will say that the food is amazing. If you ask for spicy, it's spicy. It's fresh, it's tasty, and it leaves you more than satisfied. 

The service is also good here. Never had any complaints with any of the staff. They listen, they bring what you ask for, and they are courteous. It's a great family restaurant. 

Would definitely eat here again. Definitely worth a try if you haven't already been."}
{"text":"I really really love this place, The soup is to die for.. I'm not giving it 5 Stars because lately the food hasn't been the best, I believe they've changed the chef, but overall this place is good."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. It's reasonably priced, has a great ambience and good Hakka food. Recommended fare: Garlic chicken"}
{"text":"Absolutely AWFUL service! Never going back. Came sunday afternoon for lunch and the food is ABSOLUTELY NO COMPARISON to various food places. Too SALTY and absolutely not worth the 10 and 11 bucks they charge for the food. The servers barely come by the table ...had to call out and flag them multiple times. U want Hakka food...go anywhere else aside from here. Word of advice for management - DO something about your customer service and attentiveness to customers. Its awful!!"}
{"text":"The pakoras were good but the chicken dish was tooooooooooooo salty. do not go here"}
{"text":"Our first visit today:) went based on the reviews (coz that whatcha do nowadays:)
I think it was a good choice. I had tiger shrimp in lobster sauce, yuum..shrimp fried rice was really good also..
Anyways, I think it's a great place and I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Beware of takeout and left over food, they may NOT pack all that you have ordered. Please remember to check everything since their waiters cannot be trusted, and may end up keeping a dish or two aside while packing your food.

We went there and ordered 4 dishes. We barely ate from any of them and thought to get the remaining stuff (which was most of it) packed.

However when I came home, 1 dish was missing, my Schezuan Chicken. I called up the hotel and they just bluntly denied everything and said it was somehow my fault for not checking it???

Are you kidding me? First  you steal food from customers by not packing everything that is ordered, second you dont own up to your mistake, third you dont even offer the customer reparations and Last you Blame the customer for not checking and Trusting you??

Very Disappointing. Not going there again, they just lost a customer! This is NOT how you do business.

Word of Advice: Dont Trust their waiters for anything, if you take some food to go, dont trust that it will have what you ordered, Please Check it on the spot, because they will steal from you and then say we cant do anything about it :("}
{"text":"For the food alone I give this place 3/5.  The food is not terrible, but not great.  Some dishes are better than others.  However, I give this place -1 for the price, the service, and the atmosphere for a total of 2/5.

I went with a group of 5.  When you walk into the place is very well decorated and feels like a comfortable space.  However, whereas you might expect some traditional Indian or Chinese music, you are relegated to listening to Kenny-G-style elevator music of 90s hit songs.  Why do Chinese restaurants think this is pleasant? (A note: my wife didn't mind the music, but this is a pet-peeve of mine)

We sat down and looked over the menu.  We had a good laugh at the English fail that was the specials menu.  Seriously... \"till\" is not a word, you don't put an apostrophe in \"specials,\" and you don't capitalize \"hot\" in \"hot and sour soup.\"  Call me a language Nazi, but it's just sloppy and doesn't make me confident in your attention to detail.

We ordered their Family Special.  It was $60 for 1 large bowl of soup (to share), 10 spring rolls or chicken wings, 6 main dishes, and an ice cream and fried banana dessert (to share).  We were VERY disappointed that we could not mix-and match the 10 spring rolls or chicken wings.  All this says to me is that, \"we carry these in frozen packs of 10 and when we unfreeze one package we must use them all.\"  Seriously, the restaurant was literally empty apart from us - you can mix and match.

Here is what we ordered and how I rate each dish individually:

Tom Yum soup (4/5 - VERY tasty)
10 chicken wings (1/5 - dry, definitely not Indian or Chinese, and served on an odd array of lettuce)
Manchurian Chicken (3/5)
Chili Chicken (3/5)
Thai Chili Pakouras (4/5... my wife said 4.5/5)
Hakka Fried Rice w/ Shrimp (4/5)
Thai Green Curry (0/5 - absolutely disgusting)
Cantonese Noodles (3/5)

The final annoyance was that our glasses were constantly empty.  The waiter never once offered to fill our glasses without us having to ask.  I would understand if they were busy but the restaurant was EMPTY.

All in all the food was OK but it was definitely not worth the price and the service.  I've had better food at cheaper places."}
{"text":"There are actually quite a few Hakka restaurants in Mississauga, and this is one of the best.

ATMOSPHERE: Decor's a bit dated, but space is large. They can accommodate large groups. Good for families. I recommend going with 4 or more people, and share different mains! There's so much choice.

SERVICE: Okay. Though they may not check-in on you regularly, they usually respond fairly quickly to requests.

PRICE: Reasonable. Good portions. Especially the family-style combos/meals! Got a minimum party of 6? Get the Family Meal! You get a soup, an appetizer (try the wings), 4 mains (from a select menu), rice, and dessert. 

FOOD:  So tasty! It's true that a lot of Hakka food is spicy, but there are mild dishes (even some curries) and some completely non-spicy dishes that are SUPER tasty. Like, the chop suey chow mein (with fried egg - order \"Royal\" version), and the fish with lobster sauce.

They have the best Crispy Beef (unfortunately, not a part of the Family menu).

Pad Thai is good too.

And if you need to bring down the heat a bit, order a sweet mango lassi.


Highly recommended. :)"}
{"text":"Lunch is priced under $10. The tea is sweetened and the hot & sour soup was flavored well. The salad dressing is good 

If you want Thai-Chinese-Iranian, you might be ok.  If you like Indian you won't find a single authentic Indian dish.   Soup was not at all hot, barely warm . The table next to me sent theirs back as well. 

My coworker had the tandoori chicken. It was a very loose interpretation of the dish they said. I had spicy garlic beef which was mouth stinging hot and also too spicy to eat and tasted burnt. ( I love spicy when it's well flavored) The egg rolls they served with lunch were totally from a frozen box. 

 Two stars for the well flavored salad dressing,  the hot & sour soup and for the manager very reluctantly refunding just half of an entree that was totally in edible. 

But I refuse to pay for substandard food. 

Authentic Asian and Indian cuisine? Pfft. 

too picky? See my other reviews."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!! TERRIBLE!! TERRIBLE!

Here is what happened :
I called them to make a reservation for 9:30. The closing time of the restaurant is 10pm. See ATTACHED pic . The person on the phone advised me to come by 9:30 and not 10 as they take their last order then. 
We got there at 9:22pm.
They rushed us into ordering. Before we sat at our table, the waitress handed us menu cards and asked us to order. Imagine this- we had NOT even sat down at a table and they were rushing us to order.
Anyway, I ordered while standing and before sitting at the table, and the server told me that all the food, (soup, apps and entrees) will be served at the same time. Upon which I told them not to serve all at the same time. Reason being that while we eat the apps and the soup, the entrees will get cold sitting there. But they were so adamant in saying that that's how it is. And remember - I haven't even taken a seat yet and she's arguing with me that she will not be able to serve me hot food. It got to a point that I asked her if she wants us to leave. Then I asked her to call the manager
Then an Asian guy in a grey polo shirt came. Now I was hoping he would understand that all we want is hot food. Guess what he told me. He told me that \"my kitchen staff has to leave . So who will cook my food\"?. At 9:30 he is telling me that his staff will leave.... Unbelievable!!! 
After arguing with me, while all the tables were watching him, he said that after his cook prepares the food, he will microwave it for us. On which I said ok.
At least the food will be hot.
So then the food came out which tasted good. Can't complain . 
Then it was 10pm. And they started putting up chairs on the other tables and turned on an extremely loud vacuum. Basically wanted us to leave.
So we rushed and finished eating, asked for to-go containers. When I went to the bathroom at 10:15, they had turned the lights off. I had to ask them to turn the bathroom light on. 
I never could imagine that a restaurant could ever be so discourteous, rude, and inconsiderate. What a TERRIBLE bunch of people providing service there. It is a shame. And not to mention, they don't card credit card. How silly is that.
DO NOT GO THERE. They are not wort giving your business to. There are many other nicer restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My favourite hakka place ever! I go here every time I'm craving hakka food. 

My favourites and recommendations:
+ lollipop chicken!! (pictured)
+ tiger shrimp pakoras 
+ hot and sour soup
+ chilli chicken dry
+ Manchurian chicken 
+ garlic chicken

The serving sizes are quite large so order the dishes to share! 

The service is great and the employees are very friendly, welcoming, and willing to give recommendations on menu items. 

The space is very clean and well decorated. The place isn't usually crowded.

**I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try hakka food for the first time. You will not be disappointed!**"}
