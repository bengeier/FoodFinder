{"text":"We ordered the Fried Chicken, Harissa Meatballs, Roasted Carrots and Saffron Rice.  Everything was so ridiculously good.  The carrots surprised us the most.  How are they so flavourful?  The service was incredibly attentive.  Our water glasses were always full and we got lots of details on the food and check-ins while we were eating.  The ambiance is really nice, it's very pretty inside and the patterned plates on the table are very lovely.  We were told that they were from a vintage shop in Montreal that a friend of the chef owns.  Now that I'm back home I really wish I had gotten some fried chicken to go.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We went to Bar Sybanne last night for our weekly date night and we can't say enough wonderful things about the establishment. The atmosphere is cozy, the food is absolutely AMAZING (the best meat balls in the world according to my fianc√©) and the staff is beyond exceptional. We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"We love this place! I'm just about to make a reservation for the 3rd time, bringing friends there for the first time!  If you want to chew delicious food (highly accommodating with dietary needs), be surrounded by very passionate and friendly staff and chill out in a great atmosphere (that's not too crazy on the wallet), then this is your spot. Oh, and Marissa who runs the show is the best! The first time we went it was our anniversary and she brought us a card and champagne! Hello?!?! What resto in Toronto does that for you! Awesome Touch. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and service!  Do not miss the brussel leaves...  They are amazing!  James was our server for the evening and he was nothing but outstanding.. attentive, informative, and funny!  He helped us with recommendations on the menu, ensured we always had our drinks full, and was just overall friendly.  I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The spot is really cute and trendy. I liked the meatballs the best. And the lamb was yummy. My friends loved the beef tartare. I don't generally eat tartare but my friends  said it was the best they had. But the fried chicken was a miss.  Service was inattentive as food took an unusually long time to come out."}
{"text":"Food was simple and delicious. My husband and I had the hummus, Ottoman salad, meatballs, saffron rice, Brussel leaves, and fried chicken.  The Brussel leaves and fried chicken were so simple but so delicious. A simple twist to familiar foods. The Ottoman salad was bright, the saffron rice was flavourful. The meatballs were only average.  Everything was reasonably priced and the decor was beautiful. The service was also wonderful. Very down to earth and friendly. They also accommodated our baby in a stroller, which can be tough in some small downtown restaurants. The chef came out for a chat and I couldn't believe they had only opened 12 days ago! You'd never know it bc the food, service and everything was spot on."}
{"text":"Wow, what a find!  A menu with limited options but each one delicious and special.  We had sea bream that was grilled to perfection, and the saffron rice was divine and unusual.  Israeli salad was totally authentic (given our many trips to Israel, we appreciate that special taste).  The Turkish flat bread made a nice change from ordinary pita.  Staff was attentive, friendly, knowlegeable.  The place was clean and funky at the same time with mis-matched plates.  We spoke with the chef, a charming young man who has done his grandmothers proud in naming this bar/restaurant after them for having encouraged his cooking.  Well worth seeking this place out for a truly delicious dinner and a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Arrived here around 7:00pm Friday night without reservations. The restaurant was busy but luckily were seated right away. The restaurant was dimly lit and cozy. We were seated at a high table at the front of the restaurant. The food is Mediterranean tapas. My husband and I ordered 5 dishes to share. Eggplant dip with a homemade flatbread. The bread arrived to the table warm. It was delicious. From the hot menu we ordered the grilled mushrooms, saffron rice, harissa meatballs and lamb kofta. To round out our meal we ordered the ottoman salad. My husband loved the rice. My favourite dish was the harissa meatballs. Unfortunately it was the last item to arrive at our table and by then I was stuffed and could only eat one. I also had a glass of wine and my husband had their take on an old fashion. Our meal came just under $100. One thing I'd like to point out is how friendly our server was."}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed anything in a while but perhaps that's because nothing has been notable lately until now. I came here for a casual birthday dinner with some friends and we were all super impressed with the food, service and overall experience.  First off the staff had written a birthday card for me which was a really nice touch (ps: whoever writes the cards has amazing penmanship!). The service was warm, not overbearing and our glasses were never empty for long stretches of time. All of our drinks were amazing, really well crafted and beautifully presented.  Now let's talk food. Wow this is place nailed every dish we ordered (or we just ordered all the best things lol). This is one of those menus where nothing is overly complicated or fussy and the ingredients just speak for themselves. The timing was also really spot on; they brought out 2 plates per course and I think they even pair the dishes accordingly as the items seemed to really compliment one another. We ordered the crudo, eggplant dip, meatballs, grilled mushrooms, fried brussels sprouts, lamb kofta, fried chicken, halloumi and budino. I think our favourites were the fried Brussels, lamb and mushrooms, but not a single disappointment in the mix! They were even kind enough to comp. the halloumi cause the kitchen forgot to send it (was corrected very promptly though), and they made no issue with accommodating me and my friend's nut sensitivities by having the kitchen send the nuts on the side instead of on top of certain dishes.   The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food, service and ambience. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for somewhere cozy to try out around Ossignton."}
{"text":"Great decor and really friendly and knowledgeable staff. The food was amazing. It's tapas style and I went in a group of three. We shared the eggplant dip, lamb kofta, halloumi, ottoman salad, harissa meatballs and white fish crudo. I loved the eggplant dip and the ottoman salad - they were perfect. Everything was delicious and the unique flavors paired so well together. The service really outstanding. I would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for middle eastern/Mediterranean tapas style food."}
{"text":"Incredible food! Fun atmosphere! Sharing plates and great cocktails. We ate our way through the whole menu and were not disappointed once. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Amazing service, amazing food, amazing wine and atmosphere. Must try everything on the menu. Tip: Tuesdays half price wine bottles. Sundays half price food after 930"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night for drinks + bites and sat at the bar with a friend - it was perfect!  We had the mushrooms, halloumi, cauliflower and fried chicken and it was all delicious.  The food comes out as each dish is prepared which I always think is fun.  Will definitely be back for a date or girls night again!"}
{"text":"Came in for a cocktail at the bar with a couple of friends and ended up staying for several...and dessert too. Excellent service. Beautiful atmosphere. DAMN GOOD DRINKS. Oh and we were fighting over the last bites of the budino. So happy to have the oasis on Ossington!"}
{"text":"Likes: - Fried Brussel Leaves and Apple Cake - Must order these. - Very warm and attentive service  Dislikes: - I usually order hot water in place of tap water, which most restaurants offer for free, but Bar Sybanne does charge $1.00 for it.  - Didn't really enjoy the gozleme that came with the dips, a bit on the dry side. - Not a big fan of salmon crudo as other fish selections would have offered more flavour, but the dish was well executed.  Bar Sybanne is a relatively new addition on the Ossington strip.  This is our first Middle Eastern / Mediterranean food experience and we weren't disappointed, mostly because of the amazing Fried Brussel Sprouts. The cocktails here are pretty strong, so if you're a lightweight like me, one would be enough.  We ordered the following dishes:  - Eggplant Dip ($8) - The eggplant dip was served with gozleme, a Turkish flatbread dough. The gozleme was served nice and warm, but the texture is more on the dry and dense side. We were hoping for something more buttery and flaky. However, the eggplant dip was quite flavourful, and I really enjoyed the addition of the fragrant and sweet cipollini onions.   - Fish Crudo ($12) - I thought this dish was really well executed, as the flavours of the fish shined. The chef did a great job balancing all the ingredients, particularly the use of citrus where the acidity didn't overpower the dish. The good quality olive oil coating the thin salmon slices added a very nice smooth silky texture. This is the first time I've had salmon crudo, and I must say I prefer more flavourful types of fish, such as hamachi.  - Fried Chicken ($12) - This was a tasty dish, and I think the orange blossom honey should take full credit. The fried chicken itself was quite basic, served in small bite-size pieces with a nice crunch.   - MUST ORDER - Fried Brussel Leaves ($11) - This was a solid dish, although it didn't surprise us from all the positive reviews. My husband and I were not only impressed with the flavours, but also the chef's ability to make the brussel leaves so thin, crispy, yet not overly oily. The dates sauce was a perfect compliment to the dish, and we were on cloud nine with every bite. We had something similar in Maui, but I must say, Bar Sybanne does it better. We would return to the restaurant again just to have this.    - MUST ORDER - Apple Cake ($10) - I'm a sucker for desserts, especially those made in house, and this one did not disappoint. The cake was fried, which was obviously delicious, but the addition of the tart and refreshing Granny Smith apple cubes and pomegranate reduced the heaviness of the fried cake. The Morroccan spiced ice cream was quite unique, and it paired really well with the cake.   Overall, Bar Sybanne lived up to the hype, and we definitely plan on returning at some point to try out their other menu items."}
{"text":"We recently had dinner at cosy Bar Sybanne and it was a nice experience overall. Cocktails were quite good and so was the food.    The only reason I'm giving this review four stars is due to the fact that the hummus was not a home run for me; it was too chunky for my liking and good hummus to me is the holy grail dish in any middle eastern/Lebanese cuisine.   The fried chicken, tartare, halloumi and lebneh spread were all excellent. I would come back again. Reservations highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a neat restaurant with such a warm and inviting atmosphere. We walked in without any reservations, actually we accidentally stumbled upon it as we were going to check out another restaurant.  We started off by looking for a nice bottle of wine and our server immediately sent over a sommelier to help us with our selection. She was amazing- friendly, knowledgeable and so personable (Her name is Marissa). Probably the best customer service I have received in a very long time from the restaurant industry.   Love the decor, staff and most importantly the food. Every dish we had was full of flavour and meticulous thought.    We had the Eggplant dip, Brussels leaves, fried chicken and Za'atar Tartare. Highly recommend these dishes.   Highly recommend this spot and can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This is a recently opened and interesting restaurant that is well worth a visit. Decor is sparse and well matched and there is a large bar. Service is solicitous and well-informed. Wine list has some unusual elements in it and is reasonably priced. Food overall is adventurous, well-prepared and presented.  Specifically:- Marcona almonds were sweet with cinnamon. Labneh had a very fresh taste to it. The humus was very good. The Israeli salad is finely chopped tomatoes onions etc with a sharp dressing. The Brussels leaves are crispy and unusual. I'm not the Tartare sort, but this one was mild and tender. The grilled fish was excellent, note: they prefer that you debone it yourself. The fried chicken  was a small portion but it was tasty indeed.  Overall a great and recommended experience."}
{"text":"Bar Sybanne is located on the edge of Ossington strip (very close to Dundas) and our visit was a pleasant one and a nice surprise.  There were three of us, and together we had a fennel salad with orange and pomegranate (unique and refreshing), a picketed veggie dish (carrots and beet juice infused cauliflowers), a grilled whole fish (really liked the sauce on the side), a halloumi dish, and a fried Brussel sprouts with almond slices (sooo good!). every dish is crafted and presented elegantly. It's unique, delicious and impressive. The highlights are definitely the Brussels sprouts and the whole fish. I think this might have been the best modern middle eastern restaurants in Toronto.   Will come back!"}
{"text":"Bar Sybanne: non pretentious, non fussy and super delicious.   The brussel leaf dish is haunting my dreams as one of the tastiest brussel sprout dish I've ever had. Deep fried and sweetened with date sauce, it's everything you've wished for, the sweet and salty is dancing with the deep flavours of the brussel leaves. GO eat it now!   Also: the whole fish is a beaut to look at AND so so delicious, our waitress deboned the fish for us and we just dig in. So don't worry about the bones you guys."}
{"text":"Bar Sybanne serves Mediterranean inspired food. The decor is cosy and has a Middle Eastern vibe. The service is attentive and friendly.   The food is flavourful. The food is designed to be shared. It is best to go with a few people so that you can sample the different dishes. We ordered the flatbread with labneh, fried brussel leaves, saffron rice, daily fish, fried chicken, harissa meatballs, lamb kafta, Israeli salad, seasonal fruit and chocolate budino.   The standouts were the fried brussel leaves, fried chicken, and saffron rice. The fried brussel leaves were done excellently. The leaves were crunchy - salty little flakes mixed with crunchy almond shards on top of date sauce that brings the whole dish together.   The fried chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The savoury taste of the chicken is a nice contrast to the honey that is drizzled on top of the dish.   The saffron rice is fragrant - mixed with dried apricot, sultanas and pistachios.    I would highly recommend Bar Sybanne. It is a worth the trip to Ossington."}
{"text":"Bar Sybanne lived up to the hype!!! I went last night and we were overwhelmed by the menu choices (this means a lot coming from me as I am a picky eater).  The menu is sharing style and they recommend 2-3 dishes per person.  We ordered 6 between the two of us and were very very full.  I appreciated that the tapas portions were quite generous (vs. for other tapas/sharing restaurants I find the portions are tiny such that you merely get a taste of each dish and need to keep ordering to stay full).    We started with the eggplant dip that comes with a flat bread sprinkled with sesame seeds and zaatar. The dip was interesting and chunky and did not taste like a traditional baba ganoush.  Once we finished the bread, and still had half the plate of dip left over, our waitress offered to bring us more bread but we opted for cucumber slices to avoid filling up too fast.  We also shared the ottoman salad, grilled mushrooms, brussel sprouts, fried chicken and the saffron rice.  I was also happy that the dishes came out in waves (although at the end we did have three on our table).  I would definitely come back to try more dishes.  We had a tough time narrowing down our order to the six we chose.  The service was very attentive without being annoying.  Our waitress helped us finalize our menu choices.  It had come up in conversation that we got engaged a few months ago and at the end they brought us each a glass of sparkling wine which was such a nice and thoughtful touch."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is excellent and the service is great too. Get the brussel sprouts... I dream about them for days after each visit."}
{"text":"The best food I've had in a while. Such a wonderful experience, and every different plate that came to the table was better than the last. I couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here at Bar Sybanne with the chance to try some really outstanding Middle Eastern/Mediterranean/Persian inspired menu. The place is bustling in the evening so make reservations when you can.  We came out to Bar Sybanne to celebrate a birthday and I had made the reservation through OpenTable. I had casually mentioned that it was for a birthday celebration and the staff presented her with a nice little birthday card. I was very impressed by the thoughtful gesture by the restaurant staff as a whole.  The service and staff at Bar Sybanne were really courteous, friendly, and attentive to our needs. They helped pace our meal adequately so that we didn't run out of room on our little table for 2.  This restaurant is family-style so come with people you like to share food and conversation with. The interior has a nice modern and comforting feel set aglow from the romantic mood lighting.  For our appetite that night, we decided on the following:  1. Labneh: I liked the addition of the pomegranate nibs and the nice smooth texture of the soft cream cheese. The sweetness of the molasses didn't really come through for me. They give you some really nice crunchy carbs to spread it over.  2. Ottoman Salad: Something light and crunchy to whet the appetite. The tahini dressing was light with the acidity of the citrus.  The sprinkling of chopped up dried apricots and the apple gave it a great touch of sweetness to balance out the tahini dressing.  3. Steak Tartare: I can never say no to a tartare. It's like something I always want to try when I see it on the menu. Every restaurant has their own twist and take on this classic dish. It's always fun to see them bend the dish to their creative will. This one was very tasty and with a generous portion sizing. It's spiced with harissa and feta along with lemon, egg yolk, and EVOO. The meat was finely chopped up but not overdone like it was ground beef. Harissa gave each bite a little burst of heat.  4. Fried Chicken: little tender crispy morsels of chicken tossed with honey and  a ripe citrus sauce. It was really fragrant and the meat was super juicy.   5. Saffron Rice: we paired the tender crispy chicken with this super large heaping of saffron rice. I've never really had saffron before so this was a  first time experience for me. I really liked the chopped up dried apricots, sultanas, and pistachios that lifted the rice dish with additional textures and flavours. It was a good dish to compliment the chicken bites and will fill out any outstanding space in your tummy thereafter.  6. Apple Cake: no birthday celebration is complete without dessert. This came with a little candle on top and a card from the Bar Sybanne staff. Colour me impressed. The dessert was a nice cap-off to the night. It wasn't overly sweet and the Moroccan spiced ice cream was great.  Overall, a great experience here at Bar Sybanne for all occasions."}
{"text":"We tried Bar Sybanne based on such glowing reviews, but after eating there we could not understand why it has received such positive reviews. The portion size for dishes is tiny, especially relative to the high prices being charged. You will therefore either leave hungry, or spend a fortune not to leave hungry. The food was good, but not great and we tried a majority of the items on the menu.  If you make a reservation and have to cancel last minute, your credit card will be charged so we walked in rather than taking a chance by making a reservation."}
{"text":"Alright so I'm giving this place 0 stars for customer service, and 3 stars for food (meh) so I feel like these 2 stars are me being generous.  TL; DR: bad customer service (read: don't care about the safety of their customers), food is mediocre.  Ok so to start off with the customer service. We made a reservation here for a birthday dinner a few weeks in advance and were told that if we were to cancel we would be charged $50 per person. The reservation was for April 14 so we thought weather wouldn't be an issue. Well lo and behold the ice storm came through that morning! We were stressing out because we did not want to be charged $50 per person. Two of the seven guests had to cancel because they were coming from Oakville, and the restaurant seemed ok with that. The police were saying not to go outside and it looked insane out there, not to mention I am 9 months pregnant so I wanted to cancel the entire reservation. We called and tried to cancel (after updating them that 2 people would be missing) and they informed us that we would be charged $20 per person because they wouldn't be able to re-reserve the table at that point (an hour before the reservation). I understand that under normal circumstances but it was incredibly dangerous to be outside! Not to mention the fact that it would be more likely that they wouldn't be able to re-reserve the table because of the ice storm and not because of the timing. We reluctantly went to the restaurant because of this but I was incredibly upset that they seemed to care more about their bottom line than about the safety of their patrons.   Customer service when we got to the restaurant wasn't much better. The server did not ask me if I wanted a drink, after asking everyone else personally (yes I am pregnant but they have mocktails), and when I asked if the eggplant dip was smoked, she turned and responded to my husband who was sitting across the table from me (???) and she said \"it's sweetened with maple syrup\" and she informed us that if we didn't like it she would replace it with humus. Well it came and it was smoked or at least charred giving it a smokey flavour. I did not eat it but other people at the table did. This behaviour was all just really odd to me.  On to the other food - it was alright but I would not go back for the food. The best thing was the fried brussel leaves - these were surprisingly tasty and something that I haven't had at any other restaurant. Nothing else was very \"special\". I love halloumi and theirs was fine, hummus was ok, labneh was fine, mushrooms I wasn't super into despite the recommendation from the server that we get two orders. The people I was with really enjoyed the chicken.   Since we were celebrating two birthdays they provided two desserts - the bundino and the apple cake. The bundino was amazing and something I would definitely eat again. The apple cake was good but didn't really go with the ice cream flavour.  Clearly I was in a bad mood during this meal because of how I felt they did not care about our safety. Furthermore - it seemed like they were still getting a lot of foot traffic, so I don't even think that they would have been losing money by us not being there! I'm sure they could have filled the table from people who were still walking around the ossington area despite the crazy weather and recommendations to stay inside. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've visited Bar Sybanne several times and cannot give enough praise to the restaurant, its staff, the decor, and most importantly, the food.  My first time was in October 17' when I walked into the restaurant on a full Saturday evening, and asked the hostess (who I now know as Marissa, the General Manager) for the wait time for a large group. I was travelling with 5 other people and despite being a larger group with no reservation, Marissa told us they'd be able to fit us in for a later time. That certainly worked for the group and we came back around 9pm, with our party 1 person larger than expected. That wasn't an issue and the restaurant quickly accommodated. From that time we walked in and over the course of our 2.5h dinner we had exceptional service, great wine and fantastic food (more on that below).    I came back to Bar Sybanne a few months later with my fianc√©e and Marissa remembered us without skipping a beat. This second trip lived up to our expectations from our initial visit months back, and we haven't looked back since. I can honestly say this is my favourite restaurant in Toronto; I've taken a hiatus from Yelp, but had to revisit to write this review.   Now, here's a brief summary on the details you really want to know:  Decor and Atmosphere: Beautiful design with appropriately dim lighting, and music loud enough to hear but not drown out your conversation. Service: Read above - 15/10 Food: The menu is catered to sharing, and for 2 people we usually order about 5 dishes, 6 if we're hungry. The food comes out as its ready so its fresh. I've tried almost every item on the menu and they are all exceptional, but favourites include the lamb kofta, labneh, Israeli salad, mushrooms and fried brussel sprout leaves.   When you're craving Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food, make sure Bar Sybanne is your next stop."}
{"text":"We had an incredible experince here! The food was so delicious and unique. The flavours are so pronounced and creative, it's an incredible experience for your taste buds! We really loved the halloumi, brussel leaves, beet dip, and fried chicken. The flavours are unlike anything we've had before and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tasty food. The menu is quite small but according to Gordon Ramsay, that's a good thing. As mentioned in other reviews, the brussel sprouts are unbelievably good and are a must-order. I also enjoyed the beef tartare and grilled fish.  I thought the roasted cauliflower, pickled vegetables, and lamb kofta were fine.  I don't know if this was just a one-off thing but the restaurant was uncomfortably hot and humid when I went - hopefully they fix this."}
{"text":"Every review speaks to how great the food is at Bar Sybanne. Recently opened, we weren't able to get a reservation for a Friday night at 7, but the waitress was nice enough to tell us to come by around that time and something might open up. Sure enough, our group of 3 was lucky enough to get a cozy table where we spent almost 5 hours catching up like good friends do.  The menu is meant for sharing and the waitress was so patient with us. I started with the Basilica to drink - basil and egg white speak to me and this didn't disappoint. A hint of tartness, sourness, and the herbacious basil made it an instant winner.  For sharables, we decided on the following: 1. Eggplant spread with maple 2. Beet dip with yogurt and spice Both came with housemade flatbread. While I love beet, I felt that the beet flavour could have come through more in this dip. Still very unique and enjoyable. The eggplant was delicious; it tasted fresh with very prominent pieces of eggplant with every bite. The flatbread was not oily and dense enough to hold the drip with every scoop.  For Hot shares, we had the  3. Fried Brussel Sprouts 4. Grilled Mushrooms 5. The Daily Fish Both of these were delicious. The shredded brussels were fried with dates and almonds and it had different flavour profiles with each bite. I couldn't get enough of it! The grilled mushrooms were slices of king-oyster type steaks and I wish there were most slices because they were juicy with an aioli that kept you wanting more. The Daily Fish was a huge portion for 3 and it reminded me of how fish is prepared in a Chinese restaurant, bone in. Good thing one of us knew how to debone it! We were getting very full at this point but managed to eat most of it! I would definitely recommend this dish  - it was totally worth it. Cooked properly, not overdone, and very fresh. The dish I could have done without is the Ottoman Salad with Tahini Dressing. It tasted like coleslaw with creamy asian sesame dressing. I found it to be overly heavy, and nothing special.  After a lovely meal, we couldn't leave without trying their dessert. We ordered a couple orders of apple spice cake with moroccan spice ice cream. The essence of Morocco really comes through with the cardamom flavours. The cake was super moist and was complemented with bits of apple and decadent and creamy ice cream. The more I write, the more I want to go back! I would have to say this was one of the best meals of the year. Nice addition to the Ossington strip!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday.  It appears that people were being turned away if they didn't have reservations -- I think they were pretty full for dinner that day.  We tried the following: - Hummus - Gozleme - Eggplant Dip - Israeli Salad - Fried Chicken - Harissa Meatballs - Fried Brussel Leaves  All of them were great, especially the fried brussel leaves... never had a dish quite like it and it was super delicious.  Since we told the wait staff that we were here for a birthday, a waitress came back out with an Apple Cake -- the ice cream was especially interesting since it had a variety of spices to it, which nicely complemented the cake.  While we were eating the apple cake, one of the cooks from kitchen also came out with a Chocolate Budino that had a candle in it.  It was extremely kind of them to give us two desserts for the night!!  Overall, great atmosphere -- the decor inside is very nice and the staff members were very attentive.  Definitely coming back... I'll keep dreaming about the brussel leaves until then..."}
{"text":"A recommendation by a friend and boy was it a good recommendation. We got in Sunday evening and got seated right away. It was a quiet but casual atmosphere which felt really comfortable and you can definitely converse with friends at ease. Our server offered excellent recommendations and we took her up on a few offers. There were 4 of us in total and we were quite full from the 8 dishes we had. The portion was fair and so was the price. The brussel sprouts are a must try and I'd recommend the saffron rice as well. I think this is a nice and cozy place for an intimate gathering."}
{"text":"Last week I returned here for the second time in 6 months which may not sound very often but if you are into trying new restaurants and you live in Toronto you'll know that's actually amazing. I loved the food. My favourites are the brussel sprouts and the whole grilled fish. The only thing that I never ate before I tried them here are brussel sprouts. I hated them and still do. This is the only place I will ever eat and enjoy them. All the leaves are separated and flaked. They tasty nutty and melt in your mouth. The fish and fish sauce is absolutely amazing. From the dips I really like the labneh and the hummus. But the hummus does not taste any different than any other good hummus. It's just a great hummus. I like the beat dip too. I'm not a fan of the eggplant dip, their twist is that it is sweet and I didn't really enjoy it. I do think the  baba ganoush (middle easteren) or the  melitzanosalata (Greek) version of it are just better, though I don't think they were trying to do a spin on it but were maybe inspired by finding a 4th dip and by the eggplant flavour of this famous dip. The other thing I wasn't very pleased about is the halloumi cheese which again was their spin on the Greek Sakanaki because it was too hard, it should definitely be softer but the apricot jam they serve it with is delicious! If it's home made, they should start packaging and selling it in the restaurant. I would totally buy that as a filling for crepes."}
{"text":"Needless to say, I was blown away.   Bar Sybanne has been on my 'to-try' list for the longest time. I have finally gotten around trying this place out last weekend. The verdict is that this restaurant is now on my list of favourites in Downtown Toronto!   Lots of great photos have surfaced when I was searching up this restaurant. A lot of reviews compared this with other great Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurants like Byblos. I had quite an expectation going in especially after having read so many 5-star reviews.  The restaurant itself is quite small. Seats are limited, and reservations are not easy.  Make sure to book at least a week in advance. We got seated by the window at one of their high top tables. It was not exactly the most spacious, but the coziness of the place does give you that feeling of  eating at a local restaurant in the crowded medina of Fez. It brought back good memories from Morocco and Turkey.   The menu was quite small - perfect for those with selection-phobia. We decided to go with more than what we would usually order. We got the eggplant dip, Halloumi cheese, Brussel sprouts, grilled mushrooms, saffron rice, and the grilled fish along with 6 drinks. Needless to say, we devoured everything on the table.   For appetizers:   The eggplant with the flat bread was a great starter for the table. The eggplant was seasoned well and the flatbread was warm and fresh. The halloumi cheese was grilled just right that the bite was just perfect, not too tender and stringy. It was served with a sweet homemade marmalade . The mushrooms were seasoned perfectly - sweet and savoury with a touch of tanginess. The brussel sprouts also exceeded our expectations.   For mains (which stole the spotlight of the night)  The saffron rice was out of the world.  I don't usually eat rice or that much carbs to begin with, but I am pretty sure I cleared at least 1/3 of that dish by myself. The rice was cooked perfectly.  The aroma of the dish filled the room as it was served.  The saffron spice was so fragrant that you can smell it from a mile away.  Every grain was infused with such rich saffron flavour. It was topped with fresh pomegranate, pistachio, apricots and raisins.  It didn't only taste delicious, but it also looked beautiful.   Next was the grilled fish. It was grilled perfectly, presented and plated nicely, and tasted absolutely amazing. I love fish, and this dish did not disappoint.   I am looking to making another reservation with them soon to try the rest of the menu. This place is definitely up there with one of the best restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Our St. Paddy's day food/booze crawl came to an absolutely mindblowing conclusion thanks to our stop at Bar Sybanne. Somehow this joint wasn't even on my radar, but after an attempt to stop in at neighbor Salt was thwarted (we were seated but ignored), we decided to give Bar Sybanne a shot.  I'm so happy we did.  We somehow managed to snag a sweet table by the front and we began perusing their simple yet promising menu. We ordered:  Hummus (\"Tahina + Sumac + Za'atar\"): This smooth and creamy variation of the venerable Middle Eastern dish is definitely unlike most versions you've ever had. It's quite delicious, although I did feel that the chef did apply the lemon with a rather heavy hand (i.e. it's almost overwhelmingly citrus-y).  Harissa Meatballs (\"Dry Aged Beef + Harissa + Tomato\"): Oh my goodness. I think I can safely say, without hyperbole, that this was one of the greatest meatball dishes I've ever eaten. Everything here worked: the perfectly-cooked meatballs were accompanied by a seriously tasty and downright addictive tomato sauce. I'd be happy eating this every day for the rest of my life.  Fried Brussel Leaves (\"Date + Almond\"): As others have noted, this is an incredible unique and thoroughly delish dish. I have no idea how they did it, but they've completely reinvented the brussel sprout, essentially. It's a crunchy, tasty treat, although I will say that it's a little dry. It came last, so we had nothing else to eat it with and the dish suffered because of that.  I also want to single out the amazing service. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, and when the bill came, my dining companion and I were having a friendly little battle over who would pay and I was holding the bill away from her. The waitress came with the credit-card machine and playfully said she wouldn't let my dining companion see the amount. It was pretty great.  And then, just as we were walking out the door, a different individual poked her head out and thanked us for coming. I mean, how awesome is that?"}
{"text":"Best cocktails, attractive staff, delicious (and plentifully vegetarian) bites! Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and the food was very tasty. What I was most impressed was the portion sizes and the pricing was really appropriate. Tapas can easily get overpriced and you leave hungry. I was stuffed and satisfied and didn't break the bank! Definitely a go again place."}
{"text":"Ossington Ave's best kept secret. From sublime cocktails crafted by one of Toronto's best bartenders (I could share her name but then someone would have to kill me) to wonderfully authentic food by one of the most gifted chefs, Bar Sybanne is a beautiful treat for all your senses. An exquisitely crafted wine list accompanies elegantly-presented dishes (ooh - my Lamb Kofta!!) that delight every part of your palate. And, to top it off, friendly yet professional service that sets a new benchmark for restaurants in Toronto. Bar Sybanne is now my weekly addiction and I couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Bar Sybanne on a Wednesday night between Christmas and new Years.   Food: Excellent! We shared hummus, fried chicken, lamb kofta, and brussel sprouts. Although friend chicken seems odd for a Mediterranean place, it was good, as was the rest of the order!   Drinks: I had a French cocktail with gin and my friend ordered a glass of wine that was recommended by our server. Both good and standard pricing for a place on ossington.   Vibe: Vibe is great! It's dark and a bit loud. We went here right before heading out to a club and it was the perfect atmosphere to get our night started.   Service: Service was great as well. Our servers were very helpful in recommendations and our food came out at a good pace.  I would definitely return and recommend Bar Sybanne!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere! Came here for dinner on a weekday between Christmas and New Years and it was packed. The restaurant is cozy and great for a girls night out or date night. The food is tapas style and great for sharing. My friend and I ordered a few dishes to share: beet dip, fish crudo, halloumi, fried chicken, saffron rice, and the seasonal fruit. Our favourites were the beet dip and fried chicken. The beet dip was made with yogurt and spice and served with housemade Turkish flatbread. The flatbread arrived warm and we ordered additional flatbread just to scoop up the remaining beet dip. The fried chicken was juicy and flavourful, the orange blossom honey drizzled on top was amazing (I wish they sell the honey so I can bring it home).   We also tried two cocktails - Satie and Co. and English Basilica. Both were well crafted and tasted amazing.   Overall, the service was good and we had a great time. Will consider coming back in the future to try other dishes and cocktails."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here recently as we both love Mediterranean cuisine and were craving Moroccan. We really enjoyed the service and the environment. The drinks we ordered were flavourful and balanced, and reflected the food menu and theme of the restaurant as a whole. The food menu offered Moroccan inspired fare that features many traditional flavours. I was originally a bit disappointed to miss out on spiced olives and tajine, but it what we ordered was fantastic and we enjoyed very much! Recommend the brussel sprouts and the fried chicken."}
{"text":"We started off with the Dip Sampler, which immediately won everyone over (Hummus, Labneh and Eggplant - plus points if you combine the Labneh and Eggplant!) and then moved on to the Mushrooms and Halloumi, which was a light and tasty precursor to our main event: Spicy Harissa Meatballs, Lamb Kofta, Fried Brussel Leaves and Saffron rice. Each dish playfully complements the other - from the savory Lamb and Spicy Meatballs to the aromatic and exquisite Saffron rice and Brussel Leaves. This full flavored spread was paired with a refreshing and light cocktail, the English Basilica (for the gin lovers out there!).   Our server, Eva, was attentive and incredibly helpful in walking us through the menu and sharing recommendations. Overall, an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"When a tummy starts to have a growl for Mediterranean, my Toronto restaurant list was pretty limited but my yelp search showed up the new Bar Sybanne.  With it's many fresh 5 stars, this seems to be very promising and I would say that my Saturday dinner here didnt disappoint.  The atmosphere here is modern and clean with a touch of warmth & intimacy.  Though they have a nice bar area with a few seatings and a good drink list, I would say that this Mediterranean tapas is more upscale than a simple bar.  As the evening progressed, it got fairly dark but the candlelight on each table and dimmed lightning created a nice ambiance.  Service here was friendly and welcoming.  The hostess was pretty hilarious as she asked each table for the gossip on why the group was dining out that night.    The menu is simple but flavours are richly complex than what it reads.  We were told that it was good to aim for 3 to 5 dishes depending on where we chose on the menu.  We decided on a few dips, vegetables, and 2 meat mains.  We were told that it should be enough for us and though I would say I wasn't starved leaving... it is a bit on the lighter side.  Hummus dip - Lovely smooth with a nice helping of sumac and za'atar spices to keep it interesting.  The freshly grilled flat bread was the perfect way to eat it up... I will admit that we ran out of bread far faster than eating all the dip.  4/5  Eggplant dip - OH WOW... ok, this was very surprisingly good.  The addition of the caramelized cippolini onions and maple syrup took this from creamy and simple to savoury sweet flavour bomb.  I loved this.  We only got one small flat bread per dip and like the hummus, we ran out of bread ... key tip, use the crispy chicken to dip this into!  5/5  Brussels Sprouts - A simple vegetable dish... not at all.  Put all your preconceptions about this vegetable cause what Bar Sybanne does with it is very good.  Shredded and then fried crispy and laced with crunchy nuts and tossed in a rich sweet date sauce.  Another vegetable winner where the tastes would satisfy even the hungriest carnivore 5/5  Daily Fish ... Sea Bass - This was grilled nicely... soft tender white flesh with a bit of romesco sauce and lemon to enhance.  I will tell everyone that if you don't know how to debone yourself... this might be a challenge to eat.  Thank goodness I knew how to not completely butcher it so we can enjoy it.  4/5  Fried Chicken - Someone did mention that this was a very small portion size and I can understand their concern.  It is on the smaller size (and we were told the meatballs was even smaller for the same price point).  I would say treat this more like a tasty snack instead of a main.  This execution is pretty good... crispy thin shell that yields nicely to tender pieces of chicken.  It isn't my favourite fried chicken (Kaarage takes that vote) but it is a good rendition.  Careful with some of the larger pieces.  We learned they were just big cause they had really big fatty pieces of chicken skin instead of meat.  Those pieces were just a tad oilier than others 4/5  Overall, this is a great addition to Ossington hot dining scene.  Food is solid with several shining dishes.  Value wise, it's fair with some dishes being better than others (Fish is a great dish if you can debone it yourself).  And another great point to bring me back is the service... its a great balance of being welcoming and informed while still offering an upscale experience."}
{"text":"Fresh on my radar with consistently high praise, I knew I had to make reservations to venture out to Ossington and visit Bar Sybanne. Despite being relatively simple in decor, Bar Sybanne feels intimate and at the same time, slightly transposed with its basketweave light fixtures, Moroccan-inspired latticework panels throughout, European bone china flatware, high top tables at the front---understated and tasteful. Staff were very warm, knowledgeable, and thorough. Food arrived at a measured pace, never leaving too much pause in between. My girlfriend and I shared the house pickles, the crudo, the halloumi, the fried chicken, the Brussels leaves, a basilica and a coupe de grace.  The house pickles were turnips that day, and were forwardly tart and served to engage our appetites. We then delved into the crudo which was steelhead trout for the day; very fresh, simple and paired very nicely with the slivers of pickled turnips. The halloumi was one of my favourites this meal---salty, blistered with crispy caramelization, with an interior texture pleasantly resembling half squeaky half melted poutine curds, and supported by the mildly tart and sweet marmalade and oregano, it was a dish that vanished quite suddenly. The fried chicken was good but paled compared to the other brighter and exciting dishes---tender, delicious batter. By far, however, the greatest surprise was the Brussels leaves. A wonderful play of textures with a gentle crisp of leaves, a nutty crunch from the almonds, and just an earthy and addicting fragrance, this dish was our favourite. Both drinks were very smooth and delicious, pairing very nicely with our dinner. The basilica, in particular, is dangerously smooth and would be my top choice on my next visit.  My only regret is that I didn't arrive with as empty a stomach as I had wished, and hope to return for the dips and the baked whole fish, as well as to sample the other handcrafted cocktails. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful service. We had a great time. Recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambience and wonderful service!    Came here on a Friday night and snagged a cosy table for 2 at the back of the restaurant.  Our server was warm, friendly and knowledgeable.  Tapas-style Middle Eastern menu.  I highly recommend the beet starter, fried chicken and Brussels sprouts.  Drinks are tasty, but pricey.  Really enjoyed the whole experience and look forward to coming back to this great spot on Ossington!"}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken, thought it was very good. Good spice and flavour. Also had the hummus, eggplant w pita and they were both very flavour intense as well. Was stoked that they carried my fave cider as well, couldn't help myself, might have had a 2nd glass"}
{"text":"We were here recently for dinner with another couple. The room is well-done and the vibe late night was verging on bar/lounge rather than restaurant, which was fun. Hummus and Labneh came with tasty flatbread. The Israeli and Ottoman salads were fresh, but a little bland. The halloumi was tasty, and came with bitter orange peel marmalade which was unusual. Fried chicken was essentially popcorn chicken. I did enjoy the apple cake for dessert, which was baked perfectly crisp on the outside and came with spiced ice cream. Many of the dishes are a little one note, there's a lot of za'atar going on here.  Service was very friendly. But, this place is super expensive. For two of us, three drinks total, the tab came to $168.  I second other reviewers, the fried brussels leaves are excellent. But they were really the only outstanding dish we had. At this price, you can do better; this is not one of the best restaurants in the city, but it's priced like it."}
{"text":"Great use of Middle Eastern and north African spices. The chef knows how to use the spices; layers of flavor are delicious. Very reasonably priced for this level of cuisine. Seek it out as a destination before everyone in Toronto knows about it.."}
{"text":"The food here was really good, and the middle eastern dishes were pretty authentic. I am half Lebanese and grew up eating most of these foods. I was pleasantly surprised when we found this place. The fried chicken is a MUST! Not exactly a middle eastern staple, but still a must. :)"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY??!  The fried chicken, the eggplant dip, the saffron rice, the steak tartare, the fish of the day and the apple cake!  The fried chicken was crunchy with some sweetness, perhaps from honey but it was interesting. Comes in bite sizes but I have to warn you, the portion sizes run on the small side because this restaurant is tapas style so you might want to order another order if your party size is big.   The eggplant dip is also delish. Served with gozleme which is a Turkish flatbread. Additional gozlemes cost $3 so don't think it's bread and it's free for all!   The steak tartare was amazing too. Served with crunchy gozleme, the steak tartare tasted fresh and very flavourful. Lots of good ingredients mixed in there I bet in order to really draw out the flavors of the steak bits!   The fish of the day is different every time. We were served a seabream with textures similar to a sea bass. Very simple grilled fish, but it's nicely complemented with Romesco sauce, salt and lemon on the side. Romesco sauce has a tomato base which is very flavourful.   The saffron rice was very pretty with color and different ingredients. Definitely had a lot of saffron in the dish. The only feedback is the rice was a bit over cooked and there were clumps of rice in the dish.   For dessert, we got all three! I personally liked the apple cake the most because it's the most unique dessert at the restaurant. It also is their most popular one too! It's a Moroccan spiced cake with spiced ice cream on top. The cake was spicy! Now isn't that different? It's interesting, you should try it to see if you like it!   All plates are meant to be shared because of the tapas nature of the dishes. The plates are unique too with lots of different designs. Decor of the restaurant is cute and cozy. If you're wondering, the name Sybanne actually comes from combining the chef's two grandmother names together - Sybal and Anne hence Sybanne. You can also find their portraits on the wall. They were the inspirations for the chefs dishes.  LAST TIP?!  Make reservations because this restaurant isn't too big and it gets really busy around dinner time! They've only been open for three months so it's still a relatively new restaurant in the Ossington strip! The best seat in the house is definitely at the back with the coaches and cushions. Your party has to be five people though! There's two such seatings in the back so when you make your reservations, you can request for those seats!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome experience!!!! From the service to the food. Hands down such a great experience. We especially loved the Brussel Sprouts, Israeli salad, Eggplant dip. Like the list could go on. We were greeted by the manager who was nothing short of wonderful. She remembered my sister and the wine that her and her friends had ordered 4 months previous.   It's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"You need to order the FRIED BRUSSEL LEAVES. I've never had such amazing Brussels sprouts in my LIFE.   Now that's out of the way, we were 2 people and ordered 4 dishes. I informed the server of my lactose intolerance and he mentioned that the menu is very dietary restriction friendly.   He recommended eggplant dip served with cucumbers instead of the bread (which had dairy), which was a great alternative! The dip itself was okay, I expected something closer to baba ghanoush, and was pleasantly surprised that it was more like pure eggplant.   We also ordered fried chicken with honey (the size was similar to popcorn chicken, it was great) and the saffron rice (which was also great). The bill wasn't expensive either! I will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu but in the interim attempt to recreate the Brussels sprouts because I can't live without it now."}
{"text":"We got the fish, Brussels sprout, and the rice.  The fish was definitely a good value at 25$ for the whole fish. My favourite dish were the Brussel sprouts. Crispy, flavourful, delicious. The date pur√©e made it a little sweet balancing out the bitterness of the Brussel sprouts. The almonds added a nice crunch to it too.  The saffron rice was not exactly to our liking. There was apricot, raisins, pistachios, and pomegranate. The dish was very pretty but were not used to the spices in it.   Their dishes are great for sharing. For tapas, I'm surprised that their portions are quite large than other tapas spots I've been to"}
{"text":"Had a really great meal on Friday evening. The hostess made room for us despite arriving without a reservation and the place being quite busy.   I will preface this review by saying the service here was some of the best I have had. Very friendly and always helpful. The food is excellent and nothing disappointed. Nice selection of wine by the glass. The portions are quite small, but the prices were fair. Just maybe prepare to order a bit more than you might originally plan on. The hummus is essential, and possibly the best in the city."}
