{"text":"WILL NEVER DINE AGAIN. My girlfriend and I had eaten there this evening. Within an hour of consuming they're food have not been able to quit puking. The sushi they had given us was warm. Worst experience, and the people working there seemed to have about careless of our experience."}
{"text":"New favorite sushi joint in the burbs! All the rolls were awesome. Service was on spot. Strange theme going on but not a negative in any way."}
{"text":"We were greeted by three hosts at the door at 8:30, only to be told that they are no longer seating guests. There were empty seats, there was only two of us, but we were told that the kitchen was closing soon. The restaurant hours clearly stated open until 10:00. Extremely disappointing to be turned away at 8:30 on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Well it's been a while since I've written a review on Yelp and frankly I've been remiss for not doing so.  We moved to Pittsburgh (from San Francisco) a couple years ago and have been enjoying the emergence of the Pittsburgh food scene.  More reviews will follow - as the food experiences are good and improving in this town.  I say in this town, but sadly there are no signs of life in my neighborhood, Sewickley.  Devoid of any half-decent restaurants, we've long been resigned to having to drive to the City and the East End to get our eat on.  But we were cautiously optimistic when we learned that a new sushi joint was to open right on our doorstep in Sewickley.  The caution was well-placed. We've been to the Slippery Mermaid a couple of times now and will not be going back.  We had a half-decent lunch there a few weeks ago.  We were prepared to overlook some of the odd design choices (the crockery looks more improvised than chosen with any design concept in mind), and even the clumsy service (this is Sewickley, after all).  But we ordered take-out tonight and what we got was beyond awful.  First, my wife had to wait for about 50 minutes for a couple of standard menu items (which she phoned in way in advance).  There was hardly anyone in the restaurant, and they had to call her because they were confused over the order (which she'd placed over the web).  If this wasn't odd enough as she sat waiting for the food (long after she'd ordered it) she listened as stories unfolded about orders to Sewickley having been phoned into the Florida sister property (for goodness' sake!)  After an interminable delay the sushi was ready.  The order - though scarcely extravagant - cost $80.  This would have been expensive where the good restaurants are in Pittsburgh.  It's exorbitant in a culinary backwater like Sewickley.  We unpacked the food and found that the rice (part of the menu that we'd bought) had been omitted from the order.  Extremely irritating in and of itself.  But then there was the fish.  It looked passable - if you ignored the garnish of slices of red cabbage leaf that were browned around the edges.  The fish itself was tasteless, too cold (amazing given just how long we'd been forced to wait for the food!)  The squid and Octopus (normal favorites of ours) were tough to the point that they were too hard to eat.  And the fish was generally poorly cut.  The salmon in particular was awful - with large slices of tasteless fish - as if they'd been cut with a dessert spoon.  You have no idea how long and how desperately we've been calling for a sushi restaurant in this neighborhood.  We've found a surprisingly excellent provider up on Route 8 in Gibsonia (http://www.yelp.com/biz/k-asian-bistro-allison-park in case you're interested).  But Slippery Mermaid, despite charging a big multiple of their prices, delivers both service and food that is nowhere near as good."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  The service is quick and friendly, the restaurant is clean and the décor is nice.  The food is delicious. We had sushi and sashimi.  We ordered several rolls and miso soup. Everything was fresh and tasted great. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I have tried sushi twice in my life and both times I wasn't a fan so when a friend suggested The Slippery Mermaid for lunch, I was wary. I ordered the crab roll and Steeler pleaser - and it was amazing! Our server briefly discussed the menu, pointed out local and personal favorites, and asked questions to steer us in the right direction. The menu is quite extensive and I had a hard time deciding what to order. I loved what I ordered, and will go back to try the other selections. I also ordered the pineapple mojito and it was fantastic - a perfect blend of fruit and mint.   Our server was friendly, quick and attentive. Overall, one of the best dining experience. Highly reccomend people check out The Slippery Mermaid, even if you aren't keen on sushi like I was. This place will make you a sushi fan!"}
{"text":"With so many places serving sushi now, it's hard to find one that really stands out. This place is it! Its fresh and delicious! The price is exactly what I thought it should be for quality sushi. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"As far as Pittsburgh-are sushi goes, this place is better than most (for more traditional sushi there is \"Sushi\" in Oxford Center), and I have never had a bad meal, here, though I tend to stick with the things that I like. Recently they have opened an indoor Tiki Bar and there is outside seating behind the restaurant, which is nice for cooler summer evenings.  Based upon what I have paid at other local locations where the sushi is made fresh, I don't think the prices are that out of line and there is certainly a great many options not found at most other places.  If I have one complaint, it is that they are no longer BYOB since the bar opened, and if you are a wine drinker, the bar is not cheap. Currently there is no Happy Hour which means that you pay $8 for a glass of the house white, which costs $9.99/bottle in the PLCB store 110 ft away.  Pittsburgh is known for the obscene way in which restaurants overprice drinks, especially wine, and a 400% markup is not uncommon though I don't expect to pay that much for what is, essentially, a neighborhood eatery. For now, I'll be getting take out and saving my money for the sushi."}
{"text":"Arguably the best sushi I have ever had...ever...Nobu, Umi, yep, like this place is my favorite. I have eaten here perhaps 30 times, maybe more.  The wait for food is always at least an hour, at least.  But, moreover, there has been at least three occasions when I have showed up well before closing time (45+ min)- and been told I cannot be seated.    Tonight, I showed up at 7:10 with my wife, there are a few tables open on the restaurant side and many more open on the bar side.  I am told I cannot be seated in the bar area because the kitchen is too backed up.  The previous occasion I was here, with a group of 8 guys, we nearly left because we weren't permitted to even SIT in the patio area and have drinks because the KITCHEN was too backed up??  We stayed because the bartender realized we were utterly annoyed with the owners actions, so he did everything he could to make us feel welcome- great dude.  Very good wait staff and bartender, and GREAT sushi but I won't be back."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is definitely unique. The decor is different than most and I appreciate that. The food is great for those of us who aren't really into the whole raw sushi thing... so many more options for rolls, which is really nice! Something on the menu for everyone! I must say it doesn't seem too family friendly, more appropriate for a date night without kids due to the long wait for food. The service was not the best... server was nice, but everything was just super slow! If I had my kids with me... we would have had to leave before you got our food and they have pretty decent attention spans at restaurants. Best sushi in town though!!! Make sure it's an adult evening out and you have a lot of time to wait for really yummy sushi."}
{"text":"Expect to wait over an hour to receive two rolls of sushi and then be treated with annoyance from the staff when you ask for your meal to go.  The ambiance and decor is great, however I wouldn't recommend a jaunt out of the city for imitation crab that requires an hour to prepare on a Tuesday evening."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! I love that they always have specials and different featured sushi rolls. I've always had quick service here and I would recommend it to anyone in the surrounding areas to definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"I went to the slippery mermaid for the first time tonight and it was fantastic! The sushi was amazing and the service was impeccable! Abby W was my server and she was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I will come back for sure because of Abby. I recommend this place to anyone and if I could give it more than 5 stars I would!"}
{"text":"The Sewickley branch of The Slippery Mermaid is just a few weeks old with the original location in Navarre, Florida.   I'm grateful for another dining option in Sewickley.  It's BYOB with a $5 corkage fee per bottle.  Hooray!  I gave them a few weeks since they opened before visiting and taking a stab at a review.  I've even visited twice - once on a weekend dinner and again for a weekday lunch.  I'm willing to chalk it up to inexperience in the very youthful looking sushi chefs that were working on both visits.  There were three chefs behind the counter working and they still could not keep up with the pace.  The first visit was a completely packed house - and it took 45+ minutes to get our food.    The second visit there were only three other tables that were occupied and it still took 45+ minutes to get our food.  Something is not quite right here.  Again, I'm willing to grant grace here since they might not have their groove since they opened.    Service is OK.  No updates given by our server for the very long wait on both visits.    The food was tasty enough.  But by the time the food arrived, I was just happy to have something to eat to take the edge off the very long wait times on both visits.  On our first visit, here's what our family had:  California Roll from the kids menu - $6.  My 7 year old was very pleased!  10 pieces in all for this and it was probably the best value on the menu.  Tempura shrimp roll - $9.  The cream cheese in this is totally unnecessary but tasty enough.  Tropical Mermaid-Shrimp Tempura Roll with toasted coconut both inside & out, finished with sweet thai chili sauce - $10.  This thing is so sickly sweet between the thai chili sauce and the coconut.  My wife loved it though!  The Dragon Roll-Spicy Tuna Roll topped with yellowfin tuna, eel, avocado,tobiko, tempura crunchies, scallions and finished with three sauces; zesty aioli, sweet soy reduction, and sriracha - $12.  This was tasty but the eel just didn't seem to go on this.  The crunch factor was good since there are a lot of mushy elements to this roll.  After corkage fee ($5 for one bottle of wine we brought) and drinks for the kids it came to $57 after tax and tip.    I'm willing to give this place another shot since the Asian food options nearby and on this side of the river are limited and not all that appetizing.  There doesn't seem to be a shortage of sushi chefs working at The Slippery Mermaid which makes me wonder why it took so long for food to be leaving the sushi counter."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat in the Village of Sewickley. The variety of sushi & sashimi are unbelievable from the basic to the unusual to the very own Pittsburgh roll. The portions were just perfect and everything was fresh! Love the place and the location."}
{"text":"I've been eating sushi since I was in a training bra. I've had some of the best and cheapest sushi in Los Angeles. It's always fun to travel and try to find better. The Slippery Mermaid delivers. Menu variety should have something for everyone. The triple tuna role is pretty and yummy.   Decor is fun and colorful. Not Japanese cliche at all. And if you want to really trip out, the sushi chefs are white boys. A first for me.  Good times."}
{"text":"Great sushi at a fair price. They give you a good size roll, and everything tastes very fresh. We will definitely be stopping back soon."}
{"text":"Good food - HORRIBLE service. Been there a couple of times eat-in and they wait staff have taken forever to get to us and barely checked in to see if we needed anything both times. Also done carry out and they never even started making our food until after we showed up - 30 mins after ordering. Unless you're ok with awful service, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The service has declined at the Mermaid. We arrived at the restaurant an hour and a half before close. We were turned away. Not to mention that the hours of operation are incorrect. The website states as well as Yelp the restaurant is open until 10:00 on Saturdays. So technically, we arrived two and a half hours ahead.  Called to speak to Manager. The hostess was extremely rude and the Manager would not take the call. This is the second time in the last three months we have gone and there were issues.  Also went a different time and the restaurant was closed when the hours in the door show it should have been opened.  They have become unreliable and miss managed. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Actually the food is decent (not great, but decent) based on 3 previous meals, but closed at 8:45pm on a Saturday night...15 minutes earlier than posted hours????  That is either lazy or arrogant - either is a reason to not go ever back.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Delicious, interesting spin on typical sushi. The bar is a great time."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Sushi is delicious and so are the cocktails!  Interior is just a cute tiki bar look, nothing fancy.  Get there early for a table on a weekend night!"}
{"text":"I hated sushi before I went to this place. Now I am hooked. I can't comment on service because we always do take out but the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is probably not a bad place for people who like to say they really like sushi but don't really like sushi.  The menu is disorganized and the offerings are dominated by enough over-the-top concoctions to make Guy Fieri blush.  For example, the \"Sexy Mermaid\" consists of \"steamed shrimp, cream cheese, bacon, fresh jalapeños and tempura crunch inside; topped with yellowfin tuna, house garlic sauce, sriracha, fresh cilantro and thin lime slices.\"    When you don't cook the fish, knife skills are essential.  The last time we were there, most of the fish was poorly cut. The tuna in the poke seemed to be cut with the grain of the fish making it chewy.  The raw onion masked anything that might be mistaken for flavor.    The decor is more Trader Joe's than tiki, and the front-of-house staff seemed entirely disengaged.  Through out our entire meal, we sat behind a table of ten teenaged-girls who spent 45 minutes brushing and braiding each other's hair, 10 feet from the open kitchen.  Not the most appetizing way to spend an evening.    If you're looking for \"sushi\" in Sewickly, this is pretty much your only option, but I'd consider a drive if you have the time."}
{"text":"To all of you who have worked in the service industry... tell me....if you close at 9pm and someone walks in...Don't you serve them?YES!! And if they walk in at 8:30pm....you serve them!  I remember multiple times working at a restaurant and having guests walk in close to closing time!! Yeah...kinda was not ideal to stay a little longer past , \"closing time\"....however....we never turned them away! AND HONESTLY...those people tipped more than anyone because I had more time to be more attentive!! You can still get things done to leave while people eat!  When we walked into the Slippery Mermaid Sewickey it was 8:35pm and the hostess commented, \"You know we close at nine?\" We proceeded to tell her that we knew that...but it was 8:35pm!!! We had even called ahead to see if we could get a table around 8:30pm...they said , \" YES that will be fine.\"-- IF IT WAS NOT FINE AND WE WOULD BE TREATED RUDELY...  WE WOULD NOT HAVE WASTED OUR TIME AT YOUR ESTABLISHMENT.   She rudely sat us in the bar area. She then proceeded to talk unenthused and quite upset we were there to the bartender who would be taking care of us. We decided to just leave. They made it TOTALLY obvious we were not wanted there....because it was CLOSE TO CLOSING TIME!! No one reassured us we were okay to stay....they looked happy at this point that we were leaving!! What a JOKE!?  We called the Slippery Mermaid when we left and asked ,\"What time is an acceptable time to be seated at your restaurant\" and the girl who answered the phone said, \"8:30pm\". We asked to then talk with the manager....and he was unconcerned when we told him why we were upset. I could go on about what I think about him....if it was really even the manager....or just a fellow employee pretending.  Honestly..... we were upset that we drove all the way to Sewickley to be treated that way. My boyfriend was not able to eat the sushi others rave about and won't be making another trip there again to ever do so!! I liked the food the first two times I went but I WITHOUT A DOUBT WILL BE SURE to tell everyone I know how rude and unprofessional their staff treated us. From sharing my experience--- there are plenty of others who have experienced similar situations at this location.  It is truly sad! To ALSO make matters worse-- my boyfriend works out of town and this week he was home. What a wonderful date night RUINED by unprofessional employees. By the time we went elsewhere to eat he was just too hot and fired up to do so.   If you are open till 9....you are seating until 9----PERIOD.   I sure do hope you teach your staff some manors!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent sushi!  Had the tuna and it was excellent.  They have a great little patio to sit outside (weather permitting) Friendly staff, good service."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place. It used to be very good food. But the last couple times I went, there was a lack of ingredients in their sushi rolls, and the service is horrible. The owner has a bunch of what seem like teenagers running the place and the manager has not a clue how to run a business or deal with customers. I have seen the Waitress and hostess stand around on their phones, while customers go without drink refills and forever getting service. It's a shame really, there was potential for this place to do well, but the caliber of kids they are hiring to run it will keep them from having a lasting business. Disappointing."}
{"text":"After my wife has gone to Slippery Mermaid several times with friends, I experienced it for myself. A hefty menu of sushi, it's a little hard to decide what to get. I went with the Spicy Mermaid, Dragon and Poseidon Rolls. All very good. All very large. Each roll was 8 pieces each. Great sauces on top of each different roll.   The dining room is nice but there are not nearly enough tables for the crowds that wanted to eat there on a Friday night. There are a few areas that have a lot of open space where they can add a few more tables in my opinion.  The bar area has extra seating and has a tiki feel. There's a specialty drink menu that has some interesting concoctions.  Overall a great dinner. I'll go back, but will be careful to get there early so not to spend most of my night waiting for a table."}
{"text":"This is the place everyone's been telling me to go? Seriously? It looks like a long John silvers that a 30-something year old hipster bought with his trust fund money as a joke. Theres fake bamboo STAPLED to the walls, y'all. STAPLED.  Anyways, if you're interested in paying too much to eat in a bright-teal hellscape where forty year old white dudes named Rob are making your sushi, get at this place. The food is pretty good, not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and good service. Sushi was really, really good. As the site says, it does not strive for \"traditional,\" but to be inventive. So if you only like traditional, you might not like this. However, I thought their approach worked. Presentation was good, flavors went together very well. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I went for the first time to the Slippery Mermaid with my family because I had heard good things about their sushi rolls. I brought my newborn with my family and was told by the hostess that we were unable to be seated on one half of the restaurant because a bar was located on that side. I had never heard of such a rule at a regular sit down restaurant. We waited over 30 minutes and watched both large and small parties be seated ahead of us. We were finally told our table was ready on the restaurant-only side, but then the manager stepped in to say tables were not allowed to pushed together. At this point we spoke with the manager and he was unapologetic for the long unexplained wait. Bad customer service. Slippery Mermaid just lost 6 new customers. They are not a family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place in the Pittsburgh area. If you like spicy tuna rolls, the Slippery Mermaid has  awesome specialty tuna rolls. The restaurant is Tiki Bar themed. The sushi rolls are always great. Definitely worth the drive to Sewickley."}
{"text":"Used to eat here weekly. They do have decent sushi....but this just told me, on a Monday, theyre too busy and cant do takeout orders!?! No thanks, Ill be taking my business elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"The sushi here was really fresh and good. We got 4 rolls, and were worried about being able to finish all of them, but then the next thing you know they were GONE! Prices are what you would expect for Sewickley and for sushi, so no surprises there. Overall, I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"We love love love sushi , so finding new places is always fun. We were hanging with friends who always come here so we decided to.  We ordered an assortment of rolls between of four or us. I can't remember them all but to be honest , they were all very good. All the food was fresh and the rolls were full.  About 8 pieces come with each roll you select.   It appeared the most of the rolls were similar. They had lots of options, but they were all very similar. They just changed one or two items in each roll. It wasn't a bad thing to me but my boyfriend loves options and he felt like there weren't as many. I didn't mind at all. The other reason I didn't give 5 stars is because service was not great. It wasn't full at all, so it was kind of strange. We waited about 20 to 25 minutes after we sat down to order food after we ordered drinks. Luckily, we were there with a small group so it wasn't bad but it was really noticeable.  The prices for the food was super comparable and competitive for what we ordered. I thought it was cheaper to there than other places we go to. We would definitely go again to try out other options."}
{"text":"I love the mermaid theme. It has a very good feel to it. The food was okay.   We tried a couple different rolls. The have their signature created rolls which I didn't like at all. The standard regular rolls(california, rainbow, philly, spicy tuna etc.) were decent. drinks were ehh.  Not cheap either. I doubt I would come here again."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is very slow. A lot of young servers. If you have the time to wait, it's worth it. Tonight we ordered take out and they forgot half our order. Had to drive back to get the rest of the order. Manager was \"too busy\" to take care of us then. We were refunded but the staff really needs training on customer service."}
{"text":"I give this 3 stars because my experience here has never been consistent. A few years ago, this was one of the best places for sushi, but I'm not quite sure what happened since then. The quality of the sushi has declined, and the service is just awful most of the time. I waited an hour for my food when the restaurant was not that busy and the waitress seemed uninterested in returning to my table to take drink orders. Unfortunately, I no longer feel that it's worth the drive to Sewickley to eat here."}
{"text":"Overall great place I was debating on review 3 or 4 stars   Overall The staff was very friendly and the food is very good so I gave them for... Their biggest drawback is it is basically just sushi rolled up very very western influence style not much at all Asian about this place   But overall it is a little pricey but not too too bad and staff is extremely friendly, the place is very clean and hip and the food is always good"}
{"text":"This place was very cute, and pretty good sushi. I had heard such amazing things maybe I was just expecting more? I did enjoy my sushi and had very friendly and good service by a lovely waitress. It's good sushi.. not complaining. I just have had better in this Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Loved this new restaurant.  My husband and I had the Red Headed Mermaid, The Merman & the Peck-n-Roll.  The Merman was the favorite for both of us.  While one would think a roll having seared steak on it would be strange, it was amazing!  The peck-n-roll we didn't much care for.  It had grilled chicken in it and was a bit bland.  We will definitely be back to try other rolls."}
{"text":"This restaurant was not what I expected. It had almost a beach feel with its bright colors and mermaid theme. These specialty drink menu was all tropical as well. It was a nice change from the traditional Japanese sushi restaurants.  I would have liked to try a platter with several different types of sushi but their menu seemed to lack this option. We tried several different sushi rolls and were impressed with them all. They were out of edamame. My drink was decently strong although the $12 price tag discouraged me from ordering more than one. Our server was kind and attentive."}
{"text":"Great spot! I liked the atmosphere, the employees were great, and the food was awesome!  My goto sushi spot when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is the BEST sushi place for those of us that don't really \"do\" real sushi!! I am not a big fan of fish that is cooked, so to eat it raw is just too much for me. I really do enjoy sushi rolls, however, and the Slippery Mermaid gives people like me so many more options than just California or Shrimp Tempura rolls.  The Tropical Mermaid is my favorite, but I also love the Steeler's Pleaser and the Psycho Mermaid.  Also, the Tiki Bar has some amazing cocktails - the pineapple mojito is my favorite!! The atmosphere is great - very bright and cheery and clean!! I highly recommend a trip to The Slippery Mermaid!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi joint in Pittsburgh!  We have stopped in 3 times since they opened; the food and service has always been exceptional!  Don't change a thing."}
{"text":"OK at best. Bland interior. And what kind of sushi bar has you looking at a wall 18 inches from your face? You're supposed to watch the sushi being prepared by artists. The food was ho hum; the sushi about as good as the Giant Eagle's. Very high proportion of rice.The salad dressing (which I wanted to be that great Japanese ginger dressing) was not good at all, perhaps out of a bottle. Hey, perhaps out of a bottle from Giant Eagle!  Service was adequate. Well now, they did forget my salad.  Other reviewers have seemed happy to have sushi in Sewickley at last. I enjoy sushi, but I will be driving elsewhere to get it."}
{"text":"If I never would have eaten in, this review would be 4 stars as takeout is sometimes a few minutes late but manageable and the food is very good.  The issue is that I went to eat here last night and it took 1 1/2 hours to bring sushi to my table of 6.  Are you kidding me???!!!  I know it was a Friday during lent but please, service should be way better.  This place is not that large and the ratio of employees to customers was very high.  We didn't see our waitress for over 20min at one point.  After the extremely long wait, we asked for an additional roll and we're told it would be 35min.  The food is really good but that does not offset the long lead times and questionable service."}
{"text":"Cute little gem in Sewickly. Great fresh sushi. Everything was delicious! Our server Melissa was great and friendly as well."}
{"text":"I downloaded this app just to leave a negative review because my experience here was THAT bad, I never do this. I ordered over the phone and the girl I talked to was so rude, I felt like I couldn't even ask a question about the roll I was ordering. You can definitely tell the kids working here are just bratty little rich Sewickley teens whose parents made them get a job. The sushi was horrible, I ordered an avocado roll and it was disgusting. I had to pick out all the avocado because it was nasty and old.  Hire good people who will treat your customers with respect and don't serve anything that's not fresh, this is disgraceful, especially for the price! If I'm paying this much money for sushi, I at least expect the ingredients to be fresh. I am truly appalled. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Lots LOTS of choices. Almost too many choices for rolls. Rolls are pretty large and there are some interesting combinations. It's not the best sushi I've ever had, which is why only four imaginary internet stars."}
{"text":"This was the closet sushi place to my hotel so decided to stop by.  I got lucky with parking on the curb across from it otherwise good luck!  The server was super chill and laid back.... She called me \"girlie\" the whole time.  I thought that was weird being double her age but I got over it.  The have a few GF (gluten free) items on the menu and were accommodating when I wanted to remove the crunchies off a roll to make it GF.  I ordered the 8 piece sashimi chef choice.  They included cooked shrimp in it.  I thought that was cheap because that's really not sashimi.  The fish was fresh and cut in bite size pieces.  Nice presentation.  The Tritan Tuna roll was the 2nd order and in asked to remove the  crunchies.  After waiting 20 minutes at 6:00 on a Thursday, it finally showed up wrong.  It had the crunchies on it.  They took it back and brought out a new one.  I asked for gluten free soy sauce and she brought out a small square dish and failed to telle that she was charging me extra for it.  No where on the menu does it say that gluten free soy sauce costs extra.  The roll was good.  I also ordered the edamame which was so salty!  They literally dumped a shaker of salt on it.  Got the check and was shocked to see that the soy sauce cost me $.75.  I realize that its only $.75 but really?????  I find that ridiculous! I can't say I would come back as there are other sushi places that serve fresh fish.  The rolls were priced a little high for the size and quantity."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner Wednesday and ate Psycho Mermaid and Merman Sushi rolls both were very good."}
{"text":"Sushi, oh sushi... how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.  I probably eat sushi once a week at minimum.  Sometimes more, never less.  Yet I had never been to the Slippery Mermaid!  I know, I know. I'll give you a moment to pick your jaw up off the floor... got it?  Good? Ok.  I stopped in here for dinner with a friend this week and loved the bright, clean, and airy décor.  We got here at 4:30 on a Thursday so there was no issue with getting a table on the sushi bar side right away.   I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, the Tuna Reef salad, and the Whale of a Roll.  Our waitress was so nice and our food arrived SO fast.  I think it was less than 5 minutes before my Tuna Reef salad was in front of me.  I could probably order this every day for the rest of my life and not get sick of it - it's everything I love.  Nicely sized pieces of fresh yellowfin tuna served over a decent helping of seaweed salad for $10?  I'll take two!  So good.  I will definitely be back even if it's just to eat this as my meal!     Our rolls came out shortly after, and holy moly - they almost looked too good to eat.  I was extremely impressed with the construction of these rolls.  Everything held together well, the fish/fillings were perfectly portioned, and the rice was excellent.  I loved how each piece was soft and easy to consume in one bite.  I've been to many a sushi place and can tell you that more often than not, they pack their rolls too tight.  These were perfectly done.  And while the rolls are all dolled up with varying sauces and garnishes, I didn't feel like it was overdone.  The sweet chili sauce that was drizzled on my roll was just enough to add a sweet punch of flavor without overpowering or masking the fish itself.  My bill for the three items (wine, salad, and roll) was $35 and I left here feeling content and happy with my meal. You can't put a price on that.  I imagine I'll be back here trying some of their other crazy creations very, very soon!"}
{"text":"The sushi was mediocre. Our appetizers arrived at the same time as our meal, which was very annoying. The service was good, but, the food was just okay. The kids Rice Bowls were weak.. they only had chicken and teriyaki sauce, no veggies or anything. Totally disappointing. This place needs some work.."}
{"text":"Am I in Mahnattan?!!?  Finally, a place that takes the time and has the necessary knowledge and ingredients to make the most amazing tiki cocktails around.  My wife and friends love sushi but I'm typically on the boring side and the waitress was extremely helpful in recommending some rolls that I absolutely loved.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very extensive and creative sushi menu.  I like the kitschy tiki/beachy theme of the restaurant and its offerings.  It can get pricey quickly once you start getting into those special rolls, but it's very tasty and I've always left satisfied.  One thing I've noticed consistently is that service can be slightly standoffish.  I'm not sure how better to describe it--not rude, but not overly friendly.  Overall, I'm glad to see something other than a café or high end new American/Continental restaurant added to the Sewickley scene, and I will continue to be an occasional patron of the \"Slippy Mermaid\", as I like to call it."}
{"text":"Came for pick up. Ordered Miso soup. Picked up delivery. In car no soup. Came back. Waitress very snappy to me stating \"out of soup\". Terrible way to treat a customer!!!"}
{"text":"I wake up craving slippery mermaid ! I like their friendly staff and  most of all their amazing sushi!! The steelers pleaser is by far the best sushi I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This rating is based on their poor and arrogant customer service, we were satisfied with the food. Sushi rolls were different than traditional Japanese, I though their sashimi was scarce for the price, but overall good food.  Here is my issue, we waited for almost an hour, had drinks at the bar and waited for a table, after being told that it would only be about a 20min wait. Then after being seated waited over 15min to get our first Apps, we ordered our main rolls and then wanted to order more rolls and were told the kitchen was closed at 9pm. The restaurant was still mostly filled and they would not serve us any more food, the waiter offered us some sushi rice to take out instead. Unreal! I can't believe that you would turn away paying customers at 9pm. They have a popular business, but are not very good at running a business. It felt like a bunch of snooty preppy kids running the place and really didn't care about their customers and catered to only specific people they knew.  If your a good sushi chef and know a little about customer service, there is a great business opportunity in Sewickley, Pennsylvania.  We had to order a pizza from Angelia's to satisfy our hunger, they serve pizza's past 9pm in Moon County."}
{"text":"I've been many places around the world and have had some truly excellent sushi. I thought Slippery Mermaid was a tasty dinner. I was pleased with my experience. Nice ambiance too."}
{"text":"I was very happy with everything at the slippery mermaid. The reviews that slam this place for their decor and give them a bad rating is just silly.   There is parking on the street, convenient. If you haven't been to Sewickley, you should check it out.. beautiful town.   The restaurant itself is poorly lit (I'll say that) but other than that I was really digging the palm trees, bamboo walls, bright blue paint.. I felt like I was somewhere tropical!  I ordered a pineapple mojito which was great but a little too sweet for me, next I had a glass of salv Blanca which was cold & delicious, huge serving.  The sushi was FRESH, and my signature roll was out of this world.  Our waitress was sweet and attentive.    Hours are a little silly so check them before you plan a trip to SM.   5 starts, loved It here and can't wait to go back.  Rumor has it there is outdoor seating in warmer months, think I may be able to bring my 4 legged BFF."}
{"text":"I desperately wanted to love this place.  On paper it looks creative and exciting and the place is cute. But in reality the sushi is an abusive and tasteless rice fest with barely anything inside. The sushi was very amateur looking, and the massive amount of rice waste was 4x bigger than the amount of sushi to actually eat.  The wasabi had zero flavor and I couldn't even find the cream cheese in my Philadelphia roll.  Mind you, this was a takeout order, so I couldn't ask for a redo.  Not only that, but when I arrived I asked for a takeout menu. I was told to view the menu online because they like to \"keep it green here.\" Yet my takeout order was packed in 2 huge STYROFOAM containers.    The one thing I can give them credit for is that their spicy tuna is actually spicy, which is often a rarity in sushi restaurants.  Nonetheless, I won't be returning.  UPDATE 3/14 -  I decided to try again. I got the miso soup and the New Wave Sashimi appetizer. all I can say is, they've redeemed themselves and I now get this a few times a month. they're choice of cardboard container for the soup is treble though, as it a soggy mess by the time I get it home, so I've stopped getting the soup."}
{"text":"Very cozy and friendly environment with self seating. Fun menu and reasonably priced sushi. We were very happy with our meal and our service. Would definitely try this place again or recommend it to a friend!"}
{"text":"Only in town for afternoon and wanted a quick bite to eat. Had the flirty mermaid that was outstanding! Server was attentive and helpful. Sat outside and enjoyed the sunshine.  Nice glass of wine.  Two different locals recommended the slippery mermaid and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Drove out to the Slippery Mermaid on a Friday night from the South Hills. We arrived at 8:42pm and were greeted by two teenage girls at the door. We were promptly told that they would no longer be seating any more guests as they were busy and close at 9pm. There was no line or no wait. My wife  looked at the girls and told them we just drove from the South Hills. Their reply was \"sorry.\" This place gets an F for customer service. I have never experienced anything like this before in my life. Why have a closing time? The girls were more concerned about getting out of there to meet up with their friends. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.   Prices a little high. Service was surprisingly slow for how few customers on a Thursday night.   Music was a little too loud, but the place is cool looking.   If I'm every in Sewickley again. I'll stop back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Very convenient location, nice atmosphere. One of my favorite restaurants in Sewickley."}
{"text":"Sushi gem in Sewickley! Aside from the run of the mill sushi offerings, they offer creative varieties of sushi. The vibe feels coastal/tropical, and stepping into the restaurant feels like you're on vacation. Rolls are generously sized yet are not overwhelming. I haven't tried the cocktails here, but my friends who have say it complements the sushi well."}
{"text":"My current favorite local sushi restaurant. The food is great, the service is always friendly, and they now even have a full bar. :-) They have cooked food in stuff that looks like sushi, too, so you can take people who aren't a fan of sushi. Prices are reasonable and the sushi is great - if you like sushi and haven't been to The Slippery Mermaid, you're really missing out. Go now!"}
{"text":"The manager needs a lesson in treating people with dignity. Childish and classless. Won't go there. Ever."}
{"text":"Sushi is by far one of the best around Pittsburgh....don't let the gringo chefs fool ya these guys know how to roll and prepare their sushi. Clean restaurant and good variety of sushi and accompaniments. Prices are average for sushi which means you are getting a tasty bargain even if it's in the fancy town of Sewickley;)"}
{"text":"Previously, one of our favorite spots until we experienced the culture of the management.  As stated on the website, they close at 10PM.  We were rushed out at 9 as the staff closed the sushi bar down.  We arrived at 7:45 and were seated at 8:15...proceeded to promptly order with our \"starter\"(as stated to the waitress).  She asked if we wanted anything else (10 minutes may have transpired tops), when we ordered 2 more rolls.  She proceeded to come back and tell us the kitchen was closed at 9.  The \"owner's son\" wouldn't even come over to apologize.  The waitress apologized.  Terrible management."}
{"text":"Hours to 10 pm are only in the summer. And whoever owns this place needs to speak with their employees about being too eager to go home. We got there at 9:01 and were turned away. That's no way to run a business."}
{"text":"They have an extensive menu and you can't get these types of rolls at this price anywhere else. The staff was friendly and the place was packed. They have an awesome wine dispenser that looks like a kegerator so who wouldn't love that. Their beer selection is limited but they do have a full bar."}
{"text":"I read multiple negative reviews, mostly stating that the food was good and the Service was bad...... I agree completely on the food, and couldn't disagree more on the service. Sam was our server and she was awesome. The sushi was fantastic. I'm not into the bacon with sushi thing, but other than that everything was exceptional. Also, it was a great deal. Two of us ate a lot of food for $56 combined, and had good drinks at $11 each.  The drink deal isn't great, but the sushi was."}
{"text":"We went here last night. It was a fun experience. Their pineapple mojito was delightful. Their sushi rolls look like pieces of art. The owner/chef is a young fellow but has his act together. He recommended some things for one of us to eat since she has a gluten allergy. He made her 2 special rolls which she said were amazing. We ate in the tiki bar side which just opened in June. They do have outside seating as well with a fire pit for when it gets warmer. It's in Sewickley. The pricing was very reasonable and the rolls were delicious. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and great casual atmosphere.  Prices are very fair.  Service was TERRIBLE.  Had to beg for service.  Initially sat outside but could smell their garbage so moved inside.  Recommended if you sit inside and are very patient."}
{"text":"All the rolls are upward of 10 dollars, but so worth it! We got 5 rolls and they were all so good. Shout out to the Sexy Mermaid roll and the Steeler roll. The only part I would complain about is the sashimi yellowtail wasn't sliced thinly. (I know this is all personal preference and some prefer it that way)"}
{"text":"Me and two girlfriends just ate an absurd amount of sushi and all said it is the best sushi we have ever had! So many choices! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Sushi was very good, and very fresh. This is one of your better sushi bars around the area... my only grip is the service was sub par. Our waitress did not stop by very often at all, espically when we needed something... other than that parking is on street so expect to walk a block or so... but no complaints at all about the quality of food, that is spot on."}
{"text":"Very glad to have this restaurant in the area. Great service, clean atmosphere, kid friendly, excellent sushi. They have a lot of cooked, veggie options that are easy to identify by the mermaid icon on their menu"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place!  It's one of our new favorites in Sewickley & Pittsburgh area. The other evening was a 2nd time in 2 weeks, and we brought a friend along, and now he's a fan too.  We love their sushi, Rock-n-Roll, Flirty Mermaid, and Dragon Roll just to name a few.  Good edamame too!  We liked the Ahi Tuna Poké as well, just thought the raw tuna pieces needed a little more marinade and seasoning.    Their House Bar Drinks are phenomenal, especially the \"Pain Killer\" and the \"Jet Pilot\" which thanks to the 150 proof rum & other rums, etc. added to this drink, makes you feel like you're flying at 30,000 feet!  Would love to someday try their pitcher of Sangria.    Eddie our server the first time we were there, was fantastic, and at the bar, both Trey, and Reese (who runs the place), are both very competent at making great drinks!  Make sure if you go, that you try to get an outdoor, patio table, and ask them to bring some sampling of the sauces & aioli's in addition to what you have on your plated sushi.  Fun place to hang out, with patio-centered long gas fire pit on such a beautiful evening.  Check out the indoor Tiki Bar too!  Very Cool!  Stay Great Slippery Mermaid!!"}
{"text":"Very interesting menu, but probably the worst service that I've ever experienced at a restaurant. Not only are they extremely slow, but the staff just does not seem to care about anything. While it was initially exciting to have a sushi place in Sewickley, you might as well drive somewhere else because you could have dinner at least 3 times at another restaurant  in the time that it takes this place to bring you a sushi roll."}
{"text":"Great staff. Great sushi... best in the area with the exception of K's Asian Bistro in Hampton. The wait is incredibly long. No call ahead or reservations. Take out orders are rarely ready in time.   Here's why two stars...the management/owner is incredibly rude and unprofessional. I have been to the Mermaid over a half dozen times and last night may have been my last. I was with a party of six and we knew that there always is a wait so we had a couple beers at the bar and placed our food order there. We kept it very simple by just ordering about three rolls of four different types. The order was ready and the owner would not serve us because there was no table for us, even though there was outdoor seating for about 30. After a not not so friendly discussion with the owner, we were permitted to eat outside.  It's almost funny that we had to negotiate with the owner to spend ~$500 at her establishment.   Bottom line... very good sushi and wait staff. Very poor management and ownership."}
{"text":"AMAZING food! I have never waited more than 45 minutes for rolls and thats only when it is jam packed. I don't mind the wait though because I know all the roll are being made individually, by hand, to order. Thats rare these days. TONS of options, including gluten free and I have seen some amazing veggie rolls come out of that kitchen. The menu is large but the servers that I have had seem to know the menu very well and can usually help aim you in the right direction to something you will enjoy! Never had a roll I didn't like.

{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a while. My sister and I finally went for the first time today, and we loved it! Everything was tasty as well as aesthetically pleasing. I had the Freaky Mermaid roll and a pineapple mojito - they were both soooo good. We also had seaweed salad, edamame, and Sashimi to start. Needless to say, we went all out, and we weren't disappointed! Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Second time here, should have stopped after the first. Sushi roll just crambled apart and some how a spicy roll was hot, but bland and tasteless. Worse sushi rice I ever had. Won't be a third trip here...ever."}
{"text":"The Slippery Mermaid has the best sushi anywhere in Pittsburgh area hands down! It's our favorite by far and service is always 100% percent. I have to knock off a star because of our last time there when they decided to sit us in the Tiki room instead of main restaurant. It wasn't a busy time and there were still a lot of tables in main - wish we would have been asked if we had preference. Once in Tiki because of slow time 2 bar tenders and 2 employees talked & laughed loudly nearly entire time we were there and at one point about a really disturbing subject. I understand they were waiting for things to get busy, and really young - but I was still shocked:("}
{"text":"Really neat selection of rolls. Place had a nice vibe with hip selection of music. Indoor outdoor seating with pleasant Atmosphere. Rolls were tasty and neatly put together.  The insane roll was delicious.  Service was friendly but room for improvement.  Will be back as the restaurant is unique, privately owned, and family friendly.   Ignore the overly dramatic one star reviews and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Did takeout for lunch.  Excellent food. Friendly staff.  Food ready in 20 min even though we placed a large order."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the Sewickley/Moon area.  You will not find better sushi or better ambiance anywhere.  The outdoor dining is most preferred by our crew.  The poke is outstanding.  Not sure why they recently switched to disposable plates and cups.  I appreciate it's recyclable materials but it makes it feel a little like fast food."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh & FAT rolls of sushi creatively constructed and served by fun, friendly staff. Love it here!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews before I tried this place out. Yes and the staff is what the reviews say. They staff is sometimes rude, and immature. Prepare yourself for a wait. We waited over an hour for our sushi. It was pretty good. Get the number 1 seller had coconut flavor to it. It was pretty good. But that wait was killer."}
{"text":"Holy moly, this was the best sushi I've ever eaten!! My BFF and I were on a mission to try this place although it was 40 minutes away from her house. We checked the website to be sure they wouldn't close first. Upon arrival, the host had just turned someone away and then he told us that they were closed. But we had driven 40 minutes just to come HERE and the website said it closed at 10pm and it was 9:10pm! It was also my friends birthday, so he agreed to let us in if we ate in the bar area. Alright! We actually ended up eating outside because it was a nice night and they have a firepit and cool ambience out there. We were the only ones out there and we loved it. We ordered the singing mermaid, dragon roll, and the tuna reef roll. We were BLOWN AWAY by the flavors and freshness!! AMAZING. I will be back for more!  Another plus, there's wine ON TAP. Yep, that's right. I had red blend and my friend had Prosecco. Sweet!  Oh, it's also worth mentioning that the owner himself had let us stay after they were closed, our food was prepared very fast, and he was super friendly."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, the service/hosts were horrible. As soon as a I walked into the door, both the hosts looked at me as if I wasn't good enough to come in. So what a great start for an awful experience.   Once I got seated by myself, it took my waitress 15 minutes to even ask what beverage I wanted. Once I sat there and had my meal, I noticed that she was quick to attend her other tables as soon as they were sat in her section.    But It wasn't even that busy, so I assume that the reason it took so long is because the waitresses (in my section) had given my table to the waitress I had today (who had 4 tables already elsewhere ) because why?  To be honest, I couldn't tell you but I tipped my waitress 20% as always.   The other girls would give that \"sour puss\" look to each other once they helped someone. Like, if you hate your job, leave !!   It's a shame, I worked in the food industry and I know what it's like to be a server, never would I ever treat someone like these girls did to me.  I'll make sure to order take out next time.   The food deserves 5 stars but the service sucks"}
{"text":"Variety & decor: round of applause to Slippery Mermaid! #letsrollafatone (genius decoration!)  Let me break down the evening for you...  Couples date night! Four of us arrived around 7:30 and since the place wasn't busy, we were able to pick our own table. The bright colors and unique decorations on the walls give a feel like you're near the beach. The attached bar has a palm tree and the outside seating attempts to mimic a beach town hot spot. It was too cold for outdoor seating so we opted for a corner table close to the kitchen...we were all very hungry...I am excited to go back during warmer weather to get the full experience! We were quickly greeted by our waitress and she explained that their wine is on tap. YES PLEASE! 3 of 4 ordered a different type of red and the 4th ordered a gin & tonic. They are BYOB but now that they have their liquor license, they charge a $30 corking fee. You read that right, $30 DOLLARS! That's a lot of bottles of wine in my book.  We ordered rolls from the gluten free menu. Spicy tuna, salmon but the most notable was the roll with toasted coconut on it!! What a delightful twist! The rolls were fresh, decently sized and the display was excellent. We didn't try the exotic rolls but let me tell you, Slippery Mermaid has superb selection if you like a modern twist on sushi.   Overall, I was very happy with our experience. I can't wait to go back during the warmer months to experience the outdoor Tiki bar! It's set up to simulate a beach front restaurant. Pittsburgh's rivers don't cut it ;)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly cool vibe in Sewickley. Tiki bar is classy and well done. Drink menu has unique and very tasty selections. I think we tried more drinks than sushi rolls. The sushi is also very creative, with quite a selection you won't find elsewhere. Respect the spice. Staff is super friendly. Thanks Sam for making our first trip to the Slippery Mermaid a great experience and definitely not our last."}
{"text":"This place is genetic. It is amazing how long it can take to make sushi. We ordered take away and it was 30-45 to do two rolls. We ordered an avocado and cucumber roll and got the smallest sushi I have ever seen. Pieces were the diameter of a nickel and the avo was almost non existent. And this took 30+ min. The inside and outside smells like cleaning solution. We have eaten onsite before and it isn't a one off. I think they survive on little competition. The one plus is the menu has a nice bit of variety and creativity."}
{"text":"The food alone would get 5 stars but lowered it to three because of their staff and takeout service. The staff, who all appear to be no older than 19, don't know the menu. I ordered their chefs poke bowl after confirming it is the regular mermaid bowl with extra toppings and was disappointed to find unseasoned salmon in place of the flavorful tuna that's on the regular mermaid bowl - nothing special extra. Their manager didn't attempt to rectify the situation.   Lastly, their take out service is horrible. Last time I ordered food at 5:10 and was told it would be done in 10-15 minutes. I get there at 5:30 and my food wasn't done until 5:55 - The food is usually* good but I'm not sure I can justify wasting that long again for hit or miss food again."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying I love the food here. It's really delicious. How far can that get you when the service is absolutely terrible. It seems like everyone who works there is 16 years old and doesn't really care what's going on. And take out service is even worse. They turn the phone off so it rings busy.  So you have to go in to order your takeout  I was told my order would take 30 minutes and then I would be called and notified.  After an hour I went back in and asked about my food. I got a blank stare and then the girl went back into the kitchen and got my food, though I'd never been called about it being ready   So I paid 32 dollars for my dinner and who knows how long it had been sitting there. I'm super disappointed."}
{"text":"Its probably the best place to get sushi in the Pittsburgh area. Prices aren't too bad. I got the pineapple mojito and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had. Customer service was excellent. I would recommend more appetizers on the menu though since there wasn't really any. I would definitely come back though the food was great."}
{"text":"I came with six friends and we had a great time! We all got different rolls so we could try a verity. They have soooo many fun options. But really, everything we tried was really good!! We loved the food, the atmosphere is welcoming, and our waiter was so nice and helpful with all of our questions. Overall it was great!"}
{"text":"Truly a unique sushi experience. They get wacky with their Sushi here. The Merman The Rock and Roll The Slippery mermaid   These rolls were Grrrreeaaat. Flavor packed and expertly layered to give you a sushplosion in your mouth. A little bit pricey, which is expected from anything in the Sewickley area, but most of the good rolls are specialties and you can expect to pay around $14 for them (you get what you pay for)- All in all you won't be taking out a second mortgage to eat here and it is worth every penny.  I should note that the staff was exceptionally kind and should be tipped accordingly. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Good service and friendly staff, but certainly not worth the price. Sushi is mediocre at best, and while items sound delicious on the menu, it just doesn't come together.  I had high hopes, but I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"The service was great/perfect. The sushi was fresh, fast and priced great. Decor and bathrooms were clean. Great location! This is worth an hour too two hour drive. If you are every in or near Navarre FL go to that store also!"}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy environment. Our sushi was pretty meh but they made up for it with impeccable service. Our waiter was really hot and extremely friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a concert a few months ago and we decided to stop here for a bite to eat. I don't eat meat or dairy anymore, so I asked the waitress if there were any vegan-friendly items on the menu. I ended up getting an avocado roll without the cream cheese and the veggie roll. They put honey on the veggie roll because they weren't sure if that was vegan or not. I felt so so awful and embarrassed asking them to remake it for me without honey...but they did so without any kind of complaint or sighs of frustration. The waitress and cook were so comforting, accommodating, and friendly. Place is 5 stars in my book. Not only that...but the decor is total DIY sheek. LOVE it!!"}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly service. Everything is prepared beautifully and tastes even better!"}
{"text":"Fun take on sushi. Had a few rolls and really enjoyed the back patio atmosphere. I'm reserving five stars because I haven't had enough of their other items. Very busy place so make sure you come at the right time."}
{"text":"I need to give the Slippery Mermaid another review because well they deserve it for great sushi. While the decor is odd, the food has been consistently great! I can't give a 5 star because everytime I go there, they are out of things..like last time. they were out of hot sake?? Seems weird to be out of a signture drink...so I placed our order and they were out of what I ordered...service truly needs help. Our server had no idea what many of the items were which only confused us..but when we finally got our meal, the sushi was outstanding. If you want good sushi and don't mind being confused about the menu, having a server who is pretty much useless and them not having want you orginally wanted..this is your place."}
{"text":"I had an \"early release\" schedule...so I wouldn't have to sit in rush hour traffic to get to meet my friend at the Slippery Mermaid.  I am So glad I had that early release day and I am so grateful I chose to spend that time at the Slippery Mermaid!  I had been told that the sushi rolls could be \"sauce heavy\".  So i was prepared.  They were - indeed sauce heavy - but with the most scrumptious sauce ever!    My friend and I each ordered 2 rolls that were very different so we could share and try lots.  There was SO MUCH SUSHI.  But such good sushi!   While the Slippery Mermaid isn't that convenient for this east area of Pgh living gal - I do hope to go back.  If you are really craving some sushi - the drive is worth it."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Slippery Mermaid several times and dispute the fact that the sushi just glorified California Rolls, I have had a pleasant experience. However, after the way that we were treated by management tonight, I do not think we will EVER dine there again. Upon arrival, we did notice that the restaurant was slight full for a Thursday night, but with the local schools being on spring break, it was not unexpected. We were asked if we would mind sitting at the \"sushi bar\" (literally a small counter facing a wooden wall), since there \"SEEMED\" to be no other tables be available. We waited for almost 15 minutes before asking to be moved since no one had come over to take our order. One of the hostesses said it would be an hour wait despite the fact that their were tables being cleared and no one waiting to be seated. We even asked to sit at the Tiki Bar but were told they did not serve food on that side of the restaurant. Once we were finally seated at another table, our waitress quickly came and put in out order for drinks and food. She was very pleasant but could clearly tell that we were not happy with the way we had been treated thus far. We waiting over 30 minutes as sushi was run over to the Tiki Bar and served to customers who were seated after us. We finally asked our waitress to speak to the manager because we genuinely believed that we were being refused service. The manager, Kyle, then approached us on the defensive with a LOT of attitude. He rudely countered our complaints by pointing out that the menu clearly asks to allow time for the artful food to be created and even tried to blame our waitress for the bad service we were receiving. I understand that running a restaurant can be tedious, but it does not mean that your treat your customers with anything but kindness and a smile. He  offered to comp our drinks as the food would be out soon, but we were tried of waiting and being treated poorly; we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. As we were leaving, the table next to us also asked to speak to the manager as they had been waiting over 45 minutes for their food.  If you really want decent sushi in Sewickley, I recommend the China Palace down the street who had a legitimate sushi chef and options other than a California role with garlic aoili."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time I sat outside  this time at the sushi bar. The place has a cool tiki bar atmosphere. The outside has some cool decorations and straw umbrellas. The inside is kinda modern tiki hipster vibe. Both times I ordered sushi only so I can't comment on the rest of the menu. The sushi however is freaking awesome.  Lots of roll choices and not the typical boring stuff.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I have been to the slippery mermaid now a handful of times and I have to suggest the sassy mermaid. The sauce that is used overtop the California roll creates a unique twist on the classic dish. I have on some visits had crunchies on top of the sassy mermaid, and on other visits it did not. Not sure if it is or isn't supposed to be a part of the dish, but it definitely makes it much better!"}
{"text":"There is metered parking along the street and additional parking along the side streets. Keep in mind that this place get busy during dinner time, especially in the weekends. The kitchen closes about 830pm. I will say that this is a very solid sushi place and tiki bar, but the service was slow. We waited for about 10 minutes after we sat down to be approached. Once our waitress came over, she was very nice.  The first roll we got was the dragon roll. This was very good. I love everything spicy tune and eel. 4/5  The fiesta mermaid was probably the favorite. It has a spicy taste of jalapeño salsa. 5/5  The whale of a roll was good too but nothing special. 3.5/5  The triton's tuna was our least favorite. I thought the tuna tartare was going to be better than it was. I'm also not a fan of wasabi aioli. 3/5  The flaming mermaid had an awesome garlic taste to it. This was good. 4/5  I topped it off with the pineapple mojito. The touch of ginger ale was a great addition. I wish there was more! 4/5  Will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Went to slippery mermaid in search of good sushi near Pittsburgh.  Came on a Saturday around 4pm so were seated right away. Ordered edamame for an appetizer which was good. Nothing special. Then we ordered four different rolls to share with my fiancé. The presentation was great and we enjoyed all rolls. The sushi tasted fresh and had good flavors. Would come here again if in the area but probably wouldn't make a trip just for their sushi. The town itself is cute."}
{"text":"The sushi was just okay and the service was absolutely awful. Our waitress came over to our table to get our drink/food orders and to drop off the check and those were the only two times. She didn't even refill our drinks even though they were empty, and she didn't bring our food out to us, or didn't come to check in and see how we liked everything. They weren't even busy! I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Horrible service .  we waited an hour for a table (they were busy, not a big deal) but we ordered right away & waited for OVER AN HOUR for our meal to arrive . i don't care how good your food is, over an hour for sushi rolls is insane esp when there are four people doing nothing at the front \"hostessing\" . super disappointed ."}
{"text":"After eating here multiple times I am finally writing a review because I have mixed thoughts on this place.  Sometimes I leave feeling like it's the best sushi roll place ever......and sometimes I wonder why I went?? Their rolls are mostly really good and my favorite is the Dragon Roll.  However sometimes there can be too many sauces on some of the rolls.  I absolutely love the Salmon Shashimi appetizer.  However, this place lacks in consistency both in service and food.  Sometimes the spicy tuna is really spicy, other times it is not.  Sometimes you get your food quickly, other times you do not.......regardless of how busy the place is.  Last time we went there I had an order of Tuna Nigiri and the pieces of tuna on the rice were unacceptably thin. Whoever cut them that thin should be fired.... If that was my first time there, I wouldn't go back."}
