{"text":"In my opinion, they do not understand the concept of FRESH food. I imagine the food must sit out for the better part of a day or two. I have eaten Chinese fast food from all over the city and never been as disappointed.  I tried this location last year and again this year and the meal was definitely not to my standards. I will no longer give them a chance."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried this place for a quick bite, what can I say.... Sesame Chicken is just like dipped bread with sweet lemon sauce, the noodle tastes like leftover ones, also for the daily special, they should have offered the spring rolls but they didn't bother to give, when requiring napkins the cashier was so unwilling to give. Even if I know it is just at a food court but still the food itself is far from just being ok."}
{"text":"Terrible food. They give you a juicy sample of the orange chicken then when you order they very lightly load you up with the driest piece of chicken they can find. Very pushy to buy more food and drinks. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Don't bother wasting your time or money.    This was the worst mall Chinese food I've ever had!!  Even my teenage daughter said she didn't want to finish her entree.  They were trying to pass greasy spaghetti noodles as lo mein.  The chicken and vegetables were so oily and soggy that we left behind our entrees.................in the food court's garbage can."}
{"text":"Sometimes a girl just has a rampant craving for some mean chow mein. Okay, so I'd imagine that it's not JUST girls that crave these goods, and chow mein isn't actually mean, but you get my drift.   I pretty much drove all the way across the city just so I could eat at a food court that I knew FOR SURE had a place that served chow mein. Enter Famous Wok.   I'd never been here before, and their food turned out to not only look appetizing, but it was real good. In fact, it was so good that there is nothing I would have rather had in the ENTIRE food court. The only thing that was a little frustrating was that when I went to pay with visa (cause it was listed as one of the payment options they accept), the lady working the till ended up running my card through 3 times before their machine actually worked. I was cool with waiting, but the woman was actually getting frustrated with ME! Ummm... the machine not working is *totally* not my fault.   Don't get me wrong though: Her spazziness didn't keep me from inhaling my noodles; I was just a little disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"OK... so for the first time in my life I am writing about an eatery in... a Food Court.  But wait!!!!   HOLY.. this was THE BEST Chinese food I have had since living in Calgary! We were walking by frustrated that our vehicle GPS took us to this Mall in search of something else that had been taken OUT. So, we walked by the Famous Wok and I saw the most perfect fried rice looking at me as I was eyeing it up. The free sample of the sesame chicken reeled us in and SNAP, we were in their trap. Bonus for us, it was 8:30pm and they were loading huge white take-out boxes full of all their goodies for a steal at $5.99 per box. Pays to go out late when they are closing up shop.  Included in our loaded take out box was:  BBQ pork Fried rice Amazing spicy calamari Spiced chicken wing Stir fried Chinese Veggies 1 Chinese Dumping  Are you kidding? I would eat here every night if I could. Fresh, tasty and did not make me want to drink 5 bottles of water when I was done due to salt content. I cannot say anything bad about this place. Even if the service was crummy, which it was not, I would be back again and again."}
{"text":"My husband and I normally use Yelp to aim the right one,  but we  just find Famous Wok for accident, and a really pleasant accident, the Bourbon chicken and the BBQ chicken are so delicious, and the attention was awesome. We definitely come back !"}
{"text":"Great, quick service for an affordable price. Orange chicken is freshly made and packed with flavor. Fried rice is great & not stale."}
{"text":"This reminded me of a Panda Express.  They had several selections for you to choose from and several options for plates.  You could have a bowl, 2 special or 3 special plate.  They also offered a few sides to go with your meal.  They offered Coke products for drinks along with several bottled drinks.  I had the bourbon chicken.  It was a little grisly on a couple of pieces, but over all the flavor was very good."}
{"text":"I had the orange chicken and noodles here. The food is average but the 5 stars is for the service. There was 2 Asian older ladies working there and they were so sweet. They game me samples of everything for me to decide what I wanted. They were helpful and patient. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I've been a connoisseur of this franchise for many years, typically at a different location. My first experience here in over a year was laden with disappointment. I ordered the trustworthy Szechuan chicken, but I too found that it was nothing more than bread covered in breading and tossed in some sauce. The chicken content per piece of \"chicken\" was less than 50%. Cut it open and have a look yourself... I really hope there's some quality control in place with this franchise. Don't be fooled by the sample!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm a huge fan of mall Chinese food and unhealthy deep fried chicken coated in sugary deliciousness. I've also been eating at this fine location since 2007. However, there has been a huge decrease in quality over the past year, so I'm compelled to Yelp about it!  I can't comment on the full menu, since I hate vegetables and don't eat pork. However, the staple on their menu, the sesame chicken has taken a significant nose dive. The texture leads me to believe the chicken content has been reduced to much less than 50% of each piece. When you cut a piece open, it's largely breading. The taste has also suffered as a result (obviously), and the after taste reminds me of a post-Halloween binge on crappy chocolate and candy.   Sadly, I'll have to find a new home for my post-day-from-hell indulgence."}
{"text":"Hit and miss sometimes they have great food. Avoid the sweet drippy meats. they like to laddle from the bottom of the pan and pour it over everything ruining an already bad meal"}
{"text":"This place is great! I had half and half, white rice and le mein as well as sweet and sour chicken and some other chicken which I forgot how they call it. Everything was good, sweet and tasteful. Also, I never had le mein, which was very smooth to taste. Just an overall good experience for my first visit."}
{"text":"I tried, Usually mall/outlet Asian is the better choice. Here , not so much. I got spaghetti masquerading as Lo Mein. Burned chicken with brown uckies in it, and overly breaded chicken. Really bad. I tried to find a bright spot in this meal and I guess it was the soda I got with it. Go with the Cheese steak or grilled chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I love noodles and to my dismay, the lo mein was like one reviewer stated, 'spaghetti disguised as lo-mein' tasting pretty bland. The Orange Chicken was over done and the Broccoli Chicken must have been sitting in the hot lights for a couple of days.   Sorry, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Westernized Chinese food, so it saddens me terribly to give this place two stars.  The other reviews are very complimentary, but they're also years old.  When I went there, the fried rice and mixed vegetables were ok, but the sesame chicken was limp, soggy, and relatively flavorless.  Disappointing.  :-(  Edit: Ate here a second time, and this time had their barbecue pork / char siu.  It tasted ok, but was dry and a bit tough.  Two stars still seems about right.  Edit 2: Why do I keep coming back here?!?  The third time around I had their sesame chicken.  It had very little breading and sauce, and thus tasted like... plain chicken, which is pretty much what it was.  The next time I think of coming here, I need to look it up on Yelp first..."}
{"text":"Very nice lady offered us some bourbon chicken.  Wow! It was very nice tasting, we had two orders plus two more for take away.  Im sad this is such a drive for me. Edit: after stuffing my face with these, I realized why I liked it so much.  I have been to Hong Kong and Singapore and this placed me right back there. It feels authentic, not pretentious. It reminds me of their street food, home made, yet smokey, without having been tuned down to accommodate for our numb palate."}
{"text":"Decided to give them a try. Overall I had pretty fresh chicken (orange and bourbon) and it was delicious. To me it tasted better than Panda. The Lo Mein though was bland and tasted like glorified spaghetti.  Next time I'll get the fried rice."}
{"text":"Its pretty bad when panda express is a step up. They have lower quality chicken too. Don't waste your money on them."}
{"text":"Waited almost a hour for the bourbon chicken. It never came out. So I asked the lady how much longer and and her reply was \"I don't know\". So why the he'll do you work here. The food isn't that good to wait a hour! Just go some where else. This place is the worst!"}
{"text":"I grabbed a meal here at 12:15pm, which I would think is the height of the lunch rush/hour. Nothing was fresh. It all tasted like it had been sitting for an hour or more.  The ginger beef was soggy. The Shanghai noodles had a weird metallic taste. The chicken balls were rock hard on the outside and doughy in the middle.  On the positive side, the staff were friendly and pleasant."}
