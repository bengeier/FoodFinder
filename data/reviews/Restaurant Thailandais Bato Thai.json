{"text":"Bato Thai serves some of the most delicious Thai dishes I've ever tasted.  We ordered a red curry shrimp plate, pad thai, a vegetable dish and some appys.  The flavours of everything we ordered complimented each other very well.  Their tofu was surprisingly sweet tasting. 
The wait staff was really accomodating.  They pulled up an extra table so we could spread out the dishes we ordered.
I'm not sure if it was the patrons or the restaurant, but the atmosphere was very social.  The couple beside us struck up a conversation about the Mutek festival which is playing this week in Montreal.  
We enjoyed eating at Bato Thai and we'd definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"This place was great. Food was good and for a good price and you can byob without a corkage fee. Severs seemed much nicer than any others I've met in this city so far! Walked right in and was served my food with 10 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"Delicious food, if you can get it.

Three of us ordered one dish each.  80 minutes later one of us was served. 10 minutes later the second of us as served.  After 120 minutes, the third person had still not been served.

We gave up and tried to pay.  That  took 15 minutes  (They had lost our check).  While paying, we were told that the third dish was finally ready, as if we would go back to the table and wait for the poor third diner in our group to eat.

When the person at the cash register noticed that I had I tipped 1%, he pointed it out and said that I must of made a mistake.  I had to explain that either the server or the kitchen (I don't really care which!) had made a mistake and that no service = no tip.  CASE CLOSED!

[Actually, I think 1% sends a more effective message than no tip because they know you didn't accidentally forget.]"}
{"text":"Me to my boyfriend after I went to the bathroom \"Hey. There are naked people on the bathroom doors. This place seems to be confused. Maybe they give happy endings back there as dessert\"

This was a really weird place. Odd decor...which seems to be a running trend at the ethnic restaurants in Montreal but they offered huge portions. 

I started with the green papaya salad which was killer. Sliced shrimp and tons of salty, tangy and sweet sauce(maybe from the bathroom?). Mmmm. The bf ordered a dry martini...which they confused with a lychee martini. How you confuse those when ordering with the \"point and order\" technique in beyond me. It was good non the less.

I got a plate of fresh squid with ginger and a shit ton of veggies. They raided a garden. My bf got a huge plate of pad thai. It did not taste like normal pad thai. It had such a deep flavor. I was very very impressed. Again, another great, cheap dinner.  Who cares if the bathrooms have naked people on them or tiny pieces of artwork on huge walls. Ill still come back begging for their food."}
