{"text":"Great BBQ, check out the prime rib special on Tuesday & Thursday!!  Staff is very friendly and the beer is always COLD..."}
{"text":"I have only been here one time so I will have to give a second chance before adjusting the rating. I am a KCBS certified judge, so I know a little about BBQ.   I went in on a Monday night, which is their rib night. My first impression of the decor was that it was an old bar. The staff was friendly and prompt.   I ordered 8 ribs and a side of cole slaw and BBQ sauce on the side. The slaw was excellent. The ribs were baby backs. The tenderness and pull from the bone was perfect. I also appreciate the removal of the membrane on the back. The sauce had a great flavor too. The flavor, however, was a little lacking. There was no smoke on these ribs. I also did not care for the bark. The rub was moist and mushy, but that would have been disguised if the sauce was put on the rib.   I will have to give some of the other meats a try, but I am reluctant based on my first impression. I hope the feedback is valuable to the establishment and its customers."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night. Amy was behind the bar and Charlene was cooking. Both girls were in there 30s (or so). Commented to Charlene that she had an old lady name, who agreed and said her dad named her after his first girlfriend. Whoa!  This joint has 4 taps, of which 2 of them are out, so things started off a bit disappointing. However, they had Great Lakes Christmas Ale in a bottle. Yum yum.  They also have a TouchTunes juke box I can play from my phone which is cool, and 4 nice size flat screens.   Tuesday night special is a steak, potato and salad for $5.95. Monty had the steak and said it was very good. Amy talked me into the rib on a stick. Served in a basket, it was a slice of pork loin, seasoned, grilled and chopped up with a bbq sauce on the side. It was all good, but the bbq had a nice kick to it. Char said it was Sweat Baby Rays Original, I'm saying bull shit. It was a great sauce that may have started with SBR, but was very nicely doctored up.   Also ordered the fried mushrooms. Small basket of shrooms, but very well done. Lastly, the place has a brass pole in the lounge. Asked Amy what that was all about and all she could say was \"a guy owns the bar...\"  ROCK ON!!!!!"}
{"text":"In most cases, I can excuse the decor if the food is good. I just couldn't bring myself to eat here after walking inside. Before \"Butch\" purchased the place, it was an old dive bar. Now, it's an old dive bar with a smoker out in front. It's very dark inside, and smelling of cigarette smoke - think Super 8 Motel lobby (minus 80% of the light bulbs). After walking inside, there was one person working the bar who looked at us but never made any offer to seat us despite there being only one other patron in the place that was seated at the bar. We were there for about 60 seconds and left."}
{"text":"I must have driven past the place a billion times living in North Royalton for 5+ years. Since there aren't any great rib places around I thought I'd stop, plus the \"2 time award winner\" a frame sign made me wonder.  A smoker/grill is on display in the front, but don't let that fool you. You walk in to the dive-iest of dives. I like dives, but no this is not the kind of place I want to buy ribs from.  The 1 bartender who is serving 1 patron, pulls me out a slab from a warmer and gives me a couple sauces to-go. She was pleasant and nice, but I'd chalk the ribs up as some of the WORST. My husband said they weren't the worst but they weren't good in his book. I hated the sauce so much I had to rinse it off and put my bottle stuff on. The meat was dry and leathery, chewy, reminds me of... Alligator meat, very brittle.  Not only that but 1 slab cost 18.00. Rip off. OH and when I was in the bar picking up the ribs I looked around for the \"awards\" the only ones i saw were from a LONG time ago, I'm talking maybe the 80's. I would love to know the date of the most recent award..."}
{"text":"Excellent Fried Bologna Sandwich on Monday's. Beef, Chicken and Shrimp kabobs on Wednesday.  Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ordered ribs from here tonight for takeout. Along with coleslaw and back beans this was awesome. The ribs fall off the bone and have great flavor. The sides are just as good. Had a family event we decided to just order out for and had plenty of food and everyone left stuffed. Would definitely go to butchs again!"}
{"text":"I called this restaurant one time, asked a small question.  My first question was Is the owner there?  Some gentlemen on the phone started screaming at me with verbal abuse and degrogatory comments to me.  I only called there to ask what time they close or are they open late.  The owner I imagine was on the phone and was a complete tool and Pompous Asshole.  Don't bother coming here, I mean if you treat people on the phone like that, I could only imagine how you would talk to your guests in house or your employees!!  Bad owners, bad employees, bad business.  Go to Outback Steakhouse!!  It's better Ribs anyway!!!"}
