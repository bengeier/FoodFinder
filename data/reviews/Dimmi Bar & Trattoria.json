{"text":"I visited the place during lunch time and ordered their best pasta. I was never disappointed. Service is great and the ambiance is awesome."}
{"text":"Overall, my girlfriend and I had a great time. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. He was quite knowledgeable with the menu. However, she is quite optimistic about every restaurant we go to, I am realistic. The food was good but not great. The ambiance was ideal for a first date or a future romance. I will rate the food a 3 out of 5. It could use some improvement. Regardless, definitely a place to try. The bread took longer than I would have liked to reach the table. Please take note that I hope the next review, discusses the time from for the bread to reach the table."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Dropped by on a Friday evening with my husband.  Expected the prices to be more expensive for a Yorkville restaurant, but pretty reasonable.  Had a pizza and pasta dish that we each shared and a drink each.  Bill came to about $60.  Just to put this is perspective, my husband and I dine out often.  From chain restaurants to the nice spots around the city.  A few weeks ago we were at a Boston Pizza and we had ordered a drink each, a pizza and a pasta dish.  It was lousy and came to the same price as dinner at Dimmi.  The difference at Dimmi is that it's made fresh, the service is great, the atmosphere is comfortable.  Absolutely worth the wait if you get there and it's a little busy.  Looking forward to coming back here again!!!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing , definitely felt like a high end restaurant with how I was treated by the servers. My friend had ordered the steak and I ordered the sea bass. His meal was for sure the winner of the night and I will be coming back for that and also because the service was amazing as well ."}
{"text":"Arriving for a Friday noon lunch based on yelp recommendation, the patio filled up very quickly. Service was quick and friendly. I ordered a pizza dimmi. The pizza took a while to arrive but it was great when it arrived. It somehow manages to be thin crunchy and a hint of chewy. Clearly fresh and clearly delicious just bynlooking at it.   All the ingredients: the chicken, the spinach, the sauce, the cheese was clearly fresh and tasted accordingly.   It's a simple pizza, done very well,at a reasonable (for this neighbourhood) price with pretty great service. Will return if possible."}
{"text":"We used to come here quite a bit.  The food is ok.  We recently had 2 birthday celebrations here within weeks apart.  The last one was just Thursday night and the service was awful.   It started ok.  No one came around to ask me if I wanted anything to drink tho so I just settled with water. But when it came time to pay for the bill...the restaurant wasn't all that busy at this point.   It took 15 mins and the manager to chase down our waitress to take our cards!  After we paid, and getting ready to leave the waitress came back to our table and proceeded to tell the BIRTHDAY girl that she screwed up on the tip and we had to put more in.  Needless to say, there are far better Italian places in the city, we are crossing dimmi off of our list."}
{"text":"This is a nice romantic spot for two in Yorkville, maybe not the greatest for a larger party.  Our first time here, the owner asked us how long we would be staying in to eat. Did not like that at all, made me not want to return. However, the quality of the food was great and that's why we came back for a second and  then some.  Food: Gnocchi alla dimmi - the gnocchi has always been consistently made to perfection. It's soft, the sauce is creamy, and the filling is very fulfilling.  Diavola - this pizza tastes pretty good most of the time with sufficient amounts of topping. I'd rate it 4/5.  Pizza dimmi - this is my new favourite pizza at this restaurant. It's cooked perfectly with a lot of toppings and it tastes great with the chilli oil.  I prefer to get seating towards the back/middle. It is a little crammed but the food is always good. Waiters are attentive for the most part, but when it gets busy, everyone is all over the place."}
{"text":"Definitely going back.  I went there for the first time with a few friends and enjoyed everything: the ambiance, the service, the food, and even the prices!  I had made reservations for 7pm on a Thursday and when we got there the place was PACKED and I worried that our table reservation might be 'lost' or we would be made to wait, but nope!  A perfect table was waiting for us.  We had a great waiter (with an adorable Italian accent) but actually all the staff was very attentive, very professional and pleasant (not snooty)!  Their timing was perfect and they were almost psychic in knowing what we would want next and when.  Maybe I shouldn't be surprized but I was.  Everyone in my party loved our appetizers, main courses and desserts.  We enjoyed a very good pitcher of the pink Sangria, and finished off the night with decaf cappuccinos that were actually decaf!  The tables are close together and the place was noisy but what else would you expect on a busy night in Yorkville?  We had a great experience and never felt rushed to leave.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Love, Love, LOVE this restaurant! Always busy on Fri and Sat nights but you will never wait for a table. A nice place to hang out with a few of your friends for wine and great food. The fried calamari is amazing, MUST TRY! It's a bit pricey but hey! You're in Yorkville. Definitely recommend the Dimmi to anyone who wants some good Italian food!"}
{"text":"The black cod on special is excellent. Side salad is also great. Service is a bit on the slow side and the place is quite noisy."}
{"text":"FOOD  Ya know, pass this place all the time, smells fantastic, so finally tried it.  Well, smells better than it tastes.  I mean the food is serviceable, but I was just thinking this is really no better than Whole Foods prepped stuff.  Maybe even a bit worse.  And considering that Whole Foods is close by and uses its own stock of mostly organic ingredients, then Dimmi, well, is dim by comparison.  Typical of an established restaurant in a good location:  kitchen staff not up to snuff, no sense of ownership, and little care over quality.  That's why I love California Sandwiches (Claremont location), ya still got the founders/the originals/the nonnas/or relatives once removed running the kitchens, giving you not a watered down rendering of classic recipes, but the real (North American) deal for a greasy spoon joint.    Dimmi is touristy.  SERVICE  Not quite Jersey Shore, but still way too much zing and zang and attitude and ehhhhhhhhh whatchaydoing kinda feel.  Don't talk about your customers within earshot.  Don`t snap and hum and banter so darn much.  This isn't a diner or a hangout for kids.  Kinda ya know slightly upmarket joint in Yorkville.  I suppose people might think that it's wrong to disparage a place for being too ethnic when it is indeed what it is.    No, I just want good service:  polite, friendly, attentive, and wants us to have a good time while we're there.  I'm not here to watch you socialize at a volume above my conversation.  Guu shouts at ya, but it's gimmicky, and I bet the staff don't even want to repeat those phrases for the umpteenth.    A really good service industry professional gauges the clientele, makes minor adjustments, and does the act with bit of variation to please the crowd, the same way a speaker would adjust his speech given the audience.    Staff here is mostly young and less polished.  I hate it when inexperienced staff imitates media, does a poor, ironic, insincere imitation of a waiter at that .. \"Righhhhhhhhhhhhhht this way\" .. and struts and glances at a reflecting surface as he gets you there.  Focus on your customers.  Read your customers.  Adjust your decorum."}
{"text":"Fell in love with the mushroom risotto. I love this place and wish it was in Chicago!!"}
{"text":"Casual and affordable - a rarity for Yorkville!  The tomato salad was amazing. I had the pasta with tiger shrimp - also delicious, if not a bit too oily. Pizzas looked great too. Only negative - your main options here are pasta, pizza or sandwiches.   For some reason, the waitress seemed a little annoyed with our table. Or that was just her face. I'm not sure."}
{"text":"I often visit Dimmi's with my coworkers and love it! The ambience is amazing and the staff go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. You definitely get a high end experience at a fraction of the price. I would highly suggest if you love Italian food to visit Dimmi's you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very nice place to go for dinner. Their rigatoni ala vodka is amazing. Especially love the pancetta that they put in it. With all meals they serve bread that is always warm, a huge plus. Also, they have balsamic and good quality oils for the bread which adds a great touch. Only thing is that their restaurant is very small and fills up quite quickly, given the area that it is in. Reservations are recommended. I haven't tried any of their other items but plan to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to drop him for lunch. Penne ala vodka was great - service was fast.  Will return again."}
{"text":"Wandered in here after a concert on a cold day feeling like something substantial. I had the fettuccine with a squid ink sauce; the paste was al dente, sauce had a nice consistency and there was a nice amount of squid. My only suggestion would be to serve it with a sharper cheese than Parmesan, although seafood pastas don't really need it.   It was nice to have olive oil and balsamic on the table with the bread basket. The menu is big enough, and pricing is decent for what you get - no pretentious prices. Service is fine; an altogether comfortable place."}
{"text":"For those looking for a good date spot, this might be one of them.  The atmosphere is perfect. The food is excellent (I had the gnocci which is a dish I rarely choose off an Italian restaurant's menu but here we are). The price? Very friendly to the wallet given the area, so much so, I treated myself to a crème brûlée afterwards which was like going down on silk.   Speaking of service, it was so attentive and they didn't miss a beat, masterfully doing so as to not interrupt the conversation or be pushy -- this, I can say, is a true skill of a good server."}
{"text":"We went here as a group of 8 last week. We had a Friday night reservation at 6:30pm and no wait. The atmosphere was great and lights were dimmed midway through which added to the atmosphere. The place was lively and the service was fairly prompt.  The food looked great all around. I'd never been here before and I tried the Goat Cheese Salad antipasti and Agnolotti pasta, stuffed with pesto and roasted red peppers. The salad was bang on, but the pasta could have been less spiced and more flavourful. Several people had their famous pizza which I tried and liked, and we enjoyed a couple of bottles of Pinot Grigio.  Dinner for two came to about $100 including wine, tip, and tax. The food was great but not excellent to deserve 5 stars. I would go here again in a few months to perhaps try their summer menu. This is a great place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Delicious tilapia and steak. I was going to give it five stars but the excessive alcohol  drank may have altered my judgement. Really enjoyed my evening tho; I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came on Nuit Blanche night. Food was decent and for a Yorkville location the price is quite low, so value is there... if you do not get a waitress who simply does not care.  The food were simple dishes, but they were done well. However, the waitress had a lack of smile all night, and simply grabbed the wine/dessert menu from my hands while I was holding it and asking a question about items on said menu. Her attitude was questionable, and I wondered if she cared about her tips at all.  When the bill came, all my questions were answered. She automatically applied a 20% gratuity to our party of 4 (I thought 15-18% was standard, if it was applied automatically at all); no wonder she did not care about serving our table properly. Our party did not feel like arguing what amounts to a rather trivial sum of money, but it certainly did leave a sour taste.  If you do eat here, pray you have a better waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff.  My wife and I have our favorites and we go regularly.  Highly suggested for the night out just the two of you."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Italian, generous servings of both pasta and pizza, and it's great to find somewhere that serves Moretti.  Staff are friendly, and has a nice feel to the place - both indoor and outdoor.  It's a longer walk from Downtown, but worth it."}
{"text":"I've dined at Dimmi several times over the years, and I can't recall ever being disappointed. My favourite dish is the gnocchi in tomato sauce: melt-in-your-mouth morsels, that taste like an elderly nonna rolled them in her old-country kitchen. Others rave about the pizzas; I like them too but they are pretty comparable to other Italian restaurants in the city (Ciao, Grazie, Terroni, etc.). Dishes are generous portions and reasonably priced, considering Dimmi smack dab in the middle of ritzy-glitzy and normally expensive Yorkville. As for celebrity sightings, I've never seen any Hollywood A-listers at Dimmi, but I did see Canadian Food Network host David Rocco dining on the patio once (he's supposed to know good Italian food, so take note) and the lead actor from the \"The Listener\"."}
{"text":"Unimpressed by Dimmi's. Overrated and overpriced for what it is. Food was ok, but nothing special. The caprese salad was more spring mix than tomatoes and mozzarella. The $20 pasta with shrimp was a very small portion with all of 5 shrimp, $20 pasta vongole (clams) was bland and the bread offered was stale.  Place was noisy, with servers/bartender calling orders across the room. Ambiance was seriously lacking. We were hoping for a nice dinner out, but it was not worth the $100 check. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Pasta was good but the flavors didn't stand out in any way. I had the squid ink red wine tomato sauce pasta and enjoyed the generous amounts of calamari on my plate. You couldn't really taste the separate flavours; definitely subtle flavours. My party really liked the ambience of the place, although I could have cared less about the decor."}
{"text":"Service too slow. Antipasti are a rip off. For that price you hardly get any food. Not enough Gorgonzola cheese on the pizza yorkville. Very disappointing. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place as my partner has lunches often with clients in the Vaughan/Woodbridge area. I'm a big, big fan of Italian food but for some reason, not so much a fan of \"homey\" Italian places. You know, where pizza is thick crust, the decor is cheesy and tacky, the bread basket is kind of stale, and the pasta comes in giant portions.   This place wasn't that. It was a bit tightly packed, but had a nice atmosphere. Everybody seemed to be enjoying their food and drink. Our half bottle of J. Lohr was so good -- probably made more so with the creamy gnocchi that we had and the Diavola pizza. The bread was also, I'm happy to report, not stale.   The server messed up our pizza order the first time -- it came out with chicken and too much green stuff. They quickly realized their mistake and worked hard to get our order right the second time. It didn't come out right away, because I assume they were re-making it fresh -- and it came out piping out and delicious. They were very apologetic about it -- really great service.   I often don't like gnocchi because it's just like these heavy balls of dough. Not these though, they were extremely fluffy and I could almost taste the potato. I loved the gnocchi dish and fought my partner for the last few bites.   P.S. the spicy olive oil is SOOOOO spicy and good. Would come back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was not. Unfriendly, absent servers. Once our food came out, we were on our own. Felt like we were bothering the server for the bill after sitting there forever (we tried to get their attention to order more wine and drinks, but no luck). If you do go, the pizza's are tasty though- really nice crust. The side patio was is nice to sit on, especially if you're a smoker- they don't seem to care about bylaws and were letting the table right behind us smoke (as non-smokers, not so great for us). Overall, not the best experience."}
{"text":"A coworker and I found this place when staying on Bloor and we weren't dissapointed.  I had the fusilli con pollo and my coworker veal on a bun. My pasta was cooked perfectly and both chicken and mushrooms were perfect. The place was busy for a Monday but the service was outstanding; attentive and prompt food...couldn't ask for more. Pecan chocolate pie was top notch and even the cafe americano was excellent."}
{"text":"Great food,great service.Decor is warm and inviting and the food was presented beautifully.Will definitely go back.The risotto is fantastic"}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant - great comfort food, great atmosphere, and terrific staff that knows you by name and treats you like family.  A perfect neigborhood restaurant for yorkivlle residents that don't want to deal with the attitude and trendiness of other local places"}
{"text":"i always thought this was the pricier-sit-down part of Hemmingways - they are so close together and i always walked away. It wasn't until a friend treated me to lunch that i discovered what i had been missing here all this time.   I tried the smoked salmon pizza which was fantastic! it's not your conventional pizza with lots of tomato sauce, melted cheese and toppings- not that there's anything wrong with that, of c! - but this is a pizza on its own. The thin crust was spectacular, the smoked salmon so delicious and the cheese - just the right amount.  It's my favourite place to go for not-your-average-pizza!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner at this great Italian restaurant. I ordered the rigatoni al gorgonzola pasta    topped with  mushrooms, roasted red peppers in a cream gorgonzola sauce. All these ingredients go so well together making it an amazing dish. The pasta was perfectly cooked, not mushy at all and more on the al dente side. The dish was well plated and the portions are good size. I also like their customer service.  All the waiters were quite pleasant and our food arrived fairly quickly. This restaurant also offers  a great patio. We sat at the table on the patio facing the side street, which is a great option, because it's more private and less crowded. An overall great experience and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"the pasta is good?but the mussels are small, maybe next time we can try the meatball."}
{"text":"Spontaneously walked into Dimmi Bar & Trattoria tonight for dinner with my friend around 6-6:30ish. Maybe its long weekend, but the restaurant inside was half full yet the patio was full. From the outside it looks more of a bar. From the inside its a nice small warm Italian garden feel. A casual atmosphere. Prices are pretty reasonable.  Bread was provided, not so fresh. Maybe its been out too long. A little dry. I ordered Risotto Shrimp and asparagus. It was pretty good. Portions was pretty generous. I wish the risotto had more herbs because all i can taste was the butter. The risotto was al dente. thumbs up for that!  For not being that busy inside. I felt rushed out with the bill after we completed our meal."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  Good value and good atmosphere right in the heart of Yorkville. I've been here many times and will keep returning.   I've been there many times in the summer and winter - either are good - but obviously no patio in the winter :)"}
{"text":"Long story short, the food's ok. Penne with spice tomato sauce was shaped like penne and the sauce was red and spicy. My friend had a pizza and we split the calamari.   Let's get to the exciting part. The service is terrible. There was an NYTimes article a few years back about the 100 elements of good dining service. (Sounds like a lot but most of them were just downright basic.) Here's one the staff should drill into their heads: if there is 3/4 of a pizza infront of one person and half a bowl of penne in front of another, we are indeed still working on it no matter how many times you ask. I would never raise my voice at staff...unless I was asked if I was finished for the 8th time, in 10 minutes. But why did it take a second request to get some damn cranberry juice on the table?   There wasn't even a line up and plenty of empty tables. What gives you guys?   This is a pass."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate an anniversary with my boyfriend. We had made a reservation for 8pm. They were incredibly rude to us the entire time, rushing us throughout, and the food was good, but not great. I've had so much better for the same price or less. I would rather go to Ciao Wine Bar in the area.  The service and timing was awful: The food came out in fewer than 10 minutes from ordering , I can't imagine it was made fresh at that speed. We were still eating the bread. We had to ask over 5 times for water refills. The waiter asked us what we wanted for dessert numerous times, annoying us each time even though we politely explained that we needed some time to think and read it each time. We felt so rushed the entire time, and the bill was brought to us (without asking first if we were ready for it) within 2 minutes of finishing our dessert. The waiter was in such a rush and had such a lack of tact that he basically tossed the bill on our table without saying a word. We had been there for less than an hour and he was pushing us out! We couldn't believe how rude he was.  I felt extremely uncomfortable.  Food: Our pasta mains were very fresh, but the flavours were just okay. I've had better elsewhere. The dessert (apple crumble with ice cream) was excellent and made up for the mediocre mains.  Ambiance: Very dark, crowded, loud, uncomfortable.  All in all, there are MUCH better places to go for Italian food in Yorkville and downtown."}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place has such high reviews! The service was perfectly fine but I found the food quite lacklustre. The pastas that my friend and I ordered were very mediocre, with sauce that seemed straight out of can with no herbs or spices. The bread was also quite bad.  It basically tasted like a more expensive version of East Side Mario's. I won't be back."}
{"text":"On my way from work I always pass by this nice italian trattoria and my favourite thing is the chicken foccaccia.  It's not made with foccaccia bread but pizza dough and still very good.  There is a real italian authenticity to this place.  The red wine is always flowing the italian waiters are always flirting, and the espresso is served to perfection as if you were somewhere in naples or Rome.  Great place to hang out in the summer on the patio with a friend and just people watch."}
{"text":"Great location and service. A little on the pricier side but excellent food, especially the pastas"}
{"text":"The pizza and caprese salad is amazing. I will definitely come back for the food and great service. Samantha served us on two separate occasion and was always knowledgeable, happy, and polite."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and thought I was in for a good time as many people I know have been here.  Service was fairly slow and inattentive.  Ordered the antipasto platter with cold cuts, diced cheese and some fried clams to. Nothing to write home about . It came with this weird ketchup like sauce that was totally out of place.  Next was the chicken spinach pizza . Somehow had almost no flavour. From the chicken , spinach and the tomato sauce , nothing stood out about it. People around me ordered pasta and it looked pretty good but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back again"}
{"text":"Booked this restaurant for my Mothers Birthday and couldn't have asked for a better night out! The Decor was a lovely tasteful mix of modern yet old world Italian.The staff were exceptional meeting our every need and it was obvious the staff really enjoyed working here! The food was delicious and probably the best homemade pasta I have ever eaten! Very reasonable considering the area, service and quality of food  The location was excellent and I will definitely recommend to all my friends and family, Coming back really soon"}
{"text":"Beautiful place to sit and drink wine while eating great italian food. I love that my waiter spoke italian!"}
{"text":"Fabulous meal, lil' lacking in the experience department. It was one of those cases when the server has you pegged as a student-poor-not-going-to-tip-no-matter-what  person before you've even made it to the table. The scoffing continued when we didn't order drinks but perhaps we redeemed ourselves with appetizers?   The caprese salad was fresh and tasty. Some freshly ground pepper over the top was a nice touch but no olives for me. For a main I got the orcchiette alla primivera, ear pasta with rose sauce, sun dried tomatoes, peas and mushrooms. Right away we got some parmesan (not fresh, still welcome) and freshly ground pepper. The pasta was perfection! Al dente with everything cooked perfectly and it made for quite the treat. Orchiette might just be my new favourite pasta shape.   The uninterested server got us our bills and off we went. All in all, great food but maybe I need to wait a few years to return."}
{"text":"Still deciding how I felt about it.  Making a reservation for a large group was pretty easy.  The service was just okay. Food was good. I liked the wine. My only complaint is that it was pretty dark. Probably a better place for intimate get togethers with a special someone."}
{"text":"I am disappointed by Toronto YELPers!   We came here for a week, and wanted to eat Italian in Yorkville, ended up here, due to strong 4stars. It is a fast food place, almost, very crowded, strange mix of audience, from people in shorts to over dressed (normally, this is something good, but this was just weird). The food was far from Italian of any kind: salad was dead on my plate (this is saint to Italians, insalata mista must be fresh!), and pasta was not much better like anywhere else in North America, even diners - totally non-Italian in every possible way. I would give it one star, if it were not to respect cultural differences (with Torontonias, who I hope have saved 4stars for something more Italian than this) - this \"Italian\" is maybe from 1950, not how Italian food looks like in this century! Sorry, Dimmi, but you were my worst bet in Toronto (and expensive it was also, yes)."}
{"text":"A simple Italian meal in the heart of Yorkville.  Good service and the food is reasonably priced considering the neighborhood!  Conveniently located right under Hemingway's, this venue is cozy with traditional decor, wood panels, and dim lighting.  If you are able to get a table on the patio in the laneway, it's great for people watching!  We shared the fried calamari which was crispy, light, and perfectly cooked and served with tasty dipping sauce.  I ordered the pizza bianco which was brushed with olive oil and topped with prosciutto.  I wish I had ordered something with sauce, it was tasty, but quite dry.  My friend had the dimmi pizza, thin crust with chicken, spinach and mozzarella.  It was good ... and it had sauce!  I really liked the homemade sangria I ordered.  You can have it red, white, or pink.  I like almost everything pink and it turned out to be a good choice.  They have Italian sandwiches here too, I may have to come back for lunch."}
{"text":"Dimmi's has existed in Yorkville for 18 years and is a remembrance of times past.  The restaurant is closing down for a month or so in January to under go a complete refurbishment and redesign.  It should look fabulous, but get there before the closing to enjoy the kind of dining sadly missing from the majority of Yorkville establishments.    This is a bar and trattoria that welcomes you with open arms and hugs you with delicious, well priced food.  It reminds me of the restaurants scattered through the hill towns of Italy where you feel you have been invited into someone's home.  Raymond, the charming owner and manager, is always there, welcoming you, seating you, suggesting dishes, whisking away empty plates, answering the phone; a whirling dervish making sure everyone is happy.  He obviously loves what he does.  The rest of the staff emulates their leader, working hard, but with that warmth which is an integral part of Dimmi's.    The food is delicious.  This is not precious dining.  Everything is hearty, filling and satisfying.  Appetizers from the ubiquitous Caprese Salad to the grilled octopus are great.  Pastas are cooked al dente, with home made sauces and all are bread dipping good.  Dimmi's offers a variety of thin crust pizzas and they are perfect for take out.  Prices are unbelievably reasonable for chic Yorkville.  While other Yorkville dining locations greet you with their noses ten feet in the air and leave you with a check costing hundreds of dollars, Dimmi's envelops you in warmth and leaves you with a smile on your face."}
{"text":"A little hard to find the entrance but it was hell worth it.  Great atmosphere, people, service, wine...not so much on the food but I'm willing to overlook it.  The staff were extremely accommodating of the party of 15 I organized.  Timing of food was spot on, the server always seem to come at the exact time anyone needed anything and was not overbearing.  The manager made sure we were WELL looked after and the personal touch just made my night.  Slightly pricey but definitely bang-on.  Hell, they are located in Yorkville, rent is NOT cheap."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in such an adorable area! Perfect place for a date!!!  We got the Margarita and Calabrese pizza. Both were amazing and perfect size to be shared by two people.   For dessert we got creme Brûlée - really good!  The service was beyond exceptional. Efficient and food was delivered very quickly.   I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I like this place! Affordable prices for fair Italian dishes. We started with the ricotta salad which was divine, I would probably return just to order the salad as my main! The rigatoni a la vodka was delicious and not too heavy at all, and the seafood pasta dish was great too. Service was friendly, I was afraid to come in after reading reviews about rushed service since we were looking for a more relaxed dinner but it went great!  Only reason I'm docking a star is because we had buffala cheese served to us when we had ordered the $22 burrata. I'm no cheese connoisseur, but I can tell those two apart. It was brought back without hesitation and the kitchen immediately confirmed my suspicions about having buffala served instead of burrata. While they mentioned it was a mistake It concerns me that I had seen a table next to us receive the same exact plate...with buffala cheese. Maybe that's what they ordered? Not sure what was really happening, but maybe opt out of trying burrata for the first time here!  Other than that, I would return."}
{"text":"great place.  just came by here for lunch and was very happy with the pick. a nice location - with exceptional service. they answered all questions I had and even verified when unsure.  I had pasta with Italian sausage, my friend had a chicken wrap and we shared a calamari dish and the Nutella cheesecake.  we were here for a bit, never got pressured to hurry up. I believe the owner was there as well - very kind, even sent us dessert shots on the house.   the ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because we were constantly swatting the black flies away."}
{"text":"A good spot for pasta, but not a whole lot else.  The Yorkville area has a very euro feel to it with clubs, restaurants and trendy shops all lining the streets and alleys.  Dimmi was short on atmosphere and had rushed service.  But the food was a good value and very tasty...so if you're looking to fill up the stomach before slamming vodka-red bulls all night, try this place out.  If you want a quiet dinner with a unique atmosphere, skip it."}
{"text":"Sorry folks, although my first visit won 5 whole stars (and a ROTD), I have to rejig my review. Although the food was still very tasty, my last visit to Dimmi was very disappointing. We had horrible service - slow, inattentive, and our server was VERY abrupt. Almost violent in the way he put glasses and plates on the table. It took a full 25 minutes before someone even took our drink order, and at the time we said we were ready to order... and 15 minutes later our drinks arrived and we were able to place our order. Same sequence of events when we were looking to get our bill. Sorry Dimmi, very poor customer service this time around."}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered this place on a visit to TO in 2005, and we loved it so much that we made sure to come back on our next visit in 2011. It's just as good as we remembered. Highlights: - Excellent service: we were greeted right away, everyone was very friendly, and multiple servers checked in frequently to make sure everything was okay. - Fantastic food: my wife and I split a goat-cheese salad and gluten-free spaghetti & meatballs, and the quality was excellent. Same for the cocktails, although their web site lists more martinis than are included on their actual menus. The barkeep had no trouble keeping up, though. - As others have mentioned, this is a great neighborhood for people-watching. Lots of hotties, and we even saw Colm Meaney out with his wife and baby the last time we were there. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I was actually pretty impressed with the pasta quality at Dimmi. Also the atmosphere is really nice, It's great to have a date here.  The pasta is cooked perfectly al dente. The price is also really good considering it is in the Yorkville area.  Make sure you make a reservation or at least call ahead to see if they have a table available. This restaurant fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great q chocolate pecan pie and sticky toffee pudding.  It has an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night and the place was fairly busy to my surprise.   Pros: - authentic Italian ambiance  - pastas were a hit or miss. Mine was great while my girlfriends was pretty tasteless   Cons: Pricey for the quantity offered."}
{"text":"I feel like Dimmi needs a bit of a modern facelift, though maybe the old Italian atmosphere is what some patrons enjoy. Their menu is slightly uninspiring but maybe don't fix what isn't broken, as their red sauce is particularly great on any type of pasta, and I seem to keep going back."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a fellow Yelper and I couldn't be happier to have taken the advice. We arrived a bit early for our reservations so we sat at the bar and had a pint. The bar is located right inside the door but you don't feel like its too over crowded.   Once inside, its quite the gem. The wait staff were brilliant, the food was very well made. We had the Calamari to start and then I had the Gnocchi while my BF had the Pasta with Sausage. We were both very satisfied! My only complaint would be that the wine menu didn't offer a whole heck of alot.   The prices were beyond a bargain. I highly recommend this place for date night or for a social gathering. Its worth it!"}
{"text":"I took the Romanof pastas (vodka) and my son the Arabiata.  They were both ok, but the portions fell short of the asking prices. Same with the wine I got by the glass... 1/4 of the glass, that's ridiculous.    You can get more bang for the buck elsewhere."}
{"text":"Prime real estate in Yorkville for years, the duo of Raymond Commisso and Leslie Chan have broadened their horizons, and our options, by opening in the most coveted spot of Market Lane in Woodbridge. The same menu of fresh al dente pasta like angel hair spagheti al pomodoro and basilico, and tagliollini with black tiger shrimps, arugula, and cherry tomatoes, is irresistible. Charbroiled or cornmeal encrusted calamari; humoungous calzone; lightly breaded lamb chops stuffed with prosciutto, spinach and mozzarella-we've enjoyed them all again and again. The pasta sauce is rich and tangy, and pasta is also served whole wheat or gluten free. A relaxed patio with refreshing cocktails and a sociable vibe; it's easy to linger here well into the evening."}
{"text":"It's bad enough for me to go there alone, I often hate finding myself wanting to go to a restaurant without no-one to go with me there.   But I digress, I was lucky earlier (around 6) that the restaurant was somewhat empty although I find it uncomfortable that the waitress asked me to sit right next to two girls. Anyways I often don't mind how long when they deliver the food but when I ordered the Rigatoni Al Gorgonzola, it tasted somewhat foul; after eating it I thought that they had mixed up the order due to having seafood in it and the seafood tastes watery and bitter.   I wasn't in the mood to return it but the seafood underneath the pasta had ruin my appetite and the sauce that compliment the pasta well. I also ordered Calvados & Vanilla Crème Brulee which had redeemed that foul taste even though the shell of the Brulee was hard to get into but the creme inside is really delicious.   For the service, lets just say that it's somewhat similar to a Milestone or any other chain restaurant. The waitress was nice and wasn't really annoying but it took me awhile to figure out that they have specials there and the fact that the waitress didn't tell me anything about the fricken specials while the people sitting next to me was immediately told of their special (pasta/meat).  Besides that it was quite depressing when they lid a candle on my table, don't get me wrong, its romantic but man way to call me a loser...."}
{"text":"I came with my wife for lunch on Sunday after reading reviews on yelp. This is the worst place I've been in years, the server was really rude to us, the pasta was nothing great and everything was overpriced....keep away from this place and if not, write a review telling me I was right."}
{"text":"The food is fine. We concerned about the environment a lot. There is some bug crawling on the wall when we were eating. Felt disgusting."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, and the prices are very reasonable given the quality.  Three of us went for lunch and ordered the gnocchi, the agnolotti (with a pesto and sundried tomato filling), and a pizza with gorgonzola cheese, roasted red peppers, fresh figs and honey.  Everything was incredible.  The options for a vegetarian here are extensive (without having to ask for substitutions).  The place was pretty busy for a weekday lunch, and we had a reservation, but I don't think there would have been a long wait if we'd just shown up."}
{"text":"Yum!  The food wasn't much to look at, but the flavour was delicious and ingredient quality is obvious once they hit your tongue.  I had the fettucine alla rivera which came with shrimp, mussels, clams and calamari in a tomato based sauce.  When it arrived, it looked a bit overcooked or that it's been sitting for too long.  However, I was proven wrong when I actually started eating it.  Ordered a cappuccino as well for after and that came out tasty as well.  Came here on a sunny weekday for lunch.  The patio was already packed when I got there.  Good thing for reservations and early arrivals!  The service was very friendly and the food came quickly.  When it was time to leave, I guess it was too busy as it took a while to get the cheque.  A good mid-priced place in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Dimmi's is great casual place to eat. The food is authentic Italian, and the service is great. The pasta is fresh. I enjoy coming here. The ambiance is also very nice with the outside patio. Nice wine selection. They always have great specials. I normally avoid spaghetti in restaurants, but Dimmi's the exception, cooked to perfection \"al Dante\" the sauce is fine, and the meatballs supreme.  Give it a try! Well done Dimmi's."}
{"text":"A reasonably priced restaurant with decent foods in yorkville area. I think it sums up Dimmi pretty well. No surprise yet no disappointment. The only small down is the Cumberland pizza recommended by our waitress was so average that my group agreed it was not yummy at all with starving our stomach... i ordered the rigaton ia la vodka. Not bad, yet not amazing, nice sauce but the i could see the generous amount of oil floating on the dish lol my friends got fussili con pollo which was pretty good and the seafood fettuccine, which was again, not bad but probably other places could make it better. No lineup during lunch hour so at least we didn't need to watch people eating while waiting for table. Will I come back? Yes if I forgot to make a reservation to restaurant on my list during lunch hour AGAIN LOL"}
{"text":"Place is great... Located in swanky Yorkville on one of the most popular streets (Cumberland), I have nothing truly negative to say about Dimmi.  The food is fresh, authentic, and fast.  I ordered the mussels with tomato sauce, which came out steaming hot from the kitchen... Portion was reasonable.  The ambiance is very nice, although they could invest in some more lighting.  Our server was straight from Italy, which gave the restaurant a great added touch.  We met the owner during our visit, and he was very pleasant.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"With a great jazz band playing on the Cumberland Street stage, a beautiful June evening, and the perfect table on the Dimmi patio, what else could one ask for? Oh! The food. Right. Well...  It was delicious! Both the Siciliana pizza (hard to find in Toronto) and the rigatoni a la vodka were plentiful, piping hot, and very tasty.  We ended the meal with cafe americano and tiramisu, one of the best I've had, Italy included.  Service was fast and very friendly. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience and I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Went to this place last night with my fiancée after we went to the movies just for a quick bit of dinner. We arrived around 10pm and were greeted at the door where we asked to look at the menu. The menu seemed to have a good selection of dishes at a reasonable price so we decided to get a table.   We sat down and were brought bread and water and I ordered a Negroni, which was good but it said on the menu would come with an orange wedge and it came with a cherry. I'm not complaining though, it's a 3oz cocktail for $10!! We ordered our food which came within about 10mins. The food quality wasn't the best, my fiancée had the meatballs which she said \"lacked in flavour\" and I had the penne with goat cheese and spinach which was very average and not seasoned very well.  We probably would have had another drink but the food came out so quick that it wasn't worth it. However, the service was good and all of the staff were friendly. I want to try more things on the menu so I will be back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at DIMMI restaurant! Great waitresses and cooks! Perfect amount of food for the cost! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The vibe and food in this place is excellent. Friendly service and cosy restaurant space. Be aware that the water the waiter offers is NOT FREE but $8/bottle. Unknowingly, we kept ordering more water and then the bill came!! AHHH!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. This place is deceivingly big. It has two patios. The staff weren't the friendliest bunch, but the food came out hot and quick and I never had to ask for refills (even on the bread basket).  I ordered a seafood pasta. The portion wasn't the biggest I've ever had, but there was quite a bit of seafood. The sauce was whatevs but the pasta was fresh and apparently made in house. The prices were surprisingly reasonable given the area. If I lived in the area, I'd probably be back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in this city, the food never disappoints! This restaurant has amazing food and great service. I've come here many times and refer all my friends to it. Run like a family restaurant, the food is always great, fresh and reasonably priced. Love coming back and I definitely suggest getting the calamari!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Dimmi! As previously noted, it's a tasty, reasonable option for Yorkville. Great date, BFF-hang or business-lunch spot.  I've been here approximately one trillion times and I have it down to a science: go with a friend so you won't have to decide between pizza and pasta, and get both. Or two pizzas, one red and one white. Done-zo.  My go-to selections: - Rigatoni al Gorgonzola (mushrooms, roasted red peppers, cream sauce) - Pizza Salmone (smoked salmon, arugula, red onions, capers, cream cheese) - Pizza Gorgonzola (gorgonzola cheese, red peppers, olive oil, figs, honey) - Gnocchi alla Dimmi (rose sauce, asiago) - Tagliollini alla Gamberi (black tiger shrimps, arugula, cherry tomatoes)  Both of the gorgonzola dishes are delicious and rich but your stomach will magically find room for it.  The quality of service varies. They ding you with a charge if you split a plate over drinks, sometimes aren't the friendliest, and occasionally snatch the bread away before you're done with it.* Once I did have an awesome waiter, who presented us with a big thing of COTTON CANDY at the end of our meal and totally made my night. Sadly, the service hasn't been as great since, despite multiple visits. Love me, Dimmi! I want to love you.  *I'm never done with it."}
{"text":"Very nice place and cool ambience. Their food menu is well rich and the wine/coktaols are good."}
{"text":"The Pasta and Pizza here is excellent. One of the few restaurants in the area that is more reasonably priced, the portions were not that small - it was perfect median between full and hungry.   It was crowded on a Friday night. 7pm and we had to wait a bit for a table even though we had a reservation.   The problem was that there was no where to stand and we were a big group tight in the entrance blocking the way for everyone.   Its crowded and narrow inside and I was constantly bumped into by patrons and waiters even as I was sitting.  Food came prompty, pasta cooked perfectly al dente and bursting with flavour. The pizzas thin and crispy on the bottom.  I would skip the dessert. Got the creme brulee but nothing special and quite telling when they bring it out almost minutes after you ordered it, cold.   The place is super dark and dim. I'm suprised the servers don't trip as they run back and forth.  Understood that they have a high turnover, but like the last time I came. We were shuffled out of there right after we paid the bill. But they were really rude about it.  When I made the reservation, they said we had the table until 9pm. At before 830 they came to us and asked us to leave (after we paid). I mean, we were already planning to was besides the point.but we had just given the card machine back !  I said, \"we actually have until 9) . And the manager says back to me \"I tod you on the phone you had the table until a certain time\" . I said yes, and it was 9pm!  Just find it rude. For this may not come back. I don't need someone to tell me one thing and not keep their word."}
{"text":"Let me just cut to the chase . Service was POOR. They wouldn't let us ( a couple) sit at a table that had more room when we asked kindly as we saw other couples at bigger tables!   The food was NOT the same as before at all! Pizza Pizza tastes 100x better than what we had there. The pizza was dry, didn't even look or taste fresh. They were cheap with the toppings! The complimentary bread was tasteless even the pigeons outside wouldn't touch that once.   The manger ( I believe he was the manager) asked me to MOVE into a different chair in the MIDDLE OF MY Meal with my bf. what a JOKE!! He should have either sat the new party somewhere else as there was PLENTY OF ROOM or given us a better table as we asked earlier before we got seated. Don't know why he was so ruthless to make a patron MOVE in the middle of their dinner.   I would give this place 0 stars if I could. Save yourself the hassle and take yourself next door to Hemmingways where BOTH the food and service are better!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday night so it was nice to see a place still taking reservations. The atmosphere was nice and staff were friendly. Our waiter had quite a few tables so we got most of our attention from the busboy who left something to be desired but overall they were very friendly and better than most other places in Yorkville. It was busy and everyone seemed to be having a good time, more a bustling crowd than a quiet romantic italian place (which I thought it was going to be but it didn't matter).  The dress was mixed, when I walked in there was someone sitting up front with their ball cap on (crooked, of course) and some folks at the back were a little more dressed up and everything in between so it seems anything flies here. You can stop in after work, on your way out for a nice evening or in your jeans.  We both got Pizzas and they were good but very short on sauce and cheese. I'm sure this is their style of pizza making but it really needed some sauce.   Two glasses of wine, a Cesar, two salads and two pizzas was about $80 plus tip. The salads we got to start were a little steep considering what they were, but the Pizzas were priced well. The \"glasses\" of wine are more like 3/4 glasses, I doubt my first one even had a full 5oz.   Overall it was a decent place, I think I'd eat here again for a nice lunch on a Saturday or Sunday.  Again, some of the better waitstaff in Yorkville, much more friendly than most."}
{"text":"Good place for a casual meal in Yorkville. If you're in a hurry, it may be worthwhile to mention to your server if they can speed up your orders. Since we weren't in a rush, we enjoyed our experience.  Food was good, and I was particularly pleased with the clam and seafood pasta. The wait staff are quite attentive, but appeared rush most of the time. They have a private room which would be quite convenient for larger parties."}
{"text":"I am writing this review solely for the grilled calamari on a bed of fresh lightly seasoned salad greens. I was thinking and still am thinking about this dish for days. I can still remember my first cut and slice into that soft tender moist squid meat that had just the right amount of bounce and texture that still makes my mouth salivate.  Just thinking about how the chef would season it like the \"Salt Bae Salt Man\" but the seasoning would be just perfect.  The right hint of salt.  I do hope they use a nice good quality sea-salt or himalayan or kosher salt.  I just imagined they did.  Everything else was a memory that was good, but overshadowed by the squid dish.  My colleagues like the deep fried calamari, but for me, it's all about the grilled version.  Staff were polite and attentive.  Food came out fresh and as for me, the salads were all top notch.  I really want to come back again for the squid and another type of pizza.  Thanks to Rino for recommending this place.  It has truly inspired me to look for a place in Vancouver that will get me to the satisfaction of this dish that I had served here.  OMG. I'm still thinking about it for breakfast on the other side of the country like a long distant relationship you can't stop thinking about.  My heart and palette still yearns..  Typos free of charge with every review I attempt.  Not inclusive to blogs and vlogs, but rather keep it light and airy.  That is me at my attempts to Yelp it refreshingly inspired."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant that is welcoming. We went for lunch with our two kids (3 and 10 months). They accommodated us and service was fantastic. Food is superb. I'm partial to the margarita pizza. The gnocchi is great too. Definitely our go to restaurant in that area.  Highly recommend it for friends, families, date nights. Anything really.  It's awesome!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice and the  service was great.  Servers were very friendly.  The food was delicious. The price was reasonable. The restaurant was very cozy. Close to home we didn't need the car to drive there."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and was pretty impressed!  Good prices and good food.  I had the mushroom risotto which was divine.  Two of the folks dining with us had the pesto risotto (was a special for the day) and they loved it (I thought it was kinda strong on the pesto, but they told me I was nuts).  One of us had the pizza and he said it was delicious."}
{"text":"love it .  5 starts all the way!  always feel like im at home"}
{"text":"Great location in a great part of town (Yorkville), friendly staff and decent decor DO NOT make up for fairly low quality food. I ordered the Pizza Diavalo and the meat was gristly and lacked flavour (or spice), the sauce on the pizza tasted like it was from a can (very very sugary). The crust and cheese were very good. The people I dined with were also not impressed. The food wasn't terrible, it just wasn't great, it was very mediocre. If not for the location, I do not believe it would still be around, or it would have been forced to improve by now."}
{"text":"My wife and I were turned away by everyone else in the area but the very friendly staff at Dinni welcomed us in and sat us in a very packed restaurant. The service was impeccable. And the food was even better. The pizza was perfect and the gnocchi was delicious.  Very highly recommend!  The staff was amazing!!"}
{"text":"It's a girls night out and we decided to try Dimmi.  Food was good overall, but we felt that the whole night, the waitress and waiter were rushing us to finish the meal.  They would start picking up our bread plates with olive oil and vinegar even when we were still eating our bread.  Same when we were finishing pizza and the plate was already taken away.  Also, the server never came during the dinner to ask how our food was.   For a place on Yorkville, we would have expected better service."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy atmosphere! The white sangria was SOOOOO delicious!!~ We got a pitcher of it and it was filled with so many fruits (apples, grapes, strawberries .. ) and it was perfectly sweet  Ordered my fave fig pizza dish! It was very comparable to my favourite fig pizza from il Fornello. The pizza at this restaurant was covered with cheese and perfect amount of fig /honey sweetness!  Pasta (plain spaghetti and meatball) was ok too.   Ordered a tiramisu as well! Pretty good size and quite yummy."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Love the atmosphere. Always feel like family. Les and raymo the owners are great to all the clients that come in."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I find thats it is one of the more moderately prices restaurants in Yorkville. Really nice patio seating and restaurant decor. I ordered a mojito and the goat cheese salad with spinach and grilled chicken. Nothing too heavy. It was a great portion size and wasn't too heavy either. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a \"cheaper\" restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"To be very honest, I did not enjoy my experience here. I came here with my girlfriends for a birthday dinner celebration. This restaurant was in a very convenient location to get to in the heart of Yorkville. Walking into the restaurant is was nicely decorated and very comfortable environment.   Our server was nice, but I have to say I keep getting the feel of being rushed. Rushed to order, rushed to give her feedback on how our food was, even though we haven't tasted our food yet. What I mean here was that our food came, and literally within a few minutes our server came to ask us how was our food. We looked at her and said, we haven't even started eating yet. There is eager and there is her .... Half way though our time at the restaurant, we couldn't even locate our server. Apparently, our server had gone home and we found that out when we were ready to ask for our bills. We waved down a server to ask for our bills and we told the server that we wanted split bills. We were met with a very rude response from the server that he didn't know what we ordered, our server has gone home. He then walked off and printed our bills onto one and placed it on our table. He didn't wait for us to tell him what we ordered to facilitate the split bills. I had to take our bill and manually calculate our bills. To be very honest, it wasn't the fact that I had to calculate our bills that pissed me off - it was the way in which the guy talked to us and the irresponsible way our original server just left.   In regards to the food, I find the Italian food here was just average. I ordered one of the pizzas. I think out of the whole menu, price wise, the pizza is worth what they charge. The pastas, over priced for what you get and the portion was tiny even for me and I am not a big eater. One of my friends ordered the daily soup and she wasn't too please with it - too salty. She didn't even eat half of it.   Overall, very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I really tried to like Dimmi's, I event went back after having a terrible experience. I went there on a date. I got chicken caesar salad which was drenched in dressing and looked like it was made a week ago. The waiter did not wait for my date to finish their meal and took the plate, it felt like the waiter just really didn't want to be there and was trying to get rid of us. The last time I went it was a group of four girls. We were seated at a crammed patio and got our drink order fairly fast. Then there was a huge misunderstanding with my friend's order which was server's fault because she made an assumption that my friend asked for a completely different thing (my friend clearly stated what she wanted). Our food was ok, nothing spectacular. The place is always busy which is probably mostly due to their location. I do not plan on coming back there and do not recommend it."}
{"text":"I'll be coming here more often, it's like 15 min walk away from me. Romantic place for a date ;)  I came here for dinner with my best friend, wish I wasn't sitting near the window, it was freezing but I can imagine during summer, mini patio by the window must be nice, large mirrors on the wall are handy( that sounds wrong but its good to fix your hair without having to get up haha) and the dark lighting is love. My friend Sabrina recently was in Italy and said the restaurant reminds her so much of the country from the menu items to the venue set up.   It was surprisingly cheap for a yorkville restaurant. Total bill was a bit under $60, the food was really good. One of the best pasta dishes I personally had so far.   Sabrina ordered( grabbed this from the site)  Gnocchi Alla Dimmi - In a light rose sauce topped with asiago cheese. It had a potato infused pasta taste which was good, along with glass of red wine ( wish I remembered the name because it was a really good wine when i had a taste of it and I usually don't like red at all)   I ordered, Tortellini Alla Panna - Ricotta cheese filled tortellini in a light cream sauce. I normally can't finish my pasta dishes at restaurants and leave it behind but I asked to have it to go LOL that should say something about this dish, tres yummy! I ordered a California Moscato, sweet white wine, my fave.   There was no room for dessert so we opted for coffee instead, she got double shot espresso and I had regular coffee. Spilt the bill, it was $28 each excluding tip.   I'm def coming back here, its really close by and so many more menu items I wanna try! Everyone should check it out :)"}
{"text":"This is the perfect date spot.  The food is delicious, the drinks menu is very extensive, and it's all very reasonably priced, especially given the neighborhood.  I've tried a few of the pizzas and pastas and never been disappointed. I'm not huge on seafood, but the Fettuccine Alla Riviera (seafood pasta) is the perfect combination of light, yet packed with seafood, and the Rigatoni Al Gorgonzola is rich, but not too heavy. My go-to favorite here is the Pizza Capo which has super simple ingredients, but is perfect every time. Also, and I don't think it gets enough press here, the Sticky Toffee Pudding is insane. If you're in the area and just want to get coffee and dessert, skip the wait at other cafes and bars and just split this dessert with your date (or with several people, it's pretty filling).   Having been here with groups between 2 and 10 people, and both having ordered drinks and not ordered drinks, I'd say it's a place that gives equal service to all kinds of groups -- unfortunately, this is both its merit and downfall.   The service is the only thing that drives me a little nuts during my meals here. I always feel like I'm being rushed out the door. The service is fast (=food arrives quickly, so that's good), but I feel like the server is always breathing down my neck and trying to get me out of my seat ASAP so they can turn the table. It doesn't seem as much like they're impatient as it seems like they're sort of anxious or antsy... it's very odd because the rest of the place and the ambiance really gives this warm, calm feeling. It's not at all a dealbreaker because the place is lovely, but if I had one complaint, it'd be the slightly anxious waitstaff."}
{"text":"A cute little Italian restaurant located in the heart of Yorkville (directly between Hemmingways and Amber.)   On the weekends for dinner it's probably your best bet to make a reservation, I was there at 9pm on a Saturday and it was pretty busy. Now considering the location, the prices were not bad at all.   We ordered a ton of apps and different pasta dishes. All of which were excellent (I'd recommend the Gnocchi... it was a group favourite.)  The service was great, friendly and quick. They also have a nice martini menu for post meal drinks."}
{"text":"A good place for a pizza after the museum or some shopping. Nice caprese salad with pesto.  We also ordered the Canadese pizza."}
{"text":"The clam ligunie is absolutely amazing !! Never disappointed! The place looks terrific after the renovation !!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for friends bday celebration, place is so nice.. good food.. server is friendly.. when you need him his there right away.. very polite.. calamari is so good.. tiny bit pricey for a small portion..also pasta is good.. all 10 of us enjoyed our food.. keep it up.."}
{"text":"I was pretty pumped to go here as I was celebrating my birthday. The one thing that sticks out in my mind about this place is that the prices are relatively reasonable. A table of 10 and the bill was approx. $400...not too shabby.  Okay so walking in, I wasn't very impressed by the decor. The front tables are lined up on one side and the other is a 6-person bar and then there's a wall that separates the back of the restaurant from the front...is the back for the exclusive?! This was enhanced with my party was sat in the front! I guess I'm not part of that club. There's also a large plasma TV that sits on that dividing wall...why is there a TV in an Italian restaurant?  Okay so aside from the decor let's get down to what really matters, the food and the service. More importantly, the food. I had a pasta dish with a rose sauce, I do believe it was the orechietti pasta that I had. It was delicious! I tried some of the pizza that someone else had ordered and it wasn't bad, I guess the food really does live up to it's name.   I didn't try any desserts, although I was eyeing the creme brulee when a large silver platter with a 2 tiered cake with candles came into view. My friend had snuck in a cake and was serving it. What the staff failed to mention is the little $20 fee that they charged for \"cutting\" the cake. Now I completely understand why they charge this as they are losing money by us not ordering dessert and have them serve this and cut it, but seriously...$20?! That's a lot. I could've bought a whole other cake with $20!  So the reason that there is only 4-stars instead of 5 (I originally put 3) is that the service was something left to be desired. I understand that it's the holidays and that it's busy but seriously, our server was not great. There wasn't anything specific that she did wrong per se but there was also nothing that she did that made me think she was an above par server. Got our drink orders, served drinks, got food orders, someone else served the food and then brought over the cake. Typical and standard but not service I expect, especially when there's a big party and you need to schmooze them.  All in all a great place and will definitely need to go back and try it with a smaller group and during non-holiday hours. Looking forward to trying some other pastas!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and was very pleased! We both ordered pasta dishes and the grilled octopus. The octopus was a little over cooked but absolutely delicious! Both pasta dishes came out steaming hot and cooked to perfection. I had the gluten free pasta which was likely the best I have ever had.   I would give 5 stars except our server had no idea about the wine list and instead of taking the time to ask, he served me a sickly sweet glass of wine when I specifically said that I did not like sweet at all. The servers should be educated on the wine list...it's an Italian restaurant after all.   Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday lunch. Ample parking in a small plaza square in the middle of a small downtown like area in the suburbs. The restaurant is warm, clean with very nice vintage style lighting. There are a variety of tables that can accommodate small and large parties. Our server was very friendly, accommodating and provided great service though-out the meal.  We ordered the following dishes: calamari fritti, spiced aged beef carpaccio, margherita pizza, artichoke and 4 cheese risotto, rigatoni al gorgonzola. They start you off with some nice Italian bread with balsamic and olive oil. All of the dishes were excellent. The risotto was so creamy and cooked to perfection. For me the star was the pasta. It was just so good. Perfectly cooked rigatoni swimming in a creamy Gorgonzola sauce with mushrooms and roasted red peppers. The sauce was amazing and I found myself mopping up the extra with bread. For dessert we finished up with their sticky toffee pudding. Great pudding with a smooth toffee sauce and served with their vanilla ice-cream. This was a decadent treat and I highly recommend it.  Would love to come back here in the future."}
{"text":"I have a complicated relationship with Dimmi.  I work in the neighbourhood and have eaten here numerous times.  I happened to be there earlier today and thought it's high time I write a review.  First, the restaurant is small and there is nothing special about the interior.  In the summer, there is a tiny patio that sits in the alleyway (not a real alley, but more of a path connecting Cumberland and Yorkville streets), which is prime.  It's super cozy and great for people watching.    The service is very good.  I can't recall a time where I wasn't pleased.  Tonight I was there with a really large party and the service was seamless.  They were all attentive and efficient and I seriously do not think there was one misstep.  Impressive.  The food: I don't really do pizza when pasta is on the menu, but the pizza always looks good when I see others eating it.  I always get a pasta, most often, the rigatoni a la vodka.  It is always divine, and they are so liberal with the parmesan, which I love. The problem is that the portions are very small.  Too small.  I really could eat two pasta entrees at Dimmi (but I can't, b/c that would be socially unacceptable).  Add to that that the prices are high, well, it's disappointing.  In the past, I have tried the spaghetti (good), mushroom risotto (delicious but such a tiny portion), tomato salad (delicious but way overpriced for what you get).  Today I decided to go with something different.  I tried the Stozzapreti a la Ernesto, which is described as spicy nduja sausage, rapini and cherry tomatoes in garlic and olive oil.  The pasta was overcooked, the sausage was not very tasty (and it wasn't crumbled, which is a crime) and it was in a tomato sauce.  I was expecting a garlic/olive oil, so pasta that was less \"dressed\".  I ate it anyway b/c I was not about to be the person in a party of 20 to make a complaint, in the middle of christmas party season, when the staff are just doing their best to keep things moving.    The menu itself is largely uninventive, and the prices and portions and lack of invention mean that I never order an app.  There is nothing exciting about your standard caprese, calamari, etc.  Finally, the bread is terrible.  It is dry, lacking flavour and just shameful.  This seems like a no-brainer --- serve great bread!    Like I said.  It's complicated.  The pasta is generally delicious, but the prices are a bit ridiculous.  This place could benefit from a menu and bread overhaul."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have tried in Toronto. It's so good to sometimes breakaway from the spongy, mangia-cake, Pizza Pizza-ish pizza and taste actual oven-baked, crusty pizza. I had Diavolo and my girlfriend had Cumberland, although I'd say that her pizza was more delicious and more filled with ingredients. That would be the only downside: I went for Diavolo hoping it would be spicy, but it turned out to be just regular sausage.   Nonetheless, the location is amazing, right in the heart of Yorkville and if you can catch a patio table, go for it, it will overlook Old York.  The service was also great, our orders were brought rapidly in 5-7 minutes, the table was cleaned immediately  once plates were empty and it was just generally very organized. Last, the price is also good, for a pizza and beer/wine, we paid ~30$. Will definitely return here."}
{"text":"I've been going to Dimmi for 15+ years and never had a bad meal. I've long since moved from Toronto but when I'm back in town I usually stop in while wandering Yorkville because it's so consistently good. This time around we started with the minestrone soup and the arugula salad. Both were hearty but the latter was lacking the candied fruit. No biggie. Next we enjoyed the risotto al funghi and the rigatoni al Gorgonzola with a glass of the house Malbec. Neither very inventive, but always fresh. Add to that the woodsy ambience, fun Yorkville people watching and fantasticly attentive service, and it was a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"The magic here is the margherita pizza. best pizza sauce I have ever tasted. crust was amazing and the cheese was perfect. The pastas are fantastic. One person at the table had the rigatoni and another had the orrechiette. Both awesome. We also had an appetizer platter. Not great. We order a $58 bottle of wine. It was pretty good. We also ordered the caprese and the cheese was good but the tomatoes were overripe. I say stick with the pastas and pizzas here. You cant go wrong. Steer clear of the meat and fish dishes. Didn't see a lot of people eating that and I don't think it moves a lot. I imagine they'll drop those dishes in due time when they figure out no one eats it because the pizza / pastas are so good. Good place for casual dining. Probably would not bring a business dinner here. It's too casual."}
{"text":"Went for an early after work dinner with a couple of friends. The food was very good but the service was weird.  First off, the VERY macho server asked us if we had heard the specials. We answered No and he said \"there are no specials\". I think he was joking but he couldn't tell a joke to save his life so it came out really awkward and kind of rude.  Also, I guess we didn't order enough drinks or appetizers because they were certainly in a rush to get us out of there.  Granted, it's a busy place - we were there at 5:30 on a Tuesday and it was busy - but I still didn't like feeling rushed. The food was good though. Basic salads, pastas and pizzas - a lot of options."}
{"text":"Nice warm atmosphere, great service, good food, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are visiting Toronto from Edmonton and happened to stumble upon this trendy and upbeat Italian joint after spending the afternoon at the ROM.  From the outstanding and accommodating staff to the phenomenal food this restaurant deserves a 10/10.  We both loved everything about this place and intend to be back.  Thanks to Jean-Paul and the rest if the staff at Dimmi for making us feel like we were a part of the family.  Sincerely,  Mikal and Georgia"}
{"text":"Not impressed! Maybe it is a great place for a pizza, but the spinach salad with blue cheese was an embarrassment. We ordered one each for my friend and I - we just wanted to have a light meal paired With a glass of vine as a yearly trip to Yorkville . When we got the salad , it literally consisted of spinach , two raisins and two pieces of walnuts . I thought that the dressing And blue cheese were covered . Not the case . We had to point it out and got a new salad . It looked \"right\" the second time.However , for the busy place that has a good reputation it lucked the fresh fig And the dressing was too sweet. I would say Wendy's salad is superior to that one and I am still puzzled how they could even serve us the first one with no dressing to begin with. I would fire the chef, that is how bad it was. I also asked for some fresh bread and was served plain white slices of baguette with no butter on a side . To make it \"warm \" it was toasted in the oven . First one for me .., being In a classy place. The Overall rating of three stars is very appropriate. Would I come back? Don't think so."}
{"text":"As I understand it, they make their own pasta...I came here with a gf, who is gluten-free (they offer a gluten free pasta option).  I ordered a penne with gorgonzola cream sauce.  Yum...(I can't remember what else was in the pasta but it was delish).  We paired our mains with chianti - also yum, and finished off with creme brule.    They had both indoor and outdoor seating available, but we opted for indoor seating, as it was pretty humid and muggy out, and a storm was pending.  Overall a great place to visit.  The food is good and you're served by real italians.  Our server loved pasta - so I went with that.    Dimmi doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"My review is much like others'.  There is nothing wrong with this place. Nothing on the menu is bad. But it tastes more like Woddbridge hall food, than anything else. You options are the pasta, pizza or a sandwiches. At least the prices are reasonable, for the neighbourhood.  The service is not good. The waitstaff were annoyed that they had customers, and we say a group of four staff (someone senior, a waiter and two kitchen staff) get into a fist fight.  I've eaten here before and the food is always okay. Not this time though. The pizza had little sauce and the bottom was burned. I don't think I'll be going back. Better choices in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I placed a take-out order for rigatoni a la vodka. This is the only place, other than Carmine's (NY & NJ), that I've had al dente pasta. The vodka sauce was also top notch.   The host / owner was very welcoming, even though I told him I'm from Brooklyn and the Nets vs Raptors game was on the big screen.   Go Nets!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those spots in Yorkville that you've passed countless times and never paid much attention to because of the neighborhood and the price tag that comes along with being in this neighborhood. Surprisingly this romantic little hideaway is not only tasty buy also reasonably priced.  There is a beautiful patio overlooking Cumberland to watch shoppers and hot moms with their dogs walking around. Inside feels traditionally Italian with dark wood tables, shelves along the walls displaying a plethora of tomato cans and pasta packages, high vaulted ceilings, and a fairly busy bar near the front door. The one thing that may not be Italian is the Giant flat-screen TV. The lighting can be a little dark in areas but I can forgive them. One note about this place, bathrooms are located upstairs! That's right, no taking the stairs to a dark and dingy basement that is so prevalent in Toronto. Instead you take the stairs up to a light and airy bathroom.   The service was fairly standard on my visit and not exactly the bend over backwards service I've been hearing about. But there was nothing wrong with it. The server was fairly polite and was able to accommodate all of the groups requests. Waters were filled with ninja-like deception and orders were remembered and executed as per requested. I definitely will come back to see if it was just an off night.  The food here was delicious. I had a pizza and it goes up on my list as top 3 in Toronto. The crust was thin and crispy with a slight chewiness that I've been looking for. The toppings were fresh and the cheese was the right amount. The sauce is basic but serves this pizza well. I tried some of the seafood pasta and vodka pasta and the noodles were cooked to a perfect al dente. The sauces were also very flavorful, I will definitely come back to try some pastas if I can ever convince myself not to order the pizza.  Overall, the combination of locale, price, taste, and atmosphere makes Dimmi Trattoria and instant recommendation for anyone looking to enjoy a nice meal in Yorkville. Makes me wonder why people even bother to go to Cafe Nervosa http://www.yelp.ca/biz/cafe-nervosa-toronto just up the street."}
{"text":"I was craving risotto so my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out.  We sat on the covered patio, which gave a nice ambiance.  I feel like this was luck too.  We had called in advance to make a somewhat last minute reservation.  We were told it would be no problem and provided our name.  When we arrived, however, no reservation.  Their reservation system is just names on a piece of paper that someone carries in their hand.  A system I don't really like b/c it has happened before that my reservations have been lost at other restaurants when they have the same system.  Fortunately, we were able to catch a spot on the covered patio and were lucky the rain had just stopped.    We shared the shrimp risotto to start.  It was a large portion, and we didn't want to fill up before the meal, so I took the rest home.  For the mains we had pasta special - lobster fettucine in a red sauce.    All in all, the service was good and the food was tasty, but there's nothing that really stood out as being off the charts.  I would go back though and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Checked this place out based on recommendations from some of my Canadian friends and I wasn't disappointed. Food is really good and the service was exceptional. Next time I'm in Canada I will definitely be back.  To start off we got the Margarita pizza to share and it was very good. Just the right amount of basil and mozzarella to match. The bread with oil & vinegar was also a great starting touch.  For our meals we all got separate pasta dishes. My dish was very good and my friends really enjoyed theirs as well. One friend did say that the meatballs didn't \"taste fresh\" but she enjoyed the pasta. Aside from her tiny complaint we enjoyed everything about this place.  Not only was the food great but the service was exceptional. Every surrounding waiter/ waitress was very charismatic, genuine and extremely helpful. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the country. It's a great choice if you're craving Italian food and are in the area."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and with tip and tax the bill came to $200. The food was quite good. However when I reviewed the bill I see they charged me for a glass of hot water and lemon. I expressed my concern to the manager and the response back was that lemons cost money and that they have to wash the cups. I do not feel that this is appropriate especially when someone spends approximately $200 on a lunch. The cost of the hot water was $1.75"}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place.  Came here for lunch.  Wonderfully delicious thin crust pizza.  Flavorful tomato salad.  Ask for the hot oil (you have to ask for it) and brush it on your thin crust pizza.  Add an attentive staff possibly with mafia ties .. what's not to like?  ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is a genuine gem in Toronto's coolest neighbourhood! So far, everything I've tried here tastes brilliant- and for a great price. The variety of pasta entrees makes it hard to decide, since they all seem so enticing, most of which are between $12-22 which is cheaper meal than most restaurants in the Yorkville area. I've been here a few times, trying different pastas every time. I always get to taste what my friends ordered as well. And so far, knock on wood, nothing was subpar. My personal favourite was the rigatoni a la vodka- a delicious entree in a vodka rose sauce.  You dine in a dim, upscale, buzzing atmosphere. There's also a great heated patio facing Cumberland. The place is a little small, although charming, which makes it a task to get a table on weekends, even if you try to reserve. Also, when the restaurant is busy, the service could be better.  I recommend this place to anyone in the mood for good pasta, pizza and drinks in a swanky neighbourhood. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us met here for dinner while working in the Toronto area. The atmosphere is great, the food was wonderful, and they do have an unbelievable drink menu   I dive into the Calamari Fritti and Fettucine Alla Rivera. Both were super tasty and I wanted more even though I was stuffed. We still managed to order coffee drinks afterwards and they were better than some other places in the area. I don't know what espresso they use but it was awesome.   Our waiter was personable, funny, and provided above average service.   Will definitely go back in June when up in the area for work again."}
{"text":"Dimmi provided us with a decent meal for a group of 9 on a busy Saturday night. We stopped in without a reservation and was told it would be about a 30-minute wait. I think it ended up being longer, but the host kept coming and apologizing and promising our table would be available shortly. The menu is large with options for everyone. We got a pizza and special risotto dish (at an overly priced $21). The risotto was well-cooked but the calamari in it was a bit rubbery/chewy. The pizza was good, but nothing to rave about. The wine was only ok and we had to ask repeatedly for water refills (the waiter appeared to be very busy). The restaurant is super dark and I remember commenting that there's no way older people could read the menu. Again, it's a good spot if you need to please a large group (as we did) but I can't say much more than that."}
{"text":"I was shocked when I looked at the menu and found the prices to be quite reasonable.  I mean this place is in Yorkville right?  An entree will run you a mere $12 to $18.  I had a beer and shared the Bresezze (sp?) pizza with my wife.  The pizzas are a great size to share (which makes this place even cheaper) or to eat yourself and have a couple of pieces for lunch the next day.  The food is really authentic and so are the staff.  I don't think one of them wasn't Italian.  The staff were really on the ball, taking away plates immediately and bringing more bread promptly when we ran out.  One of the girls we were with liked the staff so much she got the waiter's phone number."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. The food was decent. I had the Fettucini Alla Riviera. The sauce was okay but the portion was not that large - there was a reasonable amount of seafood but not enough noodles! The creme brule was pretty good. The prices are reasonable. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Tasty Italian food when I visit Toronto and stay in Yorkville. Service is hit or miss, waitresses are kind of all over the place as they wait on several tables at a time and sometimes I feel they're more attentive to other patrons. Awful Sangria, but perfectly cooked pasta. Love their Arrabbiata sauce!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere . Friendly staff and yummy comfort food. Definitely a nice choice while strolling downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I would rate this a 2 solely because the food is great. The manager is NOT.   I work in the area and my team department of 8 decided to have dinner on a Friday. My colleague reserved a table from 5-7pm which they said was fine on the phone. The service was great at first; very friendly and I loved that our waiter spoke Italian. At 545, we noticed it got a bit busier and the service was rushed. We dove into our food (I ordered the Pizza Salmone which was excellent) and sadly, we barely even got to finish it! Our plates were cleared so fast. Shortly after, the bill was presented. This was at 615. The colleague that reserved the table got upset and spoke to the manager about everything being rushed. The manager said to point at which waiters took our foods away. My colleague didn't want to point fingers and said it's up to management to train their staff better. He argued that there was a line-up through the door.  I guess all he cares about is bringing in customers, not keeping them.   Pity this place has amazing food and terrible management. Unsure if I'll come again."}
{"text":"Had a great meal there. Went with a friend for dinner and a bottle of wine. Food was excellent and service was great (despite the restaurant being packed). Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely phenomenal. I love everything they have from the gnocchi to pizza to risotto. All so delicious. If you're looking at apps, the burrata as well as the steamed mussels are fantastic.  Service has never impressed me, nor is it the worst. So I guess passable.  They have nice patios in front and to the side of their restaurant. Great for grabbing a bite and people watching. It's in Yorkville, so maybe celebrity watching...  The prices are a bit on the higher side, but it is a very nice establishment, so I think it's acceptable. Just know that you may spend $25-$40 here for lunch.  I definitely do recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food - 3.5/5  : Decent food with generous portion. Price is reasonable  Service - 1/5 : It is not surprising that many other yelpers have experienced the same problem. The server was very aggressive, abrupt, rushed, and unfriendly. Our server was the big guy. This waiter doesn't know the basics of serving. Shame on you, Dimmi bar for not training your waiters properly. Like I said, if you read the reviews here, you can see that I am not the only one who has felt this way.   Atmosphere  - 3.3/5 : OK, nothing special, but can't really complain.  Not going back anytime soon due to the violent service.  Nick"}
{"text":"Dining out a lot and watching too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmares makes me acutely aware of potential restaurant problems.  Conversely, when you eat at a well-run restaurant, you noticed it even more.  We had a very good meal at  Dimmi's.  We were greeted promptly, seated at our choice of patio or indoor dining rooms.  The restaurant does what I call team wait staffing, which means that the person who took your order may nit be the same server who brings your cocktail or food.  We were greeted pleasantly and waited on by no less than four different servers but each one was extremely pleasant and very efficient.    They have an extensive wine list including some very good wines by the glass.  We were served fresh bread with butter and thee was a tasty olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table too.  We order some wine which was served perfectly chilled and a fairly good portion for wine by the glass.  We both ordered pastas from their extensive list, but asked as for a alternative to linguini which was handled without any hesitation.  (linguini to me is too devilish to eat without saucing your shirt.)   The pasta portions were huge and deliciously prepared.    This place has good food, great service and some excellent people watching too!"}
{"text":"Booked a table for 6 for a bday lunch. Lovely atmosphere - menu is reasonably priced except if you order one of the specials. Server who approached us,  did kept trying to push us to order ASAP - we just ignored her and then another server was replaced who was more patient. I gave the same rating as Jon M. due to the \"rush service\".  Excellent food, came out quite quickly. Yes, I would return and I'm glad I discovered this gem through Yelp and was warned about the \"fast turning over table\" service. They do accept debit, credit and cash."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner during the week and the food was so so. There antipasto menu is long and everything on the menu sounds amazing.. But we were disappointed when it came because of how small the portion was and having it be a $16 plate which defiantly was a rip off. For my main course I had a pizza and it was good but lacked the usual flavour in stone oven pizzas. Would maybe give this place another try."}
{"text":"I always love coming to this place and have been frequenting this establishment for years, in fact pretty much every time I am in Yorkville I eat here. I'm not sure if it's the owner or the manager but this gentleman is always wonderfully helpful and promptly greets guests on arrival always willing to help out staff and perform a variety of needed tasks around the restaurant.  The general feeling of the entire staff seems to be pleasant and well versed to help with menu selections or questions.  The venue is intimate and classy but still casual enough to be comfortable especially with many of the competing bistros this place I find is the best of both worlds. The patio is on the small side however it is overlooking the bustling street and as long as your not crammed right next to someone the feeling is more spacious then many of the other bistros in yorkville. I like the dimly lit interior with rich colors and wood treatments reminds me of the quaint bistros in paris and the fact that they are located right off the walkway adds to that ambiance I think.  I find the menu to be one of the more affordable ones in Yorkville with very interesting specials. I had the pan seared scallops as an app and actually wound up ordering it twice it was that good! Delish!! Im a huge fan of their antipasto and pretty much every appetizer on the menu, they pair so well with the wide variety of wines available by the glass. I never have an issue picking a tasty new selection as the staff is always super knowledgable and willing to offer very helpful suggestions.  Pastas here are a pretty hefty portion and are melt in your mouth good! The agnolotti and gnocchi are among my favorites paired with the simple arugula salad I am always pleased. They also have a large selection of pizzas,  the crusts are crispy with some interesting ingredient pairings that once again perfectly compliment a good glass of wine which they have plenty of.  There really is some hefty competition but when it comes to Yorkville Dimmi's is always on the top of my lis, I do suggest you try if you're willing to splurge a tad"}
{"text":"Dropped into here for lunch with a bunch of co-workers. I haven't had real Italian food for a really long time and this was a really good place to re-visit the type of food again.  I had this fantastic pesto risotto that was perfectly cooked. Never had anything like it before. I've never had it cooked so well before either. Totally worth all of the money I paid (Roughly $20).  The service was great and I'm looking forward to going here again. I didn't see any gluten-free options here but if you aren't limited by that I'd definitely check this place out. The prices are a bit higher than most places but you get what you pay for here and it's definitely good quality there."}
{"text":"i enjoyed this place very much since the service was exceptional and the squash soup was out of this world! They also accommodated us by staying open later than usual and they treated us very well."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant. Easily the best value in Yorkville. Unbelievable food. Great ambience. Dimmi has it all. Five motherf***in stars."}
{"text":"It was pretty good Servers were constantly around, although they seem to be disappointed with our lack of big purchase. Food came out fairly quickly. Decor was a little too dark and the lighting was a bit too dim, but it seems like they were going for that style. Sat close to the bar area, so it was a little loud but I guess it should be expected."}
{"text":"Really well known for a \"no frills\" experience for Italian in Yorkville. Due to it's price point, it's a popular spot for lunch meetings.   The food is good and the service is fine. Ambiance is also just fine. It's a solid 3.5 star restaurant that doesn't strive to be anything more than it is. If you appreciate it for that, it's a great place."}
{"text":"Good food and slightly high prices balance out to make this an fairly average Italian restaurant in Yorkville. The gnocchi with asiago ($15.95) was good though not good enough to justify the price. The portions were large and the complementary bread was consistently replenished.  The prices must have recently been raised because my gnocchi is listed at $13.95 online. My dinning companions and I all agreed that the older prices are more in line with the quality of food. I'd go back to Dimmi if I was in the Yorkville area but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I went to Dimmi's again last week and had a similarly great experience. And just wanted to add that their service is great!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner tonight at the Back Patio and our server was Hannah (we hope you have the right server's name!). She had short hair, glasses, and an absolutely lovely and friendly personality. She was personable and had wonderful recommendations on the pasta. I had the gnocchi last time I came to the restaurant and loved it, however I wanted to try something new. She recommended the rigatoni a la vodka and my friend had the penne ligieria. Both were delicious. The quality of her service did not stop there, she taught us an awesome way to dip our bread. This level of service, that extra 5 minutes that she spent to make our night really makes a difference on how awesome and enjoyable our evening was. The manager was sweet and thoughtful and you can tell that this restaurant is dear to his heart. Thank you Dimmi Bar & Trattoria for such an enjoyable evening. Special thanks and appreciation goes to our server! She is fantastic! They will be seeing us again!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok, head the spaghetti meatballs.  Dessert was better, creme brulee.  Service was sketchy - our waiter was brusque and forgot to bring our drinks - I reminded him halfway through the meal.  The place can be very noisy, which seems to make some customers believe it's ok to just yell at the top of your lungs.  Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Dimmi is a busy popular Italian place in Yorkville. Casual and friendly atmosphere. Food is always very good and service is friendly. Lots of delicious pizza selections. Wine list is nice.I'm a regular here and I have never been disappointed. Reservations are a must."}
{"text":"Great staff, nice place and great food! Been there over 100 times and never had a bad experience!!!  YUMMY!  Best Penne Ala Vodka and since I don't eat bacon, I had them make it without and add chicken.  Simply amazing!  Their salads, their sandwiches, their pastas and pizzas are all made with LOVE. YUM"}
{"text":"Tl;dr version: quite good, though our sample was short, and there's a reason why I want to come back.  My son and I ate at Dimmi Bar and Trattoria 7/4/16 -- we had just gotten out of the Royal Ontario Museum and wanted a quick early dinner so he could get to the airport before his flight. We walked down the street -- okay, alley -- and found the restaurant just across from a TTC station entrance. We told the host that we needed quick service and she seated us in the back on the first floor -- there were maybe 3 or 4 other patrons. That is not about the food, but it's important to know that this has the feel of an Italian restaurant where you can have a leisurely meal. That was not what we needed, and the restaurant accommodated us -- we got served very quickly.   The food was quite nice -- my son and I both had pasta, definitely in the top third of Italian restaurants where I've eaten, and when I have a chance to come back to Toronto, I'll definitely come back here with friends and an hour or two to enjoy, including their wine list."}
{"text":"Dimmi's is at the top of my list of favourites in the Yorkville..Great atmosphere, the food was amazing whether your going for a couple appetizers to pair with drinks or a full course meal. The service is fantastic, everyone's very friendly and you'll feel welcomed.  It has a nice patio too backing onto Cumberland so late at night with a date you enjoy a nice glass (or bottle :) ) of vino and car gaze.  If your in Yorkville, go on in, you'll have a good experience. The prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch with co-workers for a work event.  One my co-worker who is Italian picked the place and she highly recommended gnocchi and risotto.  I wasn't feeling very adventurous today so stuck with what I usually get Italian restaurants, the seafood fettuccine (Fettucine Alla Riviera).  The noodles must have been house made, it was delicious and the sauce was so tasty.  It also had lots of seafood including clams, mussels, scallops, squid and shrimp.  The location is very central in Yorkville and a great place for friends get together and it also has a nice patio.  I will definitely be coming back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"After having my dining experience here I can definitely say it is my absolute favourite Italian restaurant! Excellent food, atmosphere, welcoming staff and overall a hit to share time with great company.   I ordered the Cumberland Pizza with the Peach Sangria which was beyond delicious. You definitely get your money's worth. And on top of that they serve complimentary bread! I don't live near the area but travelling to this spot is a for sure thing -- Will for sure come back here!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service and really great Italian fare. A++ all around.  There were 3 of us visiting Toronto from out of town late on a Friday night with no reservations. The hostess directed us to the bar where we got our drinks and we took in the great local atmosphere. Within 10 minutes we were seated in the back room near the kitchen. The waitress was great, she didn't rush us and answered lots of questions for us. We decided to share a few plates and enjoyed them all. From the cucumber salad, to the buffalo mozzarella salad, an arugula topped pizza and a very generous portion of the grilled lamb special. We were pretty stuffed by the end of the meal. Would definitely go again next time I find myself in Toronto!"}
{"text":"the last time I came here with my girlfriend, one of the cooks punched out a hobo. it's my best memory of this place. i think it's my fifth time eating here and the food seems like it's tasting better and better everytime we come back. after a long, hot day walking around toronto after my brother's graduation, I just wanted to eat some good italiano food.   We had a party of 14 which we couldn't sit together (girlfriend and I sat separately close by). customer service was top-notch and made the experience much more memorable. food came all together and about 15 minutes after we made our orders. We ordered a bunch of appetizers for 2 with mussels. the mussels were a bit small but the sauce was delish! my girlfriend and I shared a spinach walnut salad and a dimmi pizza (spinach, grilled chicken) - ya, i know we love spinach. since we have some perks, we were given a shot of alize blue and cotton candy which is fun for the kids. there's definately a lot more on the menu we'd like to try, like the shrimp risotto.   Overall, the atmosphere is excellent. they dim the lights after 8pm for a more romantic setting. the owner is always walking around making sure everyone is having a good time and also helping out with bringing out food. the staff are engaging and are easy to talk to. As for budget, there are only a few items $20+ and most are around $13-18 which is really good for the wallet knowing that it's in the trendy area of yorkville. If you want dessert afterwards, there's a gelato place close by. this is my favourite in this area and i'd recommend this place to friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"The food is good. It feels a bit run down. WAY too many flies, all year around, so many flies that it's hard to eat without getting annoyed or turned off.  I recommend ordering food to go, not a place to sit down."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Dimmi for the umpteenth time today. It's nearby by office and my Italian boss loves this place, so I get treated often.  They take reservations (recommended, even for lunch!) and the place is usually at least half full for noon hour dining.   I usually try to be healthy and get the daily fish special (today it was halibut) and comes with a side salad.   The pizza bianco is absolutely gorgeous (prosciutto and rosemary). Most of the pizzas are quite reasonably priced at $12-$13. Huge, traditional Italian thin crust, I have yet to finish one but I bring leftovers back to the office.The veal on a bun is great too.   I haven't tried any of the pastas (I'm not a pasta fan) but they have a great selection of those too. The menu states you can sub whole wheat spaghetti for any of the white pasta dishes, if that's your thing. Although why you would want to do that is beyond me, if you need fiber in your diet I suggest just eating some broccoli later on in the day and stick with the tasty white pasta instead of that chalky tasting stuff.  No complaints about the service, they have been fast and friendly every time I have been there.  I've never seen any celebrities at Dimmi but I'll keep looking. Celeb sightings or no, Dimmi is a nice dark, cosy place to enjoy some traditional Italian foodage.   Great cappuccinos too!"}
{"text":"I haven't visited Yorkville much. I usually come here for business dinners, go to ROM on occasion and once in a while take a sneak at the high end stores that line Bloor.   When my partner in foodies suggested this place-I knew it would be a good choice. We got a court side table for two at there limited outdoor Terrance facing the Yorkville alley. Overhead and across from us the Japanese restaurant, Kimono, started it's rooftop terrace which turns into a club later in the evening. They started their house music.  Our waitress was welcoming, riciting the evenings' meal specialties while making sure that each choice we made was accompanied with either \"is there anything else\" or \"how did you like your meal/drink\"  We ordered straight from the menus, we both eyed several pasta dishes of which we targeted two of their signature creations.  We ordered also glasses of red Chauvignon which complemented our main meal choices well  Dimimi has been a staple main stay for several years and it hasn't been deterred with other new competition over the years.  $$-$$$"}
{"text":"This place was great for the outdoor table that we got for two but then it stops there. The tables are cramped against each other and the man smoking the cigar at the next table exhale all over our food. Risotto was terrible that day, and our bottle of wine sat in some kind of plastic container/bag that looked like it was contaminating the wine. Other dishes were nothing special and we were disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has caught my attention for a number of reasons.  1) Everyone there seems to care that you have everything taken care of. From the waitress who was always looking for the body signs of when we were ready to order, to telling us things won't be too much longer, to a guy (who I think was the owner) handing me my napkin because I didn't put it on my lap quick enough and also thanking us for coming and asking us how the food was.  2) Good prices for Yorkville. Although I don't know if this place has some high profile chef like other high end restaurants, the fact that this place can show people that they don't let the allure of Yorkville go to their heads and charge ridiculous prices gets a thumbs up from me.  3) Very accomodating to changing needs. I wanted the gnocchi, but my love of tomato sauce made me ask to get the sauce changed on the dish. No problem. Also, when the dish came I wanted to gorge on the sauce so I asked for an extra side of tomato sauce. No problem.  4) Their tomato sauce is as close to my benchmark of awesomeness to date in Toronto. I haven't been to a lot of Italian restaurants in Toronto, but so far this is my favourite.  I can't say too many ways this place needs to improve other than maybe some more lighting and the tables can be a little crowded. Although I won't be doing backflips for the gnoochi, I still enjoyed it and would like to try other dishes at this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here with some old friends from Santa Monica on a Friday evening. We had reservations for 6:30 and our table was ready and waiting for us. The manager greeted us at the door and the evening got only better from there.  The service was great, the decor is attractive and the food was very good. We never felt rushed and had a very enjoyable evening. Living in the west end of Toronto, we took the subway rather than fighting the traffic and searching for parking. Talk about convenient, the Cumberland St exit from the Bay subway station is, literally, right across the street."}
{"text":"Came here for a team lunch with my work colleagues.  We were welcomed with fresh warm bread at our table, with herb infused olive oil and balsamic vinegar - it was a perfect way to get our appetites going.  For lunch I settled on the Diavola Pizza which was made up of tomato sauce, mozzarella, and spicy homemade Italian sausage.  When everyone's food came to the table I kept doubting myself as to whether I made the right decision on what to order, as all of the dishes looked so good!  But my pizza tasted great and really hit the spot!  For a restaurant located in Yorkville the prices are very reasonable - I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Was recommended this restaurant by a friend who claims it's her favourite. I can see why! It's a nice cozy restaurant in Market Lane plaza with really good Italian cuisine. We got the calamari to start and it was one of the best I've had. It was light and crispy. Fried to perfection without being greasy. I got the seafood linguine which was amazing. Pasta was the perfect cook, and there was a wide assortment of seafood. My only complaint is that the mussels were a little gritty. My friend got the special of the day which was baked salmon with an arugula salad. Salmon arrived wrapped in tin foil which made for a home style presentation which she did not really like, however the fish was good. Tiramisu for dessert and it was delicious. Best I've had. Just the right amount of texture and espresso flavour without being soggy. Servers here are attentive and quick to refill our water glasses and bread basket. Ask for the chilli oil to spice up the food. Overall, would definitely come back and try their other mains."}
{"text":"Delicious pasta! Their Rose sauce is incredible, the tiramisu is to die for. The cons are the bread they serve before your meal, it's cold and not the best. Service is great and salads are tasty too."}
{"text":"Food and service are 5 stars, try the linguine with clams cooked to perfection. The arugula salad is a nice light side sharable dish if you are planning to eat a heaving pasta meal."}
{"text":"This was a great little find in Toronto. Not sure why the low star reviews. Went here with a party of 4 late at night and the staff was very nice. Really cute restaurant and the staff was great--they all work together so you really don't have to wait for anyone. We all got basically the same thing which was the FETTUCINE ALLA CICCIO (Wild mushroom, cherry tomatoes, truffle oil in a aglio e olio) $ 20.95.  This was very good but the portions were small. We ended up ordering another bowl for the 2 of us 2 split. The only issue I had with this place was while I was eating I noticed that the pasta tasted homemade. It did not say anything on their menu. I asked the girl and she said yes it was homemade and it had eggs in it. I am vegan and do not eat eggs. She just said I should try and ignore it.   Not that easy for someone to ignore that is vegan and was not really a nice thing to say. I wish they would have put it on their menu that all pastas were homemade so other vegans would know this. Kind of put a damper on my meal.   This is a great place to eat if you are not vegan. But if you are they do not have anything other than the plain Insalata mista which was nothing special.  They do have a great wine list. If I ever become a non vegan (which I doubt) I will be back here for sure. I wish I could have posted pictures but my US phone just would not allow it."}
{"text":"First went five years ago with my university Italian club and it was a blast. We all had pasta or risotto which were great, and we can't forget the charismatic waiter with the beard. My friend had asked for a caffe corretto with amaretto, but instead he brought her an espresso and on the side a separate shot of amaretto! Unforgettable evening! :)  Returned yesterday and sat on their patio - a perfect spot on a beautiful, sunny day. My friend and I caught up over a glass of white wine and split the spinach and walnut salad with blue cheese and the vegetable focaccia, which was more of a piadina-like wrap. It was delish! Apparently their sangria is good too, but it's not cheap at $12 a glass or $45 a pitcher, though I am curious to try next time. The servers were all very nice and friendly. Def recommend this place. Plus, word on the street is it's also a fave of Andrea Bargnani's! ;)"}
{"text":"First impression, very cute little spot. One of the owners quickly seated us and the server was quick to tend to us taking our drink order. One of the owners ( I assume - cause he made mention of some dishes named/created by his grandfather who's photograph hung behind me) made suggestions on what I should order and was happy to customize a pasta for my husband. My husband enjoyed his meal very much \"one of the best cream sauces\" he's had. The pasta I got was ok - the sausage was very tasty but the dish itself lacked a bit of flavor. When I am back in town I would give it another shot and try pizza on my next visit."}
{"text":"Went to this place with a large group for my birthday and the staff was RUDE. It seemed as our server was annoyed at large groups. After awhile he started to warm up, but overall I was not impressed with the service.  The food was hit or miss, my pesto chicken pasta was delicious but my friends stuffed pasta consisted of 8 pieces of pasta floating in watery sauce. Pizza's were really good.  Dessert was also great, creme brule and tiramasu.  Nice place for a smaller group!"}
{"text":"Dimmi Bar & Trattoria was busy even on a weekday afternoon. We got stuck at a table near the kitchen so I total feel that the place was buzzing with actions...  Standard Italian restaurant menu so everyone would definitely find something that they enjoy....   3 of us ended up sharing:  Baby Spinach and Walnut Salad ($14.95)  in a honey balsamic vinaigrette with roasted walnuts, blue cheese, and candied fruit was delightful. It is hard to believe but this was the best part of my lunch.  Fettucine Alla Riviera ($19.95) With shrimps, scallops, mussels, clams and calamari with a really really light tomato sauce... a little too light maybe? Portion is really small...definitely not good for sharing! I can eat 2 of those.....  Diavola ($14.95) Pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella and spicy homemade Italian sausage... My Yelp friend who is a spice lover was draw to that when he said SPICY!... but definitely that's not too much heat but plenty of sodium.... now I am a feeling that I am going to stick with veggie or plain options for pizza toppings from now on...  Service is lukewarm and rush as the staffs were busy serving the lunch crowds....  I think I would give Dimmi a pass... I probably won't be coming back for their cooking, but if you are in Yorkville, you probably can give the place a try!"}
{"text":"Also fabulous spot the the loan traveler.  They make you feel comfortable when alone.  It true everywhere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a late dinner at Dimmi's on Saturday night. I'm new to Toronto, and had heard good things about Yorkville, and I was NOT disappointed! Everything was superb.  It was about ten pm when we arrived, and the restaurant was busy, but not out of control. We got seated immediately outside, in this beautiful nook beside a pedestrian shopping street. I could see beautiful tea lights twinkling along the trail beside our table, there was a slight breeze in the air, and I was sitting across from my fab boyfriend. What more could you want?  Our waiter approached us almost immediately, and was one of the friendliest waiters I've had in a while! My boyfriend ordered a beer, and I ordered their Sangiovese, which was phenomenal. Our appetizer came out in a timely manner, (calamari fritti), and it tasted excellent.  After a delightful chat with our waiter, where he found out my boyfriend's whole life story (including that he is from New York,  his career, and his thoughts on hiring/firing the \"nice\" guys at work), we received our delicious entrees. I was ballsy and went for a crazy pizza with figs and honey! My risk turned out to be a success, as it tasted phenomenal! My boyfriend loved his pesto pasta with chicken as well.  I would totally recommend this restaurant for a date night! I'm definitely going back! :)"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Took forever to get our food and the server was so rude. Food was bland. Never coming back here again.   Mark"}
{"text":"It didn't occur to me until recently that this place takes reservations, and at busy times I'd highly recommend one. It's not unlikely that you'll spot some of Toronto's sports glitterati while you're at Dimmi (I've seen both Tie Domi and Andrea Bargnani) as it's in the Yorkville area where they both like to shop.  The service at Dimmi is quick and efficient and they never make you feel rushed, even when it's incredibly busy. I always order the Gnocchi alla Dimmi (gnocchi with tomato sauce and asiago cheese) - I've tried to be more adventurous and order other things but I always come back to my mainstay. I've also tried the Sticky Toffee Pudding and it was fabulous!  They also have takeout if you call ahead to order."}
{"text":"It was all kinda so-so. We all ordered the specials which were bland (but properly cooked). The wait staff was friendly (but with an edge of Yorkville attitude and maybe not the most professional). The bar made very bizarre caipirinhas (some weird lime rickey thing which resembles no caipi I've ever experienced!) which they did graciously take back. But overall, $400 for a round of cocktails, appies, mains and a modest bottle of wine for 5 people didn't leave me feeling good about the experience."}
{"text":"little bit expensive, but great taste and good dinner experience."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. We were seated promptly and our waiters were able to recommend good food and check up on us frequently."}
{"text":"SO disappointing! 4 of us came here because a friend recommended it as one of the only good places in Yorkville, saying it's run by a family so they really are great with service and quality -- far from true. Every detail of this place is stuck back in how restaurants used to be a decade ago. Basic things like the bread being dry and cold would make any Italian stand up and leave right away. The \"truffle\" fettuccini came cold, with zero taste, let alone a truffle taste. We also tried the \"halibut special\", which again was just a lukewarm piece of tail. Risotto was equally disappointing. Their food would be alright if it was $10 a plate (since that's the quality and freshness of ingredients they use, and the portion size), but expect to spend a good $60 plus tax, tip & drinks per person."}
{"text":"It's my favorite Italian in that area. I love the atmosphere and the staff are very friendly. The chicken spinach pizza is really good and the chicken sandwich is amazing ! I love the location too."}
{"text":"Third time returning customers, this place has amazing pizzas, service is great the only thing I can say is it gets very loud in there, especially on the weekends, last time I was there I couldn't hear the person across from me, it was very busy there though, the place was packed. I recommend going during the week if your looking for a quieter setting. Definitely will be back soon to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"i've been to toronto twice and i wish i came here both times! i'll be here EVERY time from now on. i totally forgot what pasta dish i had, but i scarfed it up like a monster. the drinks here are strong too (finally a place that can get me tipsy on two drinks). service is impeccable as well. it's always packed and for good reason. you need to wait a while for an outside seat, though!"}
{"text":"Came here with some buddies prior to a very eventful night out.   Upon arriving I realized just how small this place was. There was 9 of us, luckily we made reso's in advance. Our table wasn't ready, so we hung at the bar and had a few drinks. Tender there was nice and knowledgable of various drinks.   About 20-30 mins later we were seated. Ordered a couple antipasto plates and a few types of pizza for apps. Both were delicious. Particularly the pizza with the spicy Italian sausage. Was amazing.   On to the mains, most of the table got the meat of the day or the chicken. I had the steak, which was cooked perfectly. Came with fresh veggies and potatoes also really good. I didn't try the chicken, but again, looked amazing.   On to dessert, I had a slice of tiramisu. Was ALMOST as good as home made, lol. It was good. Some of the best I've had for sure.   All in all. Great food and atmosphere. Small and cozy. I'll definitely be back with the S/O. Worth a try if you've never been. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yelp cliché alert: I wish I could give this place half stars. That's the first time I've ever typed those words, but I'm so darn in between three and four on Dimmi! I remember my elementary school math, though, so I know to round up when it's .5.   The food here is tasty, fresh and cheaper than the average Yorkville restaurant. The pastas and the patio are both fabulous. The only downsides are the service is a little rushy and the decor is a lot dated. These two cons are actually enough to make the dining experience, well, you just never quite get as comfortable as you'd hope.   Stick to their pasta, have some wine and try to snag a seat on the patio."}
