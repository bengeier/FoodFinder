{"text":"The prices are good, the food is authentic and the portions are big.

The laksa is flavourful and quite spicy (even when we ordered as mild as possible). 

I liked the durian shake because I could taste the durian. This is definitely not for everyone.

Only a few seats available so it's best to get it to go. 

Call and order ahead because there is usually a wait, especially around lunch time."}
{"text":"I've been coming back to One 2 Snack for a couple of years now and for good reason.  They have very good food.  The laksa is delicious and I have friends who swear by the kwetiau.  However, having said all that, I do have some minor gripes with the tiny restaurant that could.  

First, there is barely any place to sit down.  It's alright when you are the only one in the restaurant, but when there are several people ordering and waiting for their order, finding a quiet place to eat your meal can be a tall order.  There is a food court nearby with plenty of seating, however, upon entering this food court there is a sign that explicitly say no outside food allowed.

Second, and something I find quite annoying because it has happened on multiple occasions, is that I'll go to One 2 Snack with the intention of ordering a certain dish, but once we get there we are told that the dish is no longer available and is sold out."}
{"text":"This place is good for your taste buds and wallet! It's a hidden gem amongst the typical chinese 'restaurants' in the plaza. The Malaysian food is consistently yummy! I've had the curry laksa, char kway teow and loh meen (sorry for the spelling if it's incorrect). The desserts are also really really good!!"}
{"text":"Excellent laksa. Cheap and friendly. Crazy busy at times esp on the weekend.

This is one of those find you go back to whenever you need that noodle fix. Place is a little diveish and the plaza is ghetto. But the food is great. Owner or his son is really friendly."}
{"text":"What can I say?  We live in Mississauga and whenever we head eastbound or pass through Scarborough, we will never fail to drop in for a meal PLUS lots of takeouts.  Love love love their Laksa, Char Kway Teow, Wat Tan Hor Fun, Mee Siam, Hokkien Mee, Nasi Lemak, Curry Chicken to name a few as well as most of their traditional snacks \"Kueh\".  This is a family business and service from the whole family is just incredible.  I say super 5 or even 6 stars for their service.  Wish they were in Mississauga so I don't have to travel that far to enjoy this type of gourmet Malaysian food at such affordable prices."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekend and this place is still as awesome as ever. Got the laksa, wat dan hor, curry puffs and a selection of desserts - everything was so delicious! They cook per order so your food is guaranteed to be piping hot! If you're coming for lunch, you should come early or be prepared to wait. Their desserts also sell out fast so if you know exactly what desserts you want, you should order over the phone!"}
{"text":"The curry laksa was very flavorful with quite a few pieces of chicken leg meat, tofu puffs, fish balls, 2 shrimps, lots of bean sprouts and 2 kinds of noodles for the authentic way of enjoying this dish. Portion was very generous, soup piping hot. Very reasonably priced at $6.75. 

Too bad that they no longer serve any dessert items during the weekdays now. 

Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The curry laksa  and char kway teow were amazingly delicious and full of flavours. I'm surprised the portions were huge with lots of meats.

On the downside, this place is very busy especially on weekend. The chicken satay and desserts are sold out very early and the service was very slow (about 20 mins wait time). However, the front-staff was friendly and helpful. 

Definitely recommend to call-in to pre-order before heading over."}
{"text":"Came here today with my friend for the first time. We had had the laska and kway tuew noodles, with mixed noodles and spicy. Both were great and were really tasty. Let me say, the service is amazing ! The server/cashier gentleman who runs the show, the few cooks at the back are spectacular. Even though it's a small place, the food and service makes up for it! We came at 11 when it opened and people start lining up right away ! It speaks for it itself. You might have to wait a while until your food comes as I seen a few people who came later, wait longer, but that's just how patient people, being worth it. Call ahead to make an order if you don't want to wait a while. 

The one cashier/server gentleman even ran out of the store to offer a bag for my takeout ! It brought a smile and good experience for me. All the customers seem so friendly and talkative too. We could see that he tended to all customers and really cares about service. That's never happened to me. How awesome. Come here if you're ever around the area. I'll be coming back that's for sure."}
{"text":"This place is hidden inside Glen Watford plaza right across CIBC area. Its small place that can only seat a few ppl, but the effort of creating authentic Malaysian food by a small family is evident. The place has nice options of snacks, mains, and desserts. Here is a list of things I have tried and will give you an outlook on.

Curry Potato Samosa- Pretty good and good value!
Pandang (Crepe with peanuts)-Good
Chicken Satay- Great value and taste
Char Kuay Teow- Fresh ho fun and it taste better with crispy pork fat (optional)
Wat Tan Hor- Nice and fresh tasting with Ho fun being made.
Singapore Laksa- The broth is nice, but the stuff on it I am not a fan of.
Nasi Lamak- Great portion for the price of $6

Desserts: Kuay Talam (sticky jello like with sweet and salty flavour). This is a must-try.

Overall this place is actually better in certain things than Gourmet Malaysia. The price is fair, and the hard working family do take care of their customers."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. The cha kway teow is amazing.  The satay is legit. Almost tastes like in asia. Must try. It's a tough place to find, literally a hole in the wall. 
Usually my husband doesn't enjoy food like this,  but he loved it."}
{"text":"I'm Malaysian and I'm so glad we found this place. Food was authentic & delicious at great prices. We had nasi lemak, char kuey tiao, roti canai and mee siam. Service was very good. There ample parking space but shop is very tiny. It's better to call them to order ahead of time.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Best Malaysian food in Toronto with amazing prices! The Laksa and Char Kway Teow dishes are super tasty. Make sure you go in on the weekends early to try the desserts before they run out. The service for a hole-in-the-wall establishment is also great-- the person at the counter is super polite and helpful with ordering."}
{"text":"This is the better, if not best, Malaysian restaurant in the GTA. Granted it's not really a restaurant (more of a take-out place, it has a bar and a few stools) but it's run by Malaysians and serve pretty authentic Malaysian food. My favourite is their nasi lemak (much better than the neighbouring Malaysian restaurant's)! They are also good for Nyonya Kuih (dessert food) and we had bought a big platter of it for parties. 

I recommend calling ahead to see if they have the food you want to eat before making trip there (especially for the kuih)."}
{"text":"Be prepared to have long wait if you're unlucky. Sometimes they have big order by phone coming in.

As for the food, it's worth the trip. Portion is gigantic and they don't skimp on the spices or ingredient.  My recommendation: Char Kew Tiao, Lor Mee, and Laksa."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!

Although it takes quite a bit of time for them to prepare your order, I assure you that it's worth the wait! Everything on their menu tastes great and I come here at least once a month. 

My go-to dishes are the Char Kway Teow, Curry Laksa, and Chicken Satay. Although the Chicken Satay serving is quite small with 5 mini skewers, their peanut sauce makes up for it. 

Please keep in mind they are only opened from Thursday - Sunday whenever you get a craving for some Malaysian food so you don't go and get yourself disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time visit this place after browsing the yelp for Malaysian food
Entrance was not very lively but after settling down and ordered the Laksa chicken and a roti chicken take out .
The portion isopod for the price and would say that it quite authentic 
With very close to originality of real Malaysian food
Would recommend this place and suggests that more advertisement be promoted."}
{"text":"Add me to the list of fans of this fantastic little joint churning out to-die-for delicious Malaysian dishes!

I've been here once before, and we were lucky enough then to nab a couple of seats, and know how busy this place gets.  This time, we placed a take-out order by phone, timing it for after Thursday's lunch time rush, and were told the food would be ready in 25 minutes.  This was perfect timing as it took roughly 30 minutes to get to One 2 Snacks from downtown.

This time we ordered:  Char Kway Teow with egg (2 orders as we cannot get enough!);  Chicken satay;  Mee Goreng and a dish we'd never had before - the Meehun siam:  
-  Enough have been said about ther Char Kway Teow on Yelp - the \"wok hay\" is very apparent (a good thing) and it's filled with chicken, fish, and egg - that I do not need to say more.  
-  The Meehun siam was a revelation!  Only a few photos of this dish on Yelp and not many comments, but took a leap of faith, and went for it.  The vermicelli noodles were flavourful, and not oily at all!  In fact, they were fluffy, again with wok hay, and lots of fillings.  Amazing and will definitely be part of our standard order.
-  The Mee Goreng was carefully packaged as takeout, with a foil liner for this dish in particular to prevent melting of the styrofoam box (Not sure why the other noodles were not packaged this way). The noodles were a little bit soft (would have prefered al dente) but it could be due to time sitting in the car to take home.
-  Chicken satay - the peanut sauce is good, but not even needed when the chicken meat itself is so flavourful, and tender. 

You'd think with three kinds of noodle dishes that it would be difficult to discern the flavours between each, but they all had their own distinct tastes as well as texture.

When we arrived for pickup, the parking lot was full.  Despite it being afgter lunch, there was a line to pickup, but everything was ready.  And all the seats were filled.

How they manage to keep the prices so low is beyond me!  Under $38 for our entire order (4 orders of noodles + satay).  And now we have tons of left-overs to continue to enjoy the yumminess of One2 Snacks.

The only disappointment is that we did not order the Laksa, as we didn't know if it would travel well as take-out, and wanted to avoid any potential spills in the car."}
{"text":"People. PEOPLE. This is the best Malaysian food you will find in the GTA.

Since my family has a rabid love affair with food, we often drive great distances (read: to Scarborough) for a delicious meal. 

In fact, it's not uncommon for my Dad to stop what he's doing and just say \"Malaysian?\" We all know what that means. It means we're going to drive from Mississauga, call up One2 on the way, and salivate over the idea of the char kway teow we will ferry back home.

The owners and their son are unfailingly polite, so wonderful. It's great to see that they are doing so well (and they sell out of some things too!). The hot-as-hell chili sauce is made in-house, and terrifyingly good. You only need a smidge; it adds such a kick to all dishes!

But the food itself needs no adornment (we're just crazy and like to torture our taste buds). The char kway teow is by far our favourite dish. The shrimp and chicken are cooked to perfection. The sauce is a great balance of spicy, sweet and salty. Honestly, I could eat this all day, erry day.

The laksa is also amazing, with its rich coconut curry, fish cakes, tofu and chicken. You can get a mix of the vermicelli and yellow noodles in your order. And why not? Go crazy and eat up!

I'm gonna give a final shout out to the roti canai (chicken curry that's not unlike Indian in flavour) with a few soft roti to boot. It's simple, home cooked food made with love. It will make you cry with happiness. 

Please, do yourself a favour and visit them. You've never had Malaysian like this before."}
{"text":"This small shop is open from Thursday to Sunday,  and have a weekday menu and larger weekend menu, that include deserts and BBQ items.  

The noodle dishes comes in three levels of heat and several noodles type.  All the food were made to order, and can take a bit if time to arrive.  

During our wait, the guy behind the counter was super helpful and informative.  We also noticed a lot of customers called in their order to save time."}
{"text":"Cost: Very affordable - 90%
Quality: 80%
Decor: Poor to none, very little space, can't eat there with a group
Staff: Very friendly, good service - 85%
Value: 80%"}
{"text":"Best Laksa in all of GTA. Well worth the wait!
So friendly, feels like home, truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"You will have to wait, but it's worth it. Today I tried the curry fish ball soup and the thin rice vermicelli  noodle stir fry. Asked for mild spice on both and they were both spicy and full of flavour."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service here- we ordered from their catering menu for a dinner party and they were incredibly helpful. They worked with us on amounts to order, vegetarian options and gave recommendations.
Their curry laksa, char kway teow and nasi lemak with chili padi chicken are phenomenal. And the desserts are subtle and not too sweet. I usually point at a different one each time because I don't know what they're called but I haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.... So hidden that I never the plaza existed!! Ignore the store front that looks unappetizing with random food posters and battle your way to the cashier.  Every item on the menu is delicious and affordable.  I recommend the durian dessert, if you're lucky enough to find any left.  Like most people that have already mentioned, call to order before heading.  This place is BUSY.  I waited over 30 minute for just two dishes.  Would not recommend dining in as the place is small and line ups are shoulder to shoulder."}
{"text":"Go on Sat & Sun mornings to get some very yummy Malay steam cakes and goodies. The durian 1 actually tastes like durian."}
{"text":"The best Malaysian restaurant in the city, hands down. Been eating and ordering take out from here a lot, always consistent on the taste, and this place is always packed everyday. Probably the best char kwetiaw since i moved to Toronto."}
{"text":"There is something inherently loveable about this place. It's a family run business, gracious service from one of the sons who runs the front on the weekend, its small, busy and there is just something so comforting as a bowl or plate of piping hot noodles made to order. 

Some things to note- it's not open Mon-Wed. The first time I showed up on a Wednesday after reading about it in the Globe and Mail I almost cried in the parking lot because I had psyched myself up for a plate of Char Kway Teow on my lunch break. So that following weekend I drove from downtown to satisfy my craving. 

The other thing to keep in mind is that it's not really a restaurant- ie. there is not a lot of seating. There are 4 or 5 seats along a window and a few small tables with stools.  Oh- be prepared to wait for your food, they do a lot of take out service on the weekend. 

What else did I love- the price, so affordable!

AND, if you go on the weekend there are a number of specialty items that are not available during the weekend. 

Is the best Malaysian food out there? It doesn't matter, there's just so much to love about this little hole-in-the wall spot. Can't wait to go back ...."}
{"text":"Great little place. Amazing food. We got the char kway teow with an extra egg. It was slightly over $9 with tax, which is on the pricier side for a noodle dish in this area, but the quality of the ingredients, portion size, and taste more than made up for that. The gentleman behind the counter was extremely helpful and spoke great English, which was helpful as we were slightly indecisive. The chef whistled a catchy tune that complimented the sounds of the kitchen, a balance that was definitely transferred on to the noodles."}
{"text":"I have never tried to eat Curry Laksa before but, now this is the one of the best soup I have ever eaten.
It was truly flavourful like creamy, spicy...and a lot of portion which I totally loved.  
We also ordered Char Kway Teow, chicken satay.
Although we were not familiar with any of the dish, it was surprisingly good and yet quite reasonable!
Highly recommended if you are in the area. 

FYI, they only take cash."}
{"text":"By chance came here since I was visiting a friend in Scarborough. Great take out place for Malaysian food! I could taste the coconut milk and chili in their laksa. Came with authentic Dow Pok (my favourite tofus!!), chicken, bean sprouts, vermicelli and egg noodles. Delicious! Wish they had a sit in place so I could have had it fresh. :) great place to check out if you're in the area. 
Tip: take out takes about 30 mins so order ahead!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good! Tastes like street hawker food in Malaysia, but bigger portions. When I was there, the guy at the counter said they are changing to mainly a noodle shop so they aren't carry roti canai anymore. They haven't updated their menu to reflect this yet though.

I had the curry laksa which came with fish balls, fried tofu, and chicken. Mild was already pretty spicy for me - I opted for mild because the guy at the counter said medium was like \"jalapeño+ spiciness\". Char kway teow had lots of fillings in it, was definitely delicious and one of the better ones I've had. Also had the chicken satay which was delicious. Their marinade is pretty sweet, but just on the border before too sweet."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday to pick up some quick and cheap takeout for dinner.  Good thing we came here at 6:30pm, cause they actually close by 7:30pm - so early! By that time, many of the items were already sold out (roti, chicken satay, various other snacky-type goodies).

So we got two laksa curry noodles: pick between the regular egg noodle or a mix of the egg noodle & vermicelli.  Then pick mild, medium or spicy for the curry.  We picked medium and spicy, having been warned that spicy is truly spicy.  We disregarded it and said yes to an extra little container of spicy hot paste on the side anyway.

Turns out that spicy isn't *killer* spicy (we also added that little scoop of spicy hot paste in too).  But it IS pretty tasty! Be sure to pour the bottom parts of the soup with the cooked curry paste at the bottom of the container into your bowl too.  The soup has all the unctuousness of a spicy shrimp paste, plus the satisfying slow burn of spice.

It takes awhile for the order to be ready (maybe 15-20 minutes?) but I think it was worth the wait. Another easy pickup spot added to our list!

TIP: The food here is really high in sodium.  Anyone with high blood pressure, beware!"}
{"text":"I travel all the way from downtown for them!  We've been going ever since they opened.  The wait is always between 30min-2hours, but he tells us so and we always pre-order via telephone.  We know the drill.  He's always so polite and you see him talking with all the \"aunties\".

We get the same thing every time:
Char Kwey Teow  - mixed noodles, spicy, better than anything we ever got in Malaysia
Curry Laksa - mixed noodles, spicy, best of Toronto (but I'm sorry I like Yee Fung's in Malaysia more)
Chicken Satay -  awesome...if you can get it.
Kuih - always sold out by noon.

Char Kwey Teow....mmm...I want some just thinking of it.

The demand is definitely outpacing supply now though.  There are times we can call for an hour nonstop and not have the phone picked up because they are just that busy.  The wait gets a little longer and the lines get a little bigger each year.  I hope they can share the family recipe with and hire one more chef."}
{"text":"Was looking for different food to try our and saw that this place had a good rating on yelp. The pictures were quite appetizing so we decided to go there. 
The place is small(not saying its a bad thing). The person on the counter was extremely helpful and spoke fluent English . He explained to us the ingredients in the dish we wanted and also replaced the sea food with extra chicken.
We had the Char Tway Teow with mixed yellow noodles. They offered mild, medium and spicy. The food was tasty and rich in flavor. Also had a LOT of chicken. Will definitely come back.
The prices have changed compared to the original pictures. I think they added a dollar more to all dishes."}
{"text":"Food is good...slightly bland. Service is great. The wait....horrible. TIP: Call in advanced to place an order.  Pick it up in an hour"}
{"text":"Best price to value! Their durian dessert was so yummy that I pretty much devoured the dish. I also had their taro cake, laksa noodle and stir fried noodle, and I was surprised there was such much meat in there for this price. I would definitely come back but I will call ahead next time, the wait was a little ridiculous"}
{"text":"this place is the real deal. 

I continue to search for the best Malay/Singaporean cuisine offersings in Toronto and I would have to say that Restoran Malaysia is probably the best but I find it well overpriced. I would say One2 Snacks is just as good with what they do serve but you end up paying half. The hor fun I ordered which is something I always order in singapore had the flavors spot on. If anything, I'm used to having all seafood ingredients and not chicken. Nasi lemak was alright but would have been better if they added a fried chicken wing (not uncommon) or something to include some protein 

Cons:
service is super slow (but friendly)
place is small and packed (not really a dine-in place)

Pros:
authentic food
friendly service

if you are ordering something be ready to wait. Place your order then watch a movie or something. Be prepared."}
{"text":"When I just return from Malaysia, I was looking for similar hawker style food. This little shop provide just that flavouring and price!!! Other restaurants have similar dishes, but this place does it best.  

The Mee Goreng is a nice comforting meal.  Char Kway Teow has been the only authentic tasting one in Scarborough in my opinion.  And I had many to compare.  Don't think just the starch dishes are great, tried the curry and roti combo, it was damn good.  This is literally good to the last drop.

Purposely returned on the weekend to test out some limited dishes, made a novice mistake in not calling beforehand, and waited almost 2 hr for the food (or it felt like it).  I encourage take out, and call 45 min in advance.  Brian will take good care of you."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to post this review because then more people will go here and make it even more crowded. But the food is so good I can't not write about it.

One2Snacks is only open for business on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sundays. Each time I've been here, it's always been PACKED! Expect a minimum of 15 minutes wait for your food. But trust me, it's worth the wait. If you're lucky, you can try calling in an order but because there is only one person working the front, your call may not go through. 

They have Malaysian style desserts which are glutinous rice with coconut. Super yummy! My favourite by far is their Curry Laksa. The bowl is bigger than your face!"}
{"text":"I learned so it this gem on Yelp and had to try it out due to the amount of positive reviews. I came here on a Sunday afternoon and the place had quite a line up.
It took about 15 minutes to even place my order.

I ordered the Chaw Kway Teow for take out. While waiting, many people had joined the line behind me. Some people called ahead to order for pick up. There is only one person taking orders and packing the takeout. There were two chefs in the back cooking everything. The staff were all working their hardest but the demand was just super high! It took almost another 25 minutes to get my food, which is quite long.

After opening the container, I knew that the wait was worth it! The smell was amazing and the taste was even better. I had my dish made mild because I can't eat anything too spicy. It really had \"wok hei\" which is a Chinese term when it is cooked with a really hot wok, which transfer a certain type of flavour to the food. 

There are many other dishes that I can't wait to try such as the Curry Laksa and the Mee Goreng next time. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody and would come back for sure. Just make sure you aren't in a hurry or call ahead of time!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to add about atmosphere---it's a tiny space in a strip mall and you have to wait a while. It gets quite a big crowd.

Overall it didn't quite live up to my hopes, but it was still solid. I spent a few weeks in Singapore about 2 years ago, and had even had laksa up in Melaka, Malaysia. Ever since then I've had vague hopes of having laksa that good again, but it never happens. This is as close as I've come in North America, but it wasn't quite right. The mix of stuff in the laksa was just right---noodles, tofu skin, fishballs---but the broth wasn't what I had hoped. I tasted a lot of curry and coconut, but my favorite laksas in Singapore and Malaysia all had a much richer spice mix and depth of flavor that was really missing here. Oh well.

If I went again, I'd probably try the Hokkien Mee---it looked really good on other people's plates, and the size of the fire under some woks in the kitchen looked quite promising."}
{"text":"you know this small, unassuming place in Dynasty Place plaza is worth checking out when there's barely any space to stand inside as it's filled with middle-aged ladies who know what's good. 

dine-in space is *very* limited, most take out orders. run by mom, dad, and son; mom runs the stove, dad is second in command, and son mans the frontlines with incredible patience and courtesy. they are non-stop all day long yet still take phone orders.

desserts are essentially offered weekend only unless you order by the tray for a weekday, and run out by early-afternoon (2-ish if you're lucky). the pandan crepes are sooo pillowy and filled with not overly sweet dried coconut i believe. delicious! food is easily sold out by end of the day so call to place your order before you go!"}
{"text":"I've heard their laksa was amazing but was disappointed. For me, the taste was so-so.. the base is more of curry than coconut, so it is probably just a different style. The best authentic laksa is still Restoran Malaysia in Richmond Hill. More rich and creamy coconut flavour. Also, it had too much noodles!!! Barely enough soup. I took it home and noodles ended up soaking the soup... Regardless, they do serve a generous portion and not pricy at all. This place seems to be very popular and always has line ups. Very small rundown shop, most of their business is from repeat customers calling in for take out. I waited for around 40 minutes for my food to come as I ate inside. Seems family run and people were nice. Not really sure what the hype is about."}
{"text":"Found this quaint small eatery on yelp.  I googled map the location and ventured forth looking for this restaurant which specializes in Malaysian dishes.
Ordered the Hokkien Mee and was very satisfied after I inhaled all that saucy, noodley goodness with tender fish cakes, shrimp and chicken.  Will definitely go back to try their other dishes. I hear the laksa is amazingly orgasmic...love me some laksa, la!

My only complaint is it's too small for such a popular hawker stall. I hope they expand or open another location like in Toronto, Yonge and Eglinton maybe? What do you say Bryan?"}
{"text":"This place literally has the best laksa in Toronto. Authentic, family owned and mean serious business. Try the pad Thai (mild is already pretty spicy so be wary) and the curry Laksa with half vermicelli half egg noodle. Your tastebuds will be overjoyed and you will be left with a very satisfying feeling.

Another unique item is the durian rice cake dessert, which sells super fast. We walked in right when they opened and there were only roughly 12 pieces left because people called in to order them. If you want to try, I advise to call in or walk in right when they open for business. 

Overall, quality of food and service is 4 stars. It's a small place, so it's best to order and take out."}
{"text":"The hype about this place is justified.  Portions are big and food comes with tons of \"wok hay\" which literally translates to wok breath and is used to describe food that has been cooked in a well worked in wok over very high temperatures, a highly coveted quality in Chinese food (this place sells Malaysian street food but the owners are likely Chinese-Malaysian - they can speak Cantonese).  

**ALWAYS CALL IN AHEAD ON WEEKENDS!!  They receive tons of large catering orders on weekends and wait times are often an hour+.  Don't let yourself be disappointed and call ahead.  Often times your call will go unanswered but they WILL call you back (their VM is always full but unless your # is blocked from call display they will call back) - if they don't (only happened to me once), they're probably so busy that you won't want to wait that long anyway.  Weeknights wait times are more manageable, but why not always call ahead just in case.

I love spicy food so always order their dishes extra extra extra spicy, which usually comes out at a perfect spicy level for me.  This did bite me in the butt once when I got the Mee Goreng - it came out so spicy my nose was running like a faucet within a couple bites.  Still ate the whole thing though, it did take a couple of meals :).  Strangely, my favourite dish is the Hokkien Mein, which is a non-spicy soy based stirred fried yellow noodle. Their chicken satay, the only dish of theirs I've tried where portion is on the small side, but is phenomenal.  The meat is expertly seasoned and comes out perfectly cooked and juicy.  

Lastly, I would say food, price & portion would've garnered this place 4.5 stars but the service most definitely brings it up to 5.  The place is family run, with the parents in the kitchen and the son being the cashier/order taker; I believe he's also the chef behind the desserts that are available only on weekends.  He is always very polite, respectful, and apologetic when there's a wait.  All around a very well run family business, and I'm sure they're doing quite well by it too - sure hope they are, they work their butts off."}
{"text":"Their curry laksa is really worth a try. Prices are all really affordable. Would of gave this place 5 stars only if the wait time wasn't that long (dined in and waited for 45 mins for food to be ready). If you do plan on trying this place, highly recommend you to call and place an order at least 20 mins before you arrive. Also, takeout would be a better alternative than dining in cause seats are very limited, as it is a very small restaurant."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch sometimes with my coworkers. I find the food to be average but all my coworkers really enjoy it. Portions are huge and the owners are quite friendly. Remember to call in advance if you want to place an order for pick up. They are a small family joint and they can get pretty busy. Their curry puffs are my favourite. Deep fried and spicy curry kick. Nothing's better."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday on Nov 2. 2014 !! I ordered the curry laksa and this sticky rice i forgot what its called but i loveddd the curry laksa sooo much!! 

Soooo good!!im coming back again for more laksa when i crave noodles :)"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic and dumpy...and thoroughly charming. Super friendly, polite and attentive staff. A must for aficionados of  Malay food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a year or 2 and it's the greatest! 

Service is great but on a side note I would preorder if you are doing takeout because it does take a while. There is only two people running the kitchen from what I can see and they do get flooded with orders throughout the day. Otherwise you can expect to wait from 20mins to 30mins.

Food, overall is delicious and I'm referring to all of their entree. I don't think I've tried anything that tasted bad. My favourite dish is their Char Kway Teow and Pad Thai.

Overall, i believe their dishes taste pretty authentic in terms of Malaysian cuisine. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Liked it, but didn't looove it, like other reviewers.

Perhaps it was the menu items I chose, (Singapore laksa and char kway teow), and both were very good, but didn't blow me away in comparison to similar dishes from other nearby competitors.

I am planning a second visit to compare the same dishes from here as well as two nearby competitors, and I will sample them head-to-head and post the results.

To be clear, the food was very good, the service and the owners were rushed but pleasant, and the lineup was absurd, but the overall experience was a very solid 3 or 3 1/2."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, it's delicious and filling, and authentic and they actually have proper spice levels (like a medium spicy is really a medium spicy and not a mild or super hot spicy). The smell of the kuey teow makes my mouth water, and the laksa is heavenly. 

The wait time for this place is redonk though, 20 minutes for a laksa. Maybe it's because I was insanely hungry and had nothing to do while I was waiting for my food except to stare at them in the kitchen in hopes they could see my puppy dog eyes and take pity on me and make it quicker. I recommend phoning in ahead of time so that your order would be ready for pick up. Or you can eat in, but there's literally 10 seats max at this place, so it's pretty cramped. 

One2 is closed M-W, which means they must be serving up some amazing food to only need to be running 4 days a week (and they serve some nice looking desserts on weekends only - I say nice looking because I have yet to try them). 

Recommend? Absolutely. But wait until I get my order in first so my wait is shorter, hungry me thanks you in advance."}
{"text":"Tastes alright.  Curry laksa is spicy. Be careful if you cannot handle spicy food."}
{"text":"Really good quality and quantity of food, cheap prices, and good service.

The family gets overwhelmed with orders sometimes so a wait is to be expected.

Pro tip: order over the phone to avoid the 30-60 minute wait."}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good.

I come by once in awhile for the pad thai and no other place compares to it!

One bad thing is that this place is rather small and gets really packed but the wait is worth it.

Come early or have something to occupy yourself with ;)"}
{"text":"This is a true hidden gem in Scarborough. I always get super excited when I do take-out here. This place has strange operating hours and sometimes they're not even open during those days. I always call first now to make sure they're actually open. Also, they only serve the desserts on wkends and they sell out quick! 

I love their Char Kway Teow and Curry Laksa - it's a must get! Their Pad Thai and Chicken Curry & Coconut Rice are alright, can't compare to the other two. Last time they told me they don't make the roti anymore. 

The owner (I think he's the son) is super nice and patient in this tiny busy place. There are a few tables for eat-in, but I recommend take-out unless you're okay with people waiting for their orders and standing around you. 

Their pricing is very reasonable. Once I ordered 4 entrees and 4 dessert pieces, and it was only ~$35."}
{"text":"Good little place that sticks to a small menu focusing on what they do best. Malaysian street food is regional and the food here is apparently Kuala Lumpur style. Therefore, the typical Char Kuay Teow that is normally Penang or Ipoh style where they only use the flat rice noodle with shrimps/cockles and bean sprouts, is different here since they mix two types of noodles and different meats.
If you grew up in Malaysia, KL food is sometimes classified as city food that has been modified.
Their weekend kuih is a hit and they do it really well.
It is primarily a take-out place but there are few spots for people who wish to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"One2Snacks may be the longest I've waited to try a place that I was desperate to get to within the city.

I split an order of Laksa and Char Kuey Teow with a friend, which was a great way to try a couple things.

First off, the place is small and you won't be guaranteed to find a spot since there's about 8 seats. BUT, you can't really complain, especially when you see the price and value of the food. Virtually everything is right around the $8 mark. The portions are massive and nothing is cheaped out, like little meat for example.

The Laksa is as easy a 5/5 to review a dish that I've come across.  I rarely invoke the \"I've been to this place, so I should know...\", but I honestly did spend a few months in Malaysia and this is KL-style Laksa measures up. The coconut milk-base broth is delicious and I can't keep it off my mind.

The Kuey Teow didn't reach the same heights, but was still very enjoyable.

There are a few items on the board that they no longer serve and have no intention of doing so in the future, so they should probably remove it - such as the roti canai unfortunately. Still, it would take several more variables in order to pull down this rating as it's such quality food at phenomenal value."}
{"text":"After a friend recommended this place a few months ago, I finally got around to picking some food up from here. I called them 3 times and they ended up calling me back right away. Made an order an hr ahead and still had to wait an extra 15 minutes for our food. This place is BUSY, but for good reason. Tried their char kuey teow and curry laksa. Both dishes were HUGE portions and delicious! I loved the smokey wok flavour in the char kuey teow. I will definitely be coming back here to try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Before you read on, be warned. If you don't order ahead, prepare for a 1 hour+ wait. Email or call to ensure your order is placed before you go. This place is not designed for arrive, order, eat. Cash only.

Now that that's out of the way, this place is absolutely the best Malaysian food, ESPECIALLY for the price. Amazing sized portions, flavourful, and authentic. The staff are polite, the food is top quality, and the service is great. I've been searching forever for such a great Malaysian food place and I can honestly say I've found it. Their Mee Goreng, Curry Laksa, and Char kway teow are definite must tries. You won't regret.

TL;DR: Order ahead, cash only, be wow'd."}
{"text":"Desserts are offered on weekends only, a few varieties of Nyonya Kuih (steamed \"cakes\" made with some combination of rice flour, glutinous rice or flour, coconut milk, grated coconut, and other yummy ingredients) are available each day but they fly out the door fast.  The stores opens at 11am, once I was there shortly after 12 only to find out that the desserts were almost sold out.  A must-try, but make sure you go early and on weekends only."}
{"text":"The absolute best in taste, customer service and professionalism. On top of all that, the prices are so reasonable. My hats off to the entire family! We picked up food to go around 2 p.m. on a Sunday and as per other reviewers, called ahead to place our order (which took 25 mins to be ready) and then were pleased to find no line-up when we showed up!"}
{"text":"VEEERY small place, awesome food...

Hadn't had actual Malaysian food in almost 17 years (when I was in Malaysia), until I went to Soos (on Ossington) yesterday, and felt like having more, so went to this place after a quick Google search!

Went in late afternoon/early evening with my kids, had the curry puffs, chicken satay skewers, char kway teow, curry laksa, and meehoon siam.

Curry puffs:  4/5--Hot, not fried, creamy filling, not spicy, kids loved it, maybe not flavourful enough for me, though...
Chicken satay:  5/5--Amazing, tender, great peanut sauce that was tangy/sweet, not too spicy either...  we could easily have had more!
Char kway teow: 4/5--good \"wok hay\", as others have mentioned... not enough shrimp, but lots of other goodies otherwise!
Curry laksa:  5/5--rich, savoury curry broth, lots of great noodles (chose only egg, wanted the more toothsome noodle experience), mix of shrimp, chickent, fried tofu, sprouts, etc.... GREAT on a winter's day!
Meehoon siam:  4.5/5--tasty, great mix with thinner rice vermicelli noodle (as my kids said, it reminded them of Sri Lankan \"string hoppers\", so this was their favourite dish); a bit bland for my taste, but much improved when I hit it with some side sambal.

Overall, the food was great, huge portions (barely finished 1/2 of the char kway teow or meehoon siam), great pricing.  Spent about the same today (just over $30) for a TON of good food as I did yesterday at Soos for basically one app and one (much) smaller main...  That being said, it's apples and oranges, as One2 is more hawker stall than fine dining!

However, when we went in, we DID get seating, as we hit a lull when there were only two regulars sitting in--we started to chat them up, and they, of course, were transplanted Malaysians who swore by the satays and char kway teow here.  The server was very gracious and polite. 

Had really hoped to have some roti canai or nasi lemak, but they were well sold out before we got there...

Will definitely be back, if not for eat-in, then definitely for take-out!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic
Laksa is the best in there
Pad thai is not my liking there though maybe not their specialty.
They get sold out so call before you come if it is later in the day."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem in Scarborough! My family and I tend to come here on a Friday or a weekend for the weekend specials. Pre-ordering on a weekend evening is definitely a must. There have been evenings where I forget to pre-order earlier in the day and they run out of their specials!

I would recommend their \"Wat Dan Hor\" which is a soupy flat noodle dish with thinly sliced fish balls and egg. My brother's recommendation would be the \"Mee Goreng\". Their mild is already spicy, so beware to those who cannot take the heat!

Another favourite of my family's is the Curry Laksa. It's mildly spicy and you have a choice of all thick egg noodles or vermicelli or a mix of both.

A definite must try!"}
{"text":"This small food store in a nondescript plaza is a true gem. This is one of the most unpretentious restaurants ever. They just want to serve good food at reasonable prices. 

In this modestly decorated place, you can find some delicious malaysian/asian fusion food. I'm no expert on Malaysian food, but the food here is very similar to Chinese food, but tastes notably different due to the use of various spices. Kind of in between Chinese food and Thai food.The Laksa is flavorful, and not overly spicy. Though you can ask for stronger spice level if you like the heat. The stir fry dishes are also excellent. Great portions too. 

I wish they would open every day. They are closed Mon-Wed but I understand those days are duds for the food industry. 

They do have a few tables for sitting but you're better off getting take out."}
{"text":"Very good place for Malaysian food the only downside is they have very limited seating 100% would recommend for a cheap but delicious meal be aware that the portion sizes are huge (and very addictive) I would do recommend the curry Lanka Char kway teow nd the Mee Goreng.  For ordering don't be worried there are pictures all over the walls  of the menu items and the owners are very understanding and will take the time to go over everything. Overall a very cozy atmosphere nice family run business"}
{"text":"Best Malay food place in GTA. The restaurant is quite small, only seat 10 people, more like a take-out place. But the food is unbelievable! . You have to try their Curry Laksa, Nasi Lamak and the weekend-only dessert! They only open Thurs-Sun. It is a very popular place and weekend waiting time can be easily 40mins+. It is recommended to call in advance to order (if you want the popular dessert, you really need to do it). The waiting is painful, but if you try their food, you will agree with me it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I am eating some Char Kway Teow from One2 Snacks. I first heard of this place in passing during a CBC's Metro Morning segment on Chris Nuttall-Smith, former Globe and Mail food critic. Believe it or not but I went that weekend even though it was on the other side of the GTA. One2 Snacks is more like a take out place than a restaurant - there is a small seating area with limited seats. Despite this, the place is always busy and this is indicative of how delicious the food is.

If this is your first time here, these three dishes are crowd-pleasers: 
CURRY LAKSA - Served in a large bowl with fish balls, shrimp, chicken, and bean sprouts. The curry broth is the highlight of the dish. This is a MUST-TRY item on their menu. I've tried the Singapore Laksa at Restoran Malaysia and it doesn't even compare. 

CHAR KWAY TEOW - Spicier, tastier version of Beef Chow Fun Noodles (Gon Chow Ngau Ho). 

MEE GORENG - This dish is a wet noodle with tofu, tomatoes, chilis, shrimp and meat. It keeps great for leftovers.

Each dish has a range of spiciness from mild to extra spicy to suit your tastes. I recommend getting the mixed noodles to try for each dish, whenever possible. They are cash only but the prices are very affordable. Do not come here hungry because you have to wait about 30 ridiculously long minutes - they only feel that way because you won't want to wait any longer to stuff your face. There is only one person running the front but he is accommodating and helps with recommendations."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for many years now, albeit not very often. Its a tiny takeout joint with probably enough seats for 8 customers max to dine in. The menu is small and the English phonetic spelling of food in malay. 

My favourite dish is probably the char kay teow, the stir fried brown noodles with shrimp, egg, green onion and bean sprouts. I usually get half flat rice noodles, and half round egg noodles to make things a bit more unique. The portion is good, and it just has this hearty flavour that makes you want to keep eating haha. 

I also love the kuih dadar, which is essentially pandan crepes filled with caramelized coconut and rolled into a burrito shape. The crepe is light and fluffy and the coconut has a slightly burnt, sharp taste (in a good way of course). 

My advice is to order ahead; call or email a day before because it gets really packed on the days it does open. It will always be a Scarborough food favourite."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon, was not busy when we got in but the place quickly filled up with people!

This is predominantly a take out place - there is some seating but very minimal and it's a tight space to eat. 

Took 18 mins to get our order, just a heads up

Here's what we ordered:

Mee Goreng (extra spicy) - 10/10
-amazing dry soft noodle that is very tasty and spicy 

Curry Laksa (extra spicy) - 9/10
-really nice watery curry with chicken and shrimp 
-comes with noodles

Chili Padi Chicken with Nasi Lemak - 8/10
-smaller portion but tasty 
-it's an oily curry that is chicken stir fried with some soft vegetables 

Good value for your money, very authentic taste, and a lot of delicious spice"}
{"text":"as a Malaysian I can say that this place has really authentic Malaysian street food and it's REALLY GOOD. There aren't many places to sit and the food took a long time but honestly, the food was so good it was all worth it. Portions were large and most customers are like family to the owners it was so cute."}
{"text":"I ordered Char Kwey Teow with extra egg, at about 11:45 am lunch time, and there were many people, and the food took about 20 minutes to be served. The portion size was huge and the taste is really close to what you you can get from Malaysia."}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find but the food here is really great. I got the curry laksa and it was tasty and flavourful. The portion is also quite large for the price you pay. 
There's little to no seating here so it's more suited for takeout, but if you're ever in the area it is definitely worth dropping by."}
{"text":"***2 thumbs up!!***
I absolutely love the food from this \"authentic\" family owned Malaysian restaurant!!!
The food variety available from this home grown restaurant is very impressive.
Ever since I'd discovered this little secret place. I just can't stop going back for more.

It is great that they do catering. Last Chinese New Year, I'd ordered the Pineapple tarts, Almond cookies, Kuih Loyang and Wu Tow Koh for gifts and some for myself and visitors. Every sweets where literally inhaled  by myself and visitors in less than week. 
This Christmas, I'd ordered party size, Chicken Satays (100 skewers), KL Hokkien Mee, Kuih Sago (Pink & Green), Kuih Dadar, Mee Siam and Ondeh Ondeh. With no surprise, the food that I brought were wiped cleaned....hehehe :)
I had so much compliments and I felt so proud, though I didn't cook up this meal.
My New Years Eve party with friends, I brought Durian Serimuka, Kuih Serimuka, Pulut Panggang and Chicken Satays, and again, everyone asked where did I get these delish dishes from.
Whenever I visit them for a sit in meal, I will order, Char Kway Teow, Nasi Lemak, Wat Tan Ho and Loh Meen (must eat it with the malt vinegar)...MMmmmmmmm.....bring back memories back in Singapore :D
In addition, I do love Appam Balik (sweet corn or peanut&coconet), but they are discontinued...how sad.

That said, if you are looking for an affordable, friendly and homely environment, I strongly recommend One2 Snacks...this is the place to be :)

Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Got take out twice this week, for the family,  not a thing we don't like. It was all amazing and cheap."}
{"text":"This is the best Malaysian food I've found so far. I've gone here so many times and the consistently deliver authentic Malaysian food. I especially like their nasi lemak. 
The service is a bit slow though but the guy at the front is support nice."}
{"text":"What I missed in Malaysia ? Char Kwey Teow, hey seems like old times, yes ! Now I know where to get my favorite Malaysian dish. Next in line Curry Laksa."}
{"text":"Learned about this place thru a Globe and Mail article which highlighted lesser known spots in the East End. It lived up to the hype. If Malaysia is \"truly Asia\" then this was authentic street food. What stood out for me was the time that it took to cook each dish. You could that they were not just mass-producing all the dishes. By the time I got there, half the dishes were sold out at 2PM on a Sunday! My only suggestion is for this family to diversify into the food truck business and bring their awesome food to the downtown streets. They would make a killing!"}
{"text":"Awww man! The delicious aromas that greet you at the door is absolute torture when you have to wait for your order to be made!

Tiny hole in the wall place but there's a constant flow of walk in customers and call in orders. Standard wait time time during a busy weekday lunch rush is 30-45 minutes! There are only two cooks but you can see them furiously clanging away at the woks with flames occasionally reaching the overhead vents; I kid you not, look through the kitchen doorway and see for yourself. 

Very limited weekday menu which expands during the weekday. Looking at the food pictures on the wall helped me decide on the Char Kay Teow medium spicy with a mix of flat and yellow noodles, and Curry Laksa medium spicy with a mix of vermicelli and yellow noodles. 

If you don't have a problem with claustrophobia, you can always dine in. There's counter seating for about four with tiny kiddie size stools, a teeny tiny table with 2 regular stools and a long, narrow table  by the window with four tall bar stools.

I was STARVING by the time my order was ready so hubby and I ate in the car; at least we had more room there. Wow! Spice levels here are hotter than other places (they have an extra spicy level that they describe as Sri Lankan level spicy). Good thing Annie's Tea House was close by, I grabbed an ice cream shake to cool things down.

Delicious fast food quality (not fast food speed hence 3 stars) Malaysian food. Best to call in ahead of time or run errands or grab a bubble tea while you wait."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place! The business must be really good for them, since they are CLOSED Monday to Wednesday and close around 7PM (most people's dinner time)

There is a very small seating area, it's mostly for take-out only.

and most of the stuff, especially desserts are available on the weekend only! If you haven't been here before, I suggest you come on a weekend, so you can try more stuff.

Very good authentic Malaysian food for take out."}
{"text":"It's like walking into a Travel Agency.  Malaysia destination posters align the walls along with photos of some colorful Food selection.  The Menu is affordable(!) while having plenty of selection of Malaysian Snacks & Hawker's Delights that made you wish you can book a Flight Ticket right away.

Actually One-2-Snacks is part of Malaysiakitchen.ca(along with MATRADE) promotes Malaysian products/services, foods/culture across Canada starting with Toronto, Ottawa & Vancouver.  You might recognize some of the other participating restaurants in the GTA that help this cause; Restoran Malaysia, Villa Malaysia, Matahari Bar & Grill.

The space and setup reminds me of the Curry Fishball Stalls at Pacific Mall but here I would say it has uniqueness as some items are not commonly found regularly.  Even the Curry Fish Balls(5pc/skewer $1.50) has the Malaysia style Curry Sauce.  They note that everything is made fresh and apologize in advance as it takes time to prep, so be patient and grab one of the handful of stools.   3.5 *Star*

Chicken Satay w/Peanut Sauce(4 Skewers $3.99)
Appam Balik(Crispy Crepe) - (Peanut & Coconut $1.25)
Curry Puff($0.80)

Definitely represents Malaysia well and who doesn't love Snacks or Hawker foods anyways.  Too bad they don't have Teh Tarik(Restoran Malaysia does).  As a Food first, Decor second casual-comfort wearing person that's VALUE oriented, One-2-Snack works all the right angles."}
{"text":"I loved my visit! The guy at the front is super polite and courteous! That starts my experience out to be excellent - it was super crowded with people that were eating, being really devoted to their food - you know that's a good sign! Ha ha 

Everything looked amazing and since it was my first time he helped me with my order - had the char kway teow - spicy with mixed noodles - it was amazing! Loved the atmosphere and felt special because I got a seat to eat if there. Saw lots of regulars come it which was nice. I got take out for my friends to give them a taste of what they missed. It's my new regular hangout ;)

Cant wait to go back and try the other dishes :)"}
{"text":"Tiniest place. Super cramped. Really odd hours. Really authentic food.

Highlights:

Like all of their desserts, especially their steamed durian glutinous rice one. Delicious durian cream/paste/filling on top with a slightly salty glutinous rice. Sweet and salty and incredibly durian flavored. Oh so good. And cheap too. I think it's like $1.10 or something a piece? Get here early though! Weekends only and most of their desserts are usually sold out by 3:00pm. Side note for desserts. You can order their steamed desserts even when the store isn't open. You have to order the entire steamed container though (40 ish pieces). We've done it before. Boxes and boxes of durian goodness. So much love there. Pre-order though, days if not a week in advance.

Durian milkshake - only available in the summer. Also incredibly durian flavored and very well priced. I'm sensing a theme here.

Laksa - I'm not a fan of their roti or their curry chicken, but One2Snacks introduced me to laksa with two kinds of noodles. It makes for an awesome mouth feel.

Cheung fun - steamed rice noodle rolls served covered in a sweet sauce. Also included in the mix are an assortment of fish balls and some pieces of bean curd sheet. Makes for a good substantial snack or light meal.

Side note: Bryan, who is usually at the counter, is super friendly. He's also the one who will be the one to break your heart and tell you there aren't any desserts left. =("}
{"text":"My second time having Malaysian food.  I got the Mi Goreng.  Unfortunately, they didn't have the curry.

Food: 3/5, I got it mild but it was waaaay too spicy. It was good but I would have preferred less spice as I couldn't enjoy it as much (threw away about half)

Service: 3/5, the guy working in the front was nice but had to keep saying what wasn't available lol.

Ambience: 2/5, just a take out joint with an area with maybe 5 people to eat in. 

Price: 4/5, super cheap, less than $10 per meal."}
{"text":"Oh man, what can I say about this place. I used to live in Kuala Lumpur when I was young, and since my family is based in northern China, we have an indescribable love for noodles. So, of course, one of my favourite dishes is Char Kwey Teow. After coming back to Canada (Vancouver), I tried all the restaurants that had char kwey teow but none of them was like what I used to have in KL. 

Last year, I moved to downtown Toronto for school. I first tried all the Malaysian restaurants in downtown for char kwey teow, but most of them were either super expensive, or the portions were small, or even worse, both. Then I went around the GTA for char kwey teow; most of them were kind of greasy and the portions are too small too. Then, as I was about to give up, I went on Yelp and found this restaurant. So I drove forty minutes here and ordered my first box of char kwey teow and nasi lemak here. Big mistake; since I didn't call in earlier, I had to wait for about two hours. I got the flat non-spicy noodles for about $7, which was very cheap compared to other restaurants. I ended up eating lunch at the food court right next to it and took the food home for dinner. 

Oh my goodness. The char kwey teow had the exact same taste as the ones I used to eat when I was young. It's juicy, flavourful, and just the right amount of greasy. It also had fish cakes and chicken with tendon and a LOT of shrimp. Oh boy. I was so happy. And the portion was HUGE; I could eat it for two meals! The nasi lemak was great too with a lot of sambal ikan billis. Boy oh boy. I was filled with so much goodness. 

Since then, I've been going back every week for char kwey teow and nasi lemak. Sometimes it takes more than 30 calls to get through, but be patient! It's definitely worth it. Brian is super patient, nice, and courteous. If you love fried noodles, coconut rice, or any sort of authentic Malaysian food, definitely check this place out. I'll be returning every week (until I learn to make such good char kwey teow) :))) Their desserts (kuih) are delicious too, even though I sometimes I have no idea what they are made of :p

Remember to call ahead!"}
{"text":"I'm slowly making my way through the noodle menu and at the halfway mark it will be a challenge since my go tos of laksa and or char kuew tiew are hard to resist.

I could not care less about the small seating area, long waits, or periodic selling out of dishes. This place is a treasure."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Call in advance to order or else you'll be waiting at the counter for a loooong time. 

They really should open Mon Tues and Wed though, and move to a bigger location and hire some more staff. The lineups and the long wait are a bit of a deterrent sometimes."}
{"text":"After reading any this place in Postcity magazine, I had to come try it. Made our way there one Sunday afternoon and it was packed! Properly warned that the wait for food will be 60 minutes, this does not make us go away as we made the trek here already. It also doesn't make the other loyal faithfuls, as orders continue to come in.

So we order, the nasi lemak, the keoy teow, and the laksa. And cause we hungry, we get an order of yam cake to eat now cause 60 minutes is a long time.

These guys constantly work. Orders like in and no time to answer the phone. These guys hope they ate a lot to begin the day cause there is no stop all day. I didn't leave till 330 and orders still coming in for lunch. They are super nice about it, let you know before waiting to order.

So the laksa, ate it there was super big, enough for like two. Mild was hot enough!! It tastes delicious.

The keoy teow, it has the smoky flavor, the charcoal flavor. I like. The nasi lemak, plenty of fishy smell!!

I'd definitely come back, food was great, prices are super cheap. Only thing is, the wait could be super long. And there isn't anywhere to wait except go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite spot for Malaysian food! Prices are cheap, portions are big, and flavour is out of this world!!!

All their dishes are great, but the one that stands out above the rest is their Laksa! Remember to call in ahead of time to eat in on their tiny tables or for take out."}
{"text":"This store serves some of the best malaysian food in Toronto. Their Chow Kway Tew, Mee Goreng and Curry Laska are my favourites. They have this durian cake that they sell only on the weekends and it tastes amazing. The wait is very long (at least an hour wait - from ordering to getting food). But you can tell they are doing their best - just too many orders coming in!! The guy in the front is extremely polite and nice and he always gives explainations and recommendations for those who are unfamiliar with their menu items. You can also call in your order ahead of time (even a day before), but they are so busy that they don't pick up their calls most of the time and their voicemail is always full. Regardless of the wait, this place is a definite must-try for those who enjoy Malaysian food:)"}
{"text":"It's much harder to find than it may appear, tucked in a strip mall that's actually off of a main road. And yet year after year its popularity is way too big to fit in the tiny store that houses One2 Snacks. 

Purveyor of cheap Malaysian street foods in Toronto, the restaurant is so small you can barely squeeze 6-8 folks dining in their equally tiny tables and window bar. I mainly saw people downing bowls of their popular curry laksa. I tried the Hokkien Mee mixed noodles, it was alright, heavy on the soy sauce and salt. It sure was an awful lot of noodles for the price, rare eh? The young guy fronting the family business kept a positive composure.

As representative of the global diversity of food found in the inner suburbs may be, weekends I discover quickly means long waits, like even an hour long. I guess it's a good idea to call ahead, if only you know already what to order.

[TTC: Sheppard East buses to Glen Watford Drive, which is one light east of Midland.]"}
{"text":"I LOVE THE FOOD!!   I must have ordered everything.  I had the chicken satay, pandan crap, haw fun, char tway, nisi curry dish and one of each of the desserts (but some was sold out).  I had to admit, the service was slow and they should really look into adding 1 for the front and 1 for the kitchen or a way to improve service.  They are losing sales.  I must have saw 8 orders walk away during my time there."}
{"text":"Based on all the good reviews, I ventured out and tried their Char Kway Teow, Mee Goreng, and Curry Laksa on different days.

The Char Kway Teow was terrible - zero star. I did not even bother to eat much of it. It had a very strong melted styrofoam smell and taste. I think it was caused by the food or oil being too hot when they placed the stir fry noddles into the styrofoam container. You could tell the container was a bit deformed by the heat too. Seriously, they should not use styrofoam containers since they are not meant to contain extremely hot food. It is not safe for human consumption for sure.

On the other hand, the Mee Goreng did not have this problem since they are smart enough to place an aluminum foil on the bottom of the styrofoam container. There was just a little bit of melted styrofoam smell and taste on the small top part where the aluminum foil did not cover. I just threw that part away and the rest tasted great. 4 stars. I wondered why they did not do that for the Char Kway Teow.

The curry laska was the best. Great laska/coconut favour as if you have it in Malaysia. 4-5 stars. I will be back for their laska for sure.

I hope they will fix their styrofoam container problem. I did notice a lot of people bring their own glass containers for them to put their ordered food in. I should have taken a hint. The wait could sometimes be well over an hour so be aware if you are in an extreme hunger mood."}
{"text":"TIP: They are NOT kidding about the spice level. I love spicy food, but even medium was was way too spicy for me.

I think this is one of the only places in Toronto that has Laksa, and it's really good. It's the only thing on the menu that I have tried so far, but I'm really looking forward to going back. The bowl of noodles was HUGE, I was so full after 3/4ths of it I couldn't finish it.

One2 Snacks is a super tiny take out place with room for maybe 10 people to sit max, so if you have a large order or a group of friends, it is better to call in to order take out and then go pick it up. I think they make each order as they receive them, so it takes a while to get your food as it does get super busy.

Definitely worth checking out if you're craving Malaysian food."}
{"text":"I have not had Char Kway Teow so greasy. It is soak in oil and plenty of MSG. This place is cardiologist's best friend. I can feel my blood vessels are plugged with oil droplets now.
Next time I am going to request less oil and no MSG.

Try their rice wrapped in pandang leav, $1.35 each, very tasty. 

While waiting for your food, go to Ho Ho Ho right across from One2 Snacks. Ho Ho Ho sells fish ball by the pound. They also sell curry sauce ($4.50) so you can make your own curry fish balls at home. Once you tried Ho Ho Ho  you will never pay those over priced fish balls at shopping mall."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here whenever I crave Kway Teow ! I give this place a high rating because of the prices. The prices are amazing for what you can get. I've usually order the Kway Teow since I love this dish. Then I usually get a side such as the chicken satay skewers or the curry puffs. The curry puffs are mainly potatoes in a puff but I enjoy the curry taste. The noodles are great though and I get the Kway Teow every time. Excellent prices and big portions !"}
{"text":"This place is a wow! In the good way, the price-value of the food is really really good, yes the place is a little hard to find but here is my experience: I called them with 30 min to place my order I got lost between the stores of the mall and I call them to verify where they were located, even with indications I was struggling to find the place so I called again the young guy very kindly took some of his time to get out of the store and find me and took me to the restaurant. I call that good service."}
{"text":"Got there today (Sunday) around 2:30pm.....super busy place. Non-stop phone calls, and people coming in and out to place orders and picking up.
We ordered the Char Kway Teow and the Curry Laksa. Was told it's going to take 20 mins for everything. While waiting we noticed nearly everyone is getting those layered cakes. And slowly one by one got sold out. So we grab the Kuih Talam and Kuih Dadar while we still can. Seems like these cakes are only available on weekends and usually sold out around 1pm.
The Laksa is very good while the Char Kway Teow is average.
Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday afternoon, the place isn't hard to find at all, just at the corner inside the plaza but fairly small place. There are approx. 12 seats where you can dine in if you decide not to take out. Menu is fairly small as well, half the menu is only offered on the weekends, thus not too much to choose from during the week.

I ordered the curry laksa (in which you get a choice of noodles, vermicelli or egg noodle or both if you like a mixture) and the chee cheong fun (which consists of fishballs, sweet tofu and beancurd sheets). You get to choose the level of spiciness in both dishes. The laska had chicken meat and some bean sprout in it. 

The wait time was around 10mins given there was no other customers than us. At the side stand, you can help yourself to some tea, condiments as well as utensils

The laksa was very flavorful and rich, the chicken wasn't dry at all and i got medium spiciness which was perfect for a little kick. The chee cheong fun was a very good snack yet pretty filling. For the price you pay and the amount of food and food quality, it was definitely worth it! 

Would highly recommend if you're in the area for some quick food or simply cheat eats!"}
{"text":"My mom told me about this little gem.
My favorite is the Laksa. It's a small little take out restaurant one would not usually notice. They have a bar style table and customers would sit single file along the table in high chairs. Think capacity is like 8 people. It's really small and tight. Most of their business is take out. The line is always out the door. Well the 3 times I've been by. I see people come with their own pots to order the Laksa.  I have not tried anything else but thus far it's excellent. Better than Gourmet Malaysia just around the corner on Sheppard."}
{"text":"I had the curry laska and the chicken satay, both are a must try for anyone that goes there."}
{"text":"Gotta take the bandaid off real quick and say that this was not the best Malay/Singaporean food I've had in the GTA, just being honest. But boy is it cheap, and that makes the food more delicious! 

We got:

Char kuey tiaw - when you cook rice noodles at a really high heat (or anything really) you can taste the heat of the wok--and that's the key to any amazing Asian street food. This place got it right! However, they could have upped the seasoning... It was a tad bland. (3.5/5)

Laksa - deeeeeeelicious, was totally craving a bowl of this coconut-y rich soup noodle goodness. A good dish to share with friends, because too much of this may give you a food hangover from all the oil. (3.75/5)

Wat tan hor fun - SUPER tasty! It's charred rice noodles with a creamy egg sauce and they do it goooooood. This was probably the best of all the dishes and I would order this one again in a heartbeat (4/5)

You know, some places are cheap and the quality of the food pays for it. Other places are hella delicious but forces you to take a second mortgage on your home. This place wins for their taste to price ratio! Best deal on this side of the GTA."}
{"text":"Awesome food in a nondescript plaza at midland and sheppard. Limited seating but super friendly staff who took the time to explain to this first timer. Flavourful, fresh ingredients and a super simple menu. 

Price was spot on and thankfully we got there at the right time because 2 mins after we arrived there was a line up out the door."}
{"text":"This place doesn't fuck around.  The lack of fuckery here is rare.

Just a hole in the wall joint run by the same family offering made to order Malaysian takeout from an unremarkable Scarborough strip mall.  There are some small tables and stools, but that's it.

It's a small menu (been here about 3 times, still working my way through the menu - have yet to try the weekend only dishes) and everything I've had has been excellent.  The laksa (which is incredibly easy to fuck up) is one of the best I've ever had and the char kway teow is damned near perfect -- not too dry and excellent hit of heat.  For some of the dishes, they offered a free upgrade to half egg noodle and half rice noodle, which gives you a nice texture contrast.

Being as good as they are and staffed by the same family, it gets busy.  It's a steady stream of takeout phone orders and Chinese aunties and uncles floating around.  Oh - in case the clientèle didn't give it away, it's really cheap too with most dishes around $6 - $7.  At this price point, you are usually dealing with pre-made 'Chinese' food served in metal troughs warmed by heat lamps. 

With all this, you would expect service to be curt, bordering on rude.  But the cashier is a true gentleman.  Offering suggestions and helping those unfamiliar with Malay cuisine.

That said, don't come here expecting them to be able to bend over backwards for you.  While huddling over and enjoying my eat-in meals here - I heard \"No - sorry -  we can't make that dish mild - it comes spicy or extra spicy.  Please try something else.\"  I dig that level of purism -- basically, \"No, we will not dumb down the dish, you plebian.\".  However, they were able to accommodate the lady's vegetarian restriction with some off-menu modifications.  Firm, but fair.

Even when we ignore the value here, the food is some of the best Malay I've had.  And the service and decor is everything you need and nothing you don't.  Is it any wonder that I try to find any excuse to pop by the area so I can grab something from One2 (*ahem* three into the four)?"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood favorite, the kind that you want to keep secret but has gotten super popular due to the quality of the food and service. To set expectations, this is a hole-in-the-wall (my favorite kind) run by a family (very nice son manning the busy front) which is open on very specific days (closed mon-wed) that does a handful of dishes (all very good). 

I've recently had the Laksa, Char Kway Teow, and a selection of their desserts again. They haven't skimped on quantitiy or quality over the years and continue to be absolutely delicious. Everything comes out piping hot with alot of 'wok air'. I keep coming for the Laksa which is too spicey for me (even on mild) but too delicious to give up completely. A solid recommendation!

Be warned that the space is very small and cramped if you are eating in. Also, its very popular and may take up to 30-45 minutes during peak hours to get your food due to the amount of orders. I would advise to call in earlier and do pick-up. I am very impressed by their service. I don't know how the son keeps such a cordial and kind demeanor inspite the crazy amount of orders and customers."}
{"text":"I have eaten their food for 3-4times. Travelling using ttc took 1,5hour for mouth watering comfort food. I love their nasi lemak with chili padi chicken and char kwe tiao. Everytime we came, either line up was so long or no line up but the order coming out in 1hour  coz everyone order by phone. Their business hour also short as i remember they close at 7 and only open for 4days ? Whatttt!!!! You should open everyday so everyone who is craving malaysian food can buy it everyday."}
{"text":"Very good, highly recommend this place. Only complain is the food is slight oily. Msg is on the lower scale. If you want to try their dessert, come early on Saturday or it'll be sold out by noon"}
{"text":"All of their dishes are top notch! Their rice cakes are soooooo good. The only downfall to the restaurant and why I am giving it 4 and not 5 stars is that they are so popular you have to order way in advance if you want food. Have showed up last two times and it was a 1 hour plus wait for eat in or takeout (I still waited)"}
{"text":"Yummy! Very good food! Very friendly staff. The place is very small, but the food amazing! We ordered their 3 signature dishes and all of them are really good. This place is definitely recommended. The price is excellent very cheap! You should definitely go try their food!"}
{"text":"Within a week of returning from Kuala Lampur, I found myself with a desperate craving for some KL Hokkien Mee and made my way here as quickly as possible. If you're looking for delicious, authentic Malaysian cuisine, this is the place. The menu is small, as is the space inside (with limited seating), and they're only open from Thurs-Sun, but this place is definitely worth a visit.
The Hokkien Mee is on par with the ones I tried in KL during my visit, and can even be made with chu yau cha on request! (BELIEVE ME, this is one request worth making!) The Wat Tan Hor is also delicious, noodles cooked perfectly in an egg sauce. Also love the chicken curry (creamy and flavourful) with the roti canai (perhaps not AS good as in Malaysia, but it's close; light with a little bit of a crunch) - no matter what you order, you can't really go wrong here.

The service here is incredibly slow, so be ready to wait for your food, and there really isn't much room to wait. If you're planning to eat in, seating is limited but there's also free (self-serve) tea/water. 

There is no better place for Malaysian cuisine in Toronto. Trust me."}
{"text":"Dropped in to see if I could pick up an order of fried noodles and upon seeing the store just as dirty as I remembered it, I walked out.  

Seriously people, does hygiene not play a roll at all in what you eat as long as it tastes good?  That's just sad.  I won't be back.  EVER."}
{"text":"I come here only for their curry laksa, that's it!

The wait can be very long.  6 seatings inside.  If you see one one, grab it.  Clean the table before eating.  

Another alternative:   Take out is also feasible.  Eat the laksa in your car, while it is piping hot.

Desserts are only on weekends."}
{"text":"4.5 stars
I really love this place and once again I'm here because of Jennifer K's review. I have been here 2 times in the last week. It was so good the first time that I had to have more. So far I have tried the seafood curry laska, mee goreng, chicken skewers and some kind of coconut dessert. Portions are very generous, quality of the ingredients are top notch and the resulting taste is best of all. 

-Curry laska - WOW!!! flavors galore. 
-Mee goreng - mmm; mmm good. 
-Chicken skewers - great by themselves BUT heaven when paired with the peanut sauce (I drizzled the extra sauce over my mee goreng noodles....lol)
-The coconut dessert which I'm not even gonna try to pronounce was very interesting and tasty and a great change from the typical cake type desserts I always inhale 

The only reason I take off 0.5 stars is that I wish the place was a little bigger like an actual restaurant instead of just a takeout place and I wish the food could be made a little bit faster (Typical wait time is about 10min even when its not too busy). However, if this takes away from the quality of the food  then I take that back. At least you know the food is gonna be fresh and done right.  

I will definitely be back for more skewers with peanut sauce. I'm sure I could hammer like 20-30 skewers if my wallet allowed for it. Too bad I'm just gonna have to spread it out into 3-4 visits but I wish I could have it all in one sitting."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall, is the most accurate description I can think of for this place. Inside there is a small table in front of the cash register and some along the side wall facing outside. Don't expect to eat here comfortably, it is not meant for that, but if you don't mind being uncomfortable for a little bit I promise the food is worth it.

I ordered a few of the chicken skewers, curry laksa, and some char kway teow. The chicken is marinated and grilled well and the peanut sauce only made it that much better. For $1 these skewers are above and beyond.

Curry Laksa is simply a spicy rice noodle dish with some tofu, fish balls, and some pork. The soup was well balanced, spicy but not too spicy that it was uncomfortable. Extra points for not having curry powder residue in the soup. Nothing worse then drinking a spoonful of spices that stick to your tongue. 

Char Kway Teow aka Stir Fried noodles tasted great aside. They let you choose from 3 different types of noodles or combine them all. The portion size was generous and it simply isn't all noodles. It had a good amount of beef, bean sprouts, green onions, and eggs. 

You can choose the spice level for most of the dishes.......don't kid yourself into thinking you can handle the spiciest level. I made that mistake for you already. If you never had Malaysian food, I think this is one of the best places to start."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place. The food is amazing! I was recommended by an uncle and he was right, the food taste good, the portion is huge, and definitely a hidden gem.

Tips: go early if you want to try their menu. Normally only the noodles are left if you go around 4 pm. As for desserts, go in the morning on the weekend or call to get them to save you a couple the day before. If you go during the afternoon on a weekend it's all gone.

The only down side is they open only thurs- Sunday and the seating area is quite small. But that won't stop me from going!!"}
{"text":"I would never have found this place on my own. It was recommended to me one day when I was raving about Restoran Malaysia in Richmond Hill.

This is a no frills, quick snack bar where you can sit, but lots of people just come for takeout. Today I needed a quick meal to go.

I decided to try the Wat tan hor, one of their three signature dishes. Saucy smoky rice noodles, what could go wrong? It was huge and I will have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. The proprietor was concerned that I might not like the texture of the dish. I asked him to compare to a popular Asian dish and he mentioned one of my favourites, so I told him it would be fine. It was delicious.

$7 was good because it is cash only and my wallet was running really light on cash when I walked in.

The place just smells delicious and the proprietor is very friendly. No idea where the washroom is. I thought they were required by law. Must be behind the employees only sign."}
{"text":"I had the curry laksa with chciken and shrimp and a really spicy broth. The noodles were perfectly cooked the space is really small i assume people get take out most of the time. It is a family runner restaurnat and I appreciate that the owner told us which dishes had pork in them so that was very nice of them. Really good food"}
{"text":"I have been going here since their grand opening. Brian is always a pleasure to chat with, food is mouth watering good, great prices, what more do you want? Tip for those that are thinking about going for the first time:

1. Call to order ahead of time. If not, you could end up waiting over an hour for your food. 

2. Be wary of the spice level. I can handle spicy foods and I usually opt for medium. 

3. Cash only."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Authentic food  the staff are super friendly and they really take time to explain their food. The people that goes yo this store are super nice as well you get that good vibe from everyone."}
{"text":"I'm from Malaysia.  This is just ok.  The best you can get in Toronto for the price, I guess.   I question the freshness.  I ordered the roti canai, curry laksa, and satay.   Curry for the roti canai was good.  But nothing out of the ordinary.  Roti tasted like crepe batter - too doughy.   Flavour was there, but it's not like back home.  Curry laksa ~ good curry soup base ~ but the fried tofu and fish balls is not how it is in KL.  They put chicken in there and the chicken tasted like it has the freezer smell.  Last but not least, the chicken satay ~ the chicken was tender, the sauce not authentic peanut sauce like the ones in Malaysia ~ but still ok.   No cucumbers or onions on the side to clean the palate.     I came on a weekday so lots of dishes weren't available.   Also the wait for take out is too \"loooonngggg.\"   In Malaysia, all these foods I ate are considered quick street food; and given their \"take-out\" style environment, I would expect quicker service.  Would I be rushing to come back again?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Malaysian food.  I went around 3:30pm on a Saturday and only had to wait about 15 min to order.  The food took maybe 20-30 minutes, but so worth the wait!  Chicken satay was hot and fresh off the grill served with peanut sauce.  Moist and tender.  I ordered the laksa (mild), which was spicy enough for me. If you can handle the heat, you could probably go medium.  My friend ordered the char way teow and it was really good.  Mild is not spicy enough. If you like hot, you have to go at least medium.  Roti canai is only available Thursdays and Fridays.  Now I need to go back on a Thursday or Friday."}
{"text":"This place is small so be prepared to wait for a spot or even your order. We arrived at 1pm on a Sunday and there was no space so we chose to take our food to go and eat in the car. It was soooooo worth it! Succulent chicken sate, the nasi lemak with dilis (coconut rice with sambal and small fried fish) was such comfort food! We also truer various deserts whose names I have forgotten. They were tasty enough. Their Char Kwey teow was just ok. We will be back for the laksa!"}
{"text":"911:  Hello 911, Please state your emergency.

Me: Yes 911, I would like to report drugs being sold.

911:  Where is this happening?

Me:  It's happening at One2 Snacks in Scarborough, they must be putting crack cocaine in their food because I can't get enough of it and am totally addicted!!!

Yes, gonna up it to \"5 STARS\".  YELP's definition indicates that 5 Stars is basically the best you can get and you know what, I know I can't get better....I'm totally addicted to their food!

From their insane Laksa, Mee Goreng, Hokkien Mee, I can't stop myself!!!  I must try everything in their menu!  I've been going every week and can't say no anymore.. if this place was any closer I would have to commit myself!  Please someone help me!!!!!"}
{"text":"Students at Agincourt C.I. (Which was kind of a rival to my high school) Seem to have lots of options to skip the cafeteria in this strip mall, and One2 is certainly one of them. It's closed 3 of the 5 weekdays (be careful of this!), but Thursday and Friday there must be a lot of kids sleeping through algebra class in a carb coma. 

Today I got an order of laksa and a char kway teow (which I found similar to Thai \"drunken noodles\") for take out, and the laksa alone fed 3 adults! - absolutely huge portions, and as you can see from photos of the menu, huge value too.

I first heard of laksa after a lengthy discussion on chowhound (http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/928691), and it was nice to have a fresh version for comparison (PS - the packaged product is legit too, and if you can't get it in a supermarket, it's online - I got a case on Amazon in the U.S.). 

Would I recommend a visitor to downtown Toronto schlep all the way out here for noodles?  Probably not, but a visitor SHOULD get out to the burbs to experience the cultural and culinary diversity that is unmatched anywhere else, and so I give it the full 5 here on yelp. If you reside in Toronto, you need to go there for sure."}
{"text":"This place is tiny but big on flavors. We managed to cramp in a group of 5 since we came at an odd hour. Unfortunately they were out of a lot of stuff. Sounded like they mostly only have the noodle and rice dishes now. 

I had the nasi lemak with chili chicken. The chili chicken wasn't spicy but I really liked the flavor. The anchovies tasted great as well. My wife had the curry laksa. I probably had half of it. The portion size was almost big enough for 2 people and the curry was excellent as well. I would come back here just for this alone as this was probably one of the best curry laksas I have had outside of Asia. Also tried my friend's char kuey teow which wasn't bad but not a home run like the laksa.

Cash only. No bathroom. Though the food court a few doors down has one."}
{"text":"OMG you can get old waiting in line here for your food.  But when it comes ... it is authentic and just plain good.

They ran out of my favorite ikan bilis nasi lemak, but I decided to go with a good standard choice - LAKSA!  Mmmm.  Also bought a bunch of different flavored kuih -- in particular, the lapis is my personal fave - and the one with PANDAN ...

CALL AHEAD!!!!  The wait times are painful ... but the end result is worth it."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Cheap eat with large portions
- Everything tasted fresh
- Desserts were amazing!
- Lots of parking

Cons:
- Food was a bit bland
- Ordering take out can take a while. Took about 45-50 minutes for us to get our food
- Very little seating

Ordered:
$7 Char Kway Teow - It was good but not amazing considering other reviews
$7.25 Lasi Nemak w/ Curry Chicken 

Conclusion:
We went here based on reviews from several places. The place is tucked away in a plaza with lots of parking. The place was quite full when we arrived(12:30) so we had to wait around 10 minutes to order. When we did order, we had to wait 45-50 mins for our food which is way to long for takeout which was a huge turnoff. Theres very little seating inside, maybe about 8 seats. Overall the food was ok. I thought the Char Kway Teow was a little bland. There wasn't much flavour. Its was similar to Ho Fun at a Chinese place. The Lasi Nemak was also just okay. The desserts however were really good. I got the durian and coconut desserts and would come back for those. Overall I'm indifferent about this place. Its cheap, with large portions but lacks some flavour. They also need to improve the wait times for takeout. I'd probably only come back for the desserts."}
{"text":"I think this is one of our favourite new spots! They are extremely friendly and the food portion is huge and delicious! I've only tried 3 items on their menu, but I can't wait to try them all. Close by and convenient as well! Just be prepared for a longer wait since they are always busy (we really don't mind the wait - so call in beforehand to place your order!) I'm so hungry can't wait to eat"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal, authentic Malaysian food for great prices. 

Located in a strip plaza, this place is quite unassuming, with a couple of stools for dining in, I'd definitely call it a takeout place. I had heard good things from my Malaysian relatives and they were definitely onto something with this place. 

We ordered the char kway teow and the curry laksa as well as the curry puffs and everything was amazing. We did have to wait around 45 minutes for our food, but the gentleman at the counter told us to call in advance or even send them an email and let them know what time to pick up the food and they'll have it ready for us when we come in. He was very nice and has a true passion for what he does, I always like to see a restaurant that's really proud of their product. 

The food came out to around $24 and we had enough for 4 people I'd say, so lots of leftovers. The curry laksa had a beautiful broth, it was creamy, bright and super flavourful, it also came with lots of tofu, fish cakes and chicken as well as way more noodles than one person can eat. The char kway teow was also delicious, filled with grilled chicken, shrimp and fish cakes, the noodles were perfectly fried and this was also very flavourful, which was great as sometimes I find this dish to get kind of boring after a while but that's not the case with this one. Lastly the curry puffs were light and crispy, stuffed with a delicious potato curry filling, these make a great appetizer or snack food, I'd go back just for these, they were so yummy. 

Overall a great place. Stop going to those Thai/Malaysian/Chinese hybrid restaurants and get yourself an authentic Malaysian experience, the flavours are so intense and amazing, you won't be disappointed. 

Of note: Malaysians love spice so be careful with which spice level you choose, we had everything mild and still found there to be a bit of spice. I usually like spice so I'd go as far as medium spice but I imagine anything above would be very spicy! Also this is a takeout place and it tends to get quite busy, I'd recommend calling ahead, we will definitely be doing that next time or expect a bit of a wait, it's worth it though!"}
{"text":"This place is recommended by my Malaysian friend so I assumed it is authentic. 

This little store is always packed with customer no matter it was lunch time or later afternoon like 3nish. It can tell how popular it is. 

I have tried a few items and they are all yummy. 

Mee Siam - the rice noodles are cooked well, not greasy or choppy (cooked into pieces) or too soft. If you eat a lot of Chinese noodles, you will understand what I mean. 

Char Tway Teow - I opted for yellow noodles mixed with Tway Teow. I like yellow noodles better because they are very bouncy yet it is just my preference. 

Chicken satay - that is the best chicken satay I have tried so far. The chicken is juicy and with good grilled aroma. The peanut sauce is spicy with a little sweet taste. I can easily finish 20 pieces if it is AYCE. 

I also tried a few dessert. Since I love coconut, they are all yummy to me. Dessert usually sold out fast, so I have not tried all the dessert. My friend told me to go on Saturday early to guarantee getting the dessert. 

The wait is always 10-20 minutes depending on how many people already in line. However, the cashier is always polite and apologizes for the wait. Also, wait is bearable if I know yummy food is coming. 

The portion is always generous and price is fairly low. 

seating is an issue, but I usually enjoy the food at the Food Court in the same plaza. I wish they could expand to a bigger place though."}
{"text":"This place has great prices. I ordered the Char Kway Teow ($8) and it was such a large portion that I made 2 meals out of it. BEST DEAL EVER!

The service at this place is another factor that gave it its 5/5 rating. This place is extremely popular so there were a lot of people, but the young man fronting the store was friendly and patient. I was also very impressed by how detailed he was. A sit-down customer wasn't eating her meal, so he checked in with her to make sure everything was okay despite how busy he was.

Keep in mind that it's cash only here! Besides that: very ideal prices, delicious food, and outstanding service - I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I can't give this place a 5 star.  Food can be a little spicy but wow the flavours. There is a wait and the shop is tiny with very limited spots but the food is amazing. Will definitely come again but will call in advance. 

Had to wait 40 minutes but again it is worth the wait even when I was starving to eat lunch at 3 pm on Saturday. Staff was super friendly and open to explain if you had questions even when bombarded with things to do. 

Give this \"hole in the wall\" joint a try. It's a gem. Next time will try the laska and eat in, crazy yummy aroma while I stood and waited for my food."}
{"text":"Love this place and it truly reminds of Singaporean Malay food. Hands down best Laksa I've had in Toronto and they have weekend specials such as assorted coconut milk desserts and my favourite - Pulut Panggang (glutinous rice wrapped in banana leaves with shrimp filling)"}
{"text":"I am going to be here every day they open.

I stumbled upon this place and I know it doesn't look like much from the outside - but the food is hands down amazing.

The parking lot is a battle zone where the objective is to get a parking spot without hitting people that honestly walk without looking both ways OR ramming into cars that back out without looking.  

The food here is 100% (emoji).  I had the laksa curry and char something.

The laksa curry + vermicelli is around $8 and fills you up for the rest of the day.  It has bean puffs, fish balls, and chicken.  There is no curry powder that clumps up and messes up the dish.  This is hands down my fave fave fave fave.  

The char noodles is similar to beef flat noodles at Chinese restaurants but has a less oily quality.  They mix it with egg noodle and the texture is golden.  My boyfriend destroyed this dish before I really had a chance to eat more than 2 bites.

The only down part is the waiting time - but just order ahead and by the time you get there it'll be ready :)

CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THEY OPEN FOR THIS WEEK."}

This place can definitely called hidden treasure.  The price is great, food is excellent and service is great ( can't expect much) but they were trying the best to serve u.  We had laksa, this is the best in Toronto.  And we order the fried rice noodle with egg, they were perfect."}
{"text":"Curry laksa ($6.50)
This bowl of noodles was bigger than my face, definitely get your money's worth. Comes with chicken, tofu, sliced fishballs in both vermicelli and egg noodles with some veggies hiding at the very bottom. I'm not a fan of curry but i enjoyed this bowl of noodles - there was a strong taste of spice which slightly overpowered the curry so the curry didnt taste as strong.This laksa is perfect for a cold chilly day. I ordered the medium spicy which was really spicy for me already. The noodles were served boiling hot and with the heated spiciness, I guarantee you'll be sweating. If you are looking for some legit malaysian laksa, this is the hidden gem. Its a small take out place, and long line ups during lunch time. 

Char Quey Teow ($6.50) 
Stirred Fried Flat and Yellow egg noodles with Chicken, Fish Cake, Shrimp and bean sprouts. This is the legit malaysian version of the chinese dish ???. This was cooked really nicely, you can taste the \"wok hei\". It was really tastey and flavorful. I personally liked this dish more than the laksa. Big portion, good value.

Note they are closed monday to wednesday."}
{"text":"I came here based on great reviews. 
Not sure what the hype is all about. 

Limited seating, so better for take-out. 
Long wait times, as it's busy. 

I got curry Laksa. Too much noodles and not enough soup. 
If you don't eat fast, the noodles will soak up the soup and you are left with just NOODLES. 

I've had better Malaysian food elsewhere. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Family-run, take-out joint. Really friendly service from Brian at the counter. I highly recommend calling in the order and then picking it up. 

Their desserts! Most of which are only available on the weekends and sell out quickly. Kuih lapis in particular. I really like peeling the layers and eating them one by one. 

They open at 11 am, and if you're there at 2 pm looking for the desserts, you are so out of luck. And that's usually me. And yes, I know, Gourmet Malaysia sells Malay desserts on the weekends to go, too. (Thanks, but pass.) But, the ones at One2Snacks are so much better. If it's a special occasion or if I have the urge, I will wake up specifically to line up and have my massive dose of Malay desserts. Their Malay desserts are just that good. 

That said, if you place your order ahead of time or even email your order, Brian will set aside what you want for you. I have never actually tried this, but Brian tells me about this option every time I miss out. ....Which is so so so often. 

Noodles are their specialty. Many Yelp reviews go on about their Char Kway Teow. I think it's okay, but just that. Same goes for their other noodle dishes (Meehoon Siam, Mee Goreng, Hokkien Meen, Loh Meen). I can't say any of their noodles are what I call \"supremely-to-die-for-stellar.\" A decent deal and filling, but not what I would order from One2Snacks.     [Side note: I doubt most people or places can make any of these dishes to the impossible standard of how grandma used to make it. That and the nostalgia.]

Wat Tan Hor is a my favourite main dish from One2Snacks. It's a little bit saltier than I would like it to be, but I don't know anywhere else that makes it. Soupy, eggy, a couple of shrimps and balls. I also think their Curry Laksa and Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce are both pretty good too. 

So, to sum up. Come, if you can, for their desserts. If not, have their Curry Laksa, Wat Tan Hor, Chicken Satay. Also not mentioned, but would recommend: Nasi Lamak. I also like their Roti Canai (not available on weekends)."}
{"text":"When I watched the thin lady doing her Wok Thing to ensure nothing burns up, I was reminded of the old 80's song:  She works hard for her money.......

Honestly, this type of food is not my tastes but I can understand the many folks who crave this type of flavoring.  Vs going to an unhealthy McDonald's etc, this beats it w/ more flavoring.

Work ethics/courtesy:  5 stars all the way.  The young lad working the front has potential in his future, very polite and considerate, rare among today's youth.  The dynamic duo working the kitchen non stop, what more can anyone ask for in a small eatery, no?  5 Stars to them as well.

Food taste and flavoring:  3 stars

Ambiance:  1 star, this is strictly a take out place.  Try taking a date out here, lets just say good luck getting 2nd base afterwards."}
{"text":"This place is good for your taste buds and wallet! It's a hidden gem amongst the typical chinese 'restaurants' in the plaza. The Malaysian food is consistently yummy! I've had the curry laksa, char kway teow and loh meen (sorry for the spelling if it's incorrect). The desserts are also really really good!!"}
{"text":"Wow. We were in town for a conference and were near this tiny little Malaysian gem. It's a mom and pop in an Asian strip mall in Scarborough. Get the Char Kway Teow -- it's a heavenly noodle dish. Friendly staff, very helpful. They get very busy, so patience is key."}
{"text":"Authentic Malaysian Food at an affordable price? 

You need to come and check out One2 Snacks which is located in a small plaza in Scarborough. One2 Snacks is like a takeout place with around 4 seatings, most of the patrons are here for take out!

Nothing on the menu priced more than $5.99..Street snacks costs around $1... and same with their dessert $1 a piece but only offer during the weekend. 

Char Kway Teow ($5.99) includes a bottle of water 
- Stirred Fried Flat and Yellow Noodles with Chicken, Fish Cake and Shrimp 
- A popular street food in Penang, Malaysia which usually prepared in the street stall (hawkers) 
- Yummy.. I have this thing for flat rice noodle, so I am a little bias 
- The bean sprouts and chives were fresh and plentiful 
- Big Portion for the price! 

Grass Jelly Drink ($1.50) 
- What better than having a cold Jelly Drink while eating street food? (ok maybe a beer!) 
- Really light and refreshing with a touch of sweetness 

Roti, satay, crispy crepe, Hainanese chicken and a long list of traditional Malaysian dessert on the menu will ensure that I will be back really really soon to try them all out!! 

And with that price? I don't really need Lunch Specials!! 

Cash only!!"}
{"text":"See Johnson C's review. Everything he says is true. Love the chicken satay is the best. Really amazing. I'm also a fan of the char kway teow. Soooo good great prices. Great service. Have never been here on weekends to try the weekend menu options."}
{"text":"This place is my # 1 place for take-out Malaysia foods.

Price($) + taste(Yum yum) + portion(Huge) = 5 STARS!

The front staff is very friendly and patient.
The store is small and with around 10 seats for dine in.

I would definitely advise call ahead of time to shorten your waiting time.  Usually takes 30-45 mins for 3-4 items take-out.

Curry Laksa, Char kway teow and Mee Goreng are top three must try!  They have three spicy levels(Mild, spicy and extra spicy).  

Time to eat now ~ Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Not much to say here everyone pretty much said it.  Have the curry laksa it's really good!!!  

If u like laksa come here and get some now!!  It's that good. 

Now if they only had more seats...  The 6 tiny stools just doesn't cut it.  But oh well I'll live with it cause the food is excellent here."}
{"text":"One 2 Snack is a family operated take-out restaurant. The store sold a variety of affordable Kuala Lumpur-style Malaysian street food such as Char Kway Teow.

The aroma of durian evokes strong reactions for many - from profound appreciation to extreme disgust. More durian for us, pro-durianer.....power of Darwinism! One 2 Snack was almost sold out of durian cakes when we arrived. The cake consisted of a delicious layer of durian and a layer of dense glutinous rice cake. Glutinous rice added a subtle savoriness to the inherit sweetness of durian. While I did not mind the cake's density, it needed more durian. 

My favorite was the pulut panggang. I loved the flavor profile of this unique snack. The spicy dried prawns, fried coconut, and glutinous rice mixture were grilled in a banana leaf. The rice absorbed the aroma of the banana leaf. There were so many dimensions to this seemingly simple snack. I snatched a piece of pulut panggang with the most prawns and coconut!  I hope the staples used for the banana leaf wrap did not contain lead. If it did, this will be my last entry. Please bury me with some pulut panggang!

The Char Kway Teow was my mother's favorite. The wok was heated to the proper temperature; steam was coming out from the noodles for a good three to six minutes. It was stir fried with chives, fish cakes, chickens, eggs, shrimps, bean sprouts, flat rice noodles and yellow noodles. The dish was plentiful. It had the smoothness of flat noodles and the al dente texture of yellow noodles. The smell of the salted shrimp lingered in my house for the whole afternoon.

I enjoyed the wide range of flavors and the distinctive spiciness of authentic Kuala Lumpur Malaysian cuisine. Already planning my next visit to One 2 Snacks!"}
{"text":"Great price, great flavour, great portions. Great for fatties and foodies. Laksa and char Kwa Tew were very well cooked. The Stir fry is proper and has the smoky flavour that a lot of places don't."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem in scarborough like literally..
You have to call in for take out as it takes a while for them to prep the food and they don't really have any sitting area
But this place is amazing"}
{"text":"My parents brought home some takeout from this place. And it was very very delicious. As a person that grew up in Malaysia, I would say that this tastes like real Malaysian food."}
{"text":"As good as it can get this far from home.  All the flavours unique to Malaysia are here. 
nasi lemak, char kway teow, wat tan hor all hit the spot.  The curry is also very good, has the right flavour and I can taste curry leaves, scratches my curry itch every time!
  
Best of all are the kuih-muih (desserts), kuih dadar, kuih talam, kuih lapis, even kuih with durian.    
You can even find Malaysian style savoury taro cake (???) here, tasting just the way it's supposed to taste, and served with the right kind of chilli sauce.

If you are getting a made to order dish like the CKT or wat tan hor, do yourself a favour and ingest it on premises, don't ruin it by keeping them steaming in the container for another minute!"}
{"text":"I cant stop coming...here. Menu is really small but everything is good, right down to the desserts, which is only available on the weekends. Theres always a lineup so its kinda annoying if ur effing hungry. I always make sure to buy an extra order of my favorite dishes to go just in case theres a zombie apocalypse waiting to happen. I wish the place was bigger and the chairs larger so I can invite my fat friends. Waiting time is terrible but once u get ur food u forget all ur hardships."}
{"text":"We left home at 4am just so we could catch a late lunch at this place. So worth waking up early for!! We've tried going our past few visits only for it to be closed (mon thru wed). 
The lone guy behind the counter was swamped with orders and a line out the door but he was very friendly and pretty efficient.  We ordered curry laksa , char kway teow & a mifan setow. He tracks orders by telephone numbers and told us 30 to 40 minutes. That was fine we expected that and went and dropped off our stuff as we were staying nearby. When we got back our order was just finishing up and the guy was telling customers just coming in that they weren't taking anymore orders until 3:30 so they could catch up. Lucky us!!  The weekend only desserts went fast. Will need to try some the next time. 
We've had the same dishes at a food court in Markham and this by far is superior.  
It's a tiny place - mostly take out with space to eat in for at most 6 people. 
Oh and we had enough leftovers to actually take home with us to Boston. Sooo good :)
And glad we got it before their 2 week vacation time
Woo hoo!!"}
{"text":"Upon walking up to the doors, you would never guess this place, other than the loyal line ups , had great authentic Malaysian food. Looks are deceiving from outside.  This Eight seater restaurant is designed for take out.  Call your orders in ahead.  
       My favs are laksa spicy noodle soup.  Order it with half vermicelli half yellow round noodles. One of the best i've had, including Singapore and Malaysia. 
Hokkien mee noodles are super tasty and authentic.  Curry puffs are small n flavorful. 
Grass jelly drink is percect. 
This week I'll be trying their char kway teow and 
Nasi lemak.  
Can't wait to taste their kueh (dessert)"}
{"text":"Tasty chow kwai diu and curry laksa!!  Better call to pre-order, otherwise wait at least 30 mins or probably 1 house at busy hours."}
{"text":"It's a really hidden gem. I love the pulut panggang ( sticky rice roll with spicy source wrapped by banana leaf). The sea food and chicken laksa is always recommended. The owners family are really nice."}
