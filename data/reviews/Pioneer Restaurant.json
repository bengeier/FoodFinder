{"text":"Saddens me to drop a star but tonight's fish was not up to par. It was a different breading and not as good.   Service was almost bad, no refills on water, never received the beer we asked for, and never received the last refill of fish. The wife salad was just ok, they were out of blue cheese. I swear shit like this only happens when she goes with me there. LOL"}
