{"text":"Live entertainment as we were served beverages it was so much fun one if the best memories we had in Vegas! Jaw dropping!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night during happy hour 3-6 let me say it was amazing. We got the 5 o'clock somewhere drink it was amazing for 5 dollars and the lava shrimp for 6 dollars was just great. My mom had the fish tacos and I had the fish sandwich it was amazing We shared the sandwich the tacos. The tacos  I would get in a heartbeat. The sandwich was great as well but I liked the tacos a tad bit better. :)"}
{"text":"Hit and miss..hope to god you dont get seated under an a/c vent cause you will freeze! haha. the food is ok...ive had the chicken sandwich which was one of the best i have ever had, then ordered it again on a later visit and was very disappointed. The crab dip is really good, very cheesy. The best thing about this place is that if you order a drink and you dont like it, they happily swap it out with something else for you"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  reasonably priced drinks, bartender hooked it up in the tequila & sprite drink"}
{"text":"Rather than detail each item served lets just say they had a bad day as the service was slow and not very friendly or accurate with our orders and what was served was very poor at best. I might try again as I know they can do better from others I have been to. Everyone has a bad day once in a while. Sorry!"}
{"text":"This was the first place open serving food that was close by our hotel once we got settled in. We split an order of nachos, which were HUGE! The late night crowd was there, and they had the lights turned down and the music blaring. Not the atmosphere I expected."}
{"text":"Windy our server was amazing! I got two Perfect Margaritas and an order teriyaki boneless wings and everything was perfection. Be sure to ask for Windy next time you come in, she'll take care of you"}
{"text":"The first time I went, it was fairly crowded and I  really enjoyed it - because conversation was not on my agenda that night.    My subsequent visits have been when it was quieter - well, there were no people there but the music was as loud as it it had been when full.

We had service from two different people, one was a pleasant and speedy young man, the other from a woman who had delusions of her own importance in the greater scheme of things.   Why work in the service industry if you don't like people?  I don't get it!      We did not have a full meal, just drinks and appetizers and they were good.     

The ambience is great and having just returned from the Caribbean, it was rather nice to enjoy that atmosphere.    But we were driven out by the excessively loud music.     I have spoken to several people who have been there who no longer go as they say the music is always loud.  Daytime, nighttime, full of young people, empty of all but a couple of older people - the music is still excessively loud.     I wanted to go again and dragged a reluctant friend promising we would sit outside so it will be quieter :)    The music is as conversation killing outside as it is inside.   Perhaps it is the acoustics of the mezzanine - who knows."}
{"text":"Second star only because of the friendly staff. Went with my adult son. We started with the chicken quesadia. Actually quite a bit of meat and just enough for two. We both decided to go with a signature item the cheeseburger in paradise. Thus was horrible. We both agreed it tasted microwaved and not grilled. My son had recently eaten at Wahlburger and said it wasn't even close. In my mind Five Guys was better. No excuse for not being able to cook a premium burger. We talked with our waiter about this and he listened intently. A manager never stopped by to welcome us or check on us. Sunday afternoon with plenty of open tables."}
{"text":"12:15 on Saturday and the host at the entry was nice. I asked about a bar and they said only one was open and it was partially outside. Sat down at the bar and there was bird poop on counter. I asked the bartender for a rag to wipe it down and was told I don't have one. I took a napkin and cleaned it up and wrapped in another napkin to ensure it doesn't spread. I handed it to the bartender and her reply was \"wow you're handing me bird poop\". After asking two times for a rag I asked a different employee and 10 minutes later he wiped down the counter. He said it's because customers are sitting here prior to us opening so they are not able to clean it. There was my group and a couple at the bar when we arrived. The bar tenders are rude and acted as if we were an inconvenience to them the entire time. We spent $200 and were treated poorly."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times so far. I go for the atmosphere more that anything else. The food is OK at best and the prices are higher than I like. The nachos are awesome though. One o the few things on the menu that's reasonably priced and is very good. I do not get anything else. Great to share or eat alone."}
{"text":"Very fun and good food. Every time I come to Vegas I eat here."}
{"text":"Nachos was big and good... good for sharing.. me and my boyfriend shared one but just ate half of it even.. it's like $16"}
{"text":"Crap food but it is all about atmosphere! My kids had blast !! Stilt walkers doing balloon animals and a dance show."}
{"text":"Service was good. Ordered pretzels and boneless wings. Pretzels had wayyy too much salt and wings weren't very good. Also ordered a perfect margarita and drink was too strong. It tasted like straight tequila. Two stars only because our waitress was quick and helpful."}
{"text":"Had dinner and margarita's here while in Vegas for business. The atmosphere on a Tuesday night was fun - I saw 4 different people dressed in pirate or sailor attire and wearing stilts hanging out in the restaurant. Not sure if that is normal for this place but it was fun to see! 

We started off dinner sharing nacho's and a crab cheese dip appetizer. Both were good, albeit greasy. I knew going into it I wasn't going to be eating healthy so I wasn't surprised. I had the perfect margarita to go along with the appetizers and it was okay. A little sweet for my tastes but drinkable. Then a coworker ordered the 100oz margarita that comes in what looks like a bong. It made us laugh and I thought the margarita out of that was decent - less sweet but  watered down! 

All and all I had fun at this place but it wasn't my kind of place."}
{"text":"Fun place, especially for happy hours.  They do make a good margaritta, the servings are very big, especially the nachos.  Hamburgers are good.

{"text":"Please don't go here. Went here with a huge wedding group and the service was slow, place was loud, and the food was not good at all. Dedication to theme was impressive but would not recommend"}
{"text":"We LOVED Margaritaville! The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the food was great! The cocktails were pretty good too . . . but the best thing has to be the location - we sat out on the balcony and it was perfect for a spot of people watching!!"}
{"text":"I love this place it's a staple of Las Vegas to me. They have strong margaritas and a very fun atmosphere in addition to casino. The food is decent however a bit pricey for what it is. Overall a very good experience!"}
{"text":"Drinks were really good. The food not worth the trip...(Crab & Corn Chowder, Seafood Mac & Cheese - Bad; Fish Taco's very average).  Atmosphere fun.  And, service was average."}
{"text":"The place was good and the food was tasty.
However,
The table and the chair and the floor under the table was dirty.
My medium done meat was grilled as a well done.
All these things are not big of an issue for me. But when it came to the wine, the second bottle if wine was served opened, which made me doubt. So I tasted it and made two of my friends taste my glass from the first bottle and compare it with the second bottle \"supposedly similar bottle\" and it was clearly not the same. And
The second bottle had a lighter taste than the first one.
I didn't complain about it as I had a friend who didn't want me to complain, so here I am writing my review.
I would never accept someone to fool me, but that waiter did."}
{"text":"Incredible experience!  First experience was for a convention and it was amazing.  Took the wife and kids to experience the ambiance and food and it was just as great!!  Our server Marcie was phenomenal!!   She made the experience an A+ outing.  Family loved it!!  This is a great place with great food and Marcie was beyond great!  Thanks for the memories Margaritaville, until the next time!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place in Las Vegas.  Is it because...the bartenders give me free drinks?  There's no cover?  You can park at O'shea's, grab a dollar draft and then hop across the street?  The outside bar on the upstairs balcony?  The drummer is cute and one of the coolest guys you'll ever meet?  Yes to all of the above.  Plus, and maybe most importantly, excellent captain and cokes served here.  If you're not in the mood to be a poser at one of the ultra groovy night clubs, this is a very chill spot on the strip.  Also, they have a ginormous nacho plate, if you're into that."}
{"text":"ONLY went here since we were crunched for time and had to find something close and quick. NEVER again. LOUD, too much hustle and bustle walking around. Not bad food, just your typical chain style fare.

Again, as I said,,,,never again."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Kevin is an awesome bartender too, he gave out a few free rounds and he's got some impressive skills."}
{"text":"Horrible. Just horrible. Hostess was on the phone and wouldn't give us the time of day. Waved a ticket in my face and told me turn around and stay to the right, not even looking at me. Just to find out that we were put all the way in the back of the restaurant next to the waitress station and kitchen door. We weren't even in the main floor and couldn't even enjoy the atmosphere of the place. I've been to another margaritaville elsewhere and it was well worth it but not here. Food was bland and not with the price. My \"applewood smoked bacon\" was a thin floppy piece of nothing that tasted like a dog treat. Fish and chips were bland with no flavor. Overall a horrible experience and would not go again."}
{"text":"We went in on a Saturday afternoon during the NCAA tournaments and spring break. The place was a mad house, there were people everywhere. The waiter gave us a table that apparently was still in use. I guess they went to the restroom, left their box to go on the table (but left a tip). When they came back and saw my friend and me sitting there they were pissed (as they should've been). Then, as we were seated, we watched groups of college kids walk out of the waiting line, up to a table with a waiter nearby and ask to sit... and the waiter cleaned the table for them! It was like a group of 6! I felt so bad for everyone else who'd been standing in line.

As for our service and food, it was great! I got the veggie burger that's made with peas, corn, carrots, broccoli, edamame and bell peppers. It was insanely good and one of the most unique burgers that I've ever had. The food was reasonably priced but I felt like their \"house margarita\" was a bit expensive when compared to their fancy margaritas, so I opted for a water instead. Both my friend and I were happy with our food."}
{"text":"First actual place on our drinking tour (post bachelorette party) of the Boulevard was Margaritaville.

We had originally wanted to sit at one of the bars, but apparently Sunday afternoons while football is on and it's beautiful outside makes for a hard time to get two spots. 

So we got classic margaritas from the small to-go bar, and wandered on our way. It was easy, fresh, quick, and the bartenders were super nice and non-Las Vegasy. 

We chatted in line with a big dude who was talking football and making our drinks extra special. Why hate on the tourist trap (because that's what the restaurant really is), when the tender pours an extra shot in each drink. Sign me up."}
{"text":"Very laid back (drunk) vibe...but hey, this is vegas after all.  Seems like it's always busy, with people hanging out all over the place.  They have a little patio that overlooks the strip...I'd recommend it for some great people watching. 
The downside:  we were seated at a boat.  Yes.  A. Boat.  But this boat did NOT have a good view of the ocean, and it was so dark, I could barely see my menu.  Try and sit at a non-boat if you can :)  You'll be closer to the stage and more \"in the action\"
The upside:  I had a great bowl of blue crab & corn chowder.  Seriously, this was one of the best soups I've ever had.  Rest of the food was just ok.  I was disappointed with my margarita.   You'd think ordering one here would be a no brainer, but it was small and tasted mass produced.  
Overall: Fun, loud place that you can come to with a group of your rowdy friends and not spend too much $.  Great location on the strip, you don't have to walk through a giant hotel."}
{"text":"Good place to go for a early dinner and get a jump on the night with some high quality drinks.  If you have been drinking Jim Beam and Jack Danials like they quit make'n the suff this would be a nice frozen break.  I about went to break the speakers cuz i love buffett but if you are their to long you will want to leave cuz of the music.  Avg food, Great drinks and nice deck area."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! My boyfriend and I are from Austin, Texas and we were so excited to visit Jimmy Buffets Margaitaville only to be greeted with horrible customer service. The hostesses told us we can seat ourselves outside which is understandable, but we sat there for 10 minutes without being greeted by a waiter and it wasn't even busy. I told the hostess we havent been waited on and told her where we were sitting and she looked confused and said okay. 20 minutes later we got up and told them we would go eat somewhere else and the hostesses that were his standing there said okay in a sarcastic way. I was so dissapointed because we even had our food picked out because we looked at the menu online and wanted to visit the gift shop to buy some Jimmy Buffet souveniers. We worked retail and understand the wait and how customer service works but this was absolutely a horrible experience! Sad to say that considering we are Jimmy Buffet fans."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went into Margaritaville in Las Vegas because we love all the other locations!  Vegas did not disappoint either.  I had the cheese burger in paradise (is there any other?) and my girlfriend had a taco salad.  Both were very tasty as were the perfect margaritas!  We also split the conch fritters to get a taste of key west.  We hung out and watched the band for a little bit and the people dancing.  Great times!

After dinner and a few more drinks, we went into the gift shop.  I was looking for a shirt I had seen in Key West a couple weeks before, but was disappointed when I found out they didn't have it.  A male employee approached and asked if I was finding everything ok, when I told him my story he said I could order it online.  We asked me to hold on and went off somewhere.  A few minutes later he returned with a printed out page of the shirt I wanted as well as the phone number for Key West.  I didn't get his name but I did ask if he was the manager, and he said he was the supervisor.  What great service!

After the gift shop we hit the casino and the bar.  I like when bartenders do tricks while serving the drinks!  What a great time I highly recommend Margaritaville!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE JIMMY BUFFET'S. Went crazy on those margaritas..mmmmm, yummy!"}
{"text":"First time here and in Vegas in general. We looked to yelp for reviews and found it really helpful.

A chap Marty explained to us on arrival that the tables were full, and to go over round the  bar to wait, where we could drink and wait to be seated. 
This left me somewhat confused as Marry never quite explained how we would be seated. Eg. Take a number. 
So we went round to the bar and could see the restaurant was half full from there.
Marty had misled us.
So back we came to have a word. Marty had left his post and was on a break (after working hard no doubt), and the new maitrede immediately gave us a seat. 
I asked where Marty was and the answer was he was on a break. 

Despite Marty, the food was good and we enjoyed our food. The beef burritos and coconut shrimp. Sadly the poor service darkened the experience.

My thanks to Marty that we will never be back."}
{"text":"I went because of the song lol. Tasty food, a little overpriced but that's to be expected based on its location. Friendly waitress. I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"Bad place to watch any game. They play load music while people were trying to watch the World Cup game on TVs that don't have speakers. We din't order anything and Ended up going down to Chayo Kitchen & Tequila Bar. There we watched both soccer games with a couple of buckets of Corona light (have to watch the calories so we can eat and drink more)."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat when your here on vacation or are in tourist mode."}
{"text":"I can see some of the reviews on here being negative. Here is my take on the recent visit and the place overall.
I am giving it 4 stars for atmosphere, drink selection and a staff member. 
Go in to this experience knowing that you are dealing with a national chain focused on tourists. If it is not for a large chain like this the others in the area will fold. 
We were first greeted by a hostess and a manager at the front entrance. It was literally 11 am on the money and they were opening. I asked the young female hostess for a table. She started to reply we are not open yet and could not seat us. Seeing we had two hungry, uncooperative kids, the manager Zack stepped in and said to seat us. The kids wanted to sit in the boat and again the hostess gave another negative answer. Zack again stepped in and said we are slow, let them sit there. Thank goodness because I had a bad feeling of where this was going.
The drink menu is completely island style and had a good selection. I will complain that I just saw my beer selection on draft, so I just asked for it. Our server never asked what sized draft I wanted and just selected the larger draft for me. I only discovered the option after looking at the menu further when ordering my food. I do appreciate the kid friendly atmosphere and the pre-meal toys to keep the kids busy. 
As others have said, you are paying a premium price for the tourist attraction theme but come cold Cleveland winters,I think I would return for the few hours of escapism. 
When our food arrived, it was plenty for the kids to spilt a kids meal and the taco salad was good. My burger was cooked to perfection and the toppings were fresh. I would like to see a few more onion rings for the upgrade price but the ones I had were very tasty. 
The restaurant had good island music playing and was noisy enough to drowned out the kids having fun! 
I would recommend a return but go on the theory of you are going to a chain targeted towards tourists in an up and coming area. If you can do that, I think you will enjoy. 
Thanks to Zack the manager for saving what could have been a rude, bad experience and making it a good time for our family. I wanted to thank him personally but lost track of him as he was making his rounds."}
{"text":"The bartender with a buzz short haircut was useless and rude.  After his fucked up customer service i found it surprising that he got mad cause he got 75cent tip... He crumpled the receipt up and threw it of the bar counter along with the change lol.  I usually tip my bartenders no less than $2 per drink but this guy was rude and uninviting right off the bat.  It seemed like he was checked out and ready to end his day.  Will never return to this place id rather give my money to the rundown Marilyn Monroe on drugs that was  outside...atleast she was smiling and greeting tourists SMH."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Drinks were ok, dinner not so much. Husbands burger was under cooked and waiter never came to ask how meal was. Many other better places to eat. Only go here for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I wish they have option to give zero star. Sucks and none of our dishes was fresh or tasty, nachos were saggy. Cold fries. If you are smart, stay away."}
{"text":"The food was all together okay, but the nachos were the most exciting thing we ordered. The staff was also very nice, but there could have been more people to help serve. I felt like there was only one girl serving all the tables."}
{"text":"The bartenders at the Tiki Bar are unsurpassed. Great spot to sit and rest for a while. You are on the Strip yet in a small cozy space where you can meet people and get away from the crowds."}
{"text":"Yep it is typical Vegas ie a bit touristy and a bit sleazy, however it is a great place to catch your breath and enjoy a cool drink. I haven't eaten here but the margarita's are quite good!"}
{"text":"One word. Nachos. The end. Oh, and get the blender margarita to accompany. I can't comment on any other of the food offerings since I have never had any of them, don't need to. This place is so much fun especially on the upstairs patio on a beautiful day with my Hubs."}
{"text":"Just went this weekend, always a great time and great food! Our waiter Sean made it even better! Such great service & very nice :-)"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Loved it!
Nachos were massive and so good, Hot wings were on point, and the banana daiquiri was pretty good."}
{"text":"We were there the previous weekend for a 21st Birthday party, drinks & burgers were good. Not a place to celebrate birthdays, Waitress didn't  acknowledge the birthday girl..hum!
 
This time, we thought we would try their  overpriced Fish Tacos, \"big disappointment \" thick tortillas, tasteless fish. I should have returned the 2 fish dinners we ordered but didn't want to ruin the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is a shithole. Smells like suntan lotion and broken dreams. Now for the food, How do you fuck up a burger? My advice to all.... Just keep walking, there are better things to eat out there. Don't waste your time or money on cesspool dump of a place. Oh one last thing, my watermelon \"margarita\" tasted like syrup and artificial lime. Just don't eat here."}
{"text":"The decor was nice, the hostess was pleasant and that was the only good thing. My husband and I went there 4 dinner but the server never came back to take the dinner order. He got our drinks asked if we like start w/ an appetizer so we did. The runner brought the food and we never saw the server again... $30 for 2 drinks and an appetizer total waste of money. I got the feeling the guy just didn't like the idea of having to serve ppl...don't waste your money"}
{"text":"ok, love the atmosphere. it's very cool with a beach theme, planes hanging from the ceiling, and jimmy buffet music playing all day. however, i feel the menu is overpriced for the amount of food you get. the food is good, but the price just kills it. i now believe margaritaville is on restaurant.com which would save a bunch of money. i've never had anything alcoholic here so i don't know about their happy hour. i may stop in for a drink here and there, but doubt i'd get another meal. i really liked the food but am not spending the kind of money they want."}
{"text":"First time at Margaritaville and I was very impressed with the service. To be honest I didn't expect much from the place at first, most casual bars have mediocre food and service, but I was definitely wrong. Our server Sean was great, he made outstanding recommendations on drinks as well as the food. He was just a courteous and genuine person, and I would return here on my next trip to Vegas based on his service alone. Totally recommend the Perfect Margarita and Nachos!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour 1/2 priced apps.  Love the Living It Up margaritas!  Good service.  Great patio.  Server was very friendly despite also being very busy.  Had quesadillas and wings.  All very good.  Carrot chips (vs. sticks) are a nice touch with the wings.  Wish we had a Margaritaville at home in Minnesota.  Guess we''ll just need to wait until the Jimmy show in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I would have never gone here had a local friend not suggested it. I would have guessed it would be loud, full of tourists in \"If You Cant Run With the Big Dogs Stay Off The Porch\" kinda attire, etc. I imagined overpriced fish sandwiches served at room temp. Servers wearing sunglasses.

I was right--the servers DID wear shades! But about everything else I was wrong. Food was good, service was great, not too crowded even for a Sat. afternoon. Yummy marg ... damn well better be, right? 

Sure, I will be humming Boat Drinks until the next lunar eclipse but there could be worse songs.

I will go back on my next trip out west."}
{"text":"Came for bike night and sat on the patio.  Worst service! We waited at least 10 minutes for our drinks. When more of the group came, an even longer wait for just drinks. It wasn't even that busy, so I don't even know what the problem was. Food was ok, we only ordered appetizers because we did not want to wait even longer for real food."}
{"text":"The Volcano nachos are fantastic. Service is excellent. Music is fine."}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for this place. Sat us down twice at  wobbly tables. Third times a charm I guess. We sat for a bit before a server acknowledged us. Took about a half an hour to get our food :/. Food was really good but the service was really slow. I saw some poor guy have drinks spilled on him and never once saw a manager go over. At least the food was good."}
{"text":"Nachos bleh...  They call them Valcano Nacho's 

the top of the Nacho's are topped with steak, sour c and quac.  As you get lower you find, burnt chips, 7/11 nacho cheese and 7/11 nacho beef BLAH!!!!  

I will never spend 14$ on nacho's again EVER~!! 

In our Nacho's we also found a tomato slice with the label still on it, now I asked the server if the veggies are cleaned before put into my food then why is this thing all cut up and still on each side of the tomato??  She added we are just too busy to peal them off.  

The Manager came out and I guess she had told him what she told us, he wasn't happy and took it off the bill, said we could keep the nachos but I asked him to remove it. 

Drinks were over priced and not strong at all....  Good thing I really didn't want a buzz anyways. 

Won't go to again. 

D"}
{"text":"Great place, lots of fun. Bartenders are great and every now and then they have margarita specials (on 2/22/16 they were only $3 a piece! The casino is very relaxed and comfortable too. It is right across the street from Caesars Palace and next to a new area of restuarants, which are very cool."}
{"text":"We usually find our way to Margaritaville on every visit to Las Vegas.  It is a fun drinking and dining establishment.

Fun - the place is always crowded and loud, in a good way.  There is almost always a live band in the evening.  Folks get on the dance floor.  Large groups for birthdays or bachelorette parties keep the place lively.  I have seen staffers on stilts and making balloon sculptures for guests.  It is almost like stepping into Mardi Gras.  This is not a place for quiet conversation with your table-mates.  But, you probably already spent too much time talking to them already!

Drinking - the bar has an impressive list of tequila selections.  The house margarita is very good (and very strong).  Buffett fans will find references to songs and stories in the names of the drinks.  The wait staff is attentive and you never need to wait long for a refill.  Drinks are served in plastic to-go cups for your walk back to your hotel.

Dining - Like many other reviewers, we normally have the Volcano Nachos.  The serving is huge, probably enough for 3-4 people.  There are other items on the menu, but the nachos are so good, we have never had a reason to try anything else.  Plus, the food prices are very reasonable for the Strip.

We showed up around 10:00 pm on a Sunday and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  This is not abnormal at this time of night.  However, this was not a problem as there is a gift shop to browse and the Margaritaville casino (part of the Flamingo) is close by if you have a longer wait. 

Overall, Margaritaville is a great place for fun, late-night dining in Las Vegas.  We will certainly be back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Meh....as expected for a chain restaurant in Vegas.  Everything was average....food emphasized quantity over quality, cocktails were ok, and service was average.  I found the crowd annoying....it's kind of a place where people stumble in off the street so you get a lot of that vibe in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is big, busy and dark.  

We (4 of us) dropped in b/c we were staying at the Flamingo, hungry and ready for some lunch.  We ordered the nachos and only conquered the 1st layer.  Huge!  They don't come with salsa but the waitress said I could pay 3.00 for a side.  WTF!  No salsa with nachos?  

We all ordered margaritas and for $9.95 we were expecting something big, Vegas style and all we got was a small glass.  Rip off, I mean I know Vegas is expensive, but come on!   They were tasty, but still a rip off for the size.  

It didn't give me any reason for me to go back and there are too many other options in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. I had the volcano nachos one time and they were huge, there was enough for a couple of people. They were tasty. Another time had the burger and fries. The burger and fries were good enough but not the best I've had.  The prices are above average but that is to be expected for the Strip unfortunately. All in all, the food and service was decent, not great but good enough so will likely be stopping in again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Salads were great.  Pretzel sticks were HUGE & delicious.  Nachos were nasty & soggy.  Idk, it just seems like they should be able to pull off a good plate of nachos for $18."}
{"text":"Just my first time back to this restaurant in two years. I was shocked at the difference in service and food. The fish was burnt to a crisp the chicken was super dry. Even the service at slacked off terribly. Looks like I need to find a restaurant"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic jambalaya. One of the better that I have had. Very good atmosphere, probably the norm at a Margaritaville. Great music. Very good specialty drinks. I had the \"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere\" as recommended by our waiter after he asked a few questions of what type of drinks we like. He was fantastic and even steered us away from what we were concerned that we wouldn't like. Loved the honesty! Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Just finishing up dinner her now with my new wife :-) Ryan A. was our server and Will was the manager. We had ordered a burger and steak which unfortunately taken around 30+ mins to arrive. Ryan was very apologetic and kept checking on the food but did the best he could. He got Will involved and our food was out in less than 5 mins - Will personally brought our food to the table as well. Both felt very bad about having us wait and were very professional in handling it the  situation. Both Will and Ryan A. great took care of us and ensured we were fine and well taken care of prior to leaving. Would definitely return knowing the wait staff care for their customers and management takes accountability for the service. Of course the food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Holy Middle America, Batman!  A Jimmy Buffett theme restaurant in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip?  I set my expectations as low as I possibly could, people, I really did, but I'm still left with nightmares of a culinary hell where the only dining choices are this place or Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo Cantina.  I doubt Jimmy B's involvement in this travesty goes much beyond lending his name and cashing a few checks, but that's not gonna stop me from flipping that parrothead the bird next time I see him."}
{"text":"If you are going to charge $8 for a slice of key lime pie AND use Jummy Buffett's name to sell it please don't serve a piece of nasty freezer pie smeared across a semi clean plate! Just awful!

Also worst service I've had anywhere. The waiter didn't feel like I'd tipped him enough I guess because he brought my check back after I paid,  slapped it in front of me, and said \"There's a tipping guide at the bottom!\". What? !?

Will never never eat here again. And as a Jimmy Buffett fan it saddens me that is name is in this place."}
{"text":"Wife and I had one of the worst meals ever. Blackened mahi mahi tacos were so salty I thought someone was playing a joke. And the Chesseburger was nothing great either. Dennys serves a better one and for half the price. The perfect margurita was ok but i definately would of expected a \"wow\" from the home of the margurita. It was not even close. Sorry I wish I could recommend it but just can't. Overpriced ( I know its Vegas) but if the food was good I wouldn't of minded the tourist prices.  BTW - Very loud too.  Maybe I'm just getting old."}
{"text":"Went a month back for my 21st birthday and had the time of my life! This place is absolutely the best on the Strip. Had a live band play all the great country songs and I had some of the best nachos I've ever had. This place is amazing and will definitely be seeing me again."}
{"text":"Had great service at both the restaurant and store at Margaritaville last week. Glenn was great, provided such a personal level of service.  We are visiting Las Vegas in a near future and our first stop most definitely be at your store.
Your professionalism was very well appreciated.
Sincerely, Oscar Dawson and family."}
{"text":"\"No Shoes ? No Shirt ? No Problem !\" Telle est la devise à Margaritaville !

La ville de la margarita ? Quasiment et si c'était vraiment une ville, on serait prêt à y habiter pour boire tous les soirs une bonne margarita et se goinfrer d'un volcan de nachos !!!
Oui se goinfrer, vraiment il n'y a pas d'autre mot, car voir arriver cette montagne de nachos fait presque peur, mais en se mettant à trois dessus et en ne mangeant que ça, on a finalement réussi à en venir à bout ! 
(bon j'était un peu tout seul dessus à la fin mais je partage la victoire !)

En moyenne les cocktails sont dans les 10$ et les margaritas les valent largement, elles sont bien dosées et il y a des propositions assez intéressantes !
Le nachos volcano quand à lui est à 15$, donc pour 3 personnes c'est tout à fait acceptable, vous repartez repus et fiers d'avoir terminé ce plat que certains mangent seul(e)s... question entrainement peut être...

Seul petit bémol : c'est très bruyant et assez sombre dans la partie bar, on est bien mieux dans la partie restaurant sur la terrasse avec vue sur le Strip, mais là par contre, allez savoir pourquoi... les verres sont en plastique !

Attendez vous à attendre un peu selon l'heure pour avoir une table, mais ça vaut le coup de tenter l'expérience !"}
{"text":"Their outdoor patio is not facing the water.  Their margaritas tasted they were from a mix and their food was below average.  I had the chicken ceasar salad and the lettuce was wilted and the chicken had no flavor.  In addition, they are quick expensive."}
{"text":"We went in to find a table and the guy with the light blue shirt on in the bar section was extremely rude. Walked right by us, acted like he didn't hear us and then all the people at the bar saw how he brushed us off and walked away. Let everyone know this. Go home and take a vacation day. Poor service. I'll go back and take a pic of the guy with the light. Light shirt and beard."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! Margaritas - BLAH! No alcohol in them. Chips/Salsa - BLAH! We complained to the waitress and she just blew us off. We didn't even order a meal...we just left. I will never go there again. What a waste of money!"}
{"text":"I love margaritaville! Everytime I come to Vegas I always need to make a stop here. I have never actually sat down and had a meal here, but the bar at the entrance is amazing! Today our experience was more exceptional than usual. We had a bartender named Jon, if you ever come, find him at the bar, he's super friendly, knows all the Vegas hot spots and makes for a super fun experience! I highly recommend this place to anyone. They have great skinny margaritas and an awesome drink called the habana banana (I think thats what it was called!)"}
{"text":"it took the waitress 10mins to come take our drink orders another 10 mins to get them. Once she put the drinks down she left so we had to wait til she came back for our orders. I had the caribbean jerk chicken...not impressed! Way too much sauce and too salty. The carrots and celery it came with were better."}
{"text":"Good food and good entertainment.  Food is good and plentiful.  Where the Key West Margaritaville lacks in flare this place has it."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here on our first night in Vegas (03/14/14). There was a wait but only because the top, outside area was reserved for a private party, if not I'm sure we would of been seated right away. Place was packed but we waited longer to be seated than to get our food. Fast and good service. Drinks and burgers were delicious!! Ate here again right before kitchen closing time the next day (closes at 1 a.m.) and menu options are limited at that time but still great food. They had an awesome band playing, people dancing and just a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a place!  Try the margaritas which are marked only for serious fans.  BOOZY.  Took me two hours to finish in which time my date finished four pints haha!  I went onto the frozen premixed ones after that.  Danielle our server was really cool.  We had a great time!  Not too impressed with the Asian salad we had, but hey you don't come here for the food."}
{"text":"This is the first time I ever went to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.  What can I say?  How about I spell it? T-A-C-K-Y!!!!!  The place just oozed with ... I don't know how to put it.  Remember when you first saw the Alien in Alien and it was all slimy.  That's how I felt walking in.  I felt dirty and weird.  The food however was tasty.  I enjoyed the Jambalaya.  The bathrooms were clean.  My feet never stuck to the bathroom floor which is a plus in my book.  I'll have to see if they have take out because I can't go back."}
{"text":"5 cent happy hour was awesome. And they have by far the best public bathrooms on the strip"}
{"text":"Great spot for margaritas and a nacho volcano. I love the boats inside and all the TVs"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! Excellent service from our waitress Cyndra! She was very friendly and helpful when ordering. I ordered the fish n chips! The best fish n chip I ever had! They have jalapeño tarter sauce that is delicious! If you like fish n chips, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"In common with most Vegas bars, Margaritaville promotes itself as a place to drink, eat, party and hang out and have some fun. What many people don't know, is that it serves a pretty good breakfast, too.


 The location is front-of-Strip on 3 floors. If you take the elevator to the 3rd floor, you can sit out on a terrace and enjoy views of the Strip, and across to Caesar's Palace and The Forum. There's not a slot machine in sight, and you will be attended by solicitous staff who are keen to ensure you are going to have a nice day.


 It serves staples such as Eggs Benedict, Bacon & Hash Browns, and even offers the 'Boatmeal' - a healthy option (rare in the USA) of oats with fresh raspberries and strawberries. Wash it all down with a bottomless cup of coffee. Reckon on $10 p.h.


 And the Margarita bit? They specialise in giant Margaritas of all types, with 100's of different tequilas on offer. But it was a bit soon after breakfast, when one has work to do"}
{"text":"My friend and I here for our second visit August 2015. Came specifically for margaritas and the volcano nachos. We weren't disappointed. Great service at the bar, friendly and attentive staff, great and reasonably priced drinks and the nachos as always were delicious! Will keep this as my go to place to cool off when walking around the strip in the  burning midday heat. Thanks again margaritaville :-)"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and food is great! But the bartenders are slow and not eager to serve, the wait is long (2 hours) for a table when there are plenty of tables open, and slow on delivering food (only appetizers were ordered)."}
{"text":"Food was Yummy!!!! Best burger I've us in a long time!!! It was busy but even for being busy we never got refills I had to get up and ask for one at the bar. It took 35 mins to get our check which we asked for as we got our food (we had an appointment to be at). So 4 stars for food and atmosphere.... If we had a better server it would be 5 stars"}
{"text":"I stopped by JB's after a night of parties/gambling and just needed some food.  JB's was open and available so we stopped in.  The restaurant seemed to follow a ship's decor, with mock ships and galleys for seating.  We sat down and took a look at the menu.  It seemed like a glorified TGI Friday's.  We ordered simple things, like lava shrimp and burgers, as well as margaritas, which they were supposed to be famous for.  The margaritas were so-so and the food nothing special.  Like I said, a glorified TGI Friday's.

On the plus side, they did have a band on stage with nice live music so it wasn't a total loss.  I mean, we were stuffed by the end of the meal, but for some odd reason expected more for the price.  Oh well, afterall, it's Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place to start the night out!! Stopped in somewhat early to get the drinking festivities started and since it was a group of girls we decided to start with margaritas. The drinks are tasty and made with lots of fruity flavors, however, they could be somewhat stronger. We all had about 3 margaritas each but barely were feeling the buzz as we left.  I've also had the nachos, which are MASSIVE and can feed up to 4 people, easily.  The nachos are not the best or the worst but they will do the trick.  There's an hourly show that involves ship crew costumed entertainers on stilts and a mermaid that dives into a water tank - it's entertaining the first hour but if you're there for more than an hour you might get tired of seeing the same thing over and over.  We sat up in the bar area near the water tank and ended up getting splashed a few times from the water but we weren't bothered by it like some other people there were.  Of course, this was also 2 margaritas in so we were already focused on our mission and smiling from ear to ear.  The \"captain\" made me a balloon crown since it was my birthday which was super sweet of him and he even had a few dirty jokes that made us laugh...not sure if it was because they were actually funny or if it was just because it was awkward...but nonetheless we made memories, haha. The staff is very friendly and our waiter was a quirky guy who made us laugh the entire visit. I can't vouch for the rest of the menu so no idea on the food but the drinks are decent if you want to start your night off here to get a steady pace going.  The music is decent, not too many top 100 current hits playing but I was told there's sometimes a DJ in the later hours. Def a good time at least for one drink while in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Margaritaville in several different cities, but I have to say that after 2 attempts in 3 years I will not be giving them a 3rd chance. The service is terrible and on  both occasions we just got up and left without even eating."}
{"text":"place is always happening and the food is great.  it can get real crowded and the wait can be long to get a seat. so i f there is room in the bar then go ahead if not. wait. its worth it"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a business trip, and I'm not a gambler or party animal. I was just looking for some decent food and a beer. Service was quick and cordial, and the Mahi Mahi was perfect. Sit at the bar and get prompt and curious service."}
{"text":"C'est toujours un plaisir de retrouver les restaurants de Jimmy buffet´s! Superbe ambiance, décors digne d'un film... Le seul hic est le prix. Mais on ressort toujours avec un large sourire aux lèvres"}
{"text":"I like how the restaurant looks like, among other things they have a wide margarita menu. My choice pear margarita wasn\"t that brilliant...it was ok, next one will be a perfect margarita and let's hope it s what I m looking for!"}
{"text":"I'm a big Jimmy Buffett fan so I was so excited to go to Margaritaville none where I live....It was awesome omg had such a great time loved the decor of course the Jimmy Buffett music..my food was soooo good got the coconut shrimp and mashed potatoes the had bacon i them soooo good and Margaritas were very good. Hubby also enjoyed the decor and music and the little show they put on good service but disliked his food he ordered jerk chicken and the string beans were cold. 

Had a coupon to get to the front of the line so not wait :: and a coupon for a free souvenir in gift shop. Bought lots of stuff in store :0"}
{"text":"To me if you're looking to go to a restaurant to eat at on the strip, then this would be the one. I went here over the weekend and I was with my friends, so we decided to make a trip. The wait didn't take long and I ordered the \"El Diablo\" burger and had a frozen concoction and both were good. Believe me the atmosphere was nice and the service was great from our server Maryn. Jimmy Buffett you have made your restaurants very good and I will be back here next time when I'm in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"We brought a group of about 25 for drinks and food and they pretty much hooked us up with our own area on the 3rd floor deck.  Drinks were good and if you want pub food like nachos, burgers and fish tacos for a good price then there's really no better place to go.  With all the inflated prices on the heart of the strip, Margaritville still gives you a pretty good bang for your buck.

You waitress Shaavon was phenomenal....she kept all the bills separate for those who needed to leave early and continued to bring everyone their food and drinks over the span of three hours without missing a beat.  It sent a private party but it mine as well have been...thanks Shaavon and MargRitaville for giving us e VIP treatment while we were there.  See you during our next visit!"}
{"text":"I go to Vegas all the time, and this place never lets me down!! Great burgers and other dishes, perfect margaritas and other frozen concoctions! I crave this place and seriously wish I could eat here everyday. The atmosphere is awesome too complete with live music and 2 floors of island greatness! wasted away again..."}
{"text":"Went to the new Margaritaville with four other people today. It was early, before noon. We were told the wait was 40 minutes to eat outside on the patio which was understandable. We asked if we could eat at the rooftop bar instead and they told us no that only appetizers could be served up there. What kind of rule is that? I've never been to a restaurant bar you couldn't eat at. So we sat inside. First I ordered a 5 O'clock somewhere drink. It was suppose to be a pink color, taste fruity, and garnished with a pineapple and a cherry. The sever brought a green drink with a lime and said, \"Don't worry this is the right drink they used a different color grenadine.\" And walked away. Took one sip and it was a margarita. Why come up with such an elaborate lie? I didn't even ask for a new drink because she didn't come back to the table for a long time and I didn't feel like calling her out on that nonsense. Then we all waited over an hour for our food. Most of the tables food was cold. The fish tacos I had were so bland and it was said to come with habanero cream sauce and it did not have that on the tacos. I got them because I wanted something spicy. Complete let down. The side of rice and beans had no flavor either. We also had to ask for water refills which should just be a given. When water is low fill it up, come on serving 101. After we ate we went to the rooftop bar because we wanted to go outside in the first place and we were told we couldn't sit down at a table because it was reserved. We all crammed in a corner were there were not enough seats for all of us. We were up there for another hour and no one was even seated at that table the entire time! The atmosphere was nice but considering how poor the service was, the bland cold food, and the outrageous prices I won't be back. I don't mind dropping money on good food but this was not even close. Too bad I didn't listen to all the other yelp reviews. Next time I want to spend time in the flats it won't be here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place on the strip!  Why wouldn't it be, with the best margaritas and food in a great location.  I was just here last week and had my regular Uptown Margarita and the nachos which are amazing.  Actually I had three uptowns before I left late in the afternoon.  No problem, I was walking so the roads were safe.  
My favorite spot is one of the up stair outdoor balconies which were not open this time but they have their own bars and you can look right over the strip and people watch.  You are right in the middle of the action in this place.  The menu is wide with many Caribbean items and the prices are actually better then most places on the strip.  I usually hit this place several times on my stay in town and I am never disappointed with the friendly service and great food and drinks.  
I also always stop by the gift store next door and see what new cool things they have for myself and gifts.  Always thinking about Christmas.  :)
For the best margaritas in town, this is as good as it gets!!!"}
{"text":"We came to Margaritaville to get a drink on Friday afternoon. Even during a day, this place was crowded and very popular.  Margarita that I ordered -Strawberry & Mango- was not cheap but tasty. You can see the great atmosphere from outside."}
{"text":"OK don't go there for the food but make sure you get there for happy hour! best deal in town at 5\"o clock 5 cent drafts but it does get real crowed and loud bar tenders where great it is a good time. and don't be cheap give them at least 5 dollar tip and you are still way ahead."}
{"text":"Had a slightly better burger here than I did at some of the hotel restaurants at a couple places just off the strip, so that's good I suppose.  Pretty run of the mill food otherwise.  Will give them credit for sheer size and ridiculousness of an item such as the Volcano burger.

As others have pointed out its not all about the food here.  Atmosphere is king and boy does it have it.  What is \"it\"?  I'm not sure really...but it is entertaining to say the least.

I did lulz at the never ending stream of Jimmy Buffet videos on the televisions."}
{"text":"Understandably the place was quite busy during a Saturday night, however don't try and order food if your seated in the bar area. Basically ignored the entire hour we waited for someone who could take our order, and we had to move dirty plates and cup out of our way just to sit!! Gross"}
{"text":"Look, this place isn't a 5 star restaurant, but I'm giving it 5 anyway because I friggin' love it.  I've gone here dozens of times with my wife, friends, and/or family, and I can't get enough of it.  The atmosphere is usually very fun, everyone is having a good time, and things are just....laid back.  I get the Volcano Nachos each and every time, so I can't speak much on the other menu items.  For $15.99 you get a plate of nachos that 2 people can very rarely finish, so it's basically a nacho buffet for under $10/person.  Can't beat that.  And they're really GOOD nachos, not your generic nachos.  

Drinks can be a little pricey, but it's on the Las Vegas Strip, so that's to be expected.  You can plan on paying around $10 for any of their mixed drinks, and I think their beers will run you anywhere from $5-$8 (I don't drink beer, but that's just been what I can remember from people with us ordering them).  The main level can get a little noisy at times, but they have a 2nd and 3rd level where things are a lot quieter if you want to be able to carry on a casual conversation.  But if you're going there for a good time and you're not going to be there many times, I'd definitely recommend the ground level so you can get the full experience.

Waiters and waitresses are generally on the ball and keep your glasses full and address any needs, although there has been a time or 2 where that wasn't the case.  That's to be expected after literally probably 50 visits, though.  

Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"stopped in here late night to get a drink with a friend while our friends were gambling in the flamingo.  the bartender was really nice and answered our questions about their drinks really well.  I would say stay away from their 60 ounce margarita as it is like $60 or something crazy like that.  we just got regular size ones, but the bartender made like 2/3 of the cup tequila which was awesome, and that drink did the job for getting us really hammered ontop of everything else we had to drink before that"}
{"text":"They have GREAT margaritas and their coconut shrimp is amazing....love that sauce. It's a nice lunch spot. I sat near the windows and had a great view - is it worth the price? I don't think so but it's an okay sit down spot and it's in a great area."}
{"text":"We had a great experience coming here today. We were super excited to hear the catch of the day was grouper (our favorite) and it was delicious. Our sever Julia has an amazing personality. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here."}
{"text":"After getting married at The Flamingo my wife and I had our reception dinner here and that is what this review is going to focus on. Our experience here was great and we couldn't have been happier. I thought it might be difficult setting up a dinner party from across the country but it was simple.

We had set up our reception months in advance and had about two dozen guests. We were given a special menu with 5 choices including cheeseburgers, chicken, and shrimp. A small professional wedding cake for dessert was also provided. We also were given one type of appetizers for everyone and two hours of Margaritas and Beer. So that was our menu. On to the review.

When we first arrived we were taken to our tables that were reading and waiting for us. They had made up some personalized menus and set them at each place setting which was a cool little touch. Within seconds a tray of Margaritas and a bucket of Landshark beer arrived at each table. I wasn't sure what to expect when it came to the margaritas before hand. I kinda thought they would be small and weak since we were on a drink plan but they were neither of those things. In fact they were pretty awesome. I don't usually drink margaritas but I drank plenty of those and I have photographic evidence that they were quite strong!

The appetizers we had was Lava Lava Shrimp and oh man were they good. Everyone, even a couple people who usually don't eat shrimp, loved them. I still bring them up to my wife as a reason to go back to Vegas!

The entrees were very good too and we were given enough options that everyone found something they wanted. I heard no complaints from anyone and It was definitely better than an average buffet wedding or the simple choice of chicken or fish.

They provide a simple cake with the package but also offer several options as upgrades that you can choose get. Not really caring about fancy looking cakes we went with the basic option and it was quite good and looked very nice as well. I know some people are really into wedding cakes so it was nice to have options in that regard.

The service was better than good. Nobody ever was without a drink. In fact they brought them too fast if that's even possible! My next drink was always in front of me before being finished with my current one.  At the end they were still bring them out as fast as ever and since of course its Vegas, people were taking bottles of Landshark out to the street when they were leaving.

The price was less than several other options we had looked at in Vegas and the setting was very fun and party-like which was why we chose it. Everyone had a great time. If you are looking for a place to hold a reception or some kind of group party I would recommend this place to anyone. Its such a fun place."}
{"text":"Dropped by a couple of times while headed to the football game.  Both times we were met be very friendly staff and seated right away.  Having been to several other Margaritavilles we knew what to expect.

The place is loud, loud loud.  We ordered the the volcano of chips.  It was great, the drinks are a bit small but good.  Both times we only ordered appetizers and found them plentiful."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch around 3pm. Not very crowded, but yet our service was very slow. I would be worried about how long it would take to get your food during peak meal times. The food was good. We got the chicken sandwich and fish sandwich. Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Best place in Vegas to have nachos and a drink!!! Great atmosphere and wonderful bartenders! Vlad and Drego are the best!!! Can't wait to get back!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the menu. been to a few others around the country, but this one seemed to have a lesser menu. Staff is nice, clean place. nice atmosphere. Way too loud. They play music at \"club\" levels & you can't hear anyone speaking around you."}
{"text":"Half way decent food for an alright price considering it has ourdoor dining mid-strip. Their nachos could feed a small army.
Service was half ass and took a while to receive our food. It was like they were short a couple servers. The margaritas looked like they were served in dixie cups.
I didn't like that I was charged for their crappy souvenir glass ($8) when I ordered my draft beer. The server didn't take it off the bill when I mentioned it to him I didn't want it and there for he ended up paying for it out of his tip.
I'll probably never come back, but I doubt it will still be around by the time I'm back in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Friends came into town and after a day of casino wanderin we were in need of some grub before a late night dinner reservation. We wanted nachos. Man oh man did we find a great place for them in Margaritaville. Getting there the place looked packed but we somehow managed to wrangle a table and not long after sitting down someone came along to take our order. A group of 5 we ordered margaritas and the guy offered us a \"tower\" which is like 12 margaritas in one giant tower for the same price as 5 single margaritas - so we did it. Got the plate o nachos as well. Everything came out within 10 minutes. 
Everything tastes like the regular pre-packed mixes and cans. The margaritas we nothing to rave about and the nachos were pretty standard fare with no real heart to the salsa or cheese, but once we got into our 2nd and 3rd glasses of margaritas it was party time and everything started tasting GREAT! 
Now came the best part of all. We were sitting close to the top bar and right next to a giant glass of swirling green liquid with a ladder next to it. You want this table. Our waiter suggested we should move the table back and enjoy the show. The jimmy buffet song begins to play, a very sexy scantly clad girl comes out holding margarita pitchers, ascends the ladder climbs to the top of a mountain and disappears, only to emerge in a bikini and go down a slide into the glass where she performs a show that can only be described as legendary. She even takes pictures with you. 
And all in all we really didn't spend that much. Between the tower and the nachos we were only at like $60 for 5 people and we were pretty well satisfied. Add a show onto that and I sure walked out of there happy. One of the best values on the strip I have come across."}
{"text":"Great potential- good location, large space and a good looking menu. The night we went for dinner, there were few people in the restaurant (that should have been a harbinger). We still had to wait a while to be seated. The waiter saw us quickly and took our order. It was a long wait for the food, and it was cold when it arrived. The waiter disappeared after taking the order, and we didn't see him again until after our cold food was delivered. Too bad because the menu looks good."}
{"text":"I'm only giving a one star 'cause it's mandatory. Went on a Monday at 1130am. Waited 5 minuets (not bad right) go inside it's 30% full. We tell our hostess the table is unstable (like literally kept rocking back and forth by itself). She looks at us like we are rude and says let me get someone to fix it. Again 30% full plenty of tables to sit us at. Then she comes back and says ok let me sit you at another table. At the new table we wait 6-8 minuets while waiters keep passing us by, people seated after us receive drinks before us. And the waiters just look right at us and pass by. There's so many other restaurants with great service and excellent meal choices nearby... CHOOSE THEM. Ended up going to ON THE STRIP! Excellent service, awesome food, highly recommend them."}
{"text":"My favorite \"independent\" resturant on the strip! The views are awesome for people watching, the drinks are nice and cool on a hot day and the food is American chic with a tons of options for their take on Mexican and Spanish foods... which they pull off well. Better be hungry cuz their burgers are large and oh so juicy! Did I mention they have an aweome drink menu?"}
{"text":"We came here for a drink and snack. It was pricey for small drinks and the nachos we ordered were huge but not very good. Atmosphere was kind of cool., they have a volcano that erupts inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered boneless wings, but their boneless wings are actually boneless chicken tenders/strips unless they messed up on the order. They wouldn't allow me to order more than one alcoholic drink at a time, so I couldn't buy a round of shots for my friends. I ordered the mushroom burger and got a bacon and cheese burger; however, they didn't charge me for the burger, but then again it wasn't what I wanted. Food was ok. Overall service good, but their policies and food deliver was less than appealing."}
{"text":"Food and service is always high.  Place is almost always hopping from breakfast til closing.
I would swear, however, that the quality of their margaritas have gone downhill in the last few years.  I know their method is pretty simple but their best was too sweet and not great.  Maybe I just had a bad bartender or 3 while I was there but it was nothing special."}
{"text":"If you want a place where there's always a party going on, where they serve good food and great drinks, this is the spot! Every time we go to Vegas Margaritaville makes the cut as a \"go to\" place for at least one meal, without exception.  Yes, the wait can be lengthy but it never feels like it is as long as they say it is going to be, as there's plenty to do while waiting for the table to be ready. Shopping in the Margaritaville store, or even going those few extra steps into the casino at the Flamingo passes the time quite nicely. We have never had bad service at Margaritaville Cafe, quite the opposite in fact. If you're in a hurry they'll get you in and out, if you want to take a little more time they don't rush you through your meal.

About the music: If you are not a Parrothead you're not likely to get a whole lot out of the music. Most people who are unfamiliar with Jimmy's style don't get it, therefore they automatically say they don't like the music in the cafe. It is NOT country. Let me repeat that, Jimmy Buffett's music is NOT country. He has a style all his own, largely influenced by his love of all things Caribbean. His music has a rock/reggae/popish vibe Yes, he has collaborated on some songs with some of Nashville's biggest stars, but that is not his niche.

Lots of folks have indicated that this is not a good place for kids, I agree from the standpoint of why take a kid to Vegas (as a rule, I don't usually take my kids when I go). If I found myself down there with kids, however, I really think they would dig the Margaritaville Cafe. With everything going on in there as far as the volcano, the guys on stilts, the balloon animals, what kid wouldn't like that?

Heading down to Vegas in a few weeks, I'm thinking that the Margaritaville Cafe may end up being the first stop."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat . Great staff great music and atmosphere. Best gravy we ever had. It was busy when we went and we had to wait a little bit for our food the manager came out and apologized and our order arrived shortly there after. They took a complimentary photo for us and we picked it up after our meal. Definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"**Update** It's now been THREE WEEKS since I emailed the management team, per THEIR request, to speak about my experience, and have yet to hear back from them. Unacceptable, but at this point I'm not even surprised. 




This place took a dive over the past few years. 

Rolled in at noon hungover on a Saturday for a quick lunch, ordered the acclaimed $18 'volcano nachos'. It was a plate of Tostitos with a couple jalapeños on it. Okay, not like it used to be, whatever good hang out spot, I'll live. I asked for a side of salsa, assuming our server forgot it. She said that I have to pay $4 for a side of salsa. Are you kidding me?? Dry chips with minimal toppings and NOTHING to dip it in included. So I asked her if it came with anything, she said no sides included, basically shut the conversation down. 

Still baffled by what I heard, I grabbed a busser passing by, asked him for a side of salsa. He said no problem. Our server ended up bringing a tiny side of salsa. Cool at least I got that. I sarcastically asked her if I was getting charged for it, she said yes no sides are free. $2 for a individual dipping size salsa, $4 for a small bowl. I told her to take it back, then she proceeded to argue with me, telling me I already ordered it. Wow. Asked for a manager, explained the situation and terrible service, he did not even budge, still wanted me to pay for the salsa. I sent the food back and left. 

They know they will still get the business, but not mine ever again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, a little pricey but to be fair most restaurants in Vegas are overpriced and the portions are more than fair. We look forward to going there again."}
{"text":"The nachos are the best, burgers are tasty and the drinks are cold.  It was a blistering hot day so all 6 of us in our party ordered waters to go along with the adult beverages.  The water was awful, tasted like they got it from the pool.  I know this is not the place to go for water but it would've been nice to get a little hydration in before venturing out into 115 degrees.  The waitress couldn't get my order straight for the life of her.  I was the first to order; a draft bud light, a glass of water and a black and bleu burger.  She brought everyone their water, except me. Brought me bottled beer after I asked for draft. The food was served, I didn't get anything.  The food runner had to take my order prior to leaving the table.  No apologies from the waitress for anything just that it would be a few more minutes. I'd come back for the food but not the service."}
{"text":"We went to Margaritaville last night with some friends who had come to town and wanted to try it.  The overpriced food was mediocre. We started with the tortilla soup, which was pretty much chicken chili. More like a thick sauce and not very soupy. Again, mediocre.  I had the Caribbean chicken salad. The cucumbers were cut into tiny pieces with the skin left on which was bitter and tough to chew. The chicken seemed to have been defrosted, which gave it a very weird texture.  My fiance had the chicken pasta, which was the highlight of our meal, but definitely not enough food for my hungry boy. We spent about $75 included a martini and a beer, but I can definitely find better food elsewhere for a much better price.

The worst part was the round of waters brought with the meal that no one ordered, which explained why we were never brought soda or beer refills after that, since we didn't see the waiter again until he started to usher us out with our check.  Our table of 7 was right in the middle of where the dance floor usually is. And the management stood near the bus station staring us down and tapping their toes till we vacated the table. Once one of us stood up, the bus boys were there clearing the table before we could even breathe.

We felt very unwelcome and will never go back."}
{"text":"Went to Margaritaville on New Years Eve and had the friendliest most Amazing waitress named Rene! We loved her! So attentive,  happy and helpful. Food and Margarita's great too! We come here several times a year from Spokane Washington and look forward to the next time!  The manager was awesome too! He took the time too answer our questions and had a nice chat with him about the New Year's Eve festivities.  So sorry I can't remember his name But Thank You!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but prices are high, this is right on the strip though so to be expected. Very good steak quesadilla. Good location, had a chance to watch a talented hula hoop street performer while eating dinner."}
{"text":"Loved the nachos and chicken Cobb salad.  5 o'clock somewhere was also sting and yummy"}
{"text":"You would think that Margaritaville would have a decent fish sandwich. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE FISH FOR A SANDWICH. Waiter said they'd been without fish for a week. Then when we wanted a cup of coffee to go, the waiter couldn't find a to-go cup and refused to give me coffee in a plastic cup. Burgers were ok, but quality of meat was not the best. Music was great! Atmosphere good."}
{"text":"Margaritaville is what it is, a place to have fun and have some drinks. If you take it for more than that, you'll be disappointed. When I've gone to any Margaritvaville, it's for some drinks and some appetizers.

Prior to the hockey game, my friends and I stopped in for a drink or two. We also ordered the big stack of nachos with all the toppings. The nachos were great and hit the spot.  We probably could have devoured another order.

I ordered a hurricane. The drink was good, but hardly as good as the hurricanes I've had in the past here. Service was very good."}
{"text":"When you hear the name Margaritaville, you expect they will have awesome margaritas, right? Well that isn't the case here. They are overpriced and just ok, not anything to get excited about....they don't even use margarita glasses. You're better off going to an authentic mexican place and paying half the price for a better tasting margarita that you can actually enjoy. My boyfriend got the ultimate margarita and it wasn't even drinkable. It was super strong which sounds great because I guess you are drinking $15 worth of liquor but tasted nothing like a margarita and couldn't drink it without making a harsh face after every sip. The margarita I got was ok. I was at least able to drink it. Food is way overpriced. On their website they had these vegetarian tacos that sounded amazing. I look at the menu and they aren't on there. I asked the waiter about it and he said they didn't have them and they just got new menus the day before. $15 for a veggie burger and fries? Come on...and $14 for cheese quesadillas that literally looked and tasted like someone took pieces of cheese and microwaved it between tortillas? I was super excited to try this place but in the end was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat on the strip. Its exiting and fun with free entertainment. There are videos on a huge screen of Jimmy Buffet concerts , balloon animal makers on stilts, the margarittaville girl sliding down and dancing around when they play Volcano, and the crowd getting into the act when they play Margaritaville. Despite this place being at the Flamingo - I give it 5 stars. I can't understand people giving this place a poor rating because of the food. If you want fancy grub, fine go somewhere else. Hello, its called Margarittaville, what did you think? Vegas has a ton of places for you to be bored at, so go pretend you're on a food show somewhere else. With that said, I think the food here is  good & def good enuf for me and have always had good to great service  Of course ill be back, in fact im probably at the table next to you with a giant balloon contraption on my head."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great.  Margaritas are strong - especially Patron.  Recommend sharing the Volcano Nachos - they are HUGE.  4 people and there were more left.  Packed with jalapeños, guacamole, and cheese.  A meal in itself and it looked like an actual volcano.  Awesome+++++"}
{"text":"We walked the strip for what seemed like hours (only about 10 minutes) and needed something refreshing. He happened upon Margaritaville when a girl handed us and card with drink specials outside so we thought, why not?
We sat in the back and ordered up a few margaritas and pina coladas. Everything was definitely tasty and if I was ever to set foot in here again, I'd want to be sitting in one of those cute little boat tables. 

We came back the next night night to have a few more tasty bevies and my only complaint is, my boyfriend had left his phone on the bar (there was nobody else sitting at or around the bar but us and a bartender behind the bar) we were in deep conversation so he didn't notice till we were about to leave, that his phone was gone. He spoke to the bartender who refused to be any help whatsoever. He wouldn't check the cameras or do anything to help the situation. We were not impressed with this at all and the're only a few directions to point at since the only people in close vicinity was us and the bartender. 

This incident kinda soured me toward these kinds of Vegas establishments."}
{"text":"Wife and I had a great evening at Margaritaville. Lots of ice cold Land Shark and excellent strong drinks. Seafood Mac & Cheese was a real hit. Loud music, cool videos and great service and free entertainment."}
{"text":"The waitress named Rene needs help with her attitude!!! The food came out cold and undercooked....overall it was a pretty terrible experience but the manager helped us cope by being very accommodating....great manager but terrible service!!!!"}
{"text":"Here's my FAST review:
Food:  Good for the price
Ambiance:  Nice boat theme
Service:  Average, not bad, but not outstanding either
Thought:  (Spoiler Alert) I hope you enjoy music by James Buffett, b/c you will get lots of it! lol"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking forward to going here after having a fun experience at the one in Vegas. This location really didn't live up. It just didn't have the same party-like atmosphere: the music was barely audible, no life-size blender, and very mediocre food (some canned papaya chunks and bland vinaigrette do not constitute a Caribbean salad, in my opinion). Maybe we got there too eariy (around 8ish) for the live entertainment, which might have made a huge difference."}
{"text":"Only giving this place a 3 because we love Jimmy Buffet.  The food is very ordinary and hard to find healthy items.  The drinks are good but perhaps overdone.  The entertainment so to speak does not deliver on the Parrothead expectation.  But Jimmy is the best."}
{"text":"Loved this place last year and plan to return in a couple weeks for more live music and dancing fun with my sister!"}
{"text":"I must admit i had high exspectations for this place when i went. Unfortunetly i left this place hungry and dissapointed. I ordered there Fajitas w/ beef, not a wise choice. After waiting a good while i was starving! when the food came the meat was real fatty and chewy and not alot of flavor. I never send food back but in this case i had to and not to mention it wasn't very hot. By the time my waitress figured everything out w/ her manager my best friend was all ready done w/ her plate of food (coconut prawns that were delicious to be fair). I will eat here again i do believe i just had a miss instead of a hit."}
{"text":"The price is right. Bring your appetite.

I was on a semi-diet while on spring break in Vegas, so I had the grilled chicken ceasar salad. It was good and filling. One of my friends had the avocado turkey burger, which she said was pretty good. My other friend had the chicken quesadilla. They gave her so much that she gave one slice to me, because my salad didn't fill me up. That's what I get for trying to be on a diet in Vegas.

We tried to order margaritas with the bottle of Corona beer in it, but they said they couldn't serve that much alcohol to one person. Something about a law... We could order the drinks separately, but where's the fun in that? I ended up having ginger ale. They had Coronas. 

Go hungry. Leave happy. The price is right."}
{"text":"Their margaritas are good and just really good. I dot remember what margarita I had but boy was it strong. I also shared the nachos with the girlfriend and we both agreed that they were pretty good. I'll have to come here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I had a group of 19 people go to Vegas to celebrate my birthday. I can not believe how well they accommodated our group. We called on Wednesday for reservations on Saturday. Originally they said nothing open but called us back in a couple hours saying \"Something had opened up\".
We arrived early for our reservation but hung out in the bar until our table was ready. It was the perfect fun environment to have fun and celebrate something. Like everyone else says the nachos are AMAZING! I had the chicken and broccoli pasta. It was nothing special but good. I loved my balloon hat with my age and proudly wore it gambling the rest of the night. It probably helped that as the birthday girl I demanded everyone else wear theirs too! haha! Overall I had a great time and out of 19 people no one had a single problem with food or service!"}
{"text":"Well, all I can say is, \"I came, I saw, I ate somewhere else.\" Thursday evening, July 27th, a little before 7:30 we check in and are told it will be a 45 min. wait. Normally, I would have left then but it was my wife's birthday and she wanted to have dinner there. Got our buzzer and had a look around. Like many have said, music WAY TOO LOUD! Decided to go walking along the waterfront to get away from all the racket. Came back after about 25 min. and told still nothing available- mind you, there were a number of empty tables. Went out for a walk again. Came back after 50 min. had lapsed since check-in and were told there were still 3 people in front of us- it's now getting on 8:30. OK. Done. Time to go now. Bye bye. From what I've read in the reviews here wasn't worth the wait anyway."}
{"text":"waiters were snobs.

music was horrible!--sorry am not a country music fan.

overall, a disappointment...and i was so excited, too."}
{"text":"Pros: Wait time on a busy Sat evening wasn't bad for a party of 7. 
Drinks were good
Waitress was friendly (not the greatest) but she had a great attitude.
Cons: Food was horrible. The crab, shrimp mushroom dip that we ordered as an app, was like mush. It tasted like someone dumped tuna fish on a plate. Nothing like stated on the menu (disgusting!)
 The \"catch of the day\" was mahi mahi, so 2 of us ordered fish tacos. What we got was crappy seasoned tilapia. 
The cheeseburger in paradise that was ordered by another person in our party was at best, a frozen patty that tasted microwaved. 
Bar staff was rude"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The food is mediocre and the entertainment is too. Because of the nature of the location I was expecting more of a fun atmosphere but instead I walked in and saw a cheesy boat themed restaurant that seems like it was old and ready for some changes. I hate to criticize people because I like to give everybody a fair chance but the entertainment here the night I went was very dreary, especially his version of the song Margaritaville it sounded like a funeral version!!! The food was definitely just blah.. Especially for the prices. Will not be returning, sorry Jimmy Buffett!"}
{"text":"Fun place with friendly helpful staff. Big place. Big noise. Big music.  I like. Burger was good and drinks came fast.  Right on strip."}
{"text":"Skip to the lou my darlin'!

Skip on past this place.  I don't have enough adjectives in my vocabulary to describe the food here.  

I wanted a pina colada.  The bar tender said the pina colada with bailey's and banana liquor was devine. LIAAAR!!!!!  I should of asked for my money back.  My bf did get the 5 o'clock somewhere.  That did knock his socks off.

If you like chain burger Applebee type joints, you might enjoy.

Save your taste buds and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had a choice of either sitting at the bar or getting a table. We took the bar option. No regrets at all. Awesome bartenders took our orders fast and delivered the food and drinks even faster. Everything was amazing. From the Fish and Chips, to the Jambalaya, and the Bahama Mama drinks to the Blue Moon on tap, there was nothing we didn't enjoy. Very glad we choose to eat here!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm a Buffett fan. Of course I had the cheeseburger in paradise. \"I like mine with lettuce and tomato, Heinz 57 and french fried potatoes, big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer!!!\".  
Yeah it's generally an over 30 crowd, but that didn't stop the 20 something's from bellowing out Changes in Latitudes through the restaurant, bar and on into the Flamingo. 
The service was good, she got a little annoyed with my wife because she was having trouble deciding what to get. 
The place was clean, dining area and bathroom. 
The atmosphere was awesome. I was ready to quit my job and move to a tropical island as any Jimmy experience should make you feel. 
Live life like a song!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and so far service is horrible. Our server was Jessica and she couldn't even serve us the water. A different server brought our water and it took her at least 20 minutes after waiting 15 minutes to take our order. We've been waiting for 20 minutes for our food now and I'm hungry!!!!! Also the margaritas are not worth it. For $10 bucks you get a small cup. So lame!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're a big Jimmy Buffet fan or just LOVE margaritas, this place is for you and you'd probably rate it 4 stars.
Not me.
I only like fruit-frozen blended margaritas and NOT smelly restaurant/bars that try too hard to resemble tropical locales that which I have actually been to--like Jamaica. 
And by smelly, I mean, \"Why the heck do I detect an aroma of stale beer water slash stale air moldy ick ick ick!?\"
I've been here before and had a burger.  Blah.  Not good, maybe even kinda boring and bland for the more than $10 it cost me. 

You're better off getting one of those Margaritas-by-the-yard at the Venetian Shops or the Alladin Shops."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been to plenty of margaritavilles in other cities and was so happy that it was coming to cleveland. The staff was amazing. That girl with the beautiful big hair, Wanda, was so polite and welcoming! The drinks were amazing. I will definitely be back. Thanks for bringing it closer to home!"}
{"text":"Came here several times.  Once at breakfast (steak and eggs), and came back in the afternoon for more drinks.  It was a fun atmosphere and girls go swimming in huge blenders...Sweet...Anyways good place to hang out and have some drinks.  See you next time Margaritaville."}
{"text":"I have 16 food allergies so going out to eat is shall we say... difficult?  I had previously been to Margaritaville and ate something safe, so I figured it would be a safe bet to go back. This time the item wasn't on the menu, so I asked the waiter and he went back to the chef to help figure out what I could eat. In the meantime, the manager came over and was incredibly friendly and accommodating. He asked how he could help, what my allergies were, if I wanted a special menu, if I had benedryl just in case something went wrong etc. It turned out that a food I thought would be safe had an allergen in it, which I would not have figured out had they not been so diligent. Rey (waiter) and Rob (manager) were back and forth 2-3 times each to make sure I made a safe order and that it was tasty. I was amazed and so impressed! I really felt like they truly cared about my safety and that I enjoyed my meal and experience. I have never had a restaurant be so helpful and accommodating. They really made me smile! I will absolutely be back the next time I am in Vegas and I encourage anyone else with a food allergy to go too!"}
{"text":"I'm a Parrothead and had never been to a Margaritaville.  We stopped there for lunch when we arrived in Vegas.   Parking at the Flamingo Hilton was easy (Valet) but the cafe is on the opposite end of the hotel - be prepared for a bit of a walk.

The decor/atmosphere was great - not as tacky or flashy as I had imagined.   Margaritaville radio was playing and it wasn't too loud.   

Food was better than I expected.  We had the Volcano nachos (HUGE!) and the \"Cheeseburgers in Paradise\".  The cheeseburgers were fine (nothing special) but the fries were great.   My one complaint is that the service was very slow.  (it wasn't crowded).    

Of course there is a massive gift shop.   Overall I was pleased and would go back for lunch."}
{"text":"They sick they didn't even show the 4th quarter of the official 1st place game.  Card vs Washington.  So lame after we spent a 70$ bill you think we deserve the game and sound of the game.  So lame so we went nxt door to the closest. BAR west.   We basically got kicked out.   So lame good thing tyre closing and the seats st second bar are way better and so is the sound."}
{"text":"There are plenty of dining options at Westgate.  On busy nights, they all have waits.  On nights when I've been in attendance, Margaritaville has had consistently shorter wait times so I have given it several tries.  And for the life of me, I cannot figure the place out.

If you're a conspiracy theorist, you probably actually believe that restaurants inflate their wait times just to make the place seem more popular.  This rumor has floated throughout the dining community for years, but I'm not sure why else I'd be quoted a 45 minute wait only to be \"paged\" five minutes later.  Miscommunication by the staff?  Sure, that's possible.  The first time.  This has happened on three separate occasions, always given 30+ minute wait times, always paged within five minutes.  This seems bizarrely counterproductive.

I dined here most recently on a weeknight following an event at the Arena.  I was given a 30 minute wait time even though many seats were open, this must have been due to a shortage of staff that night.  I chose to sit at the bar area, which was fairly wide open.  I then ordered an adult beverage.

Here is where the red alert horn sounds, lights flash, sirens blare, and people start running for cover.  

There is some kind of monkeyshines going on behind the bar at this establishment.  I don't know what kind of monkeyshines, but certainly some monkeyshines are afoot!  Order an adult beverage here, I dare you.  When you're done, order another.  Notice something?

That's right, of course you do. They taste nothing alike!  The first one was terrific, the second one nooooottttt so much.  Now order a third one, just to pad your bill and please your waiter.  Ahhhh, there's that flavor you enjoy.  Life is good!  Jimmy Buffet is taking you aboard his private yacht.  The sand between your toes feels fine.  Now order a fourth one since you're taking a taxi home.  What the devil?!  Is this gasoline?!! Seriously!  I could power my vehicle with this!  Get Jimmy Buffet the heck off his yacht and on the phone with me right this instant!

I cannot figure it out.  The drinks here are great, and then awful.  There is no middle ground.  Nothing from the bar is \"blah.\"  It either takes you away with its flavor or it makes you wince in pain.  This is unusual, even by bar standards.  Obviously, no two drinks are ever alike and even the best bars do have some variation.  But they, at least, know that you need to make the stuff using the same recipe each time!  I've had the same drink come to me in such bizarrely different variety that I'm tempted to think the bartender just made up his own stuff at some point.

So consider this your warning.  Yeah, the food is okay.  Nothing to write home about.  Burgers are burgers, nachos are tasty (although your intestinal tract will make you pay dearly later),  salads are salads.  It's all standard stuff.  Just watch out for those drinks.  If you think I'm right, let me know.  Because I'm going nuts thinking I'm being pranked."}
{"text":"If you don't know where to begin to start your \"Fun in the Sun\" I always recommend my clients and owners Margaritaville. The name itself is Epic!"}
{"text":"The Margaritas are awesome! I tried the House Margarita and the Red Bull Margarita, both were really good! There were cool performers on stilts walking round and talking to customers. I didn't eat here because the wait was too long but next time I'm in Vegas, I'm eating here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks beside The Flamingo casino.  Lots on the menu to choose from.  Good portions.  Fun atmosphere.  Nice gift shop.  Always go once when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went in at 4:30. It was not busy at all but we waited 30 minutes for our drinks. The appetizers were out before the drinks. No reason for it.  The food was decent. Humus plate was good but shrimp cocktail was over cooked.  Would not return."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the food was mediocre, to put it nicely.  The fish tacos were fish sticks in a tortilla.  2nd time there and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Definitely very entertaining! I had the best original margarita! Service was awesome! Shannen was the best server we had for the week that we stayed in Vegas, and we ate out Everyday!!! Thanks again to the staff and a great show!!! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun at this restaurant. The food was great, our waiter was very nice and the restaurant had a lot of theme going on to make it stand out. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE eating experience, I couldn't even hear myself think let alone my waiter talking to me (which he barely did) because the music is SO loud in there! Not even a fun loud! Took an hour to get our food, and my steak was completely raw when it got to me. I would not recommend this to anyone. The decorations are the only interesting thing about this place."}
{"text":"Late night dinner here. Fun eclectic decor and while I was there, live music with an energetic band that I could tell truly enjoyed the crowd. 
Pros:
     *limited menu selection, and as such specialized and uncomplicated. Ordered a burger of sufficient size for a reasonable price. 
      * Decent mixed drink selection. Mostly margaritas, obviously, but literally half the menu are their drinks. 
      * good service. It was busy, but my server treated me, despite being alone, as well as the parties surrounding me. No complaints there. 
      * live music. I just have a thing for live music and the soul that comes with it. I imagine it's not like that midday though. 
 Cons: 
       *Smaller bar areas and somewhat limited seating it seemed. As I left I noted it was about become difficult to find a table much less a server. The space is great inversely, but it must be a nightmare when the strip is full of pedestrians. 

  Overall, not a bad joint. Fun and reasonably affordable for what they offer. If you don't like noise, I'd probably go for lunch instead of during nighttime. Don't expect immediate service at all if its busy, but that's just logical. The atmosphere strives to be a pub but one square yard more for the dance floor and it'd be a club. Great for casual drinkers and fulfilling appetizers and burgers."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this restaurant. Food was fantastic and our server Rene was wonderful. She was professional yet down to earth and very attentive to our needs. Next time I am in Las Vegas I will definitely return to Margaritaville!"}
{"text":"Great service. I had the fish tacos which were awesome because they added guacamole. Lots of food for me the fish was breaded but great. We came here on a Saturday morning at 11a and it wasn't too crowded."}
{"text":"I LOVE Margaritaville.  It is a message of fun times, relaxation and just allowing yourself to kick back.  I come here three to four times a quarter and enjoy the experience thoroughly.  The best kept secret is the bar and seating upstairs and outside.  It is a little disappointing that it seems to be closed a lot, but enjoyable to watch the zombies stroll throughout the strip. The food is very reasonably priced for Vegas standards and good quality.  Must try the cheeseburger in paradise, but the fish sandwich is best on the menu.  You can always eat at the bar, which is a great place to hang out.  The \"volcano/margaritaville\" show at night is a fun little period that helps to convey the carnival like atmosphere.  I take everyone who comes to visit me to Margaritaville.  A must stop for Vegas.  Its is also connected to the link, which makes it extra cool.  Enjoy the Buffet music.  Parrotheads enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decided to have a surprise birthday party for a friend.  Called a week in advance so the table would have all our friends already seated at it when I brought her in to the restaurant. Reserved a table for 15 at 6:00 so my friends could get the cake on the table and everyone  time to get there before I got her there at 6:30.  I get a call from my friend at 6:25 and no table. I'm sitting in the parking lot trying to stall. 6:45 I can't play it off anymore, We walk up to the restaurant and my friends had to yell surprise  while sitting on the benches outside while holding a cake.  Why take a reservation if you won't go by it.  At 6:55 we are finally sat upstairs and there are at least 10 tables and a big round table open. So disappointed.  The server seemed annoyed, didn't really say anything besides are you ready to order,  WAY overpriced. Food was boring nothing different than any Ruby Tuesdays.  So disappointed.  I probably won't ever go back there again."}
{"text":"Stepped in at opening at 11 am and staff was accommodating to seat request by window along shopping between LINQ and Flamingo. Not very busy at this time which was a nice change to the busy places mid day and night! Ordered the fish and chips and beach tacos to share and get a taste off all! Great portions and food was very good! My sour cream for the tacos had great spice and the beef was well seasoned! I love the atmosphere of this place and I will be back in the evening next visit to check out the band and scene!"}
{"text":"Very good food and drinks! Went here for lunch and I would recommend trying it. I had the fish tacos with rice and black beans. My table also ordered sweet potato fries as an appetizer. Overall I would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Overpriced margarita in a small glass with very little tequila in it. Downstairs bartenders less than friendly. I will have margaritas at a decent Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The staff is nice, the food isn't. I made the mistake of going to Vegas with people who think Cabo Wabo and Margaritaville serve excellent food. 

This place doesn't even make a good margarita!! For a real margarita, you need to go to Mesa Grill at Caesars! I love Bobby Flay!!

I had a taco salad or something like that and it was underwhelming with the center lettuce being quite soggy and cold.... not in a cold crisp way, but in a not tasty way."}
{"text":"I always try to make sure I head to this place everytime I go to Vegas because I always have the best time.  The drinks are good...the food is good...always a bunch of cute and friendly guys...the mermaid show is entertaining.  It's just a really fun, laidback atmosphere.  Love it."}
{"text":"Sucks! Horrible service, to the point that I started thinking maybe crappy waitress with horrific, put-upon attitude about even the simplest requests was part of their schtick.  But it's not.  She was just pissy and rude.  But of course, because we were a large party she got her automatic 20% tip.  the food is so overpriced for the mediocre quality. For 1 salad, iced tea and an appetizer it was $40 before tax & tip. Ugh."}
{"text":"Don't eat breakfast here or have a Bloody Mary. The food was just fatty over salted buffet quality. The Bloody Mary tasted metallic and odd. The waitress was nice. Maybe the night vibe is better but I won't go back to find out."}
{"text":"Playoff game- one small TV- manager refuses to put the game on other screens. 
Not much more to say.  Food was acceptable. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"Great Food, large portions, decent price.  My only complaint is I would rather hear jimmy buffet when I go to Margaritaville instead of music that I can hear at any other restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Buffet and I had a blast at the Margaritaville in Key West, but this place is just not worth the headache.   It is packed all day long and probably seats 1000 people.  We shared some apps, wings were horrible, HORRIBLE.  The service was a complete mess.   Sorry Jimmy, I'll have to wait till I'm in Key West for another Cheeseburger in Paradise.."}
{"text":"This is a chain gimmicky restaurant, so the expectations shouldn't be too high.  However, the prices are VERY high for the AVERAGE product you receive.  Chicken quesadillas are $16?  Really?  The margaritas are just ok.  We had a check in coupon from Yelp for BOGO margaritas.  When we presented it to the waiter he became instantly annoyed, grabbed my phone out of my hand, and went to fix the check.  Upon return, he had lost my phone and never said \"sorry\" or \"thank you\".  We never had a manager visit after this snafu.  Overall average food and bad service at a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here  at 9:30pm  when the hours online said they closed at midnight. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service every time. excellent food and drinks are worth every penny. Yes it's loud - Yes it's a tourist attraction - Yes it's pricey but you're in Vegas right??? :) The crab dip is probably the best crab dip I've ever had. The drinks are worth the price you bad cause you will definitely taste the alcohol. Great time all the way around."}
{"text":"late sun afternoon ordered Patron margarita. nice view relaxing. up charged to over 22 .00 when questioned bartender deffered to manager who didnt like our attitude and requested we leave. on our way out redirected us to the back door wow wont return... how dare we complain at double charges"}
{"text":"As a LV local Parrothead, I've been here many times.  My favorite place on the strip was the 3rd floor bar, which was great for people watching overlooking the strip, as well as excellent cocktails.  I visited with friends Saturday only to discover the 2nd and 3rd floor areas are closed permanently except for breakfast.  What a shocker.  I'm an ardent JB fan, and will support his free shows on margaritaville.tv by buying Landshark and Margaritaville Frozen Concoction Makers, but I won't be back to Margaritaville Las Vegas.  Maybe some of the others locations are better and I'll still give them a try.  Just missed the Cleveland opening.  It's my understanding either a management company took over a couple of years ago or bought the restaurant.  That's when the food went to crap and I quit going to the restaurant, but when they closed the upstairs bar, that did them in.  JB must maintain some control over this terrible image, so maybe he'll force a buyback or hire another management company.  

They dumped their locals discount card a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Service not too bad but the \"signature\" cheeseburger was the disappointment. It wasn't bad, just wasn't good. No taste to it. The waitress wasn't overly concerned, just the usual \"Sorry\". Not a terrible experience but not a place worth returning to."}
{"text":"Excellent! I make it a point to stop at Margaritaville whenever I'm in Las Vegas, we had lunch on 9/19 and it was great as usual. Our waiter's name was David and he was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"june 13 6 pm, was told 45 min wait,was not told to not wander off as vibrator/light does not work in casino, doe snot vibrate hold in hand only flashes light, hr later was told table was given away, shift change from nice man to surly young girl food was over priced crap, wait staff was fine because women in our party had to talk to manager to get a table, wont ever go back to that place, screw the tourist all you like   took until 9 pm to get food after getting there at 6."}
{"text":"We went to Margaritaville for our last night in Nashville and it was 100% worth it. Our group loved it because you are able to go \"under 21,\" which worked well for our group. I had the grilled chicken sandwich, which was fantastic. It was a lot bigger than I thought but I also was not looking for anything big. Our server was FANTASTIC! Bowie was really great at working with our big group and kept everyone happy. He made sure he came back to check on us so we were happy. Overall, I had a great experience and it was a great night in Nashville!"}
{"text":"The food is below average for the strip. The only reason to goto this place is to drink a cold one and watch all the hot chicks parade up and down the strip. Having said that, I love this place."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to get away from the typical clubs on the strip. I can only take so much of the club scene before I want to go to a regular bar. I went over the 4th of July weekend and there was no line or cover charge to get in. The house band was playing, mostly hits from the '80s, but it was good."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times. The drinks are strong and the food is good. The annoying balloon makers on stilts could leave you alone but other then that its a very fun atmosphere. It gets REALLY busy on the weekend and especially in the summer but worth the wait. Price is also very reasonable so don't worry and drink up!"}
{"text":"A great place to party & have fun but not a place to get a great meal. Better off to stick to the Boat Drinks & the appetizers, at least that way you won't be disappointed. I suggest the Nachos & the Jamaican Wings. Have a couple of Margaritas and enjoy the music, the laughter and the show. Not my first trip here... nor my last. Expensive considering the quantity & the quality of the food. Recommend you pass on the Broccoli & Chicken. I've seen more meat on road kill."}
{"text":"This is not going to be a fair review. Upfront.

I visited the Margaritaville Cafe on 2/14/11. Apparently someone had \"bought-out\" the first two floors leaving only the roof-top bar available.

The line for the roof-top bar started at the top of the stairs and proceed down a hall toward what appeared to be a bus area/kitchen. The stench of stewing garbage in the hallway was over powering. About 20-30 people waited in this line. After 15 minutes, the line didn't move and the same two guys at the front were still there.

We left. Probably never coming back. Management needed to be doing some damage control and wasn't. It probably would have been tolerable if someone tried to get a couple of drink orders for the line."}
{"text":"Love this place! My food was delicious staff was prompt and delightful, entertainment was fun for my kids! Loved it all around! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Relaxing atmosphere, unique food selection, resonable prices."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here every time I make a trip to Vegas. The margaritas are excellent and the atmosphere is great. I've had almost every item on the menu, but the fish tacos and pomegranate margarita have been my favorite so far. 

Service is always great. Every visit, our waiters have been very friendly. Even when I'm with a large group, our food comes out in a reasonable amount of time.

My only minor complaint is that the entertainers who walk around on stilts are a little ... too friendly. My daughter was sitting at a table with her friends, and one of the males on stilts was very obviously flirting with her and making comments about her appearance. I understand their job is to entertain, but sometimes people just want to be left alone to enjoy their meal. This has only happened once, and I still plan to return again for the great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Being a local, We do not venture to the strip much.  Yesterday We were in the area and stopped by Margaritaville.  I am very happy I did.  First off it is a cool place that is dressed up like a beachy ocean dock area, with Jimmy Buttett music playing. Better than the atmosphere was our waitress, Randie, I have not had service this good in quite a while.  Since this was my first visit I asked for a few hints on what was good.  She started us with nachos, really good nachos, I mean really good. After this I was pretty much full.  However, she said I needed the Hamburger in paradies.  She was right.  My friend got wings and we spilt.  Wings were cooked perfect nice and crispy. And by the way my iced tea never was empty, that means a lot.  So in the end Margaritaville was really good and service was awsome. Thanks Randie and Margaritaville for a good lunch. 4 stars for food 5 stars for service."}
{"text":"I have been to couple of locations of Margaritaville. This location in Las Vegas was trendy. The staff was friendly. I got this  blackened shrimp wedge salad, the waiter informed me that they were out of wedge lettuce. I thought that was kind of odd considering its a head of lettuce sliced into wedges. So he ask me if I would take chopped up lettuce instead. The salad turned out to be EXCELLENT. The paradise island salad dressing is to die for. My partner meal was good too. We definitely recommend this place to eat. Just a tip for y'all, make the time to cut up a head of lettuce. I mean, chopped lettuce was good and all but really, the wedge salad is on your menu.. This tells me that the Chef or the staff was too lazy to sliced up a head of lettuce. Really, don't mislead people."}
{"text":"Our waiter was nice and good at refilling drinks, but the food was terrible. And there was some confusion when the bill came.

We came here because we had been to the Coyotes game Thursday and learned you could get 15% off at the restaurant and store by showing your same-day ticket.  My friend wanted to check out the shop, but by the time the game was over the store was closed.  Luckily, we also had tickets to Sunday's game, so we came early so he could do some shopping.

We decided to eat at Margaritaville before the game, since the 15% was also supposed to work at the restaurant (and it was the only place without a huge wait).  When our check came, we told our waiter we were going to the game.  He said, \"here (Jobing.com) or at Camelback?\" (Camelback is White Sox/Dodgers Spring Training venue a couple minutes away.) We said we were going to the hockey game. He told us that we couldn't get the 15% with the Coyotes ticket; we had to have Camelback tickets.  Well, lucky for us, we had just come from the Giants/White Sox game, so we did have Camelback tickets.

Next time I think I'll just get the 5 items (hot dog, popcorn, peanuts, churro, drink) for $10 at the arena and skip eating at Westgate."}
{"text":"Surprisingly the food was excellent Long with the perfect margarita. Strong and the sandwiches were so big and filling we had a late dinner. Would recommend."}
{"text":"this place is tons of fun, good food, & good prices! they have music playing and a quick little skit every hour or so. after the skit, they offer $5 specialty shots for the following 15 minutes! our server was fun and made our night! i would definitely come back next time im in vegas!"}
{"text":"located in flamingo hilton, this restaurant kinda reminds me of rainforest cafe, hard rock cafe, etc. you know, typical americanized food options, somewhat long wait, and a store in the front. well, the store does allow you to pass the time while you wait for a table. but how long can you look at merch with \"margaritaville\" all over it? 

i must say, though, that the food is definitely good here. i ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich with mixed greens and blue cheese. it was awesome. my sis had a cheeseburger that came with jalapenos, and i stole those babies and put them in my burger. HEAVEN. came with a side of yummy fries. 

when we were there, they also had this show where pirates on stilts came out, starting blowing whistles, and i guess a \"margarita girl\" was dancing around and splashing around in a pool of margarita. i don't know, it was kinda weird, i couldn't really see it 'cause the sun was shining in my eye, and the whistles were kinda annoying. but the stilts were cool, i'll give them that.

this place was just way too loud though. i don't mind people talking, but when the music is blaring through the speakers and everyone's shouting to be heard, it can really mess up a meal. it makes it impossible to communicate with anyone. 

i guess this place gets really busy though, 'cause it was reeeeeally hard to flag down our waiter. well, most of the time, we couldn't even find him! 

i guess this place is just meh...good sandwich, but not something to go BANANAS over. you might want to stay away from the jambalaya though. from what i heard, it was kinda salty."}
{"text":"I strongly don't recommend this place. Long wait and the food was terrible. I ordered Fish sandwich and my friend ordered Catch of The Day fish meal which is Grouper. The sandwich is hard and the fish is so dry and hard. It felt like they just took it out of the freezer and cocked it. My friend's entree is not any better than mine. The fish is too dry and the rice and the string bean are dry and nothing special at all. The service is so slow. After such a long time waiting for the food, we still had to wait for the server to bring the silverware because she didn't bring them with the food. If I were Jimmy Buffett, I would have been embarrassed to have this kind of restaurant after my name. Definitely a big NO!"}
{"text":"Good food for lunch and dinner but breakfast was not good. Luke warm at best and one and a half strips of bacon."}
{"text":"If there was a minus star I would give. Went there Friday to celebrate my great-niece graduation from High school. The staff was very accommodating but, the food was terrible. Everyone's fries were cold,, bread was hard and over cooked and over satiated with cheap margarine. I asked for a sample of hummus and it was cold and taste liked caulking. The prices are so high with the poor quality and skimpy portions. 
And to add insult to injury overcharged one ticket in out group by double the bill,

More like get the Nastyaritaville!"}
{"text":"Only had drinks. The Barbados bash was good. It's a sour drink but I loved it. Also had the 5 O'clock somewhere. It was also vary good. I think it's a staple drink for them. A little pricy but it was good."}
{"text":"This place is way to pricey for the bland food,all the meals are basically fried,the selection is not all that for the new location,my girl had crab cakes and it was more like stuffing inside..I will go back for drinks and a good time but I'm cool on the food"}
{"text":"Ladies were your sexiest outfit and guys, wear your tightest jeans.  My take on Margaritaville is a great place for a pickup.  Before you even get upstairs, people were hanging out everywhere.  I think this is so cool.  Though they do serve food which is not bad, the fajitas are good, we came here to experience the strip and ordered their flute margaritas so we could walk along the strip on a super hot day and enjoy being a tourist.  You can imagine it wasn't packed since at high noon, no one in Vegas dare the heat, but we did and enjoyed every bit of it.  

The service surprisingly here was good considering they were super busy and got our orders on the dot!"}
{"text":"Their buffalo wings are finger licking good!! This in itself was why I think this place is so great haha (of all reasons)!  This place can get pretty crowded but we actually sat at the bar to have a few margaritas and try their wings.  It was so good that we ordered another plate of it, yummmm!! The sauce was just right: spicy enough and the right amount of sourness (if you get what I mean).  Of course the margaritas weren't bad either.  Pretty tasty in fact.  We had a few that definitely gave us a good buzz!  Sitting at the bar you've got front row seats for their little show of a girl sliding down their indoor volcano (on a water slide)--or something like, that.  I can't really remember.  Haha, maybe the margaritas were better than I thought!"}
{"text":"The food was better than I thought it would be.  Our server Vanessa was great.  You have to try the Cheeseburger in Paradise.  Cooked to perfection.  We didn't order the nachos but we saw them coming out of the kitchen.  If you are hungry then order this item."}
{"text":"I wish I would have read other reviews before heading to this  place as the margaritas came in small glasses and even the special BLENDER margarita for $14.75 would have been regular price at other restaurant. The El Diablo burger that I ordered was a frozen Pattie that had I known that I would have ordered it well done rather than Med Rare. service was slow even though there was only a hand full patrons present.. so my family and I will only be walking by this establishment rather then throwing our money away here."}
{"text":"Nibblin on sponge cake....watchin the sub bake....

Good food"}
{"text":"I know it is a theme restaurant but I love this place. Anytime I am in Vegas it's Volcano Nachos and a Cheddar BBQ Burger and some sort of margarita."}
{"text":"I liked the tropical ambiance felt like you was on the beach instead of the dirty vegas strip. Food was really good nothing to rave about though ."}
{"text":"The best time we had in all of Vegas. I personally, don't care much about Jimmy Buffet....but this place was the best time we had all week in Vegas. Went on a Friday night (6/11/10) and had so much fun. Lots and lots of locals (which means something, right?). Met some older guys who we danced with for a while and some funny British guys. It was comfortable in my jeans and flip flops and the drinks weren't terribly expensive either. What an eclectic group of people having so much fun together! LOVED IT!
Also, the cover band (synergy?????) was soooo awesome and made our final night of vacation so splendid!"}
{"text":"Cocktails and margaritas were great, the basic cheeseburger was tasty and the fries were surprisingly good.  Was there on a Friday night and the live band was great with all types of covers from Journey to Beatles to Florence and the Machine.  I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't all Jimmy Buffet music and old people in Hawaiian shirts :)  Will go next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place last Monday night - it was closed. Things in Las Vegas close?! This is a regular stop on my Vegas haunts - a pile of nachos and a half dozen margaritas is my favorite Vegas breakfast. Bonus if you get a spot on the rail overlooking the sidewalk. Good people watching."}
{"text":"I try not to give bad reviews because I figure  no one is perfect but....I have been to  Margaritaville in Las Vegas twice. The first time was a little rough but like I said, everyone has a bad night occasionally.  I really hoped for more and just didn't get it. The last time was just a few days ago. The waiter we had was entirely clueless and seemed as if he didn't care if we were there or not. I thought maybe we arrived late and he was tired but it was only a little after 8, and this is Vegas! We ordered a couple of simple items, Chicken Quesadillas, and a salad. First, that took more than 20 minutes to arrive. The Q's were dry, the chicken actually tasted a bit gamey and I was a little afraid to take more than a few bites. A really bad flavor. The salad was OK, nothing exceptional. Why didn't I say something to our waiter? We never saw him after he dropped the food off and when he finally wandered near, I just told him to bring the check. Done with this place."}
{"text":"We waited awhile to come here so they could get the bugs worked out. Well 2 months in and not very good. We got seated pretty quick but that's where it goes down hill. Had to ask for silverware, drinks were slow.  Nachos were good, shrimp and fries came out cold. I usually love margaritaville at other locations but Cleveland needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"I have come to this restaurant the last 5 times I have been to Vegas. Volcano Nachos are the best nachos of all time! It can feed an entire family. I will always come here when I am in town."}
{"text":"pretty much what everyody else has said

atmosphere

- Smoking is as advertised.  Non smoking except for patio.  You will smell some smoke from the patio.  At least that's as advertised (unlike those fancy $$$ restaurants right next to the casinos that are supposedly non smoking but smell like ash trays). 

- pirates on stilts making balloon animals

- Jimmy Buffet videos playing nonstop

- cheezy props everywhere

- live bands sometimes


Service

- Our waiter, Tracy, was great.  Can't talk about other staff

Food

- Mediocre.  Nachos were huge.  


Overall

- Obviously it's a tourist trap.  Duh.  Doesn't mean you won't
have fun there.  It is what it is and doesn't pretend to
be anything else.  I can respect that about this place."}
{"text":"This review will strictly be about the dish I ordered and nothing else. What dish was so terrible as to warrant a single-star rating, you ask? The Appetizer Trio. 

Yes I know, it's only an appetizer dish, not a real entree. But generally, these appetizer sampler plates offer some pretty tasty food for a modest price and can be a legitimate meal on its own. But the Appetizer Trio at Margaritaville is abysmal and a disgrace to all appetizer platters everywhere.

It comes with 3 things: chips with a mushroom cheese dip, lava lava shrimp, and 2 egg rolls. But the portions are all out of whack. There's less than a handful of shrimp, the egg rolls are finished off in 4 bites, and the plate is overflowing with chips and the worst dip of all time. $15 for essentially a plate of chips and a couple random items on the side. Totally not worth it.

The dip was terrible. It didn't even taste like cheese or mushroom. Extremely bland and zero flavor. All it did was add a pasty texture to the crunch of the chips.

Lava lava shrimp was actually okay, but there was so little. They came served in this cup that was half filled with lettuce where there should've been more shrimp. Blasphemous.

And the egg rolls were decent too. Those came with a chipotle thousand island dip that was rather thick and heavy but very flavorful.

But the shrimp and egg rolls are eaten so fast and you're left with a mass plate of chips and really bad dip. Leaves you yearning for more and quite unsatisfied.

Margaritaville seems like a really fun place to hang out and Westgate is pretty poppin on the right nights. But this appetizer dish was just so astronomically horrible. Shame on you, Margaritaville."}
{"text":"5 Star for the upstairs balcony and volcano nachos! 2 of us shared one order of volcano nachos with meat (I think thats $10~$12) and we were full! The balcony is awesome at night and worth the wait and has a great view of the strip. Very romantic.

Another occasion we had food inside but the music I think was too loud. The decor inside is great. I would give that 4 Stars.

The best memory I have from this place is from 2004 on my first trip to Vegas when I ordered a margarita at the downstairs bar and I was asked if I wanted it to go. I paused and said \"excuse me?\" then I realized I am in Vegas baby! Yes, you can take your drinks to go here, its legal to drink on the street. (never legal to be drunk and disorderly however, anywhere)"}
{"text":"Margaritas were awesome, but food wasn't very good. I'd give 5 stars for drinks if possible and 2 stars for food. Atmosphere is fun. There was a live band playing when I went. You can't go wrong with a margarita here! As for the food: I ordered the shrimp appetizer which was very buttery and not that great. I also ordered a side salad that only came with lettuce, a few cucumbers, and a couple of tomatoes. My husband got the grilled chicken sandwich with fries. He said he wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. I come here for the best drinks and food. 5 times a year and for the magic show. I noticed the food has been at a higher quality and cooked perfectly. I asked the chefs name. His name was Chef David. We were at Mville last Saturday night. Chef David visited our table per my request. Great Chef. Looks to love his job and passion. Kudos to Chef David. I hope his supervisor sees this post and tells him keep up good work. I too use to be in the food and beverage industry. When I visit next month for March Madness I hope to hear that someone said job well done. Thank you to the front of house as well with great service."}
{"text":"Place was a great little place for drinks and a decent lunch. I had the Cheeseburger In Paradise. Served exactly as Jimmy Buffett's lyrics describe. Excellent! I could have been more pleased. We ate off the bow of a boat. Our server was friendly, kept the beverages topped off, and was always right there ready to get anything we needed. 

The drinks were obviously the most popular thing to order. However, it was fairly early in the morning so my husband and I passed on the booze, but really enjoyed the food. Overall I would recommend this place to any one. The cafe also hosted a live band every other evening while we were in town. The place was rockin! 

Cannot wait to go back. I am still bragging up that cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"When you need a break from Vegas, try here.

It still has Vegas prices, but you can order intelligently and save a few bucks.  The atmosphere is consistent and well-done, the beer is cold, and the food is okay.  It's not an elite restaurant, but that's kind of the point."}
{"text":"Terrible! The food is terrible. Like really terrible. Everything tastes like fish.  How do you manage to make a chicken quesadilla taste like fish?  That shouldn't even be possible.
Service was so slow.  Took forever to get a menu, order, and get food.
And it's fucking cold in there. I didn't come to the desert to have rock hard nipples from how cold I am."}
{"text":"Sunday was the 3rd chance I've given this place, becasue I like the decor and the music.  But the fact is, the food is bland, over-priced and the service is bad.  This last visit, the waiter only showed up to take our order, and pick up the check.  The food was delivered by others.  I watched the waiter walk around aimlessly like he had nothing to do, and was even standing on the main floor watching TV a great deal of the time.

I had a house margarita, which I know is not supposed to be quality, but I have a low resistance to alcohol.  It tasted like lime-flavored water and no alcohol at all could be detected.

I'm done!  Sorry Jimmy!  Better call \"Bar Rescue\" !"}
{"text":"You have to get the seafood dip! That will definitely bring me back. My boyfriend got the pull pork sandwich which he said was one of his favorite meals when we were out in Vegas. I got the turkey burger, one of the best turkey burgers I've had. It had a lot of flavor and it was huge. The manager came out and chatted with us for a little bit which I thought was nice :)"}
{"text":"Big disappointment.  Food didn't taste fresh, and it was lukewarm. Randy, our server,  clearly doesn't like his job. He just went through the motions, and had a robotic personality.  Food and drinks are overpriced for what you get. Not to mention, the drinks are lucky to have a half of a shot of liquor in them. Jimmy Buffett himself would be extremely pissed to try and get wasted away with any one of the drinks at this place. Save your money and try ANY of the other restaurants/bars on this \"strip\". Or better yet, save your money and go to Vegas Margaritaville for a much more authentic Jimmy Buffett experience."}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the years. Each time I eat there, the quality of the food and the service have deteriorated. The hamburger was too salty and the waitress not so friendly. This is probably my last time eating there."}
{"text":"The server was super friendly and timely. I got the chicken quesadillas while one friend got the coconut shrimp and another the loaded nachos. The food wasn't that good, it was okay, but the portions are HUGE! So if you've got a good appetite this may be the place for you. 

I also liked the vibe of the place. It was nicely decorated with a beach bum theme. The hosts though, weren't paying any attention and you could easily seat yourself."}
{"text":"To update my issue
I did call Tuesday and was told all Managers were in a Meeting. She took my name and number and promised a call back. Guess what 2 days later and NO CALL Back. There are way to many places in Vegas better then this place. This is the first time I have ever gone out of my way to complain, now I see, why bother. They dont care!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow. And not wow in a good way either. 

First time there. Thought it would be fun for our group of 9 to battle the cold with a trip to Margaritaville!  Here are my pros and cons:

Pros: 
1)no wait, sat immediately.
2)waiter was friendly and took drink orders quickly and was good with refills 
3) surroundings were \"cheesy\" but fun and about what you'd expect. 
4) those who had cocktails said they were strong and good
5) ribs were good

Cons: 
1) after putting in our food order it took over 45 minutes to get to our table
2) the food is not good and was undercooked and tasteless
3) live music, while appreciated, but was simply too loud for dinner conversations. 

Overall: if you're going for a quick drink then out somewhere else, that's fine. But don't go there for a meal, you'll be very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a really good lunch here. Food was tasty, as were the margaritas! Very nice waiter, and when he went on break, he came to tell us who would be keeping an eye on us. A little while later that guy came over to check on us and chatted for awhile. Felt very well cared for and appreciated it."}
{"text":"Great place for a relatively inexpensive meal.  Considering everything on the strip costs an arm and a leg!  The beer selection was good.  The margaritas were very good (and strong!).  We tried the nachos.  OMG!  These were possibly the best nachos I have ever had!  We wound up going there twice because we were impressed the first time.  The burgers are average.  If you go, go up to the 3rd floor as there is a bar and outdoor seating overlooking the strip.  VERY awesome!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good cheeseburger and fries with large portions. The service was great but the show was a little cheesy. Price for food was good and not pricey. Neat atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with 10 people. We were lucky enough not to have to wait. Very casual. They play music and have a small live show throughout the restaurant. Food is average. My fiancé and I shared the nachos. They were huge. Great to share with the table."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to hang when we are in LV.  They make e best frozen strawberry margarita's and the best part is standing on the balcony over looking the strip and people watching.  The food is also great and reasonably priced.  We make this a regular stop when we are in town. 

The new casino was open when we were there this week, it was ok."}
{"text":"The food... eh. Its okay. 

When we walked in we wanted to watch the sports game and they were not busy. So we asked the hostess if we could sit \"in the boat\" she kindly accommodated us. Since we are from Vegas we are accustomed to tipping someone if they do a great job or arrange for special accommodations. The hostess said she would get in trouble if she accepted out tip. WHAT?!?!?! 

Now as for our food server... he could have cared less about what we wanted and if we were even there. It seemed like we were such an inconvenience. We asked for bar drinks. Seemed like we asked him to go SO far to get the drinks. We wanted to share some appetizers before our entrees. He seemed like it was such a chore. When he checked back on his it was so fake I wanted to throw up! 

We were so disgusted with the service of our meal. We just left. We completely forgot to stop by the gift shop / retail store! 

From now on if I want to get wasted away again in Margaritaville, I will fight the traffic and eat at the one on the Las Vegas strip. Where we know how to give proper service!"}
{"text":"We ate here before going to see the Sharks/Coyotes game in March. It was busy- most likely because of the biker rally and the hockey game- but we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered a chicken ceasar salad which was very boring and run of the mill. I actually didn't eat the chicken at all just because there wasn't any flavoring on it and it was cold chicken. Perhaps if it was warm it would have been palatable. 
About halfway through the meal I started to feel incredibly sick and started to get a headache. I realized once we were done that a lightbulb high on the ceiling right above our table was flickering and it made me sick. I did not bring my migraine medication with me to dinner and was forced to sit through a hockey game with a terrible upset stomach and migraine. Needless to say it pretty much ruined the game. 
I would hope that the management would take better care of the building."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill from a few years ago. They now have a very strange and tacky show. The food is over priced for the lack of flavor and portions. If you are going for drinks and bar food I guess you will be fine. I liked the boat booths, but we did not sit in one. The place used to be packed and the good used to be good. On my fourth trip in 15 years I'll say, sadly I will not go back. Sorry Jimmy."}
{"text":"On a 5 night stay in Vegas my friend and I had the pleasure of at least 3 trips to Margaritaville. The Shrimp appetizer was out of this world!! The drinks, let's just say you get your money's worth. Then there is the staff. Each time we went those that we came in contact with were very friendly, went out of there way to see that we were taken care of, and seemed as though they really enjoyed their work here. Huge shout out to Pam who was our waitress on the last night. She was amazing!! Participated in our oddball conversation, never had to wait for service, and funny as all get out. Can't beat it!!  Oh, and by the way, Margaritaville, \"Bring back the Konk!!! Some didn't like it and that's fine but why punish those of us who do?"}
{"text":"We had a group reservation but when we got there it took about 10-15 minutes before we got in. I think they were unsure whether we would show up. I guess in Vegas that might be fair. This was the only downside to the meal.

The food and drinks were brought out very quickly. We had a show to get to and we had drinks and dinner for 12 people in less than an hour. They didn't rush on that account though. We never brought that to the waiter's attention.

The food portions were large and very tasty. I was very impressed with the quality of food. This will definitely be on my radar for future trips."}
{"text":"Food was great as always. Our waitress was really on top of things and super friendly.  The only reason for 4 stars... I think some of the drink prices are a little too high. But even so I will always come back!"}
{"text":"One of those places you just go because you want to. Service was decent. Food is less than mediocre. Had the grilled chicken sandwich. It lacked in seasoning and flavor. The sweet potato fries were ok. The frozen drinks were entirely too expensive for what they are."}
{"text":"We should have known not to go to Margaritaville when all the other restaurants in Westgate had long waits and we walked right in and had our choice of tables. We should have known to leave when told they do not offer happy hour on game days. 

We ordered house margaritas on the rocks, which were fine. A pretty standard house margarita. They were $7.50 each. 

We ordered Crab, Shrimp and Mushroom Dip, which was $12.50 roughly. It is a decent sized serving, but size doesn't matter because you won't eat more than two bites.  It has the look and consistency of a tuna melt, complete with melted cheddar on top. It does not taste like any of the stated ingredients, but more how what I imagine cat food would taste. It comes with Texas toast, the variety you would find in the frozen section of the supermarket for $3 for a family size box. We sent it back. 

We also had wings with the Jamaican jerk sauce. They were mediocre at best. More edible than the cat food, but not worth ordering again. They were around $11 for 8 or so wings. 

Service was poor, which is surprising considering how empty it was compared to all neighboring restaurants. 

We left hungry and found the melted cheese that comes with pretzels and nachos at the game far better than anything at Margaritaville, if that says anything. 

I will never go back."}
{"text":"Are you in the middle of an all day buzz?  Have you worked up an appetite watching your chips dwindle at the table or playing marco polo with hot babes in the pool??

Then maybe you need some NACHOS!

Behold the biggest plate of nachos I've ever seen!

http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/EJ6nGJT-y9pjtWDKGa6a1g/l

For 8 bucks, you get this heaping pile of deliciousness.  Once completed you will be ready for the obligatory Vegas late afternoon nap.  Then you'll awake with the power of Jimmy Buffet deep within you, ready for a margarita and a night filled with adventure."}
{"text":"Meh....used to be great but this time the bartenders were so focused on being showoff cheeseballs they took forever to make drinks. The bar stunk like stale beer so we sat outside, the music was great as was the people watching from the patio...but the pina oladas were just thick sweet syrup, no frozen? The margs were super sour an had little tequila....it was fun but when I look back, not really that great."}
{"text":"My brother in law is a huge Jimmy Buffet fan so we had to go, we had the nachos for a starter which were huge and the fish tacos as our main, very tasty, the drinks were strong and really hit the spot and the service was excellent, my sister got a monkey balloon hat which she was very pleased about, be prepared for a wait no matter what time you go, it gets really packed."}
{"text":"Good Jamaican Jerk wings, big onion rings, and Cuban Sandwich was pretty good. Price wasn't too bad, our server Stacy was nice. Went on a Saturday afternoon so it was busy, waited 30 mins for a table, but we sat upstairs facing the strip view so that was cool."}
{"text":"Nice to see them come to Cleveland. I was at the one in Orlando and enjoyed it. I like the atmosphere.  We went there on a Wednesday afternoon, beautiful view of the Flats. I ordered chicken strips and a side of rice & beans.  The rice and beans were very flavorful.  The problem was they brought me fish instead of chicken! Ugghh! the manager brought me the chicken and apologized.  He also took it off my bill, which was nice of him. I'll give it another try. I understand they're new.  Drink was good."}
{"text":"Just as awful as everyone says.  Service was horrible, food just ok. Never brought out our side we ordered, and tried to charge us for it. Mixed up the other sides. And acted like it was no big deal, and didn't try to fix it. Just plain bad, like everyone says"}
{"text":"Our waiter was nice.  That was about it.   Cold food, frozen Cisco French fries, cheap canned nacho cheese with pretzels, generic tasting coconut shrimp and really over priced drinks.  Drinks are good but not worth $12 for a small cup.   Inside decore could use some updating and cleaning as well.   There better places with much higher quality food for the same price."}
{"text":"So my parents were in town last week. When I told them I was going to write these reviews, they asked to not use their names. Guess they've read some of my other writing.

So when I found out The Griswalds (as I lovingly refer to my parents... gold star if you know what series of movies this is from) were coming, I got all these options and places lined up, and when I asked what they were in the mood for, I got... Margaritaville.

\"Your dad likes Jimmy Buffet.\" -- Mrs. Griswald.
\"Your mom likes margaritas.\" -- Mr. Griswald.

Margaritaville is about as touristy as touristy gets. I should know, it's somewhere I went very soon after moving here. It's smack in the middle of the Strip, attached to Flamingo Hotel & Casino, so it's never not busy. It has about three different bars, and a retail store. How much Jimmy Buffet can one person handle? If I believed everything inside Margaritaville, it's five o'clock EVERYWHERE. At all times. Whether you like it or not.

It would all be worth it if the food was amazeballs. But really it was just good. Not wow, not great, not OMG. Just good. I had a BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich and it was okay. I would have expected more barbecue sauce on a \"BBQ\" sandwich. My folks split a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and they were satisfied with it.

But how were the margaritas? I mean it's called \"Margaritaville,\" they must have bomb diggity fresh margaritas, right? 

They're okay. I've had better. Ricardo's has great margaritas. Hell, even TGI Friday's could compare to Margaritaville.

I can't say it was godawful. It wasn't. But it was nothing special, aside from the facts that the Griswalds like it, and that's a-okay with me. I'm a local, so I probably won't be going back soon. But if you have tourists in town who insist on staying on the Strip, it's not a death sentence."}
{"text":"great nachos!  went well with our pitcher of margarita.  loved the 80s cover band performance.  we were entertained =)"}
{"text":"Almost walked out when the snarky hostess lady (African American older lady in a light blue sweater like shirt) said \"your not paying attention to your buzzer\"
Well, the good part is that it was way less then the time quoted but ya know , be friendly about it. Waitress tammie was very sweet. And prompt. 
Food- overpriced of course cause on strip. 
Husband got chicken ceaser salad and said it was \"ok\"
I got the fries chicken ... said it was chicken breasts,... well it's 3 little chicken strips with some instant potatoes and canned corn. It was fair at best. 
We live in Vegas and it's our first and last time here."}
{"text":"Ordered jambalaya. Possibly the worst jambalaya I've had for $18. Rice is under cooked. It was salty. It was more runny than what jambalaya should be. It has little heat and not the flavorful kind. No okra. It was just bad. Service was fine. Nothing to write home about. Atmosphere is great and fun if that's all you care about."}
{"text":"I'm always a little nervous going to very busy places during a busy time of day because it's difficult to get good service when it's noisy and the staff are busy. This is especially important since I need to eat gluten free, and conveying that to waitstaff during the lunch rush is not easy. Add to that some iffy reviews from other gluten free people, and I was nervous enough to check ahead to make sure they could serve me. The most information I could get online were from other reviewers--nothing on their website about their ability to accomodate special dietary needs.

I was pleasantly surprised by the experience, however. While I did have to ask around before I found the place with the gluten free menues, it turned out I was just lost--they keep them up front where the hostess is. Also, our waitress was a little surprised at seeing me with the menu, but once I told her what it was she was like, \"Oh, right, of course.\" I ordered the BBQ burger off the gluten free menu, and she got the order perfect. It came out on a gluten free bun that was delicious. One of friends that was with me tried it and she confirmed that it is a very good bun. She is not gluten free, and ordered the same thing with the regular bun, so you can believe me when I tell you it was good. It didn't have the spongy or dry texture that some gluten free buns get. It was soft and fluffy, it held together nicely, and it wasn't too dense or too thick. It turns out they have a dedicated industrial bakery that makes these exclusively for this restaurant, which is unfortunate because they're delicious and would be great to stash in my freezer.

The only reasons this doesn't get five stars is that it seemed like the waitstaff don't get many gluten free customers, so this was a bit unfamiliar. On the plus side, our waitress did remember once she thought about it a second, and she did get my order right, and I had a wonderful burger with no ill side-effects whatsoever. This alone didn't push my review down to 4 stars, but in combination with other things, I can't in good faith give this a whole-hearted recommendation to other gluten free diners. 

What would have really pushed this to five stars is if the website had specific information about their ability to handle gluten free orders, and if the menu integrated the substitutions and omissions required to make items gluten free, rather than having them listed on a separate sheet. After all, the descriptions are on the main menu, and then the accommodations are on the separate gluten free menu, so I had to keep looking back and forth. Most of the accommodations would be easy to mark with a footnote like they do for vegetarians--no island butter or island rice, and substitute a gluten free bun. Additional information could be provided on the website to help other people like me decide whether they even want to bother trying a place like this. My first instinct, after seeing the website was to pick another place to go, but I don't know Las Vegas well enough to offer up a good suggestion, so I kept digging for information and found enough info to be willing to give it a try. Someone less inclined to dig for more information might give up much faster and take their whole party with them elsewhere.

Ultimately, if you eat gluten free and are willing to deal with the noise level of the restaurant, you can find something to eat here. If you are also allergic to other things, you might have to spend some more time trying to get relevant information, but it is likely out there if you are willing to dig."}
{"text":"We went for lunch in Friday Jan 31 and Priscilla was our server. She did a great job - very friendly, on top of everything. The food was great too! We will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks, Great Costumer service! the bartenders are amazing and they go all of their way to make your exerience at margaritaville amazing! They juggle and do cool tricks! One time i went there a week before my birthday and one of the bartenders congratulated me for my almost birthday lol. The only thing that id like them to change is the fact that the music they always lay is too quiet, id like them to turn the volume a little but overall its awesome and i cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place 3.5 stars. Came here on a weekday a little before noon and justified having a margarita at this time by humming \"it's five o'clock somewhere\". Yeah, I was really getting into this place and really enjoyed my time here. I agree, it is a tourist trap. The food was pretty pricey and there were no drink specials. But I ordered the nachos since I saw other yelpers suggest it and stared in awe of the interesting decorations and the TV playing Jimmy Buffet. The nachos were huge and my mango margarita was delish! Eating here was definitely an experience and I was happy to finally see Margaritaville, BUT I don't think I would come here again and again unless they dropped their prices."}
{"text":"We pay a visit to Margaritaville every time we are in Vegas. It's a reasonably priced fusion of Seafood, Caribbean and Mexican cuisine.

But it's not so much the food you are paying for. We come for the atmosphere, the partying, nightlife, live entertainment, and drinks galore!"}
{"text":"Just ate breakfast today at 10:14 am. The receptionist, Shantel, was extremely rude. She attempted to seat my husband and I at a table with a tray full of dirty dishes sitting on one of the chairs. When I asked her to remove the tray she replied, \"Someone will be here to get it. I can't lift it.\"  I then said well we can't sit here. She immediately got an attitude and said go sit over there then. I've never experienced such poor customer service. We visited this establishment the night before for dinner and was very pleased.  Unfortunately, if Shantel continues to greet patrons I'm sure they will lose a lot of business."}
{"text":"We went back for a second time just to see a band that we were friends with...same story, different night.  It's amazing to see all of the bad reviews on here and that NOTHING is being done to actually improve the experience.  I see the replies from \"Management\", but it is just a really poorly run business.  The service was incredibly slow, food is awful, cold and overpriced and drinks are bad.  How can this happen...twice?  I've tried to be a fan of this place (the one in Vegas is OUTSTANDING!) but this one is just missing the mark in every aspect of food service."}
{"text":"Margaritas were good.  We ordered chicken wings and volcano nachos. Wings were delicious. We have seen the nachos in pictures so we had to order. They weren't as big as pictures show. They tasted OK but have had better in local taquerias in bay area. Might come back and try something else. Service was good."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. I will say off the bat. The margaritas are really Good. Lots of different flavors to choose from. And all at a decent price. Food is pretty good. And the location can't be missed. Right on the strip.

Their nachos are super huge. And can probably feed a group of three or four. On weekends they usually have live bands playing. Which is cool if your into the type of music their playing. It's best to go early. The wait for a table can be pretty long. All in all not bad. And worth a visit. It can get expensive so pay attention to what you order."}
{"text":"Great game....great frieds....Great time T Margaritaville...Bartenders in the bar were the best.  They should get a raise....."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming here. Food is not good and the atmosphere is lame.  We went there on a Saturday night thinking that it would be fun. We were wrong."}
{"text":"Not only is the staff in this place completely disorganized, and unprofessional but the food is mediocre at best and overpriced. 

I asked for water 3 times, and didn't receive it until I was almost done eating. People around us who sat down way after we did received their food first, and it seemed our waitress was more concerned with talking and chatting up other tables than getting us our food while it was hot, or actually serving us. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich, and not only did the pickle look wilted from sitting out too long, the chicken inside the sandwich looked like a piece of driftwood that had been picked through by termites, and the fries were hard, chalky on the inside and cold. We ordered the taco salad, the salad itself was also wilted and soggy, and the presentation was horrendous. The meat piled on top of the salad looked like something my dog leaves in the backyard. Our other friends ordered the nachos, and found the nachos were stale. I don't think a single person at our table was satisfied with their food. When it came time to separate the checks, the waitress handed us a single bill and told us to write our names next to what we ordered. Can you say lazy? Once we did that, I handed her our cards and cash and she disappeared for half an hour. 

I wouldn't recommend this place for food or drinks. There are plenty of other places on the strip with amazing food. This place isn't worth the hype or the money.

**The manager of the store has reached out to me since posting this review and assured me this was an isolated incident, and is very embarrassed by our experience and service. The apology and concern felt very genuine, and I look forward to trying this place again with a better result."}
{"text":"We loved the breakfast so much that we stopped the next day on our trip for an afternoon treat.  We ordered many drinks with the nacho volcano and key lime pie.  Five of us were able to share the nachos which were delicious. The key lime pie is truly one of the best I've ever had!  Love, love, love Margaritaville!"}
{"text":"Check your Bill! - Looking for a spot for dinner with family that was wheelchair accessible. First table they took us to was upstairs and was at a tall table (bar stools) - nope not doable. The second table they took us to was also upstairs. Our guest was able to walk a short distance. The food was decent. The waitress was prompt and attentive without being over-bearing. Upon paying the bill we were prepared to add on a tip only to see that they gratuity had already been added on - check your bill and make sure you don't double tip!"}
{"text":"My fried and I stopped in one night for dinner last week and it was packed. We had tried to eat there the night before but didn't want to wait an hour to be served. So they told us 20 minutes and so we headed to the bar to wait with our vibrator thingy. Once at the bar a couple were just leaving to get their table and so we sat down at the bar and decided to eat at the bar. The bartender-Patty- was very nice and made sure our drinks were filled. I had the jerk chicken and it was tasty but cooked too long and was a bit dry. The veggies were also cooked too long and were limp and tasteless. I am giving this place 3 stars because of the decor, people and bartender."}
{"text":"Spent the weekend in Vegas...traveling from Los Angeles. I've always heard this place was fun and upbeat. The music and atmosphere is terrific but the customer service at this place is not good. It took a little over 20 minutes for our appetizer. And our waitress ignored us. She never offered us more drinks or anything. Their prices are pretty high...which shouldn't be a shock because it's the strip but there are better quality places for your money. I've always been interested in going to this place but my first impression was no good."}
{"text":"Food not terribly good. Very loud place. Can barely hear your neighbor or waitress. 
The show is weak, not just by Vegas standards, but by any standards. In this city there are much better places to go."}
{"text":"Very disappointing trip. Every trip to Las Vegas includes a stop at Margaritaville, today left a lot to be desired. Over 20 minutes to order, then no food for 30(ordered nachos only) table sat after us received nachos and they still had their menus. Not impressed today.."}
{"text":"Service staff is on island time, good luck finding them.

The fermenting stench from a  garbage can dominated the air above our table. 

The only seating for breakfast was in the open air deck with no cooling apparatuses. Nothing like greeting the Las Vegas morning desert sun with a cup of hot coffee at your table."}
{"text":"3 Brazilian girls, a birthday, Las Vegas and this place! It could never be a bad experience hahahaha This place is great! The food was pretty good and the waiters very cutie :)"}
{"text":"We ordered the volcano nachos last night for dinner but unfortunately I am not sure what the hype about it was. The cheese was completely dried out and the chips were too thick! It was as big as they describes it to be but the topping covered only about 1/3 of the chips and everything on the bottom were just plain and unsavory. Needless to say it was a disappointment. Then me and my girlfriend ordered their watermelon Margarita but it was too sweet and too strong for us. Then we tried to go for a birthday cake shot but it was covered in sugar as well. The service was good which is why I would give them 3 stars but the crowd is very casual and touristy which wasn't appealing to me. The inside of the restaurant was cute and the live band was good but their food and drinks are questionable and I would personally never go back again."}
{"text":"Been to Margaritaville many times over the years but recently on a visit to Las Vegas when I stopped at Margaritaville (one of my first stops) I was truly disappointed.  I don't know what is happening there but the menu is not good anymore.  They used to have a great menu, great salads and food but not anymore, everything is fried and the salads are boring.  It's really gone downhill and not sure why.  They still have good Margaritas and I liked that if you sit at the bar they actually serve you your drink in a glass glass rather than plastic, but I think that's the only positive thing I can say though."}
{"text":"Great service! Our waiter was really good and checked on us quite a bit. I ordered the fish sandwich and it was really good! Drinks are ok. I ordered the watermelon margarita a bit on the sour side but it was okay."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times since its attached to the casino @ flamingo (where I sometimes stay) sometimes i get a margarita  to-go, and other times I've chilled at the bar, i usually go for the \"Perfect margarita\" over ice along with some chips and salsa. i haven't tried any of the food yet. but the HUGE volcano nachos and the burgers seem to be heavily filling the tables when Ive come.  

The restaurant has two bars the 1st ones in the front of the restaurant and there's a (standing only) little patio which is facing out to the strip. good for people watching and catching a breeze where the weathers nice.
the 2nd bar is in the back of the restaurant by the stage/projection setup  

 For those who want a souvenir there's a gift shop @ the entry of the restaurant which sells glassware, margarita mixes, shirts,flip/flops, hats etc..

**tip #1 ** there's a 2-4-1 coupon for their  \"whose to blame\" margarita in the fun book they give you when you stay @ the flamingo. (avg out $4 ea margarita!!) which u can drink there or get it to go!   boo-ya!

**tip #2** you get more margarita when u get it a to-go cupppp :)"}
{"text":"Great food and great specials!!! Great party atmosphere! We had the Jamaica Mistaica wings and the Lava Lava nachos. The nachos will feed at least 4 people! Everything was delicious; especially the $3 margaritas and $3 shots! It's a must that we stop at every Margaritaville we see on vacation. This location did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 12. I went with salmon and sampled some steak, New York strip. The salmon was okay, and he steak I had was decent. Fun location, but in comparison to the other places I went to in Vegas, I couldn't give 5 stars. 

Over all service was good for such a large group. It's a fun place to visit....but you'll have to try some of the other places also."}
{"text":"Good service. Had the Lava Nachos with the wife. The plate is huge and could possibly feed a small family of 4. We couldn't finish it. Service was good. Pretty loud with live music. We also got a margarita and we were expecting more than the Solo cup-sized drink we got - disappointed considering the massive margaritas available everywhere else."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Wish the Outside Upper Deck were open on a more consistent basis."}
{"text":"As a Parrothead I hadto come to Margaritaville. My family and I were visiting Phoenix for the first time last summer ad we came here after a D'Backs game. Just from viewing the outside I knew I was home. Of course, I had to order the Cheeseburger in Paradise. I'd also had it at Lucy Buffett's Lulu's in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Well, tis burger was just like I remembered it, hot and juicy and good to the last bite. Service was excellent. Our waitress brought us extra palm trees and napkins to take home as souvenirs. The staff was very friendly and le me take pictures all in and around the restaurant and store. Great place. I was definitely \"living my life like a song.\""}
{"text":"Great place, great atmosphere, decent service. A good place to enjoy decent food, good drinks and a great time in general, the wait wasn't too long, they entertained the patrons, they had a lady making balloon animals for the kids, just a great family fun experience."}
{"text":"Let's just say the best thing about our dinner was our ice water. This restaurant was very disappointing. We paid $11 for chips and nacho cheese dip (like what you get at a stadium). My friend had coconut shrimp, which we both normally love, but it legit tasted like friend donuts. I had fajitas that were okay, but not great. They also had a really terrible live band that was half actually singing and half what appeared to just pretending to preform while music blasted from the speakers. It was too loud for us to even talk over dinner so we just sat there all awkward-like. Not a good experience. The waiter couldn't even hear us either. I had been to a Margaritaville in the past and really liked it, but not this place."}
{"text":"Great Bar with your usual upgraded bar food.  The food is not 5 star cuisine expertly prepared by a chef that has a manicure and a show on Food Network, but it is actually not that bad.  Margaritaville has amazing drinks, great service, and great atmosphere.  That is why you go here.  You do not really go for the food.  

That would be like visiting Hooters for the wings.
That would be like going to church to pick up chicks.
That would be like going to a funeral to pick up chicks.
That would be like admitting yourself in the hospital for the free tongue depressers.
That would be like drinking whiskey out of a wine glass (you just look stupid).
That would be like going early to a Stones concert and Michael Bolton is the opening act.
That would be like going to a library to practice drums.
That would be like going to a petting zoo on the first date.
That would be like bringing your laptop on a 3 hour cruise.
That would be like shaving your body in the winter.
That would be like getting married when she isn't even mad at you.
That would be like curtain shopping at Bed Bath and Beyond and expecting it not to suck.
That would be like going to Amsterdam and having a job interview with drug test the day after you come home.

....don't expect the food to be mind-blowing, just enjoy the bar atmosphere for what it is."}
{"text":"Since we stayed at the Flamingo, this was an easy choice to dine at. If you love Jimmy Buffet (which we do not), this place is definitely for you. Otherwise, it is just okay. Their drinks were nice and stiff. The bartenders were especially cool and a lot of fun. They did not offer many things in the gluten free area, so this limited my dining options. I did eat breakfast there several times. The corned beef hash and bacon were good. The boatmeal was good and came with a huge bowl of berries. My favorite was the nachos. The nacos were overloaded and would easily serve four people. I highly recommend stopping in just to check it out. Their casino was fun. They steer you through their retial shop and casino to exit. Also, be sure to get a seat on their massive patio. Awesome weather and people watching!"}
{"text":"This really isn't a review just a statement of disappointment. My friends and I tried to come here last Saturday for a drink on the patio at 11:45pm and they were closed. Closed on a Saturday, in the flats, before midnight?! I am so confused and let down especially since the website states that they are open until 1am. I understand if you stop serving food at a certain time but to be closed? Hmm.... Something tell me their future does not look good."}
{"text":"So i love Jimmy B, in fact I just got back from Vegas seeing him on his Year of Still Here Tour. We of course had to go to Margaritaville which we do every time we are in Vegas. As much as I want to LOVE this place, I just don't. The drinks are great and so is the atmosphere. The food though is so horribly unspectacular. If you have to eat, stick with the Volcano nachos. Their salads especially are a waste of space, unless you like lots of purple cabbage and minuscule pieces of mango! Even their quesadillas aren't too yummy and how much easier can a meal be to make...tortilla, cheese chicken? The service is excellent and friendly tho. Just drink when you are here, the margaritas are delish! You can get a 100oz Margarita in a tube... but be prepared to shell out $60!"}
{"text":"THE BEST PINA COLADA I'VE EVER HAD.


I had two. Oh man. And they were doubles. So friggin tastey!!! 

The entertainment is really odd here (balloon animals and stilt walkers and random girls sliding down a volcano into water? ) but none of that matters because they mastered the pina colada.

The texture was so perfect... almost tasted grainy as if it was made with that naked protein mango juice! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"It was a fun time at Margaritaville. Server was prompt and food was good. The only gripe was with the Hostess, she was just not inviting at all. It seemed as if we were an interruption to her day, but other than that it was good and will go back for their nachos!!! So good."}
{"text":"Nachos meet hangover. Hangover meet  nachos. The nachos were good and a massive portion as advertised. Served four of us and bom diggity were they! It's pretty busy in here, but so is the whole strip. I've had a couple of the drinks and they were all tasty. 

I picked one of the drinks and the waiter advised I get anything else haha. Good lookin bro, I guess? Anyways all in all a good experience."}
{"text":"So this place is ok for food. Service is a bit crap to be honest. As a 25 yr old asking for a beer I was told by the server at our table that I needed my passport as ID an that I wouldn't be served again without it. This came just 10 mins after being served at the bar by a bar member.

Firstly I wouldn't be so foolish as to risk taking my passport out of the hotel, but this guy was the only person our whole trip who said anything about the ID I had produced. 

No need for his attitude either when I mentioned I had just been served."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Margaritaville. They had cool decor. I thought the boat tables and volcano were cool. We shared the Jamaica Mistaica chicken wings as an appetizer. They were really good! The sauce was tasty, just a little kick - not really spicy at all. I got the fish sandwich - blackened. I wasn't expecting anything great, but there were two big pieces of fish on my sandwich. It was really good, and the seasoning was delicious. My friend ordered the taco salad, and it looked delicious. She said it was. We were both surprised that we were happy and stuffed before even finishing our meals. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The service was great, hamburgers good, nachos........ Jimmy buffet should be ashamed.  tasted like they were an hour old. Over all not too bad just avoid the nachos"}
{"text":"This is pretty much my worst nightmare: a giant restaurant with multiple bars that serves huge-ass margaritas and plays Jimmy Buffet music and videos NON-STOP. 

Needless to say, this was not my choice. Mom & Aunt wanted to go here SO BADLY, and apparently everyone else in Vegas did too, as the wait time for dinner at 8:30 on a Friday was an hour and half. 

When we finally did get in (seated at a table with its own video monitor - hooray!), we ordered and got our food approx. 45 minutes after that. You'd think after waiting for so long that anything I ate would be good, but that was not the case. The nachos and chicken strips were horrific, people. NACHOS. How do you F up nachos and chicken strips?? HELLO. 

In fact I think the only person who liked what they ordered was my aunt, who had the steak - and whose love of Jimmy Buffet made the whole place seem like Paradise to her (I refuse to make the obvious cheeseburger joke here!). 

I went here in the Spring of 2008, and just recently walked by on my last Vegas trip and it was still as packed now as it was then - all day, everyday. I have no idea what the draw of this place is, but I will NEVER be going back."}
{"text":"Came to this hot mess last weekend, and was NOT impressed.  Waited way too long before we received any service. Drinks took forever, ordered a Mai tai and received a glass full of sweet & sour. Not a great crowd, and very rude, disrespectful bouncers. Luckily there is a Saddle Ranch right across the way that ended up saving the night."}
{"text":"our waiter was a typical beach bum dufus in that he brought our drinks to a table nearby, then spaced out actually serving them us! however, once we got the drinks, my Top Shelf Marg was superb... one of the best ever. And our dinner, ribs and Cuban sandwich were really pretty good, exceeding our expectations to be sure. Not too expensive. 
Perfect way to feed the family well at Vegas, without stopping to crappy food court food or McDonalds, or without spending a ton of money at fancier places."}
{"text":"!! MORE LIKE MOSQUITOVILLE !!

Having been a Sunday evening just an hour before closing, I entered with no expectations but to sit, relax, enjoy a few drinks, and skedaddle.

Boy was I wrong....so I'll get straight to the point.

With the little time left until closing, I ordered a Long Island Ice Tea while waiting for my Chicken Quesadilla and Breaded Fish Sandwich to go.  Although not \"bad\", my alcoholic beverage tasted nothing like a Long Island nor did it have the sufficient amount of alcohol to even be considered a Long Island.  I probably would have been better off ordering a regular Lipton Ice Tea!  Still awaiting my to go order, I decide on another drink and played it safe by ordering a Heineken.  The beer was great but the food ended up.....well, let's just say, I've had microwaveable frozen food that tasted better.

My biggest gripe?  The wait.  Not because of the service or wait time but due to the constant annoyance of insects and mosquito's buzz'n around the bar/lounge.

Having to wave and swoosh away mosquito's every minute isn't what I call enjoyable nor sanitary.  A little advice.  How about closing the doors and taking additional measures in deterring insects.  I literally felt like I was in a Mosquito's Den!

Pros:  The waitress was very friendly.
Cons:  Uh, duh."}
{"text":"Volcano Nachos and margaritas.  It's an excellent combination perfect for a Vegas afternoon.  

The place itself is pretty cool in a gimmicky sort of way.  It's a chain and you can tell, it's a little chaotic running around inside, lots going on and not really reminiscent of a relaxing beach affair per Mr. Buffett himself.  It could probably use a bigger bar area or maybe just a revamping of the space so it doesn't seem that you're eating in a domed cathedral but I feel I like I'm just grasping at straws here.  

But yes, the Volcano Nachos are as good and large as advertised and drinks are on point, and if those are your expectations then you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"New menu as of December. Big mistakes. Weird combos of sweet and salty on the burgers. Dangerous crack on the wooden plate the quesadilla came on, no idea how they think this is considered safe. It's uncleanable. Can't be washed. Service took forever too. Go elsewhere, or if you must come, go with the $5 tacos. They were good."}
{"text":"We're locals to Vegas, and everyone who comes to town wants to check out margaritaville, though I don't know why we keep accompanying them. The prices are high, the food has never been amazing and the drinks, are good but the got rid of my favorite one over a year ago!!!

Yesterday we went there again with a party of 10 and I think 1 of the peoples orders came out the way it was ordered....."}
{"text":"LOVE Margaritaville.  Yes, I go to Jimmy Buffet's Concert every year but I alos love the food here and atmosphere. The tropical drinks went a little down hill since the last time but the food got better. 
We ordered the 100 ounce margarita and it was sooo yummy! For 12 of us we each had about 2 glasses and it costs $65 which is cheaper than ordering individual margaritas. 
Definitely get the NACHOS, those are to die for and are huge so if you're in a large group then order them. 
I ordered the jerk chicken with veggies and wild rice, I finished my entire plate and I never do! 
We were so full the rest of the day and everyone loved their food and the waiters are always awesome. We also didn't have to wait that long on a Saturday.
Whyyy don't we get drunk and screwwww"}
{"text":"Margaritaville las vegas...what can I say. Their menu is creative and fun. The dishes are served hot and fresh and while some may not expect great food I feel most would be pleased. The real treat here is the atmosphere.  Just an all around fun place to be with lots of entertainment: whether the on site entertainers, the wait staff or your fellow diners. The key word is fun. In a city where most are working in hospitality to make a buck the staff here seem to enjoy their jobs but honestly you will find that all over vegas. Margaritaville serves a good time with great tasting food and an experience you are unlikely to forget. The best experience is to go with friends but my wife and a I went last night and had a blast. We may just pop in for the volcano nachos!....probably mentioned in other reviews so I won't be Labour the point...but I will let you know if we managed to finish them!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here with low expectations since a lot of these celebrity/hollywood themed places turn out sucky.
It actually was pretty good.  I had a shrimp salad and my wife had burger and they both were pretty good.  The margaritas (as you would hope) were very good.
While I wouldn't go out of my way to eat/drink here, its definitely a good place to stop in for a bite while walking the strip."}
{"text":"SO I hate this place, I went on a Saturday on my Birthday with group of about ten people more or less around 9pm. There wan't a special event or anything going on and the place wasn't pact so I don't know why it took an hour to finally get seated. Once we got seated after 10pm, we ordered drinks and food. I hated that we were sat in front of the DJ, I couldn't even hear my friends talk. When our waiter Marcell, came back, I asked what exactly the happy hour specials were, he told me that I missed it and it was from 4-7. So then I pulled up the website on my phone and showed him that after 10 pm happy hour starts again. So he went to talk to another server came back and said that everything you order from now on will be half off but not what we JUST ordered. when I asked why, he said we were seated before 10. I was furious! Not only was that a lie but any other waitress/waiter would of made an exception even if we were seated at 9:59! He had some sort of power issue, and he didn't care that the ONLY reason I came here was for the specials. I would of walked out if I didn't make ten of my friends wait outside for an hour and drive to another place! We are college students, any discounts/happy hour is the whole point we even go out at times!! Besides that, one of my friends told him it was my bday and they sung happy bday to HER when I was on the other side of the table... Thanks for ruining my evening on purpose. Next time I'm walking out and you can keep your full priced margaritas. Afterwards we went to Applebee's and I had so much fun there, I got my Happy Bday and a free ice cream and not an a**hole for a waiter. I will NOT be back and so will any of my friends. You can blame the lost of service to Marcell."}
{"text":"Yelpers do not try to use the Buy one Get one free.
The bartender says that you need a coupon and no coupon appears on the screen. Very embarrassing!!!!!
Try it elsewhere because at the Coral Reefer Bar it does not work"}
{"text":"As a local, I have never been here. I pass by because it is always crowded. I finally got a chance to go in and it was a typical csino bar. I ordered a mojito but the bar did not have mint, so they gave me a nojito. I should have stuck with one of the drinks on their menu, like the zombie. My friend ordered that, it was nice and sweet. 
Prices were good for the strip, $20 for 2 drinks. It's The Strip... It could have been more! I do think they should of had heat lamps on, while on the patio. It would have been more comfortable."}
{"text":"BEST NACHOS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
other foood options i have no idea."}
{"text":"Amazing service gorgeous roof top and great prices! 
We had fish tacos, the Vegas club, and the Dillas off the appetizer menu. The food was so good we all tried a bite of someone else's. Our waitress was very attentive even though her section was full. When we come back this will be another one of my stops!"}
{"text":"We were staying at Flamingo and didn't want to go to the hotel buffet or coffee shop for breakfast, so decided to try something different and come here.

This restaurant has 3 levels and breakfast was only served on the 3rd level.  The great thing about that is it is outdoors and you have a great view of the Strip.

I had eggs benedict and it was ok.  Wasn't the worst I've had, but it wasn't the best either.  It was busy, the atmosphere was nice, the service was ok and the food was ok for the price.  

The great thing is that if you are a Total Rewards Member (Players card for the Harrah's family which included Flamingo), you get 20% off breakfast at Jimmy B's and 10% off anything in the retail store.

Not sure if I'd come back for breakfast, but one day I do want to go back for some Margaritas and good music."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch as a family with young kids the other day based on the recommendation of some friends that this is a fun place for the children. Seemed a little odd to me, but hey, why not?

Parking is available via the Flamingo Hotel and Vegas locals can still park for free for 24 hours. Yay!  It's a bit of a walk to the restaurant, through the casino from the parking garage to Margaritaville. 

We were able to be seated pretty quickly since the restaurant wasn't too busy for the lunch service. Our server was Susanna. She came by and plopped some menus on the table. Literally, a few minutes later, she came back and asked if we had drink orders ready. Since we barely had time to pick up the menu to look at it, we asked that she come back in a few. She walked away for one minute and then came right back. So we rushed to give her some drink orders. 

As we sat there trying to check out the kids menu and the regular menu, she appears again. This time she seemed rush to take our food order. If you have young kids, you know it requires a bit of patience to get everyone situated. Most of the party had decided on what to eat, but my young daughter still hadn't. So we started giving her the orders. Susanna seemed like we were wasting her time because she had to pause for 30 seconds while my daughter finally came to a decision. I'm not really sure why there was such a rush when the whole place wasn't that busy. But we were made to feel like we were inconveniencing her. Needless to say, our service experience was pretty crappy. Even after having a chat with the manager, not much changed.

There is not separate menu for lunch, which means the prices amount to the high Strip prices for dinner. At least there is a kids menu. An entree will run you from $15-20. 

The food really wasn't that fabulous for the prices. Pretty average. We had the crab/artichoke dip which was tasty. Fish and chips were average. Jr. Cheeseburger pretty large for a kid. Crab cakes tasted like they were frozen and pretty mushy. 

If anything, you're paying for the atmosphere of this place. It looked like there was a large stage in the dining area for live music, which was not utilized during the lunch service. The music is playing so loud inside the restaurant that it's hard to have a conversation with anyone at your table. 

So if you're looking for a place to drink cocktails and party, this might be a better fit. If you're looking for a good meal, this probably isn't the place, at least based on our experience."}
{"text":"We sat for 20 minutes without being greeted and the server walked by us three time as he looked at us. He was not friendly and didn't even smile. The busser had greater service than our server. We didn't catch his name, but he was caring and tried helping us. He didn't check on us to see if we needed anything. Not once. Towards the end, we felt rush because as soon as he dropped off the check, he stood a few feet away from us until we grabbed our check. The food the good, but the service was a disappointment."}
{"text":"I just have one word to say... \"Expensive!\" Food isn't that great, service is good and their Saturday night band is pretty good also."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed coming here and sitting upstairs and watching the strip AND having their famous nachos. This time we were disappointed no nachos upstairs and no misters so hot hot.   Service however was wonderful. Very friend and helpful."}
{"text":"We were walking down the strip & stopped in just for a cold drink. The service was great, the music was great and the drinks were tasty! We did not have any food, I can't comment on the food. I had the Perfect Margarita and it was very good! My husband had a raspberry frozen margarita & it was yummy too! The kids had non-alcoholic frozen raspberry margaritas & enjoyed them."}
{"text":"After all these years finally made it here. Went about 10pm Wed for my daughters 21st bday no wait we were seated immediately. Had a great waitress Cindy. We all ordered something different as usual so we could taste different things. A fish sandwich w/fries, a salad she wasnt feelin well only came with lettuce tomato and cucumber, 1pork taco &1 beef taco  beans that we had to pay extra for, what tacos no beans and rice included ludacris, and a steak that came with fries what no choice of fries mashed or baked and no veggies, 1 soda 2 margaritas $105.00. This had to be the most disappointing meal i have ever had, mainly because we had wanted to dine here for so long. I could have bought a better looking salad from the grocery store, my daughter only ate 2 bites of her fish sandwich it was made with grouper and disgusting, my other daughter said her tacos were ok beans too salty, now for my steak cooked exactly as ordered but soooo much salt it was ridiculous. The margaritas watermelon & strawberry were void of fruit flavor and alcohol. I guess we should have ordered what they are famous for the giant order of nachos which were coming out of the kitchen constantly. Give them 1 star because of the service."}
{"text":"Got the big tall plastic \"Las Vegas: Margaritaville\" goblet. Well worth the money. Would highly recommend the blueberry-pomegranate flavor."}
{"text":"Loved their papaya & guava margaritas (with salt on the rim of course). For a taste of something more...virgin, the guava juice delivered. Loved their decor - think summery beach vibe, sail boats and decks. Their nacho platter was good, but more like a meal than an appetizer. The waiters & waitresses seem to be on crack but others might call it good customer service. In the scorching hot oven known as VEGAS this is a smart pit stop for sure. 

OH PS. you can also take the alcohol to go... I did not do so, but can LA restaurants & bars please take note and do likewise? pls & thank you."}
{"text":"The live music was fun, good, funny, and entertaining! Though it was very loud and not great for conversation. The margaritas were just okay. The food was also very mediocre. I had fish tacos and they were bland with a side salad that was drenched in dressing. They also only half made my dad's salad because they forgot the cheese and dressing. 
Nevertheless, it was a fun atmosphere, and it's worth it if the live music is happening."}
{"text":"I have actually been here on both of my trips to Vegas as well as the Panama City location and it's just a fun place to eat and drink when starting the night off. It's very lively and there's usually various forms of entertainment of some sort (people on stilts making balloon animals/headgear etc. and a mermaid that slides down into a huge pitcher and does her own many cirque performance). 

The menu is pretty massive and the food is good - I wouldn't say mind blowing but I find any place that has a menu this large, you are just going to get good/okay food but I've never been unsatisifed. 
The best part is really the drinks! Soooo many to choose from! I usually get the margarita, well, since this is Margartiaville, and they have yet to disappoint! 

This is just a fun place to hang out and have some drinks. I definitely would go again here or at any of their other locations."}
{"text":"Terrible food . Don't waste your money . Drinks are good but that's about it so if you are going for food don't . Burger cold and sweet potato fries were also cold . Best thing on menu was warm pretzels"}
{"text":"I'm not a Jimmy Buffett fan but the food here is good. I've been to this one 2x, and the other one in Orlando. The gift shop is annoying as you'll only find Jimmy Buffett stuff, don't understand why people like him, he had one good song and can't sing worth a hoot. Would rather listen to the Marcarena all day long. So just be prepared to tune the music out and the big screen promo of him that plays non stop while you are there. 
Have tried the cheeseburger and the blackened fish at this location in particular. Both very very good. But for an appetizer you need to get the nachos! Awesome! Very fattening and bad for you, so make sure it's a cheat meal for you :)
Service is awesome, both times we had Chris. Ask for him and you won't be disappointed. He even gave us a tour of the place. There's 3 levels. And this one location is according to him the busiest restaurant in the U.S, maybe the world I can't remember. 
Food is well priced. Give it a try"}
{"text":"Went out with the family for a nice lunch yesterday, so we thought we would try Margaritaville. For all the hype that is behind the place, it was just mediocre. First and foremost, you have to pay for parking to eat at a restaurant that should automatically validate parking. The cheapest parking in the area was $10.00 easily. The food & drinks were way over priced, too loud and noisy that you couldn't even hear the person next to you and way too crowded. I understand its a brand new restaurant but the service was incredibly slow. We waited for over an hour to get our food. Then one person in my party had to send back a sandwich which had no meat on it. The server promised us the manager would come over to deal with it, but they never took off anything for our troubles. The food came back after everyone was finished eating. I ended up getting some kind of stomach virus from what I ate over the past 24 hours. I know for sure, I won't be back personally."}
{"text":"So it was my mother-in-law's idea to go here.  I didn't realize this place served breakfast or was open during the day to serve other stuff besides margaritas and cheeseburgers.  That Jimmy Buffet, he's so sly.  I thought to myself as we were walking here, \"Dang, I know we're in Vegas, but do we have to start drinking before 9A?\"  

So we got breakfast, thank god, and was pleasantly surprised.  My wife had the corn beef hash and I had some crazy omelet.  The price wasn't bad for Vegas but still pretty expensive.  At least here the food was decent."}
{"text":"From start to finish it was the worst experience we ever had at a restaurant. It started with the hostess who sat us. She couldn't talk to us because she was eating and covering her mouth. After sitting there with no acknowledgement from anybody( both of us had time to go clean up) somebody finally came over....pretty much too late...we should have left  then but we didn't. The nachos was A grade but the staff was a F for sure. Word of mouth will not be margaritavills vegas friend when we get back"}
{"text":"Margaritaville was exactly what I expected- a chain restaurant on the strip that serves applebees style food for a slightly higher price. Atmosphere here and layout of the restaurant is interesting in a good way. Visited with 3 friends and sat out on the patio for lunch on a weekday. It was a chilly day, so the heaters on the patio would have come in handy, but the one near us did not appear to be working. On to the menu...

After looking at the menu, I had some questions for the server. They were honest about the food, which I always really appreciate. The honesty included this- don't get the fish tacos, they are bad. I don't remember if that's an exact quote, but close enough. I ended up ordering the Caribbean chicken salad, which was fresh and exactly what I was looking for. Definitely a meal sized salad, so if you don't like left overs you may want to ask for a half-portion. I believe my friends ordered burgers and were happy with their choices overall. 

This place is the definition of A-OK. Standard food, fast service, and a convenient location."}
{"text":"Kind of like a theme restaurant/bar for 40 year olds who like to feel like they've still got it. Nothing worth going out of your way for. I stayed at the Flamingo so it was connected to my hotel, otherwise I never would have gone in. Nice view of the Strip from the rooftop deck, decent margaritas (they'd better be), mediocre cover band playin in the main room. Not bad, not good."}
{"text":"I never would have opted to dine at Margaritaville (despite being a Buffet fan), but went with a group and didn't really have a choice in the matter. 

1. The food I ordered was good. I had a fish sandwich and fries and coleslaw. I enjoyed it. 

2. The show that they put on is SO damn hokey that I stared in open-mouthed horror/amazement. It's a good place to take kids; however, it's not my cup of tea. Mostly I felt terrible for the performers who had to put on the show every hour.  The show involves performers on stilts, costumes, singing along, clapping, and a water slide.  And topped off with balloon sculpting (if that's what it's called) hats for select patrons. 

3. We had a friendly server who was patient with dealing with a large group (9 people) for dinner. She did well except for some issues splitting up the bill. 

4. The food and drink prices are pretty high and I'll assume part of that is due to the fact that it's Vegas and most of the food/drink there is costly (in my humble opinion). I thought it was overpriced, but it's Vegas so I'm not surprised or complaining. 

5.  One member of our party had a rare (medium rare, maybe?) cheeseburger and was the unlucky recipient of food poisoning a few hours after we left. There was no doubt that was what it was from. It was not from another restaurant, nor was it the flu. Based on that alone, I have to go with one star."}
{"text":"I hit this restaurant up for lunch one afternoon before heading down to the Flamingo pool.  

They have a series of amazing decks that overlook the Strip.  I thought it would be a great idea to sit out on one of those decks forgetting that Vegas is hot in June.  Don't be tempted by the bright lights of Vegas if you are eating here for lunch.  You might suffer third degree burns.  

On the more positive side, the food was great.  My wife and I were looking for slightly more healthy options after having enjoyed a buffet the night before.  We ordered a chicken sandwich and grilled chicken salad.  Both were great, especially the salad.  We even dipped our sandwich in the salad dressing.  Food prices are average for Vegas (which means higher than the rest of the world).

Our server was fantastic.  Just a genuinely nice guy who spent time chatting with us about our trip.  

I might just become a Parrot Head yet..."}
{"text":"GREAT ATMOSPHERE! If you want a getaway away from home this is a great place to feel like your someplace tropical. Get the Volcano Nachos you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This review is for the gift shop/store & the Margaritaville corporation or whatever Jimmy Buffett wants to call his very over the top, overkill of Margaritaville products. I like Jimmy Buffett. I've been a Parrothead for years. I've traveled all over the states to catch his show. I love the Margaritaville products. Or I used to. 

The last time H was in Vegas he dropped by Margaritaville to pick me up a present. He chose the insulated tumbler & the salesperson told him that it was \"guaranteed\" for life. It worked great for a couple months then started to leak. I finally got tired of looking like I drooled all over myself so I went online to find how to return/replace the product. I will tell you this: it is VERY hard finding the information regarding returns on the website. I finally located an address & mailed the tumbler asking for a replacement. 3 months have now passed and I have yet to hear from Margaritaville. No. Effin. Word. Nada. Nothing. Crickets. Needless to say I am very disappointed & disgusted w/the brand. 

When Jimmy Buffett opened Margaritaville & started coming out with merchandise I was soooooo excited. Now this \"dream\" of his has turned into a money-making machine that could care less about the quality of product they spew out. And they could care less about what the customers think. What a shame."}
{"text":"I have dined at Margaritaville twice now since I have gone to Vegas, and each time gets better. My only complain is that on Thursday night when my husband and I went all they were serving was burgers, being Vegan this was just not going to work. I can work with Vegetarian options but in this case I had no choice. Boo, that sucked. But we did return and I am glad we did! On Sunday afternoon, my husband and I head to eat around 3pm we were seated right away and within the minute the server came to get our drinks. She recommend a Peach & Raspberry Margarita in the Souvenir Blender which we went ahead and got. It was SO good! Highly highly recommend, it is not on the Menu but it should be! I got the Veggie Burger with Fries and my husband got a steak with shrimp. The food was super super good! It was totally worth going back, after my minor upset days before. Another plus was they had a live band! The music was nice, and my son started dancing in his high chair. The manager came over and asked if she could take him on stage! We agreed, and she walked him up the stage and he had his dance with the singer/guitarist. It was really nice. As always I love Margaritaville it is a must go when you go to Vegas the customer service is great the whole staff was friendly and made the experience great. The food is super good, and the drinks are amazing. Having live music is such a plus, it is nice they play music any way but live music makes it better. I also love the decor very very under the sea type of atmosphere. A must go! Highly recommend :D"}
{"text":"Sat next to the window to catch the street entertainment while munching down on some great chicken fajitas and a couple of happy hour margaritas. Staff was very pleasant. 

The only negative thing I would have to say is we stood at the reception area for a bit while waiting to be seated when we first arrived. Would have been okay but other staff members saw us and did not acknowledge us and at least say something like \"we will be with you in a minute\".

Other than that the food and atmosphere were great."}
{"text":"Wow! Jimmy wasn't kidding about The Cheeseburger in Paradise!! Seriously so #delicious! This was my first time dining here for lunch. It was a Sunday and fairly busy when we arrived. We sat on the third floor patio. The seats quickly got taken at the tables near us as well as the bar. This didn't distract or impede on the attention our server gave us. She was very thorough with making sure we got what we wanted, needed, and ordered. She double checked with my order to follow up with my gluten allergy. 
Everyone enjoyed their meals of fish sandwich, corn chowder, Cesar salad, jambalaya, and another Cheese Burger in Paradise. 
Loved the extra dill pickles on the side."}
{"text":"Packed (not their fault).  Loud (not their fault).  Drunk guy louder than everyone else and cussing every other word (again, not their fault).  But the waitress who pays more attention to the larger tables (with the loud drunk guy) then the smaller ones is their fault.. This happens a lot and it really makes me mad.  Also, the character's never stopped by our table.  They went to the table next to us but ignored us.  I had 2 girls with me and they were very disappointed.  Especially when Ariel just walked on by!!  They did catch a pirate in the gift shop on they way out but he had a bad attitude.

By the way, we were very polite and gave a good tip regardless of how we were treated.  But this will stick with us and we probably will not be visiting another Margaritaville.  Sorry Jimmy Buffet!!"}
{"text":"I first have to point out that it was not my idea to go to dinner at a Jimmy-Buffet-themed place, but seeing as we were meeting up with my sister and her boyfriend, we humored them and went along with it.  They really spare no expense in supporting hte theme - sailors and pirates on stitls, a volcano, and a gigantic margarita that we managed to end up seated right next to.  I should have been a little wary of that . . . 

The portobello-mushroom-burger-in-paradise (if you're a vegetarian Jimmy Buffet fan, of which I am only the former) was passable, the red bull margarita kept me going that night, but what really made it worth my while was the show and the spinning, scantily clad blonde on a fish hook.  She had some acrobatic moves, and how she spun around sitting on a slippery metal fish hook I'll never know, but she pulled it off.  Be careful of sitting next to the huge margarita, though, as you'll get a bit of a soaking when she slides down and gets dunked into the (reassuringly fake) giant margarita."}
{"text":"Just don't. A Wednesday afternoon, we only ordered appetizers and waited a lifetime. Go any where else. Any where."}
{"text":"I came here with some coworkers before the Cardinals game to get some food and drinks. My first impression was how hot it was inside as it seems they didn't have any air conditioning on. All the fans were going which gave it at least some air flow but all of us were sweating and fanning ourselves with the menu. We were sitting right by the door and asked if they could close it since the hot air was blowing in. They closed it, but then eventually opening the other side. Ok...

We ordered the spinach dip, volcano nachos, boneless buffalo wings, and the chicken fajitas. I could have had better food reheated from Applebee's. The food quality is very low and obviously is just reheated from a package. Not worth the money at all. 

The manager on duty was apparently stressed out because at one point she was screaming at someone on her radio to get another server to the patio. All the guests were looking at her. 

Understandably, it was game day, so I gave two stars in hopes it wouldn't normally be like this but I would prefer any other place around the arena to this one. Sorry jimmy buffet!"}
{"text":"We came here mainly for the drinks. Food was ehhh but the worse of it all was the wait time. We waited about 45 mins for food and the server only checked up on us once in between. Drinks were on the sweet side but tolerable. All in all, the only time we go to margaritaville is when we're in vegas as a tradition. Probably will stop that soon...."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all! Food was marginal at best overprice service was so so never will come back. Especially in Vegas are so many other better choices."}
{"text":"Finally went in at night and guess what? Got carded! LOL security told my friend and I that we look under 18. Say what? 

Anyways, total night and day difference. It's more happening at night of course. And cocktail service was on point. Definitely like the vibe here. Looking forward to coming back again :D"}
{"text":"Sat down for lunch....after nearly 20 minutes of no service, we left. It is so sad to have lots of employees standing around...but no one is doing their job. 
We were with 7 Star members, who will probably never go back here."}
{"text":"We stopped into Margaritaville for a little bit of American food and good drinks, and we weren't disappointed. We had 5 o'clock Somewhere which was a strong drink that I'd recommend if you're looking to get tipsy quickly. We followed that up with Don't Stop the Carnival. This was perfect for my taste for sweet drinks and was my favorite of the night. Next was Alaskan Amber which was a dark beer with great flavor and almost no aftertaste. We shared the appetizer trio which was great and could have served as a meal in itself. My favorite was the egg rolls with spicy dipping sauce followed by extra crispy chicken tenders. For dinner, who could resist a cheeseburger in paradise. They were loaded up and difficult to eat without everything sliding off. The fries served with it were average. If you're looking for good island drinks, this is an excellent choice. If you're looking for above average food, this probably isn't the right stop for you."}
{"text":"Horrible service at the bar!  Seems like the bartenders preferred the Caucasian customers better. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"I'm a lifelong boater. I've been to many Margaritavilles all over. The CLE location is consistently the WORST OF THEM ALL; Because A) THE SERVICE SUCKS (one server downstairs bars, no table service entire rooftop, NO food service upstairs), B) THE SERVERS ARE RUDE (ALL adults had to present themselves to the bartender on the rooftop to be served, they act like they don't see you for literally 20 minutes while you try to order even if they're not mixing drinks, and they run out of the lime tequila and refuse to serve the loaded Land Shark with any other tequila with lime juice). WTF. Plenty of other options in the Flats. Don't bother. RUDE. RUDE. RUDE. If you literally want to spend  of your docked time in line, never have anyone in your group catch a buzz, or generally have a good time, then come here. Otherwise, try Shooters."}
{"text":"Nachos! Nachos! Nachos! Did I mention the Nachos? Good vibes and staff is friendly enough. Usually busy so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great! However, for $130, it should of been so much better. My husband and I decided to go here for cocktails and dinner. Drinks are a little pricey. We each got one to go. His was in a blender and was $29.99, mine was in a plastic tumbler and was $23.99. He ordered the New Your Steak and thought it was cooked right, but under seasoned. I order the coconut shrimp. It came with 5 pieces of shrimp with a horseradish mango dipping sauce, those were good. My fries were cold and flavorless. My lime/cilantro coleslaw tasted like warm cabbage. No flavor. You could tell it has set out for a while as it was warmer than my fries. 
For that price I would highly suggest somewhere else. The cocktails are good, but expensive, the food... I've had better out of a freezer bag, the staff seemed great! The entertainment is a joke. I was embarrassed for them. No one seemed to know a routine nor did they seem to care.
This place was great 6 years ago, but definitely has gone down hill.
I'm giving it two stars, as our waitress was great, otherwise I would be forced to give it one star as that's the minimum."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Margaritaville. Will be our last. We just wanted dinner, no cocktails. 
We were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait, which it was. Our first table was upstairs where the sun was beating down, so we asked for another table. There were many empty tables in our section, so we chose another. (Btw, why the wait when there are so many empty tables? Short of staff? How long have you guys been in business?)
The problem with all the tables in that section is that the loud electronica music from outside (no windows) bleeds in and competes with the Margaritaville music. This goes on through your whole meal. 
My husband ordered the fish tacos. I had the grilled chicken sandwich. Took a while for the food to come. Our meals were barely warm. His black beans even had that dry film on them. They must have been sitting in that ramekin for some time. 
My grilled chicken sandwich did not seem to come right off the grill. Felt like it was cooked hours ago and kept warm. The taste and texture were ok, but it was dry. Bun was dry. Fries were barely warm. 
Our meals probably sat on the counter for some time before they brought them out to us. 
Did we complain? No. We should have. But when you're hungry you'll eat most anything. And by the time the waiter came back, then to wait for new meals, it would have taken too long. 
Our take is that the booze and (cheesey) entertainment come first here. If you just want a decent meal, forget it. No way in hell would Jimmy Buffet dine here."}
{"text":"Volcano nachos and tequila. Doesn't get much better to start the night. Good vibes and party fun."}
{"text":"People expecting gourmet food and then complaining are way off base, its a BAR. The food is on par with pretty much any chain restaurant both in quality and price. That being said, the booze, the music, and the views are why this place is cool. If you arent looking for Michelin star rated food and come down for a good time,  and great drinks youll be fine.  Awesome spot to watch boats. The East Bank of the Flats in general is cool."}
{"text":"I wasnt as impressed as I'd hoped to be when going to this place. First off, the quality of food is not worth the price that it's set at. We ordered nachos, shrimp, a cocktail and a beer and my bill was over $60.00.. but that's what you have to expect while eating on the strip. The service was good, but it was too loud to hold a conversation and the waitress literally sits down and hunches toward you in order to hear what you'd like to order. The coconut shrimp dish was not to my liking, but if you come here you should order the nachos, they are super tasty. If youre gonna spend the cash and wait to be seated might as well go somewhere else with a larger variety menu. Had an okay time but I dont think I will revisit the resturaunt."}
{"text":"Considering this place already has a 2  1/2 star rating with over 100 reviews there's not much that really needs to be said. The food and drinks are astronomically expensive. I had an appetizer and 2 drinks and it was nearly $40! I must admit both of my drinks were awesome but the appetizer was downright disappointing  and it was supposed to be their specialty. It was some sort of crab dip with these huge slices of under seasoned garlic bread. The service is a downright abomination, I literally had to flag down one of the floor managers to get our server to give us the check. I am 100% certain I'll never come here again."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed this last visit. We visit Vegas frequently and this is always a stop for us. We went on a Wednesday morning last week. We went to the bar to sit and eat.  We went greeted right away the bartender was talking to someone and just handed us menus. The food was disgusting and it took forever to get our drinks and food. It took way too long for any meal but it wasn't a busy breakfast crowd. We will go back and dine in to eat lunch or dinner. It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bite to eat and asked if we seat ourselves or wait. They directed us to a table right in the corner and told us we had the best seat in the house! I wasn't sure why until the music started playing half way through dinner and a girl gets on the end of a fish hook and lifted in the air to dance. She ended up right in front of our table right on the ledge to finish her dance. There were other performers on stilts! It was great fun! The food was good. I had the French Dip and fries. It was excellent! My husband had the Steak Taco that were a little on the small size for tacos but overall pretty good! Definitely a great place to eat, drink and enjoy a good laugh while you relax a bit in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great steak fajitas!!! I was super hungry after a night of cocktails & craps..I like the liveband and the decor, we'll def be back next time."}
{"text":"If you wanna have a good time to relax and get drunk, go see Danielle! Super cool place and very laid back."}
{"text":"Yes it's gimmicky - but isn't that why you go? This place always has a fun atmosphere whether it be for a quick drink (The Pink Cadillac is delicious) at the wrap around bar or grabbing a table late night by the stage where there is a live band, either one is a good time! Of course if you're a huge Jimmy Buffet fan there are plenty of souvenirs in the gift shop that you have to walk through to get to the bar. I almost got suckered into something because it's all such fun stuff. The food menu was quite large and the pulled pork burger was amazing!!! The bun was loaded with so much pork you would barley see it. We sat at the bar so the service was great, friendly and fast bar tenders. Oh, and try to count how many times they play \"it's 5 o'clock somewhere\"  haha those poor bar tenders!"}
{"text":"Quaint little casino and bar. Friendly, upbeat bar staff. Hit or miss on the table game staff.

Total Rewards participant, so bring your TR card. They could definitely benefit from having a few more Margaritaville ticket redemption kiosks. I got denied trying to redeem some in the Flamingo kiosks nearby, and had to walk all the way back to the other side. Not a big deal, overall, but seems silly when they're both owned by the same parent company."}
{"text":"A great place to cool down during happy hour. A friend and I shared Volcano nachos, chicken quesadillas, and we each had a margaraita-which were $4 during happy hour which are normally $7.45. We got a buzz off of one margarita and we devoured our appetizers. The atmosphere was not only bar happy but also family friendly. The chairs are all patio comfy which I enjoyed. I would recommend coming here if you have never been to snack and relax."}
{"text":"Terrible service from non existent server Derick 
Never refilled drinks
I had to get up from table and get my own take-out container 
40 minutes to get an appetizer but it was good 
The food is good service from the front desk on sucks
Hostess, bartender, server and management just said sorry but made no attempt to focus and solve the problem 
$50 for 3 appetizers not worth my time and yours"}
{"text":"When people metaphorically say they've died and gone to Heaven, they really mean they ended up at Margaritaville Las Vegas. If you want to transport yourself to an island oasis filled with booze, good music and good times, this is the place for you.

DECOR/ATMOSPHERE: It's Margaritaville- enough said. There's a huge stage and a huge volcano with a slide that leads into a giant blender cup. We were lucky enough to hear the song Volcano play and watch an entertainer pop out of the volcano into the cup and dance. It's simply fun and beachy here. They had entertainers on stilts that were making awesome balloon hats- not like ones from your average childrens party. They were making birthday ones with numbers and other ones with words.

MENU: The menu is casual and comfortable. Whether you want a Cheeseburger in Paradise or the lava lava shrimp, you can and will find something you like on it. Seriously- there's salads, sandwiches, dessert and so much more that everyone can find something they like (even your Vegan friend, Sara).

BOOZE: Overpriced, but hey, it's Vegas, so what isn't? Plus, once you win from gambling, you can afford it! Their margaritas and boat drinks are delicious. I personally love the Last Mango in Paris margarita (mango marg) and the One Particular Harbor boat drink ( vanilla rum, pineapple and blueberry puree). These drinks are not weak, either.

TL;DR: I'd come here 10/10 times and drink, eat and stay awhile."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's always a hit or miss. Somedays, you get a seat right away and somedays you wait for half an hour, I might as well go around the corner for some Mickey D's or Panda Express. Anyway, you have to get a margarita here, it's well known here. I had the red bull this time. Not bad. and not bad for the lady who celebrated her 80th birthday with her family and a shot that garnish well with whip cream looking like a penis. Boy, can she take it down. Everyone at the bar claps and laugh as she puts the whole thing in her mouth. Go Carol! Happy Birthday!

FYI, we had a server who could look like Terrel Owen's sister. I swear!"}
{"text":"I heard that the Huevos Rancheros here were really good and I was not disappointed.  The service was great as well.  My only complaint was the weak drinks.  I ordered an 8 dollar bloody mary and it did not seem to have any alcohol.   My wife's Margarita was the same way.   I went to the bar just to watch the Saturday morning bartender pour drinks.  He would only put in half a shot in each drink he made to, I guess, save money.   I heard two other patrons complaining about weak drinks as well.  My experience was otherwise great here, good food."}
{"text":"Gimmicky, impersonal and mediocre menu are the best ways to describe Margaritaville on my visit. Not sure if you have to ask to sit in the \"fun\" section of the restaurant but we were greatly disappointed when we were sat by the window in a completely empty section away from the entertainment when there was room to be had in the mostly empty restaurant on a Monday evening. I came to Margaritaville because they had an extensive gluten free menu so I was at least happy to have food options that were relatively safe. I went with the taco salad after feeling the need to eat light. It ended up being a pretty heavy salad which is okay with the typical steep-Las Vegas-Strip prices. My dining companion ordered the Mahi Mahi which he thought was just okay. We ordered two margaritas (the spicy one whose name doesn't come to mind and the mango). Both were also just okay as they seemed watered down with artificial ingredients. The entertainment was fun from what we could see all the way across the room."}
{"text":"Came to eat here for dinner twice this week. Chicken quesadilla, pretzels, and coconut shrimp were to die for !"}
{"text":"Only been once. Ordered the volcano nachos and split them with a girlfriend. 

plusses: HUUUUUGE nachos, with all the toppings you can imagine. Both of us ate it for dinner and couldn't finish it. It was really good though. Shredded AND liquid cheese?? mmm. Signature mixed drinks were tasty. 

minuses: they charge you if you want extra salsa (???), and it was INSANELY loud in there. i had to basically cuddle up next to my friend just to hear what she was saying, and even then I repeated the word \"what??\" about 892343 times. This probably makes me a crotchety old woman, but DAMN does it really need to be so loud that i can't enjoy a conversation??

Would be good for a party-evening, but otherwise I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  45 minutes for a drink!  Our friend's appetizer didn't show up?  Well the unhappy server blamed the table across the way for eating other people's food.  Ummmm we are all together including that table.  We didn't move from our seats and HOW would they get other people's food?  Saw a tip on yelp this location is closing.  Good idea!"}
{"text":"If your a Parrothead like myself then you will love this place from everything from the Parrothead decor to Jimmy Buffett song related menu items to the drinks here. Food was good and the gift shop is pretty cool but expensive. During the day it's all Jimmy Buffett music and videos but at night when I was there they had this kick ass 80's band, it was nice to be wasting away again in Margaritaville."}
{"text":"Damn, check out Hiland H.'s Nachos in the pics, that's exactly what we had and we still couldn't finish the motherfucker. 

The portions are ricockulous! 

We also had some of the margaritas, and one of them was so strong and nasty, I couldn't even finish it! That's actually pretty cool, I've never NOT been able to finish a margarita. Can I have some margarita with my tequila?  ;-)

The prices are alright, and the food is very good. STRONG DRINKS! It was walking distance from the Harrah's, where we stayed."}
{"text":"Arrived on a busy Saturday evening, around 5:30 PM and went up the stairs to be seating on the patio, up top. We had a short few minute wait and were seated in an area right next to the edge, giving up a view of the strip. 

Our waitress was an older woman, and provided us with excellent service! She really hustled, given how busy it was. My friend went with a beer to start, and I went with the 5 o'clock Somewhere. This drink was the perfect combo of rum, tequila and pineapple juice!

I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla and friend ordered the Cheeseburger in Paradise. Both were yummy and a great value for the price. We had our meals and 2 drinks each. Attempted to order key lime pie, as the waitress suggested dessert and I'm a sucker for key lime pie, but sadly they were out.

Just FYI, if you sit upstairs at the bar, there is a limited menu compared to inside...several people saw the menu and got up and went downstairs. The menu just had drinks, apps and burgers."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant and have been there several times.   This time service was slow slow slow in the bar.  Could have been that we were seated next to a giant party.   Other wise ambiance is fantastic, love the music....the decor.  Service is friendly.   Make a reservation if you can as this place fills up fast!!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be a great Casino.  Now - unfriendly dealers.  Not enough tables open.  Totally sucks!"}
{"text":"Very limited menu. I would recommend just getting a drink if you want to say you went there, but there are much better options that are not as touristy with less of a wait line."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible: after waiting 45 minutes for a table, it was another half hour to have a server acknowledge our presence, and an additional hour to finally receive our meals. The jambalaya was tasteless and of course not warm due to the hour delay from when our order was finally placed. The shrimp and grits were an embarrassment and no one finished their meals or opted to take the \"leftovers\". Never heading back, too many other great places in the Flats to take our money"}
{"text":"Terrible service and food. I had the seafood macaroni and cheese.  First they brought out the wrong  dish, then it took nearly 15min to get the food I actually ordered after everyone else was eating.  The cheese sauce was too thin and the noodles had an odd taste. Then I got food poisoning."}
{"text":"A group of 8 of us went Saturday night. I was leery based on reviews but everything was great. We got to sit in the cool \"catamaran boat\" table, waitress was awesome. Food and drinks were good and I liked the singer/guitar player."}
{"text":"Fun fun fun!!!  Great food. Great drinks. Great service. Everything you want or need in a great restaurant!  The music was fun and not loud. The staff didn't rush us and let us sit at the table as long as we wanted. The margaritas speak for themselves. I recommend the Hot Hot Hot one - it's amazing!!  

Definite stop if you're visiting Vegas or a local!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. 

Me and my girlfriend decided to check out margaritaville to see what the hype was all about. Went to the bar and eventually found 2 seats. Took about 20 minutes to even get our drink order taken we decided we were already there let's make the best of it. We were eventually asked what we would like? I ordered a Landshark and my girlfriend asked for a cider from the draft. We were informed that \"the keg was being changed\" it would be a couple of minutes\" she only wanted the cider so we decided to wait \"for the keg to be changed\". She didn't receive her cider until after I received my second landshark roughly 30 minutes. We put our order in for a Cuban sandwich and an order of chicken tenders. The chicken tenders were brought out first and were sat in front of us it was at this time that another patron of the restaurant comes up to the bar and walks away with said chicken tenders. I informed the bartender and was informed another order would be made right away and that they were very apologetic for what had happened. They also said that they would be removed from out bill because of the confusion. Eventually we received our Cuban sandwich and another order of chicken tenders. We ate our food and I immediately Asked for the bill. The chicken tenders were still on the bill after we were informed they would be removed. At this point we just wanted out and paid our bill and left. 
When we eventually made it home I reached out via the contact info on the website to inform about our experience and received no response. 

Disappointment, complete disappointment, confusion and disorganization!"}
{"text":"Went there this past Thursday, Easter weekend. Should have gotten American food or fish & Chips. Got Nachos & I Do not recommend them. there was like no meat and they weren't very flavorful but my husband & I kept eating them because they filled us up. 

My son got a kids meal, a drink was to come with it that we never received, when we asked we got it, but it was the the souvinier one that was extra. We were never asked what would we like for the one that comes with it. I wanted to ask but my husband said no so we just left it. :/  

I give a 3 star because the atmosphere is nice"}
{"text":"So... Here is my take on this restaurant after last nights visit.. cool atmosphere but that's where it ends. Our waitress was amazing. The food ... well it sucked and WAY over priced for what it was. Anyone who knows me knows I'm all about good food and fun. The food was basic and bland chain type food but at almost $20(avg) a plate for entrees  and $12 and up appetizers was ridiculous. While that's not expensive for a night out it was for the quality and taste. When I asked the waitress for her suggestion she told me what not to order instead of what to order lol. Honestly she mentioned half the menu! For the same price go to Lago or Coastal Taco or just about anywhere else in that area and have a much better meal and go to Margaritaville for the roof top bar for drinks which is why I'm at least giving the chain 2 stars.. the staff all were extremely friendly too!"}
{"text":"Super excited for this place 
I went to the soft opening this evening and was very impressed.  

Our sever Ashley was amazing.  I could t have asked for better service. 

I didn't get to experience the whole menu since it was just the soft opening but everything I tried was wonderful.  A lot of great options on the drink menu too

The atmosphere is very energetic.  Bright inside, music and a lot of TV's

The managers Amanda and Brock were very friendly and showed us around the place.  

The place is huge and had a patio and roof top bar as well.  

Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"First time at a Margaritaville and had a great time. We ordered a 100oz. margarita for 4 of us to share and it was delicious. Thumbing through the menu, there were numerous items that sounded appetizing. Then... Cheeseburger in Paradise appears on the menu. It even had the circled R, indicating trademark... as in THE Cheeseburger in Paradise. I haven't had a CIB burger since my last trip to Hawaii, and they are good. When the burger came, it was every bite of deliciousness I had remembered. I wish I paid attention to our server's name, because she was fabulous - an older woman with short hair. She rocked. I don't typically have a \"to do\" list when we come to Vegas, but Margaritaville will now be a mandatory stop."}
{"text":"First of all, I am not impressed by the response to negative Yelp reviews for this establishment. When a reviewer notes that it is too loud, service is terrible, and the margaritas are also lacking, the Yelper is told that management would \"address it\". Yet, I ran into those same exact issues, which raises the question of what management is actually prioritizing. 

We came in to eat, and were seating very quickly, which was a positive. However, after ordering drinks, we realized very quickly that the band was WAY too loud to bear. It was an absolutely inappropriate noise level for the setting and size of the restaurant. I understand if the band was the highlight, or if it was more open-air, but it really did ruin the atmosphere. As I said to my friend, \"this makes my beer taste bad.\"

After several minutes of screaming at the top of our lungs to communicate, my friends decided to finish our drinks and eat elsewhere. Our waitress, upon hearing that and presumably deciding that she wouldn't get many tips out of us since we weren't eating, pretty much ghosted us until we flagged her down when our drinks were done. The drinks were painful to finish as well - these were easily some of the worst margaritas we have consumed, especially since we went to Barrio earlier in the day. They were too syrupy yet somehow at the same time not flavorful either, cheap-tasting, and absolutely not worth the price. 

All-in-all, it was an extremely negative experience and we were absolutely aching to finish our drinks and leave as soon as possible. Don't waste your time here - it doesn't have the same vibe as other Margaritavilles, and it's really just a waste of time. Maybe we weren't drunk enough to appreciate the blaring noise, occasional shrill feedback, and atrocious band, but we are now struggling to accept the fact that we collectively wasted over $30 on drinks here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for day drinking. Feels like Nashville in Cleveland. Rooftop bar gets full early."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday!!

Very Loud, awesome food and awesome drinks!

all i can say is.......wasting away again in Margaritaville"}
{"text":"We had breakfast on the patio which was nice view of the strip. We all ordered the meal that had eggs, bacon, hash browns and pancakes. The food took awhile to get to us. Other tables sat after us received meals prior. 
The scrambled eggs were terrible way over cooked. The rest of the meal was good."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas and you want something close, quick and chain like - then come here.  I had the fajitas and they were pretty good.  Place is Buffet style like other locations and connected to a casino.  It won't knock your socks off - but it's clean, reasonable and polite.  What more can you ask for?  If you have more money go spend it - I suggest Cut - if you have less there is a Denny's down the street.  Watch out for the manic beard outside.  Walgreens is nearby if you want to buy liquor for your hotel room."}
{"text":"Over-hyped and Under-delivered.  

A group 6 of us went to this location after the Undy Run in the Flats.  Even though there were probably 20 or 25 people waiting outside, they didn't open the doors until exactly 11:00.  Not great customer service.  Manager should have opened early since this was a scheduled event just about 1000 ft. from their location.  It was a bit chilly and windy outside and most of the folks waiting were commenting about this.

The interior was nice, but then it's relatively new.  The decor is typical southern Florida Keys.  A bit over the top.  It's like whomever did the design didn't know when to stop.

Both drink and food were way overpriced.  Two of us had the Jambalaya.  The dish really needed some broth.  It was way too 'dry'.  It's as though the rice had adsorbed all of the moisture.  Two had hamburgers and both agreed that they were okay but not something that would impress you.  When you pay $14 for a hamburger, you expect it to be better than the average burger.  These were not.  Just average.  One person ordered lots of onions on his burger and received his burger with no onions.  I won't go into detail about what he was told why they were missing, because it was really a bizarre answer.  She should have just said, \"I forgot them\".  The giant onion rings were okay, but not great.  

Overall, a very disappointing dining experience, except for the server.  She was good.  But I wouldn't recommend this place unless you like overpaying for the name because the drinks and food certainly aren't worth it.   Guess their overall rating on Yelp is legitimate."}
{"text":"A group of coworkers and I chose this location for our monthly dinner hoping to enjoy the upstairs patio overlooking the lake. From the beginning, we were let down. The hostess told us that they were not opening the patio that evening and we would have to dine on the main level. We ordered an appetizer which came out in a timely manner. We then placed our dinner order around 6:30. To make a LONG story much shorter, we left at 8:30 with half of our group (the other half gave up on getting our food) and 3 of nine meals, which we realized weren't even what anyone at our table ordered. In the meantime between ordering and leaving, the waitress and the manager made us to believe multiple times that our food ticket was due next. \"Coming right up\" is a relative term for the staff there. The manager kept saying there was no excuse and that she had called her GM with no solution to the problem. Ultimately the manager did comp our meals and provided $25 gift cards at our request--although most of us vowed to never return. There were some staff who were very gracious and understanding of our complaints, but others who made blatantly rude remarks as though all of the issues of the evening were the guests' fault. With dining experiences like this, I don't anticipate Margaritaville will become a Cleveland staple anytime soon."}
{"text":"After walking up and down the strip for hours, a friend and I decided to stop in and have lunch.  The service was pretty lousy for a Thursday afternoon, and the food was worse.  I ordered a simple cheeseburger and by the time I finally got it, my friend has finished his entire meal.  The burger was extremely bland as were the fries, and pretty costly considering there are a million other restaurants just seconds away.

The only thing I enjoyed there was a frozen drink or two, but those were so overpriced that it killed the enjoyment.  If you're in Vegas, there are several places that are better and worthier of your money."}
{"text":"Ate at Jimmy Buffett's for the first time and was disappointed. Menu seemed very limited and was expensive for what it was. Food was unremarkable and I would not eat here again.

Not bad just nothing worth making me visit again. It may be fun late at night for drinks and a snack though."}
{"text":"Hands down, probably in my top 5 of WORST restaurant experiences ever. 

We had a party of 20. They wouldn't seat us together or even in the same room. We had 4 tables at every corner of the restaurant. The place has three levels of seating. Two tables ended up downstairs, I ended up on the second floor and I have no clue where the rest of our party ended up. After an hour and a half wait, we were to hungry to round up everyone and go somewhere else. The wait staff was not accomodating or apologetic at all. The food was less than mediocre and the prices were average. 

I will never ever ever ever come back.... not even if you paid me. It was so disappointing."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch and some refreshing beverages and had the best nachos and mojitos ever! Will def be back next time we're in town :)"}
{"text":"I've been to several locations and this one was by far te best. The bartenders were friendly who made really strong margaritas. My favorite part is the cat walk that you can drink your drinks on and yell at people on the street walking by. Always a good time."}
{"text":"Went here twice. The first time we stopped in for breakfast and I had chicken & waffles which were delicious. The second time we stopped in was for lunch. My chicken was very undercooked and I ordered something else. Didn't receive any discount or anything whatsoever for the mistake, just my replacement order. I'm pretty shy so I don't usually ask for those things, but I think it's horrible that I didn't receive anything for such a mistake that could cause health problems from the restaurant themselves, one shouldn't have to ask for that, it should just be standard in case of an event like this. At least the service was good and the place seems like fun at night"}
{"text":"We ventured into Margaritaville on a late Thursday afternoon on 4-24-14 during Happy Hour.  Decor was awesome! Not busy, should have been a sign for us.  My husband wanted to sit inside but near the outdoors.  We let the Hostess know but she seated clear on the other side in a corner!  This started my husband off on the wrong foot! 

We each ordered a drink.  I, the $5 House Margarita special which was not very good but considering the price.  I've tasted lots better. It came out in a regular standard glass!!  One would think eating at Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville it would be in a Margarita Glass for the theme and fun!!   I then gave my Margarita to my husband and I ordered the Fins to the Left. The color of it was pretty and the name was what I was paying for but the taste was just not there!  I wasted $7.50 on that drink!!

We ordered Lava Shrimp for our app. which was quit good, delicious in fact but it went down hill from there.  My husband said his Jimmy's Jammin' Jambalay
 was very  good BUT over priced for the amount he got, should have been around $14 or $15 instead of the $18 he was paying.  We had to wait to find someone to ask for Hot Sauce for his Gumbo as it got cold. Here comes paying for the name thing again!  I ordered the Blu Cheese Burger since the waitress said it was their most popular and ordered it MEDIUM.  Fries were good BUT my burger was DONE and DRY!!  Hardly any Blu Cheese on the burger!!   Worst hamburger I ever had and to think this is Jimmy Buffet Hamburger in Paradise?  I think NOT!!  I did not let the waitress know since it would be another 20-25 minute wait for another even though they were not busy.  I just went ahead and ate it.
 
We have been trying to get here for 3 years to eat since we live almost 1 hour from there and it was a major disappointment.  We should have gone back to Yardhouse where the drinks, food and service was so much better!  If we come back, it will be during Happy Hour and we will get several orders of the Lava Shrimp and only beer. Something basic.  Not wasting my money on a Margarita when they do not know how to make them in Margaritaville and served in a standard everyday glass. !!  Once again, we were only paying for the name!!"}
{"text":"What can I say.  I needed to kill a couple hours before flying out of this crazy city. The result...I am buzzed and had an awesome burger. Sit at the bar meet people from around the world, and drink..,works for me. Drink here, eat here, meet and greet here...sad to leave but I have a plane to catch...to reality."}
{"text":"PRISCILLA is hands down the Best server!!!!! She gave my fiancé and I top notch service....from her positive attitude to her wonderful suggestion, she made our FIRST TIME there feel really special- I WILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"The only thing that saves this place is the location.  Right on the strip near the Flamingo, across from Bellagio.  Right on the corner.  Can't be beat.

I was feeling fruity and got a strawberry daquiri here once.  It was way too strong and really wasn't the iced adult beverage you expect.  Instead it came out of some slurpee type dispenser.  Please put a little effort in if I'm paying 10 bucks!  Is a blender too much to ask?

Margaritaville is a good rendezvous point to start the night because it's easy to find/get to.  Don't stay too long unless you like being butts to nutts with tourists.  Maybe it's slightly better during the week?"}
{"text":"Desert-dwelling Parrotheads and tourist-trap lovers can rejoice now that a Margaritaville outpost is open in Glendale's Westgate. My cute suburban parents have an affinity for anything remotely tourist-trappy [perhaps that's a Freudian explanation of my Yelpiness].  So I knew they'd be all over this place during their most recent visit.  

After the Cardinals game we wanted to wait out the unbearable traffic jams so we indulged Pops and sauntered into this bar.  Beyond the raucous post-game crowd and the Saturday night crowds we saw the day before, we were  startled and shocked to see a stilts-walking clown (I am not fucking kidding) going table to table making balloon animal figures. Besides the dining area and elevated bar, you can choose from the outside patio and upstairs tiki dining balcony.

After spotting a gigantic mound of nachos in the shape of a volcano we decided we must have that.  So we ordered up a round of margaritas on the rocks with salt and the \"Volcano Nachos\" and some of the Florida delicacy known as Conch Fritters.  The margaritas were surprisingly blah.  I can name a dozen places in town where you can find better margaritas - Sam's Cafe, Barrio Cafe, Los Dos, Dos Gringos to name a few. People obviously must not come here for the margs.

These Volcano Nachos were bigger than my face.  I mean it was huge.  Much better tasting than what we had next door at Fox Sports Grill and definitely more memorable.  

I foresee Margaritaville becoming a landmark here in Glendale. The restaurant faces out onto the Jobing.com Arena doorstep and Westgate fountain-style plaza so it's in a prime location, but having been dragged to the ones in Las Vegas and Key West - it's just doesn't have that sense of place. [wah-wah sound here]"}
{"text":"Often times Margaritaville seems to have an older crowd. That doesn't really bother me, and I know that the reason is because of the live music. Kids these days just want DJs. I, however, think younger people would LOVE it. The live music is fun, and it is generally a band doing cover songs, so everyone will know the songs. In between sets they play traditional club music (hip hop or whatever). It is free, which I love, and the drinks are generally pretty strong. They have food and plenty of seating, which is also free to just sit at if you can find an open table. There is plenty of room to dance, and it doesn't seem like anyone is trying to have s*x on the dance floor. The people at Margaritaville are just there to have a good time, which is exactly what we go there to do. I just want to hang with my girls, meet some funny people, and act like fools. Margaritaville makes that happen while still being cool enough for everyone in our group. Don't forget that there are a couple bars as well. So getting a drink is easy, and the decor is fun; very nautical."}
{"text":"This place is good

They have good fried shrimp and French fries.

They have amazing balloons for your head.

Longest wait ever"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but the prices are very high. Their margaritas can be very strong which is nice since they are moderately priced. Our server got really busy and it took us a while to get our checks and leave. They have a show every hour which can make things pretty crazy while trying to enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and the food was pretty good. It wasn't busy but they only had 1 server on our side which caused a bit of a wait. The waffles were really good and the gravy on the chicken was just the right amount. The steak was a lil tuff (it may have been the knife) but the flavor was good."}
{"text":"I used to come here regularly. And from my rating, you can see that that has changed. The last two times I came were complete disasters. One time isn't really their fault but it tells you the type of people you may encounter (though you would probably encounter them anywhere). Anyhow, let me get back to the story. It's a laid-back place with a live band you can dance to. So I put my sweater on the speaker (which I've done many times before) so that I could dance without the extra bulk. To make the long story short, my sweater was stolen. I actually approached the girl who argued with me and ran off with it. And I'm not kidding about that. I admit I wasn't quick enough to go after her because I was in shock, I definitely did not expect that at all. The workers of course could not help. Anyhow, it sounds petty but I like that sweater and it's ridiculous that that even happened. I actually didn't come for a couple of months because I was still annoyed by that.

Anyhow, I finally did decide to make another visit... Ok, so onto the actual place- food, drinks, and music. All were terrible the last time I was here. In fact, I brought some family and friends and was completely embarrassed by how bad it was. They had a new band and they were terrible. (The old band used to play the same songs but at least they did a good job). It took me a while to figure out what this new band was playing, which ended up being \"Yeah\" by Ludacris. That's a pretty distinct song and it's bad that I couldn't even tell what they were playing! Well, since we finally found a table, we figured we'd hang out even with the terrible music. So everyone ordered their drinks. I ordered my usual margarita on the rocks. Wow, that was also terrible. Seriously, is it possible for everything to change that much in a couple of months? In fact, it became somewhat of a game as everyone tried everyone else' drink to see whose was the worst. I think mine won. Actually, I can't even comment on the food because I think we gave up after the drinks. (I used to always want the nachos but I was afraid to try that this time).

So I definitely do not recommend this place and will not come back (and haven't since these last experiences)."}
{"text":"Well my Cuban sandwich borderlines cold. My perfect margarita was shy of a half a pint. Very small for $10.00. The cup full of ice was delicious. When in Cleveland go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I hate this place. I hate it because I could be checking out a different restaurant but there I am, always coming back for those freaking nachos! Ok, next time i will try and skip Margaritaville but I won't make any promises!"}
{"text":"We met my uncle for a late unch at Margaritaville.  It was cute and touristy!  We had the pomegranate margaritas on the rocks. They tasted pretty good, but the glasses they were served in were just plain drinking glasses.  Not impressive for the price.

We had the land shark battered cod, fries and coleslaw.  The cod was AMAZING!!!!!!  Although a bit pricey, it was a huge helping of fish. So good!!!!!  The fries were not very good and the coleslaw had cilantro and lime in it, which sounded interesting, but just tasted weird,   All in all, it is worth an occasional visit."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. 15 cent wings on Tuesdays are nice but this place is very off with drinks: twice I got margaritas here and each time, I was overcharged. And the last time, my drink was in a little plastic cup, because they ran out of glasses! I paid more for LESS alcohol. Not a good look."}
{"text":"We decided to get some food and margaritas here on our trip to Vegas. Hands down, had the best margarita of my life.... I got the watermelon margarita. The servers weren't the friendliest and the nachos we got were just okay, but I'd come back again for the drinks! Prices were expensive but that's Vegas for ya."}
{"text":"Volcano Nachos!!!! The best nachos anywhere hands down. They are HUGE! the chicken tortilla soup is really good as well. Great selection of alcoholic drinks, fun atmosphere, always a good time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wandered into Margaritaville after checking out from the Flamingo.  We had time to kill before our flight and I'd read good things about their nachos.  We were seated right away, and our server was cool about us changing tables to be closer to the soccer match on one of the TVs.  We ordered the nachos and fajitas.  Our server warned us about how big their nachos are, and steered us away from ordering anything else.  We're very grateful that he did, because there is no way we could have eaten any more than the massive pile nachos we recieved!  We gave them an honest try and even though we were pretty hungry, we only got through about half of the plate.  They weren't the best nachos I'd ever had, but they were tasty, covered in jalapeños, and a reasonable priced (around $15, which isn't bad for Vegas).  If you order them, plan to split them with 2-4 people and order a side of salsa  to go with it.

Also, the margaritas were tasty, as they should be."}
{"text":"Ok. Great service. Still what I call Bar Food. Not all seating is good for their entertainment. Try something else..."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place of novelty.

My friend and I shared a plate of the Chicken Pasta. The portions are big enough to share. You won't feel super stuffed when you try to squeeze into your dresses for the evening! Hehe. :) The pasta was pretty good, you can also substitute the chicken for shrimp too.

Of course, you can't go to Margaritaville without trying out their margaritas! A few of my friends ordered the Tropical Fruit Margaritas (Mango and Guava). They're on the sweeter side, but pretty yummy! Although you'd probably have to drink a couple more to get a decent buzz, haha.

This restaurant has a sort of tiki/Hawaiian sort of atmosphere. In between our meal, the staff put on a little musical number... complete with a dancer sliding into a pool (or giant cup) of water! Even though it is a little cheesy, eating here was entertaining!"}
{"text":"Ah Jimmy Buffett---sort of your parents' Sammy Hagar.
This place runs expensive, and it took a long time to get served due to seemingly failing to have a host on staff from the direction we came in (later on, after they held my left-behind credit card kindly for me and when I returned for it, I realized the host dwells in a different location to enter in). Looking for a really cheap meal, we had the volcano nachos which was just such an excessive amount of food, probably fit for 5 people, so make sure you bring at least 3 people or the prices won't make sense. You're supposed to get drinks here, but their items seemed pricey so we skipped the drinks. Am I missing something about the Jimmy Buffett dynasty that makes the menu so expensive? I guess you're supposed to buy the drinks so that you can eat that quantity of food huh? 
Inside there is non-stop video footage of the fun-times man himself on his namesake island in Florida...all around a good place to hang if this kind of thing makes you nostalgic, not really my kind of thing, but I won't knock it for that. I guess, if anything, Jimmy Buffett reminds me of sing-alongs in grade school and the way your parents envisioned the \"good life\". At any rate, the nachos were filling, so mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Boy, I REALLY wanted to like this place... But what a shitty experience! 

We were seated quickly, which was expected because it was a late Sunday night and there was only 3 of us. I know it's Vegas, but it wasn't poppin' or anything. We were seated by the window, which normally would be fine, but the AC was on full blast directly at us. It was nice for about 2 minutes, then we were all freezing.

We waited 10 minutes before seeing our waiter, which shouldn't have happened seeing as they were slow (and not understaffed). We ordered waters and said we'd need just another minute with the menus. About 5 minutes later, our waiter brought the waters. At this time, we asked to move to a table not under the AC. He pointed to a table and said once it was clean, we could move over there, and he walked away. A few minutes later, we moved ourselves over. 

It took 15 minutes before our new waiter stopped by. Again, not okay. We ordered dinner and an appetizer. The appetizer came promptly, and we were told the food would take about 30 minutes because I had ordered a steak (cooked well), which is understandable.

Finally we got our food, over 45 MINUTES later. I went to take my first bite of mashed potatoes and just about lost my appetite.... I FOUND A HAIR. Gross. 

At this point, my mom was pissed. She asked to see the manager. He came over and was very kind (wish I would have gotten his name). He apologized multiple times and said he'd have the kitchen rush me a new one (after making sure that's what I'd like to happen). 20 minutes later, I got a new steak and sides. (Funny how it came twice as fast that time....) 

I was super disappointed, though. The steak was not good. I know Margaritaville isn't a steakhouse, but for $26.99 you'd think they could cook a decent New York Strip. 

The ONLY redeeming factor at this place was the manager. He even took my dish off of the bill. 

Definitely don't recommend going and won't be back! Bummer!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Service slow, not very friendly. I had shrimp linguine, shrimp were good pasta under cooked, sauce was watery/bland. He had Asian shrimp salad very good. Kinda one of those went, tried, done! Not very appetizing to return."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment.  I've been going to Margaritaville since it opened, taking friends out for the amazing mountain of nachos. Parrot Heads Beware, at 9 PM the extremely loud obnoxious bam bam bam dance music starts, and there is no more conversation. Taking some lawyer friends out for drinks and conversation, it was over when the music started.  You couldn't hear the server, and were yelling across the table to communicate.  Nothing like the terrific bands they had in the past. If the management thinks putting in this obnoxious music will increase business, they need to go out a look at their client demographic.  I will not go back as long as they continue to ruin the Jimmy Buffett atmosphere.  In my view, a horrible business decision.  Dozens of guest around us were all upset at the volume and music choice in this once clearly themed venue."}
{"text":"Margarita was not weak!  Hey you are at Margaritaville!!!  Yay me!

My husband & I started by sharing the crab & mushroom dip with bread.  It was cheesy & good on the bread!  Yum!

Then we decided to share the Volcano nachos!  We are both eaters but could not finish it!  Glad we shared!

Is it 5 star food?  No but it was enjoyable, filling and in a lively environment!  We were on vacation!!!

Entertainment was guys (ship captain, pirate) on stilts and a girl in the lime green tank."}
{"text":"We started with drinks and all they had was over the top sweet. We had them take it back and make different ones. The Volcano nachos are delicious, it will easily feed 4 people alone. the restaurant was packed however our service wasn't good. screwed up our order twice and took forever to even serve us. The little show they put on was lame but the guy that made our birthday balloons was hilarious. Overall its an ok place but don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"I checked this place out since it is famous and one of the new hotspots in Cleveland. To start with the positives- the location is great. There is a nice outdoor deck which looks out on the lake and happening street on East Bank Flats. It is a huge, modern space and looks like a good place to host parties or have large dinner events. 

Now for the negatives: I had a Watermelon Margarita and the Perfect Margarita on ice. There were no frills, boring and tasted like the fake sugary mixes. The Volcano nachos were tasty - for me the menu was basic American bar food. I am disappointed that such a large establishment with the name Margarita in it could not provide a quality margarita. Just saying...."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new location. Been to the one in Vegas numerous times. Let's just say I wish I was in Vegas. 

The only good things about this place were there was no wait when we got there. 7pm on a Wednesday. Even though it was a Wednesday this place should've been packed since it just opened. 
The other good thing was our waitress. Can't remember her name but she was awesome. 

Now the bad. The prices are astronomical for what you get. I'd expect to pay these prices at Greenhouse Tavern or Flying Fig but this is a chain restaurant. Nachos were good but for almost $17 it wasn't near worth it. Also ordered a Taco salad. It looked tasty but had almost no flavor and was ice cold. Sent it back to the kitchen and after 20min received another that was maybe 5 degrees warmer than the first. Just dealt with it at this point. Like I said before it was almost flavorless. And at $13.50 I'd rather eat one from Taco Bell and save $8. 

Bill came to almost $40 and I had no alcohol. I tipped well because the waitress was really good. I was hoping for this to be a good new place I could grab a bite with the wife or friends. Guess not. 

Oh and it costs $7 just to park. I'll just stick to Fatheads."}
{"text":"Bring Margaritaville to LA!!! 
When I go into Vegas I enjoy drinking!!!! 
I am a fan of margaritas. I prefer just the house margaritas on the rocks with salt. The blended ones give me a brain freeze. I will admit that last time I came here I was a little buzzed and everything tasted good. But overall the margaritas are good. 
When it comes to the food I remember sharing a chicken sandwich with my friend. It was enough to be shared. Again, tasted great when you've had hours and hours of drinking. One of the first times I went there I got the nachos and they were HUGE! I'm not kidding -- you can feed a family of 4 easily. They are just to big and lack flavor. 
Service was fast and friendly. It does get packed but a little short wait is not all that bad. Music is pretty cool and just a great atmosphere overall. Great place to start the night!!!"}
{"text":"Service is completely awful. Came around noon and didn't leave till 3 because of how long food and drinks took. Don't ever come here for lunch or dinner. No sense of Mexican food. Management is also poor.  They're margaritas aren't worth the price. I was so excite to try this place, and it was the WORST experience in Vegas."}
{"text":"Definitely not what we expected, the margaritas were okay, nothing to really get worked up about. I was excited to try the calamari. When we ordered it the bartender said they didn't carry it."}
{"text":"Decent food and a fun time.  Better than what you would expect from your typical cheesy themed vegas bar/restaurant tied to a celebrity name.  Good place to grab a drink and a bite to eat with your friends before a late night.  Try to go when the waterslide performer is there."}
{"text":"Loaded Landshark!! great service. Good food. It's a bit pricey but it's Vegas. $19.99 for Tilapia?!?! Thats a bit high."}
{"text":"Recommend! Ask for an outside sest or a window and watch everyone walking the strip. Kathrine was our server. She is Amazing. We only stopped in to hydrate (margarittas) and a snack. Service was great. No line at lunch but it is Wednesday. Entertainment was free! ! We sat at the corner table to watch the strip. The sober and not sober and those pretending to be! Vegas baby!! Thanks so much for the service.
OH and they give military discounts HOOAH! & HOORAH!!"}
{"text":"Annual Vegas trip always puts us here once or twice. We were there twice this trip and have very different experiences so I'll have to give it two ratings and average it above :)

We spent a lovely evening there, great service and food. It was breezy and my drink tipped over on me. Even though it was more than half gone I was given a new one at no charge. I give this visit 5 stars.

Went back a few days later for breakfast and it was a different story. Crappy service!!  I mean, really awful.  I don't think anyone should have to ask repeatedly for additional water or coffee, keep it comin'!  We had a coupon and she couldn't figure that out either.  We were disappointed.  The only plus side was that the food was good."}
{"text":"good regular bar food.

they have the \"perfect margarita\" at this location only - i don't know why the other locations don't have this one, but its the only reason i go to margaritaville

we go to vegas once a year and i always stop in for a couple \"perfect margaritas\".

i used to live across the street from the one in new orleans, so i've eaten there enough to know i'll never love the food.

but that one margarita is worth it every time."}
{"text":"This makes me sad. I'm such a Parrot-head and saying anything negative towards Buffett just makes me want to shed a small tear. Unfortunately I'm rating Margaritaville and not Jimmy, though so here we go. 
The atmosphere is fun- the decorations cute and it's a very large restaurant. It also has a very overpriced gift shop out front. They also have people in stilts walking around making balloon figurines, which made me feel a little awkward. Also the servers just aren't ever very friendly. This last trip, we had empty drinks, stacked plates, waited forever for our check all while 5 employees, manager included were standing right behind us chatting and watching football. Customer service is not a priority here folks. 
I've been here about 5 times and never have I really enjoyed it. This last trip will however, be my last. I'm done trying to wait for it to get better.
We didn't have to wait as long as usual, which is rare. There usually is a long wait time, but we generally come before some event so Westgate is packed anyhow. We were sat in some weird corner booth upstairs and were facing a corner wall and it was hot as all hell. We asked to move and one would have thought we asked for a million dollars, but our waitress finally agreed. Once we could breathe at our new table, she finally got our drink order and it took forever to get them. My glass of wine was the smallest glass of wine in the world. It was about the size of a shot. I also ordered a soda and it sat empty the entire dinner experience. 
Our salads and food came out together- after about 50 minutes. The table was really crammed since it all arrived together. I didn't particularly want my salad after that long and didn't eat it because the entree seemed more appealing by this point. 
The food was OKAY. That's the only reason for the second star. I had mac and cheese and the husband the \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\". He had wanted the \"cold draft beer\" to go with it- but they have NO draft beer. They did have Heinz 57, which was at least fun. 
The prices here are extremely high. WAY too overpriced. Almost 60 bucks for mediocre food, small drinks, rude service and an overall lackluster experience. 
Sorry Jimmy! We won't be back, but will look forward to seeing you in concert if you ever come back to AZ again. It's been a while!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to love it here. It was only okay. We went in on a Friday night at about 10 with a group of 8. The server took forever to take our orders, bring our food, refills, etc. The food was only okay, just warm not hot, when it came to the table. The music was great and it had a terrific vibe. Maybe it was just not our night there."}
{"text":"We just returned from our first, and I think our last, experience at Margaritaville. We were seated rather quickly and the staff were all friendly. However the server took just shy of 10 minutes to come to the table for the first visit. We placed drink orders and an appetizer order. Timing however broke down as the server did not return until the appetizer came to the table along with glasses of water. The margaritas we ordered came after we reminder the server that we had placed drink orders as well.

The appetizer was okay. Taste and quantity were fine for the price. However the lack of attention by the server placed us in a somewhat sour mood. The margaritas were rather small for the price. Similar to other reviews, I would say they were so-so on taste, but overly sweet and small for the price. 

Our meal came out shortly afterward (timing between the appetizer and entrees was fine); however one of the dishes somehow got translated from a linguine to jambalaya. The server blamed the kitchen for the mix up which honestly seemed to be on the server. Of the dishes that came out, only one (a blackened fish sandwich) was finished. Two dishes (jambalaya and a salad) were sent back. The jambalaya had some questionable items that didn't appear to be fully cooked. The salad looked to be a pre-packaged salad that was left in the heat all day and cooled off with soaking in dressing. The final dish was the linguine which the person at our table only took a couple bites and then boxed up for later.

The server took the salad off the bill, but everything else remained. Food quality and service does not match the cost. None of the service staff were rude, but the server just was not attentive or accurate enough to justify the prices. There are other places in Cleveland that charge 25% of Margaritaville and provide higher quality food from what we had tonight."}
{"text":"The wait for a table can be long.   If you're downstairs.   Go upstairs and jump in line.   We were seated within 5-10 minutes (downstairs where it was hot and muggy, we were told an hour).   We were seated outside on the deck overlooking the Strip.  The weather was perfect and it was SO nice!   

The food was good.   Pretty much what you'd expect from a chain type restaurant.   The servings were HUGE, so consider splitting one dish.  Hey, you can always order more if you're still hungry, right?

Great service.   We were moved to a table against the railing when I requested instead of back against the wall, which was super nice of them.  Pirates on stilts were hobbling around making balloon animals for random tables.  They skipped ours.  Boo!

Loved the classic rock they had playing over satellite radio.   Not too loud, so we could still have a conversation without being drowned out."}
{"text":"We love stopping at all Margaritaville's in the places we like to visit. I was quite surprised that the Margaritaville in Las Vegas only has a happy hour from 2am to 10am; most Margaritavilles we have been to have a normal happy hour. We were disappointed about the happy hour but love the atmosphere! We were at the bar around 3:30pm and there was maybe 10 people at the bar, I'm sure there would've been more if there was a happy hour to match most of the surrounding bars!"}
{"text":"Dined and drank at Margaritaville in Vegas last night.  The blackened fish sandwich was excellent and the hot crab dip is tasty as well.  I know its a kitchy, commercial, chain restaurant, but the experience is always enjoyable for me."}
{"text":"Margaritaville has specials every night of the week on food and drink. A large draw for the college crowd is their 25 cent draft night on Wednesday, but others will enjoy their 10 cent wing night on Thursdays. The highlight of this bar has to be their karaoke night. Since the bar doesn't attract only one type of person, you're likely to get a mix of music as well with everything from Oasis to Kanye West with a lot of cover band favorites thrown in."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars, I would. My friends and I came in today and the hostess told us it was a 30 minute wait when the place was literally empty. She was just too lazy to push tables together for us. She sent us upstairs and told us to push our own tables together in the bar. When we started doing this, a blonde middle aged woman was extremely rude and clearly pissed. Lucky for us, she was our server. I'd tell you her name, but she didn't introduce herself. She immediately chose to be disrespectful. She told us I'll be with you in a few minutes and I kid you not, she stood in the corner yawning and glaring at us. We literally got up and left after about 10 minutes. She started laughing as we got up. I have never experienced such an unpleasant human being. This woman was nasty. I am not one to post yelp reviews, but I could not let this one slide. Horrible waste of time!"}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch here before and very good burgers and fries.  Today had breakfast the griddle combo I would just call just standard breakfast food not disappointed or wowed. I do recommend coming for a burger though nothing better then a cheese burger in paradise!!"}
{"text":"If you go to Vegas a lot then this place is worth stopping in once and a while. The food is ok. They have lots of cocktails to choose from. Other than that its nothing special."}
{"text":"Margaritaville, more like mediocre-ville! 

The place can be summed up in two words: tacky and tasteless."}
{"text":"It's 5 o'clock somewhere...  

Margaritaville is conveniently located on the corner of the the strip and the walk going back to the Linq area.  We stopped in here to grab a bite before a show.  The hostess was less than thrilled to seat us...  but at least that is where the bad service ended.

Clarissa was our waitress and was awesome!  She took great care of us always making sure out drinks were filled, made some small talk and had our food out in a snap!  She was very informative about the locals discounts in the Linq area.  Like I said, she was great!

We decided to split the volcano burger.  It was topped with volcano chili, jalapeños, fritos and cheese.  It was just ok.   The burger was overcooked to our liking.  Surprising it was a little dry even with all of the toppings smothering it.  Fries were good and crisp.   I was glad that we split this meal because it was more than enough food.   Did I mention we started with the pretzels and cheese?  Maybe that's why I was so full.  The pretzels were soft and delicious.  I wouldn't mind getting them again.  

This was just one of the places I've been wanting to try.  Food is ok and thanks to Clarissa, the service was great!"}
{"text":"Food was not worth the price. It was like something you'd get at a crappy bar. Margaritas tasted okay but were tiny. Nachos were big but looked like a drunk teenager made them. Burger was decent though. Pass on this place. Oh, it also gave me and my friend hot diarrhea. So yeah skip this place."}
{"text":"Watermelon margarita. Keep it coming! Darn my low tolerance for alcohol! But I really do enjoy their watermelon margaritas. The appetizers here are pretty good too, but that nachos is ginormous! 

Margaritaville's a nice low key way to spend the night. And if you're staying at The Flamingos, you don't even have to leave your hotel!"}
{"text":"The service here was the worst I have ever experienced...There were 5 of us and we all had a tremendously poor experience.  One group member needed to refill their drink on their own at the bar (after waiting for the waitress for 10 minutes), when we asked, the waitress wouldn't allow us to order food after an initial 14 minute wait (and then after coming back at a 25 minute wait asked us if we had enough time to choose).  When one member of our group told her that we were on a tight schedule, she instructed us to not order anything complicated or well-done.  We will not be back.

Oh yeah, and the restaurant was 1/2 empty."}
{"text":"Atmosphere here is awesome, drinks were top notch and the food was delicious. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Good Food. Ok service.  First let me say we sat in the bar, because of my sister.  Not what I would have done.  Since i don't drink.  So since its a bar its very loud...  full of people drinking and running around..  Ok I know it supposed to be that way.  Las Vegas is for party people and drunks so if your in that group go now...  Otherwise go some where in Boulder City or not Vegas."}
{"text":"First of all let me say I am not a \"parrot head\" and mildly like Jimmy Buffet's music. The one star is for the Ahi & the nice attentive server. Food was mediocore at best. The music was too loud for any interaction with everyone at the table. I really don't like screaming my order at the top of my lungs to the server."}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his birthday. The experience was good, but the food is ok. I'm a local so to venture out to a tourist trap is rare. I love the casual atmosphere and the decor was very thematic to the whole margarita vibe. The drinks were very good. I had the bluberry pomegranate nojito and my husband had some banana flavored drink.

We ordered the nachos and seafood mac and cheese. I guess after a hangover the food is excellent. The nachos definitely was getting ordered everywhere and it was fun to eat. The mac and cheese though was so so. It did have a good portion of seafood but I just felt it was a little bland. 

Service is excellent so no complaints there. Our server was very polite and attentive, and our food came out in a timely manner. 

I do have one pet peeve, the design of the restaurant makes it hard to find the actual entrance."}
{"text":"Not only was the food great,  but also the entertainment was special.  We loved our experience there."}
{"text":"came here with my girlfriend for my birthday she was mad at me but thats neither here nor there. the service was quick and the servers were friendly. we order the shrimp trio and the beach chicken tacos. the chicken was soooooo juicy. the margaritas were also strong. the food was so good we came back the next day. i highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First, it is more of bar and it is right on the strip so we were not expecting much.  The atmosphere is fun.  We had a great table and watched the entertainment on the street while others were paying to take pics with the characters ; )
We shared some nachos, which were decent. I had the chicken Cesar salad and it was really good.  Others had cheeseburgers and everyone said they were good. Margaritas were sweet and weak.  Service was good.  We would go again if close by, but would not go out of our way."}
{"text":"What can I say about the place went here the first time we went to Vegas in 2014 and must I say I fell in love with place.  First I love the theme and decor of this place makes me want to talk pirate talk...also I like that they actually on the strip so if can choose to eat your food and drink your drink while viewing the strip.

The prices are a little steep...but the food was great I had a Bacon Cheeseburger and it was cooked to profession.  My drink that I had was really good and strong.  I had a good buzz to leave with.  Our server was awesome she made suggestions to us since we never at there before and she was very fun.

This will be one of the places I will go again when I'm back in Vegas"}
{"text":"While atmosphere is fun and unique the food is a different story.  I took my family there and found the prices to be quite high for what you get.  $ 15.99 for a southwest chicken salad.  The was minimal chicken and toppings compared to picture. It was 90% lettuce. My daughters burger had a piece of wax paper from the burger which makes me wonder if it is a frozen patty. Also I don't like restaurants that you have to be careful to walk in because the floor is so greasy from the staff exiting the kitchen. Would go back for the patio and a drink but would not eat there again. Too many good places in Cleveland to eat to justify going back for a meal."}
{"text":"This is a very fun themed restaurant. If you're a Jimmy Buffet fan at all it's a Las Vegas must! It is often times very busy, I'd suggest trying to get there ahead of prime lunch, and dinner times. It's a tropical paradise with pirates on stilts, and nautical decor everywhere. From the sea floor, or the boat seats. There's a giant screen that plays video clips and music videos to an array of mostly country songs. And every so often there's a little mini show that really gets the crowd going."}
{"text":"There is no secret I am a parrot head and every town I go to that has a margaritaville I will be going. This place is a great place to visit and the restaurant was setup great. Small fishing boats the seaplane, and of course videos of buffets concerts to enjoy the music. I had the French dip that was so good and the new Jurassic park loaded potato chips. I recommend both to anybody. The house margarita was great like always."}
{"text":"The food was ok a little pricey but over all it was good. Our server on the other hand was rude and the service was lackluster at best. My table tried to engage in small talk with her she completely ignored us. It was not a good experience and it saddens me to think about how excited me and my party were to come here. If I'm perfectly honest the server who brought us our food was 10 times better then Pamela. She was not a good waitress. Please tell your staff about providing a fun and good time atmosphere while at Margaritaville."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! Great place to hang out at. Great atmosphere, food and drinks. My husband and i eat here almost every week. Beth was our server last time and was awesome!"}
{"text":"With so much going on at Westgate it can be hard to choose a place to eat. We have stopped in at Margaritaville a few times to fill our tummies with food before hitting the bars & the drinks start flowing. We came in last Saturday and luckily it wasn't a game night because it can be quite crazy if it is. The food is a little pricy but it's always good. We shared the fried chicken dinner & it was delicious. It came with mashed potatoes and green beans, all of which was great. Our server was SLOW, we were ready to get the rest of the night started but had to wait 20 mins for our waiter to re-appear and then bring us our check. We both commented on how many people could just walk out without paying. Needless to say, the music inside was good, the food was good, and all in all it was another great dinner & an awesome start to our night!"}
{"text":"Okay first things first I've been here multiple times and everytime I go my service is usually pretty good. Now this trip my waiter told one of my family members \"you need to fucking chill\" because the waiter didn't give the change back. I understand that it was a few cents, but you don't assume a customer doesn't want their change back. When I told the waiter that if she continues to talk to my family like that we won't come back in which she replied \"we don't want you here\", I spent over 300 dollars on this meal specifically. Let alone the other times where I spend 250 or more for our dinner and drinks. This bitch of a server will be the reason why you won't be getting my money ever again, after all the times I've been there and the money I've spent that's rediculous. I can't comprehend why she would treat us like this, it's not my fault she's not happy there. Now you just lost my business and my family's business."}
{"text":"Overpriced and nothing special. 
My $15 margarita came in a small cafeteria-style glass with barely any liquor, definitely not enough to get me lit. The $10 beer helped a little. One bite of my $20 burger made me regret even getting food. 
Next time I get the option to go to Margaritaville, I'm choosing AA instead."}
{"text":"Breakfast here was very good. Our waitress was great. We saw people having a couple of drink at 9am but I just needed coffee but overall great place. Drinks are kinda pricey but where can you find a cheap drink on the strip....."}
{"text":"My first time in this place, and I loved it! The bar up top on the third floor is great! 

Overlooking part of the strip with reasonably priced food and drinks??? Really, we are in Vegas? I tend to forget that there is more to Vegas that gigantic nightclubs and casino's. Yes, it's inside the Flamingo, but doesn't feel like it.

I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had family in town, they rode the high roller at the Linq.. Then we headed over to Margaritaville.. I had the watermelon margarita... very bland, more like a slushy, could not taste any alcohol at all.  I suggest folks head over to Bahama Breeze.. This is where you will get the BEST bahama Mama ever....  The taco salad was the worst I have ever eaten.. EVER.. You get 4 very hard & no flavor pita bread type chips.. Needed seasoning or salt.. Anything... The salad was uh um... missing.. not much to it. They put more emphasis on the roast Jalapeno on top than the salad or  chips.  Our family had the Nacho's... I suggest ordering this.. it was huge and looked better than the unappealing taco salad..   Another place I will not be back to eat at... I do have my few must go to's... Bahama breeze.... Toby Keith's Bar & Grill... Hash House ...   The waitress was very nice... The only good thing about this place........"}
{"text":"I've tried to eat here twice.  The first time, at 9:30 PM, there was a huge line and a long, long wait to get in.   Went to the Victorian Room at Bill's instead.

The second time, I arrived at the entrance only to be told by the manager on duty that the restaurant was closing early because \"it was so slow\", and they wouldn't let me in.  What a crock of BS!  Closing early in Vegas????

That was the last chance I am going to give the place, so I'll just have to be satisfied with reading everyone else's reviews."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for lunch this afternoon at Margaritaville. I've frequented the one in Chicago but this was my first time trying the Flamingo location. I ordered the loaded nachos - subbed black beans for the meat off the appetizer list and boy were they loaded! They're definitely an appetizer to share - FYI. Service was fast, though there wasn't much checking in. Vegetarian options are limited so I'd much rather go elsewhere but my visiting friends chose Margaritaville. I would come back to try a margarita or two!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short.  

It was just like what you would expect - overpriced, too many tourists and average food and service.  

If you choose to eat here, it's b/c you probably just arrived and need to eat NOW...and it's across the street from all the major hotels and in a good location.

It's just OK.  Nothing special, unique or all that fun about it.  It's a chain and unless I'm in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, I just cannot get behind this restaurant.  But, it suffices for everything it is meant to do.  Feed you and draw you in b/c it's Jimmy Buffet's restaurant and force you to spend $12 on a burger - done and done.  This is what I have to say to that - blah blah blah - find a buffet. :)"}
{"text":"This is a fun restaurant to visit when in Vegas!    The beach/Caribbean theme is over the top!   The waitstaff is funny.  They had a woman on stilts walking around making great balloon animals.  We ate dinner on the roof top bar.  This section has great views of the strip (Ceasers, part of Ballagio)  We had appetizers and drinks.  They were all good!"}
{"text":"Margaritaville is a must for every Vegas goer! The margaritas are huge and perfectly mixed, and the fajitas are to die for! Servings are huge which is a must in Vegas after all the drinking on the strip. The atmosphere is like a loud luau in the middle of the strip. Patrons sing along with the songs and it's always busy inside. Every stop at the bar I've left with a good story or brought a few friends back to our tables. The food just explodes with flavor and the waitstaff are quick to fill your drinks. There is usually a bit of wait and a line out front and sometimes down the street, but well worth the wait. Just put your name in and wander over to the bar for some great company and good drinks!"}
{"text":"Jimmy Buffett's Margartiaville is always on my to do list when I'm in Vegas and my most recent trip was no different.  My friend and I were partially hungover and I thought the Volcano Nachos would be a good way to start the day.  

On this given Saturday, we didn't have to wait for room at the bar and we immediately sat ourselves at the bar.  The cafe was steadily busy, but not overflowing with customers as you might expect during the late-night hour.  We went ahead and placed our order for the Volcano Nacho and I decided to try a frozen concoction by the name of Havanas and Bananas.  The frozen drink is made with Cruzan Dark Rum, Baileys, and Bols Crema de Banana and Island Oasis coconut mix.

The frozen drink was delicious and tasted like something off the Starbucks Frappachino menu rather than an alcoholic beverage.  The drink was flavorful, yet had a kick of rum that wasn't overpowering in anyway.  The volcano nachos arrived and were just as big as I remembered.  The appetizer can serve as a main entree or can be shared with two or three adults and still have leftovers.  

The volcano nachos are topped with chili, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapeños, tomato and scallions.  Additionally, you can add grilled chicken or beef for an additional charge.  I tend to always go with grilled chicken and yet to try the beef topping.  The nacho plate represents everything Vegas food is about.  The nachos are overwhelming with flavor, spiciness, and size.  The nachos are simply delicious and leave you stuffed.  I can't recommend the nachos enough, especially if you're with a group of friends, as you can all share and dig in.

I would give Margaritaville a full five stars, but I had a horrible experience a few summers ago.  The cafe was busy and I was forced to wait about 25-30 minutes for a spot to open at the bar.  Once I sat myself , I was carded and the girl behind the counter refused to serve me because she said the ID wasn't mine.  Granted, the picture was old and I had gained 100+ lbs, but there was still enough resemblance for me to be served everywhere else in Las Vegas.  Furthermore, she was rude about the whole ordeal and refused to call over a manager.  I was upset and called her a cunt and walked away.  The situation could of been handled better by both parties, but I consider it an isolated incident and sweep it under the rug."}
{"text":"There's good live entertainment and a dance floor and friendly wait staff, which is why the four stars.

The food was disappointing. My jambalaya looked festive but was supremely flavorless. Supremely. My bf's burger was good... Nothing too special."}
{"text":"Stopped by one evening to grab a drink and maybe dinner. We were told it was a 45 min wait for dinner so we scratched that idea. Then we went to the bar to get a drink. We ordered a frozen margarita in a yard glass - extremely expensive and worst frozen drink we've had all week in Vegas. I'd recommend for frozen drinks to go to Fat Tuesday instead."}
{"text":"Drinks are pretty good, just got a regular margarita and it was average. Since it's vegas, it was poured very weak. I got the key West quesadilla and it was a perfect size for lunch, I'd recommend for a quick lunch but not for dinner if you wanna have a good time."}
{"text":"This is a nice place inside the Flamingo Hotel on the strip"}
{"text":"We ordered the volcano nachos. They were ok. All the toppings on top and when you start eating them down you just end up with chips. So we ordered salsa so we can finish the chips."}
{"text":"Volcano Nachos. Get these and you will be happy. I finished it between me and my gf, but it could have easily been shared with 3 or 4. Ridiculous. Margaritas are ok, I got the big Rita I think, and it came with a nice cup to take home. Nice and loud.. rowdy ambiance. I liked it a lot. 

Plus they had pirates, lifeguards, and seamen (oh yeah) walking around on stilts making balloons. We got a shark and flower hat.. pretty weak.. should have gotten the animal or viking hat.

Oh and a tip... the bar is first come first serve seating.. so go and camp out some tables and don't wait in line like the other chumps."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! I can only order 1 drink at a time for 2 people? WTF!!! How long em I in time out for? Don't come here!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'd appreciate this place more if I drank, but I don't know. The food was very average and to be quite honest, overpriced in my opinion for what we got. I get that it's Las Vegas and right on the strip, but to me, I didn't think it was worth the money. We got seated right away and waited quite a bit of time each time the wait service came to our table to order, deliver food, bring checks, etc."}
{"text":"Bartenders here know how to pour!  Order the \"Perfect Margarita\", volcano nachos, and get a seat at the top patio! :)"}
{"text":"The crab and shrimp mac and cheese was vey good, but they skimp on the shrimp and crab in it. Our server Jeff was awesome and recommended a great cocktail! My husband and I visited later for drinks and the 2 male bartenders acknowledged us after 5 minutes and after walking from one end to the bar to the other. When they finally talked to us instead of taking our drink order, they asked us to stand at the other end of the bar where we were originally standing and they would be right with us. They stopped and took orders from 2 other people that came up after us. We will eat here again, but we will never visit the bar here again. There are too many bars on the strip that you can wait less than 10 minutes to get drinks at so don't waste your time waiting around here. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Breakfast food is awesome .... 

Not a huge menu but chicken and waffles are super great 

The big issue here is the staff 

I saw our waitress twice and she delivered on nothing waiting 17 min just to get the bill 

A good manager should be able to make this place awesome, staff should not be in their phones instead of helping paying customers"}
{"text":"After 20-something trips to Vegas and not visiting this super convenient popular strip
Institution, I finally visited margaritaville in my last stay at Caesars...twice!  Once for breakfast and once for dinner.

For breakfast: I decided to go for the 'griddle combo', which was basically every breakfast food you can imagine on your plate, for $15...French toast and regular toast...in the same meal!...anyways it was a ton of carbs, my over medium eggs came out over (very) hard.  I don't think I would come back here for breakfast, but it did hit the spot after a few too many drinks the night before.

For dinner: I ended up getting a burger for dinner and a margarita on the rocks.  This was a much better meal than the breakfast one and considering we were sitting on a patio overlooking the heart of main part of the strip very reasonably priced.  The margarita was definitely the highlight.  Looking back I probably should've tried something a little more adventurous than a burger (jerk chicken? Seafood Mac & cheese?)."}
{"text":"Love this place, amazing atmosphere, and great service. When I tell you I went twice in one trip to get the seafood mac n cheese and the nachos, I felt like a pig in my bathing suit but it was all worth it! A must try"}
{"text":"Margaritaville is a great place to stop by and drink on the strip. It's actually become our favorite place to pregame.. Basically due to our favorite Bar-tender, Tom. The guy makes a perfect 'Perfect Margarita' and makes me and my sibs feel so welcomed. 
Thanks Tom! Heading to the strip now, see you in a few!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know which is a better place, Margaritaville or It's 5ok somewhere. They are like most of Las Vegas overpriced, so you have to put that aside as a complaint! The service here is ok, but the drinks are fantastic! The gift shop, Meh"}
{"text":"This review is based off only one visit which was for a company holiday party in which we had an entire section to ourselves.  The catering for the event was pretty good, and the employees were constantly coming around with trays of food and serving drinks.  The atmosphere I thoguht was perfect for a party.  We were up on the 2nd level, with seating on the balcony overlooking the strip.  They have several heat lamps to keep people warm during the colder winter hours.  I am not a drinker, but from what everyone else was saying, the drinks were good too.  I feel like this was the best company party location we have had in the 6 years I have been with my current employer, so hopefully we come back again."}
{"text":"Food was marginal at best. Service sucked. Performers radiated self-loathing. The staff made no mention of the fact that our table (including food and beverages) would be showered with stripper pool water when a bikini clad dirty woman slid down a water slide from above the dining room into a giant blender that resembled a carnival dunk tank. She then surfaced and flung more water onto us and our food. Completely disgusting. They could have told us that our table would be part of the water show or at least not served our food until after the splashing was finished. Who wants their dinner served with pool water? Waiter came by after the 'show' to check on us. I told him it was really not okay that our dinner was now a la swimming pool and he did NOTHING. We didn't ask for a manager, but one came by and asked if we had. We said no, but told him that his staff should give people a heads up before seating folks in that area. He said they should have told us and offered to discount our check. He took $4 off! What a crock of chit! Despite being musically themed, the acoustics are horrible. The music ranges from annoyingly loud to mega loud and distorted. This place sucks in every way possible."}
{"text":"Huge place. Hostess wasn't overly friendly. We got right in and got a table. Server was great we started with volcano nachos which are enormous! That is a meal within itself and very good. House margarita was good. We did catch the show they do with the chick going down the slide into a blender. Pretty cool."}
{"text":"I was in need for a margarita and I thought this would be the perfect place to get one.  I chose to come in this time of year because I knew we wouldn't have to wait to get service.  We walked in,went to the bar and was greeted with no wait.  We ordered two margaritas and that's when the two start rating came in.  I ordered a frozen margarita and it came out of a machine!  I thought for sure I would hear that lovely ice crushing/blender noise, but nooooo.  My friend ordered one on the rocks and it was it was two pours,  probably margarita mix and a puree.  I understand in the busy summertime, making traditional margaritas would be a nightmare, but this was a shame.  Mine tasted fine, but then again,  I haven't met a fruit smoothie I didn't like."}
{"text":"so because Danielle did such a great job last time with the frozen margaritas that i had to go again on this trip. she was still there & provided excellent service & drinks again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop on the strip in Vegas. If you are a Parrothead this is the place for you. The atmosphere is amazing, there is even a seaplane hanging from the ceiling.

Excellent margaritas, and great food. I will certainly return to Margaritaville the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food seems pretty overpriced but I guess that's what is to be expected from a gimmicky place on the strip. 

Went to eat there during game 7 of cav and war game. Less than a minute left of the game and they decided that was the time to start their show in the restaurant which consists of them turning off the game on the big screens and showing an old school concert and having three people dance around on stilts. I would have rather seen the last minute of the biggest basketball game of the year. The show would have been nice to see at any other time during our meal than the last minute of the game. The whole hour we were there they only decided to dance when we didn't want to see it. Super bummed. 

Only saw our waitress at the beginning when she got our drink orders and food. Never came to check on us and was Mia when we wanted our check. 

I ordered a sandwich with an additional salad and sweet potato fries. I assumed they were going to serve me the salad first and then bring out my sandwich with the fries but that's not how it happened. The sandwich came on the same plate as the salad and I literally got a side of fries. Ok  whatever I guess I will have to be more specific next time if there is a next time."}
{"text":"This place is just cheesy enough!!!  

We typically just eat and drink at the bar because that is where all of the fun is!!!  The bartenders during the day are funny and nice.  The patrons are all just out to have fun and you meet the nicest and oddest people here!!!  The food is not amazing here, but I don't think most people are coming to Vegas for the food!!!  The drinks, however, are delicious!!!

We did eat at the restaurant part this past weekend for a family dinner and it just was not the same.  The service was slow and not as peppy.  We will definitely return to Margaritaville, but will definitely opt for the bar to enjoy our drinks and food!!!"}
{"text":"The staff ruined what would have been an enjoyable experience. 5:00 on a Monday and not busy, so no excuse. Hostess was unpleasant and did not want to be bothered to turn in her chair to face us. It was as if we were asking a favor to be sat - shouldn't she be greeting and asking us??!! The bartender/server didn't know what she was doing - drink was wrong, salad dressing was wrong, one entree was wrong, didn't bother to refill water. THEN a busser comes over with a tub and starts taking things from the table (my boyfriend was in the bathroom, but we were still eating!). I get him to go away by asking for a box, which he comes back with and then quickly starts taking everything else away! SOOOO WEIRD. It happened so fast and we were sitting so near the loud band (who were great), I couldn't stop him. Never had anything like that happen before anywhere. It's not opening week anymore guys - you're going to have to try harder or replace some of the staff."}
{"text":"Horrible service other than the bar. Got accused of seating myself after being seated by a hostess. Will never come back again. Not worth the big $$$$ to eat and drink. Wouldn't serve us period."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast.  There was a long wait to be seated so we ate at the bar.  The food was really good and the bartender provided excellent service."}
{"text":"Fun was good.
Entertainment while you dine and drink.
Balloon animals and musical show to boot.
Small wait for a table."}
{"text":"Had the best experience here. Not only were the nachos killer, atmosphere great, our server Ryan went above and beyond to make sure our experience here was great along with suggestions to where to visit while in Vegas since it was me and my friends first time visiting. Thanks Ryan!"}
{"text":"Still awesome! The daytime band was amazing and we had a great time! The nachos again were too much food and so so good! I can't wait to try and get back here every weekend! We love the food, beer, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went back for a second visit will not be returning. Food was mediocre drinks were terrible. Been to the Las Vegas location more times than I can count and never had an issue.Not sure what issue is here but I can't see them lasting in this location."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken wings are pretty great. The buffalo wings I could pass on.

I got the French Onion burger, which was good but a bit too salty and onion-y... surprise surprise. It tasted like it was seasoned with a pack of onion soup mix.

Boyfriend got the Hawaiian burger which he really enjoyed. I liked picking the little bits of mango off his plate.

Fries were good enough and the margaritas were a bit weak but tasted good.

Staff was all super nice including our waitress who was happy to recommend all kind of things for us and the girls by the door who offered to take a picture of us with the token big breasted mermaid."}
{"text":"Yup, this place is good.  Great wait staff and great food.  Just go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and had a good time. We had the loaded nachos which is a ridiculous amount of food, and then just shared a burger. The food wasn't the best I've ever had but was good. 

We waited about 20 minutes for a table for two around 1pm which wasn't too bad. The service was okay and the prices were decent as well. We sent about $40 on the nachos, cheeseburger and two soft drinks with tip."}
{"text":"Ask for JJ, he's the best. He does the best tricks, makes you feel like family, and keeps you entertained. He's is by far one of the best bartenders I have met in Las Vegas and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"If your looking for a cool ambiance, a break from the tables/machines, don't have much patience for long lines at clubs/bars, just want to grab a bite and a drink, listen to live music or maybe even bust some moves on the dance floor.. then you may want to keep this place in mind. This place lies in the middle of the mega hotel/casinos on Las Vegas Blvd, its multi-leveled, upper floor open dining area (great view of the casinos, people and action along the strip), features live bands, alcohol and decent food! 

Volcano Nachos: includes chili cheese, guac, sour cream, ooey gooey cheeses, jalapenos, tomatoes and scallions.. Optional grilled chicken and fajita steak. opt for the griled chicken and fajita steak (we half chicken and steak). Its a massive amount of one of the ultimate starter nachos I've had! Great to munch on while sippin' on a drink and it should satisfy at least 4 people!

Jimmy's Jammin' Jamabalaya: Cajun rice, shrimp, chicken, and andouille sausage \"simmered in a spicy broth\".. Does that sound good or what! I've only had a few versions of Jambalaya and never been disappointed. Their version more than satisfied! The rice absorbed the broth and married its flavors into all the meats making every bite, flavored packed! Not only super tasty, portion could be split with another person. 

Servers/Bartenders were always giddy and helpful. Value of dining was good and most of all the location is hard to top!"}
{"text":"This place is ahhright, in my opinion. It's koo if you are with a group of friends who enjoy downing margaritas, than the margarita boat is the way to go. My girls and I headed here at the start of our night, mind you we showed up tipsy (it's vegas, I refuse to act my age! =) ) anywho, we got a margarita boat, downed it, ended up becoming part of the drunken idiots on the balcony for a quick second and then rolled out......individual drinks aren't worth it, you are better off sitting at a penny machine and getting the free cocktails lol. But most def koo on the boat."}
{"text":"Fast and easy location to get to since I was staying at The Linq. Food was ok but my drink was really good. I forget which margarita I had but the guy sure made it strong which was ok with me."}
{"text":"Loud and obnoxious, just like you'd expect it to be.  The girl sliding down the volcano is unnecessary.  

However, the food is surprisingly delicious.  I expected gimmicky garbage food but was pleasantly surprised by the Ahi Tuna Tostada.  It was excellent.  The Cuban sandwich was good.  The Fish Sandwich is good.

In summary, food good atmosphere bad."}
{"text":"We came here one night after dinner for the sole reason of getting more buzzed/drunk. It was a pretty chill atmosphere: dark, with music, and some space for dancing.

They have a huge variety of drinks (with a full bar), mostly centered around margaritas; it is, afterall, in their name. If you want their strongest drink, get the Perfect Margarita (gold tequila, silver tequila, triple sec, orange curacao and lime juice on the rocks. I can't say it tasted very good because, well, it didn't; but it did its job.

I may have been drunk after an additional shot of grey goose, but I'm calling BS on this extra tax they charged us. The sales tax in Vegas is 8.1%, but they charged us 18.1%. I knew something wasn't right when the tax they charged was higher than the amount listed next to the suggested 15% tip amount. When I asked our server about it, he said all places in Vegas charge an extra 10% tax at places where they have entertainment. That's the first time I've ever heard about something like that. What BS! I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is okay, the decor is kind of tacky but seriously go for happy hour! Great drinks, great appy's, great service. The 5 o'clock somewhere will go down so easy and for $5 a drink you will probably have too any and have too much Vegas fun afterwards."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and cleanliness. The staff is friendly and quick to turn-over tables to keep the wait down. We started at the bar and ordered the Lost Mango in Paris and the Perfect Margarita. The mango drink was named appropriately, given there is absolutely no mango flavor in it. The Perfect Margarita leaves much to be desired, the least of which being the volume of drink for the price. The food? Ordered the calamari and lava lava shrimp. The aioli with the shrimp would better be served with the calamari. I have no idea where the lava lava name in the shrimp dish came from. The spicy homemade marinara is more like a tomato soup with too much pepper, no marinara flavor at all. I get it, these places are probably meant to draw in the tourist crowds that will experience this marginal fare and drink and probably never come back, but being from CLE and loving our city, we want to give to the revitalization. Saying that- we'll come back after the place gets through it first year. So far, not living up to the hype, rather fulfilling the expectation."}
{"text":"I'll be honest.  Margaritaville was my not first choice.  It was pre-concert and we had naively intended to dine at Yard House but upon hearing it was AN HOUR AND A HALF wait, we opted to eat here.  While we waited for a table, we got margaritas at the bar.  I opted for a mango margarita....  and I think they cheat.  I think they have a \"main\" frozen margarita mix and then they just add whatever flavor you choose.  While my margarita did have chunks of mango in it, it had an odd chemical taste that I was not digging.  My companion enjoyed hers though (and tasted mine to make sure they were the same) so maybe it's just me.  

We ordered the Volcano Nachos or Nachos Volcano or The Incredible Stack of Goodness.  Because it was.  It was delicious and the two of us barely put in a dent in it.  

Service was sketchy.  It was good initially but we sat for quite a while waiting for check.  Normally, I wouldn't be too concerned about that but we had show tickets and one does not keep Justin Timberlake waiting."}
{"text":"The 5 'O clock Somehwere Bar inside Margaritaville is hands down THE best place to drink on the strip during the hours of 5-7pm every. single. day. You'll be hard pressed to find deals this good. They have $1 vodka shots, $5 classic margaritas, and some chick is walking around with $3 Jello shots! I've gone with friends twice and everyone always has a great time. The atmosphere is perfect too-- it's fun, loud, but also has a sense of being a little more laid back than the strip. The bartenders are hilarious, talented (they do tricks!) but extremely attentive and make sure you're never left trying to wave them down. It's like a vacation within vacation. The actual casino part of Margaritaville is also really neat. It's less crowded than the main floor and again, just a very chill vibe. There's also beer pong which makes for a fun activity to get the night started. Just to clarify: this happy hour is restricted to the bar that's RIGHT off the gambling floor, not inside of the restaurant. Also to note: they don't serve food at this bar, but they do at the one inside the restaurant. So typically we'll drink during happy hour, then move inside for some Volcano Nachos (amazing, meatless, but big enough to share with 2-4 HUNGRY people!)"}
{"text":"This place needs A LOT of work!  For starters, we walked in past the patio so we saw that there were 4 or 5 tables open so we were happy we would get to sit outside.  When we walked in it took a long time to be acknowledged so I finally went up and asked if we could sit on the patio... the girl at the counter was scratching her head and said the patio was full..  so we went to the bar and I saw the 4 tables still open.. granted they were dirty still but we wanted a patio table.  So I went back to the hostess and told her there were 4 tables open and she said \"oh OK\"..  wow really??  So that was our initial experience... the rest of the night didn't go much better... drinks took FOREVER to get to our table.. and the place was not busy at all!!  The server forgot to bring our salad... the food is way expensive, ribs EH... nothing special.. then it took a very long time for the server to bring our check.  Just wasn't a feel good enjoyable experience.  Won't be back... too many other good choices in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Ugh. I went here with a group of 8 people after a day full of traveling on planes. We arrived shortly after 10:30pm and the live band was just starting up. It was smoky and loud and I'm pretty sure our waiter could barely hear us, so I'll forgive the orders that he messed up (including forgetting to bring drinks out to the table). However, that does not excuse the very slow service and the fact that when our food finally did arrive, it looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes or so. My burger was so soggy I had to eat it with a fork."}
{"text":"good food, great prices, perfect casual spot along the strip!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the lack of ANY real gluten free choices is more than inconvenient -- it is a deal breaker.  I can eat salad at Wendy's.   The Perfect Margaritas remain perfect.   Don't go looking for anything that used to be signature with Margaritaville -- no Caribbean flare at all on this menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. Hostesses are really sweet, servers are fast and attentive, and the food is good! Its always nice to have a manager check in and ask how the meal was as well. Yes it is loud, what do you expect? Loudness is part of the fun! I'd say this place is good for everyone , balloon animals for the kids, yummy alcoholic choices for the adults. The volcano nachos are a must."}
{"text":"Bar was fun but the food sucked!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I are regulars in Vegas! Currently sitting at Margaritaville at the land shark lookout! Sitting upstairs! Now, we are from San Diego & understand tourism! Renee was our server! And she is the Boss B!! Bomb.com. Didn't treat us like tourists, but like awesome regulars!! We love Rene!! We love Margaritaville! And we will be back fo'sho!! Ask for Rene! With one E! Rene! Rene! Rene!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the restaurant.  Cute place, decorations reminded me of being in Key West Florida. It is extremely loud so don't plan on having any kind of conversation  unless you want a sore throat from screaming.  We came during the week, so we really got seated pretty quickly. Then it began!

Our waitress was pleasant enough, but they seemed very understaffed. We ordered Calamari, it was cold  and definitely not the even that good.  Then we ordered our food.  We have been waiting well over an hour and 45 min., and still no food in sight. Also I ordered a salad, and asked if the chicken could be changed for shrimp. I could but for a $ 6.00 upcharge. Seemed a bit steep seeing how the salad was already $14.95. I choose not to get it.
We then decided to ask for the manager. He came right over, and was very willing to fix the situation.  He said someting about our orders got mixed up.  Whatever!! It was nice , but a little to late!
I definitely will not cone back. Won't stay in business long if  they can't get it together. I can't even imagine what it's like on the weekends!  Haven't even given a review on the dinner yet.... we are still waiting for that!"}
{"text":"For the meal that we received last night I would say it is good, but what made it the best was the quality of service and the atmosphere. I will try other dishes and revise me review afterward. My son insisted that we eat at Margaritaville last night because he loves the smell of the food when we passed by.  

I must say the photographer at Margaritaville took one of our best we've had taken. Anytime we go on the High Roller for example the picture is horrible. It will cost you between $10 and $30 for the picture, which is not put on the bill.  Of course the free souvenir picture is acceptable except the pictures so tiny."}
{"text":"My husband has been wanting to come to this place because the last time he was here, all he could talk about was the blackened Mahi Mahi and how good it is.  So we finally came here last month for my birthday and he was a little disappointed.  It surely did not taste the same as the last time.  I had the full rack of ribs and that was not so bad.  They have great entertainment and people walking in stilts singing.  They also have this lady that slides down into a huge margarita/wine glass.  Overall, this restaurant is fun but I'll probably end up going somewhere that is not along the strip.  It's definitely crowded so expect to wait for a table."}
{"text":"came here today to watch the game and had an awesome time. great vibe, cool people, excellent staff. the managers Kevin and Vickie both stopped by to check on us and were so awesome. they obviously did their best to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. we'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a casual meal on the strip - -two outside levels that overlook the strip plus the indoor eating area also-- your choice! 
Good show inside at dinnertime also.  Dancer who goes down the volcano and into a blender!  I have eaten off the menu and all  is good!  Get the conch fritter appitizer !"}
{"text":"Really great margaritas, especially the \"Perfect Margarita\" my waiter tried to talk me out of getting it because it was too \"strong\". Well, it's not and in fact it will give you the best buzz ever.
I love the volcano nachos, super awesome and big. It's basically like a meal, and the burger was pretty good too.
Service was slow, and our waiter was a doushe, but I really liked it.
Keep an eye out for the volcano blowing! (apparently a mermaid is supposed to come out of the volcano, but that didn't happen during my visit there)"}
{"text":"Margaritaville is always a must when you are in Vegas! I love that it's right in the middle of the strip. Not only do they have the yummy frozen drinks but they also have a full bar inside if you're not a frozen drink type of person. I was staying at the Linq hotel and I love that this was located right when I walked outside of the hotel. If you are near by I highly recommend to go in and get a refreshing drink before continuing to walk the blazing hot Las Vegas strip!"}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour. Margarita 2 for 1. The bartender was on point with his pours. After being in the pool all afternoon, one cannot go wrong by sitting here and let the liquor flow. Great service, but the decor can use some update."}
{"text":"Just trying to find an alternative to the incredibly overpriced restaurants on the strip was a challenge.  We tried Margaritaville but the menu was really limited and still over-priced.  I ended up with the fish tacos which was probably one of the best values on the menu.  For around $17 I got two small pieces of tasty and tender battered white fish in two soft tacos with a large portion of black beans and rice.  The coleslaw they mention on he menu is a small spoonful placed on the fish in the taco.  Not enough to get you full but the rice and beans will help.  I asked for butter and it was flavored and helped with the bland beans and rice.  My son got a burger which was off the kids menu.  We opted to skip a third meal or desert.  We ended up paying around $26 plus tip.  The had a girl slide down a huge display into a gigantic champagne glass and flaunt around in it for a few minutes.  All the guys loved that as she had a rockin' body.  They had a gigantic Margaritas that 4-6 people could share so if you want to get your drink on, this could be fun."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday got sat right away, but had to wait 25 minutes for no server to even come to the table or acknowledge our presence. I walked up to the host desk and asked if there was a server working this section he said yes and brought us over some water... waited ten more minutes for no server still. So in all we waited 35 minutes for zero service, we ended up leaving and eating at coastal taco instead which had amazing service and food. I don't think I'm going to try margaritaville again and I was so excited to eat here..."}
{"text":"I'm not a parrothead by any means, but Margaritaville wasn't all that bad.  It smelled no worse than Caesar's Palace or anywhere else on the outside of Vegas (I kept smelling raw sewage everywhere....ewwwww) and I could smell inside Margaritaville was food.  It was a great place to go with my coworkers because a) you didn't need to dress up post-tradeshow, b) we got funky balloon hats to help lighten somber moods, and c) it was quick, the food was pretty damn decent, and there was alcohol involved.  While I prefer my neighbourhood 'rita the best (Maiz, Chicago), Margaritaville does a decent job."}
{"text":"OK so it has been a while since I have been in a bar but the two I visited on my trip were terrible.  This was bad service coupled with astronomically high prices.  I waited forever for service and ordered a margarita. Its an ICEE with booze in it and for that I was charged $35.  Oh sure I got to keep the plastic blender like keepsake but really $35.00!

I was here a couple years ago and remember a whole different experience with the food beverage and service.  This was extremely disappointing and way over priced even for a parrot head."}
{"text":"I was expecting cheesy, but not just lousy. The drinks were good, but the food was not good. We had a group of 11 for my mother in laws birthday. Five of us were served 10-15 minutes before the other six. I ordered a burger , wait I ordered the \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" , this was a signature item on the menu. It was a frozen patty cooked lousy and served with bad lettuce and toppings the fries were also not good. This was consistent with the other food orders and everyone was pretty disappointed. So much is put into the atmosphere and bar, However, the food is a pricier and more mediocer than Applebees quality."}
{"text":"I enjoy Jimmy Buffett's music. It always puts me in a good mood and makes me wish I was on vacation. So, since I was on vacation and in a good mood, I figure what better way to embrace that Buffett feeling than to give Margaritaville a try. Never having been here, I went in with relatively high hopes... at least for a good margarita. 

Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. I had the pomegranate margarita -- on the rocks -- and it was really nothing special. For $7.75, I expected much more drink with much more alcohol. And, then there was the food. Honestly, I've had better fare at Chili's or TGI Fridays. I had the lunch special of 1/2 a Cuban sandwich and house salad.  When our food came out, I looked at my sandwich, and thought, \"Is this it?\" It was one heck of a tiny 1/2 sandwich. And, the salad -- well, it reminded me of a hospital cafeteria's pre-made salad -- dry lettuce, uber-dry flakes of carrots and some bite-size pieces of re-hydrated cucumbers. Plus, the amount of dressing the gave me just barely made eating the salad bearable. 

The \"atmosphere\" was okay. I expected it to be beachy and laid-back, but it was a bit too kitschy for me.  It reminded me of a place you'd visit at a theme park. But, hey, maybe that is Buffet's dream... create a theme park called Buffetland, where people can fish for parrots while drinking margaritas.

My final complaint is the service. It was descent at first. The waitress was nice enough and attentive enough. However, when we were ready for our check, it took forrrrrever for her to bring it to us.  She had told us as she took our plates that she'd be right back with the check.  Well, as I watched her go to another table, then to the register (thinking she was processing our bill), then into the kitchen, back to the other table, then back to the register (thinking she was processing our bill THIS time), then to another table, she finally came past ours. Before she could rush away, I loudly said we needed the check because we were in a hurry. She nodded and FINALLY got us our check. 

I'll give the waitress the benefit of the doubt, and chalk it up to a perfect storm of me being anxious about being late for an appointment and annoyed that she was taking so long, and her having bad timing or being busy.  

Nevertheless, that wasn't the only disappointment I had with Margaritaville.  The food was blah, the prices were too high for the low quality food, and the atmosphere and decor of the place was rather cheesy.  Unfortunately, THAT imperfect storm of qualities makes it likely that I won't be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I am a Vegas local and I had some girlfriends in town for a Bachelorette Party. We waited 40 minutes for our table and once we sat down we were shoved in the back corner where we were unable to enjoy the live band and environment. As people walked through the aisle of our table area, I was repeatedly \"bumped\" which was very annoying throughout the dinner. We ordered a tower of margarita which tasted like sweet and sour infused with salt. They provided us one shot of extra tequila to share and add to our individual margaritas but the drink was still horrible!!!! Out of 9 women, no one drank more than a few sips of their drink which was a complete waste of $65! We waited a little over an hour for our meals and service was slow! Dinners were mediocre as the burgers had a half a head of iceberg lettuce on top which made it difficult to eat. The turkey club was soggy, drenched in mayonnaise & fries were warm and wilted!

At the end of the meal, my friend argued with the manager for 20 mins and they finally discounted the bill by a small margin! None of us cared for the rude remarks! We all work in professional careers where customer service is number one and that was not the case here! 

We will not be returning to this place!"}
{"text":"JARED JARED JARED! The food is great and the whole experience will be even better if JARED is serving you!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant out as it's a chain restaurant and went to a couple before. Tried the Volcano Nachos which was rated as a must have.  Didn't disappoint...huge mound of chips, chili, salsa, guacamole, jalapenos and the only complaint was the lower chips went soggy too fast.

Very reasonably priced and large food portions.

The bucket o beers were a decent deal, knocked a few bucks off the total for 5 beers.  

Boating theme inside with large screens playing Buffet videos.

The place got packed at lunch time and a lot of people were having the nachos too.

Recommended but bring an appetite."}
{"text":"Best burger in vegas, black and blue cheeseburger. Nuff said"}
{"text":"SLOW SERVICE!  On a WED.  Food:  Fresh fish salty!  The food is the worst food of any I have ordered!  Do not waste your time or money. You AZ people have many wonderful places. This places should close. It is tha bad!"}
{"text":"Food is always great (volcano nachos) and the DJ on Friday night is AMAZING!! Loving the music."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's a burger in paradise,  but it was good.  I like that they ask how you want your burger cooked (rare,  well done,  etc).   It was a good burger and service was average.   It's around $20 for burger and coke, but hey you're on the Strip in Vegas baby!"}
{"text":"Wasted $10 parking just to get told it's a 2 1/2 hr wait on a Tuesday evening with half the tables empty."}
{"text":"I love this bar! the food here is good and the drinks are great! this is a great place for day time drinks in the heat. It just has a great vibe that really makes you wanna get your drink on!"}
{"text":"Alright service, but tasty snacks can't make review on meals as I didn't have one but ordered beach tacos and a bucket of beer with my wife and waitress was changing shifts and I understand that but you don't have to be rude about it."}
{"text":"I get it. Judge away. Yes, I was in Vegas and ate at Margaritaville - out of all the thousands of other restos. But the bride-to-be was in charge and wanted 'ritas and queso. 

I'd actually never been to Margaritaville. I will say that the \"Perfect Margarita\" was good - strong, pure lime juice, agave and semi-guilt free. The queso had nothing on real Texas queso, but the salsa was good. Other menu items weren't too intriguing - they have fish tacos but your only option is beer-battered. I settled on the grilled chicken which was pretty plain Jane. 

I will say the best part of the experience - other than the 'ritas and odd people-watching - was our service from Ryan L. He brought out the drinks fast - even one on the house as he noticed our bride was crying tears of joy - and even split our checks without our party even requesting that. (And that's the only restaurant in Vegas that did it. Not even the top-dollar restos would accommodate.)"}
{"text":"Very touristy. 8ft guys handing out balloon animals-a little creepy to me, but hey what happens in Vegas right?  Every time the 10ft screen starts showing Jimmy Buffet start to play a bleach blond comes out in a beachy getup and starts to...hula/margaritaville polka dance. Work with me here I'm trying my best to give you the full ambiance of what you get for your $ here. Did NOT care for the premixed margaritas but their bartenders do know their way around a bar if you ask them to make one of your favorites."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic! It was our birthday so he hooked us up with free ice cream sundaes and was very friendly. We had the chicken wings which were pretty good size and I'm still craving them. We also split a cheeseburger in paradise. This is suppose to be their signature burger but I didn't really care for it.too messy, flavor was boring and it was just a regular burger.nothing special about it.all in all, it was a good experience...primarily because of the service."}
{"text":"This place is loud but the service was excellent and the fish tacos were really good. Of course the margaritas were all delicious as well. The menu was simpler than expected.  The wait time was shorter than promised and we sat down almost immediately. The entertainers on stilts kept all the families happy with their balloon hats. Fun and touristy."}
{"text":"Fun place for what it is.  I'm not a Jimmy Buffet fan, but I don't hate him.  Had to try a margarita though, and it was good.  My friend who was in from Georgia really wanted to go and we were hungry with no clue what to eat (didn't want buffet) so we tried it.  Food was ok, my soup was lukewarm."}
{"text":"The margaritas sure do pack a punch! That's what you want - right? It sure is nice to have a frozen drink in the Vegas heat at Margaritaville. The outdoor patio with water misters and umbrellas is a nice place to hang out and watch the craziness of The Strip pass you by.

Also enjoyable is the inside Tiki bar with lots of sitting room and plenty of games close at hand. The theme of this joint is perfect for Vegas. May as well stop in and have a marg just to say you did.

I was a bit put off by the fact that I had to wander through the Flamingo to find the rest rooms but it was a good walk which burned off some of the booze. It's not inexpensive for a marg but it's well worth the money.

The gambling seemed decent but I was more in the mood to hang out here on my last visit. It's a great place to kill time with some strong drinks. Not once did I hear Jimmy Buffet which was a gift and a disappointment. Next time...maybe."}
{"text":"A great dining experience all the way around.  Now I did go for lunch on a Saturday vs. try to brave a late-night crowd when there was a performance; all the previous reviews that expressed concerns about food and service were sooo unfounded.  I love the hull-like table I was seated at in the true beach theme...really neat.

Had the beer-steamed shrimp, caesars salad, and cheeseburger in paradise.  All just totally hit the spot (the shrimp because it was unique for Vegas, i.e. not on buffet and steamed with beer and old bay spice...the salad because it was gigantic for a small salad and you tend to forgot the \"good\" food when in Vegas...and the burger, because well, that \"is\" Buffett's and it was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time).

Beyond that the vibe was very upbeat, Buffett-like for sure.  My server was repeatedly refilling my soft drink and water, was very cordial (I was dining alone and using a Groupon), and the food came out quite prompt.  In general, the vibe of the other employees was great -- ie when folks are smiling, their non-verbal body language reflects that they're having fun...well that means a very positive dining experience for us customers."}
{"text":"Not worth any of your money. 
If you're looking for a FANTASTIC margarita, head to Hussongs (best margarita in Vegas- and great prices). This is a really loud, touristy, overpriced place to come. The hostess was standoff-ish, but the server was very sweet! She was also attentive. That was the only thing that made the visit ok. The rest of it (food, drinks, atmosphere) was all pretty bad. Save your time and money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Ok food. Not a great happy hour. No one is here for dinner. Cool if you are a huge jimmy fan not so cool otherwise. Not a must visit. If are bored check it out."}
{"text":"Hostess gave our table away -- the buzzer beeped we cashed out and went to get our table and she said sorry I gave your table away...this time we sat in the lobby.  Server was very friendly, food was good, but the short stocky Security Guard takes his job way too seriously to the point he is a buzzkill when nothing is happening...We had a bird's eye view as our tables were in the front facing the stage,  and watched as he was just gunning for someone to do something that would require his expertise.  Way too much, and the people sitting next to us felt the same way!!  I wanted to suggest that he take it down a few notches, but opted to just let it go.  He certainly is not a company asset.  We were there to chill, relax, listen  to music and have a great time but it was hard when Rambo walks by every moment like a stalker just waiting for prey.  Went to Hard Rock, had a great time!"}
{"text":"1. nachos were AMAZING!!! and you definitely can share them
2. margaritas were AMAZING!!!! they had my god mama and my mama feeling gooooood
3. they have MIST which definitely helps in 100 degree weather
4. waitress was AMAZING....and cute lol

We go every year EVEN if its not a happy hour or whatever bc the prices arent bad but I DO RECOMMEND RESERVATIONS if possible bc that place is always packed"}
{"text":"It's a cheap place (compared to other establishments in Vegas) to take a time out from whatever it is that we do in Vegas.  Head upstairs, there is a first come first serve dinning deck upstairs and even the occasional live music.  It's touristy, chessy, but what isn't chessy and touristy on the strip in Vegas??

After food and drinks for the 6 of us, it came out to around $150 per with tip.  We took a shot or two... or three.

But hey, that is like a round of blackjack at the tables."}
{"text":"Hostess ignored us then told us we could sit upstairs... We went upstairs to find out that they just did last call and we can't even get served here... Disappointed because I love the song that this place is named after and would've loved to have been a patron... Oh well I guess we'll hit somewhere else on the strip."}
{"text":"Teriyaki steak was great!  Lots of Margaritas to choose from.  Our meal took a long time so our waiter bought us a coupla extra margaritas.  

People on stilts walk around and will blow up balloons and place them on your head.  Fun time."}
{"text":"Try the Volcano Nachos, no really, they're the second best nachos in town. The perfect Margaritas are some of the best Margaritas in town. You'll pay for it but hey it's good 'ol Vegas Strip fun. 

Sure Margaritaville is cheesy, but so what!! It feels good to be cheesy now and then. This can be said about a lot of Strip places and this and Toby Keith's at Harrah's are perfect examples. Just because you live in a tourist town doesn't mean you can't go to tourist places. For God's sake, we assume people that live in Hawaii go to the beach. So we're going to the strip and places like this and we're having as much fun as everyone else."}
{"text":"Happy hour deal is good and lasts until 7 and starts again at 10. Quality is mediocre, but good for half price."}
{"text":"Horrible guest services hostesses.  Walked in for happy hour and never been here before.  Asked how the space was laid out since there are multiple entrances, with no clear paths from the main entrance.  Elderly hostess game me a what the fuck look, openly sneered at us, and turned to the next guests while putting us off to the side. I asked the 2nd hostess how to get to the bar, and if the restaurant was open.  She was more patient but still curt.... & explained how the restaurant doesn't open til 5pm.  Then they have 2 bars downstairs and 1 upstairs.  So in a city where service is \"the economy\" and it could've been a great experience.  This place is an epic fail.  Jimmy, you could benefit in training this crew to be more welcoming and better brand ambassadors.  So we left.  Take it coming from a Head of HR."}
{"text":"Had a horrible customer service experience at the beginning of my vacation! Not how I wanted to start my vacation off. We were offered a coupon in the lobby for if we \"spend $20 on food & bev receive a free margarita\", so we decided to get some drinks before checking into our rooms. Dani was our bartender and we ordered 2 drinks totaling $21.50 before taxes to get the free drink. She said we had to spend more than that and she talked to me as if I was stupid after I asked a question regarding the coupon then she went on to say 'I'm not going to argue with you' with the worst attitude after I asked her to the explain it again because our total was $21.50. I expected more and better customer service from this place that has so many good reviews, kinda bummed. Definitely not going back! You should hire people with better customer service, especially working on the strip at a named bar that gets so many tourists. She gave your business a bad name."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great giving us suggestions on the best things to order- which were the burgers and the house margarita.  My husband tried the burger and it was very good.  The Margaritas were also very good.  I ordered the taco salad and it was OK but nothing special. Next time I will have a burger.
."}
{"text":"Drinks are much too expensive, paid $6 for a Heineken when I paid $1 for a Michelob 10 minutes before. Or waiter gave us great service he was very attentive and checked on our table often. Nachos , which could feed 4 normal people for about $16 were a good deal, because of the huge portion. We got steak and chicken nachos and 3 of us could not finish them, and they were good. The nachos had chunks of chicken, steak, ground beef, nacho cheese, shredded cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. Get the nachos and order nothing else, save your money on drinks and buy them some where else or flask it."}
{"text":"Love this place! GREAT food and GREAT drinks! Can't go wrong here! Try the tacos and of course the margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"Was just in Vegas again last month & I figured I'd write a review since they changed the menu recently. New menu is a little smaller, and isn't exactly as pescatarian/ vegetarian friendly as it used to be. They took off some of the pasta dishes and mushroom burger. I mostly come here for the drink and atmosphere so I made do. I ordered the caesar salad with no chicken, which was pretty good! Good dressing and the top it with fried onions - yum! It adds a nice texture to an otherwise boring dish. I do eat fish, so I also ordered a crab cake and the fish tacos at a different meal. The crab cakes were alright, but being from New England, they just don't compare. But, I would order them again if I were in the mood for one. The fish tacos were great, although I wish they offered the option of grilled fish instead of deep fried as I'm not a big fan of fried food, but they were still really good and I'd definitely order them on our next trip! 

They have expanded the seating and now have open air seating overlooking the Quad. I prefer to sit upstairs, but it's a nice alternative when the upstairs desk is closed. 

I highly recommend the 5 O'Clock Somewhere and the Perfect Margarita (the perfect margarita is loaded with alcohol though...in the desert heat I became dehydrated and lightheaded very quickly after drinking a couple of these in the span of a few hours.....be sure to ask for a water with it!)

They used to do a pretty good breakfast, but it looks like they aren't doing it anymore (?) Too bad - we definitely would have gone! 

Definitely a place to stop at least once on your Vegas trip, even if just for a drink and the atmosphere. If you go at night, they have live music. It's really loud, so don't plan on having a conversation with your group, but it's great if you want to go dance without going to a club."}
{"text":"Having just arrived in Vegas and meeting up with some business partners, we decided on a centrally located restaurant on the strip to grab a drink and bite.  What better place than the highly visually patio of Margaritaville!   The margaritas didn't disappoint.  They were made by a heavy hand, and we shared a big appetizer plate of nachos.   

Fun Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville atmosphere and decor, with the music to-boot.  Not a bad place to enjoy a drink with your friends."}
{"text":"I've been to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville elsewhere like in Grand Cayman and Cozumel and sadly this is the ugly cousin twice removed that exists only by name but not actuality. 

went here on a friday night and was surprised to be wristbanded as tho it was a club but it wasn't. they had a tired dj and it was dimly lit. well my friends and I got ourselves a table coz our intention of goin to Margaritaville was to have dinner, after the Chocolate Affaire. 

The menu was nothing special and really ordinary and prior to my visit to the awful excuse as a Margaritaville franchise the only things i've had are the margaritas and nachos. Anywho, ordered a bbq bacon cheeseburger asked it to be cooked medium, my friends ordered the chicken volcano nachos. The burger was alright, it wasn't that great and it was cooked well so a star was subtracted at first bite, the bun was a typical fast food burger bun, so another star, and the chicken volcano nachos though was a heaping serving of cheese chicken jalapenos pico and guac/sour cream it wasn't that good. so another star subtracted. i will not return and my overall experience left me disappointed. you fail margaritaville westgate that you actually don't deserve the name."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken is really good, and you'll get a decent-sized portion of food if you order it! 

Drinks are really good! The atmosphere is pretty wild - I saw a few dudes walking around on stilts, some girl go down a waterslide, and a very loud Jimmy Buffet concert on a giant TV. 

Prices are a little expensive, but this place is definitely worth stopping in if you're looking for a nice change of pace from the Strip!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and quick with preparing drinks. Place was clean welcoming and drinks were strong ! Definitely worth the price. My fiancé ordered a 5 o clock somewhere and I order a frozen cocktail. Both were delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"Why did I go here again when I've had bad luck in the past?  Went about 2 years ago, food was just OK, service sucked.  2 years later, exact same....

Visited for lunch on a week-day.  Place was very empty.  Service was very slow.  Took an hour for lunch between seating and leaving.  Food was just OK, drinks were empty and the waitress just didn't really seem to care (and she was only handling 2 tables).  $16 for a sandwich and ice tea."}
{"text":"This place sucks hard. Jimmy buffet would never eat here I'm sure of it, and neither will I again. 

First off is the beer scam they run here where the draft price listed on the menu as five bucks. Except that's for the twelve ounce beer, also not a listed fact. Then when you order the waiter says \"would you like the twelve or the twenty-two ounce souvenir size?\" I was shrewd enough to pick up on this but they caught my friends by suprise. Anyway when you say yes to this they throw in the take home glass at which point you have to pay for the glass for ten bucks and then carry around this monument to your stupidity the rest of the night. 

Food is average atmosphere is ok service sucked but was quick. I was smart I got a shot of tequila but the rest of my friends got caught in the beer scam. 

So one star for blatant dishonesty and the beer bait and switch and general crappiness. One good thing we ate here the first thing we did on the first night of our trip and things went waay up from here. Vegas baby!"}
{"text":"Margaritas, music, average food, fun times, the Flamingo Hotel, I must be on vacation. This is my favorite tourist trap to eat at when we are in Vegas. I love to have Margaritas before noon, truly the breakfast of champions. 

I have to start with staff and the great service they provide, keep up the great job crew. They seem to be happy working here and it shows. My kids love the people on stilts making balloons for everyone young and old. Funny hats, animals, swords, and \"special\" balloons for bachelorette parties. Cover the kids eyes.

My wife and I think the food is okay. We usually order some cheese burgers or chicken fingers for the kids, my wife likes the coconut shrimp, and I will try some fish tacos. What we really enjoy are the nachos, they are the bomb!  Be warned, the nachos are a meal of their own. 

What gives this joint the 4 stars is the vacation atmosphere and the Margaritas. Must tries are the Perfect Margarita, the Pink Cadillac, the Pomegranate, and the Who's to Blame Margarita. I guarantee, after you try all of them you will be in paradise."}
{"text":"The nachos are probably the best hangover food you will ever have. My boyfriend and I shared them and were absolutely stuffed so we didn't order entrees. We both got margs and they were mediocre. I would say this place is a bit overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I was there last week and had the fish of the day - salmon.  The food was good.
I was at the bar in the back and service was slow.  I ordered the perfect margarita and it was ok - but a little weak as compared to the past.  I had 3 perfect margarita's and should have been feeling it a lot more than I was.  I don't think the bartender was making the drinks right.
In the past this has been a 4-5 start place in my mind."}
{"text":"Burgers here come frozen and taste like you could get them at a mediocre high school football game's snack shack. In and Out tastes better."}
{"text":"This was my sister and I's last stop on our b-day bar crawl. We got two beers and the buffalo wings. The wings were tasty, the music was loud and rockin' and our server was a hoot, very outgoing and friendly. Perfect place to party and drink, not such a good place if you just want to relax."}
{"text":"This place is the best I visit once a year and am sure to stop in every time. Me and my crazy girls are always taken care of by the one and only best \"kalah\" he is simply amazing and the crew always shows us a great visit will be sure to come back soon for handsome bartender and kick ass nachos:)"}
{"text":"Had the tinga chicken and it tasted pretty bad and slimy. Prices are way too high for the quality"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times a year over the last 5 years and it is consistent.  The nachos are HUGE but could be layered better.  The club sandwich is always on point.  COLD beer and quick service."}
{"text":"Really just kind of bland and boring.  Carne asada was way over cooked, black beans were tasty, nachos were alright.  It's way over priced,  but that's what you get in vegas.  Their mixed drinks are really the only highlight."}
{"text":"No food allowed on rooftop which is inconvenient. During Cavs playoff game (game 7 versus Celtics) they stopped serving food at 9 something and stopped serving drinks at 10:30. Also Memorial Day weekend FYI. Make a plan to go somewhere else for a game."}
{"text":"Convenient place from the hotel to grab a bite and a margarita. I mean... you haaave to get a margarita from Margaritaville. If you want more of a liquor taste, definitely get your margarita on the rocks because they're pretty generous with the amount of tequila they pour. 

Also have had one of their burgers here, and oh my goodness was it huge and filling. Had a juicy patty and a heaping amount of fries on the side. 

Also, don't forget to watch the volcano explode! Try to sit in the center for the genuine experience."}
{"text":"i love this place, great drinks and food... awesome entreatment"}
{"text":"Now THIS is my kinda place!!!  We loved it so much we were back twice within the 3 days we spent in Vegas.  The food is delicious and the entertainment at night is awesome as well.  I had the wings the first night we were there and my boyfriend had a cheeseburger, two foods that sounds extremely ordinary but were so much more than that!  We had a great time there and I just know we'll be going back every time we visit!"}
{"text":"Food was great -- I ordered the clam chowder, which was delicious. Service was pretty good as well. The only irritating thing, was when they flash the lights during the music videos, but it's not on every music video.  I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This is a good place for a meal and entertainment for adults. We went with a large group and they took good care of us. It was fairly loud,but that's part of the environment. Its right on the strip and they have a large selection of food. I would like to think of this place as a rainforest cafe for adults, in a way because there were people sliding down slides and yelling and singing every so often as animals do at rainforest cafe. That being said, its not a kid friendly place(That is why I only gave it 3 stars)., but it is Las vegas. Its good for adults,but I did see several kids while there. I had fun while there, but I would probably not choose to go to it again until I am over the age of 21."}
{"text":"Thanks for the giant cup of pineapple juice. Waste of 25 bucks. Worse place ever to get a drink. Don't go here."}
{"text":"I had some of the absolute worst food of my entire life here.  I like Jimmy Buffet and I live in New Orleans where we also have a Margaritaville but the food at the New Orleans location is exponentially better than this place even though it still isn't that great.  The shrimp here were horrible with the texture of gummy bears and I've never experienced such atrocious seafood.  The food was all bland and even \"spicy\" dishes had no flavor!  I'm really confused why they can't seem to do drinks and food at least on par with the similarly themed but far better executed Bahama Breeze chain that isn't that far a ride from here (tip: go there if you're in the mood for a tropical themed restaurant and you will be FAR happier). The big bonus is you can get wasted away again in Margaritaville on margaritas here but the bad news is they aren't that great here and I wish they had prickly pear flavored ones like the Z'Tejas chain does. I know this is the most profitable restaurant in America so please Jimmy get some quality control on the food going through here!  A good Gulf Coast boy like Mr. Buffet needs to be embarrassed to have served food like this even if he is laughing all the way to the bank."}
{"text":"Cheesy in a good way.  I felt like I was eating dinner on spring break here.  Huge vat of margarita with pouring spout, tacky boat decor, dvd of Jimmy buffet concerts playing, and waiters wearing hawaiian shirts.  It sounds like I'm knocking this place, but I had a lot of fun with my friends here.  The atmosphere is really casual especially for vegas.  It looked like a SF fisherman's wharf crowd here if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"My aunt is a Parrothead so we went here for her birthday.  My sister and I weren't feeling that great after some bad food at Buca di Beppo earlier in the day so we just ordered soup and salad.  The tortilla soup tasted like those Taco Bell seasoning packets, but it helped settle my stomach a little.  The salad was worse, the lettuce was dry and stale so neither of us ate it.  Also, we had a reservation for \"VIP seating\" but we still had to wait 20 minutes and the table was just like any other table in the middle of the place.  However - my aunt had a blast enjoying the Jimmy Buffett music videos and her birthday balloon hat, so that's why I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Margaritaville has always been one of my go-to breakfast spots in Vegas. On my last trip, however, I was with a (too large) group of girls and we didn't make it in time for breakfast. I was disappointed but decided that lunch was worth a try. Glad we stayed and dined. I ordered the seafood bisque and caesar salad along with a bahama mama. Both food and drink were delicious and fairly reasonable (price-wise) by Vegas standards. The review would have been a 4 but the service was off-it was very friendly, but we spent a lot of time waiting and it wasn't really busy. 

I will certainly be back on future trips."}
{"text":"This is my favorite margaritaville of all time! I come to this location when ever I get the chance when I am in Las Vegas! The service is always good! 

The drinks are a little pricey but after all it is the Las Vegas strip! 

This time we had the crab cake sandwich which was very tasty! The beach club was for my boyfriend and he enjoyed it very much! 

The drinks we had a land shark beer, a pomegranate and blueberry margarita and the zombie and one point harbor! All the cocktails were delicious but at 11.25 a glass it's a bit steep. But none the less worth it."}
{"text":"Visiting my parents we came here and had some fun with great drinks and food they had a great selection of Margaritas even a spicy one so we will return"}
{"text":"Horrible experience here. Checked in at 10:05 for breakfast. Was told it would be a 25 minute wait. Waited for almost an hour but were told we could still get breakfast which ended at 11 because we checked in before 10:30am. Were sat at 11 and ordered breakfast. Waited another half hour. When they brought the food, the hollandaise sauce was on it and I had asked for it on the side. So they took it back. Waited fifteen minutes for them to re-do it. When they brought it the second time, the eggs were so overcooked, it was like having two hard boiled eggs sitting on an english muffin. I asked for the manager who promptly came over. When I showed her that the eggs were overcooked, she said she didn't know if they could remake it because breakfast was over, but she'd try. Huh? Isn't she the manager? Can't she tell them what to make? It was clear the eggs had been made in advance and sitting there under heat lamps for a while. We waited another twenty minutes. By this time, my fiance's done with his meal and just sitting and waiting for mine to come. The manager finally comes back with a freshly made eggs benedict which was good and tells us she'll comp the whole meal. So kudos to her for taking care of it properly, but it took way too long for us to get to that point. Would have much rather just paid for the meal and been able to actually eat together."}
{"text":"Overrated.

The wait to eat here was about an hour. We thought it would be worth it, so we stuck it out. When we finally made it to the table, we looked over the menu. It was a list of unimpressive and basic overpriced food. The drink list is more creative, but not creative enough to justify the prices. All the cocktails sounded like sugar concoctions with splashes of alcohol. 

Our waiter was the typical chain restaurant waiter, just enough personality to be pleasant. The service was slow and we felt as if we were waiting for the majority of our meal. 

The decor was extravagant and over the top. Model ships and fishing gear were placed around almost every table. There were screens and TVs scattered across the walls playing Jimmy Buffet-esqe music videos. 

The dinner show was \"the straw that broke the camel's back\" for me. People danced around on stilts and a woman in a bikini took a dive into a tank that was about 20 feet from our table. It is silly and unnecessary."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  This is only a review of the Margarita itself, which is all we ordered from here.  

Who would have thought that the WORST margaritas on the strip that we had, would be from a place named after them?  My wife brought back 3 drinks for a few of us, 2 \"Uptown Top Shelf\" margaritas, and one watermelon margarita, all on the rocks.

They were so sweet and \"syrup-y\" that it was hard to drink (and I couldn't drink more than a few sips of mine)... there was no apparent alcohol even in the drinks, nor was any effect of tequila or alcohol noticed from even my wife after finishing hers (and she's a light weight!).  Had it not been the fact is was a 5-minute walk back to where we were gaming, we would have returned them.  Hard to believe this place has such terrible margaritas!!!

If you want a great fast margarita, I would highly recommend La Salsa Cantina on the strip!  Lightyears better in both taste and alcohol content."}
{"text":"um... so basically similar review to Westgate City Center review:

old people place? lol sorry everyone, but if its not rocking out some recent rock or hip hop.... its older people place.  Not sure what to expect since I'm coming from LA, I guess not as bad of a review unless I lived in Vegas uh? haha

Music: LIVE BAND! Always awesome if its live.  And they have a little hip hop/main stream music near the end of the night, when the band takes a break?

Parking: Plenty, just gotta find which parking section is near entrance walk way toward Margaritaville.  If you see hell's then its the right area.

Atmosphere: Crowd is older than 30+, so no messed up rowdy annoying high schoolers or college crowds around?  Respectful & fun still, its what you make of it right?  Genuinely nice people.

Still a place to check out though.  And if you're a tourist, probably a good place to still check out since theres alot of restaurants & such.  So thinking this place's age crowd ranges from 30+?  Food? Didn't try & wouldn't expect anyone to come here for food, its a bar/night life type of place.... or was that only Vegas?"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! Fast and delicious! Very happy we decided to check out this place! #Yummy"}
{"text":"Yumm.. What's better then getting a yummy margarita on a Sunday morning. I tell you, it's the breakfast of champions! 

After a adventurous night from before, my girls and I decided to take a stroll down the strip and grab a hearty breakfast to soak up all the alcohol consumed. We decided to stop by Margaritaville since I've always wanted to try this place out.  Although it was an hour wait, we didn't mind since our poor feet needed a rest from the high heels we wore the other night. 

We ordered the huge nachos, buffalo wings and to be healthy, the Asian salad and of course, a side of strawberry margarita. 
All this, was able to feed 3 starving girls. We even had left overs to take back. The strawberry margarita and nachos totally hit the spot! I was in complete heaven! The salad helped wash down all the greasy fried goodness.  

I can't wait to go back and try all the other items on the menu. I haven't found a margarita as good as this place yet!"}
{"text":"We ate there at 5:00 PM on a Monday and it was very noisy.  We ordered appetizers of soft pretzels and a crab dip with crackers.  There were four large pretzels and after a few bites dipped in the brown mustard, they got old quickly.  There was also a small cup of cheese sauce...maybe more of that would have been better.  We didn't finish the pretzels.  The crab dip and crackers was a small portion for $13.95.  $9.95 would have been a fair price.  The service was fine.  Perhaps the drinks are better but after having numerous free drinks in the casinos it seemed silly to spend more money on drinks."}
{"text":"I had dinner here when I was staying at the Flamingo... they're conveniently attached to each other. 

It's a chain, in Vegas, attached to a hotel/casino so you can expect the prices to be slightly higher.  But it wasn't too too bad.

The nacho grande platter was great! We got 2 for the table and they were definitely the highlight of the food for us.  I got a burger that was good, not thrilling, but good.  The fries had nice seasoning.  And the bartender definitely knew how to pour a good, strong drink.  

The atmosphere is very cool.  They had a few big screens playing random Buffett concerts and one of them was over a stage, so I assume on some nights they do some sort of live show.

Overall I had a very decent experience.  Nothing spectacular, but there were no glaring negatives either."}
{"text":"People great. Turkey burger lousy. Taco salad very good. Nachos huge. Top shelf margarita awesome. Great place for a casual lunch at a reasonable price (for Vegas)."}
{"text":"Drinks were strong.  They had a gluten free menu and there was only a 15 minute wait.  It was delicious and filling.  The atmosphere, though really loud at times, is a lot of fun!!  They have stilt walkers who do a show every 30 minutes and make balloon hats for random people.  It's a lot of fun and worth the experience.  Reasonably priced as well.  Mom LOVED the seafood mac and cheese.  We left tipsy and satisfied."}
{"text":"So I worked in a Restaurant and was a bartender back in the day. We got put on a 3 hour waiting list. I thought it was going to be busy. Nine open tables when we went in to the bar to grab a drink. The first bar seats about 30 people they had 5 bartenders and 1 bar back. It took 30 minutes to get a drink. I wanted one lime margarita blended and one peach. They told me they don't blend margaritas. I ask for malibu they dont have that. I ask for my margarita on the rocks, it was bad to find out they ran out of sweet and sour. They did mot know what a shooter was and they brought are nachos cold. The bartenders are rude and have no clue what they are doing."}
{"text":"Great place to go for any occasion. I have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed.  Best margaritas in Vegas.   The food is excellent and atmosphere is energetic with an hourly show and stilt performers walking around making baloon hats."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like this place. The food was good, but we had to wait a long time for it to arrive at the table. The service was friendly and fairly attentive. The music was so loud we were yelling to hear each other.  It was very expensive for just average food, so not a great value."}
{"text":"I've always liked Margaritaville as a port in a touristy storm.  I know I can come in and get a good drink and listen to some really good music.  The food is so-so.  My husband and I stopped in on 9/1 and shared the combo fajitas.  They weren't sizzling when they came to the table, but the flavor was alright.  They seemed to me like they had been sitting in a warmer tray or something, but what do you expect when the place is packed?  They can't cook each one to order or it would take forever.  We also had a side of 3 coconut shrimp which were a greasy little treat.  I don't eat much fried food, but I did enjoy my 1 1/2 shrimp.  

The drinks were great as always and Jimmy on the big screen was great escapism from the crowded chaos of The Strip.  I was impressed with the hostesses up front who have to manage the flow of traffic coming in that joint.  People don't pay any attention and just walk on up to the dining room when they need to check in with the hostess first, and there was always someone there to guide them in the right direction whether it was back to the hostess or on to one of the 4 bars.  Our server was very friendly and on time with refills & the check.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Received a reply to my first review so, we went back to give Margaritaville another try.  To my surprise they've changed the menu.  So I tried the fried chicken.  My wife got it in Memphis and said it was great.  Still skeptical of my last experience I tried it.  The chicken wasn't dried out and the mashed potatoes were good.  Wouldn't say it was the best chicken i've had but a major step in the right direction.  Still love the lava lava shrimp."}
{"text":"Ultimate Margaritas is necessary. Ultimate Nachos is necessary. That's all you need here."}
{"text":"Very touristy, but I guess that's what Vegas is about. The ambiance was heavily beach themed and Jimmy Buffet centered, so provided you like those 2 things, this might be the place for you. The place is huge and can handle large groups, so it makes for a more fun time.
I was expecting more from the drinks, but they weren't as strong as I thought a margarita with 3 different types of tequila should be. 
The food was plentiful and tasty, but everything was a little more expensive than I thought was appropriate for a place like this. If I could give it a 3.5, I would."}
{"text":"I have been to a few other Margaritavilles around the country and this one is much the same. Over priced drinks! Crappy over produced food and poorly trained and overworked staff. This is a giant expensive piece of property and once the novelty wears off it will close! There are far better options in walking distance. Hint their perfect margarita is not perfect. It is stronger that it needs to be and it was tiny! Nachos were pretty good but they brought out the appetizer nachos only a few seconds before the entree's. I hate that! The ribs were burnt to a crisp but the fries and slaw were pretty good! The other three people I went with didn't like the turkey burger or fish tacos either. If it wasn't for the good people watching and the fun atmosphere I would give it a one star!"}
{"text":"We ordered the nachos, tortilla soup and a California chicken sandwich. We also ordered a Bahama Mama drink.

Nachos = Good - It was  huge and very messy, very good, but nothing out of the ordinary (except for size)

Tortilla soup = good, but it was more like a chili, it actually went well with the nachos.

Chicken sandwich = very good, came with fries. My son really enjoyed it.

Bahama Mama: poor, the drink was small and not very tasty. I told my wife if Margarita is in the restaurant's name, then maybe she should have ordered that.

The food was good, the service was fine. We probably wouldn't return without a groupon or other discount as the food was a little overpriced and nothing special."}
{"text":"Some of the best prices in Vegas for drinks 5 cent beers 5 dollar drink my favorite was the zombie that will get you going quickly I recommend going there"}
{"text":"Go for the drinks, pass on the food. Went for dinner and waited about 1/2 hour for table. Server greeted us and got our drinks coming, We ordered the nachos and the fish and chips to share. Nachos ended up being a pile of chips with nacho cheese sauce, a teaspoon of sour cream and guacamole, some meat and beans. They would probably be okay if I was hungover and starving. The fish and chips were very good. the server never brought extra plates and we ended up eating over our napkins. Prices don't match the quality of food, or service. Unless you really like Jimmy Buffett or Margaritaville and don't mind supporting his island vibe empire. Pass"}
{"text":"Awesome time with the family. I mean the tequilla didn't hurt, but it was good food, good music and live entertainment.  Mt three boys loved the dancing betty in a swimsuit.  Kinda pricey though."}
{"text":"Stopped in during my last stop in Vegas...had some nice Mango margaritas and the bartender picked one up as it was my 40th birthday.
How then could they not have \" a Pirate looks at 40 \"somehwere on their video loop?? Almost blashemy...but i had another margarita and got over it.
their Jerk pasta special was nice for dinner...not overly spicy but enough zang to make it interesting. Overall...a ok."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere super strong margaritas but tasted alright. Waitress was really friendly. Had fish tacos they were pretty tasty. Other couple with us got the massive nachos and they looked and tasty very good. Was enough for four people"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time here! Jimmy our waiter was PHENOMENAL. He was super polite and quick to answer any questions. Will definitely be back to have him take care of us again. Thanks Jimmy!"}
{"text":"Got our waters.....waited for 15 minutes for our waitress named miss eve or eva supposively the best according to the hostess and we had.to leave never came back on a non busy night. First and last time here.... Oh well"}
{"text":"This place was okay.. 

we came with a party of 8.. had to wait over an hour to be seated. Def not worth the wait because its just a burger place. I received the same service and quality food as an Islands. The only outstanding thing is the choices of drinks and cool decor. Such as the huge margarita (where theres a girl inside dancing) and the volcano (another girl dancing)"}
{"text":"Tequilas maravilhosas, ambiente bem mexicano, comida mais ou menos, atendimento 10 a preços razoáveis."}
{"text":"I went during happy hour, got a $5 margarita on the rocks that put me on my ass lol...super strong! I took the advise of others on here and ordered the Volcano Nachos and they did not steer me wrong. Deff going back here on my next Vegas trip"}
{"text":"My husband and I sat at the bar. He ordered the jambalaya and I ordered the shrimp and grits. Both were very good. Adam at the bar makes great, strong drinks! No complaints at all. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great music! Good cover bands! I have too many good memories here! Haha but it would have been 5stars if the lady bartender wouldn't act like mother.. She thinks you're a lot more drunk then it seems! I mean after 2 beers she is going to ask me \"are you sure?\" chill out next time... But overall great place! Haha"}
{"text":"Best place for Nachos, burgers, beer and MARGARITAS of course.  We always take our friends and family who are visiting for a great dinner. Never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"A group of us decided to stop in this place for lunch.  The decor, for me, not appealing, but the food turned out to be REALLY good.  I ordered the catch of the day fish sandwich.  One of the best fish sandwiches I've had.  A friend of mine had the fish tacos and loved them.  There was a party of six of us and we all really enjoyed the food.  Perfect stop for lunch in Vegas.  The services was very good as well."}
{"text":"We had a server by the name of Britney. She was amazing. She knew the menu and drink combos very well and was very attentive to our needs. By far the best server we have ever had. She recommended the volcano nachos with chicken. Amazing!!! Thanks Britney."}
{"text":"It isn't horrible, and the open air is nice.  The food is standard.  We came here for Caribbean music and conch fritters and they had neither.  They had old guy rock and lots of carby foods that just aren't my taste.  

The unionized waiters wearing their commie looking union pins were distraction from the laid back, beach feel I had hoped for.  

Won't be back.  But it wasn't tragic.  Just a general waste of a night in Vegas."}
{"text":"Every time I am in vegas I stop off to get dinner here at least once. My wife and I went on 1/21/14 and we were not impressed. For the first time ever we left thinking we would have been better off eating somewhere else. We got two orders of wings, one was waaaayyyyy to spicy and the other waaaayyy to sweet. Ive ordered them at least a dozen times but that night neither flavor was very good. The band playing was so-so and we have for sure seen much better there. We found ourselves praying for the music to stop so we could have a conversation. This was the only time we didn't enjoy our time there and Im sure the food was the main issue. I mean heck the better the food the more fun you have and the more you get into the band that's playing. But not that night."}
{"text":"I have been dying to visit this place for awhile. Like since I turned 21, but the whole avoiding the strip thing kinda got in the way.

Anywho -  I went on Saturday around lunch time and we had about a 15 minute wait. Not bad for the strip. We waited a good 10 minutes after we were seated for our server to come by. She recommended the Bahama Mama, which was awesome! It almost tasted like a 50/50 bar, but it had an interesting kick to it. We settled on the nachos for our entree. It looks huge, but I will say that 70% of the nachos is chips. They were still really tasty, and we had leftovers. We indulged and ordered dessert - the brownie. It's chocolate and ice cream - no point in reviewing that. Of course it was delicious!

Overall, I really liked this place. I hope that I can convince one of my buds to join me soon."}
{"text":"Margaritaville is Margaritaville ....  It's obviously a chain and there are several all over the country but I don't think people go for the 5-star food options.  It's a chill place where you listen to Jimmy Buffet with amazing frozen drinks and a pretty guaranteed fun time.  It's over-priced for everything but it's because you're there for the experience more than anything.  It's one of those places you go for the atmosphere and take out-of-towners, definitely not an every weekend place."}
{"text":"I always try to make it here whenever I'm in Vegas. Drinking the free booze from the tables vs. drinking the margaritas from Margaritaville is just simply a huge difference. I like to start my night off here, get a few margaritas, get dinner/drinks, then get the free casino table booze so that I remember drinking good booze that night. 

I love how they have live shows here and their finger food is pretty good as well. Can't wait until my next trip!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!! We went in around 11pm, when they were only serving their late night menu. We were told to seat ourselves, so we headed to a table right in the middle of the restaurant, next to, two other full tables.

We waited 15 minutes, no one came to our table, we watched 3 other servers walk by. After having to go ask someone up front to get our server, finally our server came by and got our order.. with no apology for the wait.

We ordered a burger and wings. Our burger came out wrong. Our server never came back to check on us.. so we pushed the burger to the edge of the table. Finally another 20 minutes later, he came by and asked how things were..

After we told him everything that we were mad about, he never apologized or asked if he could do anything to fix it. Just said he would comp our bill, and walked away!!!"}
{"text":"A+++++++++++

Hostess said 10 min wait... We were sitting at our table within 3. 

Our server, PRISCILLA, was AMAZING!! My fiancé and I are both in the restaurant industry, and she checked every box on what a great server should be- friendly, attentive, fast, etc etc. She suggested a great margarita for me, and checked on us frequently throughout our meal. My favorite thing about her was that she was personal and not the general \"is everything ok here\" she knew exactly our situation and where we should be in our meal

Food was also fantastic! Everything came out fast and hot. Drinks also came out fast and were much stronger than normal casual restaurant drinks!

What a great experience at Margaritaville because of Priscilla!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun place on the strip.  Waitress was great, but wasn't happy when we asked to split the ticket."}
{"text":"Awesome environment! Very kid friendly. Awful food! One of the worst burgers I have ever eaten! And way overpriced! I have been to a different location and the food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"The worst experience I've had in Vegas. Started off with the nachos which were ok at best. We got the burger and the tacos and they were nothing to right home about. What really gets me is the horrible and I mean horrrrrrrible service. Truly hope our waitress was having an off day but she was downright rude. Seemed as we were an inconvenience to her. Sat and watched as all the tables around us came in, sat after us and got their food way before us. The manager came over and gave us the nachos and a round of drinks for free (which was much appreciated) but the waitress continued to act as if we didn't wait an entire hour for our entree. Won't see me back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner, we got buffalo chicken wings and the nachos. As for drinks. I got the strawberry daiquiri and my friend got fins to the left, which is a margarita which has blue curacao. She said it was tasty and the strawberry daiquiri was tasty as well. The nachos were huge! perfect for hangovers. Great Service and Great food."}
{"text":"I really only came here when it was time for music and dancing. So I don't have an opinion on the food or dining service. I liked it better on Tuesday than Friday. Friday night it looked like a cheap club and it was disappointing. But on Tuesday, it still had the music, the dancing, and the drinking without the cheap feeling. I had a platinum margarita, which I expected to be white and it was green. It was delicious. I had several other drinks I can't recall anymore... :). If I ever come back to Vegas I know I will come here again."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is the location! Terribly slow service and mediocre food. Don't bother!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun. There is a huge blender by the bar and fishing boats with tables in them. I saw several plates of the volcano nachos go past and they looked like the would feed 4-5 people. I stayed with a typical club sandwich - it's hard to mess that up. It came with fries and a pickle spear. The music was loud but not so much that you couldn't carry a conversation at the table. Next door is the Margaritaville gift shop where anything Jimmy Buffet or beach related can be purchased."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The delicious fish sandwich and good cold landshark beer! The environment was good and I love Jimmy Buffet on the t.v. screens of his own restaurant! I plan to get another sandwich before I leave Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why so many people go to this place.  Everything's so expensive, they never have any great deals and the food is mediocre at best.  My friend and I had 1 plate of nachos (appetizer) and 3 beers and the total came out to 30 dollars.  On top of this, the gratuity was added and the waitress didn't say anything so we accidentally tipped her more on top so we paid almost 50 dollars!  She could've let us know if she wasn't so greedy..  I tried to complain on the website but the only thing you can do is give them information to set up a party.  What a rackett!"}
{"text":"Y'know, I'd probably hate this place if it weren't in Las Vegas, but Jimmy's is actually kind of a nice momentary escape from the drone of clanging slot machines and flashing lights of the casinos.

I like sitting upstairs on the outdoor deck where there's a great view of Bellagio and Caesar's. Perched at the far end of the bar under one of the \"misters\" with a big rum drink in hand is a small slice of Vegas heaven.

I ordered the loaded nachos \"appetizer\" with a friend on a recent visit and that ended up being our appetizer, dinner and dessert as the serving was easily larger than my head! Probably the best bargain on the menu in that it can easily feed 2-3 grown men."}
{"text":"Had the Volcano Nachos yesterday, and they were mediocre at best. The frozen Margarita was good."}
{"text":"Another great visit to Margaritaville last night! We went with a party of 7 and sat out on the patio. Fortunately, we got there before the Coyotes game got out because the place was a ZOO after the game let out but that didn't stop our server, Jason, for continuing to provide us with EXCELLENT service. Our drinks were kept full, our food was delivered hot, and he was friendly and fun.  Several of us enjoyed the Cheeseburger in Paradise, while one friend had the Seafood Mac and Cheese which was delish. Another friend shared the fish tacos which are super fresh and perfectly grilled. We all shared the Volcano Nachos which are HUGE. I don't know if they are $15.00 worth of huge, but they were big, hot, fresh, and yummy.  We had the Chocolate Hurricane which was by far the best dessert there and I've tried them all. (and no I'm not ashamed of that either. :P ) We had a great time and are looking forward to our next visit back!"}
{"text":"Jimmy Buffett would be ASHAMED with what is happening at this particular restaurant. I really don't see him kicking back with a margarita and listening to loud R&B music with flashing studio lights.  The ambiance was LOUD and frat boy-esque.  There were NO tables away from the blasting music... and it was quite dark inside.  The volcano nachos were weird... SERIOUSLY???? Cheese whiz on 15 buck nachos??? They were large in portion... but NOT worth hot dog stand quality cheese.  The soup i had was okay... nothing to write home about. We had to flag down a waitress about 4 times... but she WAS \"swamped\" so... who knows?! Margarita was alright... the atmosphere really ruined everything. NO GOOD."}
{"text":"Horrible service by the taller black waitress. She was very impatient with zero customer service skills. Her tip was a direct reflection of that.  The bourban salmon was disgusting, rice was cold. My dads meal was pretty good. He ordered mahi mahi.  I thought the prices are overpriced for the quality of the food. And the menu doesnt have a large variety of food. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Yummy margaritas and a bbq pork sandwich was the kick of this place.  I'm not a big Jimmy Buffett fan, but it's a hip place to check out.  We ate on the 2nd floor away from the crowd and our waitress was nice.  She gave us a souvenir glass for free.  There are a lot of people that get a second round of drinks to go to drink on the strip.  How often does that happen when you are on not on vacation?  ;)"}
{"text":"I'm trying to give this place a chance but the food is over priced and not good at all. I've been to this location 3 times and each time I got margaritas which were disgusting and seem to have very little alcohol in it very disappointing considering that this place is called Margaritaville. My brother ordered the jambalaya and didn't have any flavor at all. I ordered a southwest salad the chicken was overcooked and dry"}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in Vegas. I live for the Volcano nachos and they never disappoint. I don't advise ordering the nachos for one person. It is a shareable dish."}
{"text":"when ever we are in Las Vegas we go to eat at Margarittaville, the food choice is amazing as is the portion size, they have a family area and adult so for all the family, and ideal for couples, singles, we sit at the bar as we want several drinks and food, last time I had the British Fish and Chips ( fries) it was amazing, large portion, freshly cooked, tasted amazing, my husband had the Nachos that looked so huge and tasted even better, the food is great value, the drinks cold refreshing and great prices. staff are so friendly, they even can cater for weddings, there even have tables where you can gamble, eat and drink all at the same time, but no matter what you order there you will be amazed on the portion size for the price, for all Brits like Myself who go remember bar staff and waitresses and waiters work for tips, so tip 20% of the bill.  but you should check this place out as you will be thankful you did. you may have to wait for a table as does get busy, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We go to Margaritaville numerous times a year and have a great time.  We take visitors to it.  Last night was not as great as usual.  The Host staff was having a bad day and did not want to be at work.  We had 7 in the group and it took 40 minutes to get seated at 2 round tables.  They seat several groups of 5 & 6  before us (they came in after us)  They could have seated us right away if they planned to give us 2 tables.  We could not talk with the other table and it made it tough to share nachos.  Food was great and Jeff our server was awesome!  He made up fro the poor host staff. 
Not sure I will take friends to Margaritaville for a while.  We would have stayed longer and spent more but we went somewhere else so we could seat together."}
{"text":"This is a busy place, plan for a long wait, if you dont have kids you can do this in the festive bar.
If you go for dinner-time, you will be quite entertained once an hour with two Buffet classics, 'Volcano' and Margaritaville (with a bikini-clad girl sliding down the faux-volcano into a giant blue margarita where she gyrates and swims, and then dances with the rest of the characters in the place (two on stilts).  You cant help but sing along and smile.  
My wife and her friend shared the volcano nachos and that was too much for them - although my wife complained about the use of Velveeta (in the middle, real cheese had been sprinkled on top) and the fact that even if you order it 'chicken' it still is loaded with beef (because of the chili, the waiter claimed).
I had the Jambalaya, mildly spicy, tons of rice and not much of the andouille (spelling?) sausage and a few shrimp, very filling and tasted good.  Son had the Cheeseburger (in Paradise) and wolfed that down.  Other son had fajitas which smelled fantastic and he said he liked.
The characters on stilts were doing balloon art/sculptures, and they came by, and made flower hats for the ladies, I tipped her $5 (my wife FREAKED out, I thought that was about right, she thought I was overboard)
Weird thing, some gal comes round, with beads and trinkets and leis, spouting something about  \"Save the TaTas\", I could barely hear over the din, wanting me to donate and I would receive some trinket in exchange, I said no....later my wife explained it was for breast cancer, duh, BUT, on reflecting I dont think I'd believe any donated cash I gave in a casino-related facility in Las Vegas would EVER reach its final destination.
So, prices were pretty high, and the 1hr wait, and the ok food gets this joint 3 stars.  The entertainment and lively ambience made it fun to go to."}
{"text":"This place is everything that you need in Vegas. Just stop by and get a massive drink to share with your friends and keep going!"}
{"text":"Are here for late lunch. Husband had cheeseburger.  I had fish tacos.  Both okay not terrific. Too pricey for a burger, He compared it to a Wendy's burger. Drinks are $7.00. They were smallish size and allot of ice. But for the price of  the food you would think there would be a more personal touch and maybe even homemade fries verses frozen, I would suggest fast food for a third of the price that you pay here. I don't see this place making it. 
Cute decor. server was friendly
Hostess area lacking. Won't be back.  I like the vibe at the real beaches."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here last Thursday.  Place is alright.  Had a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger with fries and a dill pickle with some beer which was pretty bomb aside from the fact that I was really hungry.  They also serve buckets of beer over here.  Chill spot for a change in scenery from stuffing your face at those overpriced buffets.  Expect to drop around $20-$25 each here with a meal and a couple drinks."}
{"text":"Margaritaville provided Store More Self Storage with two $25 gift certificates for their restaurant for a charity yard sale my store was having to benefit the American Cancer Society!  They are tenants of ours and have been amazingly easy to work with, always displaying a positive attitude and enthusiasm!  I have personally eaten at the restaurant and the food and service is always outstanding!  A big 2 thumbs up for Margaritaville!!!"}
{"text":"For the longest time I would walk by and never come in.  I didn't even have the slightest clue that it was a restaurant until I finally stumbled into Margaritaviile on VDay.  Since it was 1 am we only had a house margarita.  super generous and satisfying!  This weekend I came by here again and was able to try the food.  To my surprise it was actually really good!  I had the coconut shrimp with fries and of course with another margarita!
yummy food and a good place on the strip to come catch a buzz!"}
{"text":"Go hungry and get the volcano nachos.  That should be enough to fill you up, as well as a few of your friends.  Wait to order entrees because I find myself full before they arrive everytime.

Watch the show because it is really entertaining.  I don't know that I really understand the guys on stilts coming out, but I liked seeing them nonetheless.  The woman who slides down the volcano and lands in the margarita glass is classic.  Drink heavily for an especially good time.  This place has a ton of stuff going on.

There is a gift shop with all kinds of Jimmy Buffett items for sale.  This is a fun place to poke around while you are waiting for your table.  The location of this restaurant is across the street from Caesar's Palace in the Flamingo Hotel."}
{"text":"What I would like to know is why all hostesses couldn't be as wonderful and friendly as Melody at Margaritaville she is such a joy they need to give her a raise and they need to keep her working forever she's a wonderful woman and really makes Margaritaville Sean."}
{"text":"Apparently peope don't like Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville. Smelly atmosphere, long waits, tourist trap...

I actually had a decent time there, and maybe it was because I was there during lunch hour on a weekday. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was very good...and like four Patron margaritas. 

I can see how it could get packed and ugly, but it was great when I was there..."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Margaritaville and I will start by saying that I do not drink, so I cant speak to that aspect of the establishment. 
We came in to the restaurant right as they were opening and got in to a table quickly, they were very accommodating of our 10 month twins, and they have the nicest high chairs we have had in a restaurant, plastic and comfortable with a descent strap (while most places have those token wood ones)
Other than the initial greeting the service want too great and the server did seem a bit annoyed that we kept asking for things like refills or a side of ranch since my wife didn't care for their raspberry vinaigrette. 
I or course ordered the coconut shrimp, as I love a good coconut shrimp and have always heard they have the best! I have had their Costco frozen ones which are actually pretty good, but these things were just awesome! They were huge and oh so tasty! The dipping sauce was really good though a bit heavy on the horseradish, and they only give you a tiny ramekin so I have to get a second one to finish out my shrimp. The fries were also really tasty; perfectly crispy and well seasoned. 
My wife ordered a burger of some kind but I honestly cant remember what was on it, but again it was pretty tasty, a bit undercooked for her taste (and what she asked for) but would have been perfect for me. She still liked it though, and it was a nice big burger with lots of tasty toppings. 
The atmosphere was really cool and though a bit run down it wasn't as cheesy as it could have been, we were sat in that back of what looked like a fishing boat so that was fun too.
I will certainly go to a Margaritaville again if I am near one, and though (like everything in Vegas) it was quite overpriced, I think it was worth it."}
{"text":"I'm really glad we decided to dine here. There was a bit of a wait at 6:00 on a Tuesday, but we expected it. After we were seated, our server came over and asked if we wanted to hear the drink specials. After he described the sangria (we are not wine drinkers, so we don't usually order sangria) we ordered a pitcher of it, and it was awesome. Our server was great, and very personable. They have people walking around on stilts making conversation and entertaining people. I thought that was a little odd, but they seemed nice. There was a little show during the dinner where they make the volcano \"erupt\", and the girl slides into the giant blender. It was fun and cute. 

I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich, and it was great. Great flavor, but a little on the messy side. My partner in crime ordered the diablo burger. To both of us, it seemed a little bland and definitely not spicy. 

Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience."}
{"text":"The food and margaritas are both a huge disappointment for me here... I went to different Margaritavilles in different states and this location is by far the worst. My friends and I ordered uptown margarita, last mango in paris margarita, tropical fruit margarita and perfect margarita. We all agreed that drinks weren't good, they contained very small amount of alcohol and come in regular drinking cups; not the margarita glasses.

 For appetizers, we ordered spinach artichoke dip and for my entree, I had the Jimmy's Jammin Jambalaya. The food is not great at all, BUT service makes up for everything. We had a fantastic waiter and interesting live entertainment. There's a mini show happening every 30 min-1 hour. There's two guys and one lady on walking stilts singing and a blondie dancing around. The finale is when she slides down a volcano into a huge cup of margarita at the bar section. I bet she changes into 15-20 bikinis a day!!!! Poor thing.. When they're not performing, they're crafting balloons for everyone. They made a bow and arrow for me. It was my friend's birthday so they made her a crown  with two hearts and the sign 21 on it. They're super funny and entertaining! Love it!"}
{"text":"First breakfast in Vegas. final verdict: Bad.  We ordered steak and eggs, cracked eggs and bagel and cream cheese with Coffee. Super long wait to be served. Steak was overdone and super tough, coffee was like water, hash browns eas not crispy. Complained to the server whom we couldnt find after the food was served. When we did complain, she defended. At the end, we got a 20% discount but should have not charged us for the steak and eggs at all."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in to use a $25 dining voucher I got from our hotel--one staff member highly recommended Margaritaville's Seafood Mac & Cheese, so we definitely had to go check it out. 

We ended up splitting the bowl of Mac since neither of us were too hungry...it didn't look like much, but the sauce was super rich (very tasty) and made the dish very filling. This was probably one of the best bowls of mac & cheese I've ever had, and I was sad I couldn't stuff the whole thing in my face. 

I gotta say, I loved the decor...kinda cheesy, but really fun. As a closet country fan, I loved the crap out of the music videos they projected on the wall. 

AND: the best part of our experience...our server Beth B. kicked ass. She was really attentive, very patient in answering all our questions and making sure we had everything we needed, and made us feel really welcome even though I felt like a total cheapskate for paying with a voucher. But we'll definitely be back next time to spend some real money :D"}
{"text":"So I've been living in Vegas for 8 months now and hadn't checked this place out so I figured it was a must. I dropped in on a Wednesday night.. Margaritas were good.. not too crazy expensive.. I was expecting more. We got the volcano nachos.. they were def good buuut way too much for two people. There wasn't really much going on inside. We had to wait like 20 minutes. There was a band that looked like they were getting ready but we left before they started. Overall, ok experience but won't be going again."}
{"text":"When it comes to Margaritas I am pretty biased maybe coming from New Mexico where we don't mess around when it comes to Margarita's and tend to know what true ingredients are in a top shelf margarita.. Well Margaritaville is pretty much the Applebees of Margaritas and dont even get me started about their nachos or their salsa. Anyways if your looking for a syrupy bland touristy margarita then you found your spot. As far as food goes I didn't get to try it and only had their nachos and chips and salsa which were also pretty bland. But hey they do have a cool patio that is perfect for people watching on the strip."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Food is great. They have a good variety. Drinks are awesome. Prices are reasonable. Fun atmosphere. Attached to Flamingo Hotel & Casino."}
{"text":"So this was our last stop of our last night, we all wanted to get dinner and drinks and we were passing by on the way to the hotel and thought why not.  It wasn't that crowded, but it was around 10:30PM.  We were seated in one of the boats which I loved.  Our server was very attentive and fantastic.  We got a round of 5 O'Clock Somewheres, which were the most delicious drink I've had in Vegas all week.  All of our food was cooked to perfection.  I had a steak, one person had chicken tenders and the other person had a Burger.  There was a live band playing in there, but it wasn't loud enough where we had to shout to have conversation and enjoy our dinner.  It was actually really nice and started getting very crowded near midnight - and the dance floor was hoppin'.  

Overall, I really loved it here, and will go back."}
{"text":"So, after you've partied your ass off Vegas style and you crash in bed around 6 am you're going to wake up eventually and you're going to feel like crap.  Don't waste the day.  Wake up around 1:00pm or so, walk your sorry self down to Margaritaville and plop yourself at the bar.  The best cure is \"a hair from the dog that bit you\" or whatever that weird saying is...but it's true.  Order up their biggest \"on the rocks\" top-shelf margarita and suck it down.  Ahhhh, who needs advil!   

The food is mediocre at best, it's a chain so don't expect anything better.  It's a tourist trap.  Stick with the chips and salsa or something not so drenched in cheese and you'll do okay.  

Now that Jimmy's music is bringing your headache back full circle, flag down your waitress and ask for another margarita.  This time order it in the LARGE souvenir cup that you can take with you and drink as you walk the strip.  

Booze to go.... what could be better!"}
{"text":"This was a random night out with the boyfriend. We had dinner somewhere else then walked the strip and ended up at Margaritaville. There was a live band and in between sets they played the latest hits. They have fun drinks and a variety of beer to choose from. I also noticed the food selection and wished we'd dined here instead. Will definitely revisit to try out the restaurant."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Jimmy Buffet by any means.  I think he and his parrot can go stuff themselves.  No, seriously.  Anyway, I found myself here one night with my cousin and his gf for dinner.  I had the Calypso Mahi Mahi, which was decent, but I turned out to be a fan of the island rice.  It was zesty and had some raisins in it.  Everything was just ok."}
{"text":"So we're chillin in the Bellagio lookin for food.  My drunk ass friends want wings.  Yeah try to find food at the Bellagio for less than 100 bucks lmao!!  I had avoided margaritaville in the past cuz of the association to country music... my mistake

This trip I went three times.  

The people who work there are sooooooooo nice!!!!!

Food is good!  Wings, nachos!!!

Prices are good!

Margaritas are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to see here people. This place was NOTHING to ride home about as the food was mediocre at best and the service was INSANELY slow. If I had it my way, we would NOT have had dinner here, but sometimes you just don't have a choice. I did my best to order something I might like. The Fajitas were good, but the amount of chicken they give with the sizzling platter is pathetic especially when this place is known for portion sizes. 

That being said, the decor is pretty cool. Beware of the stilts walking pirates...."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded! It is worth the wait! The wait is long though I won't lie. It took about 30 minutes at least. So we decided to go gamble a bit. I won money! :D

They have seating downstairs, upstairs, or outside. They have videos everywhere for you to watch. They get very busy.

They have this guy on stilts walking around, saying hi etc. Kinda scary.

Nevertheless, the nachos are bomb! I love them! The margaritas are really good. You can't really go wrong. I mean it is margaritaville after all. 

Come one come all. Have a good drink, great nachos, ppl watch and just chill."}
{"text":"Steak very dry. I got med well but it was way well done and dry. No flavor on green beans or mashed potatoes. I have been to another Margaritaville and it was good. This one wasn't good. Margaritas were good and strong though."}
{"text":"The food was good. the restaurant itself was extremely loud, but a fun place for kids!"}
{"text":"HH margarita $6 and Bud $4, hard to beat prices.  Also had paradise cheeseburger $15 and rancho delux burger (cheeseburger w/bacon) $16.50.  I don't consider these prices too expensive and food was better than casino food."}
{"text":"Apparently according to the bartender they don't have happy hour...so either that was short lived or he was lying"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre - but I mean do you really come here for the food? You come here for the atmosphere and  the freezing margaritas. That being said the food was decent, our service was good. and it was my birthday and I got an amazing balloon hat. Love Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time Valentine's weekend. Will absolutely come back. Our waiter, Dave, was informative and honest and gave us a great experience.  He recommended the \"It's 5 O'clock Somewhere\" drink for me and was spot on. I had the jambalaya which was about as good as I've had! Can't wait to go back, getting hungry now!"}
{"text":"This was my fourth time swinging by Margaritaville and I'm sad to say I think this place is heading downhill.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and remembered our orders but the food was horrible.  Absolutely horrible. Please bear in mind that I was with a party of six and everything, even the salad wasn't up to par, especially considering the fact that they've raised all their prices.  I believe I had ordered a Bahama Momma drink which I thought was pretty good but all the other drinks that were ordered lacked alcohol and tasted too much like sugar.  Anyways its right on the strip so I don't believe they'll go out of business but it's just a little sad to report this because I used to truly enjoying coming to Margaritaville while visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"I was fortunate to be invited/included with a hotel group who were being treated to lunch as part of this restaurant's effort to help stimulate more business in this downturned economy. Part of lunch was the \"grand tour\" of the facility which is huge, seats 1200 people, employees 200-300 and hopes for business in Las Vegas to start an upward spiral.  Even with all comped, i must say the service was efficient and friendly, food items for all 7 of us were tasty, plentiful, cooked well and imaginative. Drinks were good as well. If I had a negative, it was that the noise level is very high. But, what they do is done well. It isn't a quiet sit down type of place... its' bubbly and party time atmosphere."}
{"text":"I guess I don't get the Jimmy Buffet lovers.  But, this review is about the food and not him.  Menu selections were good.  Service was friendly but slow. And the grouper sandwich I had was pretty good.  Problem was that I had to listen to Jimmy Buffet music for the entire meal.  I guess I don't get it."}
{"text":"Love margaritaville... Until now. For overpriced food and drinks you come for the scenery. They closed the top floor \"because management said so\". Cool, so they sat us with a view of the strip... Cool, what that meant is a view of the walk next to the strip.  Whatever the nachos are great so it's worth it right? 25 minutes later no one looked at us so we're out. Manager said someone went home so they got confused... Usually don't write reviews for bad service but they sat us well after they knew the server
Left. Done with them."}
{"text":"It's Jimmy Buffet all over the place. It's a little much but it's not unusual since it's Las Vegas and it's a very tacky white people type of place. The server was awesome I forgot her name but she was great. We ordered the blender with the Bahama Mama. It's an alternative if you aren't a fan of Margaritas. It's fruity, gives you that island feel and it tastes amazeballs. We split it with a group of friends and it's about 4.5 drinks, give or take. Pretty tasty stuff and I would come back just for that. Can't say anything about food since we just got that drink."}
{"text":"The only reason I will come back to this place is maybe for a drink or two, other than that I will never eat here again. I ordered the steak and shrimp meal.  The shrimp was your average fried shrimp just as I expected so no complaints there, but on the other hand my steak was not cooked to my specifications. I ordered it medium and the first time it came out it was well done. Fail! So the server took it back and ten minutes later a second steak came out and much to my despise it was also well done. EPIC FAIL!!! So I just gave up and ate some of the dry steak. You would think that a close to $30 plate would get more attention to detail on a simple task. Not the servers fault, the cooks need more practice on steak preparation."}
{"text":"Margaritaville is always a fun atmosphere for all.  The food is definitely worth it also and reasonably priced. Each margaritaville has a signature dish they only sell at that specific one. I had the beach tacos this time and they did not disappoint!  Also ordered the Asiago crab dip and cheese curds.  Amazing.  The crab dip is my favorite thing they serve there. Check it out next time you're on vacation!"}
{"text":"Awful food, awful service! My family & I have been coming to margaritaville for years & wow this place has really gone down! It's unfortunate because we usually stay at Flamingo & regularly used to enjoy popping over to this place! Was here Friday 3/9/18 night for dinner, I had Seafood mac n'cheese. Dry & unflavored, had to ask for extra sauce! I've had this several times before & I was super excited, but unfortunately very disappointed! My bf had fish n'chips, that dish seemed ok. Waitress was basically non-existent. 

We tried again the very next morning to have breakfast, we both wish we would have gone somewhere else. I had eggs benedict, way over cooked, no runny yokes. My bf had steak & eggs - some much gristle throughout the meat. We both \"kinda\" had to eat our meals.... one because we were hungry & meals were pricy. Two because our waitress barely ever stopped by. Took forever to get some water, approx 10 & that's before we ever got to order! 

Won't come here again! It's unfortunate because it's always been our family favorite!"}
{"text":"I always order their nachos. I love the Volcano Nachos!!!!! My party said their food was great too. They had a taco salad, some shrimp in a garlic butter sauce and the crab dip. Back to the nachos: the portion is meant for sharing, maybe with 3 people. They put liquid & melted cheese on them I ordered them with chicken and no chili. So good!  I've been to this location a few times and other locations in different countries, always a great time, good service and good drinks!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Margaritaville several times and generally have a good experience. There is usually a wait to get in, and parking can be a pain. The food and drinks can be a bit expensive. 

The marquee item on the menu is the Volcano Nachos. It satisfied our table of six adults. The burgers are a pretty safe bet here. Drinks are pretty good here, but be careful how much you drink, because they add up. 

I really like the atmosphere here. I'm no die hard Parrot Head, but I appreciate Jimmy Buffett and it is neat seeing how this guy lives and the happiness he brings people. They seem to play more of his stuff for dinner than lunch."}
{"text":"Came in on Black Friday for lunch, I had the El Diablo burger and it was delicious. We had Heather Robinson as our server and she was on point with her suggestions not only from the menu but also from the bar. This was my first time here, and I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here for the nachos!! Read so much about them on here and they were good. Had real nacho cheese on them. I also ordered the taco salad which I loved the actual shell. It was delicious. Nice and soft flour tortilla. Our waitress was nice. My only complaint was my fiancé was setting next to me and we could barely hear each other over the loud music. Other then that if we ever come back to Vegas again we will deff stop by for the nachos!!"}
{"text":"Tourist trap.
-Prices are insane, $17.99 for meatless nachos, $9 for a beer.
-Nachos were disgusting.
-Beer was just OK.
-Nickle and dime for everything,  $2 for salsa, $5 for meat on nachos, Etc.
-Service left a lot to be desired.
-Excellent view of the strip for people watching.
-Interior looks like a typical chain restaurant.
I would not return, there are too many better options."}
{"text":"Margaritaville is what I would categorize as one and done. Meaning I have only gone there once and would never return.  The bartender got into a screaming match with a customer not cool and it made me feel very uncomfortable.  The bathrooms are disgusting and every surface in the entire bar seemed to be covered in some sort of sugary slime.  Margaritaville needs a hose down."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Wasn't expecting much but the mango margaritas were delicious, nachos were HUGE (one order is prob enough for 6-8 to share for an appetizer), cheeseburger was juicy/cheesy/toasty, and jambalaya was yum (not spicy but still good). 

Kudos for seating our party of 14 in around 25 minutes and not kicking us out when we got rowdy and one of us decided to moon half the restaurant :X."}
{"text":"My favorite Vegas spot to relax, have a good meal and some fantastic drinks, without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Definitely touristy and overpriced.  But, when I was visiting in the summer and it was 110 degrees outside and I was carrying my shopping bags, I stopped in for a refreshing frozen drink and, I gotta tell ya, it sure hit the spot.  I had the banana colada drink (the pina colada with some banana flavoring dumped in) and I did like it.  It was pretty sweet but it was so cold and the sun was so hot that I didn't mind.  I sat at the bar and the extremely friendly bartender kept giving me samples of other flavors, too, so that was a bonus.  

I only sat at the sidewalk bar and had no food but I had a nice time and enjoyed my drink.  Since it was pricey, I was leaning toward a 3 star rating but the bartender was so nice that I bumped it up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went here somewhat begrudgingly with my girlfriend when we were in Vegas and had a GREAT time here.  The signature drink ... uh, margaritas .. were really good.  Sure, they were pricey but whatever.  The food was delish, much better than other \"theme\" restaurants.  (I see you Hard Rock.)  We had the volcano sized nachos that were so big and delicious that I took a photo of my girlfriend with them and I now consider that a slice of heaven (nachos + girlfriend).  Plus, they made them non-vegetarian and when we asked to adjust (gf is vegetarian), they did easily.  We also ate (gorged) and had a sandwich with it.  And they had some sort of Vegas touristy entertainment with people being called up on stage.  I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"I would say this place is actually more like a 3 1/2 stars. I was pleasantly surprised with this place. First off the atmosphere here is party all the way. The decor is so totally cool with the Caribbean and nautical theme to the max. What a fun place to come. The service here is outstanding. Our waiter was very friendly and talkative. As he is local he was full of great information to our questions about town and such.

To our delight all 6 of us agreed that the food here was more and better than we expected. My shrimp and grits were excellent. One of the better versions I have had. Others had burgers, fajitas and chicken fingers and everyone said good things while we enjoyed the food. The drinks here were also good. The portions and prices were right on and we left here full and content.

I would definitely reccomend this place for a fun atmosphere and decent food with great service."}
{"text":"OK so I've read the reviews and I can't disagree but on the other hand I have to tell readers to remember why you are coming to MARGARITAVILLE...It's an experience people...You're not coming here for a meal because there is no where else to go...You're coming here because it's what it is...

Drinks are good...I've had better
Food is good...I've had better
Music is awesome...It's Buffett man cmon he is the best in concert I've seen him like ten times so coming to his restaurant is totally fun. 

When I come to Margaritaville I'm not coming to have a dining experience I usually come to show friends a fun time...visit the gift shop and listen to great music and watch the TV's. That is what MARGARITAVILLE is all about. If you want more than that it is going to disappoint.

If you want something really great though...The Nacho's will NOT disappoint they are yummy..."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review as I really wanted to like this place. I'm a Jimmy Buffett fan from when I was in college. I had to stop in here to check it out. So when we were hungry one night, we went in here. I now wish we hadn't. 

We were seated at a table, it was kind of dark, but that's okay. There was a band playing... loudly and it wasn't the type of music I figured would be in Margaritaville. I came here hoping for something Jimmy. I understand that they can't play all Jimmy all the time, but I was hoping as it was a weeknight to hear some, even if it was a cover band. 

Of course being the fan boy that I am, I had to get the Cheeseburger in Paradise. My wife got the filet. (I love a woman that eats steak!). Neither one of us was impressed with our meal. I thought the burger was kind of plain, even with the Heinz 57 on it (I admitted I was a fan boy!).  The burger was kind of dry and not very appetizing. It could have used... something.  My wife said her filet was the same, just kind of eh, okay. Definitely not worth the price we paid for it. 

The part that really killed this place for me was the service. We had the worst server of our vacation here. He was slow, didn't check up on us. Our drinks would go empty and we couldn't get refills. Even when we were finished we had to flag him down to come over to get a check, and then we had to wait to get that even longer. 

Jimmy, I'm still a fan... but I'm not going back to this Margaritaville again."}
{"text":"Long wait, as expected. Great music and fun atmosphere. Nice variety of food to choose from."}
{"text":"Went with my family for New Years Eve.  The drinks were weak and they left the doors open so we were freezing!  Overrated!  This location lacks a personality- it a cookie cutter version of Buffet's tropical locations.  On the plus side, the bar food was great but I wouldn't probably go back... Definitely not for New Years Eve!"}
{"text":"I am giving this two stars based on my first experience here, keep in mind we went during opening week, and we will be back when it is \"calmed down\" and I will give another honest update if it's any better.

At first walking in, it's beautiful, like you've stepped into an island resort, everything is so vibrant and \"beachy\". 

We went to the first bar located where the dining area is, there was a LONG wait. This is after trying to go to the rooftop which had a line to get in, they were at capacity so the line was taking forever, and they were only letting people in as someone came down, unfortunately we never made it up. Back to the bar, the waitress was TERRIBLY rude, she was arguing with a customer, and even after giving them their drink continued arguing with them as I was trying to order, and continued to stare them down as she was pouring my drinks, very off putting. 

Walking to the back bar, that has \"lounge\" seating and TVs, it's nice and open, a lot of places to sit, or dance, the whole place is very promising and i'm sure they are going to have growing pains. Attitude creates attitude so I would say the biggest issue is staff! Make sure they know what \"customer service\" is, you never know who you'll be serving and who is going to review you!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Mediocre service. Mediocre food. Mediocre atmosphere. This place is only here for people who drunkenly stumble in wanting big portions for a good price. The nacho plate was huuuuuge so I'll give them that but it was so average, a toddler could make it at home. The lava shrimp was way too spicy with no flavor at all. The chicken tenders were COLD which was the absolute deal breaker for me and they tried to cover it up by warming up the plate. NICE TRY, MARGARITAVILLE. Maaaaaaaybe I'll be back when I'm drunk af. Maybe. But not today."}
{"text":"We came here after a wedding to have a few drinks, unwind and listen to the live band.  It was pretty awesome that there was live music and no cover charge on a Saturday night.  I really hate paying cover so this immediately made me happy.  We were a rather large group and they were very accommodating in moving tables and chairs together so we could all sit as a group.  It was cool that they had a large dance floor and the live band would alternate playing with the DJ.  The band was pretty talented because at one point or another, everyone had a chance to be the lead singer.  They played a good mix of country, rock, rap, & pop.  They basically catered to a variety of musical tastes so you were bound to hear something that you would like.  

The drinks were kind of expensive.  It was $4.50 for a small plastic cup of Bud light, but I didn't mind since there was no cover to get in.  The service was slightly less than adequate since the waitress had already guaranteed her gratuity since we were a large party, she kind of just hid in the corner and ate her food.  I don't see why we would have to shell out nearly $40 for her, when she was in the corner talking to her friend and eating most of the night.  I had to get up and tap her on the shoulder to order more drinks.  Overall, the service could have been a little bit better, but I had fun and have no real complaints."}
{"text":"Guess what?  I'm a tourist.  I love the tourist traps.  Especially if they serve gianormous cylinders of margaritas and nachos that are piled high with the likes of sour cream and guacamole and cheese and, oh, who the hell cares, we're drunk, bring it on.

We were escorted to our tables in under 5 minutes.  WIN.

Boat races with said margaritas = one of the best decisions we collectively made all day.  WIN.

View of the strip from the upstairs balcony.  WIN

It was a day of win.  Pretty much the only winning I did in Las Vegas all weekend..."}
{"text":"Expensive drinks.  Loud.  Themed.  Kinda gross.  

My real problem with this place is that they do not let you sleep on the floor of the patio, and sometimes when you're in Vegas, that's really all you need.  Not a long nap, but just 3 minutes - power nap.  But no, not at Jimmy Buffet's.  Within seconds there is a team of security around you asking you to take it elsewhere.  

Who wants to go somewhere like that?  Not me."}
{"text":"We didn't actually eat here, but we stopped by for a few drinks while walking along the strip. It was fun. Especially if you're a jimmy fan or a fan of island themes. Decorations are nice and drinks are priced well for Vegas. Good atmosphere and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"We decided on Margaritaville since the Yardhouse was a 45 minute wait and we were heading to the hockey game on Valentines Day. There was not a wait at Margaritaville, no longer wondering why. The service was terrible and the food quality is very poor. We probably would have spent less and had better service and received the same quality food as Burger King. The food clearly tastes like it came off the Sysco truck and was merely heated up in their kitchen. We also waited 40 minutes for our food and had to flag down a manager just to get our check. Ordered 2 iced teas for $6??? Boring food and boring service, will not return unfortunately."}
{"text":"The staff was great to deal with.  David was a great server.  It is nice they don't treat everybody like tourists even though we are!"}
{"text":"Fucking love this place. Everything is good...especially the nachos and loaded land shark."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times since it opened. It has always been good, but the new has definitely worn off. At first, it was fun checking out all the decorations, the boat booths, the volcano, etc. While I still think the food is good, I'd like to see them change up the menu or add to it. I'm sure they've made some changes, but it's hardly noticeable. I had a pulled pork sandwich this time which I've had before. They now serve it open faced and put two onion rings on it. The onion rings were great, but it's still the same sandwich. This seems to be the way they've changed things up. I'm not positive, but I think I remember the drinks coming in actual glasses instead of the plastic cups they were served in on this visit. I can understand that sometimes drunks shouldn't be given glass, but at this particular time, I didn't see any reason to think that the crowd would get out of hand, and I hate drinking out of plastic cups. It's not a keg party. I'm sure they can do plenty of business with only first time customers, but I'm running out of reasons to come back when there are new restaurants opening in Vegas every week. The food doesn't stand out enough to keep people returning, it's the theme. I guess it's still better than many of the other casual dining tourist traps on the strip. I AM a Jimmy Buffett fan, and Margaritaville is a great brand. I have been to and enjoyed their restaurants in many cities. I just hope it doesn't get too stale like a Hard Rock Cafe or Planet Hollywood restaurant. Obviously in Vegas, it's much more difficult to keep up with all the competition."}
{"text":"We never felt like waiting in line for dinner.. but it was convienient for a quick breakfast stop ... Mostly just omlets, and I think they were about 12-13 bucks a peice... but we sat on the 3rd floor overlooking the strip and Ceaser's... 

They were GIANT omlets though, both of us only finished half.  Maybe they should make half portions.. or next time maybe we'll share one!  I hate wasting food .. especially if i'm paying 12 bucks for a couple eggs... :)"}
{"text":"This is a lot of food!  My friends were raving about this place and how much they liked it and how affordable it was last time they were here and it really was pretty good.  I had the fish tacos and one of my friends had the seafood mac and cheese and she was CRAZY about it!  It was a little bit pricier than I would have liked but it's Vegas, I didn't expect cheap.  I mean, honestly, for how much I paid, I expected something a little bit more tasty but it wasn't bad.  Just a little bland but maybe I should just stay away from the fish tacos next time."}
{"text":"It was alright I guess. We started one of our evenings here before heading out to more exciting places. It took FOREVER to get a drink at the bar. Although there really wasn't any line, the 4 bartenders were more interested in talking to each other and restocking the bar then taking drink orders. The drinks were reasonably priced and tasted good. We didn't have to wait to get a table thankfully but we did get the very last one. The dance floor had a decent amount of people out on it. I think tacky is too strong a word to describe them but let's just say they were very casually dressed and touristy. It's also the only club I saw in vegas the whole time I was down there where most of the men were sagging their pants and showing off their drawers. We left after the first drink and shot to find something better."}
{"text":"Got in early in the morning and checked in over at the Mirage across the street 2016 Superbowl weekend. We walked over the Margaritaville and grabbed a table just as they opened. We had to wait a bit to get seated , but no big deal. The place was decorated very nice and had a huge plane hanging from the ceiling. The service was pretty attentive and got our food and drinks out pretty quick. I ordered two really good margaritas and some fish tacos. The tacos were spot on good. Overall I would come back next time in Vegas, no complaints."}
{"text":"Bartenders were awesome, had a great time here. Stood outside watching people walk up and down the main strip. Never had trouble getting a drink, good music and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Margarittaville - but not for the food.

The drinks are great, although super overpriced (but what drink isn't overpriced in Vegas?) but the food is below average. I had the wings one time - yuck. The next time I had the Volcano nachos. Those were actually okay but a TON of food. Get those for like 4 people, not as an entree for one haha. 

But what I love most about this place is the atmosphere! I've been here twice and we've sat on the upstairs patio both times. Once at night and once during lunch. It's absolutely beautiful at both day and night and you can here all the noise from the strip - it's lovely. I'll eat here again but only because I love the drinks and the view from that patio is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Margaritaville was exactly as expected. There are kitchy acts going on that keep the energy up and there is always something to look at while you are eating. The food was good - not great - but solid. It was especially good after a long night of drinking. I didn't order any drinks but I did get an appetizer and a burger. Both were very tasty. But even now that I am thinking back on the meal I can't remember exactly what I ate. Not a good sign! But I do remember being full and happy when I left. The only downside is that our final bill came to over $50 and for two burgers, an app and no drinks, that was pretty crazy. I get that it's Las Vegas, but still, I was surprised! I would like to go back and try the drinks and see if they live up to the hype!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the flats. Tropical escape in the heart of Cleveland. Will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"They made us wait over a hour and a half just to be seated for a party of 4. After we told the manager what was up, she got us a table. We had to wait another 30 minutes just to be seen from our waiter, the male waiter seemed a little annoyed of us because we asked him for separate checks. My friend and I order the sirloin steak and asked for it to be cooked medium rare and when it came out one was burnt and all fat and the other burnt outside and very raw in the inside. The salad which was included with meal was very bland and had no taste, the only good thing was the mashed potatoes and the green beans. It was my first time in Vegas and was expecting more from the tourists attractions. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody that I know. This was really a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Service was so slow ! It was lunch hour and hardly that busy. I order the catch of the day ,  and high came out all broken apart and looked like it had been shredded. The bill was $75.00 for lunch !!!!!! On another note the appetizer trio my husband liked and the margaritas were delicious. 
I would go here for happy hour and appetizers !!!"}
{"text":"We cannot even talk to each other bc the music is insanely loud. Asked already 2 times to please lower it bc with very few people in here it is blaring so loud.....and no relief. Don't even know how the food is but I can tell you that we won't be back....ever.
.............We ate now so I wanted to leave a review of the food. Overpriced and bare basic. Overpriced vegetarian menu and extremely limited. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place lobster nachos and a 5 o'clock somewhere drink is a perfect way to start your night out before you hit the clubs the whole vibe of this place is just fun I will continue to come here every time I visit Vegas"}
{"text":"Great food, great service...lots of fun.  The entertainment for the night was a little strange, but amusing.  They did raffle drawings and it was just a fun environment.  The drinks were very good too!"}
{"text":"The ambiance here is true to the laid back style of Jimmy Buffett, with a mix of island style entertainment. Service was excellent, food was just OK. Really enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited Margaritaville for the first time for my first visit to Vegas last year. Highly dissapointed!

Not very good service, took 15min to get a waiter to our table. Ordered appetizer which was the best part of our experience. I ordered Fish and Chips, tasted like it came straight from the freezer, horrible. Basically I left hungry and upset. No one wants to be upset in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food her is great and at a nice price. I was full in no time. The music I felt like I was on the beach. We were seated in the back of a boat which was cute. The yard size drink was great. 

If your wanting a burger and to chill out this is a great location to do it.

Best part this is right smack in the middle of the strip across from Caesar's Palace you can't miss it.

Have a burger and a beer and enjoy."}
{"text":"As a major Parrothead I really like the Glendale property.  I'm clueless to why Jimmy choose this location as it's always empty!  I hope business can pick up for them so they stick around.  Staff are friendly and provide a good time with the same menu standard across the chain.

You can never go wrong with the Cheeseburger, of course, but there are a lot of great other options.  Shrimp, ahi, nachos, are all quite nice.  The fajitas are not that great, but that's okay.  It's really the experience you are there for in the first place.

I always recommend the \"Perfect Margarita\", why waste time, it's Perfect!"}
{"text":"As a major Parrothead I love coming to Vegas as it's usually for a concert.  A large venue that's well done, even better with the new stret bar allowing breeze and more views.  Staff are friendly and provide a good time with the same menu standard across the chain.

{"text":"I give the lunch a five star because of Sean, our waiter.  I am going on a limb, but would say this is the best waiter I have ever had.  He was very attentive and made sure that we were good.  In Vegas, I can find people to be numb to good service.  He went above and beyond."}
{"text":"I'm from Cleveland, so when visiting home I was beyond excited to see how much the East bank has been revitalized.  Good on ya Cleveland!!! 

But... Mom really really wanted to go to Margaritaville, so despite the 1.5 hour wait (beautiful day, we can stroll around) we put our names on the list.  

The Good

Staff very friendly, very accommodating.  Best thing about the place, truly. 
Great views from the rooftop. 

The Bad

Noise level from music so high we had to shout to hear each other in the restaurant. Extremely  annoying. This alone will keep me away from a joint. 

Food was Applebees quality level. I don't mind simple fare, but land sakes Mr. Buffet, you would not be eating here unless you were baked.   Prices were very high for what you get.  I ordered the jambalaya and it was $19.  Taste was ok but nothing special and looked like it had been slopped into a bowl. No bread, no chips and salsa (you had to order the Nacho Mtn or something).   My husbands fajita was as bland as toast.  We do live in Texas so maybe that's an Ohio thing, but hey, let people complain the food is too delicious before dialing it back to zero.   Margarita was ok but gone in two gulps.  It's Margaritaville for crying out loud!

The Ugly

Stop taking advantage of good, hard working people with this over-capitalization on a celebrity name.  Charge more if you want but at least give the people their money's worth!    Grrrr. Makes me mad.  I stopped writing this bad review in my head after the third $10 marg kicked in, but it came back after I sobered up.   Wake up Cleveland, forget this place and support a local business instead."}
{"text":"Margaritaville is the Jimmy Buffet entry for Vegas.  Seems like a nice enough party joint, but get ready for a bunch of fried foods and some just \"OK\" margaritas. 

I was recently stationed there for a private party, which had it's own place on the very cold deck and a private bartender.  So bad and good things going for it.  

I would say the food is ok and the drinks are ok, but you can find much better throughout Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we've been here, went for dinner the 1st time, did lunch the 2nd time. The clipper wings are really good. My wife and I both had cheeseburgers that are among the best I've ever had. The atmopshere is great, any Buffett fan would love this place. Our bill was decent, $50 for drinks, appetizers and entrees. The nachos are awesome too."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to get some lunch here. It was my first time coming here and love how they decorated the restaurant. It kind of reminded me of rainforest cafe. My friend and I decided to split the nachos and we ate maybe a quarter of it. It was ginormous and delish!! Their drinks were fruity and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Did we really come here? Twice? Yikes.

 It's kind of a kitschy place. We just wanted margaritas! The wild berry colada was really good (I got pretty lucky with my drinks of choice on this Vegas trip). Someone else got \"the perfect margarita\", which was literally all hard liquor. Oops. Good thing he ate a whole carb-heavy pizza by himself for lunch.

The 2nd time we came here, we ordered 2 Volcano Nachos - it was way too much even as entrees. It wasn't as appetizing towards the end, or even the middle. Fajitas were meh. I didn't expect much in terms of food. 

They loop clips on a projected screen of people getting sloshed somewhere on vacation. Who actually wears hawaiian shirts and leis at Margaritaville?"}
{"text":"You guys are such liars. 3.5 stars!? Clearly you made some terrible menu decisions. Let me help you out: order the damn pretzel sticks. You're welcome. 

How great would it have been if I just ended my review there? Chances are you're probably buzzed or wasted so whatever. Congratulations if you're still reading! 

Margaritaville was located very close to our hotel so we stopped in for a bite (who really wants to walk around in 100 degree heat looking for a place to eat?). We were seated right away by a friendly hostess. Our waitress came by soon after. 

I ordered a fish sandwich with sweet potato fries - there was so much food I couldn't finish my plate. I didn't even eat the bun (yeah, I was THAT girl. What about it? #carbproblems)

My friend ordered a burger, which she said was really good. My other friend ordered a taco salad, which she could not stop raving about. 

The food was great, the service was fast, and...those damn pretzels were stupid good.  

I have zero complaints (except that the plate should have more pretzels...). 

Ps: If you're complaining about tackiness, I just want to point out that Vegas is a giant strip of tacky built in the middle of a desert."}
{"text":"Second time at this location. First time was way over a couple of years ago.
Margaritas weren't bad. The watermelon one was pretty  good .Definitely not weak.
Our group sat at the bar and all I can say is our bartender looked so miserable.
He was unfriendly and we even commented it to him too and told him to smile .
At least fake it.
Lastly, the place had a bad smell throughout and just seemed to be looking run down."}
{"text":"I use to love goin to this place on vacations but my last time I went November 2015. It was not so good the lady at the front seat totally ignores us while talking to her friends (staff) we were literally right in front of her to get a see and a family walks up and she said hi how are you guys how many. I obviously got annoyed went up to a different host and they sat us I told him about the situation he said oh that happens with her all the time.And she can't get fired because of some Union thing.he said he'd get a manger they never came the whole time it was just a bad experience"}
{"text":"My wife and I made a stop at our usual eatery during our Vegas visit and Margaritaville has NEVER let us down.  We love this place, the food is beyond great, the service is always on the mark and the environment is the best!!!  We ordered the Volcano Nachos for the 1st time on this recent visit and were a little disappointed because they were pretty dry but we told our server and he immediately took them back and wrote them off our bill, not a problem at all.  The wings are amazing  as well as the rest of their food."}
{"text":"I keep coming back! The 5 o'Clock somewhere Margherita is Excellent! And the drink making performance by Shawn is FUN!"}
{"text":"Below average.  Not terrible but I was looking forward to coming here and it was disappointing.  Our table got 2 lots of the volcano nachos and a burger.  The nachos went to slop after about 5 minutes and had little flavour (they looked good though).  The size of this dish can definitely be shared.  On the positive side it's got a good vibe and the cocktails were very good.  We had a incommunicado and a margarita and cannot fault them."}
{"text":"How on earth did I end up here at some ridiculous hour of the morning? And why were masses of people attempting to dance to Enter Sandman by Metallica played by some cover band? Who were those sleazy older men sitting in that fake boat-booth drinking all that crap? Wait - were those real Marines in uniform trying to score some action on the fake wooden pier? It was like a dream. It was too much. I had to leave. So I did.  

This place is not a destination for your night - or it shouldn't be anyway. Margarittaville is where you end up when you didn't have a plan, you get washed up in the tide of 'go with the flow' then you hit yourself on the head and say, 'what the HELL?' and leave as fast as you can."}
{"text":"Came for drinks and sat with Jon at the bar.  What great service and he and kala kept us entertained the whole time!! Keep up the great work, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Want a great breakfast/hangover cure? Get the steak and eggs. For less than $15 you'll have a mound of hash browns, eggs, steak, and toast. 

Fun atmosphere. Good drinks. Friendly waitstaff. Reasonable prices for the Strip."}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot for drinks on the Strip! The Perfect Margarita is truly perfect (and this is coming from a Texan).  The house margarita is a little sweet and weak, so pay the extra couple bucks and get the Perfect.  The Loaded Landshark is good too.  

 The food is nothing remarkable, and actually my veggie burger was just plain gross.  But the nachos were tasty, and everyone else's salads and sandwiches were fine.  We only had one meal here but came back almost every day for a drink.  Service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere is fun.  Definitely worth stopping in while you're in town!"}
{"text":"Eh... Its really cool looking, food is good, a little over priced.. Crappy happy hour.. Its an okay experience.. Waitress was a little overwhelmed and not so happy.. I probably wouldn't go back for there $10 little margaritas.. They weren't bad but I wasn't impressed.."}
{"text":"Slow service bad attitude. Go somewhere else. These people suck. The drunks aren't strong and the woman who is our server isn't good at what she does. I award them no points, may go have mercy on their souls."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I don't get it.  Why do people think Margaritaville is cool?  It's not.  It is a chain that plays predictable music.  People yap on about the atmosphere, but Hawaiian shirts and pretending like we're on vacation isn't a very hard concept to come up with.

I haven't been forced to eat at this location yet (and am hoping to avoid it with all that I can) but I have drank here a few times.  It is almost always busy on weekend evenings and there is a live band on those evenings.  The live band does play a random mix of musical genres on the weekend, which is nice because I might go insane if I had to hear all that Buffet nonsense all night long.

Drinking here is expensive.  Nothing is ever on special and the bartenders don't know how to make drinks that taste good.  The other night I was craving a long island so I indulged myself.  The drink was horrendous- it taste like a vat of sour mix.  My friend said to me \"I never order anything but beer here for just that reason\" and it all made sense to me.  I also recall ordering a round of shots on one occasion that were probably half of a regular shot glass and $8 a piece.  Insane.  

I realize that there are often lines at the other, better choices in Westgate if you arrive too late on a Friday or Saturday night, so unless you are in love with this whole ridiculous Margaritaville concept, get to Westgate earlier!"}
{"text":"I LOVED LOVED LOVED this place.  I would have not minded just hanging out here every night during our 3 night stay.  I had a banana margarita and it was wonderful.  Hubby and I shared the yummy volcano nachos and didnt even put a dent in them.  The atmoshpere is so fun.  You cant help but to have a good time here!  GO!!!"}
{"text":"The wait is over on the East Bank of the Flats!  After a few months of delays you can now sit on the rooftop deck and drink a Landshark beer, or maybe not!  I know it's only the second day and there are always kinks to work out in a new restaurant but when I sat down and my son and I ordered a Landshark beer, the waitress informed us that they were out of both the draft and bottles of their signature beer.  We arrived a little after 11 am today so how does a restaurant run out of their signature beer right after opening on the second day?

The staff was nice and the atmosphere was good.  There seemed to be ample seating with two bars on the first floor and an outdoor patio on the rooftop with a nice view of the Flats.  Having been to the Margaritaville in both Myrtle Beach and Panama City, I was surprised that they did not have the passing thunderstorm where the tequila bottle came down out of the \"sky\" with the lights dimming and the thunder roaring over the house speakers.  Nor did they have any staff members singing the famous Margaritaville with the crowd shouting, \"Salt, salt, salt!\" 

The food was okay and a tad bit over priced.  Started with the \"Volcano Nachos\" which are a must and I was pleased with them.  I ordered the $14.00 \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" (medium well) and it came out pink, the bun was soggy and the patty did not have much flavor.  My son ordered the $22.00 sirloin steak (medium well) and it came out pink as well.  It wasn't a large cut of meat and it came with one scoop of mashed potatoes and some green beans.  It seems this new kitchen staff has some work ahead.

I'm glad that this restaurant made it to the East Bank of the Flats in Cleveland but my experience today was nothing to cheer about."}
{"text":"In Vegas with a planned trip of over a month and one thing you look forward to is a really refreshing margarita from MargaritaVill yet showed up and was highly disappointed. From the bar tender to the actual drink it was not the experience or the taste expected."}
{"text":"This place has 2 levels to it. They were so busy we had to wait 20 minutes for a table...yet I don't think the second floor was even open.

But Katliyn our server was wonderful. We sat in what looked like a speed boat. The seats were a little dirty upon arrival.  We had perfect margaritas & the chocolate hurricane."}
{"text":"Pros: Fun atmosphere and decor, Jeff D was a fantastic server.

Cons/Average: Food. We had chips & salsa, veggie burger with sweet potato fries, and tacos. They weren't terrible, but they weren't spectacular either.

If you're going out to eat for good quality food rather than a fun experience, probably best to skip this place."}
{"text":"If you like food poisoning from conch fritters, then this is 100% the place for you.

This is dedicated to Jessica, who has a slower metabolism than I do and thought I was just drunk but spent the entire next day barfing her brains out while I puked it all out starting at 3 am - 3 pm the next day."}
{"text":"While on my own little Vegas vacation, my family and I passed this awesome little spot on the strip, and I just HAD to check it out.  Being a huge fan of the beverage perfection that is the margarita, I dragged my family in.

There was a small wait during midday Tuesday (about 15 min), but the waiting area was comfortable and air conditioned, and the staff was very friendly overall.  I started off with their \"Perfect Margarita\", which consisted of both gold and silver margaritaville tequila (which I guess was to be expected considering it's Jimmy Buffet's own brand), and it was one of the better restaurant made margaritas that I've had recently.

As an appetizer, the 4 of us split an order of conch fritters (6), which were very tasty.  It would have been very easy to eat the whole appetizer solo, but I'm glad I didn't, because I definitely wanted room for the main course.

My main dish was Jamaican Jerk Shrimp and pasta, which came with a creme sauce that was spicy, but not overbearingly so.  The shrimp were large, and there was a good amount of them, as well.  I couldn't help but finish the whole plate off, the entree was so good I could have licked my plate clean if I wasn't in public.  My sister got the king crab and shrimp salad, and though I only tasted a small portion of it, I was impressed, and would order it the next time."}
{"text":"Been going to Vegas for eons. Always was amazed we never tried Margaritaville. Finally went for Sunday breakfast. Right off, the first person you meet usually sets the tone. This hostess so did not want to be there or had something going on and it showed. Me \" Morning, table for two please\"... Hostess \"10 to 15 minutes as handing over a buzzer. no greeting, no smile, nothing other than that. Okay then Well, I guess we are waiting.  

The server was quite good actually. Prompt and nice enough. Just the food brought it back down. Quickly, do not try the great sounding Avocado/Boursin omelet. It is nasty. The eggs seemed and tasted like powdered. Way too much Boursin (Maybe to hide the eggs:) A wee bit of avocado.  We both had hash browns, I got about 1/4 cup serving if that and he got at least a cup worth. Very inconsistent. We asked for both crispy. His were not in the least, most were not even somewhat browned just a heap of undercooked white strips and mine were mostly burnt. Burned is not what crispy means lol. Usually, I'll try a place twice, because everyone and place can have a bad day... there were just too many strikes and there are just too many options in Vegas. Not again."}
{"text":"Best part of this place, the patio that overlooks the strip. You can get your drunk on, yes, drunk on, and wave to the ladies, gentlemen, and others walking/driving up and down the strip. The food, was Meh. It was like a step lower than Denny's. We ordered some shrimp (cold dish) and for some reason, we thought it was going to be hot? The drinks are better, but food, ugh. I'd rather hit up a buffet. This is more of the place to buy the drinks then to come for the food. Our waitress also managed to lose my friend's debt card for 20 minutes. Oh, the evening we went, the men's Hooters team was here? WTF? I didn't know they existed."}
{"text":"Cheesefest, USA. 
Food was okay, but definitely nothin to write home about. Kitchy, touristy, cross between joe's crab shack and freecreditreport.com commercial. The namesake \"show\" was lame, complete with stilt walkers and bikini clad chick, but if you're wasted, it might be funny. Long waits also dampen the fun. Mango margs are tops, bahama mama is yum and the nachos were tasty, everything else is typical overpriced fare."}
{"text":"Much better quality food than I expected for the prices.  This place is a great value compared with most of the options on the strip.  The service was also pretty good considering how busy it was.  I will likely stop in again next time I am in Vegas.  Good selection of beers too, it's the only place in Vegas I saw PBR on tap!"}
{"text":"Super hungry.. the three of  us shared VOLCANO NACHOS and wings and omg.. I was ready for bed...

So good!"}
{"text":"Went to check the place out on a Monday night (7/31) thinking we might be avoiding a super busy night.  We were able to have a few cold ones at the outside bar.   Service there was superb!   We decided against eating at the bar so put our name on list with the server to sit outside.  Told it would be 30-60 minute wait.  Turned out to be over an hour.  

We did have a new server, very friendly and rather efficient.  Unfortunately the spinach strawberry salad I had eyed on the menu earlier was not an option because they were out of the vinaigrette dressing.  Opted to not replace with Italian or ranch.  Disappointing!   Sandwiches we ordered took FOREVER!   And sadly they really were just okay.  Pricey for sure... and then not wowed by our meal.  

The restaurant is decorated very festive and definitely a fun Margaritaville environment.  The place is huge!!  Almost too big.  We didn't head up to the rooftop Landshark Bar.  Next time when we're out and about for cocktails.  

Unfortunately there was an incident in the hallway between the kitchen (that is soooo far away from the dining areas) and the restrooms and access to rooftop bar.  Someone had vomited in the middle of the intersecting hallways so there really wasn't any way around it to totally avoid.  That being said... things happen.  The problem was that it wasn't IMMEDIATELY cleaned up or blocked off.  Absolutely unacceptable!!!  

Fun place to go for drinks for sure.  But I do hope they get the kinks out for seating and certainly in the kitchen to serve meals a  bit quicker.  Big restaurant, big kitchen... should be more efficient."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here yesterday and we were pleased. We weren't really that hungry, but we felt like eating something small. I ordered the lava shrimp, it was spicy, but really tasty. My husband is a quesadilla lover, so of course, he ordered the quesadilla. He liked his food as well. I ordered a strawberry ice cream to go for while we were walking back to our car, and I think I just found my new favorite ice cream place. it was so good, real strawberries in it made it even better :) 

I was really considering getting one of their frozen drinks, but it was way too hot yesterday to drink, but next time I'm around there, I'll be sure to get a girly drink :) Hopefully it wont be so hot out so I don't get dehydrated quickly ;)"}
{"text":"Went here April 13, 2013 during the day....It was so much fun! Our server did a great job. We asked him what was the best drink to get and he said the \"Perfect Margarita\"....and it was perfect....all alcohol and some lime juice. WOW. Loved the music, the atmosphere, and the nachos.

 One of the best parts ( and after drinking 2 Perfect margaritas) was going outside on the balcony and high-fiving people walking by. hahah...."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast on the Strip!  Not impressed with dinner though.  

So to be positive, let me tell you about breakfast.  I LOVE to go to any Margarittaville I come across on my travels, if for nothing else but to have a drink and collect a glass.  If the particular menu looks good, we will eat as well.  I was surprised to find out that the Vegas location is open for breakfast - AWESOME!  We started the day, Vegas-Style with orange juice, sugar free red bull and vodka in a souvenir glass - yeah baby.  If that's isn't the way to start your day then what is? LOL  The food that followed was very good for breakfast food at a chain...I had steel cut oatmeal with fresh veggies.  Hubby had an omelet of some type with wheat toast.  We were pleased and will go back for breakfast  again next time in Vegas.

However, dinner was below average in taste and pricey for \"bar food\".  Too crowded and service was below par."}
{"text":"I have to state up-front that I am, in fact, an official dues-paying, card-carrying Parrothead. That said, I was a bit disappointed in this Margaritaville. The decor is awesome and our waiter was nice and accommodating...and that's about all I can say that's positive. Everything is overpriced. Our conch fritters were burned. My brother had a salad with chicken that he found rubbery, although our waiter graciously brought him more. It  was a $12 salad at best, but they charged $17, of course. My surf 'n' turf was very good and my steak WAS cooked rarerarerare like I prefer, but it too was rather overpriced ($28, with the \"turf\" being coconut shrimp). 

As someone else pointed out, I heard only one Jimmy song the whole time! A band was setting up towards the end of our visit, but while the video screens continued to show videos, no music was heard. Major bummer. The attached store was fun, though, and that was really the reason I went, so that was good. 

If I lived in the Phoenix area, I might come here once in a while to shop and have a drink, but the food leaves a lot to be desired. Sorry, Jimmy! I still love ya though. FINS UP!"}
{"text":"First clue was a no trespassing sign posted INSIDE the restaurant and then stated wait for served. We (party of 4) had to check in with the front counter then see a hostess then got our table. We received our Menus. It was not busy what so ever and we seen everyone else get service as we looked at the menu. Not once did we receive any contact from anyone. I observed the same waitress walk by us 6 times! So after waiting a total of 20 minutes from when we walked to our table and not receive a second of service, we walked out. No one attempted to contact us and as we walked out, we observed 4 young female employees all huddled like they were on break and laughing while they stared at the same phone. Now let's talk about the menu, very limited and over priced food we can find at smiths. We ended up going to the yard house and not only was seated right away but had our drinks with in 5 minutes. (Not drink order but we're actually drinking). We tipped her $30 because of how awesome she was. So is this how you promote your locals knowing we went out of our way to go to the strip and paid for parking?
Thanks but no thanks, I'll recommend else where for our out of state and out of country family and friends"}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere. This place is huge! There were no seats outside, but we were told there was a rooftop bar. So we made our way to the back of the building and up two flights of stairs to grab the last clean table out there. 
Our waitress immediately greeted us with a smile and very friendly/upbeat attitude. She made drink suggestions and told us her favorites and the most popular. The drinks are much smaller then what is show on the menu, but they were good.
The food is very pricy, especially for a quick afternoon lunch. Nothing below $12.99 with burgers at w whopping $14.99.
My biggest complaint in most of my reviews is a restaurants inability to cook my meat to the correct temperature. I ordered a burger medium rare and it came out beyond well done. I would have said something to the waitress, but the only time she retuned to our table was after our meal was finished and asked if I wanted a box. She was nice enough not to charge me for the meal, so I filled up on French fries and booze....not the best combo. 
I totally understand being busy, I really do, but to not return to even ask how the food is, really disappointed me. 
Overall, I will probably return for a drink or two, but the food was not even \"ok\" for the price they wanted us to pay."}
{"text":"It's hard to write a review for this place considering my friend and I were here for 1 minute before we were rudely shoed out. We came for drinks and the hostess said we could find at the bar. The bar was empty with the exception for 4-5 people sitting on stools. There were no more seats so we kindly asked a couple at a high top table if we could borrow their stools and bring them to the bar to sit down. The second we brought them to the bar to sit down, an employee rudely ran over to us and practically yanked the chairs from under us saying that \"those chairs can't be at the bar\". He immediately put them back at the table and my friend and I just stood there confused and upset. He walked away and we (still standing at the bar) weren't sure what to do. The bartender stared at us and we walked out, clearly pissed, and not one employee looked at us. An absolutely horrible experience and I will make sure myself and anyone I know will never give this place a try again."}
{"text":"Sorry but this place didn't really live up to the hype.   Although they had a great live band playing called Sunset Harmony.  Will definitely look where else they're playing. 
The food was just your normal chain entrees, fries came out cold, they replaced them fairly quickly.  Overall the experience just wasn't great.  Very long time for our food to come out as well."}
{"text":"I loved the Macaw chairs. Thought they were beautiful !! 

The food was small portions. My Margarita was the smallest watered down drink I've ever had! They had a bad was nice. Good band but was very loud. Came in for an early dinner from a college event. 

I did buy my hubby a gift at the gift shop. But we won't go back."}
{"text":"I came in for a girls night... there was a live DJ and a dance floor you can tell that people were reallt enjoying their time. There is a nice patio and bar for smoking. Although, we couldn't get drinks from the bar outside because he was closing down the guy was real polite. Inside there is a sit down bar. I ordered a Vodka cranberry and I did not taste the vodka at all. It tasted like store bought old cranberry. 

My friend she ordered a freeze Margaritas which tastes real good. The bartenders were standing around talking to each other and texting on their phones. 

The security was very nice and helpful. Not over the top but just right. The bathrooms were clean. The staff at the door was very friendly as well as inside."}
{"text":"The atmosphere helps give a 2 star review.. We came for breakfast, arrived around 9:30am and were told a 20min wait for the four of us. Mind you, more than half the restaurant is empty. Tons of people were waiting to be seated... However, we were patient. We didn't get seated till nearly 10:15am. Breakfast ends at 11am.. We were finally sat down, waited 10mins for the waitress. Took our drinks, waited again. Thought we wouldn't get breakfast by the time she came back. Finally ordered our food.. Didn't get served until 11:10am. The person who brought the food slammed our plates on the table. My food nearly slid off the plate to the table. Didn't get an apology. Two of the other plates had wrong items. We swapped them between ourselves. The waitress never came back till we finished eating. Food was okay, definitely won't come back. Irritating experience all around.

Edit - knocked another star off the review. Our bill wasn't split correctly. Had to have her fix it. We were over charged for our meals. Check the pricing when you order and compare it to your bill later. She dropped off the new bills for us and then came back less than 3mins later asking if we were set to go. Uhm. No. We needed more time. $40 for two below average breakfasts.. No thanks.

Edit - AGAIN, didn't bring me my change back. This place has gone down hill."}
{"text":"The nachos were HUGE they were pretty good. The margaritas are really good and have a nice kick."}
{"text":"My husband and I got married in May, 2013 at the Garden Gazebo at the Flamingo Hotel, immediately followed by a three hour wedding reception at Margaritaville. We reserved the Clipper Room, which is an enclosed space with it's own bar, restrooms and a balcony, and has a $6000 minimum, which we easily surpassed with our 75 guests. Margaritaville offered many different dinner options, included both plated and buffet, but we chose to go with the buffet. Our original coordinator, Sara Ure, met with us a few months before, but was unavailable the week of the wedding, so Beth Wamsley had to pick up the whole thing, and she did an awesome job! Our manager on duty the night of the reception was Bryan, and he was fabulous! We had multiple guests take a moment to tell us how amazing the service was during our reception. Overall, wonderful. 

For those brides to be looking for details: We got the a la carte buffet (pay per person, per dish, for example the mashed potatoes were $3/person), everything we choose was so delicious - apps were the baked apricot brie (so many compliments), and bacon wrapped shrimp. Dinner was tri tip (perfect, delicious), Caesar salad, chicken and artichoke pasta, mashed potatoes, steamed veggies. For dessert we chose a selection from the a la carte desserts - brownies, fruit tarts, chocolate mousse. It was all awesome. Overall I believe with food, tax, service charge for 75  guests we paid about $8,000. 

They can do different table arrangements in the Clipper Room, and they will put table numbers on the tables for you. You can bring in your seating chart or  board the day before the wedding, and they will put it up for you on a table or easel - so, so helpful, thanks again to Beth for doing that! They will also set up a speaker and microphone for people to give speeches, if you want. We had the system ready to go, but since the music was playing and we don't like speeches much, anyway, we skipped it."}
{"text":"Try the Perfect Margarita, it's about $13 but it is quite delicious. The atmosphere of this place is cool, it's right on the strip on the heart of all the craziness. Definitely check it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Ehh....   it's not all that to be honest.

The food is okay, and the atmosphere is so-so compared to other places you could be on the Strip.   The service is great, but on the Strip, you really shouldn't lack in service at all considering the whole place is a hospitality joint.

Typical Margaritaville.  Basically you've been to one, you've been to them all and they're not all that.   If you're a fan of Buffett, and have a desire to visit every one of his restaurants, then I would venture in, but otherwise, it's ehh.

meh.

yup."}
{"text":"Great view of the strip from the rooftop bar and dining.  MUST GET the nachos!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to pay no cover, dress casual, and get really drunk on The Strip, then this is the place for you.

On our first night in Vegas we didn't have big plans, especially since some of our group was coming from work, so we decided to have a chill, yet drunken, night out. Margaritaville was the perfect spot for this and catered to everyone in our group. 

Margaritaville is a huge, spacious, restaurant and bar. There is a huge dance floor and a stage for the band - who were playing some typical bar music - lots of Journey and 80's music. We found a table and ordered a round of kamikazi's and a couple daquiris, which altogether cost about $80 - still pretty expensive even though it's a casual bar, but hey it's Vegas. 

This is a fun place to start the night out but by no means is it the destination. I love bars just as much as the next person, but there wasn't anything about this place that wow'd me enough to come back. Did the job, though!"}
{"text":"Went here several times over the four day stay at the Flamingo Hotel. Very beachy themed,  it smells like copper tone upon entry.  Its a Jimmy Buffet themed Casino Bar,  boutique and Restaurant. At the Casino bar they do a $5 select drink happy hour from 2am to 10am. You can play video poker,  and have a drink.  Happy Hour and well drinks comp if you play video poker at the bar with a max bet. 
The food at the restaurant is amazing.  My friend got Volcano Nachos.  Delicious.  Just all the stuff is piled on the top and sides.  But awesome and huge.  
I had the buttermilk chicken which was a tasty southern fried dish with green beans and mashed potatoes covered in a southern gravy.  My friend had the NY strip dinner. Cooked to perfection. They provide live entertainment around 7pm. With an aerial act on Monday night and Sunday night live music.   
The drink menu is vast and it will truly make you feel as if you are wasting away... My fav is the Tranquil Waters.  
On you way out, get your Jimmy Buffet swag.  Perfect for any Parrot Head."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place go such bad reviews. I had a great experience here, but I was also visiting during a weekday. On a Thursday afternoon, this place is pretty much all yours. We sat outside by the huge WestGate fountains, which is always entertaining to watch on a sunny afternoon.

The staff was friendly, the restaurant was pretty awesome (of course) and the food was great! I had the Cuban Sandwich and it was probably one of the best ones I've had. Though it is a little pricey, the portions are huge! So expect to get filled up."}
{"text":"Considering the crappy service we received elsewhere, we ended up eating at Margaritaville twice during our trip. We had great service both times and I was pleased with the food! 

The first time I had a bbq turkey burger which was really good. Normally turkey burgers can be on the dry side but it was really moist and tasteful! The second time I got the Mahi-Mahi and it was AMAZING! I really enjoyed the meals there and the drinks were great!"}
{"text":"Like others have mentioned, the service at Margaritaville leaves much to be desired. It took about 20 minutes to get menus, about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, another 10 minutes waiting for someone to bring us utensils. We went for breakfast and my omelette (something with crab and shrimp) was very good. Another person got the 'boatmeal' that came with a generous serving of fresh fruit on the side. The margaritas, however, not so good. Such a shame.

Our waiter looked like Seth Rogen, though. That's always nice."}
{"text":"I found myself walking...yes WALKING in the dead heat of summer past Margaritaville, and to tell you the truth, nothing sounded better than a big frozen margarita at that moment. In I hobbled, as I was wearing high heels ( who does this during the day besides strippers....oh wait, me..) and was greeted by the host. Friendly and efficiently, I was led directly to the bar, where the bartender was right there to fulfill my every frozen margarita need. He recommend several, and I sat there and drank three so quickly I got instant brain freeze. His suggestions were well worth it, and my craving for frozen alcohol was satisfied. Prices were decent for Vegas, not cheap by any means, but not outrageous as poolside ritas would have been.
I don't think I'd come here for food, as there are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, but when in need of a quick refreshing frozen rita, I'll be right back at Margaritaville."}
{"text":"I usually don't like these giant touristy places but Margaritaville is awesome. I wondered in here my very first time in Vegas and thought the atmosphere and decor was a bit cheesy but after my second margarita and first 10 minutes into their volcano nachos I was in love. Their pricing is great considering it's in Vegas right on strip across from Caesars. The portions are HUGE... so it's the perfect place to just sit and fight off a hangover and fill your stomach. The service has been perfect every time I've been. The last time I was there the place was packed I had a waiter who was on point the entire time, knew everything about each beer and entree we asked about, had our waters full the whole time, and even drew a detailed doodle of himself on the receipt. 

MARGARITAVILLE IS THE $H!T !!!"}
{"text":"it's a party on the inside, very cool decor and volcano show

better burgers than \"The Burger Joint\" in the same location

average food but worth the price"}
{"text":"Get the nachos. They are a must. 3 of us shared the nachos as our dinner and we still couldn't finish them off."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and got two burgers. They were pretty good, only issue is my boyfriends was a little too done for his liking. I had the 5 o' clock somewhere drink and it was good and strong. It's not too expensive for a Vegas restaurant."}
{"text":"Went on 7/8.  The place was crazy packed for opening weekend and so unprepared with the staffing. We waited over an hour in line at the bar no one would wait on us because one of the guys back there had no idea how to make drinks he told us.. he wAs still learning.. really?  No training?? Then we wanted to go to the balcony but the line was crazy .. plus the big margarita machine that plays JB music when it hits the op was not working.  We decided to leave because of the overpriced drink which was a glass of wine and a margarita on the rocks came to 19 bucks.  So overpriced!! Bad service at the bar.. so not prepared for opening weekend."}
{"text":"After years of visiting this place, I still only come for one thing...Five O'Clock Somewhere cocktails. This was the very first drink I purchased in Vegas when I became legal to drink and I've been ordering it ever since. I stop in for one whenever I'm in Vegas or at least try to. I enjoy the flavor despite it somewhat having the flavor of grapefruit. The cocktail also has a good amount of rum for Bacardi 151 fans.

I don't order much food here but if I were to call off any from the top of my head that I believe is worth ordering, it would be the seafood mac n cheese (formally lobster mac) and would have been the teriyaki steak that's no longer on the menu. I use to enjoy the steak that had the flavor of pineapple and do enjoy the mac n cheese that has a creamy cheese and crab flavor. All other entrees I've tried has been just ok, nothing to write home about. 

I've visited when it's been sort of dead and other's when it's completely live. The dead times were usually on random week day's when the Vegas strip isn't busy. Nevertheless, there's always good music playing and it's always fun to watch people get up and dance. Especially when they've had one too many drinks.

Five O'Clock Somewhere is my go to here and I'm happy it can still pack a punch year after year since my first time having it eleven years ago.

{"text":"Wow what can I say? I didn't get an further then the host desk before I received crap customer service. The lady or kid named Camile had no problem in expressing that she could care less about us or an other customer coming up to be seated. Her unfriendly attitude left a bad taste in my mouth. There was also a lady there who was suppose to seat us but before she wanted to do so she had to put lotion on her hands that she grabbed from her purse. YES ladies and gentlemen we watched her rub her hands with lotion for a good minute!!!!! At this time we said \"screw this!\". We walked out.....then I thought I will talk with the manager. I told her the whole story. About Camile and this other dud of an employee. I was told it happens to be a lot of issues with the host stand. They just had a meeting about the issues, AND yes they are Union employees which they can't do anything about. Wow! There you go! Never again will I go there and tell everyone I know that this place is the pits!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best views of the strip if you sit on the second floor and get a hit table.  We sat there for two hours with drinks, wings, pretzels.  The service was excellent and made sure we had our glass full.  Great music and ambience.  Watch what you order prices could get up there pretty quick!"}
{"text":"Suitable for a meal only if you are: 1) Under 25 years old, and 2) already drunk. 

I wasn't expecting a wine list, but I thought I could at least get a glass of white wine, that's what I was in the mood for. I didn't care if it was bad wine.. They had two whites listed on the drink menu, but were \"out of\" both of them. (When I saw a woman at the next table drinking a red wine out of a plastic cup I thought, thank god they are out of the white! They can't even trust the clientele with glassware!) So I asked for a Red Stripe, also on the menu. Nope, none of that, either. I was finally able to get an Amstel Light.

I had nachos. Chips heading toward stale and cold. Plastic cheese sauce, grisly beef, flavorless guacamole. We shared fajitas at the the table. The meat was cold, the beef was barely cooked, the rice had no seasoning. I couldn't wait to leave.

I'm not a chain snob, I'll eat at Chilis and Cheesecake Factory, occasionally Macaroni Grill. But this place? Seriously, just no."}
{"text":"We grabbed our first meal here out of conveniance when we checked into the Flamingo.  Check with your server for drink specials. We ended up with $5 24oz beers that were from a  party that they were trying to use up.  Nachos were huge and a great snack before we wandered out on the strip fo a walk. Wife had the tortilla soup which she liked."}
{"text":"First of all, very awesome atmosphere. Neato touristy crap that will surely excite you while sipping a large margarita out of a $16 dollar margarita, you get to keep the glass. 

The nacho appetizer CANNOT be tackled by one person as a meal, probably could make a meal for two people and they would both be full and need no other entrees and could easily be shared by 4-6 people and have there be plenty. 

Bonus points for our waiter that had handlebar moustache. 

Food was a teeny bit slow, but it was lunch and they were very busy. 

We asked for our margarita on the rocks, not frozen and received it frozen, but we drank it anyway... 

Tourists should and will do this, because its what tourists do... lol"}
{"text":"The service here was very slow. The food was just okay. It's a far cry from my mid-90s experience at Margaritaville in Key West. The bright spot was one fab server who gave us all kinds of tips on things to do. She was not our server, unfortunately. The prices were just a bit high for the offerings. Maybe if the service had been better I would have forgiven the prices."}
{"text":"After walking for a few hours around Vegas, even though we were about 80% inside, we were ready for frozen alcohol. The back bar has maybe 15 barstools and we were lucky to grab 4 together about 2:00 on a Saturday. It was busy and loud, but the bartenders were fast with the drinks...and refilling our water. 

They did give some other people a hard time, a middle aged woman wanted to order some drinks for her bachelorette party while they waited for a table and the bartender made her bring back all of the people in her group including her 75 year old grandma. He carded all of the 25-30ish year old women, including the one who was pregnant and just wanted water. It was awkward."}
{"text":"Nothing like a humongous margarita to add to the heartburn that has already been raging off mass amounts of pizza, booze and sleep deprivation.  SO WORTH IT.

Margaritaville is the shizniz.  The only lame part is having to down your drink before entering (and with 32oz American beer just bought on the street 10 min beforehand, this is no easy feat).  But alas, a few gulps later, we walked into a lively atmosphere with sticky floors and fantastic music.  Almost like a nightclub, but free and with much less douchebaggery, Margaritaville is a fantastic place to spend an hour or so, before hitting up the next spot on the strip.  The margaritas are super tasty, and expensive to boot.  But it's Vegas, so if you don't expect it it's your own damn fault.

Go for the margaritas.  Go for the music.  Go for JIMMY."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK, I sat outside and there is a good view of the strip.  The drinks were strong and staff was friendly.  It was OK"}
{"text":"GO FOR THE DRINKS, NOT THE FOOD!!!

My two girlfriends and I went in for a quick bite to re-energize for the long night of partying that was ahead of us, but we all felt so sick to our stomachs after eating our meals that we barely made it out that night. NOT my idea of a good time. It was awful, and I called to let the manager know that we were very unsatisfied with our meals (it was expensive!) but the manager never returned my call. I think that upset me the most.  

Now, we're college girls. We are NOT picky about food. My Cheeseburger In Paradise looked like a Quarter Pounder from McDonalds, which would have been fine if it had tasted as good as a Quarter Pounder.  It was gross. I ate less than half of it and had to stop because I was already feeling sick.  Very disappointing. And my friend couldn't swallow more than four bites of her taco salad.  At least the drinks were good. 

Margaritas = good. Everything else = rip off."}
{"text":"Way too much for lousy margaritas. Jimmy should take his name off this restaurant as it is an embarrassment compared to something like the Cabo Wabo Cantina. Now there's a very cool place with good food and drink."}
{"text":"When we walked in were told it was a 20 min wait or we can sit at the bar.  The place was not crowded and there were 6 employees standing by the hostess stand talking and many other employees just walking around.  There were many empty tables so not sure why we were not seated.  Finally sat outside.  Had the crab sandwich which seemed like the crab was old - not worth $16.  Service was Excellent!  This place is overrated and way over priced.

After reading other reviews it seems that everyone had the same experience...overpriced subpar food and poor staffing.  It does not appear they are doing anything to remedy their issues since the poor reviews continue to come in.  

Note that most reviews are from weekday visits and we were there at 2:00 pm so it's not like it is during busy weekend hours."}
{"text":"OMG...my wife swears the Lava Lava Shrimp is the best thing since sliced bread!!!!  I had the club sandwich and it was good, but pretty basic!!!  Have fun watching the girl slide down the slide!! Lmao"}
{"text":"Good size portions and food quality was fine, but definitely a bit pricey for typical bar food. Server was pretty friendly, but not so quick or attentive with the beverages from the bar. There was a live band and the were still playing the Jimmy Buffet videos with sound on the TVs, so they music was cancelling each other out. Asked the waitress if they turned and she noted they did not even though we have fell g we were not the first to bring up the issue per her reaction. A little chilly, so did not get to take advantage of the patios, but appear to be setup nicely. The layout did not have the feel or atmosphere of other Margaritavilles that we have visited. Giving a three as always a benefit bringing leftovers home!"}
{"text":"Blurg. 

First of all, after a hard afternoon of walking up and down the strip, we decide we want a snack and a margarita. It's Vegas, so who can blame us? 

But oh no. You want an appetizer and drinks only? You have to argue to get a seat. 

This, of course, annoyed the waiter in whose section we were seated. Question: \"Can we get the guacamole without cilantro (I hate cilantro!)?\" He stares at us for a couple of seconds for effect, and says, flatly, \"no.\" No \"oh, sorry, no,\" or \"no, it's made in big batches,\" but \"no (subscript: why the hell are you asking?)\" Regardless, the waiter made it really clear that an estimated $33 tab wasn't worth his trouble. 

Anyway, we got the queso and two margaritas. The margaritas were honestly pretty good. But we ate a cup of queso and a basket of tortilla chips, and both the BF and I felt pretty darned sick for awhile after. I'm not sure why. Maybe it was the flight to Vegas? But doubtful. Neither of us are strangers to the occasional (OK, more than occasional) indulgence in fried food. 

The bad service continued, with the waiter alternating between inattention and b*tchiness. But the margaritas were good, so I'll give it two stars. Just come, order your margaritas to go, and save yourself the hassle."}
{"text":"It's a pretty straightforward rendition of the Margaritaville chain formula found at touristy spots around the world.  Nothing too fancy, but nice enough for the tourists venturing through the strip.  I ate here with a group that wasn't too adventurous (but wanted something non-buffet); the menu is pretty straightforward so I opted for the beef and mushroom fajita.  It was ginormous and very very filling.  Although it wasn't anything super sophisticated, it was very satisfying and tasty... much like Vegas in general lol."}
{"text":"Have always wanted to visit Margaritaville, and when my girls bought me a golf bag from here for my b-day! (See Picture) I had to come here now. Well, wife and I was at the movie theater seeing the 25th anniversary of Phantom of the Opera! (had to mentioned the play) So we had dinner before the 7:30 showing. Since we were there on a Wednesday, place was empty. We were seated near the center by the stage, Don't know why they wouldn't have seated us at a better location. Any who, John was our server. He asked for our drink order, I ordered a diet coke, arnold palmer, and a strawberry margarita. You can't really go wrong on drinks, but the wife wasn't that impressed with the margarita? We started off with the Volcano Nachos, now when John came back with the drinks. We then proceeded to order our dinner. Now if you see the picture I posted of the nachos, you will realize how stupid it was for us to order our dinner. We did not know how large their nachos were! And would have been nice if John would have told us! I guess he assumed since wife and I have some love handles, that we could have taken care of the nachos and dinner. First! The nachos were very good, had black beans, chicken, green onions, some kind of enchilada sauce! But this beast could have feed at least five people!! Now we asked John to put our dinner in a to go box instead and ended up eating it the next day! We had their fried chicken, with mashed potatoes, green beans. It was very good reheated. Just wondered how good it would have been from the grill? Overall we really liked this place, and would have had a four-star rating. But JOHN! put a smile on your face! And don't be afraid to mention, are you sure you want to order more, since your nachos can feed a whole family!"}
{"text":"So after our less than desireable experience at Kabuki, my DH and I came here for lunch. Low and behold, the hostess was smiling, the waiter came within MINUTES of us being seated and the food/drink was equally as quick. In the amount of time it took us to WAIT to eat at Kabuki, we were in, enjoyed a nice meal and out...in 45 minutes. 

I enjoyed the chicken sandwhich...delicious! Their french fries are really great...or perhaps I was just so friggin' hungry by this point I would have settled on eating my own FINGERS! 

My DH had the pulled pork sandwhich and said it was equally as good as my entree. The waiter was SO great and had the nicest smile. Totally attentive and super friendly...at last....someone who actually ENJOYS their job!

I can't say one bad thing about this place but also there isn't anything spectacular about it either. The other reviewers are right on when they say something is missing....perhaps live fish??? ;0)"}
{"text":"You're certainly paying for the experience at Margarittaville.  The drinks are decent (and more reasonably priced than the food) and the food is good (but much to expensive for what you get).   The atmosphere is great though, especially if you like classic rock.   Even when the restaraunt is super busy, I find it pretty relaxing.   

I've always had good service, the kind you can expect from a more expensive restaraunt.  I'm not sure if I've just been lucky or not considering some of the other reviews, but I've never had the bad service experiences other yelpers talk about.   Be sure to save up if you plan to go because realistically you're looking at $20-$30 per person, more if you plan on getting some drinks.   Still, if you like the ambiance, you'll probably have a good time."}
{"text":"I HAD to go here for breakfast because it's Margaritaville and where else can you get breakfast at Margaritaville than Vegas?  I had the French Quarter omelet and a margarita.  Toward the end of breakfast service, they restrict seating to the bar and a small dining area.  I sat at the bar and got my drink well before my meal.  There's nothing like getting buzzed before breakfast.  Seriously, the staff was friendly and the food was great.  A must do in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok, this place totally hit the spot. My friend had seen someone carrying around one of their blender cups and decided that she would just die if she did not leave Vegas with one of her own. So we stopped in around 1:30-2ish for lunch and drinks. We sat at the bar, waited slightly longer than desired for food, but it wasn't too bad. When it came out, it was everything we could have asked for and more. Maybe too much more? My friend soon realized the issues that may come with dragging around a drink. Oh well, it was fun and yummy just the same."}
{"text":"Its... Just okay. It's not anything out of the ordinary. 
CUSTOMER SERVICE: Was pretty good. The host seemed unhappy and seemed like she disnt want to sit us down. BUT the server we had was great. He recommend drinks and food for our first time on my birthday.
DRINKS: I only had 1 mixed drink and it was definetly just good.
FOOD: we had an appetizer which was a trio of some sorry and it was average. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Average food, mediocre service. I think every table in the place is broken and wobbly."}
{"text":"Came here just for drinks and I wasn't let down. Started off with the margarita with the beer in it and it was GOOD! I don't like beer and I thoroughly enjoyed it. We then moved on to some concoction that had about 3 or 4 liquors in it (one was the \"5 o clock somewhere\"). I wish we were hungry because the food looked damn good...especially the nachos. I have to go back again."}
{"text":"After ordering a drink that tasted a little funny I returned to the bar and noticed a foul odor and several fruit flies. I looked around and noticed a health code violation.  Drinks were stacked on top of each other and gathering condensation. Trying to be discreet, I told the bartender. He looked at me like I was stupid. I then requested to speak to the manager- this is the kind of thing that will shut a place down! I explained the concern to the manager and he immediately began removing the stacks and agreed with the observation. He then proceeded to wash the glasses over again and place then properly without stacking. Glad they took note of an observation but why do the bar staff not know proper procedure? Yuck! Sorry I had a drink here!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 12 that came to be seated at 10:00 and were told it would be 45 minutes to an hour to be seated. We then asked if we split into 2 groups if it would be any quicker and were told no. We agreed to wait and walked to the bar and passed an empty table for 12. One person went back and inquired about the table and we were told there was a large group ahead of us. 10 minutes passed and we went back and no one was seated, we were then told there was another group ahead of us, but we could be seated as two separate groups and we agreed. We were shown by the 3 girls standing at the hostess station where to go. We seated ourselves and asked someone to bring us menus after sitting for 10 minutes. At 10:38 we were told the kitchen closed in 20 minutes and that we needed to order now. No one was ever seated in the original table for 12 the entire time."}
{"text":"Always a great experience.  This trip we just had drinks, but everytime I have been here previously I have enjoyed the food and service.  Prices are a lil steep, but not unrealistic.  

The margaritas here live up to the name though.  They are delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really in a sour mood!!! Came all the way to Vegas and the First spot I hit of course is Margaritaville for their Awesome wings and to my dismay they no longer sell them!! What's the point of even still being open if you don't sell wings!  

Marc our Bartender was awesome...

Please bring back the wings this place will not be the same with them!"}
{"text":"This place is fine, not great. I disagree with a few Yelpers who say this is a \"must-stop restaurant\" on the Strip.  The food is average and the prices are a little high...and unless you LOVE Jimmy Buffett, the ambiance is also average. 

We went here for lunch on a Monday after our family party of 9 didn't like the menu of a nearby restaurant. Fortunately they were able to seat us right away (unlike the other venue).  We ordered the nachos for the table (chili on the side). They were pretty good (not WOW like other people on here are saying) and hit the spot while we waited for our food. I had the taco salad which was so-so and my sis-in-law had the lava lava shrimp which she said was undercooked.  My parents split the Caesar salad...I didn't hear them raving about it but I also didn't hear them complain. I'm pretty sure their mac and cheese kids option was just a box of Kraft served in a dish. The kids quesadilla came with a lot of chicken and on a huge platter. Actually all the portions were huge so come hungry or ask for to go boxes.  

Won't race back esp since there are a ton of other restaurants in the Linq Pavillion but it wasn't a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio.  My husband ordered the full rack of ribs.  Seriously, there were probably 7 small ones.  Very skimpy meal for $16.  No chips and salsa while we waited, no dinner roll.  You would think that with ordering 2 full meals, there would have been something. The salmon was good but the price is not on the menu.  We asked the server the price before ordering it.  When the bill came, it was more, and they didn't offer to adjust the bill.  Overall, very disappointed.  Will not go back.
Best part was watching the fountains in the courtyard."}
{"text":"Fun place to chill with a lot of friends and I really like the outdoors patio.  This is a good starting spot in Vegas.  The food wasn't great, but I guess that's not the point.  

If you go, try to sit on the patio on the 3rd floor.  It is less crowded than downstairs and has a cooler atmosphere."}
{"text":"Go here for the strong margarita's to escape the heat of the strip. .

The margaritas we had were great.  Try them on the rocks or frozen--doesn't really matter.  I was pretty surprised to be honest, as they just make huge batches of the stuff and pump it out en masse. 

The food wasn't anything spectacular, but you most certainly could do worse on the strip for your money.  You are really paying for the atmosphere here.  Everything is tacky and very Vegas, but that's why you are there in the first place.

Definitely would go again, just nothing incredible or mind-blowing in my book."}
{"text":"Fantastic margaritas and awesome atmosphere!!

We came here at about noon on a Sunday.  We got seated in about 15 minutes indoors (it was gorgeous outside, so there was a really long wait for a table out there) and we spent the time shopping in the store.

The service was a bit spotty.  It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to notice we were even there, and then another 20 minutes for our drinks to come out.  I had also ordered a salad with my meal, and I had to flag him down about 30 minutes after I ordered it to ask where it was.  I mean, it was lettuce and tomatoes--not that serious.

But all in all, the food was good (super delicious nachos!!) the landshark and my margaritas were amazing, and the atmosphere made you almost not care that it took 30 minutes to throw lettuce on a plate.  Almost..."}
{"text":"No wait to be seated, but waited nearly 40 min for our food, just to have it come out completely cold which is frustrating when it's not cheap. Drinks also taste mostly like sour mix. Location is great, I had high hopes, but was left disappointed."}
{"text":"The ambiance for a large group of families that included some kids was great. They could be loud and no one would notice. The server was friendly but our food was so very slow. I mean we were no longer hungry when we noticed it had been so long and not to mention, the food was awful and way over priced for its quality, although I do understand it being a tourist location and all."}
{"text":"This definitely screams tourist trap, but it's a fun place too. My friends and i had drinks and nachos here and boy those nachos....it's enough to feed a family 10 i think. The margaritas are good, unless you get it on the rocks, you can't really taste the alcohol in the frozen ones, but they are still yummy. The staff and our waitress was pretty cool, they had a good energy and seemed (at least seemed) to be enjoying themselves. I'm only giving it three stars just because it's nothing really special and it wouldn' t make me have to come here the next time, you know?"}
{"text":"A very interesting place on the strip, located next to Flamingo and right across the street from O'sheas. You can either go to the bar, which overlooks Caesar's Palace or the restaurants which is uniquely decorated. Very colorful and scenic surrounding. Kind of a tight squeeze to get around, but its manageable. 

The wife and I came here for dinner, after watching a show at O'sheas. Of course the usual wait for dinner, since it was a bit crowded at the time. But it seems to be reasonable time to wait. It is on the crowded part of the strip, so you got people coming and going. But impressed on how things are handled. 

The wife and I, mainly had one thing in mind. Is to attempt the Volcano Nachos that was a well known dish for Margaritaville. We wanted to see for ourselves on how massive these nachos are. From the looks of it, we should of invited 3-4 more people to help us finish the nachos. In my opinion, it was really good. Wish I could of finished it, I hate wasting food. The nachos over exceeded our expectations, so I have to give credit where credit is due. Even though the Volcano Nachos was a lot of food, we needed more flavor and we just ordered more. I ordered the shrimp, which was good and had that coconut twist, which made it delicious. I was able to eat all of it, and was able to swipe at the nachos still. But there comes a time where I had to throw in the towel and admit I was full. 

Overall, I like the place cause it was fulfilling. I did enjoy the kindness of the staff. Depend on when you go, depends on the wait. Since we did go during dinner time, I usually give the waiters 10 minutes to come around and it seems like they been on top of things that night. The Nachos were good, but I would suggest to order it, if you have a group of people, other than you and one other person."}
{"text":"we had a private party on the 2nd floor & the staff was great!! 3.5 stars

----FROZEN MARGARITAS! of course.. its MARGARITAVILLE!! you can get them w/ flavors & even mix flavors! (guava's not bad but a bit sweet) ORIGINAL is the way to go!
---Fried chicken wings w/ honey mustard sauce were nice & crispy!
---spring rolls: not bad for a \"mexican\" joint
---mini cheeseburgers: the buns weren't the best, but the patties were cooked well

had a blast!! wouldn't mind coming back for some finger foods & margaritas"}
{"text":"Delicious Mango Margaritas! When busy the place seems unorganized or under staffed. Food is ok. 4 star is for the margaritas!!"}
{"text":"I visited Margaritaville before a Cardinals game in December.  I was with extended family - there was about 8 people in our group.  Admittedly, we should have arrived earlier to get a table.  We put our name down for a table, and waited around the bar for over an hour.  Meanwhile, we saw guests who arrived after us taking large tables in the bar area. We didn't realize that these tables were first come-first served, and the servers did not make us aware of this when we arrived.

We saw a large table sit empty for quite some time.  Myself and others in my party asked if we could at least sit there while we waited, and were told No.  The hostesses couldn't give us a straight answer on when we would be seated.  Finally, they sat us at the empty table, and told us they were trying to catch up on their other tables before seating us.  We told them that was fine, but would have appreciated at least knowing that, and could have sat there for drinks rather than standing around the crowded bar.  We asked to speak with a manager, and one never showed up.

Once we were seated, the service was decent and fast.  But the food was mediocre and not worth the long wait.  I understand that they are very busy before games, but the way they handled a large party was very poor."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar just for drinks so I don't know about the food but we were well taken care of and the drinks were great. 

I'm not a huge drinker or crazy about really strong drinks so my Strawberry Tropical Fruit margarita was PERFECT for me. My husband got some beer and an Uptown Top Shelf margarita - it was too strong for me but he liked it. 

With a name like \"Margaritaville,\" you'd better be good at margaritas and they are here. There's a margarita for everyone.

We'll be back before we leave!!!"}
{"text":"You lookin' for patio seating, unpretentious folks and a serving of nachos the size of a shrub? Margaritaville.
We waited about 15 minutes for a seat on their third-story patio on a warm sunny day. As we had just visited Fat Tuesday in the Forum Shoppes, that 15 minutes went by nice and quickly. Once we were seated, I decided that double-fisting wasn't a bad idea and ordered the Woman On Top (their version of a skinny margarita). But wait! The server came back and said they were out of the low-cal ingredients for the drink, so I sadly ordered a normal margarita. Maybe it's standard policy, maybe it was a mistake, or maybe it was the pathetic look on face... not sure what caused my good fortune, but when the bill came... no margarita to be found! Thanks, unknown server!A party of four of us couldn't even finish the nachos that came about 15 minutes after ordering. Had we all been a bit more tipsy, I'm sure we might have finished... but even that's debatable. Trust me, four large hungry guys would be perfectly satisfied with these.
It's not the fancy-uppity-atmospheric Vegas that most people flock to the Strip for... but for a midday stop for your aching feet, a snack in your belly and a drink in your tank, I would definitely consider Margaritaville."}
{"text":"I am seriously disappointed in this Margaritaville.  We stopped in for dinner before a concert and it was fairly busy but nothing they couldn't handle based on the size of the place.  There were 4 adults and 4 kids in our party.  We all ordered fairly quickly and food arrived in an appropriate amount of time.  1 of the meals came out completely wrong, like not even the right dish.  Our server took it away and then brought the right dish out.  Then, 2 of our meals tasted so bad, we couldn't eat them.  They just tasted like they were off, almost spoiled.  They did offer to make new items and we had them make one other dish for my friend and I decided to pass and just get dessert so I ordered a piece of cheesecake.  It then took another 20 minutes to get my cheesecake.  I do want to give props to the manager who handled it correctly but overall, I am giving 1 star purely on the fact that the food was completely generic and not good.   The food tasted and looked like mass, cafeteria food.  There are better restaurants at Westgate so next time I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative stars I would.  I dat at the bar and got zero service even though it was a slow night.  Ask for a Bud Light on tap and was told it was out.  I thought, wellchange it.  Decided on a Miller Lite as a substitute.  I wanted another and after spending 10 minutes trying to get a bartenders attention.  They were all congregated at the far end of the bar.  I ordered another Miller Lite and was told it was out, well change it out.  Upon requesting to check out I was told it was cash only because their credit card m machine was down.

When I came in tonight I was wondering why they we so empty.  Now I know, they've gone totally downhill.  I can't believe they will remain open unless management changes and the staff retrained."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better nachos! Probably the best nachos in Vegas! There is a mountain of chips covered in cheese, nacho cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapeño's and more cheese! Definitely can share between 2-4 people. The service was great and it'll be a staple place for me every time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was decent, staff was very attentive but its your typical chain resturant."}
{"text":"Always one of our favorite places to stop. Love the volcano nachos.  More than enough for the 2 of us to share. Probably still be fine if it were 3-4 of us. We eat here at least one time every trip."}
{"text":"Service sucks.   20 mins for water?   Had to go to the bar to get the waitress attention.  She was too busy having a conversation with other co workers."}
{"text":"Best raspberry margarita on the strip! Stop by and get one. Very friendly and great service."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to go and enjoy your free time. Delicious food and amazing staff. Our server, Joshua, was EXCELLENT. He was bubbly and happy and smiling the whole time, answered all of our requests, and was so easy to talk and joke around with. Definitely recommend him! 

Definitely recommend the volcano nachos!"}
{"text":"Loved the nachos! They were delish.... staff was super friendly and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Depends on what you are looking for. Its not fine dining but not bar food either.   I dont understand the people that complain about the tacky decor?? Its Vegas..have you visited the Wynn lately?   Anyway, we visit this place each time we are in Vegas.  At first we were surprised by the $12 Margaritas but after a couple, realized that they are worth it.  Top shelf tequila and usually plenty of it!  Their $12 margarita much better deal than the 8$ bud light at the PH pool.  The food is fairly good but we really come here for the atmosphere and the margaritas.  After like the 7th time here I finally discovered the third floor. Wow!  I am seriously pissed that I never went upstairs before!  Excellent view of the CP and the strip...and great to sit and enjoy the sun and soak up the LV atmosphere. My only complaint is that our first margarita was a little weak by Margaritaville standards but the next 4 were just as I remembered.  Stumbled out into the afternoon sunlight and had my best night gambling in 2 years!   A group of us come out here 2x/year and plan on visiting Margaritaville every time.  Keep the third floor open for us!"}
{"text":"What a sweet bartender, so funny. I love it. The margaritas were delicious. Pretty pricy but so is everything else. It's still alright."}
{"text":"If there is a must-stop restaurant on The Strip to pop into and have a good time, its this one. Doesn't matter if its for lunch or dinner, Margaritaville is well worth it.

The regular margaritas are not too sweet or sour, and the other mixed drinks appear to have just enough alcohol content in them (all depends on your bartender that day). The perfect margarita? Whoa! Strong, strong, STRONG! This is one drink that will knock you on your butt if you are careful. 

For the food, what can I say? Good-sized portions for the price. The fish tacos for lunch was served at a larger quantity than expected, with side choices of black beans, etc. The jambalaya was served extra spicy, which made the meal truly exceptional to remember. And you didn't get too stuffed within the process.

Now, the evening entertainment. For those that haven't been here before, there is a 10% entertainment \"tax\" assessed on your bill during the evening hours. The reason is that there are 3 shows per evening during the weekday, and 4 shows on the weekends. It is highly recommended asking your hostess whether you can have a table either on the pirate ship or close to the pirate ship in order to really enjoy the entertainment up close. My evening entertainment consisted of watching three men in stilts acting a fool, while a very attractive female in a bikini & thong (truly sexy as hell) takes a dip into a giant green-filled margarita blender while also doing a Cirque du Soleil-type of performance on a giant hook afterwards. Its worth seeing while you await your drinks & dinner!

The servers were really attentive, and seemed to be enjoying what they do. And of course, you get to hear a lot of Jimmy Buffet's biggest hits on the large screens all around the venue. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants on The Strip that I'll easily return to!"}
{"text":"The food is bad!!!! Drinks were good, so was the service, but I have never had a worse mushroom cheeseburger in my life. My boyfriend got a chicken sandwhich and couldn't finish it. How do u mess up basics like that?? Gross :("}
{"text":"Firstly, their margaritas are really good. Well, at least the one I had was delicious but $12 for a tiny plastic cup is ridiculous. The service here was horrible the night I came. A waiter walked away from me after asking him if I can sit in a booth because I had my grandmother who walks with a cane with me and he said no we only have high-top seating available. He told me he couldn't help me so I asked to speak to the manager and I while I was explaining my situation to the manager, he interrupts and tells the manager that's not what happened, acting very belligerent and he's a liar because he knows good and got damn well he said, \"I can't help you\" and started walking away. The manager Keisha, I believe that was her name, helped us and was able to get a regular table. During our meal, I saw the same waiter telling his coworkers what happened and he was talking ish and that is very unprofessional. 
The food was mediocre. We had the shrimp & grits and crab cake sandwich that was overcooked. Bad first time experience."}
{"text":"We went here for a sports game and sat at the bar.  We had the volcano nachos: chili and the works on them.  They were some of the best Nachos I have ever had, and absolutely huge.  They were around $10 bucks and we couldn't finish them as our meal!  Also, we had house margaritas.  They were around $7.50 and very delicious and very potent.  You are feeling pretty tipsy after 2.  I was skeptical, but our experience was a great value."}
{"text":"do not come to this establishment! racism rampant and would not take my husbands federal id! avoid at all costs!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a bunch of times, it's always a fun time, nothing really bad to say about it...some of the entrees are a bit pricey, but I guess you're kind of also paying for the experience.  Lively and entertaining for both kids and adults alike, and I defy you not to start singing along with at least a few of the songs playing overhead!

For being a Saturday evening, we didn't have to wait too too long to be seated (about 15 minutes).  Our server greeted us quickly and was sure to forewarn us that they were having issues with the computer system so things were running a little more slowly than usual.  We weren't in a hurry so it was okay, and we appreciated the heads-up.  He was friendly and attentive.  One of the managers also greeted us warmly as we waited for our meals.  We were pleased with the service.  

This was my first time as a vegan patron and I was super happy to learn that their Veggie Burger is actually made with the vegan Boca patty...hooray!  So my dinner was a veggie burger, which wasn't the most delicious meal I've ever had, but sure beat having to order a plain side salad or tiny dish of steamed veggies.  My husband opted for dessert only, but his brownie and ice cream dish might as well have been a meal, it was humongous.  Our daughter's burger was good sized and she loved it.  Everything was to our liking, no complaints.

This isn't what I'd call a super intimate environment, not a whole lot of privacy and the tables are pretty packed together, but it's a fun, energetic vibe.  Many times they have clowns, stilt-walkers, or balloon artists wandering the floor to entertain the kiddos during dinner.  It's also pretty decent \"after hours\" when the adult environment takes over...good drinks, good music, a dance floor for those who really get to feelin' it...I've had some good times here.

Margaritaville is usually a pretty good bet, in my opinion.  Nothing bad to say, I like this place a lot.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Love the Beer Rita and the Cheddar Burger with sweet potato fries. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Ugh! Where to start... well first, the service is great! This review is a direct reflection on the cooking. Las night I went in with my partner and ordered the jambalaya and seafood Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese, great, but the jamabalaya was so salty it was unbearable. I felt like I was eating a salt shaker. Then went in for breakfast and ordered the steak and eggs (twice). My steak, ordered medium, was cooked more than well. Sent back and came back, well again! The taste was ungodly and then the eggs, ordered over medium, were so undercooked the egg whites were runny. Go here to get a great cocktail! My bartender this morning was incredible! So nice, attentive and fun, but unfortunately the food was unbearable. And I'm a local, please don't recommend this place unless you want a good drink."}
{"text":"I can't come to Vegas and not stop here at least once. I love their drinks and their food it's pretty decent. 
We landed in Vegas and didn't want to go too crazy on our first night since we landed pretty late and were still on east coast time. 
We made our way here and found some chairs at the back of the bar. 
I got the zombie which is a great drink and nice and strong. 
My friend and I decided to share the chili nachos and I'm so glad we shared because the nachos were huge and between the both of us we couldn't finish them. The nachos could have used more chili but they were good enough to be bar food. 
The bartender was very attentive and even entertain us with our silly questions about his background since we couldn't figure out what he was. Yes these are the stupid questions my friends and I have while we drink lol"}
{"text":"I ate here for breakfast when I was in Vegas back in June.  I didnt have much of an appetite, but I had the short stack and it was good.  The waitress was very busy, but she didnt forget about us. 

What I liked most was the view.  It was raised over the strip and was great for people watching."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. The \"huge\" nachos literally only had toppings on the  very top. Half down it was plain chips !?! Barely enough to share for two people unless you like eating plain chips. BUT the margaritas were great! That's it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite, great atmosphere and even better food. Hubby got the chicken wings and I got the burger.. one of the best burgers ever! I got one of their mixed drinks and it was so tasty! They had popular music on during dinner and then a live band. Band was good but played older music like BRICK HOUSE. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"25 cent beers with a chance of blackout.

Yes, you read that correctly....25 cents....That is how much a beer cost on wednesday nights. I know what you are thinking. \"no way is a full beer 25 cents.\" As a matter of fact, youre right, its a half of beer, perfect chugging size.

Now if you find yourself ballin on a budget be aware that everybody else is also ballin on a budget. You aren't going to rub elbows with the elite of the Pittsburgh working class, but does that make it less fun? Not at all. On wednesday nights it's a very mixed crowd. I have drank with homeless men, guys with rolls of hundreds, and the normal working american. 

Friday and Saturday nights are good too, just like the rest of the south side. You wont spend more then 2 bucks on a beer between 10-12 and the frozen margaritas are just delightful tequilla slushies which is never a bad thing."}
{"text":"Very casual.  Sit anywhere, the menus are on the table and eventually the server will show up.  She was friendly as all the staff was.

Good selection of foods, on the high side of prices for a casual restaurant.

I ordered the chili with a side salad.

The chili came out warm. I had to send it back but when it did come back it was very hot, good and a big bowl.
My salad never came, but that was good since the chili was enough. I was expecting a small bowl of chili for the price but it was bigger than I thought. Yes, I did mention  it was pricy but not the chili everyone else's food.

My wife ordered the fish tacos. She said they were good and they came with a side of chili too. 

Drinks were good. The atmosphere is party and fun.

Overall a casual sit down place to hang and have a light lunch or snacks."}
{"text":"I went here because you can never go wrong with a Margaritaville! It is typical but it is always great! 
Although the patio is small it is right on the strip so if you can find a place it is a great place to sit!"}
{"text":"Love the food - we ate their the first evening in town and all four mornings. Their hash browns are homemade and all the seafood is fresh. They have no problem accommodating special diet requests. We were in the door as soon as they opened so that we could be seated at one of two tables outside. Bloody Marys come in different varieties - we liked the original and the Key West best. The manager greeted us personally on two occasions and all our servers were friendly and efficient. Stacey W. - thanks for making us laugh!"}
{"text":"So we decided to check out the new Margaritaville in the flats this Sunday. It's unfortunate that it's a typical tourist trap restaurant and even though it opened to much fanfare, I don't see this place lasting too long. 

As we waited, and waited, and waited for a server to make our way to the table to take a drink order, we watched the table next to us experience several issues with their orders which had come out incorrectly. I said to my wife, \"a place like this you better expect your order to come out wrong, they just don't care enough about good service.\"

We got our drink orders finally. I paid $8.50 for the chocolate banana colada. It was delicious but obviously overpriced. Wife got a mango margarita and it was very tasty as well. 

My wife ordered the caprese burger on a gluten free bun, my daughter got the kids chicken tenders with fries- we asked for ketchup instead of honey mustard. And I got the volcano nachos with no sour cream.....

You guessed it- wife's burger came out on a regular bun, my daughters chicken tenders had honey mustard and my nachos came and with sour cream. All three were corrected quickly enough, but c'mon, pay a little attention to detail. 

The decor and atmosphere were great but how is this place going to last? Who is coming down to the flats in the dead of winter to pay for overpriced drinks and crummy service. Best of luck margaritaville!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Margaritaville. We came for the gluten-free menu. I was only disappointed that the brownie sundae on the gluten-free menu is no longer available--we were really looking forward to it. We got the volcano nachos to share (must be a shared item because it is HUGE). I was disappointed that there is a bit a gluten-free kids menu, I was going to ask for the Jr cheeseburger sans buns and pick apples or carrots for the side, but we decided to share instead (she's 7). We maybe ate half of the volcano, but I'm satisfied. The nachos were $15.99 and i know would have spent a lot more for less food elsewhere. I got the blended Who's to Blame margarita. $9.75
Not the place is done at regularly, but on vacation with few other gluten-free choices, absolutely."}
{"text":"Not a place for large groups.  Took a group here (75 plus people) and service was unprepared and seemingly inexperienced with serving large groups.  Also no good place to pull a bus up to for group dropoff and pickup.  Rough and awkward experience...won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken for $16.99. What a pitiful yardbird that was, extremely dry and then the green beans that went with it were not even cooked!! Margaritas defiantly helped me choke down my dinner and sleep a little better too :)"}
{"text":"what an awesomely tacky and fun place.

the theme here is Some Sort of Tropical. there's a show at some point, involving pirates on stilts, a volcano, balloon hats, everyone clapping in unison, and a girl in a bikini in a dunk tank, none of which seem to make sense, but who cares? 

I had the pulled pork sandwich on garlic toasted bread, which was actually pretty good, though the fries were standard.

the nachos: they are piled high and stacked with beans, cheese, meats, sour cream, and guac, and most definitely NOT microwaved. incredible stuff - and the 7 of us at the table were just able to finish them!

the drinks: our waiter actually advised against getting the giant ones because he said the ice melts too fast and dilutes it. myself and a few other people in our party had \"The Perfect Margarita\" which was described to us as \"pretty much just alcohol and lime juice\" and definitely did the trick. a little too much salt for my taste, but the alcohol helped block that out.

major props to our waiter (I think his name was John) - he was from Hoboken! - he actually was helpful with recommendations.

the price is not that bad actually. I think we each chipped in about $25-30.

thanks to this place \"Wasting Away in Margaritaville\" is stuck in my head. curse you, Jimmy."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly satisfied by my dinner tonight. It wasn't amazing and unique, being that it was just fish tacos that I had. But I'd reccomend and return to eat here. Atmosphere was cool. They have a mini show, which was interesting...The fish was yummy."}
{"text":"Alot of parking and easy access in the afternoon.
Service was good and staff all very friendly to make the experience better.
Food quality was medium nothing to Yelp about. Looked better than it tasted. Had jerk chicken that was just broiled chicken breasts and a light carribean dipping sauce (whatever). Doors were open and the animal kingdom came in. Birds flying around and pesky flies and knats NASTY!
Drinks tasty and presented well. Overall mediocre event . Probably won't do it again as there's lots of options here."}
{"text":"I was introduced to the whole Jimmy Buffet / Margaritaville thing about 5 years back and I have to say I'm really glad I got to feel what it's like to listen to the music, drink boat drinks and eat good food.  It is an experience you can create at home and definitely here at Margaritaville.

The food is fantastic, I love their crab salad.  Margaritas are the best I have ever had when it comes to flavor and consistency (there is one Mexican restaurant I love  that is the best when it comes to size and alcohol content!).  The Raspberry margarita is superb and even if you're just walking by you can get the premade stuff and it doesn't taste like it's made with a mix.  

The food is inexpensive and you get to look at awesome scenery.

This is a really great lunch spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Dreadful, yet expensive, margarita: virtually no lime flavor at all.  If you want to be assaulted by a corn syrup and rail booze drink and pay $10 or more for the experience then this is the place to go.  The place is always busy so you will have to wait, and have workers and inebriated Las Vegas strip people bumping into you,  to receive said product."}
{"text":"So we were looking for breakfast, and decided to take a gamble on a non traditional option.  The atmosphere is great as always, but the hostess and wait staff seem less than thrilled to be working.  The hostess was gruff with us and others concerning breakfast cutoff times.  We made it by 5 minutes...our waitress was helpful and polite.  I ordered Key West omelet with blue crab and shrimp and my husband went more traditional. My omelet was dry and the avocado was rotten inside.  However, the other parts of our meal were adequate.  It's a fun place but maybe just stick to lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"We had breakfast this morning...the omelet with crab, shrimp and avacado tasted pretty great actually. It would have been a damn site better if it had been hot fresh off the grill and the hash browns and toast had pretended to be warm. Really? Those kinds of prices and they can't even deliver fresh, hot food? Add to that cold butter that will never melt on the cold toast. I love the atmosphere and vibe but the food? Colour me disappointed. Regardless, I will visit again the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I went out on a limb, and got the jambalaya plate.
It was awesome. Just be warned that it is spicy.
5 of 5 stars.
My wife shared a fish taco plate with my daughter. The taco had a decent size piece of fish.
4.5 stars. 
My other daughter had a Chicken sandwich plate.  
4.5 stars.
My son had a cheeseburger plate.
5 stars.
Great atmosphere, and our waiter (Vigil) gave us great service.
Be advised that there's a volcano show with a bikini dancer. Hey...it's Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Eh I wasn't impressed. I enjoy the atmosphere in Orlando better. We sat in the bar and the server seemed disinterested in serving us. We arrived an hour before they closed which was really early for Vegas and he told us three times within the hour that they closed soon. It was like Dude we get the message we will leave your table in time for you to go home. The drinks we got were great but not proportioned to the price."}
{"text":"The food was good but not great and way too overpriced for what it was worth. I know it's Vegas but wow, there were chicken strips on the menu for 20$. That's just insane. Service was good but slow.. took a while to just get a cup of water."}
{"text":"After attending a graduation ceremony at the stadium; my husband and I headed here considering we're Buffett fans. We sat at the bar where we were greeted by a friendly & engaging bartender, Matthew. His prompt and professional service heightened our experience here. His suggestions were spot on. We tried several margarita variations and loved them all! I'm glad we stopped by since we live in the east valley. Our last visit to Margaritaville was in Vegas. It's nice to see  this type of service consistent in all their establishments. My husband and I split the  steak & shrimp fajitas- quite tasty! Thanks for a truly amazing Buffett experience! We'll be back- of course!"}
{"text":"Im more of a 3.9/5

Love the margaritavilles, Here is a few things to expect when you go here

Its not cheap, which is a bummer.  20oz landshark (garbage beer mind you) $7, ridiculous, but they know youll pay it, and pay it I sure did.  Miller talls $10

Food is ok, standard burgers with an island twist.  $9+

Honestly what you are paying for is the experience, which is cool.  I really hope this one can last unlike the one in Cinci which closed recently, issue I have is that this place is HUGE, not right on the river and NE Cleveland gets 5 months of cold weather, not exactly a great place for island style bars.

Roof top is cool, lounge couches and chairs as well, which overlooks FWD and part of the river.  

I love my Jimmy B, so I will def.come back, but for those not a huge fan or all about the 'vacation beach feel', this place may just be A-ok

Just make sure you are wastin away in margaritaville."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to writing the review, ate here awhile ago.  Experience was great.  Ahh, that smell inside, reminds you of a beach.  Hostess was great, asked if we could sit on rooftop for a great view of the strip -no issues.  They have water misting outside leaving you cool during the summer evening.  

We ate on a Sunday, so no wait to eat, also, we may have gone before peak hours.  I ordered landshark (jimmy Buff beer) and my lady ordered the blender margarita, was expensive, but worth it (according to her).  Both of us got the signature burgers, plenty of food to go around.

Would definitely eat here again, would recommend the outdoor section that overlooks the strip.  I cannot speak for what experience you may have eating inside, but outside was extremely nice.  Waitress was great"}
{"text":"We came here a couple of years ago and we loved it. The prices were reasonable, the service was great and it had a fun atmosphere.

Now, this restaurant is just a tourist trap. We asked for the nachos and requested chicken instead of beef.  Our waitress said it was an extra $4.99! What?! That wasn't the case a couple of years ago. Our daughter had the chicken tenders, 4 of them for $14, the chicken batter was thick like fish batter.  

We took my mother-in-law here because she has never been. Now, it's never again.

Sorry!"}
{"text":"A Tropical Escape Dinner and a Show!

This was one of my favorite stops on our Vegas Vacay. We arrived around 10pm for a late dinner and walked right in to the table we wanted. We ordered the volcano nachos (be warned, they serve 2-3 people!!!) and loved every bite. I also highly recommend their blended banana drink on a float of rum. Delicious, tropical, and everything I hoped it would be. We got to sit in the little \"boat\" section and watch an amazing band playing popular music. They were so entertaining and people were up front dancing along. I was thoroughly pleased with the food, the wait staff, the atmosphere, and the band! I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"My favorite bar/restaurant in Vegas! The music, the atmosphere, the people...! I'm a Jimmy Buffet fan and I've been to Margaritavilles all over. This is the biggest one I've seen. There's even a Margaritaville casino. I played my first slot machine here. They have live country music certain times and all the bar tenders are great. When I was there they had people on stilts all dressed up come trough. And I'm not sure if this really happened or not but some chick went down a water slide on top of the bar and into one of the giant decor blenders... Maybe I had too many margaritas. Which are delicious by the way. Always get them frozen! And if you're going to eat I'm gonna say go with the seafood Mac and cheese. I highly recommend you visit (:"}
{"text":"So if you're walking down the strip you might as well be a tourist an check it out. Super packed, not the greatest service and over priced drinks.

Margaritas were as expected, filled with too much triple sec, not enough tequila and waay to sweet. If coming here try to come at happy hour.

Food didn't look too appealing, the people next to us were complaining which made us walk a lil further for some better good eats."}
{"text":"I think Margaritaville exists only to give others what a prelude of what Hell, if it indeed exists, would be like; consuming overpriced coconut shrimp and other seafood cliches while the same four or five songs are pumped through the sound system (with accompanying video, because nothing whets your appetite like seeing senile rock stars struggling through a live performance).

The food looks and tastes like a Red Lobster menu with a makeover. It's the same garbage you've eaten at every other seafood restaurant ever, except this time the dishes have clever references to Jimmy Buffet songs in their name.

What's the difference between the \"Cheeseburger In Paradise\" and a Whopper? Five bucks.

Every drink contains sweet and sour mix. I swear to god, even my pina colada had a greenish tint to it. 

On busy nights they hire clowns and stilt walkers, who sing along to the songs and even add in their own words. Sometimes they walk to your table and shoot fake ketchup at you. At least you know why the food is overpriced, right?

As if all these crimes against decency aren't enough, if you end up having to wait for a table you're encouraged to browse the gift shop, where for the cost of your dinner you can get a shirt depicting a parrot interpreting the lyrics of the very song you've been forced to listen to all night. 

Where's a White Castle when you need one?"}
{"text":"Great way to kill some time in between losing tons of cash at the tables in Vegas. Right on the strip and plenty of room in this giant bar/restaurant. They are blasting songs from the likes of Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews and of course the man himself Jimmy Buffett. We did not eat and hung out on the front porch area while killing some time before seeing a concert. Drank many beers,pina coladas and of course margaritas. The porch is a great location to do some people watching and getting wasted as the hot Vegas sun beams down on you. I go to Vegas often and seem to always find myself here for a drink. Touristy it is...but who cares the drinks are great and honestly Vegas is pretty much an entire tourist trap."}
{"text":"I was told a 15min wait , turned out to be 45min. The food , well I had the jumbo lump crab cake sandwich and my wife had the burger. The crab cake had no crab and the island slaw had no flavor whatsoever. The burger was just so so . The music was so loud you couldn't even have a conversation. We will not be going back ."}
{"text":"3rd floor patio is a great view of the Strip. Food is typically chain food, time tested to be mediocre but good enough that it's not distracting from the fun. The only time I'd come here is if I was meeting friends from out of town.

DO NOT get the margaritas frozen from the machine. They're WEAK. Get the bartender to mix one up for you on the rocks. But that generally the case in any place that has a margarita machine."}
{"text":"Came here with friends before a concert nearby on the Strip and my friend raved about the Volcano nachos, which were pretty tasty. Definitely a fun place to go for munchies. Not fine dining by any stretch of the means, but you're in Vegas, and it's reasonably priced for standard burgers and bar fare. Claire R. was our friendly server who was very attentive, and personable. We took advantage of sitting at a table which conveniently had an outlet right by so we could be touristy and charge our phones. While we were dining, there was a kitschy performance done by the wait staff where they clapped and sang so that it was like a mini tropical Parrothead production complete with a \"mermaid\" sliding from the top of the bar into a pool of water. Like others have mentioned, you're paying for the fun atmosphere and experience. There is a gift ship and casino attached to the restaurant where you can continue your Margaritaville experience after you finish eating."}
{"text":"Good service, above average food at a reasonable price and... of course... a wide selection of margaritas.  We usually stop here our last day in town after checking out of hotel and walking around The Strip before catching our flight back home.  Between the restaurant and gift shop, it's an easy, fun way to pass an hour or so. Great location, in center of the action across from Cesar's Palace."}
{"text":"Good people watching spot, brought out the appetizer and meal at same time after 40 mins of waiting, couldn't ask what the food ETA was since the waitress told us she would be back to refill our drinks and she was Like a ghost after that statement. A different person brought out our food and she came back to fill the waters after the food came out."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a late dinner on a Wednesday night and it was great. I have to eat Gluten free and the host & waitress were both knowledgeable and helpful. I had the chicken sandwich on the GF bun. The meat was cooked perfectly and the bun was toasted but sift on the inside. I appreciate that the chef did not put any condiments on the bun. Anyone that is GF know how awful / mealy a bun can become once it has juice from meat or even mayo on it. My husband had the Rancho burger and fries, needless to say he did not leave a crumb behind. We will definitely come back on our next trip. The entertainment was excellent with people singing on stilts as well as a mermaid thing. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before a concert a jobing.com arena.  I arrived before my friend so I grabbed a table in the bar and ordered a margarita and chips and queso.  The margarita was good but oh so tiny for the price they charge.  The queso for the chips was perfect for me because it wasn't even remotely spicy.  The chips themselves were bordering on stale however.  

By the time my friend arrived there was a line out the door to get tables (it pays to arrive early!!).  We both ordered the cheeseburger in paradise.  Mine was cooked exactly as I asked for it and the french fries were actually really good (no salt or ketchup required!).  My friend ordered 2 beers while we were there and our waiter forgot her second one.  He seemed rather distracted but was friendly enough.  Not overly prompt with drink refills but he did get there eventually.

Overall it was decent, just a bit pricy.  I wish they hadn't changed their menu and taken off the alfredo pasta that came with chicken and broccoli.  That was my favorite thing there... now I'm stuck with cheeseburgers.  Oh well."}
{"text":"This place is always packed. I've never eaten here but I didn't see anything special in their margaritas. It's Vegas so everything is supposed to be ridiculous but paying $18 for a margarita was not cool. I got the souvenir glass but broke it once my friends and I entered clubs. I think it'd be more enjoyable to have dinner here rather than just come for a drink."}
{"text":"The food was ok.  It's like your typical beach restaurant.  The one dish that I really liked was their coconut shrimp.  I could gobble up a plate full of that stuff like there's no tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The nachos do look amazing but their burgers suck.  Not $15 worth.  You can get a better burger at Dennys.  The atmosphere is fun especially if drinking.  Would come back to try the nachos but not anything else."}
{"text":"Probably the best service at the last minute for any Caesars Eatery! On the 12th of February we were quite surprised, by Margaritaville Employee Dave. We were stepping into the restaurant just moments before closing. We were pretty sure we would again be turned away, with a \"sorry, no food, but you can drink here\". Instead, a young man named Dave informed us that he would be closing the kitchen in a few minutes, and wanted to make sure we would have an opportunity to order before that happened. He took our order, and served us! His people skills are awesome, the food was great, and service was awesome. If I owned a restaurant, I would most certainly make Dave the Restaurant Service Manager!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner with my fiance with some great drinks. The margaritas were fantastic, the volcano nachos were amazing, and the atmosphere was wonderful. Only issue was the waitress questioned my fiances ability to drink margaritas, but otherwise a great visit! Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to LV I stop in for their nachos.  I was very disappointed this time.  There may have been a tablespoon of ground beef on them and they weren't nicely layered as I've eaten them in the past.  Lots of chips, not much on them. On top of that, $2 for about two tablespoons of salsa?!?  It's time to find a new place to eat nachos."}
{"text":"I have been to Vegas 4 times and 3 out of the 4 we ate at Margaritaville. Our first experience in 2014 was amazing. Our trip in 2015 was mediocre and tonight's was far from that. Tonight's service was absolutely horrendous. The staff was rude, slow and abrupt. The food was good, but coming here is paying extra money for the experience, not the food. The money spent on the food did not negate the horrible experience! We will NEVER be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I've never been treated with more disrespect than by the staff here! The man who sat us at our table I don't believe understands what customer service is and the everyone I came in contact with here was very rude!"}
{"text":"Okay I love the Jimmy Buffett song so this is an automatic three to have a restaurant created around it.  Plus I mean, Margaritaville, come on!  I thought all of their margaritas were yummy.  However they come in a 12oz glass.  I can chug that before you can even blink!  They're good but small unless you get the souvenir mug.

The inside is all dim and campy with appropriate decor for what Margaritaville should be.  The waitress I had was awesome, so friendly and took care of us even when her family was there at the next table.  The staff was also incredibly friendly to Pat Baby's niece.  During the show where the girl comes out of the volcano and guys on stilts sing and interact with the audience,  they really engaged his niece and she had lots of fun.  I was also very entertained, it was just a positive and happy vibe all around.

As for the food, well I'd say the quality is like any Joe's Crab Shack or Chili's.  Don't expect anything healthy here of course, but when in Vegas, might as well be a little gluttonous."}
{"text":"Still convenient. still good. and still crackin. margaritaville for the win."}
{"text":"Just stopped in early am drinks with a view.  Always a good time here!  Will come back later for volcano nachos and frozen fruit daquiri"}
{"text":"Why do I love Margaritaville so much? I think it's nostalgic to me because I used to go with my mom and grandma and we'd share their mountain of nachos. And fifteen years later, I'm still ordering their nachos, but DAYUM, they were still great! I'd equate them to Yard House, but just piled more vertically. Definitely the best sober-up food you could ask for. I got some sort of variation of a Long Island and it was strong as hell. The bartender was a little on the defensive, since two rude people came in demanding shots when he was already busy, but once me and my pals treated him nicely, he was all smiles and strong pours. I always have fun here, and the drinks are worth the money."}
{"text":"We decided to start our night with tequila,  so we found ourselves at Margaritaville! I have always just passed this place by without a second thought, but im glad we stopped. This place was fun! Dancing girls sliding down a waterside fun! We only had a house margarita,  but it was delicious! The  food menu did not  look appealing, but we will definitely return to try more margaritas, and people watch!"}
{"text":"Margarita is so wacky! Chick in a bikini slid down a volcano into a giant shotglass and then did tricks on a giant fish hook before doing the splits on the bar."}
{"text":"I love the deck upstairs for lunch but this time in Vegas we came here late evening on Cinqo de Mayo and sat at the bar. The volcano nachos and a Landshark were calling my name. We were hungry as we only had apps at Ra Sushi and skipped dinner. It was the perfect late night snack and we devoured the huge nacho tower. Please don't share the calorie count with me- as what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas and those nachos helped absorb the alcohol so I would feel like new in the morning."}
{"text":"Less than mediocre food and the service is even worse. Not to mention they are ridiculously over-priced. The wait for the food was long, when it finally arrived it was cold. Then I waited an additional 5-7 mins for condiments (salt, pepper, and ketchup). What a waste!"}
{"text":"The bar is good, the restaurant stinks unless your used to fast good. Long waits and service is poor at best. Won't be back"}
{"text":"So disappointed ! The food was terrible and the service was worse.  Prices are very high too. The servers we're all very pissed about something.  The drinks we're $10 each and very bland with only a little alcohol. Our server Stacy was not friendly and the rest of the staff all looked like they hated life. So different than when I went here a few yrs ago. Even my daughter said what's wrong with the servers here mom. $18 for 2 gross tacos. Really. Save your money."}
{"text":"I really like this place! We had a super nice waitress who took really good care of us and the food was pretty good too! I think the atmosphere was better than the food but the drinks and people are all super nice and so much funnn!!!"}
{"text":"We got to vegas early so we hit up this spot for breakfast. Their crispy French toast is so yummy. It's covered in corn flakes and tastes like a churro. Heavenly! 

Unfortunately, they don't serve nachos until 11am and that was the main reason we went there to eat....so we came back later that afternoon and ordered the nachos that we were told were so amazing. 

3 plates of nachos and two plates of chili cheese fries. In all honesty, I enjoyed the chili cheese fries more than I did the nachos. I found that the tortilla chips were too salty. 

And a word of advice, come hungry or plan to share those plates with friends because they're HUGE!!

Good service, fun atmosphere, food that's pretty good. 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is a review for the retail store.  The bar/restaurant is your typical touristy, themed restaurant.  
I came in to get a few things for some very picky family members.  One of the managers there, Glenn saw me wondering around and offered to assist me.  I must say, he certainly knows how to provide great service.  He asked me a few questions and before I knew it he had picked out the perfect gifts for me.  I certainly wasn't expecting such great service at such a touristy place, but Glenn proved me wrong.  I wish I was treated this way everywhere I shopped.  Kudos for Margeritaville for hiring such great staff."}
{"text":"Service here is just horrible.   A 2 hour wait to be seated but most of the tables are all empty!   Management needs to address this or this place will never be able to compete"}
{"text":"Review of the rooftop bar only.
We came early evening on a Saturday to check out the Margaritaville rooftop bar in the summer. Despite being put off by the sights of a Margaritaville franchise taking over a supreme part of The Flats real estate, we never say no to a good rooftop. We made our way to the back of the restaurant where there is a hostess asking for names to go up to the rooftop. We put our names down and are told there is a 25 min wait..... what?! We are the only ones on the artificial rooftop line. The restaurant isn't even that packed. We decided to wait since we came this far and eventually make it to the top. There is no one there. The few that were up there were the usual suspects, 50+ crowd jamming to Jimmy Buffet songs. 
The drinks were strong and tasted good. The view was OK but obstructed by the bar and had limited viewing space. Why is the actual bar facing the water and blocking the entire river view? Why is the rooftop so small and skinny when the restaurant is humongous? 
Overall, would not come again but glad I got to see it."}
{"text":"This place can be so hit and miss with me. Dinner is alright, a little expensive for what you get as far as taste goes but overall it's not that bad. I usually stick to ordering drinks which makes up for almost everything else. However, I find that even though the bartenders are nice they seem to take a really long time - even when they're not that busy! It's not like this place is my favorite, but compared to the other choices in Westgate I'm more likely to go here."}
{"text":"Came here on our last day of a bachelorette vacation and I'm not ashamed to admit that we were looking for someplace cheap but delicious because our wallets were feeling the sting of Vegas.

First, the decor outside with the palm trees was surprisingly inviting and the surprise on our faces only got bigger once we stepped indoors. Inside Margaritaville are tables on boats, a volcano, large sea animals on the ceiling and way more intricate details to make it seem like you are surrounded by beautiful things on an island or tropical paradise. And we didn't expect the food to be great at all, but boy were we wrong!

Everything that was ordered was incredible. The main thing everyone should try here is the volcano nachos!! There are some great apps on the menu (we tried several) and also the drinks are just fabulous.

But the main reason everyone needs to come here is the entertainment! We absolutely got a kick out of the people walking around on stilts and making balloon animals! We had one of them come over and make our bachelorette a crown with two hearts intertwined and tipped him $5 for his time. Everyone is so unbelievably friendly and the best part?! The show!! So sometime when you are eating, everyone who works there starts singing and dancing and up goes a chick onto the volcano, (near the celling!) comes down a slide and into a huge water tank! It was completely entertaining to watch for those of all ages! And I would definitely go back in a heartbeat!

Don't miss this place on your list of things to do in Vegas! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in foe first time this year, food and drinks were great but waitress hardly seemed to care that it was my daughter's 21st birthday, completely different attitude over last year's celebration"}
{"text":"Attempted to go here Sunday night. Spoke to the hostess who told us they weren't taking reservations, which is contrary to what yelp says. She told us we would have an hour wait. This was around 7 pm. We got there and waited for a bit and then were told there was a private party at 8 and the restaurant would be closed for everyone else. Why even let us in? We ended up at Punch Bowl Social and when we looked over at Margaritaville around 845/9, the restaurant was completely closed. My friend said the same thing happened earlier in the week."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the shrimp, crab, mushroom dip as an appetizer- AMAZING! Our waiter, Gio was great. I had two drinks, \"The Perfect Margarita\" was amazingly good and I cannot remember the name of the other one, it was delicious though."}
{"text":"Not a big fan. Food is over priced for bar food. Drinks are decent. At least they have a show while you are eating your meal. The Margaritaville in capitol , California is a lot better than this place"}
{"text":"I wish staff had more energy and were more friendly.  Decor needs a major up date. While waiting for hostess to seat us I noticed a smell coming from trash and dirty dishes area on main floor. While waiting the smell intensified. It smelled like an outside dumpster would smell. As host took us to our table so many areas in the restaurant were gloomy.  I hoped for a better Experience but again staff had no energy we ordered and food was okay. Don't know if I'd come back. For the price I payed to eat here I should have left content and happy"}
{"text":"A one-star review is a rarity from me.

I was at Westgate and decided to try the place out. OK, the ambiance is decent (and it's a two story restaurant), but...eek!

The problems are as follows:

-Slim pickings. There's not much in the way of food and much more in the alcoholic department. And when there is food...
-Food that's just nothing to write home about. The only thing amusing or interesting about the chicken sandwich I ordered was that it seemed to look like a turtle, and not by design, either.
-Did I see a bird in the place? I know I saw one inside Jobing.com Arena before, but this is a little different.

I'm glad I live in the East Valley, not the West. That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"If you are looking to get really drunk then this is a good place. Their drinks are so strong they can hit you like a ton of bricks if you are not careful.

They can make you a margarita however you like, but if you want the good stuff i would recommend the Perfect Margarita. It is as strong as strong can be! Want kick it down a notch? Try the Pink Cadillac. That is a little tastier. If you are not a margarita person they got a good Bahama Mama and Tropical Hurricane. Those are my personal favorites everywhere I go. Prices here are a little high but alcohol content makes up for it.

Food here isn't all that great. I would only suggest getting the nachos. You get a mountain of food that can feed up to 4 people. Add that with your drinks and you are done for the day stomach wise and wallet wise."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and were pleasantly surprised.  My husband ordered the Belgian Waffle which came with an array of fresh fruit.  I had the classic breakfast with the bacon and eggs prepared just the way I ordered them.  Making the meal even more enjoyable was our server, Sabrina.  Her personality and attention were amazing!  So glad we gave it a try!"}
{"text":"This place was very good. We had the volcano nachos and they were the best I have ever had.  I got them without the chicken or beef, which was much better as it is loaded with an awesome chili and cheese and other toppings.  We are almost the entire plate.  We had the house margarita and the redbull margarita and both were excellent.  Our server Siandra was great we told her we had a show to see at 7pm and she was on top every detail to the end.  The only bad thing I could say is I really dont care for the half naked lady that comes out and swims in the margarita glass every hour, but to each his own."}
{"text":"Great service! Great price! Great atmosphere! Bar tender was very friendly and drinks were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great as expected! After some confusion getting to the top floor it was a great time, great atmosphere and our server Tanya was awesome! The cost was a lot higher than expected but what can you expect on the Vegas strip next to the fountains. Always love going to Margaritaville and Vegas didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"The place was hopping on a Sat evening in Las Vegas, but we managed to get a table within 20 minutes. Everyone at the table got hamburgers and we all enjoyed our meals. I also got the key lime pie for dessert, which was delicious. There is a lot of noise in this restaurant making it difficult at times to have a conversation. Every so often, they also put on a fun show with dancing and a young lady dressed in a bikini popping out of a volcano and then sliding down a water slide into a big margarita glass filled with water! Maybe not the best place for younger kids but we all had a good time."}
{"text":"In my 10 years of bar hopping, I've never had a better mixed drink than the one that Tony (from Ohio) made us! Cadillac Margaritas and an off menu Blended Banana orgasm tickled my drinking bones! Loved it"}
{"text":"Really awesome atmosphere.  I had a burger, and I wasnt expecting much, but it had great taste and was cooked perfectly.  My fiance had the grilled chicken and she enjoyed it very much.  She also had a Volcaneo margarita which was smoking, so that was pretty cool too."}
{"text":"I like to come here during the day to relax. These margaritas and any other kinds of drinks you might fancy are available. I haven't had food here, but I'm sure it's up to par with these nice margaritas. It's a tourist trap, but I am one of the tourists when I come to Vegas. Margaritaville is one of gems in alcohol heaven aka Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. But the service isn't. It took our server Jessica over 5 minutes to greet us. We've only seen her a handful of times in the hour we've been here. They weren't even busy. Plus would kill her to smile."}
{"text":"If you walk down the strip, you will for sure see Margaritaville.

I have passed by this place many many times, but last week was the first time I actually went in to sit down and eat.

If you do come here, the one thing you SHOULD order is the nachos.  This will feed a family!  It comes out in a huge tower and it really is hard to miss when the waiters bring out the platter of nachos.  They are generous with the jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream and cheese; which is why it is so worth getting!

Andrew D. and I both ordered burgers, but sadly they were not as good.  I ordered the portobello mushroom cheeseburger and he ordered the bbq bacon cheeseburger.  His burger actually tasted better than mine.  Bacon always makes things better, doesn't it?  My portobello cheeseburger was kind of lacking taste. 

Already filled from alcohol from the night before, we also didn't get a chance to order a margarita.  However, their margarita menu is extensive and it looks like there are a lot of crazy drinks you can order.

Service was a little too slow for me, but the waitress was really nice.  For 2 people, it will cost you around $50.  A little on the pricey side for just nachos and burgers.  However, I may come back again for just the nachos."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad waiters, bad food that's overpriced. Great Margaritas though! The tacos tasted like it had an affair with a heat lamp. Would not recommend unless your primary objective is drinking"}
{"text":"It's based on the chain. However I would have to say others that I have been to within the chain have been better. I ordered the trio platter with tacos, artichoke dip, chips and chicken tenders. I have to say it was pretty bland. The platter was 19.00. The drinks are watered down and have little alcohol in them. We went during the day on a Sunday so it was not overall packed. It's Vegas so there will always be a line for the restroom. The waiter was nice and overall service was good. But overall, it just did not hit the spot. It's convenient on the north end of the strip by flamingo, so that definitely brings in the business. If you are looking for something great, this just won't do it. If you are just looking for something to fill your stomach, well then this would at least do the trick. 

There is a lady that walks around taking pictures,  beware, they say it's free and will give you a small one, but of course they will show you big options with frames to try to get you to buy."}
{"text":"I always have a lot of fun at this place. I have been to a lot of the Margaritaville's and this is one of my Fav. I love the Nacho and the drinks. This is a must if you come to vegas."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food and the service. The theme and the ambiance is old and worn out."}
{"text":"A definite MUST stop at while in Vegas.  It's Jimmy Buffett's place, I mean who wouldn't love it?

Very chill and laid back place, LOTS of room.  Third floor bar(s) are cool because you get to look over the strip and watch all the stuff going on and stuff driving by.

Drinks are a plenty, order whatever you can think of, they'll make it.  Food is awesome.  I've heard the Ahi was dry but order a friggin Cheeseburger in Paradise because there's a song made after that - so you kind of have to :)

It's always a little busy but just get in there and have fun.  The staff is always nice and fun too."}
{"text":"Still waiting.  I am currently here an the service is super slow.  We have been waiting almost an hour for our food and it's practically empty!  Drinks came super fast but food is is SUPER SLOW!  Hopefully we will get our food soon.  I hate to see it when it's busy.  Good drinks"}
{"text":"We came here every time we came to vegas when I was a kid. Now as an adult who lives in Vegas, I still love it. Service is always good, food is great (portions could be bigger..) 

Atmosphere is amazing, very entertaining, especially when there is a live band!"}
{"text":"This is one of the top five worst experiences I've had at an establishment. It started off fantastic. We went up the the landshark rooftop bar grabbed only a drink each because they weren't serving food in that area at the time. Took our drinks and went down the \"the five o'clock somewhere bar\" greeted by a very friendly bartender. Got another round of drinks and understand she needed some time to put in our food order because of the other ten people at the bar. We finally got back around to us, we ordered our food. Another half hour??? later we are both finished with our drinks and still waiting on our food. Maybe they are behind we thought maybe just under staffed? Who knows. We sit for twenty more minutes with our bartender either in front of us on her phone or at the other end of the bar just staring off. We grab her attention finally and ask her to just box our food to which she replies that she didn't know what happened with our order. Doesn't ask if we need another drink she just leaves the bar for a good ten more minutes and comes back with box food. I ordered the fish tacos without fish and extra gauc instead. In my view container is three tacos with only gauc and lettuce on them. No salsa no cream. So thanks for making us pay like what 16? 18? Dollars for a no meat entree that didn't even have everything that was supposed to be one it and for horrible service. I'm empathic enough to know these things happen but like come on?"}
{"text":"Slooooowwwww service, place was not busy but had to wait 45min for food, forget about drink refills, once food arrived was average but kids Mac and cheese was cold, atmosphere is great if you just want drinks nice place to hang out. Just don't expect fast service, huge place, what's sad is i am writing this review waiting on my check another 10-15 just to get your check!!!!! This is painful"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visit Margaritaville every time we visit Atlantic City, so we felt, for good luck, we had to continue the tradition in Las Vegas.  We just went to the bar for a quick appetizer to hold us over until dinner.  We each ordered a margarita and an order of nachos to share.  The waitress was prompt in taking our order and she made our drinks quickly.  The drinks were great as usual.

It took 45 minutes to receive our nachos- by that time it was stupid for us to even eat them since we were going for a huge dinner in just about an hour.  REPEATING THEME ABOUT LAS VEGAS- EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE. We were disappointed by the speed of almost every restaurant we went to during our stay.  Other than that the nachos were great.  Piled high with all the works and yummy as usual.

We will be returning to Margaritaville in the future because its tradition and you know exactly what you are getting, but we will certainly leave more time if we visit again in Las Vegas.  Pick up the pace Vegas! I don't have time to waste- there is too much to do and see!"}
{"text":"4 stars for atmosphere and price. The food wasn't bad I ordered the fish tacos and my wife ordered the shrimp trio. Both were filling but not really all that great. I love fish tacos and eat them anywhere I go. Thought they would be amazing but the Mexican joint down the street was more flavorful. The best part of the meal was their volcano nachos that we ordered as an app. They were huge and really delicious. They are big enough to order as a meal too, they also cost just as much lol. Great margaritas too.

For being located right on the strip the prices were actually on the cheaper side. To sum it up great atmosphere, prices and alcohol. Food (except for the nachos) could use a bit more flavor."}
{"text":"Funnily enough, I didn't think the margaritas were that good here, at least the frozen ones. Oddly sour and didn't seem to be that strong.

The nachos on the other hand, OH WOW. Amazing. I don't think even four hungry people could finish those beauties. Massive but delicious.

Overall the atmosphere was fun (guys on stilts, typical Vegas), the food was good, but the long wait for our table and the drinks left something to be desired."}
{"text":"I don't know if this location is always this full, and it's kind of hard to review since we went during the fourth of July weekend. Needless to say I liked the place but thought that it would be a more memorable experience

PROS:
- The food was very tasty and came to us promptly. I ordered a Calypso Chicken Pasta and my partner ordered the Cocount Shrimp which were absolutely crispy and delicious. My pasta was very well seasoned and the portion was generous. 
- We ordered a tropical fruit margarita and a Last Mango In paradise margarita. Both tasted very good and strong, unlike other places where they get stingy with the alcohol.
- the waiter was very kind when I asked if I could charge my phone somewhere. Since there were no outlets nearby, he went to the mini stage they have and plugged it in there. He didn't have to but he saw to it that I could charge the phone while eating my dinner.

CONS:
- the place was too loud and patrons were not able to enjoy the live music being played. 
- It took us 35 minutes to get in there (again, it was 4th of July, and the place was packed, but it was just two of us so it's still a bit of a wait)
- the margaritas were rather small and a bit too expensive.

I felt like the atmosphere was different and unique but the prices are kind of high for what they have. Even though the drinks were good, there are other places that offer the same quality drinks in more quantity for less money."}
{"text":"Huge nachos, ok drinks, ok service, good crowd. I have never been disappointed while coming here."}
{"text":"Margaritaville has become our go-to place for breakfast every time we are in Las Vegas. Third floor view of the strip and the French Quarter omelette is superb. Get some coffee and a Bloody Mary and you have the perfect start to another day in Sin City. The rest of the place is fine, of course, but we prefer the slightly quieter surroundings breakfast gives."}
{"text":"Ok...  I'm a Die Hard Jimmy Buffett Fan - a Parrot Head through and through!

But...  This place sucked.  I've been to half a dozen different Margaritaville Restaurants and I knew what to expect, but this one by far failed to meet my minimal expectations.

The service is slooooow, food is canned and poor quality, drinks are weak and expensive.  The only upshot was all of the Jimmy Buffett paraphernalia and music, and I've already got a lot of that stuff.

The next time I'm itching to get my island groove on, I'll do it right.  We'll grill chicken and burgers in the back yard, put the booze in the blender, light the Tiki torches, invite 20 or 30 people over and jam to Jimmy.  More fun to set sail to St. Somewhere in your own back yard than it is to have to endure the Glendale Margaritaville.

FINS UP!"}
{"text":"One of my go to places when my guests come to town... energetic... good food, good music, servers are great... this time, our waitress was flat.... no life, no energy... took away from the experience....oh well, reflected in the tip..."}
{"text":"Pretty average food, with a Key West twist. Not ranch dressing...lime ranch dressing -- that kind of thing. The staff was pleasant, but I wouldn't say attentive. When we came in the place wasn't too busy, but there check-in setup leads me to believe that it gets packed at times. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't wait in line more than a few minutes to eat here. Not worth it. Not bad, but with all the options nearby, why wait for average."}
{"text":"The food here is your standard mediocre bar food so if your looking to dine here...skip it.  As the name implies, the show-stopper here are the Margaritas.  My gf will not leave Vegas without stopping in for one and even I approve of this one, even though I've been traumatized by past college tequila events (Go die Jose Cuervo).   Come here, order their Margaritas (I prefer blended), and have a good time."}
{"text":"Great service and environment. Food is delicious. The cuban sandwich and the sweet potato fries are one of my favorites here. Their fish sandwich is good too but sometimes a little overcooked. Margaritas are expensive but delicious. The restaurant does partner up with groupon and tickets at work so you can get vouchers."}
{"text":"Never have I been to a Margaritaville before. I wasn't sure what to expect. 

Cons first: 
Packed, but is that really a con?  It's Vegas on the strip, what isn't packed. We sat at one of the many bars so we didn't have to wait. 

Pros:
Delicious!!  We didn't get anything I would categorize as special, just some club sandwiches and fries. Oh my goodness!!  They were amazing!  
Our server was attentive and friendly. 
It was entertaining with the skits they put on every hour or so I guess.  
Clean and appropriate decor. 

Overall I'd list it as a win in vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Volcano Nachos a must have. Huge portion too much for one person. I have it every visit and this trip had it twice. Great service and music."}
{"text":"It's alright overall. The food is average, nothing too special. You can easily get better food and much better priced off the strip anywhere. This is just a touristy area that traps all those tourists that come to visit without a vehicle or know where to go. 

My main complaint is the service which was pretty bad, some of it is forgivable but a good chunk of it isn't. I won't outright name the server on here but I will definitely not be coming back because of him unless I get a friend who works here as my server. 

We came in with a party of 10 or 12, they put together a set of tables of different kinds, some round and some rectangle, like okay seriously? You can't put together a bunch of rectangular shapes and call it a day? You had to add the odd shaped table to our group, not that big of a deal we can manage. We were here to celebrate a birthday so it wasn't that big of a deal. 

We expected slow service with our group, it's normal so that's not anything I'll comment on. When the server finally came around with waters and asked us what we wanted for drinks. I ordered a passion fruit guava cocktail and someone on the other end of the table ordered a watermelon agave fresca. Not all of us knew each other as it was a birthday celebration, there's bound to be people you just met and have the birthday girl as a mutual friend so I didn't know the person that ordered the watermelon agave fresca. Our server mixed our drinks up, when the other person told him it was screwed up because she took a sip out of it, the server came back to me and asked if I had taken a drink which I answered no and he apologized that he mixed the drinks and gave me the drink which someone else took a sip out of and gave the other person her drink. Now, normally servers will ask to have your drink replaced because they messed up and someone else took a swig of it. I was expecting that, but nope he didn't. He placed the already drunken drink down on front of me and I was disgusted. Not only do I get less of a drink but I also had someone I didn't know drink out of it and he expected me to drink it? If it was someone I knew I wouldn't have cared as much.

The next thing that happened was ordering a second round of drinks, I asked for a beer, didn't specify what kind of beer I wanted and the server brought a landshark in a 20oz cup, I wanted a landshark but I didn't know there were multiple sizes and the server assumed I wanted the large size with the extra $3 charge. 

If I was being charged $10 for a drink I would have gotten another specialty drink instead of a beer, it's overpriced for a landshark. When I confronted the server he got super defensive saying that I just wanted a beer, after a few friends ordered beers, which is fine but if you made a mistake at least own up to it and not argue with me that I wasn't specific in what I wanted. The menu only had one price on it and I was expecting that price and size of beer.

His only saving grace was showing me there was another bathroom when the main bathrooms were closed. 

TL;DR version

-Bad server, I'm never going back unless people I know are working. 
-Expect attitude from the servers there who make assumptions and charge you extra.
-If I wasn't in with a party I would have walked out because THAT is how bad my experience was.
-Food is average and expensive"}

{"text":"On an arid Arizona day, nothing sounds more refreshing than an icy margarita. You may be lured in with the tropical atmosphere. You may succumb to the charming (yet repetitive music). The decor is the best to offer.

Let me spare you the disappointment and say don't eat here for lunch or dinner. Just about everything you can order here makes it taste like the poor man's red lobster, and is even more expensive. Get the bang for your buck and avoid ordering anything but the generous portion of nachos (only above average dish as far as taste and value), and the perfect margarita (only drink guaranteed to NOT be short-poured).

If you visit Westgate on a Saturday night, you may be tempted to visit again. They book some live bands who do some pretty good covers. Speaking of covers, there isn't one to get in!

Don't worry, you'll pay handsomely for that at the bar. Six dollars for a 20 oz. Coors Light? Jolly rancher shots that are 50% cranberry juice? All from bartenders who spend more time tossing around bottles of bottom-shelf swill than actually learning how to make a drink. If you're already a bit buzzed, and want some good live music with a nice crowd, this will be an ok way to end your Saturday night. Unless you talk to security...they're jerks.

1/5 as a restaurant, 3/5 as a bar/club."}
{"text":"Margaritaville is a perfect fit for Las Vegas: a loud, tacky, Caribbean-themed bar and restaurant.  Considering what it is and where it is, however, the food, drinks, and prices here aren't too bad-- and the place is actually kinda fun (if you can stomach Jimmy Buffet).

I ordered a Cuban sandwich (roasted pulled pork, ham, mustard, Swiss cheese, and pickles, served with fries: $12.99) and a \"Fins to the Left\" cocktail (margarita with some blue shit in it, on the rocks: $9.50).  The service was on the slow side, not unexpected considering how busy the place was.  

At one point, the house lights dimmed and thunder, lightning, and other theatrical elements throughout the restaurant announced the beginning of several \"live\" singing and dancing performances of classic Buffet tunes.  Oh, boy."}
{"text":"I was starving once I got here. After looking over the menu for 10 minutes nothing sounded appetizing and worth $15+ so, I ordered some french fries with a Rum and Coke. There's a pretty good selection of rum which is expected, right :) My fries came out really fast! 5 minutes tops. Good ticket time but, if the food isn't fresh, it doesn't matter. The bartender was friendly and the other patrons were full if you know what I mean lol. I came alone and they weren't too annoying. A little small talk here and there. Thank goodness!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to enjoying myself here with a group of friends about a month ago. I was even hoping it would be cool enough to host a close friend's party since she's such a big Jimmy Buffett fan. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed. 
The day I went it was cold (for Phoenix) and pouring. I actually waited in my car for a good 20 minutes hoping the rain would lessen. I still ended up sprinting across the parking lot, getting soaked in the process. This is when I discovered Westgate has no overhangs whatsoever. Everyone was getting absolutely drenched so I was eager to get inside the restaurant and dry off. 
Ha! So apparently, someone thought it would be cool if the restaurant had one whole wall that would open up into the patio area, kind of an indoor-outdoor sort of thing. That would be really cool in the summer, but not when it's 40 degrees and raining! 
Our table was only a few feet from the patio area (where they were still seating people in the rain!) and I asked several times if they would consider closing the wall so it wouldn't rain inside the restaurant and get us sick. The waitress said she would check with the manager. Yeah, they never closed the wall. So we spent our meal cold with the wind blowing all around us. 
The food was overpriced and poorly done. I ordered the Crab Cake sandwich which was way too rich and doused in some salty sauce. One of my friends ordered a sandwich that comes with sun-dried tomato mayo. When she got the sandwich, there were no mayo at all. It took the waitress three trips to remember the mayo and when she put it down we were shocked. It was green! Now, I don't know about anyone else, but where I came from sun-dried tomatoes are red. The waitress left before we could ask. Turns out it was some avocado thing instead. Then the waitress tried to charge extra for it. I'm sorry but the mayo is supposed to already be on the sandwich! Ugh!
Overall, just an awful experience."}
{"text":"Went for a work lunch. 
Started it off with the buffalo chicken dip, lava lava shrimp, and asiago crab dip. Buffalo dip was served with potato chips so they just fell apart when I went to go scoop, I didn't try the crab dip, but has some lava lava shrimp and that, was delicious. 
After apps, I ordered a margarita flight, this is 4 of the more popular margaritas: Who's to blame (original & STRONG), Blueberry Pomegranate (ehhhhh), Fins to the Left (second favorite) and Last Mango in Paris (FAVORITE).
Entree time: Beach Club sandwich. I love a good club sandwich. The lettuce was crisp, the tomato hadn't been squished so my bread wasn't soggy, the Dijon aioli sauce gave the turkey and bacon just the right kick. uhg.. I'm salivating just typing this review."}
{"text":"DRINKS ARE SO STRONG and worth it! Service was fast and our server was very helpful! Great spot to stop while walking the strip and need a refill!"}
{"text":"I came here for one of my birthday fiascos and it was so much fun. I honestly don't remember much about the food ... but one thing that I love here are the Margaritas??? NO....actually the MANGO DAQUIRI, so delish. I  would drink hose all day all the time if I could. 

It's a fun little restaurant. There is live entertainment in the form of a small production where a girl jumps into a small glass pool. It does get crowded and the lines are long, but you can always drink while you wait...and trust me you'll want a drink. 

Plus Jimmy Buffet music in the background....perfect. \"I got two pina coladas....one for each hand...\""}
{"text":"the wait for a table on a friday night was about 1.5 hours. we had a large group, but we split up to two table of 6-7 (or else we would be waiting for 4 hours!). the wait didn't seem that long since we were entertained by each other. anyways, food and drinks are mediocre. it's equivalent to a chevy's. there's sort of entertainment provided: girls sliding down a waterslide once every so often. 

well it was my first time here, and it wasn't a bad experience, just nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"This is my third time visiting Margaritaville at the Flamingo Las Vegas, the first time having a cocktail here. The atmosphere here is one that is slightly different than the one right out the doors. The bar/restaurant makes you feel as if the ocean of your choice is 30 yards right behind you. The TRANQUIL WATERS boat drink is one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had. The mangoes are cut small enough to go through the straw to give the cocktail a little texture. Great drink accompanying the always perfectly flavored Clipper Wings. All around great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is awful! As MANY of the other reviews say, the service is HORRIBLE!!! We sat at the bar outside and the bar tender was so rude! She helped the couple next to us but completely ignored us even though I made several attempts to get her attention. She charged us full price instead of happy hour prices and was rude when I asked her to change it. The manager did discount the drinks and she was nice but I dont think the experience could have been saved at that point. I will never ever go back here. It is a waste of a LOT of time and money!"}
{"text":"So...I'm the kind of person who tends to overeat and well my match was met with the VOLCANO NACHOS! 

The waitress warned me that it was a tremendous amount of food for just me and my girlfriend, but I was stubborn and took her advice as a challenge. And well all I can say is the NACHOS plate beat the Situasian.

The order is a HUGE plate of nachos drenched in CHEESE, beef, salsa, guac, sour cream, and onions. it' definitely hits the spot if you're looking for some drunchies (drunk munchies) with your friends! The plate was cheap too, about $12 for enough food for 4-5 people!

We only stopped by for drinks and a snack, and we suggest you do the same! Give it a shot if you feel like having a margi!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of Jimmy Buffett, I really like this place.

I've been here several times in the past, and have always loved the party atmosphere in the place, and also love the Cheeseburger in Paradise, with lettuce and tomato, heinz 57 and french fried potato, big kosher pickle and cold draft beer.

This last time I was there was the first time there wasn't a live band performing, I was able to watch the show where the girl climbs up the volcano, falls into it, and emerges out of it in a bikini, slides down the mountain, and ends up in a huge glass of margaritta.

I guess it is a bit expensive for some people, but overall, I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the decorations, the fact that there are no slot machines or tables in the place, etc."}
{"text":"Make sure if you order the volcano nachos that there are more than 2 of you!! humongous portion!! Along with a couple of margaritas, it's a meal in itself. Went on a Wed. night..this place was rockin'!! A fun place to go with friends!!"}
{"text":"I hate Jimmy Buffet and I hate corporate chains.  For some reason our group ended up here at the end of the night.  

There was a live cover bad, which was pretty cool and we didn't have to pay a cover to get in.  But other than that - it's a typical theme restaurant/bar.  Over-priced and weak drinks."}
{"text":"Margaritaville!

This place was pretty interesting. You really feel like your on vacation when you visit Margaritaville, hehe. 

Well well, anything else that i like about this place? Not really. I mean the service was nice. Our waitress was pretty friendly. She even offered to take a picture of me and my girlfriend using my camera. Ummm, the food could have been better. I ordered steak and chicken fajitas. The meat was a little dry and the side of rice tasted a bit funky. We ordered chips & salsa as an appetizer. I'll be honest, that was the best thing I had over there. OK my drink was delicious, but it was too expensive!

Alright honestly, I don't know if I want to come back here. It was fun and all. I guess, only come to this place if you just want to have a good time drinking and money isn't a factor."}
{"text":"Here are my ratings!

EXPECT: Big place! They have boats inside that you can sit in for food, 2 bars, good service, good drinks!
SERVICE: 5! (Richard was awesome!)
CLEANLINESS: 4
QUALITY OF FOOD: 5
QUALITY OF DRINKS: 5
AMBIANCE: Loud, bar-like feel, dark, wood.
OVERALL: We shared the nachos which were huge! The drinks are awesome! Service was great! Totally recommend!
TIP: Get Richard as your server. Simple as that!"}
{"text":"What a fun place! Came here on a Friday night with some friends, and I had no idea what to expect from a place called Margaritaville. But the live music was great, the crowd was energized, and I never thought I'd be dancing on a floor to Journey and AC/DC, but I was that night. 

Not sure what eating here's like...but if you've already got a nice buzz going on your weekend night, just roll on in to sing and dance your heart out. No harm can come of it, I promise!"}
{"text":"No need to search for your long lost shaker of salt here...it's right on the table! Well the service here was so-so, but the food was pretty good. I had a blackened tilapia sandwich and it was mmm good! The mashed potatoes were tasty as well. We also had a nice view on the 2nd floor patio. Now, I know it's 5 o'clock somewhere...but if only our waitress didn't take that to heart and take most of the night off, this place would get a higher rating from me. Till the next time I'm wasting away again in margaritaville, take care of yourselves...and each other."}
{"text":"This is an okay place to go when it's not crowded (weekdays!!).

 I've noticed lately on Fridays & Saturdays that it's the hip bar to head to. The line to get in & ID'd reminds me of Diesel.  It seems to be the go-to place since Levels closed down. The line to get in and your waist checked for weapons wraps around the side of the bar.. weird. I don't remember it being that busy before. 

Anyways, I head here on a week night when they have good specials. On the weekends, the crowd is just too packed and rowdy for a smaller space.

Our bartender was nice and their fresh cut fries were also good.  $1 well drinks Thursday 10pm-midnight"}
{"text":"First off I was  craving those pretzel sticks. Made my husband make a special stop just for those . I am so disappointed the service SUCKED they gave me the WRONG item.the waitress looked so not happy .worst service and the stupid BIG WRONG pretzel was over cooked I would have ordered something else but if I did that I may still be waiting ."}
{"text":"We were super excited to find out that our hotel had Margaritaville in it.  For a group of nine we figured it would be a good go-to spot for food and drinks.  Boy were we disappointed.  The drinks are crazy overpriced for the 1. Size and 2. Alcohol content and the food left A LOT to be desired.  The food was cheep and everyone left with stomach aches.  The place is super loud as others have said and their entertainment consists of people on stilts and a girl who dives into a blender...I guess I should use the word \"entertainment\" loosely.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I would though recommend the bar inside the Margaritaville casino - the It's 5 o'clock somewhere bar.  The bartenders have mad drink skills from the varieties of drinks they offer to the cocktails like show they put on while making your drink.  Just made me feel a little better paying $10 for a house margarita and $7 for a Corona.  If you are on the strip looking for a good, diner style place to eat go to the Peppermill down by Circus, Circus.  It'll save not only your digestive tract but also keep some of those dollars in your wallet!"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre at best. We were seated at 6:15. let the server know we had tix to see a show at 7:30 and could we make it. We were assured it wouldn't be a problem. We ordered our food and drinks. Drinks came pretty quickly. However, 7:00 came and our food was still no where in sight. Flagged down another waiter to help us and essentially got the \"this isn't my station\" response, but he did tell our server. Finally food came at 7:05. When he dropped off our food, we asked for the check, too. 
The food was just plain bad and overpriced. My crabcake gooey in the middle. I didn't finish it. The quesadilla was luke warm and the salsa was more ketchup-y than salsa-y.
However, it must be said, which is why I'm not giving only 1 star, that my margarita was far and away the BEST margarita I've ever had. I will never ever eat there again, but for sure I will be going back for a drink. 
Bottom line...skip all of the food and just get the drinks."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to go for several weeks. Finally decided to make the trek over to the other side of town to check out the shopping and the restaurants. The wait was not lawn and the atmosphere is beyond great. The Decour is very appropriate very fun and very different.

My husband had a margarita and said it was great my drink was not great asked the waitress to replace it and she replaced it with a different drink that was excellent no problems.

Our food was hot and serve very well ..tasted very good I had the teriyaki chicken with double vegetables my husband had the avocado burger turkey burger with a side salad it was all fresh good hot.

The band was fun and they were just getting started when we left would've liked to of stayed and enjoyed it a little bit longer. But there was no rush for us to get out service was great not an issue. I personally highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great atmosphere and menu items.  Food is okay -- not great with flavor.  Drinks are well made and tasty ... 

Downside:  its always packed so the wait is long and the noise level is outrageous.  

I rated higher than most would as I enjoyed the volcano and the videos/songs."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, horrible service. We reserved early for 130, they tried to make us wait till 330. So as we were dining, no refills on water were picking up. The waitress named Vanessa treated us like shit. She served us a dessert that had wax paper from the baking still inside. When we informed her of the situation she was very passive aggressive and took the plate and then had us pay gratuity! Which gratuity is only supposed to be those paying  with a group of 6 people or higher and they're having us pay more than usual. Wanna feel like you're unwanted here the moment you get there? That's the place to be."}
{"text":"Sorry Jimmy, but our experience sucked.
Came in with a group at 7pm left with hungry pissed off people at 10pm.
Servers totally overworked and no way responsible for our experience.
Kids ordered bacon cheese burger something like $16, it better be a damn good burger.  Rally's is way, way, way, better and I think, bigger.  Fries were droopy and tasteless.
I ordered a salad with shrimp, thinking I would get a salad with shrimp.  What I got was a head of iceberg lettuce the size of my fist, spit into 4ths with 2 grape tomatoes and 2 slices of cucumber, dressing and 6 very tasty shrimp.  This too was priced about $18.00  A side salad was bigger and only around 4 bucks.  Jambalaya was good, have to admit that.  Hubby's.  Table mate had to send his steak in 3 times, at about 20 minutes each time to get it medium well- came bloody rare 3 times.  Finally, he just asked for it to be made well done, and when they finally got it to him it looked like a fine pair of moccasins.  I dearly hope he didn't have to pay for that, but by then it was 10pm and we were tired and leaving."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Jimmy Buffett fan, but I do love me some Ritas! We had a late lunch last week after we touched down and the nachos were super yummy but the Perfect Margarita was watered down and rather pettite. We split some burgers that were pretty juicy, but once I browsed the touristy gift shop, I was just about ready to write this place off, but I thought, hey I'm a little grumpy from traveling (I know, it's only 1.5 hours, but still) so I'll give it another try. We decided to stop by the bar the last day we were there (hours before we had to catch our plane) and I had 3 Perfect Margaritas. OK, I should have stopped at 2 b/c the drinks at the bar are way bigger and stronger than anything in the restaurant, plus it always helps to make friends with the bartender. So, the lesson learned, skip the restaurant but hit the bar for a killer Perfect Margarita and all you penny-pinchers, remember to tip your bartender. Good tips = good drinks!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a wedding and we made a reservation for 40 people at 6:30 on a Saturday night.  Now, if that was hard for the restaurant to accommodate, they should have said so.  But instead, they took our reservation and we showed up on time.  Unfortunately, they told us they only had room for half of us upstairs and half downstairs.  Not because there was not enough room for 40 but because they hadn't set aside enough tables in one location for 40.  We seated as many people as we could together and as tables near us opened up we kept adding them to our group, one by one.  Very disappointing.  

I ordered the steak & shrimp fajitas and received steak & chicken.  They told me to keep the chicken and brought me out the shrimp, which was supposed to be \"grilled\" (according to their menu) but looked as if it had merely been heated up, not grilled.  These are probably the worst fajitas I've ever had.

But I will give it to them - they make great margaritas."}
{"text":"i came here twice this week and enjoyed my margaritas' very much. first time i got the top shelf margarita, i had two and was feeling goooooood! the 2nd time i went i had the classic one (it's got blue mixer in it)..it was really good. i had the crab and corn soup and that was heart, a touch spicy and quite tasty. i thought for 6 bucks, it was outstanding...lots of crab, nice flavor and creamy. service was ok, it's a busy chain so you definitely dont get friendly. oh well. great margaritas's and a real good soup, me likey!"}
{"text":"My wife and I finally stopped in to Margaritaville this last Thursday since we had passed it by every time we are at West gate. 
We walked up to there hostess station and there were three of them standing there talking amongst themselves with there back turned to us. I took a moment but they finally realized we were standing there. Silly girls... 

So we were seated and our server came over and asked us if we would like some drinks. My wife ordered water but had to change to lemonade because the water tasted bad. I had the tea. It was fine. 
There server came back over and took our orders and got the lemonade. I had the shrimp pasta with andouille and pepper in a Cajun cream sauce and the wife ordered the ma-hi ma-hi with pineapple salsa and rice. 

My pasta had to be to most bland tasting food I have ever had. No flavor. Pasta with butter would have tasted better. The garlic toast was the best part. 
My wife's fish was also bland and lacked any real Cajun spice and the pineapple salsa looked like they opened a can of pineapple chunks and tossed it on the fish and called it salsa. 
They were also very slow and filling drinks. 

It sucked. We wont go back. This is the kind of service I would expect from a grand opening or something. 

So left Margaritaville and went to the yard house for drinks and hung out there for about three hours and enjoyed pizza during reverse happy hour. It helped save the night since Margaritaville sucked so bad."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place out as I was staying at the Flamingo. After an hour wait I finally got seated and was starving. Ordered the bacon burger well done.... it came out 45 minutes later and was cold. Took a bite and completely raw!!!! I am pregnant and was very concerned. Took another 20 minutes for my server to bother checking on me. Showed her the burger, no apology or offer to replace. When she took the burger I thought she would come back with another..nope! She brought me the check, with the burger on it. I didn't want to argue so I ended up paying over 40$ for drinks and a burger I didn't even eat. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"This place gets high-marks from me for its atmosphere rather than its food. It's a great place to take kids with it's live entertainment and sensory-overload interior (bright lights, loud music, boat and airplane props). The margaritas are good and some of the appetizers and sandwiches are tasty, but nothing too special. Most of the menu items are typical bar food. I tried the mahi-mahi. I should have known better. It was a little on the dry side. You would probably be better off sticking to one of the sandwiches. My kid loved the kids menu which also doubles as a mask and the chicken tenders and fries he got were better than expected. Overall, it's a good place to eat for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I had a nice time here but wont be back too often unless we have someone visiting from out of town who wants to go.. The drink prices are too high for what you get. I paid $10 for a tiny cup of margarita. My friend paid $18 for a bigger one but you still didn't get enough for the price compared to a lot of other places around here. 2 of our friends decided to wait outside and not purchase anything after seeing the prices and size of drinks. I wanted to order at least 1 to try it.  I did think it tasted good just not good enough for the price. It was kind of dead in there too but maybe it was the hour we were there. We sat at the bar and just got a drink menu so I don't know about the food and might have to try that out someday. The staff was friendly and the place was clean inside. After 1 drink we decided to head to another place where we could get more drink for our buck.  I really had high hopes for this place and wish I could write a  better review but I have to be honest based on my experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a piña colada and it was nice. I would've liked it with a bit more of a coconut flavor. My friend ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the fish sandwich. They were okay. The fish in the fish and chips were salty and the fish fillet in the sandwich was cooked too much. Service we had was expected, because of how busy they were. Overall decent experience."}
{"text":"Drinks were pretty good here they had a lot of exotic drinks and the food was about an eight out of 10 for a quick bite type place the wait staff was very friendly if you're going to Vegas Margaritaville is definitely a staple fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Have eaten there twice now. Lunch took over an hour to be served food. Breakfast this weekend was fast, but the omelets were dry, as if they were precooked, microwaved or reheated. Clean patio upstairs, just poor food."}
{"text":"This is ALWAYS on our list of Must Dos in Vegas, unfortunately we didn't go this past weekend :(  The friends we were traveling with had heard the majority of the restaurant had been turned into a casino and they wouldn't go with us so we could see for ourselves.  No dancing girl coming out of a volcano, swinging from an anchor and spinning in a margarita glass?  Please tell me this isn't so Courtney G.

I was so sad we missed Margaritaville this trip :(  We normally have the Jamaican me crazy wings, and or nachos, any one of their Cheeseburgers, they ALL make me feel like I'm in paradise and one of those super fun tall Margarita dispensers.  I love it when we go and there aren't any out yet, and then after we order ours they start popping up all over the place.  It's like a cocktail that YOU can make go viral!  

Some more fun things that I love about Margaritavile besides the above mentioned is the ever fun \"get the ring on the hook\" game.  We really enjoying sitting in the awesome big chairs to finish up what ever boat drinks didn't go down with our meal and people watching.  I must like making people want what I have, because if we are lucky enough to get in a said chair, we get lots of jealous looks, and they are always occupied immediately after our departure.  I never leave with out getting some new Parrot Head swagger from the super fun store.  Margaritaville isn't just a meal for us, it's an event we look forward to, and Vegas just isn't the same to me with out it.  I wish there was one in Torrance!    

Anyway, I'm super impressed that I feel like you are going to take the time to read and respond to my review Courtney G.  That makes me feel just a special as I do when we get to go and have such an awesome time, food, and service at your restaurant.  If the craps tables weren't so mean to me last weekend, I would almost want to go back just so I could get my fix.  Alas...........there is always next time."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger in Paradise sums it up!  The burgers here are a force to be reckoned with, the servers are cool, and a it is a great value overall.

When Ryan M. and I do LV, we always hit Margaritaville for some tasty eats and drinks.  Aside from the great burgers, the tacos and nachos are also very good.

Thank you, Jimmy Buffet - every time I hear your plug for Margaritaville at the end of \"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere\", my mouth starts watering for your tasty burgers."}
{"text":"Well the service started out great. Went to the bar inside the casino. Drinks were great, bartenders lively.... doing little tricks and blowing their whistles. When their star rating dramatically dipped was when we went to the real \"bar\" where we could order food. Again, service started out great and we ordered some food. 45 minutes passes and our bartender says \"let me check on your food\" with a wtf where is your food look on his face. He comes back out and says it will be a little bit. In the meantime, people that just sat next to us in both directions got their food within 15 minutes. Needless to say, it took 1.5 hrs to get a burger. Crazy"}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas in every flavor combination you can imagine. Very efficient even when busy. Not cheap but hey, it's in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great place to go dance, drink and have a blast. The girls dress very nicely in here. The beer is cold and very cheap. I have seen Pittsburgh Steelers in here before. Casey Hampton with a bottle of Grey Goose in one hand and his shirt lifted over his head with belly hanging out. Hines Ward, Ike Taylor, Deshea Townsend, etc. Wouldn't be surprised if Jeff Reed was there too breaking something in the bathroom. The place is actually really dark inside and if you just want to chill, there are places to grab booths. Also, the Marlboro people are usually in here handing out free stuff."}
{"text":"I've been to Margaritaville in Key West. I've been to Margaritaville in Jamaica. 

Hell, I had the distinct honor to do a shot with Jimmy Buffett once. Damn right I'm going to hit this Margaritaville while in Vegas.

I ordered a burger, it was alright. I had two island lagers, they were fine. The bill was a little stupid. There was a cover band playing for about 5 minutes when we sat down for dinner. Because of that, it added another 10% \"entertainment\" tax to my bill, on top of the regular sales tax. I asked my server that if we had waited 5 minutes, would we still have been charged. She laughed, and shook her head.

Right on. Would have been nice to know that before we sat down. To add insult to injury, they didn't even play any Buffett while we were there. 

If your coming to Margaritaville to break your Buffett cherry for the first time, skip the Las Vegas destination."}
{"text":"it was okkay nothing spectacular.  I had the shrimp fajitas they were not that good.  Honestly if you have ever eaten at Chevy's and had their fajitas you know that they are just okkay, nothing special and even this place was worse then that!  But its a convenient location and its kind of a fun atmosphere. I did however try the Mac N Cheese and it was pretty decent so maybe i just picked the wrong plate. Don't know if I'd come back and try this place again."}
{"text":"This place was a reasonable walk from Bally's (so centrally located on the strip). Friendly and fun staff. Cocktails a bit on the pricey side but the food was pretty good and delivered fast for how busy it was. Good place if you're out for a walk and need a good snack."}
{"text":"When the server tells you order your food now or because I might not be back in an hour you know you are in trouble.  With that encouragement we had a couple of apps, greasy hummus and volcano wings that I think we more like smoldering hill wings.  Except for the Land Shark there is no reason to go back."}
{"text":"good food, good drinks, good location, good view. good music! Convenient location in the middle of the Strip. Wait for a table on the 3rd floor deck - the view of the Strip is worth it."}
{"text":"Best option in the area. i've known Margaritaville as a bar but never really as a restaurant. We had dinner one night and breakfast another day and both were very good. food was very good, prices reasonable and service was great. atmosphere is super fun --all in all a great option, and our new favorite spot in the area."}
{"text":"Food was ok but a bit on the expensive side... Would try just once"}
{"text":"Drinks were yummy. Soup of the day was delicious (it was a seafood chowder). Coconut shrimp were fried to perfection. Only problem was the sauce that came with the shrimp had horseradish in it. I thought it was wasabi because it has that pungent taste. It was unpleasant to say the least. Take out the horseradish and the sauce would be on point."}
{"text":"Great customer service! After I comment about a bad experience I had with my pregnant wife getting a alcoholic drink instead of virgin like we ordered. The next day I got emails from corporate apologizing for what happen. I was really impressed with our fast and understanding they were.

share the nachos!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Phoenix area and had to stop.  Had been to other locations, was not impressed before except for the original Key West location.  Expected a place with Buffett memorabilia, fruity drinks and menu items with trendy names.  Well, we got all of that along with some good food and very good service.  Portions generous, good value for the price.  Overall, fun experience and better than expected.  Probably not as good if you are not a Buffett fan."}
{"text":"Man, I came here on a THURSDAY night. We walked right in (somehow) without getting carded (but everyone was over 21 anyway, so wtf. There were empty tables and it didn't look busy, so we asked for menus to get food. THEN we were told that we had to check in for a table, and upon doing so that the wait was 45 minutes. What a load of crap!"}
{"text":"Ok... the wait time given is more wishful thinking than your actual time... told 30 to 35 minutes..  go to hostess stand aftee 45 to be told to wait another 10 to 15... you THEN wait another 20... but you have already committed your time so you wait and get screwed.. after the wait.. who really cares about the food? You eat it because you have no other option.. worst part? Walked in to use the restroom and there were MANY open tables.."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant review but a review on their abusive staff member. I just got back home to the hotel but I am still so upset about how I was treated by a bouncer/security man that I needed to write this for anyone at the business who may be able to fix the way they run things to see. I was enjoying my night & I feel very down now. 
For Independence Day fireworks my girl & I were standing on the platform where a bunch of others were also standing. Once they ended a bouncer came &  yelled at us to get down. We moved aside off the platform but couldn't get down because of the crowd. We listened the first time to what he said,moving to the side but was waiting for our chance to get down despite the fact that this guy was super rude when there were tons of others on the platform too. Next we were waiting for the crowd to calm down he got up into my ear & screamed at the top of his lungs to get down. I feel abused by the treatment we received just for standing on a platform, not hurting anyone, waiting not to get trampled by the crowd. We were completely sober females just waiting for things to calm, not like we wanted to be stuck there. he singled us out because there were others up there too but he didn't scream at them. Another reason I know he singled us out was because he asked the people sitting on the platform (oh so it's ok to sit but not stand on it?!) in a super polite voice to please move aside so we could get down. Idk what his problem was , if he's anti-women but it's enough for me to want to call the corporation & file a complaint for emotional abuse. I'm not a customer but sure as hell won't be now after that awful treatment from the bouncer. If he had just come at us in a polite or at least humane way & consider that we were waiting for the crowd to calm (I'm telling you everyone on the ground was stuck& he expected & demanded we just hop right in!) I would have understood but he's was obviously sexist or had some kind of issue. Large black male working at 9-10 pm as a bouncer/security. If you're reading this you should highly consider your people skills. Trying to blow out my eardrum is not an appropriate method to get people moving &  I feel emotionally abused. I'm not being dramatic & i understand that he may have been overwhelmed by his job but that is no way to treat another adult who is not causing any real threatening or damaging problem to their property. Shame on you mister.

EDIT *
After receiving apology via yelp I did write to the management team about my experience. I did not get a reply or a single acknowledgement that my report of the experience was received or would be reviewed. It has been about a month & a half since I sent it. Overall I will have to say this says so much about this company & it's lack of professionalism. I will not be visiting or recommending this business to anyone ever."}
{"text":"Fish tacos rock!  Sit on the third floor outside great view of caesars and the strip a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch. Our server was very nice and the food was tasty. Only giving 3 stars because the music was insanely too loud. I mean WAY. TOO.LOUD. We could barely hear each other at the table and I guess our server couldn't hear us either because 2 out of 3 orders came out wrong."}
{"text":"PERFECT margaritas!!! Absolutely recommend sitting at the top and people watch the strip. Didn't get a chance to eat from the menu, but will next time! Hip hoppin cool place!"}
{"text":"I had to stop by and get my Parrot Head on and order a Cheeseburger In Paradise. This is my first visit to Margaritaville and I had a great dining experience. My burger tasted great and my server did a great job checking on me throughout my meal.  I will definitely be back and explore the menu."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place! You will hear cool music from Jimmy Buffet, and even see some video.  It will feel really tropical with the ornate decor and kitschy set-up! Food is fine. But you don't go for that! You go for the great music, fun atmosphere, and a feeling that you are transported to a land of \"Pina Colada...\"  The portions are enormous, and you won't leave hungry.  If you have time on your itinerary, or a friend who likes a tropical flavor (and you can't make it over to Bahama Breeze), go here and get the coconut shrimp and a fruity drink.  They will feel like they are on vacation.  (Just don't expect a 5-star meal)."}
{"text":"Horrible bar food.  Nachos tasted like bagged chips with chopped tomato and low quality cheese, what cheese you could find.  Margaritas are a weak, watery & sad.  They close the patio in cooler weather instead of offering heat lamps.  Inside is dark and dank."}
{"text":"I was prepared to not like Margaritaville. I figured this was going to a formulaic theme restaurant with mediocre burgers. You typically see Margaritaville's in resort areas. This time we were at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas waiting to see an 8:00 show. Everybody was hungry and thirsty and our alternative was the Food Court.

We started off with drinks. While a margarita would have was the natural choice, I lighted on the specialty cocktails. Most were rum-based with fruit juices. I had my party face on so I went for the \"It's Five O'clock Somewhere\" cocktail. One aspect of the sweet party drinks is they go down easily. If you don't pace yourself, you'll find yourself face down again in Margaritaville.

Fortunately dinner came before that could happen!  I had the salmon with bourbon sauce. It came with rice and a generous amount of green beans. This was a good meal. The salmon was a bit dry as they left it cooking to get the bourbon sauce to caramelize but they offset it by including a nice amount of tartare sauce. The combination worked perfectly.

By now I was both sated and buzzed. At this point, the floor show started. The show consisted of two people sort of dancing with stilts. It was cheesy but fun. We lustily sang along with the chorus then had a piece of key lime pie. Everyone left with a big grin."}
{"text":"Fun touristy place to eat on the Strip.

They have this crazy volcano thing on top of the bar that a performer in a bikini comes out and slides down into a giant blender. Kinda interesting, tacky, and definitely Vegas.

The mushroom burger I had was actually pretty good. The margarita was tasty, but then again, didn't it have to be??

Good times here but not the \"must-go\" place."}
{"text":"service was sloooowwwww.. they would. not. stop. playing. jimmy. buffet. there was an annoying dude making balloon animals and walking on stilts -- seriously. 

the food was good, though..  a little bit on the priced too high side, but not so much that you feel violated.. mmm.. violated... it has been a while."}
{"text":"So kwame (spelling?) is the best bartender known to Vegas. He exceeded all expectations. He was friendly, had a great pour, and took the time to give our party of 8 helpful tips about Vegas nightlife. 

Beyond Kwame the food was ok. A few people ordered the buffalo chicken tenders. Nothing too special. I mean you can't come to this place expecting gourmet. 

We came her twice in our four day trip. We probably would've came more, but we found out Kwame would not be there for the remainder of the weekend."}
{"text":"Does not accept Total Reward Gift Cards. When the card is scanned, the receipt indicates that the card is declined, even though the card has a $50 initial balance, per Total Rewards Customer Service."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 2 stars mainly because of the food. There are PROS to this place, I didn't hate it. But as a California girl who grew up on Mexican food I can't bring myself to giving this place 3 stars. 

PROS: We were seated fast. Our waiter was knowledgeable, fast and patient. They had a LOT of different flavors of margaritas. This place is good if you have kids or parents who just want basic food and aren't into the nicer, more unique restaurants on the strip. This place is in the middle of the strip. It's reasonably priced.

CONS: The food is on the same level as Chevy's. Americanized Mexican food. We ordered the nachos. They use American ingredients to make Mexican food. Not a lot of flavor or spice. I was hoping it would be a little bit more authentic than Chevy's or On The Border but it's not."}
{"text":"I love Margaritaville anywhere I go so naturally I wanted to go while in Vegas. This time I got the seafood macaroni and cheese with a blueberry margarita. I loved the macaroni and cheese, it was delicious and it was a huge portion. My margarita was also very good and very strong. I wasn't so excited about our seating as we were placed in a table where my friend and I were seated side by side facing a crowd of strangers instead of each other. In addition, I do think that the menu is still a little pricey for the type of food they have. Minor complaints overall though I'd say."}
{"text":"I can't imagine that many people who have been here will ever return. The staff was friendly, drinks were okay... but the food & service was pathetic. I'm not complaining about our actual server - all of the people working that we encountered were very nice.  I ordered the \"Cheeseburger in Paradise.\" I had low expectations to begin with, but I have honestly never had a more disappointing lackluster sad burger in my life. I only ate about a quarter of it because I just didn't want it. The fries were also nothing special and not good. 

We waited for 45 minutes after we ordered for food to arrive - and they only served half of our group... it was another 10 min before plates came out for the other half of our table. And, my sister ordered blackbeans and asked to make sure they were vegetarian. When they brought out her order, there was a large chunk of meat in the bottom of the dish and when she showed the waitress she said \"I'm sorry, that must have fallen in there. This shouldn't have meat.\" This whole exchange just added to the overall discomfort and disappointment. 

There are too many other amazing quality options in town to waste your time and money here. It's not worth it. SKIP IT."}
{"text":"It's ok for food, I would just come here for drinks now. It's a pretty big place. Got tired of hearing the same songs over and over. I feel bad for the employees."}
{"text":"My 10yr old daughter loved the men on stilts who gave her a balloon hat and the acrobat who slid into a giant beaker full of water. Nice waiters too.  She liked the pasta with red sauce. Volcano Nachos was mostly chips and a very small amount of toppings... I saw another picture from another review with tons of toppings, I think we got Juked. Overall I think the focus is 50/50 food / atmosphere. Kind of a repeat."}
{"text":"Megan and Bernard are the best servers there! Great atmosphere and great drinks! Great place to visit in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was just sort of cruising the strip trying to figure out where to eat dinner.  It was in the 30s so most of my wanderings were inside the casinos as I made my way North.  This is where I was when I decided I was hungry.  Even though it was only around 6 most of the tables were being used.  I was seated right away and the service was generally good the whole meal.  I got a Filet ($24.95).  There was nothing great or bad about the food, the meat was medium, the vegetables were fully cooked without being mushy, I don't care for skins in my mashed potatoes but I lived through it.  The basic margarita ($8) was ok, certainly not great nor very large.

This is the only one I have been in even though there is one near where I live.  I would describe the atmosphere as organized chaos.  At ground level there were 2 stages and 2 bars and I got the impression some of the seating areas did double duty as food tables or bar tables depending on the day or time.  It was sort of confusing where the host station was unless you caught a glimpse of the sign on the front wall.  You could get into the dining area through one of the bars and there were several people who wandered in and had to get ushered over to the hostess station after they tried just taking a table or trying to share a table with another party.  The music videos were fairly loud and while it made for hard conversation it fit the place."}
{"text":"I think this would have been a five star if we'd have had the nachos and a cheeseburger. As it was, we shared a club and the teriyaki chicken. It was decent.

But let's face it-we came for the ambiance, the music and the BOOZE-and margaritaville did not disappoint! I say drink first - eat after."}
{"text":"In a city where everything is over the top and fake.  This place is just enjoyable.  Food is decent and the service is good.



Thanks jimmy!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 6. Greeted at the front entrance by Claire. She took us to our table and was our server. She was fabulous!!! She gave us great food and drink recommendations, checked on us frequently and was super friendly. The appetizers and entrees were delicious. Then the entertainment-lots of fun, especially the balloon guy. We come to Vegas often (from California) and this trip we ate at 4 different restaurants, this is the place we remember and will return to. Great job Claire!"}
{"text":"Holy cow. I've heard how certain restaurants on the strip can be iffy but I had no idea they meant \"you may end up in the hospital\" iffy. On our way out we went to Margarittaville to grab a quick lunch. I had the black and blue burger, something relatively easy and fast to make. No seafood, no extras. After we left, my head started to hurt. At first I attributed it to sinuses. But the further out we drove, the more nauseated I became. Next thing I knew, everything grew blurry and I had to get my girlfriend to take the wheel. Three miles later, we had to pull over and look for the nearest hospital. After blowing my groceries in a technicolor yawn, we were able to make it back to LA. I emailed the restaurant to let them know not to sell any more burger meat lest they have other customers get sick. I got no response, nor even an apology or acknowledgement -- even after their site said someone would contact me in 24-48hours. It's now been four days. So I thought I'd at least warn others of their unacceptable demeanor."}
{"text":"Marc Moore and Tico are awesome! Made the best drinks ever. Only my second time in vegas and I will come back here ever time. So amazing and the service was amazing. Thanks for contributing to the wonderful vegas experience!!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great. 

They have a small little area for you to order your margarita (for on the go), and the general bar area. 

Good amount of options. I've tried the strawberry one before..it's..strawberry. Yesterday I tried the raspberry..bleck. It was like, a strange sour taste. 

Bf got the cadillac, and said it was kind of narsty. 

All in all, it's a cool place to hang and chill (though that's what we didn't do.)

When I went last year, there were tons of olllldd men tryna holler at young girls from the balcony thang that they have..uhm, no."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night, the place was about half full.  Music was blaring and all the TVs were showing the music videos.  We sat at the high top tables (by the bar).  We were greeted byt the server right away.  Got the drinks and appetizer orders in.  Ordered the Wiamea Wings, because I am a WIMP!  I can not handle the heat.  Wiamea Wings are tossed with sweet and spicy chili sauce served with cucumber sticks and sweet chili dipping sauce.  They are pretty good. 

I ordered the Monterey Chicken Sandwich (Grilled fajita chicken on a wheat bun with Applewood smoked bacon and Monterey Jack cheese. Topped with lettuce, tomato and Cajun mayonnaise).  It was blah.  The chicken was just grilled, no flavor at all.  

M had the Fajitas with a steak and shrimp combo.  The meat was sautéed with peppers and onions, served with warm flour tortillas, homemade guacamole, fire-roasted tomato salsa, sour cream, mixed cheeses and Island rice.   M said the steak was good but the shrimp was not.  

So, service was great!  Food so-so.  And the people walking around in stilts was very strange like Aileen B. said.  They weren't dressed up like clowns, but people walking around in stilts.  ???"}
{"text":"Well let's just say very contrived, very predictable and very boring. The style of food is well very canned. The atmosphere is very soccer mom oriented or married man trying to say he still likes his party life while wishing someone would slowly bash his skull in so that he could feel a moment of life before dying."}
{"text":"Margaritaville is connected to the Flamingo Hilton and opens up right out onto the Strip. Obviously their theme is anything beach and Jimmy Buffet related. It's actually pretty neat on the inside. There's a section of booths that looks like the back of fishing boats. Their music is pumping for the party that's usually going on on their balcony most nights. Not terrible but it's a little distracting. Their margarita menu is large and the two we tried were well mixed. There was a lot of tequila but it didn't detract from the taste. That being said, the alcohol content did sneak up on us and we felt a little tipsy after one drink. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Next we had their chicken volcano nachos. This thing was huge and was clearly meant to serve more than two people. We picked at the plate for almost an hour and still had to take some of it back to our room. Admittedly after the drinks and appetizer we were done so we didn't have any dinner items. If you've never been I'd say give it a try. It's an expierience. However I don't think anyone would be clamoring to get back for another visit."}
{"text":"The sun is hot
And that old clock is moving slow
And so am I
The work day passes like molasses in winter time,
But it's almost July
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, and older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call her something
I think I'll just call it a day

Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a hurricane
Before I go insane
It's only half past 12
But, I don't care
It's 5 o'clock somewhere!!!


I just wish this was right up the street from where I live!!  This is definitely a favorite spot of mine when I head to Vegas!  The drinks are great--no doubt!!  But, they also have a great selection food as well!!  The Nachos will feed an army of people!!!  So, don't even attempt to eat those things by yourself or you will be lethargic for days!!   We had some peel shrimp that was pretty awesome with some delicious Old Bay Seasoning.  Another one of our favorites is the chicken quesadilla with extra guacamole.  Yum!!  

Of course, the atmosphere is perfect for what it is!!!  There's a vibe of excitement and something different.  The decor is perfect for the setting.  Overall, it's a pretty fun place that offers a unique experience!  I'll definitely back--again and again.  ;0)

It's five o'clock somewhere....  ;0)

{"text":"Casino, margaritas and beer pong! What else? 

I had a brilliant night out with friends here! 

I like the decor and the margaritas i tasted (a few of them) were really nice even so I thought they were a bit too sweet. 

The best thing for me was the cultural discovery of Beer Pong! I had never played before and thoroughly enjoyed it!! (And the look on the faces of all the lads playing who thought I looked a bit out of place with my lovely dress and fascinator in my hair ;)

As most places on the strip, drinks are expensive and it's very touristy but still good fun!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it seems the quality of the wait staff has just declined. While visiting today, our waitress checked on our table very sporadically, and was not attentive. Meanwhile, she and her coworkers joked around by the bar while we waited another 30 minutes to order....which we decided against. We asked for our check and left."}
{"text":"Friend of min es wanted to eat and drink somewhere on The Strip.
She had mentioned this place and since I hadn't even been, I was kinda excited to try it.

First off, parking at Flamingo sucks. Call me spoiled but, I guess, I'm used to bigger lots and stalls. It was kind of scary looking for parking in such a compacted space.

Second, it was a pain to walk to the restaurant because it's so far from the parking lot. We had to walk through the whole casino and then, through Margaritaville Casino....yes, they have their own casino!

As soon as we walked in, I was surprised at how big this place was. Friends that we were meeting said that it's THREE stories tall. WOW, doesn't seem that big from the street.

It was very busy as it was Saturday night but, we found a seat by the bar area. The waiter was friendly and recommended some drinks for us to start with. I ended up getting the License to Chill...it was such a pretty blue when I got it. Very refreshing AND strong so, that was a bonus!

The taco salad my friend got was huge and, shockingly, didn't seem that fattening. More refreshing than anything.
My crab, shrimp, and mushroom dip was good. Came with garlic bread but, I liked it better with chips. Btw, the garliv bread was more like garlic Texas toast =)"}

The wait was long to get a table but we were able to get a spot right away at the boat bar. Kim is an awesome Bar tender and made the experience awesome!! We will definitely be back!!!"}

{"text":"This place was amazing, it had great margaritas and live music bands. This is a great spot on the strip to stop and relax eat some good food with of course great company. I recommend the lava lava shrimp!"}
{"text":"Slow service quickly redeemed by great food. We were in this past weekend to celebrate my bday. We were quickly seated but our server didn't come around for at least 5 minutes. Finally drink order taken. 30 minutes after being seated, our food order was taken.  When I complained to the server, she alerted the manager, who came by to apologize. After that, a total 180!! Our server couldn't stay away from our table and manager came back to make sure everything was going good. Our response was AWESOME FOOD!! Then the manager Marc (?) brought out chef Tony and we could not stop gushing over our food.  The chef then found it that is was my bday and bought me a drink.  

The restaurant did not seem too busy on a Sat at 1:30pm, so I am not sure what the delay was.  But I am glad that even though we complained about the server, she was the one to bring it to the attention of the manager.

Good job Marc!  We will be back."}
{"text":"First let me say that I am a HUGE Jimmy Buffett fan.  I found myself in Scottsdale for the better part of a week, so the 30 minute drive across town to Glendale wasn't even something I thought twice about.

I wouldn't do it again; this place is truly awful.  I sat at the bar, which I normally do if eating alone, because the service is generally more attentive.  Not here.  They did offer me a drink right away and I ordered a Margarita (Jimmy would approve), but had to ask for a menu.  Bartenders should always offer a menu.  I made my selection in 2 minutes (Cheeseburger in Paradise; what else!), then proceeded to wait 10 minutes for the bartender to come back.  She and two other employees were huddled in the back of the bar talking to each other, ignoring the patrons.  I sure as hell wasn't going to yell at them over the music (oh yeah, the music sucked, but I'll get to that later).  She finally turns around to see me giving her the cold stare, and came over to ask \"Are you ready to order?\".  My reply?  \"I've been waiting for 10 minutes\".  She shoots back \"Well there are lots of use here\" with attitude.  Yeah, there sure were lots of you there, and you're all ignoring your customers.  By the way, my receipt said her name was \"Jenna\" number 1003, so yeah Jenna I'm calling you out.

Burger arrives in a reasonable amount of time, and it's also not impressive.  Just a premanufactured burger they threw on the grill.  Jenna even managed to refill my glass a few times, and was prompt when offering dessert.

On to the restaurant as a whole: It was not the immersive Jimmy experience I wanted.  While I was there, the audio/visual system played Warren Zevon, Prince, some Country crap, and Gloria Estafan (!).  Really?  When I go to a Jimmy Buffett property, I want Jimmy 24x7.  Play his concerts, there are literally hundreds of them.  Does Jimmy approve of this?  Has he seriously ever even been here?  I can't believe he'd approve of this crap.

The decor however was pretty much exactly how I think it should be.  Lots of boat metaphors and fishing equipment.  The gift shop is excellent and the attendant there was wonderful.

I'm sure now one of the managers is going to comment to this review and apologize for my experience.  You know what?  You need to do more than apologize to every single person who writes a bad review of this place.  Every single review of this place is 3 stars or less, which is pretty pitiful.  You need to get your staff to pay attention to the customers, and you need to improve the food quality and change up the music a bit.  That isn't too much to do really, as the location is good and the atmosphere is fine.  Jimmy seriously wouldn't stand for this if he knew what was going on.  So, instead of apologizing send me a free T-Shirt or something because your apologies aren't gonna do it for me as I live 3,000 miles away.  My email is e2346437@gmail.com."}

I love tacos and this is very commercialized kind of tacos...if ur looking for authentic tacos avoid this place.

Ordered the crab-artichoke dip and it was salty and to fishy/crabby. It was nothing to write home about..but it was okay to cool down and chit-chat"}
{"text":"Great place to go bring the family. Drinks were a little high but nothing to big to worry about but the menu could use a bit more options. I find the Mexican style dishes pair very well with tequila and margaritas but the menu primarily had burgers for most options. And the host during the afternoon could be removed as she seemed fairly pointless to had standing around, when I had approached to get a table for 5 she just told me I can seat myself on the high chair tables. Given that I had children with me I would assumed she would offer to seat me on the main floor where the entertainers in stilts are walking around but I guess not. Other than that very nice place."}
{"text":"We went here for my Birthday with my family. It was off the hook, the atmosphere was like you were in the Keys! Love the vibe! The staff were the best as well as the food and drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is just fun.  The decor is great, and they have entertaining staff working there.  Just get ready for a long long wait.  But I did appreciate that they told us to go walk around for half an hour and then come back for the buzzer.  They way we weren't confined to the restaurant for over an hour.

Once we did get the buzzer, we went to one of the many bars they had and got what else, but a margarita! I had the \"Havanas and Bananas\" and it was SO GOOD.  (Banana and coconut... delicious!)  It made the rest of the wait for the table bearable.  For food, I had the turkey burger that had the pineapple on top, which I also strongly recommend.  Also very delicious.  And the fries here rock too.

Really a great experience, and I would be more inclined to return to another one of these over another tourist chain like PH or Hard Rock.  The gift shop has a lot of cute things as well"}
{"text":"Our last night in Las Vegas we decided to hit up the old Margaritaville. We got there at about 10:30pm, they stop serving food around 11:45 which is awesome for late night munchies. We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender. We were indecisive on drinks, but she was super patient and helped us out, and we ended up going with the Mac Daddy 45oz blender pitcher with a frozen margarita topped with a float. You have to get the volcano nachos, they are freaking awesome, and HUGE - a great appetizer for 2-4 hungry hippos. For dinner, I ordered the Louisiana Cajun Shrimp and Grits and the husband ordered the Oven Baked chicken with Mashed Potatoes and roasted corn. 
The Shrimp and Grits was incredible. The Grits were perfectly cooked, cheesy goodness. The andouille sausage has fantastic flavor and the shrimp were large, juicy and sooo good. I highly recommend the shrimp and grits, you will not be disappointed. Hubby said the oven baked chicken was delicious, incredibly flavorful and juicy. There are some restaurants on the strip that are over priced, have horrible service and mediocre food, but Margaritaville is not one of them. The atmosphere, location and over-all experience was wonderful, thank you for a great time!

{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. 
There's so many good places to eat in Vegas but this isn't one of them. The food is just average at best and the service is rather shitty."}
{"text":"A perfect stop on a sweltering Vegas day to load up on your giant margaritas... where else but Margaritaville.  It's essentially an extension of the Flamingo's rich tropical theme. You follow the slots far enough into the casino you'll end up at the Flamingo. Its a very convenient stop if your by the isle next to Linq. You'll get a cold frozen drink to chill you out, bar food that'll stuff you, in a fun tropical ambiance, all for an affordable price that wont break the bank. This is the kind of place you can stumble into and blend right in with all the commotion and noise all around ya in this fun filled atmosphere! XD"}
{"text":"Went to Margaritaville again, and this time had the experience that I expect. I had a Caesar salad again and thankfully the lettuce was not bad this time. As always, loved their margaritas."}
{"text":"I love this silly place. It's loud, it's a bit obnoxious and the booze here is actually delicious. Wait, it sounds like my house..... anyways, I always have the best time here. I'm not much a fan of Jimmy Buffets music, luckily there was a band playing stuff I actually liked (Johnny Cash, Sublime etc.) while I was there. 
I've been here twice so far, both times I ordered the ahi seared tuna appetizer, calypso coconut fried shrimp and at least a couple pink cadillac margaritas... 
I was more than pleased with my selections because when I come back for my 24th birthday that's exactly what I'm ordering again.   :)

Update: went back on my 24th bday (12/21) and did just that! Had the same waiter as last time, he was a doll. Great food, reasonable prices we had a blast!"}
{"text":"Wasting away again in Margaritaville. Some people say that there's a woman to blame, but I know. ...It's my own damn fault.  Great margaritas what more can you say."}
{"text":"Seriously ..... What is better than drinking a margarita, eating a juicy burger, listening to Jimmy Buffett's great repertoire (/rep(r)twär/), and watching a scantily clad mermaid slide seductively (...... and very awkwardly) down a volcano into a GIANT margarita glass!!!! I ask you..... what??! Nothing. The Drinks are strong .... the music is great .... you will leave relaxed, full and drunk. 

Watch out for Pop Tops!!"}
{"text":"Another great place for people watching and consuming alcohol.  Also, bar games. or at least the ring on a hook game."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times, mainly to sit upstairs over looking the strip. That wasn't an option this time as it was closed the couple times we tried to go. We sat down stairs instead and the food was good, drinks were good and waitress was very good. The only thing I don't like is they don't play enough Buffet. They do play country and some Buffet (sounds like the Buffet Pandora station) but its maybe 5-10% Buffet at most."}
{"text":"The environment was fun and touristy! I remember coming here to dance all night but have never eaten here until now. Great service from Sabrina, who checked on us frequently. The volcano burger which I have attached a pic needed to be devoured in to four parts.  The fries were a little cold and dry. The seafood Mac and cheese which I also took a pic of was also delicious with the lemon and some pepper to add as it tasted a bit bland. But overall we had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Very fun when there is a live band and dancing. Must try the cheeseburger in paradise!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was post-Tina Turner afterglow, maybe it was the amazing company of my best buddy and sister, maybe it was the tequila and the lime... 

After the concert, we were famished from watching Tina with all of her crazy energy, so we followed the crowds to Margaritaville. The decor is as far from sublte as you can imagine. There is fake sea gull poo. There was a live band and lots of Wast Valley folk getting down. There are plastic palm trees and two over-the-top levels of Caribbean \"paradise.\"

The reason I just have to give this place 4 stars despite all it's ridiculousness and awful kitsch, is that  our server was awesome- and for me, service absolutely makes or breaks an experience. He was incredibly cool and patient which is pretty amazing considering how flooded this place gets with patrons after shows. All I wanted in the world was a blue cheese burger & they don't offer one. So, I (annoyingly I'm sure) chose a random burger off the menu and substituted all the toppings to make exactly what I wanted and the server didn't even blink. When I got my burger (quickly too!) it was just how I had ordered it, PLUS cooked correctly AND even remembered that I wanted onion rings instead of french fries.  For that moment in time, I was a very happy Parrothead.

I don't plan on making the trek out to Glendale to become a regular or anything, but it is definitely a place I would go in the future for a \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" after a nearby event!"}
{"text":"Didn't expect too much, didn't get anything spectacular.  The margaritas were good.  Expected them to be overpriced, but they were average priced.  Don't even remember what I ordered, but it was fine.  Again, nothing special.

It was an hour wait, but it was also Saturday night.  Our waiter was a nice guy, he kept the drinks coming.  He also drew a really neat cartoon of himself on a postcard he drew us.  The Jimmy Buffet music started getting to me, but obviously thats what they are going to play."}
{"text":"I went here to meet up with my friends who just arrived in Vegas who decided to eat here since they were in the mood to have some serious margaritas.  It was really unfortunate that I had to come here on a full stomach from enjoying the Buffet at The Wynn.  Worked out for me though since that gave me a chance to soak up some of their crazy drinks.  I had their Bahama Mama, which was rum filled concoction, and it was really good.  We all shared the Volcano Nachos with grilled chicken which if you've seen the pics (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw), is a monster!  It's really too bad that I didn't get to try their food here as it looks like they give massive portions based on everyone pics.  So why 4 stars if I haven't had their food?  The overall atmosphere of the place worked for me.  It was very relaxed and chill and the entertainment inside was fun and not too over the top.  Great place to eat or hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I shall call this review: DESPICABLE ME GOES TO MARGARITAVILLE.

My wife and I went to Margaritaville 10 years ago, at the time I had lived in Las Vegas for around one year. So a big part of me was still a tourist.

The food is always fine. I love the music that is played. Service is very par for the course.

Three weeks ago the wife and I returned. Afterwards I was thinking of what to say in this review.

All I could think of was Despicable Me and a few quotes from that film.

\"Gru: We stole the Statue of Liberty...!
[the minions cheer]
Gru: ...the small one, from Las Vegas!
[the cheers stop]
Gru: I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower... also Vegas.\"

Porter: We went to Margaritaville...!
[no minions here so no cheering]
Porter: ...the restaurants, from Las Vegas!

Don't get me wrong, Margaritaville is a fine place to go, but extremely touristy. 
And I didn't see and fluffy unicorns in the gift shop either.

Maybe we could sell unicorns that have Jimmy Buffet quotes like....

\"Why don't we get drunk...\"
\"Searching for my lost shaker of salt.\"
\"I don't know where I'm gonna go.\"

(long pause)

\"LIGHT BULB!\"

But I digress, have a great day folks."}
{"text":"Service was terrible and the food was worse. Cold and tasteless. I understand it just opened but they were not prepared at all. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Parking: Park in casino parking lot
Notable Food: NACHOS and Margaritas
Tip: You can get virgins margaritas if it is too early of alcohol. It is cheaper. 

Good Margarita varieties and good atmosphere to be in. The drinks can be small for how much you are paying for them. Lots of people just sitting around and having a good time. I got the Lizards drink and definitely flavorful with the taste of the alcohol 

Get the nachos and split it with your friends. It is so huge and packed with toppings. Food in general here can be pricey but hey you are in Vegas, what do you expect. You can split the nachos and definitely cheapens your bill.  

Will come back for late night snacks."}
{"text":"Let's just get this out of the way right now, the nachos rock & that's pretty much the main reason I continue to go back. I like to get an order of them once per Vegas trip.

I came here with a group of almost 15 people. I CALLED the day before to see if I could make some kind of reservation & was told that I needed to talk to group sales, but they weren't going to be back until the next day, so I could leave a message. I left my message basically just saying we were expecting a group of 15-25 people at 6pm the next night, could we reserve a table, or if there wasn't  a table large enough, at least a section of tables near eachother? I got a call back the next day (day that we were planning on GOING) at about 10AM saying, \"No, you can reserve anything, just walk in whenever you get here\" Okay, but I can't even hold a section of tables for such a large group? Apparently not.

We get there before 6 and explain the situation. They tell me the best they can do is a table for 10 in 30 mins, or some tables of 5 that aren't near each other. Neither worked. We decided to try the back bar which was totally EMPTY and had about 20 stools, so we took it over. 

We started ordering the giant margaritas with the spouts, volcano nachos, etc. People started showing up late and ordering various other things. A couple hours later the main guy that had been supplying us told me that he was getting off, so could we cash out now...even though we weren't done. I told him I guessed we could, but was rather irritated at this. They also added on gratutity, which was weird since he wa just a bartender, but whatever, it's fine. He didn't bother to ever ask or bring up the bill situation. It was clear there were a ton of people, but he just kept adding things onto MY bill, so at the end I had a $400 bill to try and break up between 20 different people. Great. I guess we must have eventually figured it out because they didn't chase us down the strip screaming STEALERS!!

End points: not great customer service for large groups, the huge margaritas were really bad this time....not enough tequila and the mix was SO strong it burned my throat, nachos are delicious (and always will be), I still will always go here b/c it's such a fun/cool place and the nachos are amazing, but would not attempt to gather a large group here again.
The end."}
{"text":"Las Vegas isn't really the idea place to come to Margaritaville. This place lacks the awesome ambiance that you can find in the Caribbean spots. Drinks are small and expensive, and the food is so-so.

 Would have all been better if they hadn't thrown in a 10% extra tax for the band playing. Listen to a mediocre band, and $9 beers became $10 beers, magically. They expect that you are quite aware of this quirk before you sit down, or else it's a nice little surprise when the receipt comes."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks.

After all the years I've protected my hearing from jet engine noise,I lose my hearing after a few hours in here from the deafening noise of the band.

132 dB at peak, well beyond that produced by turbine engines.

Thanks a lot."}
{"text":"Perfect margarita was difficult to finish. Atmosphere is fun, but way too loud. Decibels at 106. Ears ringing after dinner. Couldn't converse with party. If you want to drink out of plastic cups and dance, this place is ok. Anything else, you can do a lot better. We had to remind our waiter about our drinks. After the \"Oh yeah\" moment, we were served. Meals were already out."}
{"text":"Chain in Vegas. Food was OK, service was quick at the bar."}
{"text":"This place is a tourist trap. High priced food I can deal with when it is good. I ordered the fajitas steak and chicken combo and no flavor. The onions and peppers were not even cooked just a little burnt from sticking to the skillet. The homemade guacamole was good but the tortillas tasted like plastic. My friend was visiting from out of town and I am a local but I don't mind going to places on the strip if it is worth it. This place is not. The music was loud and the show of dancing guys on stilts making animal balloons did not impress me. My friend got the island pork wrap and said it was ok but not worth coming back for. This service was ok but not great."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with a group of friends.

Good points:
Location
Atmosphere is fun, people wanting to party
Our server was great, very on the ball
Plain margarita was strong, so I felt I got my $$ worth
Food prices were decent
View from 2nd floor of strip at night is great!

So/So points:
Very loud music, hard to hear conversations
Food is sorta blaw, felt like a Chilli's/TGIF menu?
May priority seating reservations or you will wait forever

Overall, a good time, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the east bank of the flats pick any other place, it will be better. I found the food and drinks to be extremely overpriced to the point I did not get a drink. Ordered the chicken quesadilla appetizer and you could easily tell it was frozen cubed chicken. On top of all of this, service was very slow. Appetizer came out before our waters... again, go some place else."}
{"text":"Depends on what you're looking for -- this place is very kitschy! Every so often they have dancers come in and perform stunts. While we were in there, one of them came down a slide into a margarita blender!! 

We had a great time. We wanted something relaxed and relatively cheap. Cheap eats are hard to come by in Vegas and this place is a terrific deal for the price. Their portions are HUGE! It's an ideal place to get drunk with a group of friends. Go in early. Even if there are empty tables, they have long waits (we waited for nearly an hour). Also, they don't take reservations on the weekend so you have to be prepared to wait. Just buy one of their tall margaritas and you'll be good to go!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were great but what made me decide to give 5 stars was the service! Our waitress (Morgan) was incredible! Polite, prompt and made our meal as good as it was! We will definitely be returning to Margaritaville!"}
{"text":"We were staying in the flamingo and we love margaritaville and Buffett so this was an obvious stop. We had a coupon for a free appetizer so after a long day we stopped in to get a margarita and some snacks. We ordered the volcano nachos and chicken strip appetizer as well as 4 drinks. Our server tatayana was unfriendly and very rude. As soon as she heard we had a coupon and just wanted to do appetizers and drinks she pretty much just walked away. She came back to get the rest of our order and we didn't see her until she brought the check. Other employees brought out our food and drinks and they were very friendly and nice. We saw our server stop at every table around us and ask if everything was okay but she never once stopped by us. She gave us the worst service we had all week in Vegas. If I knew she was going to be our server I would not eat here. The food and drinks were great but the service sucked. It's like she looked down on us for having a coupon and just ordering nachos and drinks, definitely not a way to make customers feel welcomed at a restaurant. 
I give it three stars because the food and drinks and other severs even hostess were so great."}
{"text":"This place is so underwhelming. Was looking forward to trying it out but the food was so so. Service even more mediocre. Overpriced. The margarita was one of the worst I've had. We complained about the speakers being way too loud at the downstairs bar and the bartender looked at us sideways. Believe me I love music at a bar but you couldn't even order a drink without screaming over the loud speakers and this was at lunch time! Not peaceful for outdoor seating at all. I left feeling like I threw money down the drain. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday after  fighting the crowd and lines at the Goodwill Career Expo. I sat on the beautiful outdoor patio overlooking the fountain, main path and stadium. That fountain is amazing!

Kaitlin was my server. She was friendly and attentive. After browsing the menu (a little pricey for my taste), I decided to order the Coconut Telegraph Calypso Chicken pasta for $14.99 and a large coke. While waiting for lunch, I read the Yelp reviews and was surprised to see so many bad reviews. Everything was going great for me...no complaints.

A nearby table ordered the volcano nachos for $14.50. That plate was piled about 9\" high with nachos and goodies. Wow! My food arrived steaming hot (a little TOO hot because I had to let it sit and cool off for so long, I almost lost my appetite) and looking yummy! The plentiful portabella mushrooms were delicious! I would order it again. I had lots left over for lunch tomorrow. That's what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"I have family in town that wanted to go here....HORRIBLE service, long wait time for food that is far from special and being on the strip I knew it would be overpriced. Very disappointed:("}
{"text":"This was my daughter favorite place. Good vibes and food. Fish tacos not bad but, the black beans a little to runny rice could of use some flavor.

Now the Fish & Chips pretty darn good, light batter and good ratio batter to fish.

Chicken salad no big deal here. The chicken Sandwich good and moist. All this and a free show not bad of a deal."}
{"text":"Quick & Dirty:  Jimmy would be very disappointed.  Just bad, all around.

Long & Wasted Away:  

In a past life I worked at a Hard Rock Cafe for a year, so I know about places like this.  They try to capitalize on tourists and nostalgia.  HRC has this down to a science, Margaritaville on the other hand is a disgrace.  

Food:  It's okay.  Burgers, chicken, salads, etc.  Basically nothing memorable.  

Drinks:  Overpriced, watered down, lame.

Atmosphere:  Would've been cool if they had been playing Jimmy Buffet!  We got to hear Nirvana, The Squeeze, Madonna, etc.  I mean, what the hell is that crap?  

Service:   AWFUL!  We were there for my Brother-in-law's 40th and were rushed along like it was lunch.  Server was terrible.  

This was my first time here but my family had been here before and kept saying \"It used to be so cool.\" or \"What happened to this place?\" or \"Why does this place suck such huge elephant balls?\"  

I don't know the answer to any of those questions.  So, I have to ask Jimmy.  

Jimmy, if you are reading this by chance, what happened?  Your name is sprayed all over the bosom of this five dollar Mexican hooker of a restaurant.  It's disgusting!  

Should you go here?  Go to Hard Rock, Planet Hollywood, or anyplace else if you need to go to a place like this at all.

Would I go here again?  Even if they had my lost salt shaker, I'd just buy a new one elsewhere that wasn't $10!

What a pisser,
Sam"}
{"text":"So we went here twice on our recent visit.  First time was for lunch.  The waiter was super knowledgeable about gluten free offerings.  He even knew which flavor margarita's were gluten free!   This was a fantastic experience.  It was also mid day on a weekday.  Our second trip was for dinner on a Thursday.  This was a completely different experience all together.  We sat at the bar to avoid a long wait for a table.  Our server took our order and brought us drinks and then vanished on his break.  We saw runners bring food out and not able to figure out who's it was.  They then asked the bartender and he put the food on his back shelf and there it sat...I don't know how long b/c it was still there when we left.  Our food took FOREVER to come out.   When it did, it was a cold mushy mess.   SO my advice is skip it for dinner, but definitely do lunch here."}
{"text":"Good was great and the drinks were wonderful can't complain the server was k. The view and ambience was on point very casual Beachy attire which I love so I got right in. Defintely will return I travel to Vegas twice a year so I'll be grabbing chow and drinks."}
{"text":"A great spot for drunk touristas and gullible locals. I have a hard and fast rule; I don't eat at places that allow, much less encourage the patrons to wear balloon hats. They have staff on stilts and the music is obnoxious. That being said, the food isn't bad. Seafood mac and cheese is killer, and who ,does not like a shot of tequila or five? If you don't mi d a circus like atmosphere, drunk touristas, and aren't scared of balloons give it a try. Tell em Jimmy sent you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I didn't eat here, however the ambiance is of this restaurant is very up beat the bartenders are very attentive and friendly and the drinks are so yummy I ordered a Banana-Mango Rita frozen and our bartender name was Dani ... she was awesome!!! Def check this place out if your ever in Vegas ..."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place 5 stars only because I feel bad I kinda threw up on their floor... 

I'm really sorry, Jimmy. I was really trashed!!"}
{"text":"For people who hate chains -- you'll hate this place.  Sorry about that.

However, this place is one that I continue to come back to every time I'm in Vegas.  I love the fun atmosphere and the good music they play.  I like that it makes me feel like I am really on vacation.  

The food is decent and is not insanely overpriced like some places in Vegas.  The food is also consistent.  I've never had anything bad here, but my favorite is the chicken fajitas.  

In the time between my trips to Vegas, I discovered they have added a \"show\" at this location.  Every half hour (I think) a girl comes out and dances around and does a little shimmy shake.  She even climbs into the volcano and then slip and slides down it into the blender.  It's ridiculous and hilarious, but totally awesome because it is in Vegas."}
{"text":"This review is only for the margaritas. 

Wow! So good I don't care about how calorific it is or how hung over I will be after 4 or 5 of these. They are just that good!! 

I think if you are in Vegas and it's freaking hot out, you gotta have at least one. Especially the frozen ones. Not as much variety of tequila as El Jardin at Santana Row (Bay Area, CA) but still good quality margaritas."}
{"text":"Horrible service, walked in and waitress said 25-30 mins. We walked up to the bar sat down and looked down on all the open tables. Sat at the bar and seen the same open 12 tables for 25 minutes. This is a Saturday and clearly management don't give a crap what is going on. We have looked at this table for 25 minutes and it hasn't been cleaned off. Don't waste your time with this place, its all about the \"NAME\". It's horrible, go to one of the local spots don't spend your money here, this place sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Reason:
Wandering the strip, and my sister had heard this place was pretty good.

Bueno:
The food is really good for the price. Everything on our table was delicious!! Nachos, cheeseburger, steak and shrimp...frickin' awesome. I didn't drink, so I don't know how the alcohol was.

No Bueno:
The waitress was pretty shitty. She could've learned to smile JUST a bit and took a good long time to take care of us. That, and I really don't care much for Jimmy...and his music got old by the time we left. I can't imagine working there and hearing that music ALL the time."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the food was great! I did not have to wait at all to get seated, and I was with a group of 4 people. 

We were seated next to the window, which is great for people watching because who doesn't like to do that especially on the strip!?

I enjoyed my chicken fajitas and the margarita slush was really good. I ordered two and got a slight buzz from it. The atmosphere was awesome, and so was the music!"}
{"text":"This Place always has decent crowds so we decided to stop in and see what all the noise was about. The food waa good with great portions,  service is questionable and could be much more attentive. The portions and quality of food would bring me back."}
{"text":"Breakfast is over at 11am which kinda sucks. Lunch only starts at 11am, so if one person wants breakfast and one wants lunch, you're SOL. That being said, we ordered the nachos which were underwhelming. The coconut shrimp was REALLY good. I had a watermelon margarita which was really good and my friend had one drink that was served in too warm of a glass which made the ice melt quicker and her drink taste watered down. Be aware of that when you order drinks! The service was just \"okay\". We had to go find our own plates to share the appetizers as our waiter disappeared and each time she came by, she asked a quick question and then left so fast that we didn't have time to even answer everything."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Margaritaville. I've been to Vegas many times and ALWAYS make it a point to grab some grub and margarita's while on vacation. 

The Nachos are scrumptious and I love love love their bacon bbq burger. 

The bar area is fun and entertaining as people are always passing though to get a drink - last time I was there we stayed for a good 5 hours drinking and eating and met a bunch of fun people and are planning a reunion soon. 

I recommend the Perfect Margarita - but only if you have a love for tequila. It's got a kick to it - but definitely does the job!"}
{"text":"I have to come here everytime I visit Vegas. Best nachos I've ever had, and they are huge! Also amazing margaritas. Make sure to sit on the roof deck, it over looks the strip and has an outdoor bar. One of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for lunch while staying in Vegas for the weekend. We were staying at the Flamingo, so the location was very convenient for us. I've been to a few different Margaritaville locations, and this one is definitely the coolest (but also the most expensive).

We got the nachos to start, and they were MASSIVE. Between, the 4 of us, we could only eat about half. I got the beach tacos for my entree, and they were good - a nice light lunch option. My favorite part about this place is the drinks. I got the last mango in paris, and it was delicious.

I would definitely stop here if you're going to be in Vegas - it's an experience!"}
{"text":"Take me away again to margaritaville...just know I won't be leaving the bar! I had the perfect margarita on the rocks with salt and ummm-err-ahhh it was perfect. I found the bartenders to be personable, friendly and willing to make suggestions. 
The hostess staff however, has some control issues. They take their job and power very serious. The server I had, while a seasoned server - was surprisingly inept with a large group. No refills, VERY VERY slow food service and she must have put the order in wrong as the food runners started delivering to the wrong people and then just started calling out meals. There were fajitas, burgers, wings, etc on the table and she didn't bring any extra napkins or make a trip over to see how we were doing. So the service was eh, so I got my own napkins and refilled my own iced tea - was the food good? Yeah the food was good, I had the turkey burger and it was full of flavor and goodness.  Would suggest you come here for the bar and atmosphere, and eat at the bar too."}
{"text":"Meh.

Don't get me wrong... Jimmy Buffet can be my friend. But Jimmy, let me tell you I won't be wasting away... or my money... again at Margaritaville.

Service was iffy... the food was even more questionable. A worse-than-cheezy cover band tried to \"entertain\" from the stage.

The only good thing? I snagged a postcard out of our bill folder and sent it to my mom. She was thrilled to get a postcard from me in Vegas, so I scored some points in that area at least!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great service, great people, live entertainment, clean and safe.  Day 2 of opening day during the soft launch and they did a perfect job !!  Rooftop bar was also cool, a nice look over the water..  :)  :)"}
{"text":"i had so much fun here!!!!! i love the margaritaville slot and casino theme. the dealers were so nice and fun, and it's really a party atmosphere and not like a serious gambling spot. 

i didnt eat here but they DO have a veggie burger (not sure if it's vegan!) but i have to say the drinks are great and it's a fun place to hang out"}
{"text":"You know, I never understood why Parrotheads get so excited about Jimmy Buffet.  After my first visit to Margaritaville... I still don't understand. I get it, it's a way of life or state of mind, a way to cut loose... but continuous videos of tailgating at Jimmy Buffet shows, with Chesney or Wilson thrown in every 10th video? Not for me. I'm sure a lot of people find this place to be like a little 'cheeseburger in paradise'. The atmosphere is kind of fun, but with a quoted 'one to two hour wait time', at a place that will not do reservations or call-ahead seating, it would be nice to have bigger bars to kill that wait time. The food is not bad. I will say the Volcanic Nachos were like manna from heaven, after we got seated, stacked THIIIIIS high with lots and lots of 'penos. My fish tacos were nothing to write home about, and the side of 'paradise' or something of that nature rice was... rice with carrots and peas. Huh. I have to say, though, I did not feel ripped off. The food wasn't stellar but at $10 for a good-sized helping, it was decent. My friends ordered other things and I really did not hear any raving. One person's steak was still mooing, after ordering it medium. 

Service was really, really good. I wish I could do a separate 4 stars for the staff, they were awesome. I never had to ask for another drink, and our guy was incredibly patient while we waited for the rest of our party to show up after we had been seated. We did not feel rushed at all, and that means a lot in such a packed restaurant where others are obviously waiting still. They split our check without batting an eyelash. I tipped accordingly, you should too. These guys were facing a mosh pit with smiles on their faces. The balloon guy on stilts was a hoot (ask him to give you crabs if you go) and the live band was classic college alt rock, about 5 years after college. No one danced, which I thought was pretty funny. They didn't sound too bad. 

Definitely a place for Parrotheads or those into doing the trendy theme restaurant thing. :)"}
{"text":"Had a great time here for our last night in Vegas. The bartenders were nice and really attentive. We listened to a DJ who played all the jams and the set would change between him and a live band, which was also really fun to listen to and dance. If you're looking for a chill time and not something crazy hectic then this is the spot to be at."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink on the strip.  We went there on Friday night and it was Packed.  The crowd is 30+ and older.  The bartender was very friendly and the drinks are great."}
{"text":"A must stop for us every time we're in Vegas.  I always get the Island Lime Cooler and the Stranded on a Sandbar (both are no longer on the drink menu but the bartenders can still make them).  My fiance sticks with his perfect margarita - it's basically a tequilla martini. lol  

Beware the nachos (in a good way)!  They can feed an entire army.  And if that wasn't enough, you can add chicken/steak to them too.  

IMO, the menu lacks some quality and variety, but I mostly come here for the drinks.  

Very disappointed that they no longer do the shows or play videos of Jimmy Buffet concerts.  Boooo.. dropped my rating to a 3 because of this."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is a must visit every time in Las Vegas. Great Bartenders!
Especially Erin! She is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Usually everytime I got to Vegas this spot will be the first night chill spot to get settled ...the drinks are good & the music is good too they have a live band at first you think theyre a bunch of old men this is a place my parents would party @ but then they start bustting out jams from today's hits ..hip hop r&b pop...whhaaattt!?! Everytime I go here sometime good happens last time I went I won a dance contest & got free drinks all night & their margaritas are pretty bomb!! I suggest this place if youre wanting to settle the first night & have a good time to start things off ......"}
{"text":"I liked the chicken quesadillas at Margaritaville. Very cheesy and meaty. My friend had the beef ones and it was awful. The guacamole was bland. I don't know why I ordered a cuban from here but I did and it was just average nothing to rave about. Everything was pretty much average no major complaints I didn't leave regretting my experience"}
{"text":"I recently visited Margaritaville to grab a couple of drinks with a friend, and I have upgraded the place from \"I don't want to go there\" to \"I don't mind going there.\"  I'll be honest, I'm not crazy about the place.  The house band is loud and pretty cheezy IMHO, but everyone else in the world seems to enjoy 'em.  The bar is always super packed, hence next to impossible to get a drink.  And the prices are pretty hefty for being just a shitty little bar.

Why the upgrade?  Well, on the Tuesday night I went, it was pretty empty.  My friend and I found seats at the bar and had a very friendly bartender who was able to assist us in charging our drinks to my friend's room at Harrah's.  Kind of a cool Harrah's perk, I guess.  Great place for people watching on the patio, too.

If it's my choice, though, I'll pick a different spot to go eat or drink at."}
{"text":"Not busy, and horrible service. Barely any TVs to watch football, unless you like 20\" screens. Went to the restroom and it was trashed with garbage everywhere. And very over priced, along with not a lot of food selection. Good luck"}
{"text":"As a young 20 year old, I love coming here. I've spent several fuzzy nights here eating and drinking. The food I did not enjoy that much, not a big fan of a sesame bun I guess... 

ONE of the reasons I love the place is obviously their relentlessness commitment to Jimmy freakin' Buffet. Everything screams Jimmy Buffet. But that is all obvious, the MAIN reason I come back to this restaurant is because they have one of my favorite places in Vegas.... In the main bar up front there is a fairly small balcony/outdoor area. Its about 3-4 feet above the strip's sidewalk, with a railing to lean on. In my opinion, the best place in Vegas to people watch. Just low enough to see the faces, just high enough so that people wont hit their heads on your beers.


 Some of the best times of my Vegas life have been talking with my friends on that balcony and yelling at pretty girls as they walk by. 

**small tip. Get a Loaded Corona not a Loaded Landshark. Corona bottles have longer necks, fits more tequila."}
{"text":"We were there on an off day, like Tuesday after New Years.  Place was dead.  BUT, drinks were good.  Good was good.  Environment was neat.  Las Vegas.  It didn't blow me away, but met expectations."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Margaritaville tonight before the hockey game despite my better judgement as I have been there several times before. Waited 30 minutes and did get a decent seat outside to watch the crowd. The waitress was pleasant but as usual the food was just not that good. I ordered a Cheeseburger that was just 'so so'. The bun was not toasted and the cheese had not melted. My son had the Coconut Shrimp. It was cold and just not that appetizing. I just think that from a well-known chain like this, the food should be better. Lots of other options at Westgate, plan to try something different next time."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch in our anniversary while staying at Bally's. We both enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. Both of our burgers were good, but the Key Lime Pie was definitely the highlight! Reasonably priced and good service. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible here. We told the hostess it was our first time here and she sat us outside, and it was cold that night and I had no jacket. There were people smoking at an outside bar that was making me ill. When I asked about the smoking they said that there was smoking on the outside patio, when asked to be moved I was told that it could be 45 minutes to an hour wait. So we stayed. 

Mu husband ordered the cuban sandwich and I had a burger. We also ordered drinks..I got the chambard margarita and he had a jack and coke. Food was expensive for what we got and the portions were very small. My drink was horrible and made me feel sick after I drank it, the husband says he swore they gave him crown and coke..and was weak as all hell. 

I was baffled that this is Margaritaville and they serve the drinks in plastic cups...WHY???? I was expecting a fun or fancy glass. I was sad.

Not impressed at all with this place...and would not really want to go back, just don't see any reason to."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Las Vegas, I make sure I hit this Margaritaville. This last trip was amazing. We were in a hurry to make a show and our waiter, Danny was top notch. He got our food out to us quickly and accurately and he was warm and friendly. Spectacular!"}
{"text":"Our server was nice, theming is off the chain but it was otherwise blah. Overpriced basic food, nothing special. Margaritas are all sugar couldn't even finish mine (and I'm in Vegas and didn't finish that one drink) 

And on top of that people kept coming in and trying to seat themselves and then got caught and asked to wait in the lobby. Where was the seating hostess? 

Also have to go to the bathroom? Nope a male worker closed the bathroom for 10 minutes to clean. While a line of us waited outside to use it. The place is huge and it's only 3 stall bathroom? 

Idk 2 $10 margaritas 
I appetizer
A salad and a beach club sandwich came out to $80

Not worth a 2nd time."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Went on a Tuesday night and waited over 10 min to get a waitress at our table. Just got up and left! Place looked like a ghost town!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. Beautiful day, patio open and place fairly busy. Nice open layout that is extremely spacious and sprawled out. 

I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich for $15. Prices across the board were expensive and it is unlikely that you will find a meal here for less than $14 minimum. Kind of a turn off for me given chain restaurant.

The food was ok. The chicken sandwich was definitely over-priced for what it was. The fries did stand out as above average - they were light and crispy and came with the sandwich.

I wouldn't come here again for food, but they have a nice patio for happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"My first visit was late in the evening on my first trip to Vegas.  It was a Monday night and the place was absolutely dead.  We were so bored that we barely made it through one drink.  

My second visit was much better.  We went there for lunch and sat on the rooftop area.  The view was excellent, the Margaritas were fantastic and the atmosphere in general screamed Carribean vacation.  It was what I was looking for the first visit.  I think the key is to go when you can sit out on the rooftop and soak in the rays.  It likely helps them sell more Margaritas that way too!"}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for mediocre food and mediocre service.

The decor is amazing though. And a lot of the other customers made our experience fun. (People watching)

We split a burger and a pasta dish. Both were good, but not amazing.

And our margaritas? Not at all what you'd expect from a place whose name suggests they specialize in them. 
They were majorly weak. Not cool.

I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and slow service. I ordered the steak and the only option they had for vegetables were green beans. Also ordered a frozen margarita and it tasted like it didn't even have any alcohol in it. The waitress was nice. But again the service was slow. Seems like an Applebee's type restaurant."}
{"text":"I Love Margaritaville usually come here with friends family. Tonight is Tuesday 11:15 pm June 19th, 2018 . My party and I have been sitting here for about 20 minutes with no greeting from server. The server literally walked around and past us several times . The busser greeted and apologized and was very friendly but just asked us to wait a while longer . Finally been greeted and server took our order after 23 minutes. Was not satisfied with customer service, food was excellent though."}
{"text":"Omg I love this restaurant, great chicken tacos & the atmosphere & service are outstanding, will always be a stop for us when we go to the strip!!"}
{"text":"Great (but not strong) margaritas. Average food and ambiance. I have tried most of the frozen margaritas here. Mango is the best. Wildberry is solid too. Pomegranite is average. Lime is average. It's a tasty margarita, though for $7 it's a bit overpriced for the lack of alchy inside. The food here is nothing to marvel at. The jerk salmon and sweet pork sandwich are solid. The broccoli and chicken pasta is unremarkable and overpriced. Their hourly margarita volcano is lackluster. A decent lunch on the strip, but I think I'd rather go elsewhere in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great drinks, decent food! Live music is always a plus. Get there before the crowd does or you'll be waiting awhile."}
{"text":"I went here last Monday at 11:30am and had one of the best Bloody Mary's ever!  The bartender made it exactly as I wished-nice and spicy and because of that I got two!  He was really nice and friendly, my bf and I enjoyed his company as well.   

The decor of the place is fun and typical Jimmy Buffet, just what a tourist wants on vacation!  I didn't see any shows or anything because it was early but still had a nice lunch.  There are also some seats outside in the front for you to catch some rays as well as heat lamps for when it is chilly out in LV.  

I ordered a chicken jerk sandwich which was good with fries!  I also appreciated the large thick paper branded napkins they had.  

There are also lots of photo opportunities inside.  I took a picture with the large green-boozinator?  

Def worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Me and my fiance wanted a cheeseburger. We came across this place and wanted to try it out. This was an fun place. The drinks were good. The food was ok. We had traditional wings and that was pretty good. Then had a bbq cheeseburger. The burger meat had a funny taste. This place had a show and a woman who would spin around on a hook. I would recommend this place to have a good time."}
{"text":"The food is so-so. Burgers are dry and super salty. The fries taste good - fried very close to perfection.
The entrees didn't look very appetizing and the service was meh."}
{"text":"I've been to about 5 of these now.  This one is the biggest.  The best?  I still think Myrtle Beach is the best.  Very nice inside and a great location.  The Flats have really improved.  The food has always been good here.  It's pricey, but you should understand that before arriving.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Another adventure with a coupon. THANKS FIANCE. We had a deal from TravelZoo that was 2 Meals, 2 drinks for $35

Initial reaction: This place is touristy. At 2:30pm it is jam packed full of people. My fiance says, \"When in Vegas, people don't care about eating at normal times.\" Ok, Ok, I will give you that. 
 There was a long wait for a regular table, so we find a place at the high-top tables in the bar area, which is open seating. We snag a 6-person table for the 2 of us. We felt kind of bad, as we saw a larger group giving us a death glare but we were hungry after a terrible breakfast we had earlier in the day. The noise level was very high. I was sitting right next to my fiance and it was difficult to hear him.

The service was definitely slow, but I didn't see many servers in the bar/high top table area. Maybe they didn't expect it to be so crowded that late in the afternoon... Who knows, but we didn't see our server very often except to bring us our awful drinks, mediocre food, and finally our check. She was very nice, but I think she was spread too thin.

Those drinks though... Margaritaville LOVES sweet and sour mix. OMG, yuck-o-matic. Neither of us could drink them. Come on bartender, take it easy with the heavy hand. Ain't nobody gettin' tipsy off that.. diabetes maybe.

We ordered the Southwest Chicken Salad and the Cheeseburger in Paradise. We always split our entries so we each get to try a little bit of each item. The cheeseburger was pretty good, I think.. I have been on a diet for a while (#sheddingfortheweddingyall), so I could have just been craving something meaty and greasy. It did come out cold though, so it was probably sitting in the window for a while. The salad was ok, I didn't like the dressing that was on it so we ordered a side of ranch. I think it was a vinaigrette of some sort. Nothing particularly spectacular about the food. It was satisfying."}
{"text":"5 star frozen Strawberry margarita, 2 star food. Got the shrimp skillet as an appetizer, broth was entirely too buttery so everything was buttery, greasy and tasted the same- like butter. The volcano nachos weren't hot and weren't special."}
{"text":"Service was beyond slow and they kept blaming the kitchen for being slammed. Waited over an hour and half for nachos, and they were soggy!!! Beyond disappointed and would tell everyone to stay away from this establishment as they clearly do no know how to run a restaurant. This place will close within a year!"}
{"text":"This place can really put on a good show, plus good food! Excellent performance from the staff for making the guests feel very welcome. The blended chocolate vodka and rum drink was very delicious and not too strong. The fish tacos that I ordered were really delicious as well as the rice and beans. Although for $20 I was expecting a little more fish on the tacos, but otherwise it had nice flavor. I'll have to come back here and try some other meals from the menu."}
{"text":"Waiter, um, there is an exotic dancer in my margarita.
Oh, excuse me? That giant 10 foot tall swirling margarita directly behind me isn't for consumption? Damn. 
I feel as if Vegas brings nothing but mental and physical exhaustion for me. I was so tired on the day of our arrival, i didn't even put the whole Jimmy Buffet theme together until a pirate on stilts walked by me. 
Decent 'ritas ( I liked the top shelf margarita myself) and the food was plentiful and comforting. 
I was a little disoriented by the large Mr. Buffet or occasional Jack Johnson towering above me on television screens, but it was the \"chick on a hook\" that dropped down into the Megarita behind me that really caught me by surprise. 
The men were happy with the location choice, but I could see other females around me not so impressed with the \"bleach blond in a bikini on a fish hook\" almost twirling her way into my burger buns.
I'd probably come here to get drunk fast, but it's really not my kind of joint unless surrounded by an equally drunk and silly group of people. It's definitely Vegas, very chill and encourages one to keep on drinking."}
{"text":"In our three visits to Margaritaville, we have never been disappointed. It is such a party atmosphere with lots of friendly people and the wait staff is outstanding. We've eaten on the third floor patio and inside the building, it just doesn't matter. All fantastic. 

Due to an unfortunate series of events last night, this morning I am drinking iced tea. But, it's great tea!
Thankfully, we picked a time with a small crowd and limited noise. 

Not feeling terribly sophisticated this morning, I decided we should split a Southwest chicken salad and grilled chicken strips. The salad is out of this world with flavour. Plenty of sweet corn, black beans and fresh avocado. Maybe it's me, but even the greens seem fresher today. I would really like the dressing recipe, sweet yet not overpowering. 
The chicken strips for lightly breaded with almost a fish batter taste. My favourite part was the light and tender fish inside. Not too crunchy and not soggy or soft. 
We asked for all three sauces and they were fabulous. The barbecue sauce tasted like it had a littttttle bit of alcohol in it. It did not. The honey mustard was very good as well as the ranch. 

Paul L. Was our server and he did a fantastic job. He was friendly as hell and he kept the glasses filled, you know I love that."}
{"text":"After visiting Vegas so many years I finally had the time to go and check out this place  with my family. Upon are arrival we were greeted with a friendly smile, and where told that we can sit our selfs any where we'd like. Once we sat our selfs we waited 10min!!! for anyone to acknowledge we were their. We got the attention of one of the many servers, We asked for a menu 5 min after asking she brought the menu. After that we never saw her again bad service weak attention to customer service It's very poor no floor manager presence, there's no sense of leadership."}
{"text":"Wasted away...in Margaritaville.  Was searchin' for a good time and all I found was drunk folk!  Some people claim there is Sin City to blame, but I know...it was all Jimmy Buffett's fault!

TOURIST.  TRAP.  In the middle of the desert.  Mr. Buffett, you have no shame!  But this lack of shame (and the act of being high & lazy most of the time) has made you a very rich man.  You're rich, B!+ch!  Your tropical concoction of a so-called restaurant called Margaritaville is definitely to blame.  You and Kenny Chesney doing a duet anytime soon?  I will be sure to rock my big-rimmed cowboy hat, a tight tank-top, Bermuda shorts, some sandals, and my ukulele.  I want in on some of that moolah you make by pandering to your beloved 'Parrot Heads'.

Seriously, Margaritaville is like the tropics gone loco!  It's like Nathan Drake of Uncharted fame crash landed on a deserted island run by...um...Jimmy Buffett.  Damn, couldn't find a better metaphor!  This place is like a mish-mash of tropical and kitsch all rolled into one!  It's akin to being in on one of Jimmy's LSD induced hallucinations.  Although thinking about it, that might have been the goal.  Margaritaville is probably the place you want to be if you love island living (I'm from Maui but geez this is stretching it), think that all island-dwellers wear brightly colored Aloha shirts all times of the day (most of us actually run around shirtless with spears and use ti leaves as cloth diapers), and have no sense of time (actually, most of us Filipinos don't have a sense of time).  Also, if you love the song 'Margaritaville' you will probably love hanging out at Margaritaville.  I swear, for the hour we were there eating dinner, we heard the song play at LEAST 5 times!  Insane!  And yes, each time there was a bikini-clad woman sliding down a gigantic margarita glass-shaped slide into a pool below.  Drunk, frisky men were in awe (I might have been a little bit in awe as well but that was out of respect for the bikini-clad woman...a real gentleman gives credit where credit is due).

Margaritaville was quite the experience.  Upon being greeted at the host stand, we were showed to another host stand downstairs.  Now for me, this is where the night started.  It is normal to be greeted by an African-American teen, sure.  But being greeted by an African-American teen with, \"Yo dawg, how you doin'?  Four?  Right this way.\" while dressed in khaki shorts, a bright turquoise Aloha shirt with parrots on it, and sporting a bit of a gangsta lean?  Kinda hilarious.  It was a bit like being shown to your table by one of the members of the Wu Tang Clan.  In the middle of the tropics.  But hey, who am I to judge?  A kid's gotta eat.

However, we literally were sat right in the middle of the entire restaurant!  It felt like each table around us was like 10 feet away.  Luckily our server was nice, but a tad on the unattentive side mainly because...we were seated 10 feet away from everyone else.  It's like she had to make a mini trek to get to our table.  

The kids were amused with Margaritaville for all of 10 minutes.  Ooh, an airplane!  Ahh, a slide!  Ooo, palm trees!  After that, eh.  Then all the questions.  \"Why is it so noisy in here?\"  \"How come those people are laughing so loud?\"  \"Why are they playing this song AGAIN?\"  \"There are lots of salt shakers here.  How did they lose it?\"  I don't know kids, I don't know.  Go back to drinking your margaritas.  

The food at Margaritaville is interesting in concept, but I think the execution comes out as MEH.  Really on the average side.  We came here mainly because the kids wanted to share a round of Margaritaville's famous Volcano Nachos.  This $16 behemoth really did resemble a small volcano!  Ginormous!  Easily could feed 5 people with a mound of tortilla chips topped with chili, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapenos, tomatoes, and green onions.  But honestly, anyone can make nachos.  They tasted okay, but not the best nachos I've ever had.  Chili kinda tasted store bought.  Biggest peeve?  I hate when I have too many nacho chips but not enough cheese!  This volcano of a nacho pile had hardly any cheese when you hit the middle!  If I wanted plain chips I would have asked for plain chips.  It's like that one guy at McDonald's who makes your soft serve cone in a swirl with a big pocket of air in the middle.  Bastard!  

Rest of the food there?  Overpriced!  Come on, $13 for a cheeseburger?  $20 for coconut shrimp?  It's expensive to live in paradise!  Not much different fare than your local chain restaurant.  But the drinks do look tasty.  Besides Volcano Nachos we ended up just ordering two cheeseburgers off the kids menu.  Nothing special.

Margaritaville is open daily, 365 days a year for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Just the way you would figure a crazy island in the tropics.  You can have your island fever fix just about any time of the day.  Just don't forget your sunglasses and your SPF 5000.  It's still Vegas after all!"}
{"text":"We had a very good meal the fish and chips they gave you five pieces of fish and chicken fajitas were delicious lots of chicken"}
{"text":"Spent a lot of time here on the last trip to Vegas, good times!!

They have really good Pina Coladas.... however expensive but they're worth it!  Gotta love a place with more than one bar, a dance floor, restaurant, and a store... so much going on! 

The live band was good and played a wide variety of music.. there weren't too many people gettin down on the dance floor though, but once we got the drinks rolling it was a good time!  

They have this weird lil game right before you walk into the store with a metal ring on a cord... I can't get it to work to save my life... 

The store has so much cute stuff I found it necessary to blow some money in there too =)  Saw a guy passed out in one of the adirondack chairs in the hallway... take note, do NOT sit in a really low adirondack chair if you are wearing a skirt/dress... bad idea! 

Funniest thing is, I hate tequila, we are not friends but I had a great time here anyway!  Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a friend whom advised to get the Volcano Nachos, so I'm totally rating this  place specifically on that. The service is okay and I'm sure there are some good items on the menu, needless to say I didn't bother with the menu and told the waiter to bring us the 'volcano nachos', they were not the worst or best tasting but unfortunately we had plenty of uncheesy chips left over and since I didn't bother with a menu I didn't see the cost until the bill arrived and $17.99! Okay definitely not satisfied even if it had cost half that amount. So not only was the nachos mediocre but way over priced even if they give you a large quantity."}
{"text":"Sitting here staring at the hostess waiting 35 minutes to be seated after I made a reservation on Open Table which they are NOT honoring. What ever happened to \"the customer is always right?\"  You are probably wondering why I just don't get up and leave? Great question... but it's all about the principle.  The Manager said they are not affiliated with Open Table and they need to correct that. Well that's all good but don't do it at my Expense. I have a reservation. Ok after typing this I'm leaving. Staff are assholes like Jimmy Buffet!"}
{"text":"Good food and drink every time we go - fun view of a drunken dude getting his wallet pick pocketed from our view of the flamingo/linq corner window (no way to alert the guy, we were too far from the exit), but the waiter warned us of them!  
I enjoy this place, I'll be here every trip, I just won't get a picture with the skanky cop girls outside."}
{"text":"I've only been to Margaritaville for drinks on weekend nights. Or should I say I've only \"tried to get service here\" on weekend nights. The whole place is lackluster and plain, besides the giant tornado margarita near the entrance. I've never actually gotten service here because every time I try to, I wait in excess of 20 minutes to get service from the bar. The last time I was at the roof top \"land shark\" bar. They were not busy at all for East bank bar standards and I was with four friends standing at the much less than half full bar. I waited 15 minutes, the whole time trying to grab one of the 5 bar tenders attention. It wasn't until we all turned to leave that someone tried shouting to ask what we'd like. Our minds had already been made to leave. I would NOT recommend coming here for drinks. That's all I can really speak on."}
{"text":"Jimmy! Jimmy¡ Jimmy! The service here was horrible. And we never made it to a table. They asked us to wait for a table. Well. OK.  10 minutes not so bad, even though there was 30 empty tables.  Not enough wait staff. Okay. But after waiting 10 minutes, they seated us at a bar in the dining room. Really? We could have sat at the empty bar in the lounge at any time.  I was really ready to share my smile, but, after that we hit the sidewalk for the PBR Rock Grill"}
{"text":"Love this place! I come every time I'm in Vegas! Great atmosphere, service, food and drinks! The volcano nachos are HUGE and delicious! Great entertainment for all! Marcie our server this evening was amazing! She went above and beyond her job and made our visit exceptional!"}
{"text":"Funny reading the below review from the same day that I went (Cinco De Mayo) because my experience was the complete opposite! LOL! MAN! Did we have a blast visiting Margaritaville! I'd say if that Bill T. guy was partying at the 5 O'clock Somewhere Bar with us than he would of for sure had fun too! This location is HUGE so I can see how you would get different service depending on where you sit. Also Billy the Bartender made the experience much more enjoyable.

We pretty much walked into the first Mexican themed place that we saw which just so happen to be Margaritaville. Sat down at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender Billy. His energy is off the wall! Brought out the energy in us! LOL! Of course we ended up partying with the people we were sitting next to which became 1 big party. Awesome atmosphere. Almost every person that I saw hanging out in there had a huge smile!

Billy the Bartender suggested we try the FRYCHOS basically nachos but with Fries, which weren't anywhere on the menu but I was able to request for it from the kitchen for the same price! They were the BOMB! Def hit the spot for my hang over! We also ordered shrimp skewers that weren't the best & very overpriced. 

The drinks were tasty buuuut more so STRONG!

All the staff I came across was outstanding!

Thank you Margaritaville & Billy for showing us an awesome Cinco De Mayo! We definitely will be back to party again!! :)"}
{"text":"I have to say, I really had a great time at this restaurant!  We started off at the bar, and had a margarita.  Yeah, they are a bit pricey, but man, they were worth it!  Then, we were finally seated, and ordered drinks at our table (after we finished our margaritas)..  Then came the insanity.  We ordered the nachos as an appetizer, and I swear it could have been a meal for both of us.  The platter was HUGE, and the nachos were overflowing the plate!  It was amazing - and they tasted very good too!

The rest of the food was excellent too.  The burgers and the chicken were spot on!  And it was fun to watch the insanity that goes on around in this place.  I think this place is better off for the atmosphere itself, but the food does not take anything away either.  It's plenty different from all the other restaurants on the strip, but if you are looking to have some fun, and a good meal, how could you go wrong in Margaritaville??

....wasting away in margaritaville....."}
{"text":"The only reason I wanted to come by - the volcano nachos.  I liked them a lot.  Shredded cheddar and jack on top of a mild chili mix of ground beef and stewed tomatoes, sour cream, guac, tomatoes, and jalapenos.  Only thing I DIDN'T like was the fact that there weren't enough toppings to go around.  By the time you get to the middle of your \"volcano\" there are only nacho chips left with nothing to scoop.  We sat in the bar area because table seating was a 15 minute wait.  Pretty good bloody marys."}
{"text":"This is a cool place with good food. It has a n ocean theme. There's a big boat with tables on top. The floor has a water pattern to it. Booths made to look like he back of fishing boats. There's a giant sea plant hanging from the ceiling too. They have a stage set up for live music as well as a projector and screen for videos that play along with music when a band isn't playing. Now for the food. It's pretty good I've always gotten the rancho deluxe burger, but I'm a burger guy. My dad usually gets the French dip which he likes. I was here with someone who ordered fish tacos and those were good as well. The servers are pretty good but some could use some retraining. One person refilling my water spilled all over my iPhone. Understandably I wasn't happy and she didn't help by immediately asking if it still worked. I got lucky since she spilled right on the speaker on top so water could have easily gotten inside. They have a store next to the restaurant where you can get anything you want with the Margaritaville logo as well as barbecue sauces and different seasonings. We usually bring some back to my brothers. Just beyond the store is he Margaritaville themed casino in the Flamingo. It's in a good spot on the strip too, you can easily walk here or park in the back and walk up through the Linq with all the shops. This is a cool place to hang out and grab something to eat."}
{"text":"Dear god the margaritas are crazy sweet. I remember this place being so much better but then again it was my 20s. We ordered the nachos which were delicious and huge. But dude the margarita I got was disgusting. I asked the waitress which margarita is the least sweet. She said the perfect margarita but when I got it..... it was super sweet and not a repeat order. I'm not a big sweets person so I thought maybe my pallet was skewed but my coworkers complained about the same thing."}
{"text":"This is a great place! Our server was super friendly. The food was fantastic! We went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We had the fish tacos and the black and blue burger. Although the fish tacos were fried, they were very light tasting. The rice was ok but the black beans were very good. The burger was juicy and, again, light tasting. Great fries too. The atmosphere was so chill and pleasant. We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Some call it a tourist trap..  Maybe they're right.  Been here about 5 times when I didn't live out here.  Since I moved here, been here only once.  Yep, I was trapped. 

Food is okay, nothing to brag about.  However, their Volcano Nachos is probably the best nachos on the strip.  Only came our here for the nachos and drinks.  

You get some entertainment while you're here.  Once the song \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" comes on the party starts.  All the excitement last about 15 minutes.  Not bad and it really can be entertaining.  However, after about an hour and seeing the same routine 3 times, it get's a bit old.  

Not a bad place to have a few drinks.  But for food, not my first pick in the area."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time in May, 2012.  I had the fish tacos and a perfect margarita, which was one of the best I've had.  The prices were decent for Vegas.  I would def go back!"}
{"text":"The service, drinks and food that I have had here tonight have been exceptional.  The waitress wished me a happy birthday, recommended a few items from the menu and was very attentive to the us as she walked throughout the restaurant.  We ordered volcano nachos as an appetizer and the infamous margarita tower for $70.  The nachos they brought to us were loaded so we got pretty full while enjoying the margaritas.  The general atmosphere of the place was welcoming and the self seating was a plus.  This would definitely be a place that I visit on my return trip to Las Vegas.  They also have really unique booths inside the restaurant that are designed to look like boats.  If you go for food, you should either have a big appetite or just go for either an entree or appetizer as the servings are well over normal portions you would expect to see at most places.  Keep up the great work, you've got an out of state regular now."}
{"text":"This place is a bit of freak show. Picture your neighbours down the street - the ones who park their car on their lawn next to the old bathtub and parade around in black socks and sandals with Hawaiian shirts open to the bellybutton. Now imagine what kind of restaurant they would probably own... whatever you imagined is probably something like Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville Café.

The place is loud, music videos always playing on the big screen, most of which are live performances by Jimmy Buffett in his Bermuda shorts and flip-flops, and it can be difficult to have a conversation. We had to holler our order at the server. At one point in the evening, we were all interrupted to watch a blonde chick in a pink bikini ride down a water slide into a giant cocktail glass which was followed by a short dance routine by people in costumes on stilts telling us to put our hands in the air. Seriously. When I'm at a restaurant, I don't want to put my hands in the air, I want to eat and be left alone.

Which reminds me, they serve food too. I had the sirloin steak which was disappointing. It was really thin and kind of tasteless. It was about as thick as a slice of toast. Not worth the $22. It was like something that would come in a TV dinner. I'm probably spoiled living in western Canada with all of our great Alberta beef. Yum. Shortly after the meal, my stomach felt upset. Could be a coincidence.

We just wanted to get out of there after our meal. I felt like we were intruding on some secret society or cult and I just wanted to give them back their privacy. I'm giving Margaritaville two stars for the food and four stars for the decor. They really are unique, I'll give them that. Not my kind of place."}
{"text":"The location is great and the scenery is nice with the boat, TVs, fishing rods, funny quotes on the walls and tables and  lastly very spacious. I just stopped in for a light snack and cocktail. I had the Shrimp eat n Peel nicely seasoned and my drink was decent minus my sugar on the rim (no biggie.. just don't ask me then return with a sugarless rim ) as I was attempting to leave I did have to ask the waiter 4times for a Togo container.. I got up and asked the bartender..all in all decent place I'll just try a different time next time ."}
{"text":"This review is just for their brunch. We were starving and not willing to walk too far so we opted for Margaritaville because they had a sign outside saying they had breakfast from 8am-11am. 

We knew we'd be eating throughout the day so we split a steak and eggs. We asked for medium rare but really for $18 I wasn't expecting much. The steak came out well done and a little on the thin side but hey you get what you pay for. The meal itself was your normal steak, eggs, has browns, and toast. 

All in all, this is a great place to go if you were too busy getting plastered next door at 5 o'clock somewhere and need food or risk a gnarly empty stomach hangry syndrome."}
{"text":"Came here while our vacation here in Las Vegas. Walked in and the hostess gave us a receipt (ticket number) to take up to the waiting area she could've been a bit more friendly, or even smiled at-least.  So first impressions were ruined. A very friendly lady walked us to our table about 3 minutes later and we sat in the boat tables. The menu were pretty easy to follow but this place is really not worth how much they want to charge for simple bar food. And the drinks don't even taste alcoholic.. The wait time is pretty long. The food portions are okay. Taste could've been better. Overall I've gone to better Margaritavilles. This place is not somewhere where we would return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend nearly lost it when one of their gogo-dancers slid down the side of the volcano, landed in a giant margarita blender, and was then raised up by a giant fish-hook where she spun around for 20 minutes.  Then again, I nearly lost it too.

This place is AWESOME- and the price is definitely right, especially for Vegas.  From the pirates, fishermen, and sailors walking around on stilts, making balloon hats for the diners, to the decor (ships and nets everywhere, signs telling you the distance to every tropical land in the world)- it's impossible not to have fun!  The drinks are strong, the company is good, and the wait is never impossibly long.  Give it a shot- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"MARGARITAVILLE IS LIFE!

What more can you ask for with three bars (4 if you count the indoor-outdoor 5-O'Clock Somewhere bar!!!), lots of food, and tons of awesome drinks.  It's Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  And it feels like VACATION!  I FEEL LIKE I'M AT MYRTLE BEACH!  Or the Siesta Keys...

Get a Zombie or a perfect Margarita and just chill out!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few different Margaritavilles around the country and this one is by far my favorite (some of the others are actually rather mediocre). It's always busy (AKA festive) and a great time. My favorite place to sit is up on the 3rd floor balcony overlooking the strip. As far as the food goes,  I'd recommend the nachos and the \"cheeseburger in paradise.\" Food that I wouldn't quite recommend: Ahi tuna, crab/lobster dip (it was mostly cheese). 

As expected, the margaritas are fantastic- just take a peak at the first page inside the menu and you can see all their signature creations. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"We tried this place this time in town and we both ordered burgers. I was very suprised and the quality of food, I guess I didn't have high expectations... like everywhere in Vegas i believe it's overpriced but the food was good. The decor and staff seemed great. I would go back again when we come to town. Very loud inside so hard to talk in a big group."}
{"text":"I've been here now about four times. A lot of people are giving it bad reviews. Have to give the place some slack, it is still getting footing in Cleveland and opened up recently. 

The place is massive! They did an amazing job at really utilizing the space. The decor is wonderful and typical Margaritaville. It's exactly what is expected and it's really a breathe of fresh air to see this in Cleveland. It's a sign that we are on the up & up having an establishment like this here. The half indoor, half outdoor bar is my favorite spot. It's the best place to people watch and has a very energetic atmosphere to it. The other bars are fun too and are also inviting.

Service can be slow at times but I think it's still just trying to work out the kinks in the system. Everyone I've had so far has been super friendly, apologetic for wait times, and does their best to check in. I haven't had any major issues at all yet and I've been there when it's been swamped.

The food is good. It's not mind blowing compared to how man other amazing places there are in Cleveland. It is a little pricey for what you get but that just comes with the territory I'd say with a touristy chain. I'd say it's solid though. I love the chicken tenders, jambalaya, and the nachos. 

Drinks are delicious and flavorful. They aren't strong but there is a nice variety to choose from and fun glasses you can have with the drinks as well. I like to stop here and just get a nice chilled shot of tequila before heading over to Magnolia for a show sometimes. Will actually be doing that tonight!

Anyway. I'm super happy we have a Margaritaville in Cleveland now. It's great for the area and really brings more people down into The Flats which is always a positive. Give it a chance!"}
{"text":"Excited to re-visit Margaritaville in Glendale since we hadn't been back since last year.  Obviously we ordered the wrong thing....from reading reviews looks like everyone should just order the Nachos and call it good.

Well, we decided to branch out as it was my hubby's birthday and we were there for dinner, apps, drinks, the hole nine yards.

Well, after getting a couple of drinks and the Spinach and Artichoke Appetizer we decided to move on to another restaurant for dinner.  The appetizer was $10.95, which we figured would be pretty good sized.  Wrong!  We got about a half cup of warm spinach in a cream sauce, could not detect any artichokes and the dish was only half full....oh, but we did get an over abundance of chips....enough for oh, let me see, a full dish of dip!  Something was really wrong.  Would have mentioned this to someone but no one ever came back and asked until we were done and ready to leave.

But, it was a birthday, and my parrothead had been promised a trip to the gift shop so off we went after paying almost $30 for 2 drinks and a half an appetizer.  Only to discover the stock in the store was very low.  Everything we wanted was in someone else's size!  Asking the clerk about that we were informed that the store was using a different warehouse and that they expected a large order any day now.  Oh well, I'll just order him something online.

Probably won't go back.  So disappointed as last year we had a great time there at least twice and now the prices are higher, the menu smaller and the service  was just the essentials....nothing over and above."}
{"text":"Second stop of Birthday night, and I was already feeling my 22 years creeping up on me and telling me my old butt needed to be in bed.

I didn't dance here, but the music was alright, and the live band wasn't too shabby either. No cover always makes me happy, but I expect to pay nothing less than a million dollars for a single drink that I didn't even taste the alcohol in or feel as the night went on. Interesting crowd mix here, I had a guy probably in his late 40's ask me if I wanted to dance with him. He didn't \"look\" like the type of guy that normally hit on me, so I shied away from his offer. 

Once again, nice crowd, no fights or jealous glares which makes me all the more happy. Sad to say though, general tiredness had me leave at 12:30. I had had all that I could have had and was ready to kick off my 5 inch Jessica Simpson's and call it a night! Who knows, if I ever make it back out to WestGate I may have to stop by and see whats poppin' at Buffett's."}
{"text":"My wife and I just came out for a few margaritas no food. We were fairly disappointed to say the least. We have had Margaritaville in a few other states prior, so we are very familiar with the establishment. To be fair all we had was a Bama Breeze and a Mango Margarita. The Bama Breeze was ok could of use a little more flavor, but our favorite Mango Margarita was very disappointing. It was just a regular frozen Margarita with just a splash of Mango. And we had to mix it so it blended together."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after reading that they now serve breakfast.  Glad we did!  I had the Belgium Waffle with fruit, which was delicious.  My husband had eggs, bacon and toast, which were prepared well and to order.  While not cheap, it was a nice breakfast treat.  And server Sabrina was friendly, efficient and sweet.  Couldn't ask for more, and she made the experience that much better!"}
{"text":"They gave us the darkest table in the place. But the rita's were flowing and I forgot about it. I had the cuban sandwich. It was great, but I think he lost half of it on the way to the table. It was cut in half. O.K. Who has the rest of my sandwich? Then we went and got a picture taken with the parrots. Woo hoo!"}
{"text":"I will always make it a point to stop at margaritaville when the opportunity arises! It's a fun place to listen to some jimmy and have a nice frozen drink. 
I had the Havana banana frozen drink and I was in love. It was very filling but so good I couldn't stop sipping!!! Also, they have a dedicated gluten free menu and gluten free buns!! I was excited about that! The service seemed slow and the servers were a bit careless just meandering around but at least we had some island tunes to distract us."}
{"text":"Went to the Cleveland Margaritaville recently on a Saturday. The wait for a table was an hour and I get that, its a new place in the flats. The place is huge though and could easily fit a dozen more tables in there. We got lucky though and got a seat at the bar. The girl who was working the bar had just started that day so we were a bit concerned but she did a great job nonetheless. Our problem was the food, waaaaay overpriced! I was a little shocked when I saw then menu. We paid $16 for nacho's and they were terrible. By terrible I mean dump some chips out of a bag toss a bit of cheese on em and call it done. We asked what appeared to be some sort of manager if this chip pile was as good as it gets, he replied with I'll get you some more cheese, which he did. We decided to leave after seeing how expensive the menu was. We don't mind spending on going out to eat but I'm not paying big $ for a chain restaurant cheese burger. 

My suggestion, stop in for a drink before you go next door for dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food, good service and great prices. We always go when we go to Vegas... Love the coconut shrimp and fries ;-) Also the artichoke/spinach dip."}
{"text":"Nasty. Cold fries, soggy burger that makes a Big Mac look good. Amazingly they couldn't  even get the margarita right. Overpriced in a town where that is expected. and not the cleanest place I have ever been to by any stretch. Jimmy you ought to be ashamed."}
{"text":"This review is strictly rated on its over priced food and disappointed. 

Every time my cousins and I come to Vegas we always try to stop at get the \"Volcano Nachos\" well today happened to be the day. keep in mind we have been stoping here for the last god knows how many years to just get the nachos and drinks one beers. However, the \"volcano nachos\" arrived to our table looking quite empty. Seems like all we got were a bunch of chips a scoop of chili meat and it was blah.... I remember this appetizer being a lot more filling and worth the $18.00. My nephews were even disgusted with how it tasted and kids love nachos. I'm very very disappointed that a Vegas tradition has finally reached its end. In addition to that we our salad came at the very end of the dinner but our server was very nice and removed it from our bill."}
{"text":"Awesome shrimp app, volcano nachos sucked!  Cold and spoonful of meat and guac.  Really good server, idiot at host stand.  Too much trend and not enough attn to food"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary date...thought it would be a cool new place for us to try out, but boy was I wrong! Service is TERRIBLE!!! Took use 20 Minutes to get waited on after we were seated at our table. Then I took almost another hour for us to get our food after we placed our order! I'm sorry but this restaurant's performance is sub par. If you're looking for a new place to try out, please look elsewhere."}
{"text":"A shout out to our awesome waitress, Jennifer Hales, who provided incredible service!  Good food, great ambience, fabulous margaritas!  Highly recommend the margarita flight!  Your fans, the Birthday celebrants from the bay area.  Jennifer, stay away from the whiskey...  :-)"}
{"text":"The food here was decent, and decent price for Vegas.  I had their mushroom burger.  

They have a waterslide inside, where a half naked chick slides down as they sing a song.  That was interesting."}
{"text":"This place was awesome went here for the first time and had the Volcano Nachos and they were AMAZING!! and the Tropical Hurricane was delicious and totally worth the money."}
{"text":"Horrible! Giving it a two for the cute ambience. Overpriced horrible food. The ribs have an odd barbecue flavor that is not good, and the cole slaw tastes sour and bad. We complained and were told that is the way it comes but the kitchen would be told. I ordered fajitas for $19 and was offered cheese, fajitas don't come with cheese usually though.  The pitas were served folded on top of the meat which made them soggy and gummy. I ate the chicken and peppers alone. Don't eat here, you deserve better. Our check came and it was for another table. Is this a way to get $50 off me and to have two tables pay a $120 Check instead of $70. And the service is bad even though there are a ton of workers. The band is to loud during the day you can't even talk."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Vegas, so of course I wanted to try out Margaritaville for dinner. My husband and I each ordered a burger and fries along with a margarita. The burgers were awesome but we were both a little disappointed with the margaritas, I expected them to be better. It was all pretty pricey for what you get, but the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was fun. We will stop here again on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Really not that good. Strong doesn't equal Perfect (Margarita).  Jambalaya okay, not great.  Wait staff going through motions.  Spend your Vegas dollars elsewhere ."}
{"text":"Margaretaville is a good time stop for a quick pub meal and entertainment.  Had the blue cheese burger and it was better than I expected from a tourist oriented restaurant. It was actually moist and flavorful! Our server was friendly fun and fast. While we were there we had the opportunity to see costumed singers and the girl in a bikini take the plunge down the volcano slide into the large margarita glass.  Great place for Jimmy B fans, couples, and singles. More of a place to have a meal and a couple of drinks and head out; not for a long night of hanging out. The outside balcony is a great people watching spot on the strip. Maybe not the best place for the 10-16 age group because of the volcano show."}
{"text":"Fun, relaxed atmosphere & delicious drinks / food. We always pop in when we visit Vegas. Have been disappointed to see the recent menu changes (they removed my favorite - the fried chicken cobb salad) but the margaritas & loaded landsharks are still great. We had the volcano nachos last night, no onions (allergy) & when we realized they did indeed have onion, our waiter Ken removed them from the check & was very apologetic. Margaritaville offers the service & manners lacking in so many other restaurants around here, & we love the accepting, friendly vibe. Hoping to see them diversify the menu a bit as it feels more generic now...& bring back the Cobb!"}
{"text":"This is a stop we make during every Vegas trip. Being a Parrothead, we have to. 

Margaritas are excellent, the food is mostly good (Crab Dip - Very good; Jerk Chicken - good; Taco Salad - not). Service is good and the atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"One of the BEST places to go in Vegas, hands down! The bartenders are awesome, and just KILL the flair! Especially Billy - just incredible mad skills!

Must go - we hit it every trip. Sitting here right now as a matter of fact."}
{"text":"Great service from our waitress & the waiter she was training! Very personable and outgoing and gave great recommendations! Highly recommend sitting in Dana's section. Not giving it a 5 star because the one hostess was not very nice or friendly, and she's the first person you see when you come in. Also, they wouldn't sit anyone outside if you had a group larger than 4 people and it's a beautiful night out so that was disappointing. All of our food was very tasty and the drinks were strong and delicious! Live music Friday night's is really good!"}
{"text":"We came here as my birthday lunch while we were in Vegas celebrating my birthday, our drink was pretty watered down but that may have been because we let it sit. The food seemed to take a long while to get to us, but it was delicious. Our server was friendly, but again our service was very slow.

I'd eat here again though, maybe it was just a busy busy time. Plus its a pretty popular location in Vegas. Maybe service is always slow. Who know, but the food was good."}
{"text":"No conch fritters - no crab sandwich (they took them off the menu) and no Buffet music - Jimmy what the hell? Extremely disappointed on this trip, sure we'll be back, but come on Jimmy!"}
{"text":"The name really explains it all. Great place to go before a sporting event or even for a night out with friends. Great authentic Mexican food and not to mention who doesn't love free chips and salsa !?!"}
{"text":"Awesome ritas great food and music!  50 bucks for 2 drinks and 2 burgers. The price you pay in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"The place wasn't full of people and the show was decent. I wouldn't say it would be something to go out of your way for. What really makes this a standout location is their margaritas!!! Hence the name. 

I ordered the blue chill margarita which was the BEST margarita ever. I wanted to order ten more. It only comes blended, which is the way I prefer the margaritas. The ice was very well blended and stuck together. I am so sad that there aren't like margaritas in Southern California like that. I can't wait to go back to Vegas to order this unbeatable margarita. The prices are fair as well."}
{"text":"Ellen was our waitress, and she was the ABSOLUTE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Don't even come at me about that. What more could you want from a place like this? Excellent service, strong drinks, great food, and beautiful women. Follow Chuf Fitness for more in depth coverage. Overall was a FANTASTIC experience, will go there every day from now on!"}
{"text":"I got the volcano nachos and those were great, shared with 4 other people and we got full. They had a special for tequila shots so we all had a mango tequila shot which went down smooth and was actually good. The food is pricey so if you want to spend at least like $15 on food then go for it. You can share if you would like. We parked at the linq parking lot."}
{"text":"Called Margaritaville, I assumed they would have endless different kinds of Margaritas. Food is way over prized and the margaritas are around $8-$10 for a 12 oz. They don't have an actual \"fish bowl\". The rooftops is gorgeous with the view. Very clean and nice staff. Just wish their prices were better."}
{"text":"Shout out to Mississippi Marci!  Best service we had in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to grab margaritas! They have a large variety of drinks that are decently priced for the location. We also got nachos and those portion sizes were enormous! Our waitress was super nice, and the interior decor was great. They had a lot of pirate decor on the walls and a huge screen playing 80s music videos."}
{"text":"Margaritaville is a MUST every Vegas trip. Because the volcano nachos keep us coming back. Although they discontinued Buffalo wings and my boyfriend wasn't happy we were lucky to have a really accommodating waitress Tammy. We will be back again"}
{"text":"This was one of the venues where we had my friend's bachelorette party.  We started off the afternoon here and it was pretty fun.  We ordered her a 100 liter margarita and whoooo boy it was pretty big.  It was pretty much a tower of margarita.  Between the 15 of us girls, we finished it all.  
This place is pretty fun and I've stopped by and gotten their strawberry margarita before.  
It's a fun atmosphere and they were nice enough to clear out a few tables for us.  It's a huge venue and they serve food too (huge portions) but I haven't ordered any food there.  
They also have a dunk tank and someone falls into it every so often.  It's kind of fun to watch I guess. 
Overall, this place is pretty cool is conveniently located in the center of the strip, and has pretty good margaritas, true to its name."}
{"text":"One word, OVERATED!  Food was just ok, nothing special.  Atmosphere was over the top and trying too hard."}
{"text":"Well, id like to review it as restaurant, but the SMELL WAS SO AWFUL in there... We walked in and walked out. It smelled like the place had spilled alcohol everywhere, bad sewage, SOMETHING. It was disgusting. Ever been to a real beach side bar?- that sweet, sticky, dirty drain smell coming from under the bar?? Yeah, it smelled like that."}
{"text":"Do not go here. Pretty pricey for the disgusting food. We got nachos and a veggie and chicken sandwich. I took one bite of my veggie burger and could not even stand to take another. The fries and margaritas were good. Our server never asked how everything was and our food was sent back barely touched. The atmosphere is a bit rowdy. There are people walking around on stilts and making balloon hats. They have a \"show\" that they put on which is essentially just them clapping and moving side to side. 

If you're dying to go here, get nachos and drinks and no entrees. Trust me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service, however, the food left a ton to be desired. Please do not serve fish tacos with previously frozen tilapia...you may claim it is fresh, but farm raised fish seldom comes fresh and the texture showed it! Most people in Vegas are typically from somewhere in California and know what a true fish taco should be. For $16, you really ought to to put something better on the menu. If I need a spot to get a drink, this is it. If I need a spot for dinner, I am definitely going somewhere else...UPDATE - I am actually going to amend my review to a higher star due to the fact that the owner reached out to me as a result of my review and displayed a true concern over the experience. I will definitely try them again. The biggest reason? They clearly care about the level of their food and quality of the experience."}
{"text":"A whole lot ofnothing for vegetarians except a mediocre salad but the Margaritas were great."}
{"text":"we go here everytime we're in vegas... Hubby and I are not the club going type but we enjoy a good meal.. I'm not a Jimmy Buffet fan but the place is chill. This time around had quesadillas for appetizer (delish) and tilapia burger... very good.. My fave: pomegranate margarita... yummy.. dislike: overpriced for ok food."}
{"text":"Food was great but way too expensive. $47 for 2 burger platters with 1 coke and beer. The waitress didn't refill my coke but We liked their ambience."}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere and great nachos! Had the margarita flight and it was a fun twist!"}
{"text":"What is this, a joke? NFC championship game and there's one half broken tv at the bar.  Meanwhile the bigger tvs around the restaurant NO ONE is watching has some luau videos going.  Service and food not bad"}
{"text":"Excellent! Great food. Nice associates! Keep up the great work and products!  Fun atmosphere! Good music.Items styles, trendy, price decent. $$ spendy side for  burgers."}
{"text":"This place is wild!!!  I always get drinks and bought some of their souvenir containers which are totally worth it.  The refills are cheaper if you already bring in your own container.  Food is good and they give you LARGE portions, especially the nachos.  They even have a nice convenience shop where you can purchase your Margaritaville souvenirs and the employees are very helpful.  This place is a must visit whenever it's summer because you can cool down with some great margaritas!  Thanks Margaritaville!!!"}
{"text":"They food was awesome and our server was fun and friendly! The atmosphere was fun and loud! We had the Nachos and Margaritas! The nachos were great and tasted super fresh. The Margaritas were cold and just the right to the taste! We go here everytime we come to Vegas and we enjoy ourselves... Thank you guys! See you soon..."}
{"text":"If I could give 4 stars for atmosphere and 3 stars for food I would.

With all the hype of getting a Margaritaville I guess was expecting a little more in the way of Margaritas and cheeseburgers. But I was underwhelmed with both. You can get a much better burger next door at Yardhouse and a much better selection of Margaritas from Salty Senorita. With that aside this place is quite the spectacle. It has 2 stories, a stage, fishing boat booths, and every other piece of decor that a Parrothead could love. TV's broadcast Jimmy himself rocking out and some odd montages of Parrothead outings. Live music is offered here several nights of the week and they offer 2-3 bar areas. If defiantly won't become part of the regular rotation but from time to time we might wonder in looking for our lost shaker of salt."}
{"text":"Great place to relax. Good bar food, folks having a good time. Laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Split a over priced pitcher of margirita and now I have to crawl back to my hotel. THANKYOU MARGIRITAVILLE."}
{"text":"Came in last night with a group of 7, it was late but we were hungry and the margaritas were yummy. Live music was nice and loud. I would say it's a little unorganized but it's Vegas so I get it. I had tenders and fries and split it with a friend. The food was good we ate alll of it. Portions are generous so that's always good. It was my first time and definitely not my last. Gotta love those margaritas"}
{"text":"Nette Lokation. Liegt neben dem Hotel  The Linq. Besteht aus einer Bar und einer Dachterrasse mit Blick auf den Strip und den Ceasars Palace. 

Auf der Dachterrasse gibt es Frühstück und eine reduzierte Karte für Lunch/ Dinner. 

Personal ist sehr nett und wie üblich werden schnell die Vornamen ausgetauscht. 

Wir hatten einen Cheeseburger mit reichlich Pommes. Die Portionen sind wie immer gut bemessen.
Bei den Getränke gab es zum üblichen gratis Wasser das zusätzlich bestellte Getränk als free refill. 
Da diese in Plastikbechern serviert werden, ist es wohl üblich diese dann mitzunehmen, wenn man geht und der Becher noch voll ist. 

Eigentlich ne nette Idee, bei den warmen Temperaturen im Sommer. Man hat also länger was vom Getränk. 
Allerdings die Umwelt leider auch, bei dem Plastikverbrauch."}
{"text":"Seriously i can only summarize this place in one word \"NACHOOOOES\".. order them, i dare you. They are HUGE! 

Super bomb food. Super big drinks. my FAV:)"}
{"text":"I came for the Coconut shirmp... and I was happy with that here, it was cooked perfectly. We came here for apps, and drinks, everything else was just okay. The entertainment needs a bit of a update. And the place itself does too."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and large size portions. I am guessing that every hour they do a mini show with a girl that slides down a volcano. It also have people on stilts that walk around making balloon animals. The only down side I have with this place is the noise level. I think its because its so open and the noise just bounces off the walls. It was hard to have a conversation at our table. It wasn't enough to keep me from coming here again but loud enough to note."}
{"text":"Before coming in to dine here we all read the Yelp reviews which show 2.5 stars over 76 reviews and went in anyway ?@#^&%@$  

They were all correct... Over priced for marginal quality with slow service. We decided to go for the experience and to say we had eaten at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville. 

Maybe the best plan if you wanted to \"experience it\" is to go for drinks and possibly appetizers, listen to some music and then go across the walkway to Yard House to eat.

If you were wasted in Margaritaville the bad food and high prices would not bother you. ... so who knows.. maybe that IS the marketing plan! 

No one was happy with their order, it was slow and not really very appealing.... that being said.. we won't ever be back.  

The music was fun we saw some AZ Cardinals eating there but the food not so much! Won't be back."}
{"text":"So here's the deal... Is the place a \"tourist trap\"? Oh hell yes!!! Does that mean one is unable to have a good time there??? Oh hell no...

The place is huge, can get a bit loud, even a bit \"festive\" at times and the food is just OK. Prices are what one would expect for a Vegas \"tourist trap\" but that's where the ordinary ends, (at least as far as I'm concerned).

We both ordered \"chicken sandwiches with side salads\". Nothing spectacular... But prior, I ordered a 22 oz Landshark draft, (which I have had before), and the wifey ordered a \"Planters Punch\". Not sure if she is no longer the drinker she used to be or if they double dutied that bad boy, but that thing quickly put her happy ass smack dab on  the corner of \"Shitfaced & Happy Go Lucky\". What a buzz it gave her!!! Too frickin' funny.

Naturally, I had to indulge in some Margarita Madness after seeing that shit so I promptly ordered a Margarita Flight. Had never even heard of a \"Margarita Flight\" prior, much less order / drink one!!! Soon, I too took up residence on the \"Twisted Turnpike\". Damn good thing we were walking...

Can't remember the last time I was so freakin' happy to spend $90 on a meal, lol.

A cool place to grab a quick bite, cool refreshing beverage and waste away...

Will definitely try a two-fer flight next time and double my pleasure!!!"}
{"text":"If you're into Jimmy Buffet, I can see how this place would be Mecca. But I'm not. So its not. 

I've only been here like three times and all three times were for lunch. 

When we went they did the whole thing where the hot girl jumps in the margarita tank and the volcano erupts. Its for the tourists and the kids, really. 

Anyways. The food is okay. Its just an over-priced burger joint. I've had a veggie burger. Nothing fancy to it. Same with the coconut shrimp served with orange marmalade, veggies, and mashed potatoes. Its SUPPOSED to be one of their specialties. Big fat MEH. 

The service is always friendly and the bathrooms are clean. But I still kind of feel like the place is trashy. 

The frou-frou margaritas are pretty good. But they better be for $8-10. And since \"margarita\" is in the name of the joint. 

Parking is kinda crappy. The closest parking is in the structure NEXT door to Flamingo's. O'Shea's is in the same building. But every time I've been, you almost have to drive to the roof to get parking. And the lot is damn confusing. Then you have to walk across the alley, passing the big dumpster behind Margaritaville which smells like dying animals. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday. It was a party of 16...originally was told it would be a 2 hour wait but we were seated within 25 minutes. Drinks are amazing. Food needs improvement..oh and service. Can't forget about the waitress we had or lack there of. If you come just go for drinks at the bar. Don't bother eating. Menu needs revamped and prices are a bit high for their food selection."}
{"text":"It's Margaritaville, what more do I need to say?  Good food, great service, love the ceiling and the decorations. I wish it was closer to Tempe and not so far away, we'd go more often. We have lucked out by going at 'off times' where there have not been any events in the arena next door, so we get a seat right away. Went there once during an event and had to wait an hour, and no where to sit at the bar either. Will go again, you should go too."}
{"text":"Though this restaurant has great decor and is very interesting to look at, we felt it was way overpriced for the food that you receive. The club sandwich was dry and the fries were oversalted. At best the food was just okay, but we were disappointed with the prices. For the type of food that is served, it is significantly higher than other restaurants that have similar menus."}
{"text":"When I joined my parents here for food it was nothing to really fawn about but that might be because it was Christmas Eve lunch and just 12 hours earlier I had spent far, far, far too much time inside this same place with my best friend and her sister on the day before Christmas Eve.

The bartenders were great.  Too great.  

I stopped drinking margaritas for a while after that night. Every time I hear that damn Jimmy Buffett song on the radio all I think about are balloon hats, and the rather strong drinks the bartenders made us that night.

It was a lot of fun and the memories (if you can even call them memories) are priceless.  

We got to know some locals and probably the only other Christmas vacationing family in Vegas who were at a margarita themed bar just hours before they celebrated baby Jesus' birth.  It was an instant bond.  

I'd recommend this place in small doses to young people for the drinks but the food isn't anything special and the music will drive you to drink (and I DO love Jimmy!).  For families be warned that a nearly naked mermaid flies down a watered up slide and into a giant green looking margarita glass while swimming and twirling around to Jimmy Buffett classics.  

Oh, Vegas."}
{"text":"I had never been here before but this is where all the older people go.  They have a show with people on stilts and a girl that looks like the Chiquita banana go-go girl.  It was entertaining and there is a clown making balloon hats for people.  The 100 ounce margarita was $75 and it was well worth it.  No need to order dinner since the appetizers are huge.  If you are on a diet or training for a race, don't come here.  Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"My sister-in-law and I ate here for lunch while visiting Las Vegas recently. I enjoyed the experience overall.  We waited about 10 minutes to be seated and the waiter took our orders quickly.  He was friendly and efficient.  My sister enjoyed her margarita and I just had water.  The food all tasted excellent and the boat atmosphere was fun to look at.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Do not be mislead by previous reviews....  This place is a awesome spot to celebrate or go hang out with the family while having fun in a upbeat environment.
We have been there to celebrate birthdays numerous times and also have been there on other occasions \"just because\" and we have been very pleased. 

Of course the Volcano Nachos are a must, but the other appetizers are good too.  Hot wings and the sampler are some other options you won't be disappointed with.  During our last visit, our party of 10 had meals like the BBQ ribs, (so delish!) fried chicken (mmm!) and fajitas. (so yummy!).  All our entrées were great!  Desserts are also mouth watering.  The chocolate hurricane is my fav!! 

The manager there Dan, personally walked over to us to introduce himself and asked us how everything was.  That was very customer service focused in my book!  Our sever Bryan was extremely attentive, friendly, and very quick.  Our drinks were refilled like on auto pilot, we never had to ask for a refill once, Bryan was that freakin' good! 

They have totally cool live entertainment, balloons for kids, a DJ, tv's with classic music videos, a dance floor and very neat Caribbean decor, but best of all it's FREE! 

Overall, Margaritaville and the parrot heads offer a great time!  They have excellent customer service, not to mention the food is very tasty as well!  We will definitely be back here or to the one in Las Vegas! 

If you think it's overpriced, umm this is not a Denny's.  You get whatcha pay for!!   Perhaps try happy hour from 4-7pm and you will still reap the bennies and get the Jimmy Buffet experience on a budget. 

PS:  it's 5 o'clock somewhere! ;)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and to be honest i was not impressed. The prices were so so, on the food and drinks. but there was a 20 minute wait to get inside and once inside so many things were going on it was hard to have one point to have during your meal. servers were nice and i cant say the food was bad, but my drink was a little weak on the liquor and for 11.00 it should be pretty stiff. There is a small show that's nice to watch that happens like every 30 minutes. Don't think i would come back but its a good experience at least once."}
{"text":"In Vegas, I was not really hungry, just wanted to drink...my friend wanted to go here for the chicken wings she was craving....I couldn't wait to try the margaritas...what a disappointment I've had much better. Service was great and I love the bar with the huge margarita tub! I also like how this place is connected to the casino...you can gamble wile waiting for a table"}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Buffett but cant say I love the Margaritaville Cafe.  The food is ok but honestly not worth the price or the stupid long wait.   

Positives:
It serves food.
Fun decorations downstairs and upstairs.
Connects to the store that sells all sorts of Margaritaville stuff.

Negatives:
Stupid crazy lines.
Food is freakin expensive and isnt that good - very dumbed down for the masses.
The margaritas kinda suck - just seem really processed.

Honestly I wouldn't go again but friends always want to give it a try."}
{"text":"One thing I can say about MargaritaVille: their margaritas are not hype. They're worth the money."}
{"text":"Fun. Friendly. Loose. Sure, Jimmy's Margaritaville is a chain, but that doesn't mean it can't be fun! We went up to the deck up stairs and enjoyed the USA-Canada gold medal game with some drinks at the bar! Multiple TVs made it so no matter where you were on the cramped deck, you had a decent view of the action. Our bartender was very friendly (most chains I've been to have not-so-happy people working there) and our time was super enjoyable! Nothing too fancy - just a flat out good time."}
{"text":"Skip...

Got the fish tacos and there were not very good. The fish was rubbery and old. The rice was bland and super salty beans to match. I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"This was dinner out while in Las Vegas. We got here around 4pm. Perfect timing. We were seated quickly. We got the Flat Iron Steak and the Grilled Chicken. We opted for no appetizer and I'm glad because the meal filled us up. The steak was very flavorful and tender. The mango salsa on the chicken was fresh and sweet and the chicken was juicy. We almost left without dessert but decided to have a slice of key lime pie to share. I definitely recommend the pie. While the dinner was very good the pie was amazing. Very citrusy and the side of whipped cream was perfect. All in all this is recommended and we will come back next time we are here. 
Please note...this is a festive atmosphere and there will be chatter and background music. We enjoyed it. 
Randie was a great waitress. Thank you..."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying that I F'ing LOVE Margaritas. So naturally I love coming here every time I'm in Vegas. The Margaritas were delicious and the selection is pretty darn massive. I like to come here and chill out to get away for the shoulder to shoulder crowds and throw down some delicious Tequila. Side Note: While ordering my margarita at the bar some older man pulled out an 8 Ball of Cocaine and proceeded to cut it up on the bar WAHAHAHAHAH F'ing Vegas."}
{"text":"Pro: Great atmosphere, great location on the strip, out of the world nachos, fast service. 

Con: Some so-so dishes, weird hours during the day, \"I want to sit up there!\", slight pricy due to location.

Came here during CES since someone in our group kept mentioning about the legendary nachos and fried calamari. I have to say the nachos lived up the story, but unfortunately the calamari was no longer available. 

Our party ordered burgers, pastas, and salads, but it was the volcano size nachos that really did the trick. 

Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Why do I like this place? Because it just doesn't feel like Las Vegas! 
This place has an amazing vibe to it and the bartenders are really good. There are no slot machines here...just some great food and drink...it allows me to escape from Vegas and it takes me to a tropical place in my mind. 

Dinner is great here...do not pass up the Cheese Burger in Paradise...it is one of the best burgers you will find...plus I highly recommend the Ultimate Margarita. We also sit at the bar and enjoy talking to the bartenders. They are fun bunch up there and make the night enjoyable. 

Recently they added breakfast here and I was able to swing buy and grab a bite before work. I sat at the bar on the second floor and the bartenders that worked up there were fantastic. I had an amazing 3 egg white omelet is so nice not to eat at an all you can eat buffet in Vegas. The cooked to order breakfast was really good. I was amazed to see other people at the bar drinking Margarita's at 9am...I guess that is how you start your day in the desert of sin city...my liver was hurting for them."}
{"text":"I wish I could write a more detailed review for Margaritaville but because of two reasons, I cannot; 1. I visited more than three months ago and the details have begun to escape me and 2. I can't say I was completely sober at the time... it's Vegas! But I can confirm it was a great time!

The interior is awesome, I loved walking through the rocky structure to get to our table. It's a whirlwind of color and sound once you're seated, there's so much going on around you. I couldn't hear a damn thing my friends at the table were saying but whatever. I remember enjoying my drinks and food (what did I order?! darn inebriated memory) and especially the pirate/mermaid act where the mermaid shimmys and slides into the margarita glass.. so fun!

Despite it being crazy busy, our waitress was awesome, too. We'll be back next time we're on the Strip."}
{"text":"Horrible decor. Great bartenders. Not a place I would frequent again I'm sure."}
{"text":"This place was decent, although holy insane crowds, batman! It was a Saturday evening in Vegas, so I expected it to be busy, but wow. When we finally were seated an hour later, we ordered drinks, which were ok. My boyfriend got a bartender's margarita, and ironically, he said it was one of the worst ones he'd ever had. I'm partial to sweet drinks, but even mine was so sweet I had a hard time getting it down. 

Our food was pretty good, and the strange people on stilts (I didn't get it) were nice, albeit a little creepy. I think we both went here to say we'd been, but I doubt we'll go again next time we're in Vegas. If for no other reason, than I don't know if I could listen to that many Jimmy Buffet songs in a row again."}
{"text":"I said I wasn't going to review any place that already had 500+ reviews, but I'm making an exception for, I can't even bring myself to type the name.

Look, I don't like Jimmy Buffet's music.  So when the crowd of foreigners and expats I was with kept wanting to return here I fought it.  I don't like tequila and I don't care about forty year old pirates, or whatever.  But one hot morning (stupid deserts) I was too worn out to resist and I didn't have any better ideas.  Fine, we'll go, sigh, there.

This was the least crappy spot I visited in Vegas.  The service was better than just about anywhere else and the drinks were WORTH the $13+ (plus tax, stupid sales tax) everybody charged for nothing more than a decent Jack & coke.

The \"5 O'Clock Somewhere\" had 151 ladies and gentleman that you can not taste. This should be called The Bad Idea, or Reservations at the Drunk Tank.

I had three.

The three of us moved to a table when we got word others were joining us and it took them a while go get there.  The waiter clearly didn't like us taking up space so when the girls (plus one guy) arrived I ordered some fried cheese curds to just put some money on the tab.  THEY WERE FREAKING AMAZING!  I ate something else, but I was pretty drunk, so I don't remember.  It didn't suck.

So, nope, still can't type the name, if I somehow get dragged back to your awful city, I'll return.  Especially if I can sit in those two spaces where I couldn't hear the music."}
{"text":"Amazing Atmosphere, Beautiful decor, Island music, sure takes you to a happy place.  The food on the other hand needs some work. Portions are small and prices are on the higher side. I was extremely sad to have my Mango Margarita served in a small plastic cup (kind of cheesy if you ask me) but the drink itself was out of this world. Don't stop in hungry because the wait times are longer than normal. I think with a little coaching and training this place will be a great addition to the flats. I'd definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"I like this place. I've got a shirt from here: \"We are the people our parents warned us about.\" In all reality this is a beautiful crowd. A touch on the younger side... I used to come here when I was 21 too and its everything that a freshly minted legal aged young person could ever want. Its a relaxed place... its fun, and there is no pretentiousness. Drinks are mid strip price... not really a place for bargain hunters but it won't matter. If you come here you've got your credit card and are tipsy enough not to worry about whether or not you've got a coupon. Its attached to the Flamingo - a good value slightly upscale hotel that attracts younger people. Trust me... it will be less expensive to spend time having a few here than in the casino with the one armed bandits - give this place a try and buy a shirt from the gift shop so you remember the good times you had here every time you wear the shirt."}
{"text":"it's MARGARITAVILLE! right there the stars are earned. our wait was so ridiculous.. over an hour. we were a group of 8 on a friday night, so i can't complain much. we had the margarita dispenser which is GENIUS!!

imagine a long cylinder filled with cuervo margaritas, with a dispenser on the bottom. it makes a great margarita-bong! we ordered appetizers of nachos (HUGE) and entrees of cheeseburgers (in paradise) and different american-type foods.

fun, entertaining, and a gift shop on the second floor with tons of cute-but-touristy merchandise.

if you're in vegas, which i know you will be!, you have to stop here. try lunch, if possible. the wait won't be so bad."}
{"text":"Food was ok - a banana cocktail really good. However the whole reason we went there today was to celebrate a birthday. My sister recommended Margaritaville as a fun place to do a birthday celebration as it's done well - singing, balloons, hats! Not to mention that we were told that it was, in general, a festive place to eat as an experience- music and interaction among patrons & with staff. But no such thing! It was a boring, ordinary meal at a chain restaurant. 

On the celebration scale, it failed miserably. Even tho our waitress was notified right away, she had to be reminded and then only brought a dish of ice cream with an obligatory birthday wish.  Ughh!! - what a disappointment when you're expecting so much more. Certainly, don't celebrate anything here!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food that is mediocre at best, beers you can buy at the local market & the staff were s...l...o...w!"}
{"text":"Margaritaville was crowded, loud, and SUPER touristy.

Located on the Strip, this is a convenient restaurant to grab lunch at during the day with a group of any size (families welcome), but not a dining destination I would seek out in Vegas.

We sat in the bar and the staff was nice, but not super friendly - happy to serve you their favorite margarita, but not excited to serve you a glass of water with it.  Other than that, no issues with the service.

The drink menu is obviously focused on margs, so don't try to think too much out of the box.  The regular margarita on the rocks was good, so we did have two rounds, but I don't know we would go for another one during lunch (i.e., order your next marg when you are about halfway through the previous one if you are really visiting Margaritaville to live it up).  The flavored margs sounded good - but those who tried them ended up being jealous of everyone drinking \"boring\" margaritas.

The food menu is the same at the bar as in the restaurant, but wait times on food seemed to be a little longer in the dining room than at the bar (pretty common during lunch hours at busy places on the Strip).  Items on the menu were nothing fancy and we generally had no complaints about the quality, but nothing really stood out to us.  Price-wise, this is not a bad option for good food at a not absolutely terrible price (in Vegas terms), and considering its location, it's a prime location for groups staying at different hotels to meet up.

Overall, it's fine.  I like Margaritaville, but it's not my final destination in Vegas.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - you will have fun here. There are all sorts of decorations/props from Jimmy's songs that make a true fan really appreciate the experience. The staff is friendly and fun, and just wants you have a good time.

There are a ton of drink options to fit anyone's desires. The food is just okay but most people would probably expect that. If you're a Parrothead, you gotta go."}
{"text":"And not just because I'm a Parrothead...

The last time I was in Vegas, I was out with a group.  Some had never been to Vegas before and they were losing their minds!  (For example, one guy from Nebraska...  They've got slot machines right in the damn airport!)  This is Vegas.  Come on...  Most of the group was not ready for the price shock, so the first night in town we spent over two hours trying to find the steak and lobster special.  Then after the meal all I heard was \"that wasn't very good at all, and look how much they charged us for the alcohol!!\"

I wanted to get away from all that (it was almost every night).  Don't they learn from the first time?  Apparently not.

Having been to the Margaritaville in Orlando, I knew I would get great food here.  I didn't have to think about it, I just knew it would be.  It was.   I took The Deuce (greatest form of transportation in Vegas ever!) from my hotel to Margaritaville.  I knew there would be a wait, I expected to wait, and I figured I'd look around the shop or musclle up to the bar.  No biggie.

I was pleasantly surprised when the gal taking the stand-by reservation told me that there was a seat available up on the patio on the third floor.  Only a few people were up there because it felt like we were sitting at a bar on Mercury (until the sun went down behind Ceasar's...).  Best decision I ever made!

It wasn't long before the sun dropped below Ceasar's, and the bartender was friendly without trying to push me into anything other than conversation. 

I ordered the jambalaya and it was awesome.  I washed it down with a Landshark on tap, and then the bartender had me try the Lone Palm Ale...  Wow!  And only available at Margaritaville, whereas Landshark is available down the street (still a good beer though).  

After the sun went down, the patio turned lively and everyone up there just hung out.  It was one of those random moments that live in a memory.  Good times."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Monday afternoon 6/16 during the USA soccer game. At the bar in the casino just off the gift shop, not the main restaurant bar.  It was a lot of fun.  Our bar tenders were Billy, Kevin and I believe after Kevin left it was Josh.  Most of our interactions were with Billy.  He was originally from a town that is fairly close to where we live.  Which are both suburbs of Chicago.   It gave us a nice place to start our conversation about favorite foods and things to do.   From there it just went on.  They were a lot of fun.  Had some great bar Flare.  Billy was balancing bottles on the bridge of his nose and serving them, along with bottle flare, noise makers and loud appreciation of nice tips.  We enjoyed ourselves, had too many drinks and watched Team USA win the soccer game.  Great time."}
{"text":"We were in the area for a friend's birthday scavenger hunt and needed a spot to continue the fun. Our friend arranged to get a table for the group and it only took the restaurant a few minutes to put this together.

Our waitress was really great at handling a large group. She was quick to get drink orders started and out to the table. Our food orders didn't take long either. Our waitress was constantly at the table to make sure we had everything we needed. 

I went with a drink called Tranquil Waters and it was a delicious drink. My husband had the Zombie and he really enjoyed his drink as well. I know Margaritaville has a large emphasis on the drinks and I wasn't disappointed with the variety of options or quality of the drinks.

For food that night we had Volcano Nachos and Crispy Coconut Shrimp. The Volcano Nachos were huge. I think four or five of us shared this order and we still didn't finish it. The toppings were loaded on and it was a good bar food dish. The Coconut Shrimp was better than I expected and had a sweet and spicy sauce for dipping. The fries served with it were typical."}
{"text":"Going for a light lunch.  Loved that we got there early and were able to get a seat in the fishing boat.  Just a neat experience and the booth seating is comfy.  I had the refreshing Blueberry pomegranate margarita.  Served tall and on the rocks.  I love the classic margarita served here, but thought I try something new, I was glad I did.  My dad tried the Last mango in Paris and we both agreed it was also worth the try.

I wasn't supper hungry so I had the Corn and crab chowder.  Nice and thick with corn and crab, with a nice heat to it.  Very comforting and filling.  I shared the Asiago crab dip to just have a little something on the side of the chowder and it was a perfect complement. It was also filled with crab and the top had a wonderful crispy crust.

My Dad went the opposite direction and was quite hungry and did the  license to grill.  To which he ate in silence.  He just dug in and enjoyed the combination of sausage, chicken, ribs and something else I'm sure.  He didn't finish it all, but took some home and they made sure he had enough bbq sauce to take home cause that's some of the best part.

We are Parrotheads so we will also stop by, but whether we just drink or eat always depends on the quality of our experience, and each year we have had wonderful service, great food, and great great.  So until next time Fins Up!"}
{"text":"The last couple times I have been here, the food has gone up in price but the service and taste has declined some.  They still have a great cheeseburger and volcano nachos.  The other appetizers we had that we used to like just haven't tasted as good in recent trips.  The quesadillas had a seasoning on top that wasn't very good and the chicken was dry. The boneless chicken bites didn't have much breading.  The atmosphere is still fun, but it's a costly experience."}
{"text":"I was raised a Parrot Head. It would be morally wrong for me to give anything associated with Jimmy Buffet less than 5 stars. My dad would disown me. 

Having said that, this place was sooooo fun! It was super super busy on Friday night and there was a bachelor pre-party in full swing. I also think that every frat boy with-in a 300 mile radius was present. 

My friend and I paid for our first two drinks......then the festivities began!
My poor boyfriend was still hungover and spending time with our hotel toilet, so he was not there to protect me. Whats a girl to do? 

Drink. and drink. and drink some more. and pimp out her single friend.

i have never had so many frozen drinks in my life.

Off To See The Lizard is a midori margarita that made me loud. (the second and third made me popular)

Last Mango in Paris is a mango marg. that seriously does not taste like alcohol at all....i think.....it was my fourth that night...soo....don't trust me.

then i found guava margaritas....I LOVE THEM. by far, the best margarita of my life. I had 3.

keep in mind we were here for hours and we were grazing on Ahi tuna and coconut shrimp. I can't really review them though because I don't remember them. I just saw them on my bill. I didn't even know I ate Ahi tuna.

OH GOD. I had 7 margaritas? guess how I spent my Saturday?"}
{"text":"Found a little 8 person bar kinda overlooking the strip this past August, pretty awesome.  So let's recap;  Decent little casino within a casino, great little gift shop, Landshark on draft, pretty good main bar and food...what's not to love!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in here at about 11 pm/12 am after our drive in from so cal. We wanted some drinks, but we were too tried to go dancing. We were staying at the Flamingo, so Margaritaville sounded like the best plan. Turns out we picked right! Well, minus the loud and not very good cover band - equipped with people dancing awkwardly. Because we came in so late, we didn't have the experience of the long lines and just sat ourselves down immediately. 

Our server ran over and explained the kitchen was closing soon and let us throw in an order of volcano nachos quickly. The two lightweights of the group opted for frozen margaritas, the other two of us who can handle our liquor went for margaritas on the rocks. They were a little pricey at $8, but nothing outrageous (especially for a big-time tourist spot like this place). The volcano nachos are enormous and delicious. Good place to knock back a drink and eating some seriously huge and greasy bar food. I like this place and would go back next time I'm in Sin City."}
{"text":"The service was horrendous. We waited for 10 min to get seated when there was no wait. Then we waited almost 30 min just to get water...as we sit here now we are still waiting on food. I suppose if you want to go to a place where you could knit a knit a whole sweater while you wait you should come here. Sounds like they took the laid back jimmy buffet a little too seriously."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd see a tourist trap in Cleveland. To start, it took forever to get in (4 hours + to be exact) and it was over priced and tacky.  Luckily The East Bank of The Flats has other places to go.  

The  $13 Cheeseburger in Paradise was equivalent to the quarter pounder from McDonald's and the calamari was chewy like a plate of fried rubber o-rings.

I was expecting some cool, laid back place from a Jimmy Buffet song but instead I found a Caribbean decorated version of Applebees."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a place ZERO.
You know, I probably deserved to pay the ridiculous price of 36 dollars per huge margarita for not being so patient while walking down the strip.
I did not have food here, just a drink. 
I ordered the blender-sized 35 oz margarita which was then filled with a few of the slurpee-like liquids of peach, mango, and lime. 

The drink was SO sweet, I could barely drink the thing.
I could not taste any alcohol, just sugar.
I started actually getting heart burn about half way through.

As my fiance put it: \"I was hung over, before I was even buzzed\".

72 dollars later for 2 drinks that were painful to drink, I realize the 13 dollar bong-looking beverages that you can get refilled nearly anywhere on the strip are much better and generally have more liquor and taste nicer on the tongue too.

Less financial heartburn, I might add.
Stay away from this bar/walk in place unless you're looking to carry a giant mug that says \"Schmuck\"."}
{"text":"on the strip=packed w/45 min wait. awesome decor-feels like you are @ beach resort. lots of jimmy buffett music, 3 stories-2 outside decks. lots of bars conveniently located & entertainment
so very cool. everyone was in costume and playing their roles. service was great-they did apologize for having to re-do our wings because of an accident in the kitchen. the put on a show to remember. a pretty long wait for everything though
awesome!! best steak!! cheeseburger was great down to the last bite. wings were great-spicy & meaty. soups were great-lots of flavor & meat(crab & chicken). veggies were crisp & fresh, everything was perfect. very limited menu though-no 1000 island dressing
terrific atmosphere-a partying good time-great eats-everyone in the place looked happy leaving. need some more on the menu though"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to eat in Vegas. The nachos are the best thing probably on earth. My boyfriend and I shared a ginormous strawberry margarita that was about $35 and worth every shiny penny. We also shared a nacho and he got some shrimp. Any time I go to Vegas I come to this place and it never disappoints! Price is high but the food and margaritas is amazing!"}
{"text":"Jared our server was friendly and knowledgeable but the food here was bland as hell. I've been to Margaritaville before and the food was much better in other cities. This food had no taste. I think the cooks need to reevaluate there seasoning level. Other wise service was good"}
{"text":"Margaritaville seemed like the perfect choice after listening to country music for 3 hours while beginning Vegas with your partner in crime from Tennessee. I love my country music, but Margaritaville is a bit outdated. Decor didn't seem all that realistic, and the Volcano wasn't very impressive. 

Food-wise, nothing stood out. Burgers, quesadillas, and the famous mountainous nachos. The nachos are definitely hefty, I'll give you that, but then again you might not want to remember after downing pepto bismol. They have a wide range of margarita flavors, and you can even get the huge souvenir glass, which will only gather dust sitting on that already cluttered shelf at home, for around $35! Yes, it comes with the alcohol, but that just sounds insane to me. Maybe I was still warming up to Vegas prices, but I prefer getting my margaritas from Fat Tuesday, where you can get 48oz of an Everlear concoction for a fraction of that price. More bang for your buck for sure. 

I can only stand so much of watching Jimmy Buffet in concert at the beach, so unfortunately this was a no-go for me. In their defense, I hear it's a lot more lively at night, and there are performers at the restaurant. Otherwise, please skip! There are way too many better restaurants at Vegas! Unless of course you are one of those half naked people at the Jimmy Buffet concert and want to relive those days."}
{"text":"This place has taken a nose dive in the past year. I'm not sure what changed. I've heard the staff, the menu, the ownership, etc. Who really knows. 

At any rate, we had a lack lustre experience here last night. The host and hostesses all seemed apathetic. Same with our waiter.

The food was a shell of its former self. The portions have gotten much smaller. 

We got the club, a burger, taco salad, and fried chicken salad. The burgers and sandwiches used to come with heaping piles of fries. We ALWAYS had to leave with to-go boxes. Last night we finished everything, and we weren't even that hungry. The food was just sad looking. The burger and fries were cold.

My order got messed up. No big deal. It happens. But when they brought me the incorrect order, I reiterated the rest of my order, and the server got shirty and short and simply said \"That was already correct.\" However, they did bring out the correct order very quickly, which I was very appreciative for. 

The atmosphere in here just wasn't great. It used to be fun. Great music, lights, fun and friendly staff, great food including some of the best burgers on the strip. I hope they are able to get this train back on the tracks."}
{"text":"I can't knock it for anything.  My fish tacos where awesome and the décor is cool and nautical.  Our waitress Tabitha was attentive, on point, and friendly.  The music was great and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I highly recommend eating here or just having a drink to soak in the atmosphere.  Soooo COOL!"}
{"text":"Sunday before 5:00 pm and the excuse why they can't seat is is because they don't have servers. They recommend we seat ourselves in the bar and all the tables have \"reserve signs\"
What horrible service!  This is Vegas right?"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas, I suggest coming to this location and they have not disappointed me yet! Each time I go I try something different, and who ever I am with I try their food too. The customer service is always outstanding, food is always flavorful and their drinks are tasty! I've had their pasta, fried fish tacos, jambalaya, Asiago crab & crab artichoke dip and more. EVERY single last one of the dishes were amazing. Even the location is great and they have a bar that allows you to people watch and feel a breeze as half of it is almost outside, while the other is inside. Only thing I would change is adding more stalls to the bathroom (because 4 stalls is NOT enough).

Oh and be prepared to wait for food! If you can just sit at the bar do so, the bartenders are pretty fun too."}
{"text":"We were asked by the hostess where we would lIke to sIt!!! Kolleen our server was exceptional. She was on time and made excellent recomedations. Vicki stopped by several times to chat and make sure our afternoon was exactly perfect. My mom's words were \"excellent and amazIng\" describing her experience here today! We sat just Inside with a fountain view. It was an amazing girls afternoon out! Mahalo JB, Vicki, Kolleen and the rest of the staff!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows the name and this place is kind of cool with an hourly slide down the mountain into a margarita pitcher. The food comes in huge portions so don;t order too much or you will be taking some home. The drinks are very good but a little overpriced. The strip now has all kinds of places offering yards of mixed drinks at a good price, why pay the same price for only a cup here. It is worth the novelty once but I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"After a long day at the pool with many drinks , husband and I wanted to just share a meal before we go back out and partake in more shenanigans. We split the BBQ burger and were in and out in like 30 mins. No hassle or upselling. Prompt service and tasty food that filled us both! We even got water cups to go which in Vegas you know you need ;) thank you Ryan!"}
{"text":"The wife and I accidently walked into this casino from the Flamingo and it isn't very big but the one thing that I did notice was the cocktail service was very efficient.  Though the drinks themselves were extremely weak.  And for That Margaritaville I give you three stars!"}
{"text":"Fun environment!! Great music and Margaritas!! Great service and nice people!!  Food was amazing too! We had a buffet and the filet was the bomb !"}
{"text":"Although the margaritas are overprices and mediocre tasting, Margaritaville is for sure a Las Vegas Strip staple and will make walking much more fun."}
{"text":"Supposed open seating- Nope- here's server Melody \"holding\" a table for people.  Not in restaurant business, but guessing J. Buffet doesn't have her on payroll to \"hold\" open seating at the bar"}
{"text":"Although it's considered a Tourist Trap, it's not too expensive.  Most of the food was around $15 bucks, so for a theme spot it's not bad.  We shared the French Dip and the Volcano Nachos and both were good. The Margaritas were also nice and strong."}
{"text":"We called weeks ahead to make dinner reservations here for a friends bachelorette party. When we arrived to the restaurant we were told they don't accept reservations and we would have to wait.... even though we had made reservations?? They said the wait would be 45 minutes but it was actually 2.5 hours. To top it off the hostesses were rude. 

Their rooftop bar was \"closed for construction\" which makes no sense because they just opened??  Why are they already needing to close part of the restaurant down. 

The drinks were weak and expensive as hell, which I expected and unfortunately I was right. The food was horrible. I left with a bad stomachache. The quality of food from your local TGIF is gourmet compared to this. 

The only reason I'm not 1 starring this place is cause the vibes are cool and there was a fun band playing when we were there."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner. Wait time was less than 20 minutes. Cocktails were good and the atmosphere was very inviting. Great entertainment from the staff to fit anyone's occasion for being there. Food was very appealing and drinks were great."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here this weekend. After waiting for about 15 minutes we got a table. The restaurant will give you a buzzer to hold onto and it will light up once you get a table.

Food: Ample, AMPLE portions. In fact, I struggled to eat most of it and had about 1/3 of my chicken meat left and another 1/3 of my rice left. I couldn't finish my plate because it was so huge. I ordered the chicken fajitas and it came with 4 wraps, rice, guacamole, sour cream, veggies, lettuce, and cheese. I also had the crab and mushroom dip with bread. It was very good. The bread was a bit buttery, but you can't really expect otherwise.

Service: The waitress was pretty good. She came by a few times to make sure we had water and our needs were met. Another girl with Hawaiian gear and accessories came by to ask if we wanted to donate money for breast cancer awareness \"tata\" organization. The Hawaiian necklaces were cute and you get it by donating $15+ to the organization.

Music: There is music along with imagery on repeat mode within the television screens in the restaurant. There's also live music and some performances (e.g. dancing) on the mini stage at the end of the restaurant. There is music playing in the bar section of the place even though I didn't sit there.

Seating: I wanted to comment about this because they couldn't accommodate us to sit at a regular table. As a result, my friend and I sat next to each other in a \"bar\" style table even though we wanted to sit in a regular booth/table. Minus 1 star for that.

Pricing: Prices are reasonable and the portions are ample. I think the food they serve at this restaurant is similar to some of the other \"chains\" in Las Vegas such as Hard Rock or Rainforest Cafe. It's still very good food and you can be assured that there's a certain level of quality to it.

Location: Near Harrah's and OShea's (on same side of the street). Convenient location across from Ceasar Palace - center strip. 

Parking: There is parking available next door in the Flamingo Hilton/O Shea's casino parking lot (free of charge). Make sure you take note on where you parked as it can be a bit confusing if you don't remember.

I need to go back to try their margarita and probably should've ordered once since it's \"Margaritaville\" after all. Also, I loved the \"Hawaiian/hang loose\" atmosphere at this place."}
{"text":"During my last vacation in Vegas, Margaritaville was the first stop during our first night out.  We wanted our first night to be more relaxing, so we decided to get some drinks and walk around the strip.  While we were at Margaritaville, we sat in the outdoor bar at the top.  I'm not sure if we would have had as much fun if we were in the main area of the restaurant, since it's pretty loud and full of people.  However, the outdoor bar was really chill with a full bar and bunch of tables. 

And just as Benjamin Y. mentioned, the tables are first come first serve. We finally figured that out after a waitress told us to sit anyhwere we wanted.  We were able to get a table at the edge of the bar area , with a great view of Caesar's palace and got to watch the packed outdoor patio of Pure Nightclub.

The great thing about this place is that it's on the strip, but it's not super fancy, so the prices are good. The drinks that I had while we were here were very good, and ranged around $7 for shots, and $8-$10 for cocktails... Definitely a lot better than other places on the strip or in the casinos.

If you're having a casual night out, I would suggest Margaritaville as one of your stops... Save some money and sit around and listen to r&b/hip hop, and of course the live singing... you can laugh at the people who suck at singing... (no offense to those who have sang live there.. but it's entertaining)"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour a few months ago.  My first time at Westgate.  Must visit again soon.  Very crowded.  I really liked the yacht table-tops.  Reminds me of a great seafood place in CT that had a real yacht floating on water inside the restaurant where a couple could actually dine in private!  I DID NOT like the clown on stilts wandering all over the place... very strange and so out of place (unless there's a Buffet song that mentions stilted clowns, then I suppose it would make more sense!).  Maybe it's just me... I DON'T LIKE  clowns- just like Carrie opined in Sex and the City, clowns give me the creeps!

However, what do not give me the creeps are the $1 mini-cheeseburgers in paradise (sliders) and the wings!  The sliders were even charred, just like in Buffet's song.  Haha.  Still pretty tasty.  And I loved the margarita made with blue curacao... But maybe any drink would taste great to me if I hadn't had any in months??  Come to think of it, anything you like but haven't had in a long time would look/smell/sound/taste/feel great... \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\" they say.  

If it weren't for the clowns on stilts, I'd have gone back a second time."}
{"text":"Nachos are huge and delicious but wish they had during game specials.  Also the tv's fur watching a game are crap. You're at Westgate they should have better Moore impressive tv's to watch football. I'd recommend other sports places over here."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to eat here just for the ambiance and the drinks, and walking by this weekend while in Vegas we decided to check it out. There wasn't a wait which was perfect and we were seated right away. The service was awesome. Drinks were STRONGGGG....holy crap were they strong. So many combinations it was hard to choose! I ended up ordering the Buffalo Chicken Bites to eat and they honestly weren't great. However, my other girlfriends ordered the Seafood Mac & Cheese and it was TO DIE for. I think I ate like, half of theirs. The portions are HUGE too, we saw someone order the nachos and I couldn't believe my eyes haha. It was a good time! I'll be back for sure, maybe at night next time."}
{"text":"LOVE Jimmy Buffet but not this joint!

Service was slow, waiter seemed to be on his game but just understaffed. 

It was just a regular Saturday evening - no Sports at the neighboring arenas. 

Food was OK, definitely overpriced for what  you get. Onion rings were soggy. Had 2 Marguerite's in the smallest glass ever with tons of ice. Taste was OK but at $10 each for the limited amount of SIPS you get?

Buy his records, dance to his music, but unless you are willing to pay for little else than atmosphere you might want to try another one of the Westgate restaurants!"}
{"text":"The rooptop bar was pretty cool, but for a place called Margaritaville the Margarita's were disgusting, nothing but sour mix."}
{"text":"The food is inexpensive, awesome ambiance, the margaritas are great!!. Thank you Jimmy Buffet for creating Margaritaville!!"}
{"text":"Some friends invited me and the hubs to Margaritaville on our first night on his most recent trip to Vegas. I'd never been, so I thought we would check it out since it is a Vegas institution.

What a rip off! We ordered one of those really huge margarita pitchers for everyone in our group to drink. I had about 4 or 5 glasses from it and instead of being drunk or even just BUZZED, all I had was a sore throat from the sweet and sour mix. 

I will say the volcano nachos were good, I shared with a friend of mine. My husband ordered the Buffalo wings but wasn't impressed. I was pretty disappointed that a place known for their margaritas served such bad ones, however. My husband and I  headed straight to Fat Tuesday to rectify the drink situation and were pretty happy after that.

Probably won't be back if I can help it!"}
{"text":"Just what you think it'd be: your typical corny, chain restaurant. The only thing good about this place is the liquor and people watching. I got their chicken sandwich with a gluten-free bun and side salad. It's like a step above a TGIF's, basically. Nothing worth writing about. It was a stop for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Usually when I have friends in town who want to walk the Strip I recommend this place. Yes it's a chain, yes it's super corny and yes the prices are expensive, but it's the Strip and everything is going to be overpriced and corny. 

This most recent time I came I had the Taco Salad without the ground beef to make it vegetarian friendly. It was a pretty basic salad, but overall still tasty and a large portion. I always recommend people to get the volcano nachos. They're super good & more than enough for 3-4 people to share. The rest of the food I was say is hit or miss, definitely not anything over extravagant, but it is a chain restaurant after all. 

If you're touristing around and want a nice bite to eat along with a mermaid show, check this place out. You can also get a margarita tower too... what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas right?"}
{"text":"Ok place I guess. We just ordered margaritas, not food, and both margaritas came made differently than ordered, but it was still a good drink. 

Ok, butttttt you're called margaritaville.... I'd think the ONE thing you wouldn't screw up would be the damn margarita??"}
{"text":"Nice place for my 1st time. I loved the battered chicken tenders and margaritas for the happy hour"}
{"text":"A good experience.  Excellent service.  Food was good, especially the seafood.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Loved it! Ordered my virgin daiquiri in a mini-blender (I'm pregnant) and was a happy girl! Bartender was very friendly and made sure that no one took my seat since I was pregnant and couldn't stand long. Will definitley go back!"}
{"text":"it's been about two weeks since I went to this place and now I can do my review.  

I think when it comes to celebrity type food joints that people are so excited that it's a famous persons restaurant that inside they are hoping so bad for the food to be good.  

I know I've done this when going to Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood. Both places are cool to look at and walk around in, but their food flat out sucks and is not a big deal.

Well I wouldn't say that completely about JBMs.  First off, visually this place is pretty incredible.  Ive walked by the location in Vegas a dozen times and have always wanted to go in, but never did.  Finally after seeing a movie we decided to eat here.  The feel of this place definitely puts you in a resort on the Bahamas.  We sat in a boat that was converted to a dining area (at least it seemed that way) and I don't remember the waiters name, but he was straight from Jersey or NY.  Very cool guy and answered anything and everything for us in regards of what to order.  Some how he talked us into ordering Sea Snails..  Those were some tasty snails!

We all ordered different things and me being a simple person occasionally, I got a mushroom burger.  Even though ive always been disappointed in mushroom burgers, I guess I hoped this would be the one time it blew me away.  It wasn't.  it was just a mushroom burger.  Don't get me wrong, I dont hate them, they just dont wow me over like a good bacon cheese burger can do sometimes.

Loved their iced tea and we even got chips & salsa to tide us over til the food came in.

Very cool place and I would definitely go back again and try something else.  Service was rockin and it's definitely a place to bring the kids and family."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this restaurant but it really disappointed us. We were staying in The Flamingo so it seemed like an easy breakfast choice. We waited for about 15 mins, that was ok pretty standard in Vegas to wait.

We sat at our table for probably 10 mins before our server came over to even get us started with drinks. When he did come over we were ready to order, we ordered drinks and our breakfast my husband had the chicken and waffles and I had the key west omelette.

The coffee came pretty quick so did the food, however the omelette was awful it was cold and the shrimp was rubber, it had a really rich cheese in the middle that was not even throughout the omelette. The chicken and waffles were not much better the outside of the chicken was really greasy but the chicken was dry on the inside. The fruit that came with it was not fresh. 

Don't waste your money on this one. Vegas is full of great restaurants, this isn't one. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I can never say no to margaritas.

First night we went here just to see what kind of music would be playing since last time my friends went they were playing reggae. This time, it was country music but that apparently did not stop us from dancing. 

Soon after that, Margaritaville became a regular stop for us during the rest of our stay here.

I got the raspberry and mango margaritas, frozen, on separate occasions. 

How they make their flavored margaritas is that they just poor syrup into the cup and then top it off with their house margaritas. I mean, it gets the job done, but depending on who makes your drink it may not be completely mixed together all the way. But, the house margarita itself is really good so it's not too bad. I liked the raspberry one better than the mango.

Would return once I'm no longer margarita'd out."}
{"text":"Always a good time at The 5 O'Clock Somewhere Bar. Coconut Shrimp at the restaurant is great. Customer service is always the best."}
{"text":"This is always our first stop in Vegas. Great drinks, the upstairs bar is perfect no matter the time of day.  I suggest the nachos."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fun and energetic.  The waitress and staff made the overall experience enjoyable, however the food and mixed drinks were underwhelming.  I had the Crispy Coconut Shrimp which was not very good - -  the coconut shrimp out of a box from Costco is 5x better.  My colleagues commented their dishes were just average at best.  With all the other dining opportunities in Las Vegas, I don't plan to return here.  I was looking forward to the experience at Margaritaville, but left somewhat disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here one night with my hubby. We drank margaritas. The night started out with people singing karaoke, but once people stopped going up the karaoke host rocked it. It was a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Can't even go to a restaurant in Vegas without getting hit up to spend money on something in a sneaky way!  After walking the strip and being practically assaulted by overly eager men trying to give me \"free samples\" and selling questionable beauty products, we made our way to Margaritaville in the Margaritaville casino. I really needed a break from the high-pressure salespeople everywhere. 

Let me say that if I could give this place a 3 1/2, I would. I am torn between a 3 and a 4. 

It was dead in there at lunchtime on a weekday so we got a table right away. A while later, a friendly lady comes around asking if we want our picture taken for \"free\". I know better--we do a lot of traveling, and usually when they are eager to take your picture it's not because they are trying to decorate their walls or because you just look so great that day! She sure seemed eager, taking shots of all of us, then just my husband and me, then the kids. Of course, a few minutes later she was back with our tiny free postcard picture, and the other three she took were for sale for $10 each. The pictures were actually really cute. My husband was on his 2nd or 3rd \"perfect margarita\". So of course he bought them! They were cute pictures but my opinion? How very tacky!  We're in Vegas and we didn't win. We're spending enough on your food and drinks and you come around with talk of free pictures. It was really unnecessary. I can see it at a place like Graceland or Disney, something like that. But not at a restaurant in Vegas.

As for the atmosphere, I love all the Margaritavilles I've been to. This one is no exception. If you like Jimmy Buffett, palm trees, and all things tropical, you'll enjoy it.

Let's move on to the important part: the drinks. My husband loves those perfect margaritas! My personal favorite is the Bama Breeze. So yummy! It's kind of like an alcoholic creamsicle. How can you go wrong with THAT? (FYI \"Bama\" is short for Alabama, where Jimmy B. came from--I learned that in Orlando once after mispronouncing it!).

I had a burger and it was tasty. I believe it was called the \"cheeseburger in paradise\". I can't remember what hubby and the kids got, but they all seemed happy. The food in general is good at Margaritaville, all the locations I've been to. 

So I would recommend this place. But get ready to \"say cheese\"! And remember: nothing is free in life or in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love the place! This restaurant has cool interior decoration of a huge plane, a boat, fishing rods and nets. Staff attending to us is very friendly, joke with us and make us feel at home. We ordered IPA and cocktail recommended by the staff and it is really good. Good recommendation! Food is really good too."}
{"text":"AWFUL Service. Didn't get water or napkins..had to go to the bar myself and get drinks. I wouldn't come back here if they paid me to."}
{"text":"We came here because it was close to our hotel and one of the few non-fast food places on the strip with meals in the $15-$20 range.   Our friends nabbed a table on the 3rd floor patio which was absolutely lovely - outside so we were able to enjoy the breeze, but shaded and with water and AC vents to keep us cool.  Service was nice and friendly, and our waitress did a great job keeping tabs on our group of 11 and managed to get all our orders right.   Food was good but not great - my turkey burger with mushrooms and cheese was solid but nothing to write home about.   Portions were pretty good-sized though, and I didn't finish my food.   Bottom line: Really fun atmosphere, friendly service and edible but not amazing food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner and drinks at Margaritaville during our trip to Vegas on 8/15/15. I ordered the fish tacos which were pretty good didn't really care for the tasteless rice or tortilla but the fish and beans were really good. for my drink i ordered the Blueberry Pomegranate Margarita blended with salt on the rim, it was really good I even go a light buzz which is a plus since the drinks were expensive. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Went there for a early dinner with the family before our flight. I cant tell you how close in seconds I was to paying for the ice tea my husband ordered and just leaving. Yikes! the prices were out of this world! $14 for a burger and fries, seriously?! I decided to give the benefit of the doubt and order anyways, dumb choice. The food is just mediocre and the prices on the high side for sure. 
I ordered a chicken burger with onion rings. You get 4 onion rings exactly because they are large ones. And my chicken tasted like it had been taken out of the freezer, boiled and slapped on a bun. So not impressed, and not enough food on the plate for the price. 
My husband had a mushroom burger ($14) with fries. Cold fries and a very slim portion, come on people thats the cheapest part of the meal! Burger was very average. 
Decor is kind of intersting and was seated quickly. Also the drinks are just as over priced as the food. You are clearly paying for the brand name of this establishment when you pay your check. There are other and better values in Vegas. I will not be eating there again next time Im in town."}
{"text":"Yummy nachos!!!!! i ordered the volcano nachos and when it came out all i could say was wow they were huge. My boyfriend and i couldn't even eat half of it, and we love to eat. We ended up taking the rest home and i couldn't even close the box it was so full. My boyfriend ordered the mushroom burger (we didn't know the nachos would be so big) it was pretty average burger. 
The service was great. If you don't like to be bother while you eat i don't recommend this place. There's loud music, guys and girls on stilts walking around making balloon animals, women in bikinis walking around trying to get you to donate to Save The Tatas, and a girl sliding down into a big margarita. Overall i had fun food was alright at best but the nachos are amazing. Of course they had really good margaritas..."}
{"text":"I have never seen so many empty cups, cans, and bottles in my life. The lack of bussing happening on the roof top bar drives me to drink....maybe that's the goal? Cool that CLE has another rooftop spot, not so cool that this place is totally filthy. Don't even bother with the bathroom. Hoping these are growing pains for this newly opened spot but I expected better management."}
{"text":"I've been in a couple of times now, my mom is a HUGE Jimmy Buffett fan so she enjoys the environment.  We all agree the food is a bit over priced but if you're a fan of him you know most of his stuff is.  You're with out a doubt paying for that name and atmosphere.

The best bet for us and I think price wise is enjoy the app menu, there is some great stuff on that menu and you can try different things.  We LOVE the nachos and there is plenty to share!  Drinks are light on the booze heavy on the price but that's pretty normal for Westgate I find."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, decent blended drinks....

and the margaritas we came for were SUPER watered down.

These boys bought us a big ol' tall dispenser thingy full and we couldn't finish it. But one of the dudes were so nice and gave it to the senior citizens sitting right next to us... and they lit up with joy. So cute. Military dudes are so courteous.

Across from Ceasar's palace... and next to O'Sheas where this cool Midget stands to reel in a crowd with his deeeeep barry white voice."}
{"text":"Awesome staff. Our server, Nicole, was such a dear. Despite her being so busy, she would always drop by our table every now and then to ask us how we were, occasionally staying to chit-chat for a bit. 

My family was seated at a comfy booth overlooking the stage. This was at about 9:30pm. The lights were dimmed and when we noticed that the spotlight was aimed at the stage, we knew there was going to be a live band and couldn't contain ourselves. Before delving into the restaurant's ambiance, I'm pretty sure my parents would agree with me that the food was pretty savory - although nothing out of the ordinary to be honest. We had a triple decker sandwich that came with fries, crab and corn chowder as well as buffalo wings. Except for the soup, definitely try out the other 2 orders. 

Music started at 10pm sharp and went on for an hour. I was very impressed with the band's line-up and still couldn't quite get over the fact that they sang one of the hardest and my most favourite songs - More than a feeling by Boston. Sure, it was pretty loud but what would you expect at a Vegas restaurant? We didn't really get a chance to talk while the band played which helped us channel our focus solely on the food. I guess that's a good thing. Overall, I would recommend people to try out the place. Just take note of this; if you like a more mellow ambiance, try getting to the restaurant earlier in the day."}
{"text":"I came here on a work trip to Vegas with a couple co-workers and had their version of a Cadillac (blended) margarita. It was AMAZING and  I will definitely be back!! Definitely pricey though at $12 but that's to be expected..."}
{"text":"I give three stars because of he live band, the food is nothing to brag about.  We should have left when they told us the menu was limited by 1030 but of course they waited until after they seated us.  I had a rancho burger and fries, the fries were not hot and the burger wasn't good.  My husband had hot wings .  My sister had the lava lava shrimp that was probably the best thing but I've had them before and they weren't good in my opinion. Come to find out we told our waitress Maria that we wanted 3 different checks and she put it all on one check but split it up.  2 of us paid cash and 1 a credit card she charged all to card and took the cash where they do that at!!??!  Don't know if Maria thought we were tourist but she was dead wrong.  Be careful!!!"}
{"text":"The tuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude. The hostesses had attitude, the server had attitude and the bartender had major attitude. The drinks and the atmosphere were great but the employees were terrible."}
{"text":"You must go to Kevin haha he's a funny guy and great bartender. He def made my night lol thanks Kevin"}
{"text":"Gotta love margaritaville! When every other restaurant was packed and had an hour wait we found this margaritaville and was seated right away. Food was good as always- fish tacos , but the Drinks have too much sugary pre mix added to them. For what it is we were hungry and this was a better option then a fast food to go place. It is entertaining with ladies and men on stilts but they looked like they need more staff."}
{"text":"This is an okay place to get a burger and a margarita.  They're strong (both the burger and the margarita) but if you've been working a tradeshow and want to quickly get inebriated - come to margaritaville, have 2 perfect 'ritas, and all will be well in the world."}
{"text":"Tucked inside the Flamingo on the street side, the first thing you notice is the pumped in smell of suntan oil and beach. It's actually refreshing and nice, not cheesy and disgusting. So here's the deal here...Nothing too different about the casino part, typical. Slots everywhere. A different vibe, though. If you happen to be in a Hawaiian shirt, you'll probably be mistaken as an employee. We ended up here 3 nights in a row because of the 5 cent beer from 5-6pm. Yes...You read that right...5 cents! A great place to start the night if you are going to be getting your drink on anyway. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Margaritaville is mostly just a touristy bar on the strip serving touristy food; nothing to write home about, but location-wise, it's fantastic.  If people watching is your thing, downstairs bar near the strip entrance is fantastic.  If strip views, head up to the third floor outdoor bar.  Only giving it three stars because of this; it's a try hard two star establishment if it were anywhere but across the street from Caesars.

My recommendation, if you're in a small party, is visit the back bar.  It is way back there and you'll feel like you're in a cave, but the bartenders there are much nicer than the ones up front, and they make better drinks.

Some tips: the BOGO coupons for margs that you get from Flamingo are for their house marg which tastes like lime Gatorade.  Alcohol-wise, and taste-wise, you're better off just buying their \"Perfect Margarita\" even if it does cost double; one of those tastes ten times better and has more alcohol than two regular house margs anyway.

Next, if you get a $5 off $25 retail Margaritaville coupon from Flamingo, there is a very important word in that, and that's the word \"retail\".  It means that if you purchase $25 of tourist junk in their store, you get $5 off, but it is not usable for restaurant bills regardless of them sharing the same name and a restaurant being a retail establishment just like any other business selling goods or services to a consumer.

If group dining is your thing, you'll probably be disappointed there too.  They have an excellent event space on the second floor overlooking the strip, but the catering at private events are a limited menu and insane prices above and beyond their retail prices; oops I just called the food/beverage retail, which they're not in the mind of Margaritaville.  In any case, you'll pay a big premium to hold an event there, so if you're considering Margaritaville for a wedding rehearsal dinner or reception, for example, there are far more cost effective options up and down the strip."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Friend had the el diablo burger which was pretty good. Everything else was very average-tasting Mexican/American food, though the portions were sufficiently large and filling. Do NOT get the fish and chips, might be the worst fish and chips I've ever had. It looks and tastes more like a giant chicken nugget.

On the plus side, there are people walking around with stilts which are very entertaining. Also, once in a while this girl dressed up as a mermaid dances in a volcano and does a sort of pole dance in a giant blender. So +.5 stars for entertainment, though I would still round down to 2."}
{"text":"My hungover friends were craving nachos of all things, so we decided to walk on over to Margaritaville. I always pass by it, but never went inside or notice how big the restaurant is. I can definitely see this place as being fun but touristy. Kinda like a Rainforest Cafe but less emphasis on animals and more on the tequila and Jimmy Buffett.

We came at 3pm on a Saturday. The hostess said it'll be a 25-30 minute wait, but it ended up being close to 45 minutes. There were a lot of tables open, but they were probably just understaffed. 

Food was meh. We got the Volcano Nachos, which they weren't kidding when they named it \"volcano\". It was a gigantic pile of chips, but I feel like there weren't enough toppings. Only one small dollop of guac and another small dollop of sour cream. Not enough melted cheese either. 

We also got the crab dip. The cheese in this was too overpowering, so I couldn't taste crab at all. I did like the crostinis though.

Sadly, none of my friends were down to split a margarita with me, so I'll probably stop by in the future for one. Seems like they have a pretty good variety. Our waitress was nice and constantly refilled our waters since we all looked like we were dying."}
{"text":"For my friends birthday, we all met at Margaritaville on a Sunday afternoon around 4pm. Fortunately, her parents got there much earlier to put our name in for a table - and were told it would be a 4.5 hr wait. Yikes! Who would actually wait that long?  I'm pretty sure they were just trying to get you not to stay there. Fortunately it wasn't actually that long, but a couple of hours - and we were seated.  

From there, the experience was extra blah. It took forever to get our drinks, I eventually just started to order another drink as soon as I got one so I didn't have to wait 20 minutes. Does it really take that long to take a cap off of a beer?

It took about an hour for us to get our food - which really looked and felt more like \"fast food\". Super overpriced for what you get, and really nothing to write home about with so many amazing options close by.

If anything, just come to Margaritaville to enjoy the tropical feel, relaxed atmosphere and half indoor/half outdoor bar for drinks."}
{"text":"Went there twice.  First time solo.  Sat at the bar, friendly bartenders, good margaritas, food decent and delivered quick.  

Second time with family.  Sat at a table.  Extremely poor service.  Inattentive and \"dont give a sh*t \" attitude.  Food took forever and was cold upon arrival.  Waitress shrugged her shoulders and took off.  We left.  No tip, not going back.  Vegas is hurting for business...you can do much better at a place that would appreciate your business.

Appears from other reviews that the wait staff is a big problem.....maybe Jimmy doesn't pay well."}
{"text":"Well I've been Margaritaville's all over the country. This is probably the worst.   Waited over 20 minutes to get in and then find it's practically empty. Asked for a table on the patio and was denied saying they didn't have servers.  This is Las Vegas my goodness!  Food is overpriced considering the quality being mediocre at best!  Worst experience in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday right after the grand opening and had no wait at around 5:30 pm. Three of us ordered drinks and we all enjoyed what we got, even though it took quite a while to get them. Of the four of us at our table, two of us ordered the chicken caesar salad (which I had previously eaten at other Margaritaville locations and loved), one got the fish tacos, and the last a cheddar BBQ burger. When our food finally arrived about an hour later, we received side caesar salads instead of the entrees we ordered. We were told the kitchen made a mistake and that what we actually ordered would be right out, but it ended up taking about 30 extra minutes (way after the other two at our table finished eating). The chicken caesar salad I received was nothing like what I remembered and a huge disappointment. Definitely not worth the $15 it cost. They ended up charging us slightly less, but still way more than what the salad was worth. My other friends said that the fish tacos were good, but the rice and beans were dry and tasteless, and that the burger was average at best. Overall, while the restaurant itself was nice, service was lacking and the food was overpriced and not very impressive. I will not be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville came to Cleveland and  it was anything but satisfactory. We asked for an outside table - only to be seated inside. Ordered 2 drinks - only for them to bring out one, when they brought out the Mango margarita - it tasted mostly of syrup. The chicken quesadilla was brought out without chicken in it. The waitress only refilled 1 out of the 4 empty waters. The bathroom floor was completely soaked, and the restaurant was freezing. The Blueberry Pomegranate margarita was an excellent choice of drink, and the general atmosphere of the building did make you feel like you were on vacation. Overall Margaritaville Cleveland did not serve Jimmy Buffett much justice."}
{"text":"Runnnn!  I have nothing positive to say but the inside looks very nice, the service was bad, the food was terrible, I wouldn't recommend it...We waited a hour and our food came out cold, how can you mess up nachos (shrugs shoulder)! It happened, oh the drinks were okay but it took 30 minutes to receive those as well. You better off at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Good food and great experience ! Kinda expected more out of the drink. Had a strawberry margarita .. Maybe just an off day but that's okay. I'll still be back. !"}
{"text":"I went here on Friday, St Patricks's day for lunch, the place was very busy but I only had about a fifteen minute wait,  I was alone and the hostess sat me at a table overlooking the goings on at the strip.

 I always order the Perfect margarita and it didn't disappoint. I wanted to get the Volcano Nachos but its too much food for just myself so I went with the Cheeseburger in Paradise.
 It was very good and the fries were cooked just right, not soggy and white like most places. The waitress brought me a side of ranch and the service was excellent.

I really love this place and I got to hear two of my favorite songs: Margaritaville and Volcano!"}
{"text":"I went the other night with my family and a friend from out of town. Before we ordered we told the waitress we needed 3 checks. When it was time to pay she came with one check with our orders separated. The total was 108, so my brother in law paid with credit and the two of us paid in cash. My husband and I total was 34 and change, my friend was 28 and change and my sis was 48 and change. We didn't really pay too much attention we were tired and wanted to go home. Her service wasnt that great and the food wasn't either. My sis called me today and told me she charged the whole 108 to my bro in laws card, so she basically pocketed our cash as a tip. She probably thought we were tourists and I wouldn't be surprised if she does it all the time. So be weary when you go out to eat on the strip and you get separate checks!!"}
{"text":"We ordered drinks and appetizers. The drinks were good but the food was cold. We chad a nice view of the naked men outside"}
{"text":"Wish I could give a review on the food and/or establishment but, unfortunately, we left before we ordered anything. After standing, for a few minutes, by a sign that said \"please wait for host to be seated\" we were barked at from about 15 feet away by a waitress/hostess?? Who immediately made us feel stupid for standing by said sign and pointed to a bunch of hightop tables and said that you just seat yourself. So at this point she walked us to a high top table that was literally feet from both the bathrooms and the kitchen. We are from out of town and we're looking for the \"Margaritaville\" experience which this was not matching. So we asked if we could be moved to a table in the, at most, half filled dining area. With a somewhat disgruntled look on her face the hostess pointed us back to the direction where we were initially waiting and said to go see the host and they would seat us. So after wandering around and finally seeing the host signs and arrows intermingled with the rest of the restaurant decor we found our way to the host which immediately got on her intercom and started asking, I believe, the same lady(?) that we just left, what hightops she had available. At this point I interjected and explained that we wanted to sit in the dining area at a table and not in the seat yourself bar area. I'll admit, at this point, we were fairly frustrated and it continued as 3+ people sat 5 feet away talking to each other confused like this was an unattainable request. So after a minute of this ANOTHER lady guided us towards a booth to which when I approached and saw that the table was permanently attached to the ground there was no way I was going to fit as I am 6'4\" tall and over 300 pounds. So as I expressed this they immediately went back to the intercom communication as my wife and I stood they're embarrassed while other patrons looked at us and the spectacle that was taking place. It was at this point where we politely told them never mind we weren't going to stay for dinner. It was unfortunate. We have eaten at other Margaritaville locations such as CityWalk location at Universal in Orlando and loved the food and the gigantic nachos and the Caribbean style music and atmosphere. Definitely did not have the same experience at this Las Vegas location in the flamingo casino. Needless to say we will not be going back. Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"It's really disappointing that our experience here was subpar at best yet once again. 

If you see my previous review, I'm a huge Parrothead and make it a point to visit Margaritaville quite frequently and have been to most of them several times. This has nothing to do with knocking the brand. This has to do with the terrible service at the bar at this restaurant. 

I won't name drop but there's no other way to say it...the lady bartender (forgive me if there's more than one) at the bar where the giant blender is flat out rude. That or she was having two bad days in a row. We went in this last week and as we sat down, and it wasn't busy, she walked up and basically stared at us like we could read minds. I sort of looked back like \"did we miss something\" and she eventually rudely asked if we wanted food and/or drinks. I got a Landshark and the wife got a Cabernet. We eventually ordered volcano nachos and I made it very clear I have a guacamole allergy and she asked if I wanted them on the side and I said \"no, I'm very allergic\". Long story short they came out with guacamole all over them. Had to reorder. We were disappointed and left for the 5 o'clock Somewhere Bar, which is amazing and had the friendliest bartenders. The way the brand should be represented. 

Went back Thursday for drinks and there she was again. Maybe she was upset we tipped her 15% only because the service sucked and the order was wrong but she again didn't greet us. It's obvious she's not a fan of her job displayed by the lack of customer service. 

We stopped in Friday for a quick lunch before heading out. We sat down at the bar because we were told by the gift shop it was open. But, she was cleaning still and told us only the bottom bar was open. We left and came back around 1145. We again ordered the Volcano Nachos and as we watched everyone around us get food that sat 30 mins after we did the bartender came by and apologized. Long story short it was 40 minutes before they brought them out. And the cheese was like cold and hard and the chicken was terrible. Obviously they sat for a better part of the hour it took to get them. We didn't complain and still paid. 

Sad to say we probably won't be back to this Margaritaville.  Margaritaville is a state of mind where people pay a high price for a moment of escapism and fun and they lack all the above at this one. It's reminiscent of how the Glendale location was before it shut down. I really hope they get it together here because if this is your first exposure to the realm of the Margaritaville empire you will be sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed visiting while in Vegas. For lunch I ordered a burger, hubby ordered chicken tenders. It's amazing how you can account the cost for a pre-made frozen hamburger patty that cost 15.00. Not cooked all the way thru, asked for may, mustard  and no garnish. Had to wait over 8 min for the waitress to come. Ack to the table after the food was served and by the time I received the mayo and mustard was well over 11 min in total.  By that time my burger was cool/warm and the frys were not even warm when originally delivered. Hubbies chicken strips were crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside..so not done on the inside. Ordered iced tea which had hearty amount of ice but when the second glass came no ice. So very disappointed cause we have always had good service at this restaurant"}
{"text":"Enjoyed some massive $55 margaritas with a tap on the bottom.  It took 6 of us about 30 minutes to drink the damn thing!  I guess we were at the restaurant bar, not to be confused with the 5O'clock Somewhere Bar about 25 yards south on the strip and closer to the actual casino.  Nice balcony overlooking the strip.  Try the Bahama Mama and you'll find yourself wondering why you can't see straight after about two."}
{"text":"This place rocks. It's a tons better than the Margaritavilles in Chicago and Nashville, It is comparable to the one I've been to at Niagara Falls in Canada though. 

This place is huge, it has a Casino [of course] and a cute little bar off to the side on the sidewalks side for the passerby's on the strip to stop in and have a drink. They offer these amazing blends called \"Booze in a Blender\" all of them are sooooo good AND they get the job done without you even knowing! :] 

The food is the same as all the others so I deducted a star for the lack of  a \"WoW\" moment but otherwise the staff is really friendly and courteous. The atmosphere is great as well, and although Vegas is surrounded by a dessert the shipwrecked theme somehow fits a lot better in here. 

What you should definitely try to do though is go upstairs! You see a big chunk of the strip as you sip on your beverage of choice, so beautiful!!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast.  While the service was very slow (food coming out) our waitress Sabrina was very nice and helpful.  My Husband loved his Extra cheesy omelet.  Bacon was crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a Jimmy Buffett fan so I was predisposed to like this place. I had the Cheeseburger in Paradise, husband had the Jambalaya, we both thought the food was good. And, as far as prices, compared to the other restaurants on the strip this was on par or better than other places we ate at. Loved the atmosphere. The waitress (I wish I could remember her name) was terrific. I felt comfortable having my 8 year old daughter there--and she was happy to get a balloon animal. She asked me how to get one and I said, \"sit here and look like you want a balloon animal.\" And, that worked. Bahama Mama was awesome. Although I was looking for a Hurricane on the menu. I wish there was a Margaritaville closer to us in MI. Maybe I'll add visiting all of them to my bucket list."}
{"text":"Being that it was six of us, we have mixed reviews about this place. The drinks were just ok.  Quesadillas were ok, the scampi pasta had mediocre flavor,  the nachos were huge but lacked in flavor.  HOWEVER, the shrimp and grits got rave reviews! Not much menu variety other than sandwiches, pasta and overpriced basic dishes! It took FOREVER for our food to come and one of the orders was wrong. They did comp the incorrect order which was nice! Overall...no need to stop... unless you are craving shrimp and grits!"}
{"text":"Super fun! I had such a blast here after the Britney Spears show. I ate the best hamburger with sweet potato fries.  Huge portions. Great drinks. Great live band. Everyone was awesome."}
{"text":"Went today at 6 and asked the bartender if there were any happy hour specials.

He said no and then turned around and walked away!! What the heck, man. We were still trying to order. Idk if William was having a bad day or what, but he was a terrible server. There were 3 of us in the group and after each order, he'd walk away! We had to flag him down three separate times!

Find a new job, buddy. Bartending ain't your gig.

Drink was fine, but wouldn't recommend the place based on my experience.

Management may want to have a chat with William..."}
{"text":"A good place to go if you aren't really into clubs/don't want to wait in a line/don't want to pay admission. They have a live band playing there that plays a good variety of music that appeals to everyone.

Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste. After two I felt disgusting. Their volcano nachos are ridiculously huge but good to share with a huge group. 

I considered this place my \"back up plan\" I wouldn't plan to go here first but if all my other plans fell awry I would be happy here."}
{"text":"If your expecting to have one of those experiences of feeling like your in a tropical resort or off the beaten path, forget it. This was my first experience of eating at one of Jimmy's restaurants. I won't be back. I found this to be one of those places that you can say \"I've been there.\" 
I knew from other people's experiences that these restaurants are mediocore at best. Plus, everyone of these restaurants I have been by in my travels, they are never full. In fact, the gift shops usually have more people in them then the restaurant.
Anyway, I met a friend at this one (a long drive to get there from the East valley) to discuss some business. 
The food: I ordered a Cuban sandwich. I love these, so I figured, how can you screw one of these up? Well, it wasn't hard. I've lived in Florida, so I know what a Cuban sandwich should be like. First off, you only get half a sandwich. The bread was kind of hard and chewy (Could barely cut it with a knife), only a very small (and I mean very small) portion of pork on it (shredded), and some ham that I think came from a grocery store pre packaged. Not even deli cut ham. I only received one pickle on my sandwich. The fries were starting to get cold by the time my meal made it to the table. The iced tea was good. I do think that for the price, it could have been better. They should fix the meat and add some black beans and rice as a second side dish.
Service was pretty good since there were not a lot of people to be served.
I do like the gift shop, but those prices are crazy high on tee shirts, etc...I won't be back. Jimmy is truly in it for the money. Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Margaritaville has amazing, and decently priced food for the strip. They can handle a lot of patrons. Also check out the bar, 5 O'clock Somewhere. The have 5 cent beers from 5-6pm."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas, I gotta hit up Margaritaville!!  

The decor is kinda all over the place.  Surfboards on the walls, Tiki hut bar, and waiters dressed as pirates on stilts making balloon hats?  Hahaha, wtf.  I got a heart hat and my friend got one with a turtle, kinda.  

The margaritas are good--I go for the mango margarita, simple but it was made perfectly (when I had it).  Nachos are of course the big hit with its portion.  Oh, and you know when you're in Vegas when there's a woman in a bikini who dances around the restaurant, climbs up the roof of the tiki hut bar, and slides down into a big ass margarita blender while doing a water show!  Haha, very entertaining!"}
{"text":"I had supper tonight at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.  It seemed like a fun place ... and it was.

There is music constantly going along with videos.

I had a Landshark Lager.

There are three pirates on stilts who go around making balloon animals, hats, etc.  Every hour at the top of the hour, they play Buffett's Volcano and Margaritaville and the stilted pirates gather.  Then a girl climbs a ladder above the bar and goes into a volcano and comes out in a bikini.  She comes down a slide and lands in some water and does some Cirque du Soleil moves.  Then she dances for a bit.

I ordered Buttermilk Fried Chicken, minus the green beans (so they gave me extra mashed potatoes, though I didn't eat them all).  Real chicken rather than processed ... yay!  Though it was good, I found it all a bit too salty.

Maria was my server and she took good care of me.

There was a band coming on about 11 but I was too tired to hang around for them. 

There is a gift shop and casino right next door."}
{"text":"This had to be my favorite place to stop and get a drink on the strip. They have a front patio and a cute, beachy, bar right inside - which is where we sat!

Billy, our bartender, was freaking amazing. The tricks this guy could do....had my speechless. My ADD kicked in hard because I could not keep my eyes off of him! lol he sure as heck made the drink worth paying for bc he made them strong and delicious. 

Honestly, it's mostly always the service that makes me excited to give a place 5 stars. Thanks Billy, you made that happen!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed. Corporate ambience. Very generic. Overpriced menu. The server got my order wrong and then argue with me about it. Jimmy, you should have gone with your first thought and not sold corporate."}
{"text":"I've been to the location in Florida multiple times and loved their food. I was however a little disappointed by this location. The food was good but the service sucked. My bf and I waited for a good 10-15 min. before a waiter came by to take our drink orders after we were seated. Our drinks remained empty for a while before they were refilled too. When we were done eating it took a long time for the waiter to walk by to see that we were done. The music was good but really loud, we had to almost yell to hear each other. 

If you're looking for decent food but willing to hang out for a while this place would be ok but if you're looking to go in, eat, and go on with exploring Vegas I would recommend somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's the day after the marathon and we're walking up the strip looking for a place to grab lunch and we suddenly spot parrots and from somewhere in the vicinity \"Margaritaville\" starts playing, we look up and we're at Margaritaville.  I guess it's a sign.

A photo with the parrot costs $20.  Forget that.  How much are those Hawaiian shirts in the retail store?  $50?!  Ok, let's just get lunch.  How much will that cost us?  

This is a pretty groovy and laid back place.  It's tropical island decor and there's a plane hanging from the ceiling.  We sat on a high table and checked out the map for Florida and watched the local crowd.  It was pretty packed for lunch.  We eyeballed the nachos as they passed us by but they were a bit too much for us so we got the fish burger and fish tacos.  I'm telling you; this fish thing is going strong.  All the way to Vegas.

I started off with their tortilla soup.  It was heavily spiced and there was a strong onion flavor that didn't agree with me.  I took a few bits and basically just couldn't stomach anymore.  The fish tacos were ok.  I didn't really care for the cilantro sour cream sauce and it was generous doused with it throughout my tacos.  Service was fast and friendly and we enjoyed the ambiance."}
{"text":"Coming to Margaritaville, at least for me, has been similar to doing heroin.  

I came here for the first time years ago and thought it was the best thing ever. Yummy sour apple margaritas in a yard-long cup that had a neck strap.  I think it's worth noting that I was pretty WASTED on my first trip.

Every subsequent trip has been spent \"Chasing the Dragon.\"  I just can't get that same feeling anymore.

Super loud and crowded to the point that I can't have a conversation with my own table. Lame music & \"entertainment\"

Service leaves much to be desired...I think everyone appears to be drinking on the job.

Won't be back if I can help it."}
{"text":"Love this place! I used to go so many times! The food and service here is very good! Their drinks are good too, obviously. When I went there, I had a very tasty salad. The dressing was made by the head chef. Some oil from the salad stained my blouse, but I didn't care. The nachos were piled high and couldn't taste any better. I love picking from the middle where the chis a re somewhat soggy from the cheese. There were many people in my group, and we didn't finish the nachos! I've also had the tortilla soup which tasted good too.

After some good eats, my friends and I hit the dance floor. There is a live band that plays, then after a certain time they play music ranging from oldies to whatever is current. Our waitress had everything in order and we were seated and served very fast. If you're visiting Las Vegas, this is a nice place to visit. It's in a nice location on the strip, so there is no traveling out of the way."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while, but this is the spot that my friends and I usually come when we don't want to deal with clubs/lines/guestlists/crap. I've never eaten the food here, but we come here when we want to make SURE everyone has a great time.

Great frozen drinks and great dance music, surprisingly enough! It's a fun atmosphere, there is never a wait to get in and we can always find a table. Most of the time I'm there, they have live bands..... I've seen people of all ages having a great time here so whether you're a college kid, way beyond a college kid, or just like to cougar hunt, you'll fit in here. It's never disappointed me!"}
{"text":"Good margarita but I don't know if I would pay for drinks if I can get them for free wen I gamble"}
{"text":"Food is good. Atmosphere is good. Service is poor. It could be the location, but the wait time is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The drinks are priced a tad high ($11 for a margarita that comes in a cheap clear plastic cup).  The food is not spectacular nor does it suck.  

BUT the patio is awesome for drunk people watching or challenging your friends to \"who can get more people to ______.\"  This past weekend was the battle of the sexes on high fiving.  Oddly some of the older gals were more riled up than the younger ones but it probably has to do with the footwear.  Isotoners apparently kick ass more than 4\" stillettos.  Drinking is a marathon, not a sprint...c'mon ladies!"}
{"text":"Really loved the tropical fruit frozen margarita but the best part of this place was the great attitude of the bartenders. They were super friendly and constantly did balancing and juggling acts to prepare your drink."}
{"text":"Never in a million year would I have imagined I'd ever dine here!  Every time I passed by, there were tons of drunk and loud people standing around with big huge tall glasses of alcoholic drinks.  (Sorry, I don't drink so I have no idea what they are, most likely Margaritas'.)  On top of that, I HATE places with loud music!  They do a little show where a girl slides into a BIG margarita glass pool.  They also have several guys on stilts walking around and making balloon 'art'.  (Quite entertaining for kids actually.)  Seriously, this is not my kind of restaurant!  

When I got the $25 coupon in the mailer, I was going to just throw it away.  But then I thought, well, maybe, why not?  At worst, I just don't eat the food, right?  I am such a sucker for free food!   

We ordered the Coconut Shrimps and BBQ Babyback Ribs.  Wow, to my surprise, they were EXCELLENT!  Big plump crunchy shrimps with sweet/spicy sauce.  The mash potatoe was really really good and the  vegetables were not bad, either.  I can't stand soggy vegetables and these were fine.  

The Babyback Ribs were sooo tender they fell off the bones as you bite into them!.  You can choose one of the three BBQ sauce (South Pacific, Cilantro Pesto, or Guava BBQ).  I can't remember which one I had.  I just remember it was good!!!  

The price may seem a little high, but portion is BIG!  With the $25 coupon and the rest on the Players card points, free food never tasted so good!  

We had been back again since our first time and it was still good (and still free)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere here but would be better if they ever open the rooftop on the strip, was always fun during happy hour up there but hasn't been open the last couple of times we were there - please open the upstairs bar !!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been very eager to try Margaritaville for quite some time, so we figured her birthday would give us the perfect opportunity on 6-14-14. The experience was very disappointing and I will never return.

My wife and I arrived with our small party around 10:30 and the door staff was very friendly. We sat down at a table and waited ten minutes for a server that never came. I went to the bar area to try figure out how to get drinks ordered and the gentleman at the bar insisted that I ordered for my entire party at the bar. After talking to him for a minute  or so he told me that he would personally be down there in just a minute. After waiting five minutes he came down and took down our drink order. This was the last time anyone paid our table any attention. 

We figured we would give the bar a chance for out next drink order. I ordered a simple beer which was fine, my wife was in the mood for a shot that involved Tequila so we tried to order a mixed shot that was listed on the menu. Of course the bar was out of ingredients needed to make that shot, so the bartender ended up making a tequila shot with an orange mix. The bartenders attitude while doing so was clear that he was not happy in doing so. I brought the shot to my wife and after one sip i could just see the look of disgust on her face. I brought the shot back to the bartender and asked if we could we just have a margarita instead because it was clear that she was not going to drink the shot. Once again, the bartender had an attitude the whole way through which is what finalized my opinion of this establishment. 


Before we went to another establishment we went outside to have a cigarette. When we went outside there was one other gentlemen besides us and a security guard. After 3/4 of our cigarettes the security guard informed us that we had to smoke in a specific area of the patio. This would have been nice to know before we started. 

The staff here is unfriendly and disengaged with what is going on around them. It is obvious that customer service is a priority here.  

I will never return to Margaritaville and I will make sure to tell others about my experience."}
{"text":"Yea this place is kinda a tourist trap. So here's this huge two/three floor restaurant/bar that people can come and hang out with parrotheads and drink cheap tequila margaritas. Yes they carry the brand of their very own Margaritaville tequila. Good marketing concept. But tequila drinkers know that tequila should not be infused with sweet artificial flavors of coconuts, lime, oranges, etc....This place invites the smell and sounds of the islands. Ok the ghetto part. Where the stale beer lingers and the smell of sweat and suntan lotion lingers. 
As far as the food is concerned ok you gotta think typical bar/restaurant tropical cliche....
Uhm who has crab cakes? Ohhhh how original. \"Yea the crabcakes are soooo goooood\" bleh bleh
Wings - got wings? Ohhh yea wow..wings.....
What about coconut shrimp...? 
OH YEA THE COCONUT SHRIMP! Wow Fantastic...yea......
Well I had apps and they really weren't bad....because they were like costco brand. Maybe I'm just not impressed anymore and I need something more original? Maybe it's just overpriced and I'm bitter because the tequila is not that high quality and I need something with uhmph!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get the night started out right with some good 'ol company...

The drinks were reasonably priced and the vibe was really upbeat.  The crowd is mixed with people of different ages from tourist to locals. Not exactly a place I would hang out at for the rest of the night, but it looks like a great place to grab lunch with friends or co-workers."}
{"text":"Cool interior and friendly stuff. Me and my friend had a good time there. Margarita was ok."}
{"text":"This review is focused on the breakfast served by the restaurant located on the Flamingo property. Breakfast is served upstairs on a balcony. Seating is limited (perhaps 10 four tops?). The atmosphere is boardwalk casual. The servers are also very casual in their approach, but are decent. 

The menu is a bit limited, but our food was served hot and tasted great. The portions were good but not overly large. Prices are very reasonable. Especially given the limited choices for breakfast on The Strip, I would recommend you try this restaurant.

Bring a light jacket on other than on the warmest of mornings."}
{"text":"This is going to be short. If you walk in to a bar and the first thing they do is frisk you...turn around and walk right back out because you're in the wrong bar. We also walked by later to see three policemen outside. That is all."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for dinner for convenience, as we were staying at the Flamingo. Reliable menu, nothing too fancy or expensive, entrees average $25. I had the sangria,  very good helped me relax after a long day of traveling. We had nachos and beers. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and watched Danilo Oribe give a nice bottle juggle show! I don't know what the art of his act is called but it was super cool! 

He was twirling bottles, tossing and catching them, and not spilling anything

He was also a really nice guy"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the atmosphere at Margaritaville! The giant margarita blender was amazing, and the night I went with a few friends they had a really good live band playing awesome dance music. There was a shortage of tables and seats, but it didn't stop the fun!

Honestly I didn't have any food or drinks there. It was more of just a walk through and hang out for a little bit, although I really wanted a drink. Walking by the tables the food looked and smelled delicious though! And the little ring game looked like a lot of fun too!"}
{"text":"Yesterday 8/11/17. What started out ok w a 25min wait for a 2/3 full restaurant, wasn't a big deal. Server was great(5star for her), I wish I remembered her name. Review is food only related. 

My son, almost adult, ordered their new \"chicken fajitas\". $19.00 4 tortillas and enough Poultry for a couple fast food tacos and enough veg for a couple. Portions like you would get at a kids meal at fast food place. That wasn't really the issue because all know vegas in general is a complete rip off cost rape wise and tourist won't bitch because they think the hot sewer vents down the strip remind them of Disneyland. Sorry, back on point. Only thing he ate yesterday were the fajitas at the restaurant because of being on road all day. As he was eating them , flavor was fine, yet he kept asking is it normal for this type of chicken to have odd hard pieces in it? Filling napkins w who knows what when boneless chicken breasts shouldn't have bones etc. (wasn't crispy at all) onion, peppers and sauces were all cooked soft of course and flour soft tortillas, couldn't tell what it was. Tired not wanting confrontation we went on our way. Fast forward a couple hours after dinner to this morning extreme stomach pain, antacids aren't helping, fizzy water , coke for nausea, nada. So now we are stuck in our room until we must leave for check out. No use of the $40 extra \"resort fees\" that popped up a few days ears ago. (Might save us from more food borne issues in LV except the waste of $$ room rates etc for inflated weekends). Something is up. We both have iron stomachs and never happens. We know where Buffet goes when the volcano blows, but when your stomach....."}
{"text":"Provided you're at least a casual Jimmy Buffett fan, this restaurant is fun. One of the cheaper meals out I had on the strip. The food was quite good, and the service was more than adequate. The atmosphere is clearly what makes or breaks this restaurant for most people.

The giant volcano over the main bar of course pales in comparison to the one in front of the Mirage just down the street, but it's purposefully more kitschy and fun. There's a giant \"Booze in the Blender\" that slowly fills up over an hour and when it does, the \"Volcano blows.\" Most of the floor is decorated to look like you're in open water and several of the tables are decorated like skiffs. We were seated close to the bar on the main 'ship' section of the restaurant. There were several \"Postcards from the Road\" screens showing a combination of Jimmy Buffett videos and other music from his Sirius XM station. I don't follow Buffett personally but have always been a casual fan. His style of music is fitting for the very very casual atmosphere of the restaurant.

Just like most musician-themed bar/restaurants, most of the items on the menu are named after forced puns on Buffett songs. This seems to work a little better with Buffett since he actually already has both his own beer and margarita line and songs about food.

I was tempted to get the \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" but instead went with the \"Volcano Burger.\" It had chili and cheese sauce and avocado and Fritos and jalapenos and it was a little overwhelming. The burger kind of fell apart when I tried to eat it. Nevertheless it was tasty and cooked to my liking. The bun was a little dry but not too bad. We went in the afternoon for lunch and did not have to wait long. The burger may have benefited from having the bun scooped out to leave more room for all of the toppings. On the bright side, I had plenty of chili/meat salad to eat after I was finished with my burger from all the toppings that fell off.

Long story short: Margaritaville is not about the food. It's clearly about spending some time wishing you could ever be as relaxed and carefree as Jimmy Buffett himself. The atmosphere is nice and the food is fine. If you're a Buffett fan you'll have the time of your life, as long as you don't blow out your flip flop."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Jimmy Buffett, so when a few friends suggested we grab some food at Margaritaville, my mouth started to water for a salty rim, full of tequila. However, I was disappointed with this location [I've been to the one in Orlando], for the following reasons.

1. It was packed. Being in the serve industry, I know things get busy and I tend to get annoyed with patrons that bitch and moan about a wait. I wasn't one of those people, but some in my party were. I explained to them the sitch, so they calmed down. After all, we did have a 12 pack to drink, while we waited. 
2. We were seated shorter than our wait time, and brought back towards the bar. It took our server a good 12 minutes to greet us, and by that time we had figured out our orders, as we were just going to split a handful of apps to save a few bucks.
3. The food was meh. I wasn't impressed with the nachos, but did find the wings to be pretty good.
4. Prices were much higher than i've ever seen them...this is vegas of course.

Overall, it wasn't anything special and didn't ooze the typical JB charm. Oh well, we can't win them all."}
{"text":"This is the third Margaritaville we have been to...Key west was def. the best (food-wise), but this location had the best entertainment. The nachos are a must at any location! Pretty cool to grab a bite to eat, enjoy the show, then play a hand or two of Blackjack next door."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast Friday morning at like 8-9am when we first got into town. It was my husband, our friend and myself. We all ordered a Redbull infused mimosa. Tasted weird at first, didn't know a redbull oj mimosa was vodka?(guess I should read the description before I choose drinks) Anyways, it was good but way overpriced. Ordered the Key West omelet. It was delicious. $14.99 crab, shrimp, hollandaise sauce. NOM. Husband ordered the eggs benedict. He always loves it, as long as the hollandaise sauce is right and the eggs aren't overcooked you can't go wrong. Would eat here again :) Forgot that they gave us a 20% off our next visit coupon. Darn."}
{"text":"We are locals and this used to be our favorite restaurant. We had the locals card and would get a discount when we ate at the restaurant. The last time we dined there, I gave my locals card to the waiter when we ordered. At the end of the meal when we got our check I asked for my locals card back. I also noticed we did not receive a discount on the check. The waiter brought the card back CUT UP and told me they no longer accepted it, and that I needed to join the fins up club for special offers through email.  I didn't appreciate that he cut up my card -I would have liked to saved it as a souvenir. I thought that was pretty rude. We haven't gone back And don't plan to."}
{"text":"Steak fajitas and margaritas were solid. Next time we are getting one of those monster orders of nachos!"}
{"text":"I ate at Margaritaville twice while I was recently staying at the Flamingo. The first time I ordered the Peel and Eat chilled Shrimp appetizer, It was wonderful, smothered in Old Bay Seasoning (which im a huge fan of!) with great cocktail sauce. It was enough for one person to have for lunch.  The next day we ended up going back for a drink and I ended up ordering the fish tacos for a late lunch (*now that's not something i normally order when eating out since you never know what your going to get, for the most part im always disapointed!) but it was really really great!! the slaw was just right, making the tacos not too dry and not fall apart wet,  the fish was good, not overly breaded. wonderful flavor.  I only had a bit of the rice as the tacos were a good size and filling.  Only drank beer but maybe next year will get a margarita:)  thought it was all good for the price and will for sure be back next year.  

on a side note, my friends love the nachos and it took 3 of them to eat one order! good bang for your buck if your splitting!  and my other friends had the burger in paradise and they said they were great as well!"}
{"text":"Go for the drinks, go for the atmosphere, maybe even for the music, but skip the food.  The food I ordered smelled like dirty dishes, and the waiter took so long to come back to check on me that it wasn't even worth asking him to bring me something better/that didn't smell like dirty dishes.  THe margaritas were awesome though."}
{"text":"WOOHOO! I love this place! I wish they had a Margaritaville back in LA. I spent 5 days in Vegas and 3 of them consisted eating at Margaritaville. One of the servers who helped my table out didn't even jot down our large order. She remembered everything off the top of her head and brought it out correctly. Impressive! The bartenders also make it an awesome and fun vibe to be around in. 

**TIP FOR MY FELLOW PARTY ANIMALS**

You cannot leave Vegas and call it a good weekend without trying their mouth watering nachos. Even if you can't find someone to share them with, screw it ! Get an order all for yourself. I did so and of course couldn't finish the massive amount but don't let that stop you. ;)"}
{"text":"I never got the whole parrot head thing. You don't need an island to be a hopeless drunk. Nevertheless, assuming you find some solace in a Hemingway like ocean experience, you won't find it at Margaritaville. This place is as plastic as they come. The huckster t-shirt trinket store upon entering screams tourist! It all goes down like the Lusitania from there. Let's start with the beer selection. Oh that's right, there really isn't a selection. You can have boring beers or the equally boring Landshark. My wife and I tried the peel and eat shrimp. How bad could it be? Well it was bad. Over cooked for starters and served with runny no taste cocktail sauce. We headed for the lifeboats on that and avoided the main course. I give this place until the weather turns in November. Then it will be boarded up like a beach house in the keys during hurricane season."}
{"text":"After eating @ the Margaritaville in New Orleans, this one is OK. Interesting decor sitting in the fishing boats unless you have to sit up front instead of on the back. Good photo ops and Cheeseburger in Paradise is good but Fat Burger is better in my humble opinion. 

Tourists love it, locals meh, I've had better."}
{"text":"While in the flats on the 4th we decided to try out the newest place down there and one that has had all kind of hype since it has been made to be multiple things before deciding on Margaritaville. I had seen some pictures online of the inside of the place, with blue led lighting in the ceilings and pontoon boats as some of the booths. When we got there however it was much larger than I expected, which is good since it was super crowded. I wasn't impressed with the fact that there is a gift shop immediately in front of you when you walk in and basically in the middle of the dinning room. I got the feel of an adult Chuck E Cheese, but I'm sure that's somewhat their expectation and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. I have no desire to ever eat there, however we did get some drinks and headed to the roof top bar. There is also an outdoor bar off the front which was nice, but the rooftop had a great view. It was super crowded but that's to be expected, we were lucky enough to get chairs after being there a while. It's a place to check out, and say you've been, not a place I need to return to."}
{"text":"I must say they did a nice job down in the flats, and the atmosphere was amazing and Margaritaville the service was very well unfortunately the food was just okay and very overpriced, my burger had no taste and was dry"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, Great Atmosphere...

Crazy right? A chain like Margaritaville has great food, great service and a great atmosphere? NO really - if you visit this chain restaurant the hospitality won't disappoint.  

It was our first night in Las Vegas, as were walking around and looking for something to eat we came across Margaritaville.. I wanted to try this when we were in Key West but my hubby wouldn't let us... So I won this argument.. 

We came inside, which had a different seating process. (You visit the hostess, who prints out a name and table, take this to the dinning room, where one of the staff members will seat you) Upon being seated we were greeted warmly by our waiter who took our drink orders and appetizer. Shortly after he arrived with our drink orders and promptly took our dinner order. 

Appetizer: Hot Spinach and Artichoke Dip - this was brought out in a piping-hot plate with warm tortilla chips, and topped with some grated Romano and Parmesan cheese. It was quite good, I couldn't complain because we've had some really crappy spinach and artichoke dips. It was quite flavorful and hot. (they got the basics)

Dinner: We had the Mixed Fajitas (Chicken and Steak) - which came out on a sizzling platter topped with vegetables (onions, carrot, etc), a plate of warm tortillas, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on the side. THIS MEAL IS BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO - trust me on that ( we didn't even finish it) The great thing about these Fajitas was that the meat and veggies weren't just thrown on the grill and cooked... They were actually seasoned - not overly seasoned but just right.

The waiter was great - I asked him if he knew any hookah bars in the area and he even went and asked other servers and staff (wrote it down on paper and gave it to us) 

Atmosphere: The the atmosphere was great, its a great fun place to visit - they even had a DJ on the stage playing some great songs (mix of both country, hip-hop, and even pop)."}
{"text":"I decided to give Margartiaville one last try before leaving Vegas, and I must say the service was impeccable.  Although I did receive a response to my initial posting, my second experience was much more memorable. Everyone has a bad day, but customer service should always be put first. 

I still stand by my initial recommendation of the chicken tacos - the meat really was divine even the second time around. Next time, in going to see if they can put it on a salad!"}
{"text":"The waitress was friendly, the decor was FUN and the margaritas were delish.  I got the portabella mushroom sandwich...I think it was 12 dollars or so...I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Reminded us of FL - sweet drinks, buckets of beer and key west feel. I think we went on the second day and you would have never known. The staff was working well together and the food came out tasty and fast. 

I had a southwest chicken salad - super fresh and not overdressed. The kids had chicken tenders and loved them."}
{"text":"I really enjoy stopping here for lunch when in Vegas.  The atmosphere is fun and the food is good. I have had the seafood mac and cheese which is probably the best thing they have! It has son much cheese and flavor and I don't usually even like mac and cheese! The nachos are some of the best nachos you can get anywhere and they are huge! They always have lots of toppings and are perfect. Of course there is a great margarita selection and lots of Jimmy Buffet music playing and a gift shop. This is always a quick lunch stop for us to grab a reasonably priced meal before a long day of shopping!"}
{"text":"A lot going on in this place, if you like action this place is for you. It's like a circus performance in there, literally. Good bar and seating throughout. Don't order the volcano nachos, well below average. The plate lacks substance as I found myself eating mostly chips and cheese. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Went there after they first opened and service was super slow but I figured they needed some time to figure it out. Have been back twice since and tried to eat there both times, but the wait was 2 1/2 hours long, and was not that packed! We stayed and went to the bar in the main diving room near the band. I counted six tables that were dirty and sat there dirty for at least ten mins, along with glasses and plates that sat dirty in the bar area where we could have sat down. I have not experienced anyone being super friendly... the customer service does not match the fun atmosphere, which makes it feel off, as it's a jimmy buffet establishment for crying out loud! I watched a bar tender and a girl yell at each other, and after seeing cold left over food sitting out, I have no desire to eat there either... I will stick to going to coastal taco, beerhead, or collision when I go to the east bank."}
{"text":"Food was great. Perfect margaritas were perfect. A 100% better experience than Margaritavilke Key West!!"}
{"text":"Needed a relaxing dinner so we went to margerittavillle. It was REALLLY good food. Good sandwiches! Sat in bar, not very fast service . The nachos are huge! We also had taco salad which I suggest for smaller group of people who may want nachos."}
{"text":"Great place to visit on the strip, great food and the wait staff was awesome - Shannon was a fantastic waitress."}
{"text":"Skip this establishment while in Vegas.  My husband and I went to this restaurant while we were waiting to check into the Cromwell next door.  Margaritas are super sweet and the service was lousy.  Our food took 40 minutes to arrive to our table and my husband's food was cold.  Ask for a manager and even that took a long time.  Save your money on overpriced food and super sweet drinks."}
{"text":"I came back here again for a frozen margarita (more than once) & was impressed that this time I tasted the tequila in their berry margaritas. The food usually is consistently good from burgers, we ordered just a seared tuna appetizer which I thought was a good Asian fusion with the spices & unique coleslaw to cool down the spiciness.
The times I've gone were around lunch to afternoon times."}
{"text":"If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain ... if you're not into yoga, and you have half a brain ....  DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE

If you are a middle aged individual who wants to hit the dance floor and show off your tired dance moves to Beyonce and Chris Brown on a Saturday night while paying $11.50 for a vodka redbull, then this is the place for you!

I love Jimmy Buffet and I love the Margaritaville in Vegas, but this place somehow derailed miserably."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Vegas!  So much fun!  I am not into clubs, rather just listen to great music and have good food and great laughs!  Last time I was in Vegas I went there 3 out of 4 days I was there.  And the night I saved for my special birthday dinner at an upscale restaurant I ended up getting food poisoning from bad scallops, so after I recouped we went back to have good times in Margaritaville!  Yes, I am a Parrothead... :)"}
{"text":"After losing all your money in the casino, it's nice to get some value on the next wad you're going to blow on food.  

Fun atmosphere (not quiet if that's what you're looking for), fun little shows happening around you, girls swimming in giant vats of mixed drinks, and - oh yeah - good food!  

My advice, if you're not a big eater, buy one item and split it. The serve good sized portions.  I am a big eater but could have stopped when 1/2 the sandwich was gone and been fine.   (Of course I didn't, and paid for it later)."}
{"text":"Our waiter was super slow .. but the drinks and food were delicious. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was great."}
{"text":"Never really been a fan of any of the Margaritaville Restaurants and this one holds the same. I got a club sandwich. Yuck. The idea of a club sounds good, but when so much meat and bread is put on the sandwich, it's not only impossible to eat, but not good as well. Plus the meat was very cold.
Service wasn't good either. The guy was very slow in getting drinks as well as refilling them. 
We got to see a \"show\" which was kind of cool I guess. A lady came out of the volcano and spun around on a fish hook. Took my mind off the disgusting sandwich that I had. 
The last time I was at a Margaritaville, I told myself \"never again\". Well, I stupidly went against my own advice and ate here. But I'll say it again and hopefully listen to my own advice. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This is a \"must do\" if you're on the strip. 
The margaritas are pretty darn good. I guess that's what most people come for because the food is not the greatest I've ever had. 
I tried the Cuban sandwich which was \"fair\". 
The other two people with me tried the nachos and the quesadilla which they said was \"OK\". 
I think the food is just a way to keep people in after they've filled up on margaritas. I also think the food is a little overpriced."}
{"text":"So I came here on New Year's Day and it was packed!!!! But I kept hearing about this place so I wanted to try it. So we put our name on the list and it took 30min to an hour for them to seat our party of 7. We were seated near the stage.  I ordered the jumbalaya which was not that great and I wished I would have save my money. My friend also got the jumbalaya and she didnt like it either. 1 of my friends ordered the nachos and it was huge! I think everyone else ordered the quesdillas, which looked good, but I think I tasted it and it was just ok. Some came and brought flowers for the girls to put in our ear and they also tried to sell os these wooden bead necklaces wwhich the proceeds went to Save the Ta-Tas (a breast cancer foundation). While we were eating some hula dancers performed. Also since it was my friends birthday they sang and brought her ice crwam or something. The drinks were expensive there, so we just waited and went across the street to Ceaser's Palace for Fat Tuesday. Also the theme there was quite confusing, b/c since its called Margaritaville you would think Mexican food, but they had all types of food, but then they had polynesian dancers, that place was just confused. I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"Let me just say when I discovered this is where my friends wanted to go get some drinks on 4th of July I was not so thrilled at first.. Why? because I have had some encounters here in the past that werent EPIC but..my experience definitely changed after sitting down at the bar and being helped by Ryan. Not only was he spot on with his drink pours but he totally engaged me asked my name and has killer dimples and a smile that seems legit genuine.. I can only imagine nobody WANTS to spend their holiday pouring drinks to a bunch of tourists or WHINEY locals like myself haha but he asked my name... legit talked NBA trades with me and gave me excellent advice on drinks.. The Cadillac Margarita is to die for... I definitely recommend seeking out Ryan if youre at the bar.. Now if you are dining in I would ask for Tess... Why? because she legit was super friendly and was not even my server but had to go back and fourth to get drinks and food and stuff but she was still willing to give me good service ..  plus she scored points since she gave a smile back  when I gave one to her which as females we ALL know that is a Nice female and was friendly and genuinely happy to give me her name when I asked... This was a fun time where I was able to get a nice buzz while not being harassed by douche tards and even got some delicious drinks.. The house band plays some interesting stuff but it isn't terrible on the ears either.. I may have to venture back to see the water ladies dance sometime.... Anyhow whoever is staffing this place seems to be doing a good job keeping at least two of their employees happy because they did an epic job!"}
{"text":"Margaritas were just ok chips and salsa came out if a bag they were horrible and salty."}
{"text":"Punch me in the throat why don't you?
Twist the knife before you pull it out of my back!
This is a update of my review posted on July 6th for a questionable vist we experienced on the 4th of July.
I recived a reply from someone claiming to be the business owner, saying she was sorry and to contact her if I had any questions. Must of been bogus! We tried to contact her a couple of times with no success. They must be busy planning there next scam. If you have 100 seats, sell a 100 tickets not a 120 hoping some won't show. You made your money, beyond that is greed.
Once bitten, twice shy."}
{"text":"Whenever we are in Vegas, which is often, we go to Margaritatville. We were there July 8 and again the end of August. The Perfect and Uptown Margarita are just not like they use to be. A lot of mix, and less alcohol. One of the staff told us they had an issue with missing cases of tequila, and this is the reason drinks are not made as strong. The food and service remain good. Hopefully, they will listen to loyal customers, and return to the roots of making good drinks."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite on the Strip! The Volcano Nachos are incredible not to mention the margaritas!  

Of course, the Cheeseburger in Paradise is great as well.

Fun environment, but not a place to have a conversation.

Live entertainment in the evenings with stilt walkers..."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, stop by Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville on the Strip for happy hour. Two different margaritas for $5 and they pack a punch! It's nice to actually taste the alcohol in your drink! Had the quesadillas and the lava lava shrimp for $5 and $6 respectively. Both were great sizes and really yummy! Just a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Margaritas- uptown top shelf frozen was great! Heard on the rocks is even better. The perfect margarita was fantastic, small but great.

Food appetizers were all good and served a lot of. They don't short change on the portions. Wife ate the coconut shrimp and I had the Monterey chicken sandwich also very good. Service is great as well as cleanliness. If you love Buffet, good food and drinks this is a must do when in Vegas. 

Fins Up!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and tons of fun for the whole family. Every hour or so they do a little show that ends with a girl sliding down the volcano into a huge margarita glass. Not to mention their house margaritas are fabulous. You should try to sit in one of the boats, that is super fun. 

We started off with Asiago Crab Dip and substituted chips instead of bread, we all loved the taste and texture. Then I chose the Carne Asada Steak tacos for dinner. They had pico de gallo, cheese and cilantro on them. I ate every bite... So yummy! I tasted a few different items that my family choose and my favorite was the Seafood Mac and Cheese. Wow, simply divine! 

The service is adequate for a restaurant of this size and all the entertainment going on around you. Just prepare to wait a bit and enjoy the surroundings. The food will not disappoint you and just keep the drinks coming. Who doesn't like Jimmy Buffet? He is a legend and his restaurant will amaze you."}
{"text":"This place was exactly what I expected it to be. 

Palm trees, nautical nicknacks, colorful margaritas in oversize glasses. There were even an airplane and water-slide, though it's not open to patrons, which is just a tease. There is a show that they put on where a girl dressed as a mermaid dances around and slides down the water-slide and into a vat of \"margarita,\" which I'm sure is just water. FYI ... the tub of water that she slides into isn't very flattering for the girl. The distortion that the water created made me feel better about my own body lol.

The margaritas are good, as is to be expected. I had a regular margarita with a premium tequila since it was on special that night (it was a Wednesday). Very tasty. We didn't order entrees, but we did get a gigantic plate of nachos. And when I say gigantic, I mean GIGANTIC. One order of nachos could feed a small army, so keep that in mind. The nachos had chili, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapenos, tomatoes, and green onions. Very tasty! 

Margaritaville is a fun place to stop in for a bite to eat and a margarita!"}
{"text":"I didn't go to Margaritaville for the food, I went because I am a huge parrothead!  I love the atmosphere, and we met some friends for drinks.  I'd go back because I love the atmosphere... the food is average at best.  However, the waitstaff is always great."}
{"text":"Great view, lively atmosphere, decent food, friendly servers.

I came here on a Monday afternoon at an odd time (you know, between lunch and dinner) and was surprised to see it had a good amount of customers. I guess this attracts tourists because of the nice balcony seating upstairs, which has a strip view. 

Unfortunately I didn't try their famous margaritas because I was running on 2 hours of sleep, but I did try their Jamaican Jerk Chicken dish. Surprisingly it was decent and juicy. Not the BEST chicken, but decent enough. The sauce was on the side (not smothered) and was tasty. 

On my next visit, I wanna try the volcano nachos! Many people ordered it and it looks like it could feed a group of 6!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed myself here, but it's not a place you want to spend the entire night. It's better to stop by here as part of your Vegas crawl. Their exotic drinks were good, and the band was all right. This is a bit of a place for an older crowd. This one was a lot better than the one in Myrtle Beach for sure."}
{"text":"First time ever going to Vegas, my friends decided to drag me around on the first night where we to places where we could get into easily as it was already 1am. One of guys suggested margaritaville. I mean part of the reason why we went was because one of the guys in our group loves to dance with cougars to make them feel better about themselves. Personally i didn't think that there were that many there, but the margaritas were both good and strong. Not only that i got a guy to buy me a drink.  Go me!

Then again if the place is called Margaritaville, i do expect good margaritas. 

Weird music, not really danceable but we had a good time regardless."}
{"text":"We eat out a lot... I mean a lot. The food here was mediocre... serviced was ok... Way overpriced! The best part when we paid our bill we paid with a credit card and left a cash tip. The next day checking our bank there was an additional$20 charge on our card."}
{"text":"I can only give this place 1 star... For an OK pulled pork sandwich.... The conch fritters made both me and my girlfriend sick for days... The final straw was the fact that the flamingo has advertising the 20% discount on b-fast for rewards members and that they serve b-fast till 11 am... We get there at 10:35 and are told that they are in transition and can't serve us breakfast...   I thanked the young lady for saving me another potential food borne illness.... And went next door to imperial palace.... Hash house.... Most excellent.... Margaritaville??? Drink beer... Avoid the food."}
{"text":"Rene was our awesome server. We had brunch there on a Saturday morning. Good food for reasonable priced for Vegas (all food in Vegas is pricier than what we see in our home metro area). We would go back if we ever go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I just left Margaritaville in the Flats my first time and my last. We had a new server who was nice but not knowledgeable of the menu and that was fine I ordered Fish and chips and my friend ordered Jambalaya Without the sausage then we were told they don't make it that way so he ordered the shrimp linguine. Well here's the problem he got his food 5 minuets later and my fish and chips never came. We had to stand and wave our hands to get someone attention the MGR. who apologize and 20 minutes later my food came. The mgr. took it off my bill however I still had to yell for someone again to get water. Really!! There was no one but us in the restaurant there was no excuse for this service even from a new person. The manager never checked back to see if we were satisfied. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"It's been 5 years since we have been here and I don't know how many people I have told they should give this place a try if they are coming to Vegas. 

Never again. It's gone downhill in those 5 years. The menu isn't what it used to be, and I found the food pretty disappointing. The restaurant still has a cool interior with some tables that look like boats. Not sure if they still do the shows as we may just have been too early. That was part of the charm when we came before.

We definitely won't ever go back."}
{"text":"It's alright.

We each ordered Cheeseburgers in Paradise...with bacon. They were cooked to order and tasted fine.

My onion rings (+$1) were delicious, but they were just as oily as any other place's rings would be having been yanked out of the fryer. Tried my friend's fries, and they were good too.

We split an order of coconut shrimp with the marmalade sauce - DELICIOUS!

We each had the add-a-salad too. It was a fresh, very simple salad, with seedy little cut-in-half teardrop tomatoes. I had mine with mango ranch (for authenticity's sake) and I enjoyed it.

We ordered tea to drink. They're generous with the lemon wedge, and they kept up with the refills for us just fine!

Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville is a very thematic place, as is everything in Las Vegas. It is enjoyable. It's a pleasant, fun and exciting atmosphere offering up \"just average\" to \"really good\" food."}
{"text":"Fun tables. A great place to play blackjack and have fun!
A very small casino next to the Flamingo."}
{"text":"Margaritaville is great for what it is:  the physical manifestation of Jimmy Buffett's songs and life.  I sort of have a special place in my heart for a few of those songs, my dad listened to Jimmy Buffett all the time during my formative years.   However, after watching Buffett videos for 45 minutes during lunch, I have come to the realization that I am slightly creeped out by Jimmy Buffett.  Not sure exactly why, but I am.  

Anyway, the food was good enough, exactly what you would expect from a big box, semi corporate kinda place.  I got the perfect margarita and it was great.  Super strong, not sweet at all.  Dont get it if you want a traditional margarita, my friend got one and tearing up as he choked it down.  I like the taste of tequila, so I loved it."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Took a customer there....sat at bar.  Asked about fajitas and server said they were having problems with their steak and steak wasn't available....got the carribean salad without dressing.  Salad came drenched in dressing and was very mediocre at best.  Even before we were finished, bartender told us he was leaving and wanted us to pay bill.  He could of just transferred it but told us he couldn't do it and wanted us to pay and open new bill if we wanted anything else.  So for that, he got a mediocre tip!  And as we were leaving I saw steak fajitas being served!  Nice!  Would not go back!"}
{"text":"Margaritaville is definitely a tourist spot, you can get a free entree if you use one of the coupons from the Vegas booklet. 

The restaurant is located inside the Flamingo Hotel and is about 3 floors high with 4 bar areas. There are performers in stilts that go around from tale to table making balloon animals and other fun things for kids and patrons. I thought they would pass our table by but I was glad when they stopped by. 

For dinner I had the ribs and french fries, a common thing that I order a touristy spots, and it was a good choice. We both ordered their margaritas and that's when I realized you can walk around with an open container so we took the unfinished drinks to go."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell you how it was, we showed up 2 minutes past 9 pm on a sunday night and they refused to sit us down, bummer"}
{"text":"So awesome! And Jennifer is a super cool waitress. She is so funny."}
{"text":"Awesome food, atmosphere, and service!  Get there early so you don't have to wait for a table.  So good!"}
{"text":"We had the second floor as part of a dinner a client was throwing. They were generous with the liquor and considering this client I was grateful for that.

The appetizers were good and the pulled pork was delicious but it was CRAZY LOUD.

It was scream across the table and barely be understood kind of loud.

It was \"I wish they'd turn it from from building shaking to just ear splitting\" kind of loud.

It was just give up and write notes on a napkin kind of loud.

If you're deaf and have been looking for a place where everyone else is just like you....You just found it."}
{"text":"We visited Margaritaville a few times during our stay in Vegas last weekend.  I thought that overall--the food was a great value for the price--for Vegas anyway and the drinks were yummy!  

I would suggest that they add a Mojito to the drink menu tho....come-on now!!...get some damn mint!!

The 3rd floor is great for people watching, the guy on stilts is cool and I really liked the whole decor of the place.  

Service on the whole was very good!

Gift shop is, of course, extremely overpriced but whatcha gonna do....

There were some anirondack chairs in the hallway into the giftshop that seemed to have a mysterious effect on anyone who sat down in them--whenever we walked past the chairs there was at least one person totally zonked out sleeping with mouth open---musta had one too many perfect margaritas....."}
{"text":"This bar is awesome because of Kevin and Billy! They are amazing!  We came here for an afternoon drink on an anniversary trip to Vegas.  My girlfriend and I came here while our guys were dune buggy riding.  We had a blast!  They were entertaining and super nice!"}
{"text":"Waited 25 mins. because we were told we had to and the signage also states it. After finally being sat, multiple tables around us were taken up by people who just came i and did not wait.  The staff hurriedly cleaned tables and did not tell them to report to the hostess nor were they seated by the hostess.  We wanted a Cadillac margarita, the waitress tried to tell us the Cointreau was what made the cAdillac.  We said no it's grand marnier but she insisted it was the Cointreau.  Needless to say it was not a Cadillac.  The nachos left a lot to be desired as well.  Very little meat and toppings. A huge bowl of chips with Guac and sour cream and jalepeno a on top. Disappointing visit .  The live band however made up for the negative but not enough to get beyond two stars."}
{"text":"We went to Margaritaville Cafe on the Monday, right before we left for the airport.

It was really fun inside, but the food wasnt anything spectacular and it smelled funny-like a bar in Mexico. I wish we would have gone there when we were in the mood to drink because their margarita menu was insane!Never seen so many options in my life. I got the California Chicken Sandwich which was alright, but their fries were the best part-vvveeryyy yummy.

Good place for kids/big parties. Honestly the best part about it was the video playing on the overhead projector of drunk people making fools out of themselves on tape....very entertaining;)"}
{"text":"Came early for lunch on a Thursday. Got seated way over in a back corner all by myself. Not sure way. Honestly seems like the worst seat here. Can't really see any of the decor or screens.

Got the fish taco plate. Tacos themselves were great. Rice was undercooked. By quite a bit. 

Getting my order taken took a while. If you're a buffet fan, get on it. Otherwise, skip it."}
{"text":"So disappointing. I love the other Margaritaville I've visited and always had a blast there. 

Maybe, it's Vegas that ruined the Margaritaville experience for me! The wait is bs! We stopped by on Thursday around 2pm and there were open tables but there was an hour wait. Huh? I could clearly see that there were open tables....HMMMM....Maybe this location is trying to hype itself up by making their guests wait and make it appear that they have a wait list. 

We definitely passed and won't ever come back to this location."}
{"text":"As far as places for kids on the strip, we have mainly just gone to one other particular restaurant that I won't mention here. However, we had heard the Margaritaville was a neat place for kids. Well we decided to give it a try. We have been to some of the other Margaritaville Restaurants around the country so we knew what to expect. But it was a fantastic experience. They have cool people on stilts walking around making balloon hats and creations for big (adults) and little kids alike. They also have a cool Jurassic World menu right now. We had the loaded chips which were fantastic by the way. I had the fish tacos, my wife had the buttermilk fried chicken, the kids had the dino nuggets. Everyone enjoyed their food. My wife said that the buttermilk fried chicken was some of the best she had every had (that's saying something, she is SUPER PICKY). The service was phenomenal, to the point where when they found out we were locals, they told us about all of their other events. Our waiter, I think his name was Jeff (sorry not-Jeff if I got your name wrong), was fantastic and attentive and friendly. Could not have asked for better service. Very good and we will be back, but maybe we will wait until EDC is over. For the kids, the sights of the people waiting in line for the Box Office we a little too much."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend, Dad and brother and we would all recommend it. 

Overall it was a good experience. We got seated quickly, the server was attentive and polite, and the food was good. The seafood Mac & cheese was excellent. 

It was a very fun atmosphere and the place is well decorated. After dinner we went to the rooftop bar and were quickly served drinks with a great view. 

Not sure why there are so many bad reviews on here, we all enjoyed it and I would definitely return. 

I was surprised how big of a place it is because it's absolutely huge. Not sure how they thought that was a good idea, can't see them keeping it full enough to support the venue but I hope they hang in there."}
{"text":"This is always a fun place to come when your in Vegas.   We enjoyed the service, the show,   the music, the margaritas.   Some of the performance staff stopped by and talked with us and our server was a lot of fun.   Food is not bad."}
{"text":"There are some restaurants in Vegas that flash tourist trap, tourist trap, and yes we fell into this one.  WIth a coupon for $5 off from our hotel, we had our first meal in Vegas at the famous Margarittaville.  It's not the same as going to the one in Jamaica where you are in a hot locale and it seems like the right place to hear Margarittaville but the menu seemed the same. You walk in and you are likely to see large screens with either music videos, or recordings of Jimmy singing in different venues.  It's a bit loud but that is to be expected.  You'll probably see one of 3 people on stilts walking around.  I'm not really sure their purpose besides being available for picture taking and the occasional dance to a song.

I decided on the fish tacos; two tacos with lettuce, grilled fish, and sour cream, served with chips and salsa for $15.99.  The fish could have used a little more flavour but overall they were pretty tasty.  My husband ordered steak and I asked him to add the coconut shrimp for an extra $6 so I can try it.  Three shrimp with a tangy sauce accompanied his meal and they were good but I was glad it wasn't my meal as it would have been too much shrimp and sauce.

I don't think this place needs to be visited more than once during a stay in Vegas and once every few years is probably enough considering all the great places to eat.  But this time, I wasn't disappointed and our server was friendly and provided great service."}
{"text":"This is always on my list of places to eat at when in Vegas. Love their Coconut Shrimp! Nachos are great too! Margaritas are delicious! Can't go wrong with eating here! Music can be a tad too loud & it makes it hard to hear the waiter or the people you are dining with but its a fun place to eat at!"}
{"text":"Went to Margaritaville for the first time today (Saturday about 1pm) for a friends birthday celebration.  The host was friendly and our party of 9 was seated right away.  I loved how open and spacious the restaurant was and the live music gave it an island feeling.  The decorations had me feeling like I was somewhere other then Cleveland! 

My husband ordered a pina colada, which was just ok- it lacked flavor and seemed watered down.  The birthday girl ordered a margarita in a take home blender and she said it was delicious!  My husband and I shared the chicken egg rolls (appetizer) and the chicken fajitas.  Both were good but nothing amazing.  Our server and service was great.  

Afterwards, we all headed up to the roof top bar which was awesome!  Love the tropical vibe and the views from the city.  

If you plan on visiting make sure you bring cash to park.  It was $10 and they did not accept credit cards.

Overall, I would recommend this place for a unique vibe, live island music, and an overall great atmosphere.  Don't come expecting the food to be amazing and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you go in for theme restaurants,this one is tops. A neat place to take people--if you can,ask to sit inside one of the boats!  Kids love this place.But be forewarned-if you are having a nice lunch or dinner in one of the 'boats',you may get some uninvited company in the form of rambunctious children who don't belong to you wanting to play on it(We did!!) -but that's more about the parents of said children.
This is definitely a fun place-nice bar,and a store attached when you are done eating or waiting to do so. Overall, I think the drinks are good,the food is fine,-it's good,just not great. The nachos are huge,as in tall. I've had better food-it's a bit more hype than substance in some ways. The wait staff seems to be very friendly."}
{"text":"Margueritaville has such a great, fun atmosphere.  (It's unfortunate the Margueritaville in Key West doesn't have anywhere near the same spirit.)  And each time I visit I'm surprised by how large a place this is.  Downstairs is a Keys beachfront bar; upstairs is a Keys house, with even kind of a treehouse vibe.  (Although maybe that's generally the margueritas speaking?  Speaking of which...)  The margueritas are expensive but excellent, and there're a wide variety of them.  The staff is very welcoming and will keep you entertained or leave you alone as much as you'd like.  The food is good, but the attraction here is definitely the atmosphere and the margueritas.  Oh, and of course the music -- live or otherwise, it just feeds the joy around the place."}
{"text":"Incredible drinks and bartenders are top notch not to mention the vibe and music is always cool. People watch drink eat meet people ......
Been coming for years can't believe it took me this long to write a review."}
{"text":"Margarita flight is good but mango margaritas are the best.  Stopped in for a drink and the bartender has just made a flight for display.  Perfect for sharing on Valentine's Day.  Bartender didn't keep hounding us and we sat in the little bar area watching people and the fountains.   Great spot!  I will definitely make a point to go there again for the mango margarita.  It was that light, refreshing and easy to drink."}
{"text":"Great place with great food and ultra strong drinks IF you know what to order(perfect margarita).

The food is always excellent and plentiful, the margaritas are strong yet decently priced for the strip, and the entertainment is top notch now that they finally started to change the TVs to the patrons request! 5 stars, no doubt!

Highly recommended:

Appetizers-
Coconut Shrimp APP
Blue crab & Cheese APP(I like to substitute chips)
Volcano Nachos(if you're dining with a crowd)
Entrees-
Mahi Mahi
Jerk Salmon
Burgers
Cuban Sandwich
Jambalaya is pretty good as well"}
{"text":"Had this review saved up for awhile...lol

The first restaurant I ate at for my first time at Vegas (woo EDC! EDC!)

It was SUPER busy, but no one wanted to sit outside because it was hella hot and we said we didn't mind so we got sat right away. The food was pretty decent and for as busy as it was, it came out in a decent amount of time. I forgot I we drank but it was frozen. And on a hot day, nothing beats frozen drinks and booze."}
{"text":"Best French Dip sandwich I ever had. Gf had the Cobb salad and said it was phenomenal. Said the freshest avocado she ever had."}
{"text":"Quite poor, actually.  I ordered the $20 mahi mahi and it was junk.  It was way too salty, and the vegetables that came on the side were barely cooked.  The only thing good about the meal was the glass of white zinfandel I had.  Others at my table were only mildly impressed with their dishes too.  With so many amazing dining choices in Vegas, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of gluten free choices. We just got to Vegas and we were hungry. Ordered the volcano nachos. It took about 45 minutes. Really!? They were nachos. Nothing complex. Our waitress told the manager how long it took (we never complained once) and next thing I know, they comped our entire meal. Sweet! Thank you for taking care of us."}
{"text":"Margaritaville is always consistant good food friendly staff .. The only this is at this restaurant as you walk in from the street or from the casino theres really No guidance as to if you seat yourself or walk all the way around to the other side to sit at a table if maybe they made some cool Beachy Buffet signs on the wall or stairs in front may help travelers if you've never been to this specific restaurant before ......... still a great spot to have a cold one...."}
{"text":"My Aunt and Uncle were visiting from out of town and we were thinking of a fun place to take them to. I have been to Margaritaville a few times but it has been about 3 years ago. I thought they would enjoy the atmosphere and the floor show they have with the volcano and the girl sliding down into the big margarita pitcher. Here is a list of my total experience there:
1. Called ahead and got priority seating which worked out good- highly recommend I did ask about the balcony outside but it was closed that night. No problem I thought they will enjoy the floor show

2. Ordered Chicken Caesar Salad- Not very big- soggy crouton and some soggy lettuce chicken was good but not very much.

3. Waited all through dinner to see the floor show(see above).after dinner the lights dimmed the margarita pitcher started to change color and bubble. The volcano started to steam- oh the anticipation!!! Then it stopped- that was it!!!! Asked our waiter who said that the water was bad! What? Very disappointing after talking it up to the relatives!!! 

I don't know when we will be back but I won't order that salad and I will call and ask about the show!"}
{"text":"We came here after a nice morning with a couple of drinks at nearby 5 o'clock somewhere. They don't serve food but luckily this place is right next to it so we came here for some brunch.

We ordered the steak and eggs ($17.99) which is a good to share for two people. Is there anything special about it? Not really. It was your typical eggs, hash browns, toast, and steak. The steak was more well done so it was a bit dry but overall it was just okay."}
{"text":"Definitely amazing food and drinks but good lord, I'm sure I'm not the only one upset about a 35.00 drink when the \"blender\" it came in was plastic and cost probably 5 cents to make."}
{"text":"Cinco De Mayo!

We got here for an early lunch, the bar area was already full so we opted to sit in the restaurant.

We lucked out and ended up sitting in the boat for the first time.

Even though they had Margarita specials I ended up buying the perfect margarita for $12.50 I believe. For meals, I had the BBQ burger and my wife had the JIMMY´S JAMMIN´ JAMBALAYA which was about $20.00.  

The BBQ burger was cooked just like I asked -well done and the apple wood bacon was unbelievable!
That made the burger well worth it. The fries were crunchy just how we like them!

My wife never had Jambalaya, I think she counted 4-5 shrimps and liked the sausage. It was just enough spice for her. 

The margarita itself was very very strong. I only had one and it set me straight for a few hours or should I say crooked :) Margaritaville is truly one of our favorite spots for margaritas!!

We will be back soon for my Bday :)"}
{"text":"been here a twice on 2 separate trips. Food is good. Service was average. Noise so loud that i couldn't take to the person sitting 2ft from me."}
{"text":"I love Margaritaville... But definitely not impressed with this visit. I was really looking forward to some Volcano  Nachos, but being by myself, I knew I couldnt eat the whole thing. I requested a half order, but was told they couldnt do that. I understand this policy if there is a large group, but not so much if"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, not great food. The place is fun. Plenty of games, including major beer pong. The service was ok. Wish the food was better, drinks were good!"}
{"text":"If this place only served the Yard-a-rita (a gi-normous yard tall test tube of Margarita with a spout at the bottom), then I'd give it 4 stars.  If they only served food, I'd give them 2 stars.  So I averaged it out.

If  you are going to call one of your dishes \"Cheeseburger in Paradise,\" then it better be the best damn cheeseburger on the planet, and frankly, it is just ok.  

My sister ordered a pasta with chicken in alfredo sauce.  I'm sure they took 5 frozen dinners out of the freezer, zapped them, and put them in a dish.

If a drunk guy doesn't think the food is fantastic then there's a problem.

This is a tourist trap, plain and simple.  It's only saving grace is the monster margarita that could serve a small country, or Maryland.  We didn't even finish it (we were already quite saucy).  I had to hand the drink off to the table next to us as I stumbled out the door."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner was immediately seated and had an overall great experience. The appetizers and food came out fairly quickly and the service was 4 of 5 stars. The man serving us seemed a bit annoyed.. other than that I would recommend :)"}
{"text":"A standard Margaritaville. Pretty clean, huge and drinking friendly. I especially loved the drinking deck, a patio esque area where smokers ad drunkards can watch the foot traffic just below on the strip sidewalk."}
{"text":"After dining here twice I would say it's not a must visit.  This place is located on the expensive part of the strip and it's not high quality food.  Sucks to say that i didn't try a margarita at Margaritaville but my tab was already too high for my liking."}
{"text":"Came to hear Troy play. Enjoyed the appetizer trio and BBQ ribs. Both were large enough to split between 2 people. Food was warm and excellent. It is load so having a nice quiet conversation is not going to happen but it is a nice party atmosphere. The only change would be to have the baseball game on instead of videos while there is live music playing."}
{"text":"We were on vacation stopped in for St Patrick's day drinks and had a great time. The service was perfect and the volcano nachos were above expectations"}
{"text":"I cannot give it any better.  This place is not worth your time.  Food is nothing special, I can make a better Italian dish.  The server screwed up on my order.  No really great beers either.
They had entertainment there, with dudes walking around on stilts and a damsel in distress that does gymnastics on this scenic volcano.  It was entertaining, but this is Vegas.  
I order one Pomegranate margarita and it was terrible.  Way too sweet, I could taste the syrup and not the alcohol.  It wasn't strong at all.  Trust me, I would know.
The pasta dish I order with chicken and they brought it out with shrimp.  I like shrimp too, so I just decided to eat it anyway, since the server was lame and non-attentive.  I can make a better pasta dish myself, so Margaritaville YOU FAIL."}
{"text":"So first off I was the only person under 30 that wasn't there with my parents. It's an older crowd. I had a bacon cheese burger fries and a big ass margarita. Saw that you can get them in a blender cup amd asked since it's not on the regular menu. The waitress was super nice and brought me the blender cup menu. She even suggested I get it on the rocks b/c it would be stronger. The frozen drinks come pre-made. She was rt, I got fucked up! I suggest the big chill which is blue. Everything was awesome and I highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"The drinks were Amazing.  The food was so-so.  It wasn't anything special and was like any other typical chain restaurant (i.e. Chilis, Applebees, etc).  The service was actually really friendly and the food arrived faster than I anticipated.  

HOWEVER, the entertainment was a HOT MESS.  The people walking around with stilts were scary, awkward, out of place, and I felt was irrelevant to the theme...unless the theme was \"tacky\".   And then there was this hot mess of a \"waiter\" dancing around to the music and doing some flashdance ridiculous dance routine while trying to \"pump up\" the customers.  I was not impressed.  After 10 minutes of painfully sitting through the awkward dancing, the lady climbs the roof of the bar and then slides into a green margarita tank that supposedly resembled a blender.  WTF?  Bad choreography, bad music, and seriously...I lost my appetite watching some hot mess of a girl swimming half naked in a green blender right near my food.  I clapped when the \"performance\" was over, only because I was thankful that she left the floor and I don't need her dripping around my food."}
{"text":"This place always looks crowded from the outside. Hmmm if its this crowded all the time, this place must be a great place to check out! Or maybe not. 

Did I just get a kids cup of beer for $6?  

Why is it crowded outside but not inside? Maybe everyone is trying to leave the place but no one is moving out the way! 

I wonder if the food is good here though, because the wings and nachos looked good. 

Time to move on. I was out of there as soon as I got my drink."}
{"text":"First off, Sean is the shit. Love the food and the service is amazing! I'll miss you Margaritaville when I leave vegas!!"}
{"text":"First stop in Vegas after putting down our bags and changing.  The stars are for the drinks.  AMAZING frozen drinks of all kinds, not just the margaritas.  I wish there was a place in NY that made frozen drinks this good.

We sat down and had lunch, which was okay.  There was a wait and it wasn't even that busy.  Overpriced for the quality/quantity (but it is Vegas).  My friend's chicken was undercooked, so she sent it back and the waitress brought out a new sandwich and took it off the bill, which I thought was pretty nice.

Will definitely be back this summer for drinks, not for food."}
{"text":"LOVED THIS MEAL. They have numerous gluten free items, even gluten free fries and a dessert option! It's a fun place to eat or grab a drink. It's a bit more expensive than other places to eat but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"If I can give it no star this would be it.  Met up with friends here for dinner and drinks.  The music was loud but was okay that we can hear each other.  Then a few minutes later it got so loud that we asked to be seated elsewhere.
I asked for a blended mango margarita with Patron and they said they can't do that since all their slush drinks are pre-mixed.  So, changed it to on the rocks.  
To the point, it was horrible , had to send it back the music got louder and louder that we had to yell at one another to the breaking point we decided not to talk and get the hell out of there!"}
{"text":"I loved it. Especially since I am a Jimmy Buffet fan.  Great food, I got a salad.  Great atmosphere, errupting volcano, stilt dancers. Good margaritas cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"So we were in Vegas last week and stayed at the Flamingo.  One night we decided to check this place out.  It was odd that it was advertised by the Flamingo as one of their restaurants, but you have to walk outside the hotel to get inside this place.  

Inside there is a nice bar area with a list of many different margaritas, hence... never mind you should already know.  Anyway... the inside decor is unique; with fishing boats that you can eat in, fishing poles, big plastic fish and what not.  There was also a stage, but there wasn't anything going on that night.  

Atmosphere: 4
Service: 4
Food: 3.8 (Jerk Chicken=Spicy. but good see pic)"}
{"text":"Great food !  Kent give us the best service. Today. The volcano nachos they are huge. Plus  the beach club sandwich was so good too.    Iam impressed.  And for first time in my life. I found the best napkins  in the world !!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. We brought our family here and the food was great. I had the corn and clam chowder soup and it was delicious.  This would be a great place for families visiting Vegas. My kids liked all the cool stuff to look at and the people on stilts walking around who were making balloon hats and figures for them.  One of the best places we went to eat during our visit to Vegas with our family."}
{"text":"I came not because I'm a Jimmy Buffett fan but because I was looking for some adult beverages on the Strip and the menu looked good too. My mother and I arrived on a Saturday night around 8 and waited somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes for a table, which is really not bad considering it was Saturday. I did not know this place was so huge, there are 3 floors! There is also a gift shop that we strolled through while waiting for our table, as well as talked to an employee there; they have men walking around on stilts, dressed in sailor costumes (think Popeye). That was entertaining enough. The huge margarita tubs behind the bar are cool to look at.

Anyway there is not too much to say. Our waiter was prompt despite a packed house, our food and drinks were good, the atmosphere is casual and I enjoyed the tv's everywhere playing the music video for whatever song happened to be playing on their playlist. It may be outdated but I still like watching music videos. I feel for the prices we should have gotten more food though; everything was good but the quantity did not match the prices. For the record we had a shrimp cocktail (Peel N Eat Shrimp), Coconut Shrimp, and the BBQ Pork Sandwich. No complaints about our food otherwise. I had a margarita which was good and I think my mom had a beer. It IS the Strip and we had fun so it's a give and take. Next time I will probably sit at the bar exclusively for drinks and maybe some appetizers. I'm not running back to Margaritaville but will be there again sometime.

I was really between 2 and 3 stars, and although the food was good it really can be found elsewhere, so that bumped it down to a 2 for me."}
{"text":"C'mon jimmy!! Are you serious? You've got enough money. What a sad effort for the franchise. It was like eating in an actual fish tank. Big square building painted blue with a couple palm trees and a boat for all us bottom feeders to come in and spend way too much on below average food. Seems like the whole thing was a mad effort to capitalize on this summer's yuppy crowd. Probably a good thing though. I'm guessing the entire area will be wasted away again by 2019."}
{"text":"WOW! great margaritas and food. After walking the strip we needed to cool down and get something to eat so we ended up here. Excellent place, pleasant staff, great food, wonderful drinks and atmosphere. We ended up staying for over two hours just drinking and enjoying the videos and music. Definitely a great place to relax and wind down from the mad house on the strip."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Monday afternoon was seated at the bar.  Wasn't sure what I wanted due to all the different choices.  Our bartender Kala made a few great recommendations and let us sample a few options.   I went wt a strawberry mango Margarita and finished off wt a blueberry pomegranate Margarita.  Both were amazing but the blueberry one was THE BEST.   Thank you Kala for your recommendations and fun conversation."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are to die for! My drink was a bit strong but still amazingly good and the burgers were to good to just eat one (if I had any room left in my stomach that is!)"}
{"text":"In our 2 visits to Margaritaville I will have to say I have not been disappointed. Now I will be the first one to admit that we usually get sucked into the chain restaurants and the majority of the time it is just bad. But maybe it was the tequila in my drinks but the food each time was great. Each time we have started off with the Nachos. Seriously after eating them I should not have ordered an entree but I did anyway and remember leaving there stuffed. On Friday and Saturday nights it is for sure a party atmosphere in there."}
{"text":"Ten cent wing Thursdays! Not the best wings, but pretty damn good and real cheap!"}
{"text":"Like everything in Las Vegas, Margaritaville is a dining escape in and of itself.  Compelling decor ripped right from the legendary Jimmy Buffet songs give you a change in latitude from the moment you walk in.   This large restaurant manages an intimate feel through themed areas throughout.  Live entertainment from enthusiastic performers entertain without offending... this is someplace where Bachelorette Parties and Families will feel equally at home. 

Do not miss the Volcano Nachos which are nearly a meal in and of themselves.  We shared the Coconut Shrimp and the Fish Tacos; both were fresh and satisfying. 

We loved being able to sample the 4 Margaritas before settling in on the Mango and a Classic.

But what sets this restaurant apart from other restaurants on the strip, is the gracious hospitality.  This staff is having fun!  And they want you to have fun!   There's absolutely not a hint of arrogance or the you're-not-cool-enough-to-eat-here vibe that's so common on the Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Poor communication between staff, rude managers, poor service spent 4 hours waiting for a table waiting for a server and waiting for food. Save your self the trouble and go somewhere else until they get staffed properly. I have been to other margaritaville's and they were fabulous this one gives the brand a bad name. Will never return to this location. Overpriced food for poor service. They should close until the figure out how to run a business. Tried to bribe us with chips and salsa after waiting for food an hour and a half later."}
{"text":"So again we are always looking for a happy hour if a place doesn't have a happy hour we make our own. We really went for a small bite and drink and more of the view and being outside. This did not disappoint of course we had margaritas and split a trio. Spinach artichoke dip, egg rolls and chicken tenders not my favorite kinds of food but we were walking home so at least I was able to justify the extra calories. The view upstairs outside is definitely worth a visit. Not sure I'd go back to eat but small snack is good."}
{"text":"Only had 1 bad drink in vegas, and it was a mango margarita from the walk up bar.  Bar tender was nice and place has great atmosphere but margarita was so sugary couldn't drink it.  Burned my throat and my friend threw his away too.  Not what I expected from margaritaville."}
{"text":"We were very excited to come to margaritaville for the first time and ended up being very disappointed. We went to the hostess to get seated and there were 5 of us and we asked if we could sit outside. The hostess said no because they only can seat a table of 4 outside which was fine and we then asked if it's ok if we split up to sit outside and she still said no which was odd. She came back over to us and was incredibly rude and basically yelling at us for no reason. We left and went somewhere else in the flats because why would we want to stay somewhere the service is awful and the people working incredibly rude? Makes me definitely not want to come back."}
{"text":"Big margaritas which I love. Thats about it. It's just much too touristy for me and its right on the strip."}
{"text":"Went here the other day so I could feel like a tourist... it definitely put me in that \"I'm on vacation\" kind of mood. The wait sucked, but once we sat down we found the food to be decent. Nachos were pretty good, but coming from Texas I've eaten far better nachos in my day... bigger doesn't always mean better! Drinks were decent but pricey (when on the strip one can't be in denial, you have to learn to accept that all drink prices suck!). 

Atmosphere was incredibly cheesey.. but it will put you in that vacation mood!"}
{"text":"A great spot for brunch with a hangover. Really dark, soothing music, and decent grub. I tried the \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" (not quite paradise, but decent). Amy wen't for the Chicken California sandwich and did much better. I enjoyed a bowl of Corn & Crab Chowder but not the $50 lunch tab. When we were waiting for our food to come out I noticed everyone was ordering massive plates of Nachos, I will do the same if I eat here again."}
{"text":"Gotta love some Jimmy Buffet and I do, but there is a limit to everything.!  But when on a girls-weekend..its perfect. The nachos are good..believe what you hear. They can feed 4 easy, so order accordingly. I had a ham panini - it was actually one of the best meals I had all week. Kinda of a Cuban panini... tasty. One chick had the Wedge Louie Salad.. she wasnt that impressed. The iceberg didn't look that great. Another had chicken wings, they were a hit. Service was friendly and considering the crowd, speedy enough. The deco is fun and makes you want to go to Florida. The Margaritaville casino is 'cute' but wasn't very busy. The food is solid, well priced for the portions. A good deal on the strip."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. Decor is something to see but the food is basic. Went in because the wait everywhere else was long. 
I had the bbq burger. Nothing special. I think it is overpriced; there is better in town. 
Friend had the French dip. Said it was very good. 
Would have gave 3 stars but no one there wanted to smile on Saturday afternoon. 
Some of the others folks there said to come for the drinks and appetizers. Nachos are supposed to be good."}
{"text":"Yummy!!  I love this place!  Such a fun place to go with friends for lunch, dinner or out for late night drinks! 

Pretty much everything on the menu (both food and drink) is yum-yum-YUMMY!  From the tortilla soup, to the nachos, to the fish tacos, to the burgers...it's all delicious!   

It's located in the heart of the new Westgate plaza in Glendale., AZ so there are plenty of things to do before or after your meal.  I high recommend checking Margaritaville out!  Oh and I forgot to mention the great tunes!  You can't go wrong with the Jimmy Buffett songs!  \"I like Pina Coladas!\""}
{"text":"A group of us were planning to meet up at Margaritaville to drink Margarita's and eat dinner. By the time my group got there the others had gone bar hoping.
After being tired from walking the convention center and not eating this was to be the meal of the day. The waiter was very attentive and nice and was from Stockton if memory serves. He told me that the ribs could be dry and not all the people like them but I was hungy so I ordered them. 
The problem I thought was the ribs were not dry but they were salty like the french frys which must of been to make people drink more.  The sauce was interesting but I have had better.Overall the food was so-so but the prices were a little pricy. I spend about 22.00 for the ribs.
The only thing that was cool was that on the hour a woman jumps into a large margarita glass and the song of Margaritaville Plays it could be cool if your drunk.
When I left I did order a margarita to go and thought it was just as good as the one I get from Paris Hotel  in the Effiel Tower glass and for the same amount."}
{"text":"Order two margaritas for ($23)Add Nachos ($16) waiter notices you have finished your drinks and raves about their \"Wasting Away\" margarita which you order being thirsty and a bit tipsy. He brings a fake blender full of pink colored liquid ($33) You notice almost everyone in the place has done the same. The bill comes to $72.00 and you haven't had dinner yet!  You don't seem to care and imagine you have \"gone sailing\" like Jimmy Buffet says on the loud speakers."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with my friend and I's visit to Vegas Maragritaville. We were in a bit of a rush to get brunch before the 2016 iHeart Village. Our friends were already there and my girlfriend and I needed to eat. The waiting line wasn't that long, we waited maybe ~15 minutes. 

We were quickly hustled to one of the tables that luckily overlooked the Strip. We sat down, and took a quick glance at their short breakfast/brunch menu all before our waiter came by. Both of us decided on a fun and fruity brunch drink and the general breakfast platter of eggs/sausage/toast/potatoes. 

Figured it wouldn't take long since they were turning tables over quickly. Wasn't the case at all. It was a struggle to find our server once he took our order, he just kind of disappeared. Other servers took care of us (food and drink delivery, water refills, etc) and no one had an explanation for his disappearing act. Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but we must've waited a good 30-45 minutes AFTER that for food. We received no apology nor explanation for the delay. That would've been nice. 

The drinks were nice and the food was bland. Overall it could be summed up as a \"blah\" experience."}
{"text":"Our server Alisha was amazing! Super fun, nice, and made great recommendations!! Will definitely go back! Just don't mistake her for Ashley:) lol"}
{"text":"We went to Margaritaville and it was great. We had a great cocktail waitress named Claire. She made sure we had what we wanted and was attentive to our drink and food needs. Claire was fun and engaging. She also gave us drink suggestions and they were really good. I'm going back for the World of Concrete and hope that Claire is working then. My friends and colleagues and I appreciate the quality service that Margaritaville and Claire provides."}
{"text":"This review is for a visit back in November 2015. The food was mediocre at best as was the service, and that is being kind especially at the price point. save your money and go elsewhere, if you can find one ask a local where they go."}
{"text":"There is a hidden gem in the far back corner of the restaurant. A bar! Avoided a wait for a table and Kwame, the bartender was very helpful and friendly. We snagged a coupon for a free margarita from the Flamingo concierge!"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy great company with great drinks and food yeah he
Wahoo yippee:) :)"}
{"text":"this place was a disappointment...

i mean u always pass this place while drivin down the strip and u see the gang of people hangin out on the balcony and they seem like they are having a blast.
so as one of our main stops on our bar run this place was MEhhhh....
we had to toss our drinks before headin in...so our boys downed their beers. we show ID.. get in and the place is biiiiig, they had live music but it wasnt that great that nite, they have ONE type of margarita for all i could tell and no hugeeeee long cups...hello i thot they would have it? and shutup up i AM a tourist...psh

so after a few tiny cups of beers we left and continued our journey because it wasnt worth staying..."}
{"text":"Touristy, the wings were good the martini flight was small but ok. Atmosphere was ok, I would say too pricey for my liking."}
{"text":"Food is ok but very expensive. I guess everything is expensive in Las Vegas nowadays! There were three of us that went for lunch. Our tab ended up being 102 plus tax! That was just for lunch. It was pretty empty too for being such a big place. And the waiter kept on apologizing saying he can get in trouble for various reasons, it was weird. He was a great waiter but made it sound like they are pretty strict with them!"}
{"text":"Prices are good and came for a band which was great. The service however is inconsistent and who and how many drinks they will serve varies based on the bartender. If you have policies no problem but they need to be enforced consistently or not be in place. I will continue to come for shows but would recommend only coming if you understand the poor service you will receive."}
{"text":"I was not planning on coming here but my friend's family took us here and they're awesome company. There was a bit of a wait so we looked around the gift shop. On the way there, I was heckled by the bartender for wearing a Kevin Durant shirt. Ninja, puh-leez!

5 O'Clock Somewhere:
Rum, passion fruit tequila, sour mix, OJ, pineapple juice, and grenadine on the rocks. 4/5

Tropical Fruit Margarita:
Frozen fruit-flavored  margarita mix (strawberry,  raspberry, banana, wildberry or mango), Triple Sec, and tequila. I picked strawberry and banana. I got mine served in a souvenir blender cup. This was surprisingly nice and strong. 4/5

Feelin' Hot Hot Hot:
Tequila, agave nectar, Habanero lime, margarita mix, and jerk seasoning on the rocks. I couldn't taste the habanero or whatever spice. 1/5

Cuban Sandwich:
Pulled pork, ham, Swiss cheese in a Cuban loaf with mustard. Served with a side of fries. I've had good Cuban sandwiches before. This was just ok. The bread was think and crispy. But I should have gotten the fish sandwich instead. 3/5

Barbecue Bacon Cheeseburger:
Nothing to write home about. 3/5

Our server was quite good. But man, that bartender."}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant only. We came here a couple of days ago and were very disappointed, especially for the price. Half the place is under construction so you can't eat and watch people walking on the strip. Everything was way overpriced. For the same prices you could eat at a much nicer place on the strip. I food was unimpressive. The nachos were really big but nothing to write home about taste-wise. Burgers and soup were just ok and again, overpriced. We will not be coming back to this place. Save your money and go somewhere that is worth the cost."}
{"text":"No qualms with this fun restaurant! Great food. Great service. Cheeseburger in paradise is always a winner. The chicken nachos are also a family favorite. I have yet to try all of the drinks but they sound great and everyone I'm with enjoys them. I did try one off of their summer menu and it wasn't that great but that could just be a personal preference. The waiter knew I didn't like it so he took it off our bill. How nice! And now they have breakfast! I got the French toast. It was soooo good! It's always a reliable place to go if you're on the strip."}
{"text":"Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A Margaritaville close to home! I am a local and have  been to 8 Margaritavilles (Key West, Las Vegas, Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, Orlando, Grand Cayman, Cozumel,Glendale)! Yes, I am a long time parrothead and love Jimmy Buffett-his music, the parrothead lifestyle, and of course, margaritas!. This location doesn't have slides that empty into a pool or water, nor do they  have trampolines in the ocean to bounce on, but is sits right off the Westgate dancing fountains, so there is water around! Margaritaville Glendale is in the Westgate Center which is in the Cardinal Stadium complex (hate the name University of Phoenix Stadium). You can sit inside or outside. The food is wonderful-The Volcano Nachos are towering feasts of wonder and are made for more than one person to eat! The Jamaica Mistaika wings are sweet yet spicy, and the Corn and Crab Chowder soup is delightfully good! The Margaritas get my 10 lime seal of approval!! I have yet to ever have a bad margarita at any of the locations and it's nice to know that you can order a drink and expect excellence, time and time again! The ceiling depicts The Arizona Beach (you know after California drifts away from the mainland). I have to limit my review to 4 stars as when we were there on opening day and having a great look around at the nuances of this locale, the manager was a bit uptight about it, and it put a bit of a downer on the 1st visit. The waitstaff are wonderful as are the Smuggler's hold staff, especially Shay!  There really isn't a trademark \"thing\" like a blender that gets dived into, or an exploding volcano. That would have been nice!
-----------
Update August 2009. -We've been back more than once but I wanted to give Margaritaville KUDOS for outstanding customer service. I have now upgraded my review to 5 stars. Never let it be said that one person can not represent an entire chain of restaurants in one fell swoop. We went for lunch August  27th and ordered conch fritters for appetizers. We both had frozen Desdemona Raspberry Ritas as well. I then ordered a lunch size Chicken Caesar Salad, and my daughter ordered Bayou Shrimp Pasta. Upon it's arrival, my salad looked and tasted divine.My daughter didn't realize the pasta dish had sausage in it, and was looking at it making a funny face. I had just asked her what was wrong when our waitress appeared. She could also see my daughter sort of picking at the dish. My dtr. asked if there was sausage in it and the waitress said yes. This waitress ( I believe her name was Heather) immediately, and I mean IMMEDIATELY offered to take it back and get her something else.She said we wouldn't be charged for it at all, and she'd be glad to get her something she could eat. It was her immediate willingness to resolve this matter that made me ask her to go ahead and put it in a to go box and I would take it home to my hubby. She asked \"Are you sure 'cause it is no problem to just switch them out\". I assured her that it would be fine, and my dtr. ordered another shrimp dish which was wonderful! In this day and age, having someone so willing to make something right is refreshing!! I am hoping that Margaritaville sees this and recognizes the young lady for her outstanding customer service!!! The frozen raspberry ritas got 10 out of 10 limes for being frozen concoctions of pure delight!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my husband and I ventured in here after turning down the 35 minute wait at The Yardhouse. Margaritaville was nearly empty.. It's a HUGE restaurant with a lower and upper level, and on a Saturday night I would expect it to be packed. Not so, there were maybe five tables in use. It all started out well enough. The place is visually entertaining. They've clearly spent a small fortune on the island-type decor and primo space viewing the fountains at Westgate. 

That's where the good ended. 

I was desperate for a steak after forgoing Yardhouse, so I was happy when I saw a basic sirloin on the menu. There were two \"turf\" options, and I opted for the non-teriyaki version. At $21 and some change I was hoping for a fairly decent steak, rare. (I clarified to our server twice just to make sure) 

My husband ordered a simple Cuban sandwich. 

The food took strangely long to come out, seeing how there was nearly no one there. When it finally did come out it was presented in an ok fashion. Although my $21 sirloin was a mere deck of cards size and suspiciously dark. I cut into the center of the steak to find a ragingly overcooked piece of meat. Annoyed, I began on my Caesar salad and fries which were incredibly ordinary but edible. Read: frozen fried steak fries and generic Caesar) The server came back to ask us how everything was, and begrudgingly I presented her with my so overcooked it was dry steak. She apologized and was nice enough, then promised to have another one cooked immediately. 

10 minutes passes...

Husband has decided that his Cuban is really actually kind of crappy. The bread was stale and crushed, the ham, flavorless, all around it was just a really boring and terribly executed sandwich.

15 minutes passes....

25 minutes pass..

And finally the server returns. She says that when they were cooking my second steak \"they botched it\" and unfortunately they have no more steaks prepped for tonight. At this point I was full on crappy fries and my Caesar salad, and just said scrap it all. She tried to get me to order anything else.. I just wasn't having it. I wanted to go home and cook myself a steak. 

Eventually the manager came out, and he was also desperate to \"take care of us\" and very apologetic. He and the server both seemed sincere, but I just wanted nothing to do with the place any more. No, I didn't want a free meal next time. No, I don't want a free slice of cheesecake. No I don't want coconut shrimp. 

It was nearly comical after the groveling session had concluded. 

Our server brought us our bill, my food removed of course, we paid, and got the hell out of dodge. We will never return to this place. A junky sandwich, insane time lapses between ordering and receiving, and they run out of steaks on a Saturday night at 7:30 pm? Ridiculous. 

I'd advise anyone considering Margaritaville to go to any one of the other restaurants within Westgate. There's a ton of good ones, this one NOT being one of them."}
{"text":"I came here twice while I was in Vegas for an event.  Since it was right across the street from the hotel I was staying at, it was convenient.  Drinks were good, but could have been stronger.  I love fruity drinks but I didn't even leave with a buzz and usually I do after one drink.  The food took forever.  I mean like 40 minutes.  Some people from our table went to another bar to drink and when they came back, our food was still not there yet.  Our waiter never came back to check on us after he took our order.  We couldn't even get his attention.  He forgot a couple drink orders completely and messed up on one of our food orders.  It took an additional 10 more minutes to get that fixed.  

After our meal we had to wait awhile to find our waiter so we could pay.  When we finally did, he never came back to get the money.  Another 10 minutes go by and we had to stop him to come to our table.  Just glad gratuity wasn't already added since we had a group of 6.  

Horrible service and watered down drinks."}
{"text":"Jimmy Buffett creates an empire on a one hit wonder-Genius!  Parrot Head Heaven.
Went to Margaritaville with some friends on Friday night 8/30.   Food is mediocre.  Atmosphere is expected for this type of establishment.  We had the basic Margaritas on the rocks-a little pricey for mostly margarita mix.  
Had the combo fajitas-so, so.
Shared Volcano Nachos-nothing special.
If you want a party atmosphere with average food at high prices, this is the place.  For serious mexican food and margaritas, there are plenty of other places in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've spent a lot of time talking smack about this place, making fun of the people who hang over the railing calling out to the girls walking past, my ex bf who raves about this place and makes it a point to go here on every Vegas trip and making fun of Jimmy Buffett in general. That's right folks, no parrot head here! 

Well I eat my words. What started off as just grabbing a drink here as a joke and to tell my ex that I finally went to Margaritaville turned into a couple hours of good times. My friend and I were lucky enough to get seats at the bar near the open patio and service was superb. The bartender we had was so attentive and when he was busy the other bartenders would check on us. I forget what I had to drink there but I do know it was decent. Decent meaning that I could taste alcohol but not too much alochol and not a ton of mixer or juice. We only ordered an appetizer and I believe it was a crab or lobster dip. Um, can you say awesome?!? A woman next to us ordered the nachos and I was drooling just watching her eat them. Although I dont know how she ate them herself because those nachos are enough to feed 4 people. 

I can't wait to visit Margaritaville again and spend some more time there!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and right on the strip!

I came here for dinner on a Friday night and it was only a 10 minute wait.

The waiter was very friendly and very quick.

We ordered a guac and salsa with chips as an app - it was amazing.

I ordered the 'cheeseburger in paradise' and it was excellent. My wife had the fish tacos and those were amazing too.

The bill was very reasonable as well -- this place would be great for a family with kids; it has lots of music and other shenanigans (dunk tank, people making balloon animals, etc)."}
{"text":"Stopped by the outdoor bar so the wife could get a foo-foo drink while we were walking down the street. While I don't necessarily mind paying $10 for a drink in a small plastic cup, it better have some booze in it at that price; this one, according to my wife, did not pass mustard in that department."}
{"text":"Love this place, great service and atmosphere! Nachos feed about 4 people and make a great appetizer. Music is always good and the night life even better. That is if you are looking for a place with a very relaxed dress code.  Great place to just relax, have a drink and enjoy the music."}
{"text":"This best thing is a no hassle military discount. Especially on memorial day we really appreciated that. Be sure to join their loyalty club as you get a free appetizer. Wait staff is a little older then some chains, but everything came out great and really enjoyed the experience. There's semi outdoor seating for those who like you, but everything is air-conditioned and very cool inside. Clean restrooms."}
{"text":"I'm a lover of Burgers and is on the hunt for the best one. I had a burger with pineapple salsa on it and it was amazing!  It was my favorite meal on the stripe. And the best food in the area."}
{"text":"What a fun and awesome atmosphere was experienced at Margaritaville in Las Vegas! Our party's age ranged from 50 to 80, and although we all agreed the drinks were a little pricey, we also agreed that the salads, sandwiches, and baked chicken dishes were freshly made and delicious. The decor is cleverly made up of fishing boats and island life, and there were pirates on stilts and a little island girl swinging from a hook. We highly recommend this restaurant for it's fun atmosphere, delicious food, and great service!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here long waits and crowded table areas .food was great staff was okay the nachos were good and huge but mostly corn chips covered in semi melted cheese. Will not come back. First time eating here prices are high to me not worth it. Bathrooms were far and gross!"}
{"text":"I stop here every time I come to Vegas.  I am not a big drinker, but this is the place where I always enjoy a strawberry margarita.  Service has always been great.  I appreciate the fact that year-after-year some of the same people I recognize and are still working here.  I like the ambiance of this place and the chill and relaxed atmosphere, plus, you can't go wrong with the music selection.  I will be back next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this new establishment for the first time expecting a great experience.    Well the building is quite impressive and the interior very well done.  Jimmy Buffet on the TV's.   Nice.

It was a slow night there with lots of empty tables (a Wednesday).   We were waited on by a very nice and attentive young man who was always nearby and very helpful.   He tried everything he could to accommodate us.  We left him a pretty generous tip.   

My wife had a flavored Margarita and I had a traditional one.   My wife liked hers, but didn't think it was anything special.   My traditional one was Ok,  but I have had much better at local Mexican restaurants.

My wife ordered the \"fall off the bone fork tender\" ribs and I ordered the catch of the day - Grouper which was fried.  I had the choice of it being prepared Cajun or grilled, but chose the fried.   We also ordered the Volcano Nachos which were very good and the portion HUGE.

Food came and the \"fall off the bone fork tender\" ribs were a little tough.   My wife had a hard time cutting them off the bone with a knife.   The waiter noticed the hard time she was having and came over.   He apologized and offered to send them back and get her something else.   Since she decided she just couldn't eat them, she sent them back and ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken dish.
My Grouper was just Ok.    A little over done.   It came with green beans which were kind of dry and tough, and rice. The rice was the best part of the meal.
The chicken meal came for my wife.  It looked more like some large chicken fingers.   She said it was ok, since she didn't want to give the waiter any more grief.   She ate one of the strips and had the others packed up to take home.   She told me when we got out that they were very tough and rubbery.   I tried to eat them for lunch the next day and she was right,  they had a very rubbery texture.   Hard to cut and even harder to chew. I threw them out.

We really wanted to like this place due the theme and atmosphere,  but will definitely not be going back.   Three drinks, two meals and tip were about $105.  We ate in a small bar in Willoughby two nights later and had a much better meal for about 1/3 the price.

Not sure if its the fault of the food they are buying or the chef, but they definitely need to improve the quality of the food they are serving or they will not survive."}
{"text":"A disappointment for sure.  No sweet tea - I mean, I was pretty sure ol' Jimmy was a Southerner at one point.  And the music was a mix of a little JB and then some pop music that I didn't recognize and some other stuff I didn't know either.  

Staffing was light as it was New Year's Eve so it took about eight minutes for our server to come over and get our drink order.  Jared was completely personable and a nice guy.  

It was mid-afternoon so we chose to split an order of the Volcano nachos.  It seemed like a huge portion, except after we ate the top layer of nachos, it was all just plain chips.  I think this may be a vegetarian option as there didn't seem to be any meat involved with the chili that was on it.  

Also, The Dog ordered 5 o'clock somewhere cocktail.  Tasty enough but the first one didn't come with the pineapple garnish but it did have a bit of orange and a cherry.  The second one didn't come with any garnish at all until we asked.  Then it was the orange, not pineapple as pictured.  When we asked about that, Jared went and retrieved some pineapple slices in a cup.  And it was all served in a plastic cup, for God's sakes, though the menu shows it in a nice tall glass.  Disappointing.

We did not want to try the \"homemade\" key lime pie so we got our check and left."}
{"text":"This is a loud full of energy place with a girl in bikini sliding down a water slide into a tank of \"booze\" every so often. And people on stilts making balloon hats & animals. 

Our waitress was attentive and friendly. The cocktails were delicious and really had booze in them. A rare treat for theme restaurants. We recommend the Zombie!

Food was DELICIOUS! We shared the Lava lava shrimp - scrumptious! And the Asagio  Crap dip and the Chicken Cobb Salad. Everything was delicious, hot, fresh and worth every penny! Great, fun place!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The hostess told us the wait would be 10-15 minutes and we waited for 30-45 minutes. There was 10 tables open so I asked the hostess why they were not using them and she replied very rudely. The band was so loud we could not talk to each other and the automatic 10% tip for the band was waist because the band was not that good. The surver was very cool but the nothing can make up for the hostess treating me like garbage. The food was ok but I would no come back here even if it was the last restaurant on earth."}
{"text":"I love sitting on the Patio, Sipping a Margarita, eating one of the best cheesebugers ever, listening to Jimmy and watching the masses of people on The Strip!  This is not a place to go if you are in a hurry or on a schedule.  This is a place to go to enjoy your time, have a few(or more) drinks and remember: \"It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere!\""}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad for a chain restaurant, never been to one of these, wouldn't go back, but it served its purpose in Vegas.  One of those places you go when you fly in and don't get into your hotel until after midnight and don't know your way around the Strip.  We stayed on the strip at Bally's and this place was in the Flamingo.  I'm not a Buffet fan,m so it didn't have my appeal but my lady said they had good margaritas and they did.  WE both had burgers and gotta say, pretty good.  This place was pretty loud and raucous, felt kinda like being at a frat party down south in Tennessee with a cover band cranking out today's biggest hits.  Our tab came to about 52 bucks for two burgers and two drinks total.  The service was surprisingly good for being as loud and crowed and crazy as it was."}
{"text":"Seating at late evening was poorly done as no hastiest was there to seat you.  We were told sit where you want;  after 10 min, the waiter for that area said he was getting off and we needed to move.  Pricy for what you get, will look elsewhere next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"5 stars for service, 3 stars for food. I went here for lunch on a Saturday. No wait but the place was pretty busy. The server (Mike) was AMAZING. He was so polite, friendly and very accommodating to my high maintenance family (sorry). He went above and beyond in every way. Total sweetheart. 

Now on to food. I got their take on shrimp and grits. Not the best. It was really heavy but okay. My enjoyed their food too. 

Not sure I'll be back just because the atmosphere was odd (touristy but family oriented). As a 20-something living downtown, this place just isn't my vibe. But I recommend others go! Especially families during the day. It's a great venue."}
{"text":"This used to be a place that I once enjoyed.Came here last year ,and the food and service was awful
Decided to give this place one last try,and and a total disappointment!!!!!
THEY NEED TO GO BACK 5 YEARS AGO WHEN THE MENU AND SERVICE WAS GREAT!!
Does Jimmy Buffet know that this place still exist???He must have sold it
Don't waste your time,and money!!!
The service is aweful,the food is gross!!!!!"}
{"text":"Margaritaville was actually pretty good. We got a lot of appetizers - the wings are insanely tasty. We also bought the 100 Oz. margarita mix for $50. *TIP* If you get it, tell them to put LESS ice. They put so much that it dilutes your drink quickly.

The shrimp/steak was very dry. I highly recommend that you don't order it and stick to nachos + burgers. 

One thing that's great about Margaritaville are the balloon makers. They make awesome balloon designs for your party/kids - an awesome experience. They have a show where a girl slides down the volcano - it's rather dumb, but better than nothing I guess."}
{"text":"Yeah, no. I don't know if they were just having a off night or what, but we had horrible service. It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 to get our appetizer. The nachos were good, but my entree was less than desirable and completely over priced."}
{"text":"Good service. Nice atmosphere but pretty bad food. I would only maybe go back for drinks if that."}
{"text":"When a night in Vegas goes wrong, there's always Margaritaville for dependable, hilarious fun.

While I've only eaten here late-ish and usually partially intoxicated, the food has always been delicious. My favorite by far is always the nachos; piled high with cheese and toppins', it's the perfect late-night snack. I vaguely remember having a burger at one point and it was delicious as well.

The staff has a great sense of humor; the first time I came here, my friend spent most of the night dancing with a feather duster and sat with it perched on his lap. Our waitress didn't miss a beat, asking him what he wanted to drink and if his \"date\" would like any libations. Drinks are a little small IMHO, but usually I can ask for a \"heavier\" pour and I have no problem being happily tipsy within 2-3.

Music is loud and a nice break from the club scene in Vegas. Crowd is a mix of ages, which I actually enjoy, because you get to see every type of person from different generations dancing along to the live band. Crowd is super laid back and much more relaxed than a lot of places in Vegas. Never has a pretentious vibe, and I've been here in full clubbing attire down to a tank top and shorts; all times have been unique but so fun. Love to dance all night long.

Between my college years exploring Vegas for the first time, to my current monthly visits for foodie dinners and days by the pool, I've had a fantastic experience every single time I've been here. While my normal ratchetry now includes less items \"borrowed\" off of maids carts, every time has been a pleasure, telling me it's not an accident this place is still so popular. 

Don't be fooled by the tourist-trap-y vibe you might get from Margaritaville - it's fully worth/necessary to make a stop here. Will be back in short order for more nachos & dancing!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.

Plastered from imbibing numerous Skyy dirty martinis, I allowed my companions to guide me into this raucous joint for some live music and volcano nachos. Immediately, the talentless drummer began grating on my nerves, and I reluctantly took a chair, feeling a touch claustrophobic due to the slung ceilings and thinking that there is nothing sadder than a group of desperate people trying really hard to party to the sounds of an atrocious band. As a piercing buzzer triggered a series of flashing lights, a lithe dancer suddenly shot from the volcano in the middle of the tacky restaurant and flowed like lava down the structure, finally splashing into a large margarita blender filled with neon liquid. As the band then broke out into a Journey medley, I gnashed my teeth, shoved several nacho chips in my mouth (which were nicely coated with beans and cheese), and ordered a couple of tequila shots from our willing server. Mollified by the seductive heat of the liquor, I finally roused my companions from their seats and headed back to the Strip. Never again, Margaritaville."}
{"text":"Why do I go here? I guess it's showy and kinda convenient so it works. Came here close to 4PM on a Thursday. I checked in on Yelp and got a BOGO margarita. We ordered nachos and a quesadilla to share between the 4 of us and drinks. 
Margaritas were strongggg...just the way they should be. Food was typical and nothing special...hard to mess up too LOL. 
Service was slow and left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Our group seemed to flock to this place.  One night we had the entire upper deck to ourselves for a party with a private band, which was pretty cool, the other nights we mixed in with everyone else downstairs (and danced to another band) the band was good, there were pleanty of places to sit - which was also nice, but it's just Margaritaville really.  Very touristy, and not exactly my type of place.

There was food at the private party, but I didn't try any of it - looked good tho."}
{"text":"Have you seen the show? It's really random and a little hokey, but in Margaritaville it's a little bit awesome too. The margarita flavors are fruity and sweet, and they come in plastic \"to go\" cups for walking around. I liked it here. The music is cheesy, but you expect that, so it's fun, and you've been drinking margaritas so you sing along with your arm around your friend and your drink in your other hand swaying above your head in line with the music. God bless Jimmy Buffet."}
{"text":"Great drinks and atmosphere.  But the management needs to get some better employees or monitor the service.   That aspect is soso.  Management fails"}
{"text":"Fine dining? No. Good service and decent food? Absolutely. 

As a Buffet fan, I like the theme and ambiance at Margaritaville. It's just a fun place to have some drinks, listen to some tunes and grab some food if you're so inclined.

Stopped by with some co-workers for a no-fuss, easy dinner at CES this week and Margaritaville hit the right marks.

Our server was really friendly and fast, also quick to fix a miscommunication regarding a side Caesar side salad.

Drinks were cold and plentiful and my Cheeseburger in Paradise hit the spot."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to hang out and grab a bite to eat with some friends. I had the jambalaya, it was very good. Also the volcano nachos were great. Just watch out, the portions are large."}
{"text":"Never been to this place, never heard of it. Head of Margaritaville thanks to Jimmy Buffet but I never knew there was a restaurant until I came to Las Vegas. We started off with drinks; I got my wife a \"Perfect Margarita\" which was very strong on the liquor and the price. Yet, if you can get buzzed off of just one drink than you paid mostly for liquor so I would call it an even trade. I had a Bahama Mama that was fair to midland, I could have done without the drink. I didn't have a lot of hope for the food just by looking at the menu. I ended up ordering the Jambalaya which did not look like Jambalaya that I have seen in photos but it did taste good and I ended up taking the other half home with me to eat later. Since we had a group of 6 we decided to have some chips and salsa (which in my experience you don't get charged for) and they ended up charging it for us so me and my wife along with our drinks spent about $70 together for lunch. I ate for much cheaper in Vegas at other locations. I would not say this place was bad, it is what it is but if I want to get a better deal I will look around if I can."}
{"text":"Albeit it would be nice to get wasted away in Margaritaville. Being early in the morning it wouldn't cut it for me so just steak and eggs with orange juice it is.  I've been craving steak and eggs so I wanted to eat somewhere where it wouldn't break the bank. Margaritaville ticked the box for affordable steak and eggs on the strip for only $25. It was only a 7 minute walk from my hotel l, Caesar's Palace. 

It's connected right into the Flamingo hotel. So you don't have to walk on the sidewalk from the Flamingo rather just walk through the casino towards the gift shop and into the main restaurant. 

No wait! 

I went straight for the bar and ordered what I wanted. There's nothing great about the food here other than enjoying the Margaritaville  ambiance. The bartender was quick to take my order and it only took 15 minutes for my food to arrive. 

Luckily I was able to charge it to the room and earn some Tier credits. For sure, next time I want to try the Volcano Nachos on the upper deck of the restaurant with a 5 O' Clock somewhere cocktail. Mmmm....."}
{"text":"Come for the drinks but don't stay for the food. Overpriced and just okay. But the drinks are delicious and makes this place my first stop in Vegas every time."}
{"text":"The margaritas were awful!! Tasted like all sugar and no alcohol. They charged $11 for essentially a non alcoholic margarita. They had like 4 dinner items on their menu so don't come here trying to eat dinner. Server was rude when we asked if they could add more alcohol since it was to sugary to even drink. They get 1 star because there was live music."}
{"text":"We went there on the fourth of July it was very crowded but that was expected. I did not eat there just had a couple beers. We went to the roof top deck and it was ok. I feel my overall take on the place was it has a very commercial feel to it. It has a gift shop and tee shirt area and had a Dave and buster type feel to it. I personally wouldn't have much desire to go back but still worth checking out"}
{"text":"Great place to come for a gluten free meal on the strip. Full gluten free menu with really good choices. Doesn't feel like you're missing out on a thing! Not to mention the frozen lime margaritas are awesome. Our server was cheerful, attentive and very aware of gluten allergies. She even gave me tips on other gluten free locations in the area. And the manager stopped by to check in with me since I had an allergy. Very good experience."}
{"text":"Went there for an early lunch.  The drinks were good but the food sucked.  Our fajitas were cold, the nachos only had cheese in them and the \"cheeseburger in paradise\" was no paradise.   Our waitress was very nice but if I are in Vegas I suggest guy fieri's instead."}
{"text":"(Disclaimer: I was dragged here by a friend and I think Jimmy Buffet SUCKS.)

The atmosphere was decent. The server was a pretty cool guy -- talkative and fun. The food was a bit mediocre -- the volcano nachos really hit the spot with that huge margarita tower thing they got, but afterward I felt pretty bad, like I was gonna hurl, though I managed to recover. Unfortunately one of my friends had to go back to her hotel right afterward and go on a date with bathroom =\

We had a booth with some lame TV playing some sort of lame stuff. I would've liked it better without the TV.

For what we got (nachos and a tower of margarita), it was kind of expensive."}
{"text":"Wow!
If you are a Parrothead such as myself, you will love the way they have the place decorated. And you will understand what some of the dongs and other artifacts stand for. It was like going home...to Margaritville. The food isn't give-star cuisine. Just good decent selection of a Parrotheads favorites.
Stop by and enjoy the adventure."}
{"text":"Happy Birthday and Happy Drunk Night to you sissy. It's Cinco De Mayo and the line at Margaritaville had stretched down the cave and out the door. Was it worth it? 

Heck yes.

Volcano nachos, blender margaritas(yaaaaaas, a whole pitcher to your greedy self), small strawberry margarita and plates of bison burgers. I'm in heaven. With cellphone in hand and friends to talk to, the wait hadn't seemed that bad. We were seated in a fishing boat booth, and though kind of stuffy at first, grew onto you. Specials had $5 shots with $7 margueritas. Loveeeeely.

Our plate of nachos arrived and it was a steaming pile of orgasmic carbs. Serving size was good for 5 people, if not more, and we scraped every last remaining piece of cheese. So worth the calories. What I enjoyed the most wasn't just the cool shows happening every 30 minutes, or the crazy people in stilts walking around making balloon animals, it was that their margueritas were so well blended you tasted how strong the alcohols were, but didn't choke on them. Amen!

Our server was an absolute doll, and we loved her. Customer service gets an A+ from me! Was such a tourist kinda night, but we loved it. I wouldn't choose to come on a non-occasion type of night, but it's a nice treat.

Pictures were taken, balloon hat was made, check paid and tip dropped--off we went."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something besides an overpriced tourist-trap, don't go here.  That said, if you embrace the concept, you will not be disappointed.  Food was fine, service good and atmosphere excellent.  It is what it is and it does it well.

We visited on a rainy late Saturday morning and the place was empty.  Having walked past the Strip-facing balconies on many a hot Vegas afternoon, I have no doubt that the place goes off under the right conditions.  

And by \"goes off,\" I mean fills with midwestern 30 and 40 somethings livin' on sponge cake and watchin' the sun bake (see, . . . cuz. . .) while hopped up on sugary-likkery-goodness.  And that's ok."}
{"text":"Place has gone to shit! Heard they are under new ownership (outside the us). Missing the upper deck restaurant, as are many people! While drinks are still good, the food has gone to less than par bar food. I always look forward to my perfect and volcano nachos when I visit. Well, the nachos are now horrible.
Shit needs to go back as it was!"}
{"text":"I eat at margaritaville every time I go to Vegas and it never disappoints! The he service is great and I definitely enjoy their margaritas and atmosphere. I like getting their one to blame margarita the best. I tried the watermelon margarita on the rocks this time and it was a little too sweet for my preference. Their crab dip is a yummy appetizer! I had the beach tacos as an entree and enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Avoid! Avoid! Avoid! Unless you like overpriced bland breakfast for $18 stay away and go somewhere nice! Check yelp before eating anywhere in Nevada! Coffee is shit and the rancheros is fucking slop! AVOID!"}
{"text":"Great food! Just the right portions not over the top. They serve coke so that's a plus right there. I had the crab and shrimp omelette with egg white, hash browns and English muffin. Wife had the pancakes, hash and bacon. All very good server was quick and friendly and it was a great experience 

We've came here and eaten multiple times across all our visits and never had a bad experience. Usually only eat the breakfast here though as they are many other places in Vegas go try for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"5 stars for the spicy buffalo wings but margaritas were below standard , didn't like the fact they serve drinks in plastic cups . Service was ok . Ordered one more appetizer shrimp in garlic sauce in pan , it tasted pretty decent too . Will definitely visit for wings again but not margaritas."}
{"text":"Had to stop here at least once. My favorite spot on the strip. The volcano nachos are the business. Coco cabana drink is amazing. My advice is stop here at least once!!! Btw I'm a big Buffett fan so that's why I enjoy this place so muc"}
{"text":"Went in off season, poor service, cold food, pricey for what you get. Ordered the taco salad - stale tortillas."}
{"text":"I went here almost every Thursday for 10 cent wing night. 10 cents! And they have Taco Tuesdays or something where each taco is 25 cents. It's ridiculously cheap and the drinks are relatively cheap as well. Cheap cheap cheap. 

What I like about this place is how the owners frankly don't care about anything. Nothing tips their hat  to the Jimmy Buffet tune or vibe except for a parrot high up in the corner of the bar and the often-broken margarita machines at the back of the bar. Everything is as grey and brown as the Pittsburgh winter. A chopper rider and his lady love are always smoking and cackling their nicotine laughter when I walk in, and if you come in before 8, the crabby bartender awaits you. Good memories.
Another perk is the convenience to the Birmingham bridge and I also seem to find parking nearby, which is always nice.

(*I don't understand how there are pictures for not-yet-reviewed restaurants. So mysterious...)"}
{"text":"Ohhhh Margaritaville, how I adore your carefree camaraderie. If only life were as simple as it is on one of your barstools! This has always been one of my favorite places to wile away an afternoon in Vegas, sipping on Bama Breezes and chatting with fellow imbibers.

Given my lifelong obsession with Jimmy Buffet, Margaritaville is my home away from home. The drinks are DELICIOUS (although I wish they had larger sizes for some of the yummy specialty frozen drinks -- and a little more liquor in them), and the food is good (not fabulous, but good).
 
I made several stops here on this particular trip - for drinkies and food, and it didn't disappointed. You also get little shows here, so there's a lot of entertainment value.

I love you Margaritaville - lord knows I'm helping to line Mr. Buffett's pockets with my frequent patronage. :)"}
{"text":"I was drug to the strip to go out for a dinner with some out of towners.. They insisted we go to Margaritaville because of Mr. Buffett himself.. I tried my hardest to convince them that he will not be sitting on the back of one of the boats with Allan Jackson belting out a tune. Apparently they did not think my opinion was right..haha. 

Needless to say we ended up standing out front with our little buzzer waiting for about 40 minutes, I expected the wait so that was no big deal, also for some reason it had to be one of the best days for people watching on the strip. The grown man wearing a tube top and a pirate patch was one of the most amusing things I saw out there. 

Anyways, I know I know, get on with it Raymond... I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich which was pretty good for being served at one of the strips many themed restaurants.. The other items brought to our table: Volcano nachos, and a fajita concoction, everything looked great and smelled great and the atmosphere was okay.  It was a little odd when the attractive young lady on stilts walked over to our table and bent down in my face to ask if i wanted an awesome Balloon hat made by the best looking girl on stilts in town.... Uhhhhhh, 
\"AWKWARD\".   They try really hard to make the atmosphere 
party-esque which they do a pretty good job of. My only complaint is that in the hour and a half that we spent there I think I heard the same songs over and over and over again.

I guess I can say that this is cool to check out once... The food was decent, not the best I've had and the drinks only had a splash of alcohol and were over priced.    I don't see myself going back but feel free to sail away in the back of a fishing boat mounted to a wall while the Benjamins fly out of you wallet.."}
{"text":"Having been to many Margaritaville's in my lifetime, I knew that walking into the Las Vegas one would not disappoint. We ordered a margarita sampler which was AMAZING. It had been a while since we had tequila, much less margaritas so it definitely brought back some memories. They had several little shows going on while we were there including stilt walkers, hula girls and fun dancers. This would be a great place to take a group!"}
{"text":"We stopped here while walking the strip for an early lunch (11:30amish) as family on trip had been before and wanted to try again. This place probably was in its heyday back in the 80's, but it could use about 50 gallons of botox treatment if you catch my drift. 

The service was slow and far from friendly. I would guestimate that 50% of the food served wasn't eaten by the 8 people at the table - you be the judge.and let it be known that you were forewarned!"}
{"text":"Over hyped and underwhelming

I love that it seems I'm boarding a ship but all the decoration and famous name backing can't bring tasty food or much needed crowds here.

We stopped in for Happy Hour and left less than thrilled. Only one beer made the Happy Hour list -  Fin lager. Let's talk Happy Hour food - the only decent sounding item is the Volcano Nachos which are not included. Why not? Everything is still over priced during Happy Hour when every app is 50% off. 

So, we ordered the Lump Crab, Shrimp, and Mushroom Dip with Garlic Toast. It was awful! The garlic bread was inedible because it was soaked in oil/butter. We asked the bartender to bring us chips instead since it was terrible. She said she'd have to charge us for them!!!!! The dip was missing the lump crab but not the fishy taste. The shrimp and mushrooms were lacking as well. The dip got runny and didn't have the Cajun kick one might expect. 

Overall, this  place wastes away in Westgate except possibly on game nights. Enjoy a sugar loaded tiny fruity drink if you want, but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"After writing my review I received this so called concerned remark on my post that appears to come from Nikki H. of Margaritaville, so I did contact her but behold I still have NOT revived anything back. I  think it was just put on the site to make it seem like they were concerned to the readers, in fact after googling her, I found she does it to everyone on yelp that comments badly of their restaurant around the county so she is not a Business owner to a specific site , Makes no difference if you live in Cleveland or Las Vegas its the same ! Another reason why NOT to GO to Margaritaville ! Management seems to lead tot he bad that happens in the restaurants.

DON'T WASTE your good money and time going to this place !

---------------------------------------------------
Food ridiculous overpriced for garbage quick food. Atmosphere OK. Don't waste good money going here or your time just a TOTAL waste !!!ff

Barfff!

Oh and there great Margaritas are nothing at all I've had MUCH MUCH better margaritas every where else !"}
{"text":"Play the amazing drinking game we invented. Hang out on the balcony outside the lower bar and take a shot anytime someone runs into the fire hydrant on the sidewalk! And the crab shrimp dip is great!"}
{"text":"When I got there I thought....Great this is one of those over decorated restaurants with bad food but..............I was wrong. I had the Volcano Nachos  which were BOMB!!!! I got the steak on top me and my hubby barely put a dent in them  that's how big they were  and the WILD BERRY PINA COLADA is to die for!!!!!!! A must have. My husband had the Cuban pork Sandwich and he was very happy with it. There is seating on the 3rd floor patio with misters but.....When it's \"slow\" the patio area is closed!!! Which I thought was a huge BURRRRRR!!!!  When is a business ever slow in Vegas on a Saturday at that. Other then that.......The service is great, fast and not expensive at all the Volcano Nachos are about $14.00 but can serve up to 3-4 people.

***it's a must go to spot when in VEGAS!!!!!!!!***"}
{"text":"Went for a friends Birthday on 8/27/2017. Got there at 3 PM and were told its a one hour wait to be seated. Decided to stand near the outside bar and get a few drinks. First of all the drinks are rather pricey for what you get. $10 margaritas are fine but it was mostly sour mix and not very large. The crab dip was pretty good. Finally got to sit inside. The place is large inside and room for more tables. Why not place more tables there and reduce the hour long waits? It wasn't even that busy for a 1 hour wait. More tables! We place our order and after about 45 minutes to meals come out. I ordered the jambalaya. It was a small portion and the rice was cold. My friends also complained. We didn't ask for doggie bags for the ones who couldn't finish (I didn't finish because I wasn't hungry after the first few bites) 

After the meal the tally for my GF and myself was $150! For that $$ we could have had a great meal on East 4th or Tremont!"}
{"text":"Had to worst mixed drink here ever....perhaps it has to do with one of their drinks including 151!  Not the best choice.  Large joint with tacky decor, but hey, this IS Vegas."}
{"text":"My family and I came in during the annual arts fest. We knew it would be super busy, as they told us our wait would be three hours. BUT we only ended up waiting one hour. YAY! 

The atmosphere was AMAZING! We've been the the Florida Keys location several times, and this one is much more fun! So spacious, so tropical, rooftop bar, live music, just so fun !!!

Food came quickly and everyone loved it.
I got a veggie burger and it didn't look like a veggie burger I've ever had before, but they assured me it was. They also have gluten free buns available! 

It's $$$ but I think it's worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"I always have a good time when I come here. Kala and Jimmy are awesome bartenders. They remember us even if we haven't been there for 6 months, and are always concocting experimental drinks for us to taste! (Experimental=lots of alcohol) If you're not chilling at the bar, stand by the rail that overlooks the Strip and watch the freak show roll by. I've never really eaten here, so I can only comment on the drinks. Havanas & Bananas is probably my fave off the menu. I always leave this place wastin' away again in Margaritaville!!"}
{"text":"Huge Jimmy Bufffet fan so just the ambiance was really fun from the hanging airplane to the huge blender, tables in boats and Jimmy on the big screens in concert, But if you've been to one in another state they are all the same but still fun

The food was really good I've had several items but had the ranch burger at this location and it was really good.

However the watermelon margarita stole the show!! Very good and very strong 
When I pay $10/drink which is the case everywhere in Vegas I expect them to be strong 
Margaritaville did not disappoint"}
{"text":"Eeeh. I didn't love it. Neither did my boyfriend. Didn't hate it, either...but I doubt I'd ever choose to go back, even with the worst hangover and even if my tastebuds all fell off. The food was not that good and the drinks were on the edge of being terrible. I used to bartend and I was very unimpressed with what was served to me. Plus, for the money we spent, we could have eaten somewhere far better! Perhaps if you're obsessed with Jimmy Buffett, this would be a great place for you. It's just not my fave!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch one day last week while in Las Vegas. It was 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon and was extremely busy and we had a 45 minute wait.

My husband had the seafood mac and cheese, which he loved. I had a hamburger with a side salad and onion rings which were also very good.

Jimmy Buffet concerts were played on the big screen, and the atmosphere was very festive, although being such a big restaurant, it was very noisy.

The prices were very reasonable for Las Vegas, so is a great place to go if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"We came by here after an unsuccessful trip to the club (thanks sexist assholes) but we still had a blast coming to Margaritaville, the piano bar after and then to end the night at the Rock Bar for a ho down!

earlier in the day we saw the massive nachos and decided to come back and that decision was made! 

four of us shared a nachos plate, cheese curds, and the fifth person ordered the seafood macaroni, I'm not sure how he liked it but he finished the plate!

the Cheese curds were delish, cheesy ooey gooey goodness! what was weird though it came with bbq sauce as well as marinara, but the bbq was an odd choice which ive never seen 
the Nachos were HUGE for $18 four of us could not even finish it! it was nothing \"phenomenal or unique, but it was full of cheese, sour cream, guac, jalapeños, salsa, beans, and more! 

to drink, i ordered the \"no one is to blame\" margarita blended, and hot damn this is one of the best margaritas i have ever had! and it damn well should have been at a \"Margaritaville\"! it was little sour a little sweet nice amount of alcohol and blended perfectly!

great spot to come by in Vegas"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Found a seat at the rooftop bar. Waited 20 minutes and wasn't even acknowledged. Decided to go downstairs and try one of the other bars. Same exact thing happened. No acknowledgement or service. This place is so cliche. Especially with all the tacky decor. The Flats happens to be an amazing part of Cleveland. Adding this franchise to this part of Cleveland is like adding a McDonalds. I have zero intentions of returning to this establishment. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Thank you Claire for the wonderful service. She went above and beyond and was so easy to talk to!"}
{"text":"Short version: long wait, mediocre food, good service, overly sweet margaritas, and a band that were so loud conversation was impossible.  If you're here for a bachelor party where you're happy to get drunk and scream yourself hoarse, then it's probably fine... but not my idea of a good dining experience."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Flamingo for my mom's 55th birthday so we decided to eat here for dinner. I called ahead earlier in the day to make an 8:15 reservation and mentioned the event we were celebrating. When we arrived there was no record of our reservation and we were told we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table. I showed the outgoing call on my phone to prove I had called ahead and I asked if there was anything they could do. After 10 minutes the hostess agreed to seat us and apologized for the confusion.  Okay fine.  We were seated and greeted by our server, Jennifer, who took our drink orders but did not bring them to us for 20 minutes- when she did she spilled some of them on my parents laps.  I get that these things happen but it just the combination of events just came off to us as sloppy.  I could see if it were super busy but surprisingly for a Saturday night it was not.  What we did observe instead was Jennifer chatting with her co-workers for several minutes at a time.  What's more, she did not take our order for another 10 minutes bringing our drinks despite letting her know we were ready.  I had hoped the food would be worth the wait to compensate for the subpar service but it was not.  The coconut shrimp breading was thick and undercooked and my green beans were cold but after waiting so long  I ate it anyway instead of sending it back.  I'm glad other people have had a great time here but I cannot say the same.  The best thing I had was my $32 pina colada in the blender souvenir cup."}
{"text":"My girlfriend's and I went to the \"5 o'clock Somewhere\"  bar on Cinco De Mayo 2016, the bartenders are fun and perform tricks while making drinks. The blended mango margarita was great, a little on the sweet side, yet exactly what you would expect. And tequila shots are only $11. This is definitely a bar I would revisit."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food, but the atmosphere is fun which must be the only reason why the place has this much business. Well that, and the fact that its at Westgate.

The service was as expected, friendly and attentive. 
The prices, even during Happy Hour, were fair to poor at best.
I had the wings which were not that great and tasted like they were frozen many times.
My wife had the seafood dip which was more like seafood soup with cheese melted over it. It comes with garlic bread that was also straight from the freezer. 
So to sum it up, if you want to be overcharged for food you could pull out of your own freezer, go here. 

I wont be back."}
{"text":"French fries, good. Veggie burger, horrible. I live in L.A. do we just know how to make a veggie burger and the rest of the country doesn't? Take it off the menu then! 

It's a decent looking place, apparently the highest grossing restaurant in the country from what I hear. Very loud, so if you want to come here to eat and then dance it's a decent spot. Just not to talk."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a meal while in Vegas. The theme and decor are fun. A must visit for any Jimmy Buffett fan! My mom and I split the fish and chips meal. Very tasty! It was a good portion and filled us up. The service was just ok."}
{"text":"I  was in town for a meeting and group of us was looking for a place we could all have dinner together. The servers at Margaritaville made it happen. They were super friendly and accommodating, especially considering they were dealing with a group of 15 people. The orders were taken and delivered  prompt and efficient manner without sacrificing friendliness or personality. The food was similar to other margaritaville restaurants I've been too. It was consistently ok. Not amazing, not terrible. Just ok. The drinks however, were wonderful."}
{"text":"This was one of our last stops on our trip to Vegas, and being that I love my Margarita's, we had to stop into Margaritaville.  

First of all if you have an aversion to loud music and lots of people, you might think to try another spot, because this place was hopping when we got there, so much so there was no seating, but that didn't stop us from waiting.

Definitively a place to go when you are in the mood to party and that my friends is a wrap. 

But stay tuned for an updated review, I just may try it again when I go back!"}
{"text":"A fun place, with okay food.  I'm not a Parrot-head or whatever, but I still had a good time.  Normally I'd say it's expensive, but considering it's Vegas I guess it was a pretty reasonable lunch (my wife and I ate lunch - hamburger and a club, had a couple of drinks) and it was about a $100.  If I had one down the street I'd probably never go, but since I was on vacation it was a pretty cool place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Being a country music fan, this is a place I felt like I needed to visit at one point in my life. I was a little underwhemled with the \"crowd\" [it was pretty dead] but it was a cold week night so I'll cut them a break. The band was pretty good, but didn't pull any people out onto the dance floor. My friend and I ordered some nachos...pretty freaking good. and huge! Enough to feed like 4 people! She had a drink but wasn't too fond of it. Bar tenders were nice. Hopefully next time I visit, it's much more exciting."}
{"text":"As basic burgers go, this place is the best. I ordered nothing but a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and it was the BEST BURGER I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE. The burger is cooked to order and extra juicy. The fries are grilled perfectly, and for a place as poppin' as Margaritaville, service was fast. 

Great location if you started your night out early and need a place to grub and hydrate before taking on the rest of your evening. Don't even get me started on the live band playing classic rock and Jimmy Buffet covers for most of the night. They were a great addition to the island feel."}
{"text":"If you go with the mindset that you're here for the rita's then you'll be okay! Sit at the bar. If you have more than 2 people with you there's enough of you to share one order of nachos. They are HUGE. Stick around to see the sacrificial water slide action. It's a good place to stop mid strip to refuel on booze and junk food."}
{"text":"We went twice  2x in a row ordered vegetarian burgers and sweet potato fries
they messed up the order both nights 
the first time they apologized"}
{"text":"We all know Jimmy Buffet, and we all are aware of his love for all things tropical. His restaurant on \"the strip\" in Vegas is pretty darn fun. It is very VERY large and ALWAYS booming with people. I really enjoyed the men on stilts walking around making creative things with balloons. The margaritas were great, but I only gave it 4 stars because the food was not phenomenal. It is one of the cheaper places to eat on the strip, which draws a crowd, but the food was so so. At night it turns in to a dance club, which I hear is pretty fun.

This is one to check out wile your visiting....if nothing else, get a balloon hat, cool off from the 100 degree heat or enjoy a margarita ;o)"}
{"text":"When I turned 21, my friends sadly left LA very late and didn't make it out to vgeas by midnight. Fortunately (or not, depends how you look at it) I had been in town for a few days prior with my family. They thought it would be a good idea to take me here at midnight to check it out. An hour later, both my parents had passed out and my brother and I were chatting over a bucket of beers. Older crowd, but decent drinks"}
{"text":"The Mr's Uncle comes to town 3-4 times a year and stays next door, every time he comes to town we meet here for dinner to catch up on what's going on.  Mrs gets the cobb salad or the pulled pork sandwich every time, nether will disappoint but the salad always sends us home with left overs.  The Mr enjoys their fish entrees and on occasion the nachos.  HOLY COW the Nacho's are ridiculously massive, there is no way any one person probably not two full grown starving men can finish these in one sitting!"}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone else says, there are just so many reasons to give this place 5 stars:

1) The super-friendly and attentive waiter, who always had the right drink suggestion when you just couldn't decide.

2) The Italian margarita, which tasted like mobsters and biscotti, except in yummy margarita form. One of the best (and most unique) margaritas I've ever had.

3) The cover band, playing all sorts of songs we could sing along to obnoxiously. Most notably, \"Livin' on a Prayer.\" And, of course, Jimmy Buffett tunes.

4) The totally insane patrons dancing along to said cover band. There were these 2 girls in particular, I was so proud of them. Dancing out there on the empty dance floor all alone, waving their arms and flouncing about. Eventually they got a bunch of people out there with them. Not Jess and I though, we were content to watch and be entertained.

5) The cheeseburgers -- Jimmy Buffett would be proud.

6) The patrons passed out in deck chairs out in the hallway.

Seriously, this is my new favorite bar. Ever. And there's a gift shop where you can get all your Jimmy Buffett gear! Score!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of word-of-mouth about this place, and decided to accompany my fiance and her friend for her friend's birthday celebration on a Saturday night.  Interesting that NO ONE seemed to be drinking Margaritas in a place called Margaritaville.  Security at the door is standard at a lot of Southside places, but clearly there is a need for it here..  I believe I actually interrupted a drug deal in the men's room.  It got more crowded as the night progressed, and overcrowded to the point where we felt unsafe.  I was afraid to let my fiance go to the restroom alone, and insisted they go together.  They ran out of glasses while we were there.  Mixed drinks in plastic cups are for frat parties, not a professional establishment.  Maybe it's better during the week, but no more Saturday nights at Margaritaville for me."}
{"text":"Terrible kitchen! The two people ordered chicken fajita meals and came out cold and with soggy Tortillas the one girl got literally two pieces of chicken!  The chicken that was on these plates was all gristle and the whole meal had absolutely no flavor. The bison burger was pathetic and had no sauce or lettuce and probably 10 fries. The burger was flatter than something you would find at McDonald's. Another girl ordered a burger with sweet potato fries and didn't even get her food until we complained (it came out with regular fries) the table had no silverware had to ask for that! Then waited on the silverware for 10 minutes. the drinks sucked for a place that is supposed to be \"famous\" for a margarita you think you could get one that is half way decent. They over priced and under poured!!!! Oh to top it off we probably waited for an hour and a half for the food with two kids and a pregnant woman. Jimmy buffet would not be proud."}
{"text":"Always a good time!  Since I was last here in April, it seems like maybe the menu has changed because I didn't previously notice that they had many vegetarian options.  This time around, they had several veg-friendly options and even had marked on the menu which items could be made vegetarian.  Kudos on that.  However, I had a chicken salad minus the chicken and was charged the same price... not a huge issue but surely the chicken would have been more costly than the lettuce, sugared pecans, and mango?  In any case, the food here is always good and I love the nautical ambiance.  Service was on par the Monday evening I visited and there was no wait for a table.  The outdoor dining space is excellent as well with a fun view of the strip.  My only issue with Margaritaville is that it is always freezing cold!  I almost always prefer to eat outside when possible since I won't be shivering throughout my meal!"}
{"text":"Come here every time we are in Vegas. Have spent Halloween here and New Year's Eve as well. Always a great time. Servers are great, food is good, music is fantastic. My kinda place."}
{"text":"Good drinks. Horrible service. Service super slow. Food sub-par and in need of seasoning. Service was not with a smile. One star is only for drinks. Appetizers didn't even taste well."}
{"text":"Gets three stars for the theme and the fact that the volcano show here in Vegas is well over the top of what I have seen in other locations. The food is pretty consistent from location to location -- the nachos are a huge starter and the fish tacos were good enough to make me happy. I really enjoyed the Blueberry Pomegranate Margarita!

On the down side it was the twilight zone at the check in desk. Not friendly at all. Also, the Flamingo itself (where the Margaritaville Casino and Restaurant are housed) needs a good implosion remodel when you compare it to nearly everything else in the immediate area."}
{"text":"There are two reasons why I love margaritaville and two only. 

The first reason: Redbull margaritas. This is like the ultimate cure for a hangover AND you get to maintain drunkness. Fuck yes. If you sit there long enough and drink enough of them, suddenly you'll find yourself running down Las Vegas Boulevard at full speed against traffic with your shirt off and not remember a damn thing. Good times.

Second reason: rare burgers. You know, I get fucking completely tired of places cooking their burgers all the way through if I specifically ask for rare. I assume the risk that I might get ecoli or mad cow when I eat rare meat. Needless to say I'm stoked that margaritaville will oblige me and give me my fucking rare burger. 

That's it. Just follow my lead and do it."}
{"text":"Service was good our waitress was very pleasant and made sure we had everything we needed. I got the crab and artichoke dip which was amazing and the seafood Mac and cheese which was awesome as well. The portions were very big and I could not finish the Mac and cheese which is good because I had leftovers!  

My friend ordered the chicken sandwich and it was just okay. He said it was dry."}
{"text":"Margaritaville is a must see and do if you are visiting Vegas. Our server was awesome and the food came very quickly. The Volcano Nachos definitely lived up to their hype. This is a dish that can be shared if you are in a group of 2-4 people. ITS HUGE. I'd also recommend the strawberry margarita, which is very good and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Cons:
- Expect a long wait, even if you have a small group.  (If you don't mind the bustle, sit at the bar instead.)
- People. Everywhere.
- Mediocre food.  Large portions, but nothing to write home (or Yelp) about.

Pros:
- The Perfect Margarita.  For this alone I'll go back to Margaritaville.   A must try for any tequila lovers.  Though, it's probably best if you don't drink this on an empty stomach.
- The gentleman that was sitting to my left also bought me a frozen License to Chill margarita, and that was also good, definitely lighter and fruitier.  But nothing compared to the Perfect Margarita.
- They have clowns.  On stilts.  Making balloon animals!   I really wanted one."}
{"text":"By far the best thing about this place is the decor, and the Jimmy Buffet name and brand.  This location is also in a prime spot- centrally located in the Westgate city center of Glendale.  We were seated at a weird \"end of the boat\" style table that was sort of like a low bartop.  The waiter tried to take our order by coming behind us.  Which doesn't make sense.  Just walk around to the other side so we don't have to turn around to see you.  That was weird.  Then our friends joined us so they moved us to another table.  I was excited to get a normal table.  Instead they sat us literally right next to the stage and warned us a band would be playing soon.  Not sure why we got the two worst tables in the place, since it was more than half empty.  The food was average and overpriced.  Service was average at best, painfully slow at the worst.  By far the worst thing about this place (oddly enough) was the actual margaritas! You would expect them to be really good with the name of the place, but they were awful.  Bitter and sour.  Also, they told us it was \"the biggest margarita ever\" and it was tiny.  I think this place is probably a better place to come just for a drink and hang out and not try their sit down dinner service."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fun and inviting. Was very busy when I went and was seated in 20 min. Great service, great energy. This place does NOT skimp on the drinks. Had one drink an was feelin it. Service was good but could be faster. That's why it gets 4 stars. But entertainment was fun and music keeps the restaurant together it feels like.good playlist. Will be back here!"}
{"text":"Mmm, you can almost taste the mediocrity!

Went here on Cinco de Mayo because we had to have margaritas and we were able to score a seat on the upper deck, which I thought was nice until they told us they couldn't put up the umbrellas due to wind so that we baked in the unrelenting Vegas sun.

Ordered overpriced margaritas in tiny plastic cups filled with ice as well as a shrimp appetizer that came with exactly 5 1/2 shrimp.

For my entrée, I ordered the shrimp trio which was about Red Lobster quality at twice the price ($25).  I did like the spicy sauce with the coconut shrimp, though.  

Service from the waitress was nice but they have a line to stand in if you want a table upstairs, only it's not marked and the lady who was seating people wouldn't tell people where to go, so people would come upstairs and then stand at the front of the line in front of people who had been waiting 20 minutes.  It was comical to watch.

I'm not the target demographic for this joint so take my review with a shaker of salt.  I equate Jimmy Buffet to the Ethan Hawke character in the film \"Reality Bites\" and regard each with disdain, so that may color my opinion."}
{"text":"Definitely touristy, lots of families, wait seems pretty much forever (or 45 minutes, whichever comes first). And yet the ambiance is great, the staff are friendly, the food is surprisingly good, and it isn't very expensive. Gotta get the Margies, of course - and I would recommend Jimmy's Jammin Jambalaya.

Plastic accepted, of course. Music would be better if they actually *finished* one of Buffet's songs."}
{"text":"Well, last week my Vegas bucket list contained the simple (yet somehow elusive, for me) task of going to JB's Margaritaville and having a margarita (I love margaritas and have had my share). I can half-way cross this off, but not really. 

After a long night, I was dying. Ya know, that \"Vegas-did-you-well\" kind of dying. But whatever, we had to power through. Our party of 6 was determined to go to M-ville, and that we did. On a Wednesday afternoon, we walked over from Cosmo and strolled into here from the sewer-smelling hell known as the Flamingo casino. We were seated right away, and seen right away. 

TIPPITY-TIP-TIP: Request Ryan L. as your waiter! Seriously, this guy is the only reason that I am giving ANY stars (the food was HORRIBLE, as I will get into a little later). Management, if you read this, please recognize Ryan. He was nothing short of fantastic! He would probably remember our table, we were probably his only entertainment for the day. 
Everyone at the table was going to get a margarita (except me, I cringed at the thought), and he recommended that by the time they all got the specialty margaritas, it would be about the same price as their \"Tower of Margaritas:\" a tap-operated, 5-foot tall tube loaded with ice and their traditional margarita that would serve everyone 2 margaritas...of course my friends opted for that. Not only this, but he brought out a few flavors when two of my friends didn't like the taste of the regular margarita. 

For food, we all know I needed food. Something. The only redemption was the fact that the corn soup I ordered was brought out right away. This dish just didn't taste that great, but I still knew I needed to eat it. So I did. 

However, when all the main dishes came out, I had just ordered the boneless buffalo wings. How hard is this? Really? These came out and it was like they had them frozen, but then the kitchen had them being cooked in the microwave for the entire duration since when Jimmy Buffet was born. I have never had more dry, tasteless, disgusting chicken in my entire life. I could barely chew it-- not to mention that they were room temperature. I ate about maybe 2-3 out of 12 and let the rest sit there. Absolutely pathetic. The rest of our party ended up with nachos-- a massive heap of tortilla chips with room temperature toppings that tasted old. Shame on you, Margaritaville. 

And, enter Ryan to the rescue (kind of). We didn't want to complain-- we had places to go-- but he craftily split everything at the table on the checks before we even asked; he split the massive margarita into 6, the nachos into 3, a last-minute pitcher of margz into 2, and another entree into 2 or 3. So easy. 

As miserable as I felt, I felt somewhat better towards the end (thank you, soup and water). So, I forced myself to have at least two drinks of the margarita. Unfortunately, I was once again not impressed. Sigh. 

Bottom Line: Three stars for service. Negative 1 for food. Gross."}
{"text":"The decor here is fun, an airplane hangs from the ceiling and there are I think sharks too.  We were seated in an area that was so dark you could barely see the person across from you.  The food here is okay, I had a carne asada taco and a carnitas taco. They were good but pretty basic.  Nothing much to them.  The drinks are okay too.  I had the mango margarita which was fine but again nothing much to it. The prices are fair,  not too expensive.  This is an overall okay place."}
{"text":"I just wanted to stay here all day. The atmosphere is so chill and relaxing!

Service: because it's just the \"soft\" opening still, the kitchen is slow and the bartender told us that most of them are working doubles and some people aren't showing up. That's totally unfortunate, but because of the great service and the chill atmosphere I'm not mad about waiting. 

Drinks: the drinks are great. Tried the regular margarita, the blueberry pomegranate margarita, the incommunicado, the tranquil waters-- when it comes to the drinks you can't go wrong. 

Food: the food looks pricey but portions are HUGE and delicious. The nachos could feed a family of 4 as an entree. The dinners are big and the food is yummy. 

If you're trying it out during the soft opening, just relax and kick back! They'll figure it out and it will continue to be amazing."}
{"text":"Margs on the Strip!!

We walked down the strip quite a way to get here, so it was nice to be seated right away. Our waiter, was friendly. 

We ordered drinks, a couple margs both on the rocks and blended. The drinks came out way quick than expected for our party of 5. Recommend the watermelon marg - so yummy.

This place has typical food. this can be a plus however, since there is probably something to please everyone in your party. I ordered a chicken bacon sandwich. I should have asked to add avocado -  would have made the sandwich. All the other food we got, ( cheeseburger, chicken skewers, fish tacos, and a salad) were good. Nothing blow you out of the water, but good. 

The restrooms were a complete disaster so avoid them if you can. Nothing totally wrong here, but if you are in Vegas, go someplace that is more that just a solid meal. I also thought for the quality of the food, the prices were 3-4 $ too expensive."}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for a good place to eat on the strip and ended up coming here. We waited maybe 15 minutes for a table for 10. Once we got seated the server quickly served us waters and asked if we wanted our tab split. 

As far as drinks go... What better drink to get from margaritaville than a margarita :). Margarita was well worth the $11.95 it was and we also ordered a strawberry lemonade and asked the server if they can add titos vodka which he did for an additional charge. Both drinks were great. 

Food wise we were recommended a mahi mahi special which my mom got. She enjoyed it and said was good. My dad ordered the fish tacos which he also enjoyed. My fiancé and I ordered the volcano nachos which to me were ok at best. Seemed like they had it on the warmer for a while and didn't look as good as I thought it would. My sister ordered the fish and chips which looked good. Should have got that instead. Maybe next time. 

There was a guy walking around making balloon animals for kids and told my nephews he would be back since he ran out of balloons. We waited a few minutes and I think he forgot lol. Sorry kiddos."}
{"text":"RUDE staff!  We accidentally left something behind on our table an tried to go back in to get it, but the doors were locked because they had just closed.  The bartender refused to let us in, refused to look for it himself, and instructed the rest of the staff to ignore us.  How rude!!  Will never go here again."}
{"text":"What a cool place! We arrived during lunch time on a Saturday and it wasnt busy at all. The decorations were amazing. Love the idea of sitting on a boat! Other customers may not like the loud music but I didn't mind!

I had the nacho appetizer for an entree and oh my!!
So big and yummy! It was a little pricey but worth it. Our waitress was very nice and quick.

If you get any margaritas there then you made the right decision! It was loaded with liquor! 
Don't forget to ask for a to go cup, if you don't finish!

Food: 5/5 
Service: 4/5 (Average wait)
Price: 3/5 ($20 for nachos)
Atmosphere: 5/5 (Clean, roomy building, great vibe)"}
{"text":"Sad to see less than 4 stars! Yes it's touristy but it's absolutely an experience. You must get a margarita blender and sweet potato fries!! Nachos are good too! Everyone was sharing their margarita's! We had a great time even waiting for our seat, in the guest shop, at the bar, and talking to guests and staff!"}
{"text":"Best steak, shrimp, and mash
Potatoes. They also have a little performance."}
{"text":"I have spent a whole weekend on the strip, but Margaritaville has the BEST drinks by far! The Bahama Mama is delicious! The bartenders are great and friendly as well! I definitely recommend stopping by if you are in the Vegas area!"}
{"text":"Came here just for the margaritas since we were staying across the street at Caesar's Palace. The drinks were delicious and the service was awesome! As expensive as Vegas is, the margaritas here were fairly priced:)"}
{"text":"This place cost me $35 for two small sized margarita's (came with the collectable plastic glass). The margarita's were watered down and gave me a headache from all the sugar & salt in them. Out of all the margarita's I have downed in the last few years this was the worst."}
{"text":"1.5 hr wait!!! no thanks. i'll just take my margarita on to go then.

i've eaten here a couple of times, typical bar food, nothing special. but their margaritas are pretty good!! i usually stop by here for a margarita, then i'm on my way to the next blackjack table, donating to the las vegas cause."}
{"text":"The Nachos is really good!!! And it is so so Big good for 2 people try it out. I go back all the time to get the Nachos it is  the best"}
{"text":"I am a huge Jimmy Buffett fan, and anywhere I go that has a Margaritaville restaurant, I make sure to go. I have been to several, including Montego Bay and Ocho Rios (Jamaica), Grand Cayman, Cozumel Mexico ,and Orlando Florida. This was my first visit to Vegas, and visiting the Margaritaville Restaurant was a must. 

First of all, I will briefly mention that I LOVED the casino, but will be writing a separate review for that. I love the atmosphere of this restaurant.

So as with any of the other Margaritavilles they are pricier than the average restaurant around. Although compared to other places on the strip, this is probably average priced. The food we had was great (burgers) and the drinks were excellent as well (margaritas and beer). The service was great and was definitely worth it for the experience. It is in a good location on the strip (inside of the flamingo) and you exit right across from Caesers palace and bus stops. 

When I return to Vegas I will definitely return to this Margaritaville. Outside of the Islands, this is my favorite location. The atmosphere is great, but nothing is better than a Margaritaville with a view of the ocean."}
{"text":"I've been to this location before and loved it but I don't think I wrote a review back then so here it is. My besties and I went here recently on a girl's trip and we had a great experience. Our waitress had excellent customer service skills and she was very efficient. Our drinks were never empty, when we asked what she recommended she was very thorough and down to earth.   Most of my friends had the fish tacos and they loved it. One of my friends had the buttermilk fried chicken and she loved it.  I had their signature fish sandwich. I think the fish that night was cod but whatever the case, it was delicious.  Another thing about Margaritaville that we loved was the atmosphere. We left shortly after a band started to play.  I wanted to stay but we had to go. They had a big dance floor and the next time we go there, I'm hoping we stay for the band and dance. The only thing I don't like about this restaurant is that their drinks area bit overpriced. I understand that it is on the Vegas strip and I do agree with some of the other reviewers saying it is a tourist trap. Since I've been to this restaurant before, I just ordered an iced tea while the others ordered drinks. I already have my margarita blender cup from my last trip there and I wish that they would make their margaritas a bit stronger but that's my own opinion."}
{"text":"So sue me for not checking Yelp before coming here and living to regret it.  We were tourists and totally anticipated tourist prices, so I'm not going to complain about the price.  But yeah, nothing impresses here.  The blender drinks were WAY too sweet and there was hardly any booze.  The food was mediocre.  Even service was slow and frustrating.  It has a cool atmosphere and the location was perfect since our hotel was literally a hop, skip, and a jump away.  Other than that, there's not much more positive I can add."}
{"text":"I know that I reviewed this last time I went to Vegas, but I had to do it again. As always, this was the first stop I made after checking into the hotel. 


The wait was about 30 minutes, but I went to the side bar and drank two margaritas and then our table was ready. Its always the same exact bartender regardless of what time I go to that bar, I swear she lives there! 

For the first time ever, I was seated at a table upstairs. I got the pulled pork sandwich and a few more margaritas. 

As always, I will go back. I wish I remembered the name of the waitress so I could give her a shout out, but I cant. She was great though. 

The bill was $80.00 for two of us, which I thought was great!"}
{"text":"Blech. Had to work at U of Phoenix Stadium today and Mom came down from Payson to meet me for lunch after.  I don't know Westgate at ALL except for the hockey arena.  
It's in an outdoor mall, like everything else.  We were starving and the entire mall was DEAD.  It looked like places were closed, so we went to Margaritaville for lunch.
Main entrance isn't clearly marked and we went in through the patio area.  Walked in and didn't see a reception area.  So, we asked the nearest waitress if we were to seat ourselves.  She said in her best airline stewardess voice \"Ovah they-ah is where you check-in.\"  It was fake and annoying.  So, we go check in.  15 minute-wait for 2 people.  The place was crowded, but we had passed a few empty tables along the way.  My mom even pointed it out.  \"Our kitchen is pretty backed-up, so we can't seat all tables right now.\"  Keep in mind this was at 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  Wouldn't this be the time to make sure you know to have enough kitchen staff on hand???
We meandered to the bar, which was empty except for 2 people.  We sat at the corner and, luckily, found out we could eat there.  The bartender was the first friendly person we came across, and I'm glad SHE got a tip from us.  Service was quick.  Our food came out within 10 minutes.  
Mom got the chicken quesadilla, I got the taco salad.  I couldn't believe how FEW items were on the menu.  I was expecting a bit more.  
Food was average.  Nothing I'd ever go back for.
They kept showing videos of Jimmy Buffet and the people at his concert.  They were having WAY more fun than we were.  NOBODY shouted out \"Where's the salt?  Where's the goddamn salt?\"  I would have, but my Mom's been suffering from almost 40 years of embarrassment from me already.
Blech."}
{"text":"This is a must eat place for us everytime we visit LV just cuz of the drinks.. And it close to our hotel... Get the jambalaya!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter & I stopped in to check out the new Margaritaville on the east bank of The Flats for dinner on Monday 7/24/17 at approximately 4PM.  As we walked in to the restaurant, the smell of new clothes from the very prominent gift shop was the first smell I noticed. To be fair, the place is new so it stands to reason. We were greeted cheerfully by the young ladies at the hostess station. As we were being seated by one of them, we requested a booth. There were 3 large booths along the wall, 2 of which were empty, the other had a party of 4. The place was not dead but not really busy either.  The young lady told us that they only seat parties of 6 at the booths and that these were the only booths they have.  She proceeded to seat us at a table near the middle of the room.  We ordered an appetizer & as we waited we both agreed we didn't feel comfortable at this table. I am not usually the whiny patron but I believe that if I am not comfortable with where I am seated, I will likely not have the best experience.  So we asked our waitress if we could move. She rolled her eyes, obviously annoyed & asked us just where we wanted to sit. Considering it was my first visit, I had no idea where I wanted to sit, I just knew it wasn't there. She said she would go check & see what was available. In the meantime, our appetizer, the Asiago Crab and Artichoke Dip, arrived. It was pretty good although it was served with heavily salted store bought tortilla chips. I thought for the price - $14.50 - it would be served with warm homemade tortilla chips. Did I mention that their menu prices are crazy high, with a lot of dinners running about $20 and burgers a big $15?  At this point we decided to cut our losses. We paid for our app & headed for the door, just in time to see a party of TWO being seated at one of the booths! :/"}
{"text":"Our waitress Tabatha was amazing - friendly, knowledgable about the menu and drink specials, and quick to bring our drinks and the extra limes we ordered.  She checked on us at the right times and I felt taken care of.

The dinner show is about 5 minutes long and happens every half or hour.  It was cute - would definitely bring kids.  The guys on stilts make balloon sculptures - a guy near us celebrating his 73rd birthday had a birthday cake with \"73\" on the top - all out of balloons.  You can call ahead and put your name on a list for \"priority seating\" not sure if that actually makes a difference - we were seated pretty quickly.

They have two tacos for $9.99 - I preferred the pork to the steak.  They were pretty filling - I didn't want to eat anything too big and risk a club-preventing food coma so this was just right! I'll be back for the tacos and good service!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks but we didn't like the staff very much. The waitress, Jeana, was rude and when we set up the reservation for the group the neglected to tell us they could only split it four ways. We needed about eight separate checks so it was a bit of a pain for everyone to figure out who to give money to and share a check with."}
{"text":"We had lunch here one day and drinks here two nights (because we stayed at the Flamingo and wanted someplace easy to stumble home from).

The frozen drinks are out of this world. I venture to guess I gained about 5 pounds alone just drinking the Wildberry Coladas. They were perfect. Decent selection of beer and they also serve 48oz Margaritas in a cup that looks like a blender. I hear they're $40, so I passed. 

They have a nice little area to stand just outside of the bar and watch people pass by on the Strip below. I enjoyed doing that with a Wildberry Colada or two. Or three. I can't remember.

The food is good bar food. It didn't knock my socks off, but it was good. I had the fish tacos which come served with rice pilaf, cheese, guacamole, salsa and shredded lettuce. I think they fit well with the theme of the place. My husband had a chicken sandwich which he had with onion rings which were the size of frisbees. Almost. 

We'll definitely go back for the drinks. With so many amazing choices of food on the Strip, we may not go back for a meal, but we'll definitely go back for some booze in the blender."}
{"text":"So Margaritaville will do \"preferred seating\" if you call in advance, which is basically like reservations.  However, since the only reason anyone's ever over in that part of town is because of a sporting event or other crowded event, the \"preferred seating\" goes fast.  Despite that hurdle, I still came by after my graduation ceremony at the stadium next door, and I was delighted that the wait was only 30 minutes for our party of seven.  Dining here in the daytime was a bit of a disappointment.  The music was loud, but it wasn't too festive, and I think it was coming from the tvs instead of a live band, since I never saw a band there that day.  The margarita deserves 5 stars.  Outstanding!  But the fish tacos that came highly recommended were very bad.  I ended up barely eating them.  I get very annoyed when a menu does not disclose the ingredients in a dish, and there were onions all over these tacos.  If you hate onions, don't order them.  The nachos were good, but covered in beef, so I had to eat them very carefully.  We skipped desert.  The bill for all seven, including the tips, 7 margaritas, 7 soft drinks, seven entres and an appetizer came to less than $200, so I guess that's good, right?  I'd come back if I was in the area, but I'd be more inclined, if it were daytime, to try something new in the area instead."}
{"text":"After a night of clubs and lines, Margaritaville was a welcome change.  Who cares that we were totally overdressed, it was just wonderful to have a place where a margarita cost $7.50 (especially after paying twice that much for a beer elsewhere).  

Going in the later hours of the night / early hours of the morning, there were no lines (in stark contrast to all clubs), there was a live band (not a DJ), and plenty of places to sit where you didn't have to pay the cost of a used car.

The margaritas were good, strong, and priced to impress.  Same goes for the frozen margarita/sangria concoction my friend got that was nothing short of wonderful.  Had a great time here."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out! First time I've been  here it's has a great atmosphere but it does get pretty crowded anytime of the day even on a wed afternoon! I got the perfect patron which was made very well and not watered down. We also ordered the nacho appetizer which took a little longer but the drinks made up for that."}
{"text":"Love Margaritaville!! Great people watching on the deck outside the bar, great show inside with the hottie sliding into the margarita glass & a fun atmosphere. Its on the expensive side but its Vegas what do you expect?"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. You pay premium prices for below standard food. Who puts cold onion rings on a ceasar salad? Even when the show was going on i felt depressed in this place..its not fun and it will put a big dent in your wallet. Maybe i was too sober to enjoy the food but i feel like i could have eaten anywhere for tbe same price and enjoyed myself. Keep walking....dont get sucked in"}
{"text":"Nice extension to the Flamingo Casino. It really goes with the theme, isn't very big but its nice, clean and newer. A bit of a younger crowd hangs out in this area probably because its close to restaurant. I like it! would come back again."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Ate at the bar. Brunch punch has 151 rum. Bartenders give an amazing pour. Key West omelette rocks!!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The nachos are the absolute best. HUGE. As big as they are, the staff does a decent job of making sure that there's enough of the \"good stuff\" so that you aren't left with just a ton of empty sad chips. Make sure to get an extra side of salsa, there's never enough salsa! Everything else that I have ever gotten here is alright, but the nachos are just wonderful. 

The drinks are strong and delicious. Definitely worth the price. 

The atmosphere is great. So much fun to be had. Unless you really really don't like Jimmy Buffett music.

The wait can be incredibly long for a table though. If you are just looking to grab a drink, they have a counter by the front door."}

{"text":"Stop by at the to go bar on the fight day afternoon, Catherine( bar tender) was very friendly to help us with the direction and made good recommendations for the drink. Haven't try the food yet but will come back next time in town for their food!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Great bar, good  service, great food.  

Always have a blast when the bands are playing and we;re dancing.

Stong margaritas that are good.

Their LavaLava shrimp never found in any restaurant before and is really really good!"}
{"text":"Margaritaville is pricey but what do you expect for Vegas? The good thing about it, however, is that the portions are HUGE. Split your meals when you come here and it will make up for the prices. Our server was excellent. He switched out a margarita I ordered for a different drink for free just because I thought it was too sweet and searched endlessly through the TV channels to find exactly what we wanted to watch. I highly recommend this place. Great tasting food, huge portions, and amazing service. Not to mention a nice tropical atmosphere with misters and Palm trees."}
{"text":"I love margaritas.  I knew I had to stop here while in Vegas to try it out.  Also to take a few pics to rub it into my best friend that I was here enjoying life and for him it still wasn't yet 5 o'clock.  Of course i made him jealous cuz it looked so delicious.  I started off my meal with Who's To Blame rita.  Good, but way too tart for my liking.    Next was the fish tacos.  Average at best, nothing special about the tacos. Fish seemed a bit dry.  Black beans and the rice both lacked flavor or spice.  
I can now say I have tried this place, but probably won't be back.  Only thing good was the egg roll appetizers.  The dipping sauce for these egg rolls was amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Margaritaville's and this one reminds the most of the original in Honolulu.  That being said it's a complete like all locations in the franchise, however unlike most other locations this one serves drinks continuously!  Bottoms Up!!"}
{"text":"I think the hostess should know what band is playing when you walk in the door and ask.They were friendly but not heloful."}
{"text":"TOO loud. We were seated right next to the 2 person band. After getting our drinks we asked to be moved. They got us another booth. But still too loud. I did enjoy my grill grouper sandwich and our waiter was very friendly and efficient. We asked if the music could be turned down - but it was out of his hands. We all rushed through dinner just to get away from the music. Seven us yelling across the table was just not fun. We found another place to have drinks at afterwards. Too bad as I see the loud music was a complaint on another review. While you say you take comments serious - I don't think you do. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy Buffet, so why not eat at his restaurant.  I got a large margarita that came with a glass, I collect the cocktail glasses when ever I go somewhere.  I think it was like $13 or something around that.  My dad got the regular and it was filled with more ice than anything... so always get the large which my dad usually does.  

I ate the tortilla soup, which was great! We also got the appetiser nachos because we were not that hungry.  Man those nachos could have been dinner for 2 to 3 people and I'm sure would be fantastic if your drunk or hung over.

Recap: Get Large Margarita with take away glass and NACHOS!!!!"}
{"text":"Obligatory stop in Vegas, period. 

Get the Volcano nachos, split them between a table of four, ASK FOR EXTRA CHILI, SOUR CREAM AND GUAC (because there's never enough), and you are SET. 

Don't worry about anything else on the menu but the Volcano nachos and margaritas."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. My friends and I sat on an outside patio overlooking the strip and Caesar's. 

We ordered margaritas OF COURSE which were f*cking amazing. And Nachos. Holy hell those things were HUGE. Check out my picture. We canceled our entrees after the nachos.

We sat and chilled, the waitress was awesome and fast, and its a nice experience. Definitely a great start to my Vegas vacation :)"}
{"text":"Volcano Nachos are overrated. Very unsatisfying. They get soggy really quickly. We felt ill later but were still hungry. The chili I think is what killed them and not enough cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, guacamole. Needs lime with the meal. Drinks are really good though. I recommend ordering something else. Not Nachos. Still prefer NAAM nachos in Vancouver BC"}
{"text":"The only reason we ended up here was for the $5 black jack table... that's right... table.  There is only 1, and its usually full.  Meanwhile it smells like a mix of bathroom cleaner and stale potato chips.  I'll probably avoid this place in the future.  The dealer at the $10 blackjack table was super friendly though!"}
{"text":"When you walk by this place you can not see the inside really until you walk in and see all the fun, they have employees who enjoy their jobs and really get the atmosphere really upbeat and fun, I do plan to go to this place again and will also bring out the out of town guests as well. I think everyone should experience this place. The food was good and not overly priced like some places are on the strip. Try them out you will like them!"}
{"text":"Meh. Nachos and wings were okay. Had a virgin margarita which was good. Quesadillas were average. The atmosphere is fun though!"}
{"text":"The food is very good; huge portion sizes. However just docking one star as it for some reason was realllllyyyy slow. Wasn't even full or anything, a lot of empty tables, they just seemed ridiculously short on staff."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is tropical, vacation-like theme restaurant, boats, fishing poles make you feel like you're on a tropical island or in Florida. The menu features a wide variety of foods, huge quantities or nachos feeds like 6 people. The prices are high, drinks range from $8 and up but very good. I have not tried any food on the menu, but I hear from others it is very good. Highly recommend if you're visiting Cleveland or just enjoying a day downtown."}
{"text":"It was just ok. I went here once and didn't dig the whole place. Food was alright but nothing special. I will not be back again it wasn't even comparable to other restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"I'm an avid Parrothead and have been to many Margaritavilles across the country. We stopped in here a week ago for a quick bite and drink and weren't let down. The ambiance, music, service and food were all on point and on par with the other locations I've been to. If you're looking for a cold drink and good time, it's a must see (I also recommend the nachos!)."}
{"text":"Too expensive. Food was horrible. Watermelon Margarita was way too sweet. Will never return here."}
{"text":"My family and I came here to try margaritaville out since it just opened recently. We have been to the one in Orlando at universal studios so we wanted to try this one. So you walk in and are greeted by staff and put your name in. The gift shop is also near the entrance. The decor was great- exactly what you might expect from margaritaville. It included some booths in a boat, palm leaves everywhere, lime decorations, lit up palm trees, etc. They also had a rooftop bar. We got seated and the waitress we had was very friendly and attentive. I had the blueberry pomegranate margarita, and it was delicious. My dad got the perfect margarita, and my mom got the raspberry margarita. Both report that they were very good. We ordered volcano nachos as an appetizer and they were HUGE! Complete with things like cheese, chili, jalapeños, guacamole, and a couple other things. They were soooo good and so filling. For our meals, I just got a burger with fries. It was very good- cooked perfectly. My dad got a Cuban and said it was outstanding. My mom and sister both got a club sandwich and they were the biggest sandwiches I've ever seen. Both reported that it was delicious. Overall, I would recommend coming here. Great experience."}
{"text":"Stay away from this restaurant, the price is so high, the food is disgusting. The worst Mexican food I ever tasted."}
{"text":"Been coming here since the place opened.  Ok, only two or three times a year on my visits to make deposits to the casino banks.  The Cheeseburger in Paradise is my favorite, but the steak salad is close.  For those who love onion rings - look no further -theirs are the best.  Since my drinking days are over, can't comment on that, but the food and the service, and the FUN! are exception.  Great videos, great volcano show, not to mention the décor (some may not like it), but I really enjoy the sportfishing 'boat' as well as Jimmy's giant amphib flying over the restaurant.  First saw JB in concert in 1976, so I might be a little biased, lol!"}
{"text":"I was not going to write a review about the slow food, the mixed up orders, or the late margarita because I liked our friendly waitress and the young man with the cute hat at the front desk. However, I was compelled to write after using the restroom. First, my stall had a broken lock, so I had to hold the door shut the entire time, which I could manage because the distance to the door from the toilet was so short. However, the toilet paper rolls where not locked, leaving the 20 pound rolls free to spin off if the dispenser every time I tried to pull from the roll. Using two hands would have been a solution, but I was already holding the door. Of course I survived, but the bathroom needed serious picking up as well. All in all, the place needs more time to work as a cohesive team. The food was ok."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, but that is where the pleasantries end. As many others have stated, the food here is very sub par. You could cut the menu prices in half and threat would not make up for the low quality. Lets start with the kids meals. Ten bucks for a small overcooked chicken breast and a small portion of bland rice. Nuff said on that one. The grilled cheese made me think of the old Wendy's commercial, \"Where's the cheese?\" All bread and not much else. My pasta dish was lukewarm, to salty. The sauce was like creamy water, not thick and sticking to the noodles. Sorely lacking in chicken as well. My wife's burger, while good sized, was a grease bomb and way to much bun. But on second thought, good thing the bun was there to soak up all the fat dripping from the burger.

Server was friendly, but slow. It was not busy, was mid afternoon and the place only had a few other patrons, at the time.

Not much of a chance that we'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok, so I feel I am being a tad bit generous with the 2 stars...anyways here goes...

I feel my review is pretty valuable as I have dined at this restaurant once last year and once this year. 

Was not impressed the first visit in 2010 as I had high hopes. Was really hoping the whole \"Cheeseburger in paradise\" thing would be something real and not just a mirage. 

The location is great, business is always booming which they owe to the Tourist big time, and Flamingo hotel and casino as well since they have a direct corridor to access the restaurant. I thank you myself Flamingo for parking :)

Heads up...this place is ALWAYS busy from opening til closing so if you are looking for a peaceful sanctuary for a first date or some under the table romance, uh uh ain't happening, simply not an option here!

First visit-
Busy, service was very bad this particular day, the waitress as I call these \"types\" was a threesome, and not the good kind either. Meaning 3 visits to our table, 1. take order, 2 drop food, 3 drop check. Not the service you expect and deserve when dining out. When you are forced to flag down other waiters and bussers to get a refill, it's just bad.
Food was overpriced and mediocre at best! Burger, dry, flavorless, bun was hard as if had been sitting in the sun for a bit. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich which was dry, overcooked, another bad hard crusty bun. The fries, not impressive, won't even say what they tasted like or had the consistency of. Bad fries, come on, no excuse. 

Second visit-
Margaritas good yes considering that is the name of this establishment. Food again, bad, this time my meal was cold and I am not talking about my tossed salad either. I decided to order the salmon this time, ok did not have a good experience with the burger last time let's try seafood... I left just as hungry as when I had walked in the door also. Ugh, bland food and again bad service another threesome waitress, wtf? Is this policy? I give up, another large bill paid after being bent over and stuffed with a whole giant frozen pickle. 

Never again...I am beyond dissapointed...the feeling of leaving unsatisfied is simply cruel.

The atmosphere and drinks are cool...the food and service...not so much!"}
{"text":"Mango margarita on the rocks.  Strong.  Delicious.  A little pricey, but oh so good.  The atmosphere here is fun!  I've eaten here plenty of times... the food is good.  Again, a little pricey... but you're in Las Vegas, center strip.  Deal with it.  This is a very convenient place to stop while passing by.  There is PLENTY of bar real estate whether you want to stop and sit to drink or run up to the \"to-go\" counter and order one (or two) for the road.  The service has always been incredible and the entertainment in the evenings is loud and wild and fun.  I'm pretty sure my father-in-law is still thinking about the Volcano girl that slides down into the giant margarita during dinner hours.  If you're in the area - stop in.  Order a burger.  Douse it in Heinz 57... Jimmy Buffet would be proud.  And kick back some margaritas.  It all makes for a very good time."}
{"text":"I'm not down with restaurants that are decorated as if someone took a ride on Disneyland's Jungle Boat Cruise and thought they were hit with interior design brilliance, i.e. Rain Forest Cafe, Islands....ya feel me?  To me, these restaurants have more of an appeal to kids and I'm supposed to be getting tanked there so I can tolerate the screaming rugrats? Ha.

Well, this place wasn't overrun with kids watching their parents throw back shots of tequila and that was a plus.  So after the nice hostesses told us that we could seat ourselves at the bar, my friend and I planted ourselves at the one downstairs.  Our bartender was a friendly gal.  I asked for a drink menu which didn't have the most exciting concoctions, but I chose to order the Uptown Top Shelf margarita from her.

My drink was pretty good, but what surprised me about this one was that I had expected the drink to come out of a gun.  Hot damn, she free-poured it right in front of my face!  

Now, with a restaurant named Margaritaville, one, or at least I, would expect that there would be an impressive selection of tequila.  Not here.  I spied about 5 different brands and that was it.  That was really disappointing so much so that instead of doing shots of Patron, my friend & I opted to try something off of the shot menu called an Overseas High made with blue curacao.  Not bad for something fruity.

My experience there was ok for a little pre-gaming to see the Coyotes.  Two of these stars go to the bartender's service and attitude.  The other star is for the drink prices.  Someone from L.A. can double their BAC level here."}
{"text":"Please. No matter your budget. Leave this place. They are awful. They treat you like shit. I had a simple request: clean a table recently vacated. The response was \"maybe when we feel like it\"

They don't Deserve our money"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this....but I just didn't. Building is beautiful. 
Our wait was reasonable...45 min. Margarita at 5oclock bar. Bar tender openly sneezing repeatedly in her hand then grabbing straws and drinks....no washing. No sanitizing. Yuck.
Waitress was totally unfamiliar with menu. Food was not great. Ok, but overpriced.
Music was VERY annoying. It reminded me of annoying Abercrombie shopping music. Buffet music squeezed in sometimes but mainly bro-country/dance mix......way loud.
Finished on beautiful outside Land Shark Bar. No hurry on bartenders part. No real atmosphere....although the facility itself is amazing.
I hope they can pull it together. I was overall disappointed."}
{"text":"Our last several hours spent in Vegas were dedicated to visiting Margaritaville for both a good meal and drinks. We were also expecting to be able to get our hands on the tall, long margarita cups that we assumed were sold here, but we were disappointed to find out that we were at the wrong place for this. Nonetheless, it did not prevent us from having our final meal in Vegas.

Upon arrival, we noticed a handful of people waiting to be seated and hoped that it wouldn't be a long wait as our flight departed in a couple hours. Luckily, from the time we requested a table to actually being seated, it was no more than 15 minutes. Our server assisted us within 5 minutes of being seated and took our drink orders. There were a variety of drinks to choose from; I ordered the Big Rita on the rocks and also was interested in the Mango Frozen margarita. Both were excellent and brought to us 5 minutes after ordering them. We didn't order appetizers but it was really amazing seeing what the Volcano nachos looked like at the table next to ours. One word describes them: humongous! As for our food, we ordered burgers, quesadillas, and a chicken burger, all of which came with fries. The food was much better than expected and delicious. The burger was full of flavor and went perfectly with my drink. 

The staff was friendly, the portions were generous and the overall quality excellent.  The prices are reasonable with the drinks always being expensive as with the rest of Vegas."}
{"text":"Friday night / Spring Break / March Madness = Crazy Busy but only had to wait 30 minutes for a table, not bad!  Our waitress CINDY was very good!  We took our 3 kids and they had a blast.  The Giants on Stilts made them balloon art (best I've ever seen) and made them laugh!  The DJ took requests from our kids and we all cheered them on as they danced!  The Volcano nachos were HUGE!!  The Margarita's were so yummy!  The kids loved their burgers!  The kids were all requesting to come back soon.

TIP: Valet is a long ways away so if you have problem walking or have to be carried out don't park in Valet!"}
{"text":"Seems small compared to the Vegas location, but has the usual parrothead vibe."}
{"text":"We always stop here when in Vegas and this time we just grabbed some seats at the bar instead of waiting for a table.  Our bartender was super friendly and basically made me double rum drinks when I asked him to for the regular price.  Always fun to hang with other Parrotheads at Margaritaville!"}
{"text":"5 Stars for service. 

Kris and Tony are amazing bartenders! Best service in the flats! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"First stop for our vegas trip.. My sister ordered the fish tacos they were yummy and I ordered the rancho deluxe burger which was delicious.. Chips and salsa weren't what we expected all you can taste was garlic on the salsa.. We also ordered 5 o'clock somewhere which was bomb.com highly recommend this drink"}
{"text":"We sat at the 5 o'clock somewhere bar. It was around 5 o'clock. Not exactly the most happenin' place on the strip, but the bartenders were cool and super talented with their showmanship when making drinks. And the drinks were good and strong."}
{"text":"High priced ordinary food and drinks that aims to trap tourists and unsuspecting folks from other parts of the valley coming to a game at one of the stadiums.  Service is painfully slow.  Loud as hell in here too.  Food is average to below average, basic bar fare."}
{"text":"We stop here every time we hit Vegas for the Volcano Nachos. Thought I learned my lesson last time, but also added another appetizer for the two of us and had a ton of food leftover again. Next time just the nachos and Margaritas!"}
{"text":"My buddies and I decided to hit up the west side last night and visited Margaritaville.  It was one of the most fun nights out that I have had in quite some time.

We got there and lucked out and were able to get a table in the bar area that was in a prime location with views of everything going on.  From there on, the night just kept getting better and better.

I'll start with the food.  Everything that we ordered (peel n' eat shrimp, tortilla soup, jambalaya, fish tacos, and the \"cheeseburger in paradise\") were excellent.  Our server was one of the friendliest, coolest girls that we have ever met, and made sure that there was never an empty bottle of beer on our table.

As for the atmosphere, this was a tale of two worlds.  As the night began for us (right around 8:00), it seemed like the complete opposite of a night out in the Scottsdale area.  There were actually more girls in the place out and about and having fun than there were guys.  Plenty of cute girls (not a single one fitting the \"Scottsdale\" mold) from all walks of life outnumbered the guys by a 3:1 ratio.  I'm so used to heading out to places where it is just a sausage-fest with all the guys there that I almost didn't know what to do with myself.  And the dudes that were there were normal as well, very casually dressed and just there having a good time with the group of people they came with.  Plus people weren't there trying to pick up on folks and act all cool, but rather there just to enjoy a night out.  Then, almost as the clock struck midnight, things changed.  Suddenly it seemed that the place filled up with the \"Scottsdale crowd,\" meaning girls all done up and dudes that looked (and acted) like complete douche bags.  It turned into a sausage fest full of people normally found on the other side of town.  After viewing ridiculous and immature behavior by the new crowd, we settled up and left.

The band that performed there this night was AMAZING.  They started at 10:00pm and played covers of popular songs from many genres of music.  There was a small area down by the stage for dancing, and as the night went on more and more people were out there dancing and having a good time.

I definitely plan to make this a regular occurrence on Friday nights.  The drive out from where I live in Tempe was well worth it.  I'll just make sure to leave before midnight next time."}
{"text":"This has always been my go-to place every time I am in Vegas with my wife simple because it's Margaritaville and of course, Jimmy Buffet genre music playing.  However; my last visit earlier this year was a little disappointing.  Volcano was not working, employees did not seem to have that excitement or fun to be working there attitude I have been used to.  Even the menu has changed in the past year.. What!! No more Jamaican Jerk Wings????  It's Margaritaville for crying out loud!! I even asked about access to their top roof bar and one employee stated the section was permanently closed.  I'm not much of a business man and to be fare, I not privy to the full details on the reason for this, but in my opinion, a roof top bar is always a plus in Vegas and killer revenue generator.  In the past, the roof top bar at Maragaritaville has always been great for \"Al-Fresco dinning, view of the Vegas strip, and people watching while enjoying a perfect margarita.  Maybe making the roof top bar a primary seating section and the main floor secondary could be an option?  I really hope there are plans to bring some or all of the original ambiance back to this place as it would be a shame to go away. Never the less, I will be back in Vegas this summer and yes... Margaritaville will still be one of my stops just because I am a boat drunk too.."}
{"text":"The service was good.  The wings were tasty.  The crab cake sandwich was a huge disappointment.  I've had these 10x better at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  We couldn't get a table inside, so thank god for the misters outside (felt like at least the mid 80's that evening)."}
{"text":"On our 1st anniversary trip to Vegas, we checked out Margaritaville located in Flamingo. We had the tacos and flavored margaritas which were nice. It was very festive inside with live music. Had fun. This place is recommended for families with kids"}
{"text":"Bartenders can't remember a customer from less than 24 hours ago???! Wtf?! Had a nice gentlemen order is shots of a special shot and this lady acts like she doesn't want to remember me and not give service!??? Lady with short hair barely below the ears....was awesome on Thursday night and then Friday she suddenly got amnesia on what we ordered and didn't want to help us order drinks ?! Highly disappointed with this casino too how do you know have an atm next to the roulette table??? \"House always comes out ahead here\" is your rep step it up or take a loss 
Learn how to market to a casino you guys didn't get one star from me 
Will get drunk and drop $$ somewhere else Zero to a female dog real quick.....thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"Went to the bar here....the bartender carded my bf and I both, twice...wasn't too fond of that...drinks were expensive, not that strong, decent."}
{"text":"For my 50th birthday I had a large group of 13 people attend Mat Franco's magic show at the Linq hotel.

With such a large group it was difficult to decide on a place to eat prior to the show.

We decided to leave a couple hours early for the show and play it by ear once we got to the hotel. As luck would have it, there was a Margaritaville right next store to the Linq hotel.

We were worried with such a large group and no reservation; they wouldn't be able to accommodate us. The staff did an excellent job of putting together a nice table on the bar side for our group.

Our waitress was on top of everything from the start. Drinks to appies to dinner to dessert, everything was perfect without error. She even split our bill up for us so there was no confusion in calculating what everyone owed.

My wife and I split the Pretzel Sticks. I enjoyed those very much. For my main, I had the Cheeseburger in Paradise. I have to say I was a little disappointed as there didn't seem to be a lot of flavour in the burger. I also had the fries with it and wished I had gone with the sweet potatoes instead. They were actually pretty good, from what I stole off my wife's plate!

I also have to say is it was very loud. The longer we stayed and the more people that arrived for dinner and drinks, the crazier it got. That's to be expected when you're seated in the bar side of the restaurant. I bet this place is nuts after 10:00 pm!

Thank you to restaurant and staff for fitting us in on such short notice!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff...good service...alcohol is a little low budget...just doesn't appeal to me for some reason....except the walk up bar...guess I have to give it 4 stars because they are so good though..."}
{"text":"Had some time to kill, wanted a decent cheeseburger for lunch, Was seated right away and the burger and fries were just what I needed. Fun atmosphere of course, although I'm not much of a Jimmy Buffet fan, but lively decor and feel. My server was Alisha and she had a pleasant demeanor and made me feel welcomed. One thing I've got to say that really set this place apart; I'm a local, and it was refreshing to see a staff that is not a bunch of models. When going out in Vegas, it gets a little weary when so many places want good looking model-types that are attractive, but don't always seem to have a knack for the business. The whole 'wear a bathing suit to the interview\" thing is a bit insulting. The staff I encountered yesterday were hard working Americans of all shapes, sizes, and ethnic backgrounds, and it was refreshing! They were just like me! They were all running around and being busy and seemed to enjoy themselves. No one had to show lots of skin to solicit a bigger tip. This made me feel at home, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Always busy, we hit this place to start our Vegas vacation. We have to go thru the gift shop to see the latest in Parrothead couture!

Oh, yeah, the food. It's okay."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go when in Vegas.  Great food and a good price.  The nachos would feed two football offensive linemen.  Easy to order one dish to feed two because of large portion size.  Great atmosphere and good food.  Of course the margaritas are the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Great for kids!

We're on a family trip to Las Vegas with 3 kids (1, 3, & 5) and are always on the lookout for places we can go with them.  We stopped in at 5:30 on a Sunday and it was busy but not packed.  I'd highly recommend the 3rd floor (rooftop) level, they were very accommodating and the kids loved the view.  As it got dark, we could see lots of lights and the Bellagio fountains during some parts of that show.  

WARNING:  The kids meals are enormous.  We easily could've fed all 3 kids with one meal.  

We paid just under $100 for the whole family (that included a margarita for both adults)."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Flamingo with some friends and we knew we wanted to try this place. The table we sat at was a little awkward and high-up, but man was this place cool. It was all boats and giant glowing green blenders.

I was on a bit of a budget and also needed something mild and fresh for my stomach, so I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tostadas... My Goood. It's like a tostada with some daikon (which I've been craving for over a year) and some seared tuna and then delicious seaweed salad on top. This dish was attractive and satisfying as hell. I was mega-pleased."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was much more excited about this place BEFORE I went to it. It isn't a bad bar, per se- but definitely did not live up to the hype. and the drinks are more pricey than they should be for the flavor.  If I can make a better margarita than a place called \"Margaritaville\", well- then I will save myself the money and make them at home.  However- when they do the live music on the weekends- it is a great time."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and great music. It has a creative vibe and colorful decor. Shrimp and grits was delicious."}
{"text":"Getting a table isn't easy, but when you do it's worth it!  Food was good, drinks were also good, you just have to be patient because there is a lot going on and the servers are overwhelmed.   Price point was was on level with the food and I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Worst $14.00 dollar salad I ever had. Would have given zero stars. Three pieces of mango, limp iceberg lettuce no other greens, 1/8 cup of tiny chopped tomatoes & cucumbers. Smother in a paste of salad dressing.
Wait person never refilled my water. 
My husbands meal was just as bad.
This restaurant running on reputation alone."}
{"text":"Been here several times
Parking and getting in may be difficult 
My parents gave me thier Diamond Cards, so I get seated promptly
Service is good whether you sit at the bar or tables
Never sent anything back, 
It's a chain so expect a lot of tourists walking in from the street 
But I have been there with several local friends. 
Nice bartenders 
Great gift shop too."}
{"text":"Started off good. Nachos were good. Drinks were good. The food poisoning my mom and I now have from eating there? Not so good. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is great ! Good food and service. 5 stars and I am under 50 years old!"}
{"text":"It does take a while to get seated. We waited for about 25 mins or so. There is a lot of people around 6pm. The interesting thing is that they have these people who walk on those wooden thingys that make them really tall and they make balloon animals and stuff. We stayed long enough to see the volcano erupt with margarita and there's this girl that slides down into a cup filled with margarita. She does a little dance. The volcano nachos were really good! we asked for more guacamole and it was free. We also had the coconut fried shrimp with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. It was okay. The shrimp was fried too crispy and hard. The veggies were too soft. The mashed potatoes was the only good thing. I didn't get to try the drinks here though. The atmosphere here is a bit too noisy for me and my bf."}
{"text":"Amazing as any Margaritaville but with the added bonus of a themed casino attached to the restaurant.  Don't miss nickle beer at 5 o'clock!"}
{"text":"I was not thrilled with the margarita at all. I told the waitress no salt for my blended margarita and she still put salt on the rim. The appetizers were soso, and the atmosphere was boring."}
{"text":"So with all the places to eat in Vegas, how did this Yelper end up at a chain? Well, let's just say it wasn't my choice :)  We also had some timing issues, as we were about to go to a show.  

    Busy Tuesday night, but we got right in, probably because we didn't care where we sat, which was a good thing, because we were given a table with little to no view of the \"show\".  But that's what legs are for...standing up and moving to where you CAN see the show.  (something I did, but Husband didn't, which was his loss as it was cute entertainment that involved a gal in a bikini, water, splashing and guys on stilts)

    We were definitely away from the balloon hat guy also.  And away from quick service and drink refills, but not too bad.

    Not starving, we decided to share a Caesar Salad and the Triple Decker Club.  (Husband was in need of something pretty plain).   And that's what we got.  Plain.  The salad tasted like one of those plastic bag \"kits\" you can buy at the grocery store.  
The sandwich was decent."}
{"text":"My husband just came in at the spare of the moment to stop for some lunch and it ended up being pretty good. We ended up staying about an hour later watching the crowds walk by and ended up leaving having a great time over all, the drinks were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Touristy and fun, it's hard to not have a good time at Margaritaville.

My friend decided to have her birthday dinner here and we had a blast. The bartenders are friendly and they have the huge blenders of mixed drinks that are hard to resist. 

There is a silly show with guys on stilts and a hula dancer sliding down a waterslide into a giant margarita glass. They guys on stilts wander around between shows and offer balloon hats for the price of a tip. They were quite elaborate and my friend ended up with the perfect photo accessory. 

The food was forgettable, so stick to the overpriced drinks and silliness."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 10 to start out the night for my sisters bachelorette party. Despite my call ahead days in advance for our priority seating, we had to wait for 30 minutes which in turn after eating, made us almost miss our show! I will say the chicken fingers I had were surprisingly the best I've ever eaten"}
{"text":"What a fun bar.  The atmosphere was really cool.  
Most importantly, the live band that was performing such great cover songs. totally awesome!!"}
{"text":"I hate Jimmy Buffett music.  Why do I even come here?  I went here once out of curiosity, and then the other 4 or 5 (yes really, that many) times I have been because that's where everyone else already was and we got invited.  Let me remind you, I hate Jimmy Buffett music.  It's so annoying!

Aside from the fact that I am inundated with music that I can't stand, and usually it's the same three songs over and over, the food here is not bad.  I usually get the coconut shrimp because they are always crispy and they actually taste like there is some coconut on them, unlike most places that like to overcharge you for \"coconut\" shrimp.  It also comes with a really yummy marmalade dipping sauce.  I actually love their peel and eat shrimp though.  I think they are boiled in beer or something, and they come in a big giant clam dish filled with ice.  Kind of weird, but it makes me laugh.  The shrimp themselves are really yummy, tasting exactly like peel and eat shrimp should.  The cocktail sauce they serve with it is a really nice pairing to the shrimp.  It's moderately spicy so it doesn't kill my tastebuds before I am finished eating.

The service here is usually lacking.  Well, I take that back, it's always lacking.  You have to track someone down to get refills.  Aside from that, I have never found any of my servers to be particularly personable there.  Maybe it's because they hate Jimmy Buffett music too and they are miserable because they work there.  Or maybe they are just sick of dodging that stupid person on stilts who makes balloon thingies.  I hate that person.

Considering there isn't a whole lot to do in Westgate, Margaritaville isn't a bad option.  It gets crowded really easily though, so put your name in early or come on a non weekend night.  This place is just okay, but the tourist factor appeals to a lot of people."}
{"text":"It was super hot so my friends & I wanted something cold to cool us down. Decided on the Euphoria Daiquiri. Tried the Mango and the Wild Berry. Mango is sweeter and Wild Berry is more tart for those who like it sour. 

I am a lightweight when it comes to alcohol but I didn't feel much after drinking it so it's safe for you one shot wonders out there :)"}
{"text":"Best nachos in town and I eat nachos everywhere.  My family and I go to this inconvenient and pricey place just for the nachos.  Locals this is a must try but don't venture out for any other food just stick with nachos they are amazing."}
{"text":"A nice stop on the Las Vegas strip. Nice decor, awesome margaritas! All of them were good, especially the Last Mango in Paris and Pomegranate Margarita. Got to sample a few of the dishes, not too shabby. The pulled pork was tender, had a sweeter taste to it though. The chicken and broccoli pasta was a bit bland, not too creamy either. Burgers were good. I give it 3.5 stars just because it's Vegas."}
{"text":"There's nothing better than a fun group of people, warm weather and a Mai Tai in my hand.  Yes, I'm that easy to please. The Volcano Nachos and strawberry daiquiris are way good too.  

If your crew is into margaritas, there is this jumbo concoction that you can order.  It's a huge tube filled with margarita dispensed through a tap.  It sits at your table for you to use at your convenience.  They say it serves up to eight, but a group of 4 at our table made short work of the contents within an hour :)  A word to the wise, try and get them to change the tequila they use to a top shelf brand; their homemade concoction is icky (and has made some of the folks at my table sick in the past).

One other note, there is an lovely outdoor patio upstairs (on the 3rd floor?) with plenty of shade.  The line for seating up there was MUCH shorter than the line downstairs.  We were told that our party of 12 would be seated in 2 hrs. downstairs, so we left our name, but then went upstairs to try our luck.  We were seated in 35 minutes, yay!"}
{"text":"They had a gluten free menu online I could look at before deciding to make the walk from our hotel. They had a good selection on the menu;  not just items like \"burger, no bun.\" The food was tasty and our service was fantastic. I would definitely recommend them to others who need to find gluten free restaurant options in Vegas."}
{"text":"What do you expect from a chain named after a song? mediocre food, weak margaritas and way too loud to have conversation. volcano Nachos - they should be ashamed of themselves - bigger is rarely better and Velveeta never is.  Caesar salad - flavorless. Jerk Salmon was DROWNED in BBQ sauce - hello?"}
{"text":"Was expecting more. The margarita was average and there was no live music or anything. Just seemed like a random place to hang out. Granted I didn't hang out long, it didn't provide enough to keep me stationary."}
{"text":"the food at Margaritavilla over priced, with a total of $61 for 2 hamburgers and 2 drinks plus tip. The place was so dark, I was unable to see what I was eating and the music was so loud you had to shout. This is a theme restaurant of Jimmy Buffet and the food is nothing special. Doesn't Jimmy already make enough money?  I should of use the money on the 24 hour food buffet, instead of Buffett."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Flamingo, and figured that coming here would be a awesome place to get some grub. It may be a little touristy, but who cares.. you aren't from there! I got to Tropical Margarita GUAVA flavor and it was really good. Just a good balance of alcohol, tequila, and guava ! Blended of course! I was feeling a little ill so I ordered the tortilla soup which was pretty okay. My friends ordered the seafood mac and cheese and it had \"perfectly melted cheese both white and yellow cheese with the crisp\" It was so good they talked about it all weekend. 
It was also fun to see someone come out of a volcano and slide into a giant pitcher! 
Since it was touristy, prices were not cheap. $10 margaritas, and 20+ for mac and cheese! go figure :)"}
{"text":"Solid mid priced fare in a fun setting.  Nothing fancy but you WILL have a good time here.  If you don't, it's your own damn fault.

Steer clear of the house margaritas though - not sure what mix they use but it is beyond awful.  Stick to beer and water...you'll be much happier.  And so will your hangover.

Had the drunken shrimp appetizer, caesar salad, friend chicken and key lime pie (didn't eat all of everything - I'm only 130 lbs....it was a 4 course special event menu so I had a bite or two of each course...)  

Everything came out hot/prepared well and the service was spot on.  There was entertainment and even a band and dancing after 10:30.  Good times."}
{"text":"* Good for kids or ten years old adults.

* Giant size NACHOS. I'm not kidding, the nachos is the size of my head combined with another person's head.

* I had the Hawaiian type burger and it was just ok. The meat was good, but the buns got soggy really quick and they put waaaaaayyyy too much lettuce on it. The last time I check, I'm not quite a herbivore yet....

* There are better restaurants in Vegas...I think..."}
{"text":"Always a fun time. Kinda pricey and food isn't great and you need to add more liquor to your Rita to feel anything, but fun and great energy. Lots of people and good music"}
{"text":"Hey, Management!! You absolutely MUST take these reviews seriously. We went on Sunday during the Taste of Cleveland. The place was SEVERELY under-staffed for the kind of business that can be expected during a big weekend like that. Waited 10 minutes for server to greet us & take beverage order. Once order was in, we waited 20 minutes before getting our drinks. No water offered during this time even though it was requested. Was told that the bar was really backed up which was an indicator of how the kitchen might be operating. With two kids in tow, waiting longer was not an option. We decided to close out after our drinks and eat dinner at home. This place has the opportunity & the chance to be a really fun place for families to go downtown in the summer. But there's no a chance I'll return any time soon! 2 stars only because the margarita was good."}
{"text":"The food we ate here was really gross. I had a taco salad. Maybe those are never good, but it was full of dressing, the lettuce was soggy. Friend had a burger, nothing to write home about. The guy serving us stopped coming over and we could see him watching a sports game in the back. We spent almost $80 which was not worth the food or the service."}
{"text":"I can't believe there r people giving this place a 5 star, most likely those reviews r fake. Maybe the margaritas r ok but the food.... Worst food I have had in a while. We ordered the volcano nachos, it was old and soggy. \"Signature\" Fish and chips: fish wasn't fresh, cole slaw was bland. Grilled chicken breast: super overcooked and salty: Cesar Salad with chicken, the chicken looked like left over from last night. Gross food, average service."}
