{"text":"Place is bomb ... Love this place I recommend this place a lot one of my favorites in phx"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!!!   The place is tiny cantina  and doesn't look like much from the outside. When we visited, a Sunday afternoon about two weeks ago, it was packed.  The food was incredible, and the wait staff very friendly and courteous.  They asked us about our spice preferences and adjusted the heat of the dish accordingly. Our tostadas were to die for and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pro: Good food         Family oriented          Friendly service   Cons: Not professional at all             Poor set up            Lack of cleanliness   Don't walk in expecting a restaurant style service. Think of it as if your going to your friends aunts cousins house to have lunch. The food is good but there's certain things that bring up red flags. Most bothersome was the lack of change in gloves even after watching them touch all sorts of things such as the broom. Overall very good food and awesome people but definitely needs work with the cleanness of it all."}
{"text":"This place is actually really freaking good. Plain and simple it didn't disappoint. But the reason for the three stars not four or even five is simply because the plate that I got was told was going to be spicy and somewhat like an agua chile so I get it first it wasn't spicy it tasted freaking delicious but not spicy at all second I was told It had raw shrimp it didnt. It did have everything else and tasted really amazing but it also had more onion and cucumber that's Seafood. Some people that were in there had like mussels spicy but I didn't see them on the menu.   I'm from California and have had my fair share of seafood. This places ranks in my top 10 if it means anything. Forgot to mention it is a little pricey but w.e it was good."}
{"text":"First time wife and I went to fily's and weren't disappointed,food taste really good but.....is a very small place and service is not the best . I got la seca which is like 2 cocktails on a plate with lots of seafood  ,wife got tostada special also very good. I didn't ask but I saw no beer around so maybe?. I will go back to try more stuff."}
{"text":"Best shrimp cocktails ever. You won't find anything better than this place for cocktails. What else? SUPER CHEAP!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best place for mariscos in the valley located Glendale right before 67th Ave on the north side of Glendale Ave all I can say that this place was amazing great hospitality good service and they don't skimp on the seafood if your looking for mariscos look no more make sure to stop buy and have a tostada or two or even a cocktail"}
{"text":"Not the greatest, I've had better seafood. The aguachile wasn't even aguachile, the campechana juice was very thick and kind of grows. Would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great place! If you're looking for aguachiles or ceviche this is the spot. They have huge portions so a small is enough! The customer service is great. The only reason I am giving four stars is because the wait is always long (but worth it)."}
{"text":"Just GO THERE!..simply put IT'S BOMB!..I go there often and I'm as picky as they come for seafood, again..JUST GO THERE to see for yourself, you WON'T be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Very Very Good!! Shrimp cocktail was delicious $14 for a small but it was loaded with shrimp. Ceviche tostadas were really good also! The chips were so crispy went great with the cocktail! Def a spot we will be back to. Constant wait outside as soon as someone was done the table was turned over."}
{"text":"Came out to Padres spring training all the way from San Diego, and woke up craving some mariscos we googled this place and gotta say the service was excellent and the food was great, big portions for a great price ,will be back again."}
{"text":"One of the best Mariscos Restaurant in Phoenix! Everything taste great. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time.  Chose this place based on a yelp recommendation.  I thought I would bring some ceviche to a Cinco de Mayo party, and theirs was awesome.  Staff was very friendly as well.  I would recommend take out unless it was for lunch, because of the old, unconfomtable tables and chairs, and the smallness of the room.."}
{"text":"This place has great AUTHENTIC mariscos! It is a small place. The staff was friendly, and efficient. Come with a little bit of patience because this place gets pretty busy! My fianc√© and I shared a large \"seco\" plate. It's was amazing! Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Good place. Authentic seafood, good service. Very small place but delicious food. I would definitely good back"}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant very often and I love it! It's THE best seafood I've had in the U.S. I order \"agua chiles\" (small) and they're so tasty! Their portions are huge so I recommend to order a small since the large can be enough for two average people. Its usually pretty packed and the wait can be longer than usual but it's totally worth it! I will continue to come here once my seafood cravings kick in!"}
{"text":"Food was good, pretty expensive I paid $20 for a small agua chile but the plate was big..   Pro: good food (what else is there to go for? I know I know)   Cons: really cramped space, the set up is awful.. a bit humid. The staff wasn't helpful at all I walked in sat down and the waitress helped someone that came in 5 minutes after us first. We waited about 10 minutes to even get menus or speak to someone who worked there. The customer service is crap, nobody even bothered to come and ask how things were going through out the whole time we were there. My partner had to get up to ask for more chips and again to ask for the bill. The table was dirty when we came in and there was only about 10 napkins in the holder.. they don't seem to clean any of their salsas or salt shakers either. The staff had messy hair and dirty clothes. I wouldn't be surprised if i get food poisoning.  Would recommend this place FOR TAKE OUT don't even bother going in to sit down."}
{"text":"Best sea food spot in Arizona! The flavor is just amazing have been eating files sea food for years now! Agua chiles are amazing she has this signature sauce that's truly delicious. If you live in Arizona or here for vacation & are looking for a great local spot to eat the best sea food in town this is the spot."}
{"text":"This place is very good. It is quite literally a hole in the wall and if you are not looking for it you will drive right past it. In fact I've been driving by it for years until someone pointed it out to me. I do not regret finally making it in. The prices are kind of high, but there is not much in the way of Mariscos around the valley so you can charged whatever you want and we will still come. If you know the difference between real mariscos and just plain seafood, you will love this place."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite aguachile. Definitely coming back! Definitely recommend. Service is great, food is amazing. I would give this more stars if I could."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall does not disappoint. Located in a busy strip mall. Nothing fancy inside, just chairs, tables, a tv and delicious mariscos. Fresh seafood, nothing here is cooked. They have the real Mexican coke in the bottles, few other bottled selections, and canned soda. Friendly folks running the place, despite the language barrier it was a great meal and we'll be back"}
