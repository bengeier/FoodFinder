{"text":"Three hairs in your first bite...really? lolll...
Although this place seems to have undergone some changes since my first experience years ago - it continues to serve good subs with quality ingrediets at a very reasonable price. Delivery is always fast."}
{"text":"Ick,ick,ick... not a very good sub at all. Cheap on the meats lack of freshness on the bread , had a tiny modly spot on the bread. Ordered a poutine was a tiny bit better but had much better. First and last time i will dine here."}

{"text":"They've been around for a while and it's been a long time since I've eaten there.

They serve American-style cuisine consisting of subs, burgers, pizza and fries. They got pasta and chicken, too.

Their subs I found to be tasty and I had no issues with food quality.

With the plain decor and run-of-the-mill menu, they may not be the King of Subs anymore, but it's still worth a gander if you're passing through Ville St. Pierre."}
{"text":"THREE LARGE HAIRS ON THE FIRST BITE...but more on that later. 

My girlfriend and I ordered on a whim one night and we each got the two for one 14 inch steak and cheese subs. The delivery was very fast and the food looked great although for boasting about long subs they are quite thin so it's not as much as say a 12 inch sub at Subway. We ordered a poutine with our subs. The food itself was not great, it tastes like any other sub I've ever had and the same goes for the poutine. It was normal run-of-the-mill food that was not special in any way. The first bite of my sub produced three long hairs IN my food, not on it by mistake where it clearly accidentally fell.I had to literally pull them from my teeth. The King of subs is clearly the peasant."}
