{"text":"Hair in food, fly in cup!!! Need I say more?

TBH didn't find their food that bad but the quality and cleanness is completely unacceptable. And the service is horrible, waitress would be on her phone until someone calls her over. Definitely would not recommend this to anyone unless I have deep hatred for that person."}
{"text":"All of the staff here have changed and the food has changed with them.

We used to come here at least twice a month. We would always get the same 3-4 dishes, plus one dish on the menu we haven't tried yet, and tonight was no exception. Everything was very salty and overly oily (yes Hunan food can, apparently, be overly oily). 

For our new dish, we tried the salted fish eggplant hot pot. First of all, it was not in a hot pot, it came on a plate. Anyway, disregarding the false advertisement, this is one of my favourite dishes in general, but this one was only okay. It had no hints of salted fish at all, it just tasted of soy sauce, sugar, and sadness.

The service is a bit slower now, and the rate at which food comes out is comically slow for an Asian restaurant. We waited 25 mins for our first dish, then another 20 for the next one (which was a cold dish that probably should have come out first). And I don't know how long for the rest. We finished our pot of rice, yes I said pot of rice, before our second last dish came out.

Sadly, we probably won't be coming back here anymore. The quality of the food had been declining for a few months, but now you can clearly taste the lack of passion in their food."}
{"text":"Hunan Style restaurant isn't the most creative name, but the food is good, so it doesn't matter. The place is located on a strip plaza that has some pretty underrated food. The restaurant looks tiny on the outside but can hold quite a number of people. The menu is focused on spicier versions of many different dishes.

We ordered pickled chicken feet, deep fried duck, and spicy fish. The chicken feet is done well. I'm not the biggest fan but the girlfriend absolutely loves it. It's cold pickled chicken feet. I'm like chicken feet when its steamed and covered in sauce (for dim sum), but when it's cold and pickled? No Thanks. Move on.

The deep fried duck was the best dish. I go half chubs just thinking about duck. Loved that it was a half duck that was deep fried to where the skin was crisp and the meat was tender. Though a bit dry, the taste was great albeit a bit sweet.

The spicy fish was done OK. The whole fish was smaller than we liked, but the taste was good. It was slightly fishy but overall good with a bit of a burning spice.

The prices are pretty good as is the food. Service was a bit slow, but it was actually expected because there was only 1 or 2 servers managing an entire filled restaurant. That duck dish alone might bring me back though. Loved it."}
{"text":"As someone who can eats just a little bit of spiciness, when I dine at a restaurant that specializes in spicy food, I often order both spicy and non-spicy food to even out the heat.  This was what I did at Hunan Style Restaurant.  We ordered 2 spicy entrées (braised pork and fish in soup) and 2 non-spicy entrees (vegie noodle and stir fry mushroom).  Both of the spicy entrées were noted as 1 chilli level on menu.

The spicy food tasted very good.  My BF and I could handle the spiciness alright.  For reference, the 1 chilli level of spiciness here is as spicy as the \"hot\" wings at St Louis Wings (I trust I have given a benchmark that most people can relate).  The fish was cooked in soup with sour pickled vegetable.  I always like the spicy and sour combination, so I loved the dual flavours of this dish.  The spiciness was mostly in the soup.  The fish fillets were mildly spicy.  My mom drank half the soup (ouch!).  The braised pork was oily (no surprise) and delicious.  This dish can lead to artery clog if you eat it often.  The pork itself was (surprise!) not spicy whatsoever.  The spiciness was in the sauce.  The sauce had layers of flavours.  The sauce would have gone well with white rice.

The non spicy entrées were both bland.  No, not bland when compared to the other dishes.  They were bland/uninteresting on their own.  They needed more salt, more sugar, just more condiments.  The noodle was *flat* in presence.  They seemed way overcooked in water.  I would have preferred a bowl of white rice over it.  The mushroom fared better.  Just add condiment.

So Hunan authentic or not, I love the spicy food here.  The flavours are interesting, and even complex sometimes.  5 stars for the 1-chilli hot food.  No comment for the 2 and 3-chilli hot food.

The non spicy food is below average.  2 stars.

I average it out to 3.5 stars.  I round up to 4 because the spicy food is so good,  And it should not be too difficult to improve the non spicy food.  Just add more condiment and don't over cook things."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Hunan restaurants! My mom is from there so I eat my fair share of spicy food and this place is delicious! 
Recommended dishes: 
????? (traditional delicious Hunan dish!) 
???? (spicy white Chinese yam)
????? (spicy fried chicken pieces) 
????? (dried tofu, pork, spicy green pepper) 

All the above are spicy! They might make your tummy feel funny the next day but they taste is worth it. 

Their egg custard buns ??? are okay too if you're down for something small and sweet after the spicyness. 

Don't ever order their soups though.. Takes forever. 

Also, sorry about my translations... I don't know their actual English names. 

In conclusion, this place is a must go if you're around and love spicy Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I have ever been, I order hot pot fish and theres still scales on it. For the first bite, I ate 3 scales, the service is terrible too. The lady there said if I dont like scales, dont order the dish. This experience was several months ago.
I would give 0 star if I can"}
