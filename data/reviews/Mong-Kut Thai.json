{"text":"Been coming here for the lunch special every Saturday for the past few weeks now. It's usually pretty empty, but the food is tasty and fast, and the owner very friendly. Don't expect anything too fancy, just simple honest food."}
{"text":"Discovered this place walking along the Danforth. Loved the feel of the place. Ordered the MK meat appetizer which was great. And also the Chicken Pad Thai which was ok. Will be returning to try the other yummy items on their menu."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great flavours and better options than the typical Thai restaurants in the city. Very consistent! It's our go-to for delivery as well."}
{"text":"Great spot! Don't be fooled with the mediocre ratings, this is a great Thai restaurant. The food was fantastic, the service was impeccable and it's very well priced too, excellent value for money. And they were super accommodating for my friend who had very specific requests. I will definitely be coming back. Thanks for a great dinner!!"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious! I highly recommend their green curry and they also have amazing lunch specials for a very good price. If you're looking for a great Thai restaurant look no further."}
{"text":"Amazing for a cheap lunch or a nice dinner. The basil chicken is amazing, great fresh rolls. We went for dinner for the first time tonight, it was great. We have gone for lunch a lot, great selections, nice soups and an entre and spring roll for under 10 bucks.

I don't understand why some reviews are so bad, especially for lunch where the prices are 8 to 10 dollars. Soup, main and spring roll for under 10 bucks. Amazing value for the area."}
{"text":"Better than Friendly Thai, not as good as Khao San Road (but then, what is?).

For east end delivery, I'll order them again. The shrimp fresh rolls were generous (although needing more dipping sauce), and the mixed pad thai ok -- while nary a tomato in sight, it could use with more chicken, shrimp and egg than it arrived with. I forgot to ask them to make it spicy, so a healthy dosing of sriracha was required.

Delivery took about an hour at 7pm on Friday night; I was under the $20 min order so paid $3 extra for delivery, next time will grab the shrimp chips ($3.95) to push me over the minimum."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty picky eater when it comes to restaurants, especially thai restaurants. Having many food restrictions there's not much I can have at most places, but Mong Kut has a really great selection for vegans and vegetarians. The vegetable pad thai is the best I've had yet. I tried pad thai at at least 5 others places and it was always disappointing, but not this one! 

The food is always hot and fresh, and service is decent. Whenever I want thai food, I know this is the place to go. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We really loved our visit there on Sunday evening. We were hungry and wanted to try something different. Their menu offers a great variety of interesting options to choose from. Many gluten-free options as well. 

We were quickly seated to a nice booth. One thing though, there was something blowing lots of cool air to our toes, so therefore we were freezing and couldn't take the jackets off. 

We had Pad Woon Sen with shrimps and a Salmon in Panang Sauce. We loved the food, all was very tasty. I was so amazed by the Pad Woon Sen, would order that any other time. We wanted the fish to be grilled or baked, but it was deep-fried, therefore not completely. 

Service was good and fast by the server, who kept out glasses full of water. Food came pretty fast.

Definitely a place where would love to go back again."}
{"text":"It was getting late at night, our stomachs were rumbling, we wanted to try something different along the Danforth...

My friend ordered the Tom Kha Gai, and I had the Vermicelli with Golden Curry.
Both were...leaving us wanting a heck lot of something else.

The Tom Kha Gai had little-to-no chicken and was wayyyyyyyyy to limey.
The Vermicelli with Golden Curry was really oily, generally tasteless and the vegetables were basically raw.

Restaurant size:
Being along the Danforth, the restaurant is an OK size! However, the heating grills in the middle of the table take up serious feet real estate. As a person with long legs, I had a few new bruises that night...and I didn't even have fun.

Portion size:
You get a decent amount of bland disappointment. 

Service:
The restaurant was really, really, quiet on a Friday night...but that didn't stop the staff from being nearly non-existent until it was time to pay."}
{"text":"Excellent flavourful food a step above most others! It is our local go to and beats the over priced underwhelming neighbours"}
{"text":"I've been here once, but it was actually quite good.  Surprisingly good, for what I had ordered and expected.  Perhaps that's because I am a vegetarian, but the meal was much appreciated.  My friend liked his meat dish as well.

Service was great, the space was clean, and it was an excellent place to go on Danforth if you didn't want Greek or burgers.  It is definitely in the middle ground between the fast food places and the fine dining, so in that, I think it serves a great function on the street."}
{"text":"I only tried one dish (spicy fried rice) and it was enough to convince me to never return, especially considering Sukhothai is only 5 minutes away. Poor value - in fact I could have done better on my own.

If you've only ever eaten at Thai Express in malls, then it's not very different."}
{"text":"I know gas prices are soaring. If only we could use excess cooking oil to run our cars. If that were the case, mong-kut's food would fuel a trip from Toronto to Bangkok. Geez, man! The spring rolls were still dripping with oil. I decided to go for something different than the standard pad thai. Adventurous, that's me. I like living on the edge, y'know? So I tried the chu cha noodles (vegetable).  They're yellow noodles in a thai garlic sauce. No easing up on the oil here either. The noodles tasted like cheap udon noodles that were rehydrated in oily water. My husband ordered the pad thai and was treated to some eggshells in his dish. 
I had to pour on the sriacha sauce. Still bland so I had to add some garlic red chili sauce. This dish seemed resistant to taste.
I think I'm going to retreat into a shell and tone down that \"hey, let's try something different for dinner tonight!\" for awhile."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I can say it's definitely decent thai food, probably one of the better places you'll find in the danforth area. The service is quick because usually it's pretty empty and the food is pretty standard thai although you can get similar quality food at other places. Could definitely be more flavorful and have more meat in their meat dishes. They have a huge menu and tons of meal options so that's great and have marked which are gluten free which is kind of a nice little touch since the friend I went with the first time is GF.

Overall, it's not a bad place to go every once in a while if you're looking for some quick, pretty tasty thai food for an average price."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Thai restaurant on the Danforth, in my opinion. The back page of their menu has a couple great unique dishes on it (I recommend the first dish listed -don't remember what it's called - and the Kai Yad Sai (sp?)), and you can't go wrong with their Tom yum soup, cold spring rolls, and spicy Thai fried rice. What I love about the place is that if you ask them to make a dish spicy for you, they actually will! (coming from a person who can handle a lot of spice). So yay!  

The service is friendly and fast for the most part.

They have an amazing dessert, deep fried coconut ice cream, but it hasn't been available lately :(. A million sadnesses.

The only bad food experience I had was with their hot and sour soup - had a strange and bland taste, but it could have just been an off night. Their Tom yum and coconut soups more than make up for that one though.

Also, place has a good number of booths and nice decor. Makes a great date night dinner."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight at Mong-Kut Thai was delicious, hot and fresh.  While portions were generous, ingredients were a little skimpy in some dishes.  Wonton soup had tasty wontons but there were only a few small ones in the bowl, and fresh rolls with shrimp had very little shrimp.  Cashew shrimp, on the other hand, had lots of plump tasty shrimp.  The room is nicely decorated and comfortable.  Worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Extraordinary Thai food! The mango salad is fresh and a great compliment to the savory satays and noodle dishes. The portions are gigantic and the prices are reasonable. There is an option to grill your own food, like in a Korean Grill House, but I've never seen anyone do it and I've yet to do it myself. Friendly service and a casual environment combine to make this one of my favorite restaurants in the city, and among my favorite Thai restaurants east of Yonge."}
{"text":"My favourite spot for Thai food - love their fresh spring rolls, spicy fried rice, and deep-fried coconut ice-cream (when it's available). The 'traditional' dishes on the last page of the menu are also a highlight - especially the Khai Yad Sai (I am probably butchering the spelling of that one) - seasoned pork wrapped in egg."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! Used to go every weekend or whenever I felt like eating out. But this place has lost their passion! Doesn't taste the same and they gave me the wrong order when I ordered from them too"}
{"text":"My hunny took us here last night for Vday dinner. Delicious fresh mango salad. Tasty Tom Ka soup. I had the Chu Cha with beef - great! My guy had the broccoli and beef - tasty sauce.
The service was excellent. We're not drinking so they kept filling our water glasses without being asked.
Comfortable booths. Good value for the money.
I'd return!"}
{"text":"Good take out veggie Pad Thai! Friendly, fast service and the price was right! I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here with my aunt for lunch, very small portions and the Tom khan soup tasted like water. I told the server and all she did was take the soup away. The food is lacking flavour and the staff seem to be lacking interest. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Was looking for Thai nearby with a friend and thought we would try this place despite only 3 stars. I don't understand the low rating - it was amazing. The service was great and we were both more than happy and plan to go back. I had the cashew nut chicken and my friend had yellow curry chicken and we sampled each others dishes and were glad all around. We were here on a Sunday kind of late and noone else was around"}
{"text":"Not too many Thai places on the Danforth.  I've seen a few come and go in the last few years - not an easy place to make money with Thai food.  Mong-Kut thai is your average Thai restaurant with all the average staples.  I was there around lunch time and their lunch menu is very decently priced, but most dishes are veggies and chicken is $4 extra.  Not a big deal.  The flavor is OK, pretty standard, not bad, but nothing to get foaming about.  Good bet for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"TLDR version: Better tasting Thai eateries for the same $$, unmemorable food. 

The décor reminds you of run off the mill Korean BBQ places and the tables have the grills intact. Unsure what the history of the place was. 

We ordered spring rolls for appetizers which wasn't really fresh tasting. We left it alone and moved on to the entrées which arrived within a few minutes. 

Penang Kai which is a thick peanut and coconut curry with chicken breast leaves very little to the imagination of how it was prepared. My best guess for this receipt was 1 can Coconut milk, 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter, some Thai sweet chilli sauce, lime juice and 2 mins in a Vitamix, heat, toss chicken breast slices .. and Viola = Penang Kai. Really SAD

The golden curry powder fried rice with chicken and shrimp was also .. meh !

The service was friendly, water was filled promptly earns them one extra star. We declined the offer to look at the dessert menu, and the meal left us still hungry. Luckily.. there is a Popeyes just a stone's throw away."}
{"text":"I like that the lunch specials are served until 4pm and are available on the weekend.  However, the spring roll served with the lunch special was pretty bland.

My go-to dinner dish is the Kra Poa Khai Doa, the first item from the homestyle Thai section on the last page of the menu. The ground meat is full of flavour and I definitely recommend it, especially if you like garlic.

I did not care for the green curry, as the flavours were not balanced and lacking in depth.  It was too sweet for my liking and overly rich, which could have easily been addressed with the addition of fresh citrus and/or (more) galangal.

They do not seem to be able to handle more than a couple of tables.  Once when we had been waiting more than 20 minutes for our dinner, we were told that the delay was due to them having only have one wok (there were only 2 other tables of 2!)

Of the 3 times I have visited, I have did not see anyone using the table grills; I don't recall seeing it as an option on the menu and they just take away leg room :(

The service is indifferent, but not unpleasant.  The dining room and bathrooms are clean and there is a small sidewalk patio.  2.5 stars = very average, cannot recommend without caveats."}
{"text":"The owner is rude and pretentious. Won't ever eat there, don't care what the food tastes like because if you can't get customer service right and be polite to people, I can't imagine you're going to do much better cooking a meal for me."}
{"text":"The worst thai food I have had in the city. They really set the bar low. The panang noodles tasted like crunchy peanut butter was mixed into it. The noodles were still in the shape of the packaging and clumped together. The coconut soup was so sour. 



I have rated this restaurant a generous one star. 

I am a foodie. I love my food. I walked into this place without reading reviews before hand and regret it. It looks nice in terms of decor and the outter detailing of the menu was impressive. But the experience ends there."}
{"text":"Came to have lunch here a few days ago and got combo #1 from their lunch special menu. 

It was beef with rice + soup 
The food was alright. Very small portions for the price.. 

However I enjoyed my meal and my company of course! The store was empty.. We were the only ones there, and it was dead. 

Give it a try If you're thinking of it... But if you don't it's ok you're not missing out on anything crazy. I might come back in the future to try the actual menu"}
{"text":"The chicken satay is too flavorful for children but the rice is very good. 
We had cashew nut chicken and mango chicken. Both were very good. Service was slow but the food was fresh, hot and Delicious. Not for children."}
