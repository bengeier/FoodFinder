{"text":"For someone like myself who hasn't plugged in her TV for six months, Jilly's is a great place to go for a little television fix. Although one time there wasn't sound, the televisions are great for dinner discussions or for instant distractions when you don't feel like talking  I think the food is fantastic as well, especially the wings. And rounding everything off, the wait staff is very relaxed and friendly."}
{"text":"fun place to hang out for drink on friday and sat nights."}
{"text":"Yawn.  I find this place leaves a \"blah\" memory in my mind  It's kinda like Half Moon, but with more of a... trashy vibe.  So yeah.  Decent happy hour specials.  Decent-ish bar food.  Eh."}
{"text":"This place has twoareas to it, the bar/restaurant plus outdoor seating and the dance club.  The dance club is all right, booths line the walls around a small dance floor.  The bar/restaurant can get packed.  The food is better than average, and the drinks are good.  Good mix of people there on dates, and others looking to hook up."}
{"text":"I think my family likes the atmosphere here more than the food, but that's OK. Even though there are always plenty of singles and couples here, the relaxed, friendly atmosphere also works perfectly for families. Get a booth if you can and enjoy your own personal TV complete w/remote control! (If you can wrestle it from your partner, that is). Want more reasons to visit? T1 connection for laptops, outdoor seating, and pool tables and shuffleboards."}
{"text":"It has gone down hill over the years. :(  Used to be the only thing in North Scottsdale and now it's out shadowed by Fox Sports Grill and all the other great stuff at Kierland and the Promenade.    Food used to be great, now it's what I would call okay.  Service is a lot less friendly that what it used to be.    They have pool, golden tee, shuffle board, and TVs everywhere."}
{"text":"This place is situated perfectly near the Scottsdale Airpark and all the fun stuff by Kierland Commons.  It maintains an upscale Scottsdale feeling without ever feeling stuffy.    The food is pretty darn good - which worked great for me as I used to work in the area and we'd often take over a section of the place on a semi-regular basis.  And they never complained when we did - though it could be because they knew we were good tippers.    Upscale enough to go in work clothes with work folks, but casual enugh to go in shorts on the weekend."}
