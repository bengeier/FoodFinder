{"text":"The best breakfast I've ever had. The flavor was incredible and of course, the service was AMAZING. The owner, Chris Faddis, was kind enough to check in our visit and made sure everything was perfect. My wife and children loved the food as well. Just an incredible experience!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! The food is fantastic....delicious, healthy, and inexpensive. I had the barbecue pork chop salad with a side of sweet potatoes and a creamsicle iced tea! Loved that I got back to work feeling energized/not tired for the rest of my day. Easy to find just west of the 101. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite new place in town! Had a fun breakfast with coworkers. Everything was absolutely delicious and the staff were so courteous!! Such a great experience"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! It's in the College of Naturopathic Medicine so everything is fresh and tastes great! They make up their own teas so you have options that include Study Buddy (has peppermint to promote focus) and the seasonal option is Snickerdoodle. I got the breakfast sandwich which included egg, cheese, and chicken sausage on a brioche bun; it even comes with a salad on the side. As if all of that wasn't enough to make your mouth water, they make scones fresh every day. 

All in all this place has great food, friendly workers, and is well worth the price that you pay. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the perfect match to the SCNM but it is also open to the public in the area. Their breakfast offerings are delicious, along with their teas blended by an herbalist and coffee. I tried their avo toast made with Noble bread, cracked salt and pepper and a hint of citrus oil and it was perfection. I also tried their frittata du jour, their cocoa chai and coffee and everything was delightful and flavorful. I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Their avocado toast is my favorite and I love their sweet potatoes! Everyone here is always so nice and sweet. I believe it closes at 3pm every day though!"}
{"text":"Excellent food that is priced well. I love the avocado toast with a fried egg on top!! Sooooo gooood!"}
{"text":"Saw the good rating and stopped by. WELL WORTH IT! Fantastic, fantastic food. 

Can not recommend it enough"}
{"text":"This place has fresh tasting, healthy, affordable food and I will definitely be back! Can't wait to try lunch!"}
{"text":"Staff was extremely nice and attentive. Ordered the cilantro chicken in a sandwich. The chipotle aioli was very flavorful and spicy and totally made the sandwich! Super fast service and great food."}
{"text":"The Bene Plates Cafe opened it's doors to the public today, filling the vacancy left by Nourish at The Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine (SCNM). The story behind this spot is that the owner's late wife had stage four cancer and his goal was to keep her nourished and fed, but due to her symptoms she could not eat much. The food at the hospital was terrible and he decided to come up with fresh, easy meals, that were packed with nutrition. His goal was to have a deliverable meal service for patients and individuals who are need healthy food and cannot cook on their own. He made it all happen and this is where the recipes and concepts behind Bene Plates Cafe originated. This is their new brick and mortar location, we they will offer their food to the public and will also hopefully help some of the patients at SCNM with meals and meal prep.

The food so far, seems fresh and vibrant, packed with flavor and nutrition, without unnecessary additives and other crap. I had the chorizo breakfast burrito and it was definitely a good choice, although I would have loved a bit more of the avocado salsa (those pesky drug cartels and their avocado price fixing!) The coffee is fantastic, the beans are from local Chandler, AZ roaster Peixoto Coffee. I recommend the straight black drip. 

The service was good, especially considering this is their first day open, and they were fairly busy during the lunch rush. The prices were competitive with other local healthy options. Overall, I would recommend that you come check this place out and see what you think. It is a welcome addition to this area, even if you only want a nice cup coffee!"}
{"text":"When I'm running late for work or haven't packed a lunch, Bene Plates Cafe has quickly become my go-to place to grab healthy, affordable food. Chris, the owner, often greets you from behind the counter to take your order. There seems to be a steady crowd of students, faculty and staff from SCNM which is always a good sign. And Bene supports local by serving favorites such as Nobel Bread, Rad Pressed Juices and Peixoto Coffee. The food is fantastic and I have yet to find a single meal or tea that wasn't delicious (and I've tried a few). What a great hidden gem! I urge you to visit and support this wonderful, new, local business!"}
{"text":"Really happy my friends and I discovered this gem. Best chorizo breakfast burro I've ever had with the last bite being the best. This place is trouble for its competitors! Excited to explore the menu in the future and will be back a few times a week."}
{"text":"Really excellent food, friendly staff, and the prices are extremely reasonable! This is not \"fast food.\" Easy to find, plenty of parking, large dining room. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Lots of vegan/vegetarian options...can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. One of my faves is the vegan hash skillet and the creamsicle tea is good as well..

Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have tried two different types of porridge here and both were awesome.  I'm from out of town otherwise I'd be eating here on a regular basis.  The service was really good too."}
{"text":"Ordered the chorizo burrito after hearing from everyone this place was amazing. No one else was in line before me and it still took them 30 minutes to make. It wasn't rolled correctly and it was bland. How was chorizo bland??? I ordered it \"for here\" to not waste plastic and got it in a plastic to go box.
1 Star for warm 1 Star for edible."}
{"text":"Awesome smashed avacado toast with an egg over easy. Delicious!!!! Tea of the day was creamsicle. I had it ice, yum!!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! I was not only impressed with the food but with the service and prices as well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for a late breakfast/early lunch today and honestly I was entirely unprepared for how great this place is.

First off, I had a little bit of a problem finding it (I was meeting some friends there) because it's a very unassuming little spot at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine. You'd be forgiven for not ever even knowing that it existed, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice by never going there. 

I ordered the almond-butter/killer bee honey toast, and the pork shoulder something-or-other. I was honestly not expecting for the food to be as good as it was. I ordered the toast because of the cool-sounding name and it was just absolutely delicious. One slice of good bread, toasted, with a big ol' spread of almond butter and a nice drizzle of honey. You can really taste the subtle killer bee nuances (I kid, I kid). The pork shoulder was pulled over roasted sweet potatoes with a perfect egg on top of it, and it knocked my socks off. The portion sizes were just right- not small enough to leave you hungry, but not so big that you feel guilty about not eating it all but don't have enough left over to take home, if that makes sense?

The service at the counter was very friendly- everyone who was working was very engaging, personable, and helpful. I can't recommend this place enough, and I'm really looking forward to bringing my girlfriend here."}
{"text":"I have come here twice in two weeks already and plan to make this a regular breakfast spot on my way into Phoenix. The food is so fresh, healthy, and just plain delicious. It is nice to find a place that is so welcoming and serves amazing food. I would definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Bene Plates twice this week. I don't have any pictures to share though because I've gobbled everything right up! Seriously delicious food. So far I have tried the Meatloaf Burger, the Machaca Burro, and the soup de jour (chicken tortilla). It's honestly hard to say which was my favorite because they were each so uniquely delicious and different. I really look forward to trying the rest of the menu as everything has been so tasty. The portions are filling but not enormous. I would definitely say it's a good deal though; if you were to go overboard and get sides and a drink it should still be shy of $15. 

Since Bene Plates is located inside of a medical school, parking can be a little tricky but there are usually spots right outside of the cafe. Just look for a spot marked visitor. Maybe I'll see you there!"}
{"text":"What a great find! I have been searching for more healthy options close to work so this place is perfect for me. The portions are especially generous for the price, especially considering everything is prepared fresh to order. My favorite is the barbecue pork salad; it is fresh, flavorful and filling.  I plan on coming here at least 1 to 2 times per week so I will try everything on the menu."}
