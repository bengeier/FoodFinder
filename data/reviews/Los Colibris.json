{"text":"Ryan's review (age 10): I feel like this place is a mix between fancy and casual. The appetizers are all good and the desserts are not bad. But, the main courses are not the best. If you are going to get the \"Picaditas de Pulpo\" I do not recommend it. Well, on the website it shows the dish different than it is in the restaurant, and just to make things worse, the dish is drenched in sauce. The service is ok, and the food is not great. I would not recommend it.  The mom review:  upscale Mexican food in a trendy, but relaxed setting.  We ordered the guacamole, which was excellent and unique with the pomegranate seeds and taro root chips, to start.  Then we got the queso fundido, requested by the kid.  It was tasty, but greasy.  We were brought corn tortillas, and when we requested flour tortillas instead, as we were not asked which kind we wanted, we were charged for them.  Entrees were decent,  but the octopus was nothing like the picture online.  We based the kid's order on this, and he was disappointed in the result.  Adult meals were fine--we ordered the empanadas and Jardin de Wookiee (vegetarian).  Dessert was decent, coffee was great, but my wine order was wrong as the server got my order and the husband's order mixed up.  He seemed bothered by our presence and annoyed at having to serve us.  Lasting impression: I agree with the kid--good, not great, and I don't need to return."}
{"text":"If you appreciate fine Mexican food, you will LOVE this restaurant!! From the moment we entered the restaurant we knew were going to have an amazing experience. This high class restaurant boasts classy décor with a little touch of Mexico; ask for one of the cozy booths! We couldn't decide, so we ordered pretty much everything on the menu and shared it all, family style!! Everything was delicious but our particular favourites were - Queso Fundido (melted cheese and chorizo sausage...need I say more??), definitely try the Empandas, the Tijuana Caesar and the Chipotle Arrachera con Frijoles ... so tasty!!! Next time you are craving Mexican, or if you have yet to experience fine Mexican food, run..don't walk... to Los Colibris!!"}
{"text":"Wer mexikanische gehobene Küche sucht ist hier genau richtig! Sehr delikate Speisen, super Bedienung, Preise eher hoch, aber gerechtfertigt. Schöne Einrichtung. Hat uns sehr gut gefallen"}
{"text":"I was here with my husband for the weekday Summerlicious lunch - definitely a good a value.   Ambiance was great: clean, enjoyable and comfortable. We had chicken pozole, carnitas, enchilladas de poblano, churros and ice cream - for $23 (per person) you get an appetizer, entre and a dessert.   The chicken pozole was good. It was spicy but not overly where you can't taste anything else. I enjoyed that you can distinctly taste each ingredients in the soup. My husband had the carnitas which he described as pulled-pork with a Mexican taste.  I had the echilladas which I prefer than his carnitas. Again, I enjoyed that I can taste individual flavours in my dish.  Perhaps, what I liked the least was the dessert - to me they were just ok.  I had mango sorbet that tasted like fresh mangos, really tangy - which is good, but I'm not really a fan of fruity/tangy sorbet. The chocolate ice cream tasted just like regular chocolate ice cream (nothing special).  Overall, the Summerlicious lunch menu is a good value, and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday in June. I ordered the chicken empanadas to start and the Chipotle Arrachera con Frijoles.  Both were pretty tasty and I would recommend them.  The steak dish is a little heavy for a warm summer evening and I found myself wishing it came with a fresh tomato salsa.  My companion ordered the fish of the day, it was okay, but neither or us were wild about the flavour profile.  For desert I ordered the selection of 3 ice creams, choosing soursop, dulce de leche, and spicy chocolate.  My companion ordered the selection of selection of biscuits which were incredible lovely to look at but she had no room for and ended up taking most to go.  We both thought that the ice creams had nice flavours but were overly sweet.  The few cookies we tried were also a little too sweet.  The thing that I was most put off by during our experience was a how the smoky the seating area was from things being burned in the kitchen.  The open kitchen is supposed to be a design feature that creates interest but I found it meant a less pleasant dining experience.     The was service good and friendly.  The food was pretty good but not so outstanding that I would feel the need to come back."}
{"text":"This is the place for high-end Mexican fare downtown, with a formal vibe. The food and service were impeccable, not to mention all the great tequila-based cocktails."}
{"text":"Los Colibris has become our new favourite place to grab a drink and early dinner before the theatre. Compared to the bland, played-out offerings from the incumbents on (the south side of) King West, this place really is a rose among thorns.   Inventive and contemporary without ignoring the authenticity of its Mexican roots, the quality of the cuisine cannot be overstated: from the freshness of the ingredients to the well balanced flavours and modern presentation, all of the dishes we ordered were exciting and memorable.    Service is friendly and fast, and the bar makes superb cocktails (Mexican and other... but the margarita really is exquisite) and has an excellent selection of hard-to-find tequilas.  Whether coming for a pre-theatre drink or snack or a full course dinner, Los Colibris doesn't disappoint - it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"I visited Los Colibris yesterday evening for dinner with a small group. It was a magical experience and I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a fancy dinner and amazing food.  This space is very modern and elegant but at the same time has a very relaxed and comfortable vibe. The set up is very inviting, there is a place in the front for an intimate dinner or drinks and further back is an array of booths and tables to fit larger groups.  Our server was extremely friendly, knowledgable and efficient. I did not catch his name but he really made ever effort to make us feel comfortable. He suggested a few dishes and we ordered Ceviche Blancho $13,Queso Fundido $15, Raja Poblanas $16 and Empanadas for appetizers  and Huachinango a la Veracruzana $24,Cero en Mancha Mantel $24, Chipotle Arrachera con frijoles $26  and a lamb dish.  Every single dish that came out of that kitchen was beautifully prepared and tasted wonderful. I was really impressed with how perfectly the meat was cooked and how all of the flavours complimented each other. The meat was tender, infused with flavour and of high quality. I can honestly say this was probably the best meal I have ever had. The one dish that I could eat for the rest of my life was the Queso Fundido. It was hot, cheesy with chorizo sausage. It was simple yet addictive. Our table devoured this dish within 5 minutes!! I had to stop myself from ordering another one. I cannot express how amazing this was, it is something you need to experience for yourself.    Overall our meal was excellent and we will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted a drink after work so we dropped by El Caballito first but it was way too dark in there so we decided to check out Los Colibris upstairs instead. I was little hesitant at first because it seemed little too fancy for a weeknight hangout, so we decided to just hang out by the bar but I'm really glad we went. We were greeted and served by really, really friendly staff and after one drink (I had Zona Rosa after recommendation from staff - strong and delicious!), we ended up staying for Mexican beer, guac/chips and dinner. This one bartender in particular was so kind and helpful, giving us suggestions on what to order and explaining where their tequila's from and where the chef got her recipes, etc.   Guac: little pricy for portion size but the flavour was great. They refill the house-made chips.. I loved the taro chips, I could buy a whole bag of that.  Rajas Poblanas: creamy chicken/corn dish that could've been heavy but it wasn't because of nice blend of poblano pepper and onions. The plate of house-made corn tortilla isn't enough for the plate so you have to order at least another plate. It's so worth it!  Empanadas: Comes in a plate of three, with pulled pork inside. This was really nice and crunch, but not too oily or doughy.  It was just such a pleasant dining experience that we look forward to going back and try different drinks and food items."}
{"text":"Made plans to meet a friend for dinner and this was where we ended up. Nice decor but the food was lacking in presentation and oomph. We shared the Yelp Check In special which tasted better than it looked (gloppy white sauce with slices of peppers, chicken and cheese). The traditional ceviche was okay but small for the price and lacking in depth of flavour. I got the house special stuffed pepper which was a surprisingly sweet. While interesting, I don't think I would order it again. All in all, my dinner with 2 beers came to over $50+tip. Could be they had an off night or I didn't order the right dishes; regardless, I won't be hurrying back."}
{"text":"This has been a wonderful addition to the King Street strip - Chef Elia does amazing WORK given the geographical constraints where one is usually forced to conform to make food for older theatre goers who have little tolerance for interesting flavours.  Chef Elia rocks - (to management) please make sure that she keeps up her amazing work.  Of the front of the house staff, Hanna as the roving boss is amazingly hospitable, as are her staff including but not limited to Edder, Raaj, Brent, Kaylie (off the wooden eyeglass fame) - GO and make sure you have a cocktail or two."}
{"text":"Writing this review is a bit of an internal struggle. I dined here for winterlicious based on previous reviews and the fact that it was rated one of the top 10 restaurants in Toronto on Trip Advisor. I must say, it did not live up to any expectations.   This restaurant is in a great central location with tons of street parking nearby as well as a few parking lots. The restaurant itself is classy and beautiful. We were greeted several times by multiple servers upon being seated and it was very welcoming. This restaurant has no issues when it comes to service overall, everyone was attentive (re folded napkins whenever someone left the table to use the restrooms), polite and seemed to genuinely enjoy working there. The food itself seems to be where the restaurant is lacking..   Firstly the drinks are incredibly overpriced and quality wise they are just mediocre. For $12 a drink, I was expecting something better than average but it was pretty much just a basic margarita with a stick of rosemary as garnish. Not horrible, but I definitely didn't want another.   Fair warning, all portions of food were incredibly small and everyone at the table left feeling like they could still eat another course. As for food to start our table had the jicama salad, pulled pork soup and empanadas de tinga. The salad was again, basic. The flavours were balanced but it was nothing special and something I could probably make quite easily at home. The empanadas were good but again were nothing extraordinary flavour wise. The soup was probably the tastiest of the bunch but was also quite oily. Once it was finished there was a rim of oil residue left on the bowl. Kind of unsettling. For mains we had the ropa vieja and the tlantonile. The brisket was good and full of flavour, and there weren't any complaints about the dish besides how small of a portion it was for an entree. The tlantonile was also good but poblano croquettes were lacking flavour and without the veggies and sauce to accommodate them they would have been relatively bland. Also again, portion was incredibly tiny and felt like an appetizer. Finally for dessert we had the ice cream duo and dulce de leche cake which wasn't on the main menu. The ice cream was probably the best part of the entire meal. They were both rich, creamy, perfectly sweet and so indulgent. The dulce de leche cake was very boring. Probably I the lowest point of the meal.   So all in all, I really wanted to love this place. After reading so many positive reviews I admit I had high hopes for it. However I found it to be incredibly underwhelming. Nothing was overly innovative, portions were small and to be quite honest I've had better Mexican at some hole in the wall restaurants. This place gets a solid 5 for service, but only a 3 - 3.5 for food."}
{"text":"Note: I did not go to this restaurant as I couldn't determine the accessibility situation. For others looking for that info, here it is, quoted directly from staff:  \"Unfortunately the restaurant is not wheelchair accessible. The washrooms are on the main floor, but the entrance to the restaurant itself is elevated a few steps up from street level.\"  I find it annoying that many restaurants on yelp have no comment on wheelchair access when they are not accessible but appreciate in this case that I got a response. In general, it is far more convenient to know, either way, when trying to plan an outing, than to have to eliminate a bunch of options due to uncertainty. For some people, the bit of information above is enough for them to decide they can manage it, and the restaurant is missing out on serving those customers too. I received the response the day after my planned outing, so at that point it's too late. I went somewhere else but this menu looks great."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Mexican food, but more upscale than a standard taqueria, which aren't that great to begin with in Toronto.  I stumbled across Los Colibris in my Yelp results and decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did:  It was one of the better meals I've had in Toronto.    Los Colibris takes traditional Mexican dishes and adds an element of sophistication and subtly to them.  I had the traditional ceviche, which was marinated in just the right amount of lime juice (most restaurants tend to make it too citrusy).  It had a bit of heat to offset the slight acidity of the lime and tomatoes.  For my main, I went with the chiles en Nogada.  The pork was cooked just right while it had a perfect balance of a subtle sweetness with the savory, nutty undertones.  The ingredients in both dishes were fresh while the food had great presentation.  And even though I didn't drink, the tequila list was quite comprehensive and impressive.  The bartender knew quite a bit about the varieties and tastes of tequila and mescal.  The ambience at Los Colibris was upscale and modern, although it wasn't particularly lively or boisterous.  There was a good mix between suits and those on dates.  I could see Los Calibris being a good destination for date night at one of the tables at the back:  the lighting is dim, white table clothes, and a number of 2-seater tables.  And I can't speak enough about the great service:  Meals were delivered efficiently yet paced correctly.  I sat at the bar and the bartender told me all about tequila, traditional Mexican food, and Mexico City.  If I had to ding Los Colibris on anything, it was the lack of off-menu specials.  That would have added another unique dimension to their plates.  Overall I'd give Los Colibris 4.5 stars (if Yelp allowed for a half point).  Judging by my meal and the service, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent food, reasonable wine prices and excellent bar & table service. The only improvement is the hostess greeting. Highly recommend the duck plate for 2."}
{"text":"Amazing meal that was authentic. If you want to eat close to the theatre make sure you get a table here, the rest of the king st row will disappoint you."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin, this place is simply AMAZING, it is without a doubt the best fine Mexican cuisine ever in my life. The staff is so friendly and helpful from the moment you step in. If you are ever in Toronto this place is a must."}
{"text":"Ambiance great! Loved the little lounge area where you can socialize and have a drink while waiting for the rest of your group or for your table. Location in the heart of being entertained Sebastian was our server and he was excellent. He was polite and entertaining and he had great recommendations.  We would have loved to be able to order and eat everything but alas we did not bring a spare stomach.  We shared the aps and had our own entrees.  The aps we had did not disappoint, they were delicious! Ceviche tamarind, rajas poblanas, guarache de pulpo en su tints, el golondrino.  I had the Chipotle arrachera con frijoles which was also good.  Leave room for dessert!  The tres leches is very well done. There was an issue with our cocktails but it was promptly attended to which is a sign of great customer service. I would recommend this restaurant and would go back."}
{"text":"Being Mexican, I wanted to try and like this place. I gave it three shots and am still disappointed.  The first time, I had to wait over an hour to be seated, even though I had a reservation. Once we got to our table, they didn't even offer all the dishes on the menu. Needless to say, we decided to leave and go elsewhere.  Second time was at Taste of Toronto. We ordered a tostada, and it seemed like we weren't the only ones that were disappointed. Even though a few people complained the restaurant told them they were wrong and it was supposed to taste like that since the beans were smoked with avocado leaves. Instead of accepting their mistake, they stood their ground and stood behind their disappointing food.  The last chance was at the restaurant again. The food this time was actually pretty good, but the service was very condescending. I wasn't a fan of being told what I ordered in broken Spanish.  I'm all for Mexican fine dining, but it's a shame I didn't enjoy my experience at this restaurant. I would say it's overrated, and you could do much better for the price."}
{"text":"4/5! I highly recommend this place for large groups (ask for the private dining area). For starters I recommend sharing the Ceviche Blanco, Ceviche Tamarindo and Ceviche Tradicional. Ofc - you must also order the Guacamole for the table. As for mains, the Mixiote de Cordero (braised lamb shank) and Chilies en Nogada (stuffed pepper) were a huge hit. All the desserts were remarkable but if I had to pick two: Flan de Chocolate and Tres Leches. The only downer if that it is overpriced for Mexican given its competition in Toronto. But if you want a nice night out before a show; I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered through Uber Eats so this review is for food only. I had the rajas poblana which is like a chicken stew. The rajas is pretty good with lots of chicken in it. It is very salty though. I'm also disappointed with the cheap Old El Passover flour tortillas. Based on the food alone I don't think I'll bother with the restaurant"}
{"text":"Came here twice. First time last October and second time just last night. My boyfriend and I both absolutely LOVE this place.  Service, setting, and food. Most of the time a restaurant may lack one of those three. But this place has it all. Everything is just so up to par and we will definitely come back on another special night, despite the prices. Keep doing what you're doing, Los Colibris!"}
{"text":"Update: Took a star off since returning. The second time was a disaster. Our reservation somehow got lost. Secondly, the hostess was extremely rude and disrespectful. Food was still great but the hostess was the worse.   Summerlious menu. 3.5/5 It was a nice evening intro to the restaurant. It's upscale and sophisticated with not much showing of its Mexican roots.  However, the food speaks louder. The highlights included the Col Rizada with Panela Cheese a la Plancha, included a nice smoky grill cheese enhanced with a salad of tangy dressing and hit of ginger. Unfortunately, Cod Agua-chile was slightly bland, and I would of like the lime and heat level up.   Main of Pollo a la Plancha con Creamy Poblano, included aromatic vibrant green sauce and sweet corns, tender chicken. Simple preparation of vegs, it was well balanced and portioned. Pescado en Salsa Verde came with a strong spiced sauce and rice that added lots of flavour to the fish. Some may find the seasoning overwhelming after a few bites.   Dessert were descent but nothing wow, since they were prepared like samplier.   Overall, good and would come back. Service was on par."}
{"text":"Hate to be negative but very surprised this place has such great reviews. The interior is modern, slick and nice - the service attentive BUT that is not really what I would rate a restaurant on. Every single course we had was extremely bland and borderline flavourless. It is not to be unexpected in this area - aka tourist central. Would have preferred to go downstairs and had some sloppy tacos that actually had some taste and bite to them. This would be a good place to bring friends from Wisconsin that prefer meat and potatoes but want a 'cultural' experience."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was not only delicious, but unique. Who knew that Mexican cuisine this good could be found in Toronto, not Santa Fe? The staff was helpful, friendly, and based on their advice - spot on. The octopus is better than steak."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised 1) they let me make a reservation on a Saturday night for a group of 16 with short notice 2) the food was really good. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal (the steak was awesome!) 3) the waiters were attentive but didn't get in the way. All out orders came out at the same time and were nice and hot 4) drinks were delicious too  I am definitely going to be a regular customer here"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night for a double birthday, group of 7.  When we arrived I didn't find the hostess particularly friendly.  When the waitress came to the table I didn't find her particularly friendly either and as the night progressed she was clearly a ......  Our group was not obnoxious or rude, we were laughing loud and enjoying each other's company, nothing out of the ordinary.  Food was not stellar but really good.  But because of the service, I will not go back.  Oh yes, the bathrooms were not impressive and incredibly dirty."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the tapas at this place! We actually ended up getting 5 tapas to share between two people instead of any main courses. The queso fundido, camarones, AND salmon ceviche were incredible!! Also got the empenadas and guac/chips (the usual) which were also good (but not as great as the others). The tres leches cake and dulce/horchata ice cream were equally as amazing, as were the unique cocktails! Would def recommend!"}
{"text":"Ambiance- 4 stars.  The place looks cool, and definitely mexican.    Arched ceilings, wood beams, white stucco walls.   Service- 2 stars.  three times we were asked \"do you want water?\"  Each time we said yes, but nobody brought us any.  Bit of a tease that.  The people working there were friendly enough, but not exactly skilled.  Oh, and when we left, the coat check had been abandoned, and there was a group of about 15 customers at the front waiting for their coats.  One lady in her 60's said \"to hell with this\" and went behind the counter and got her own coat.  That lady was really cool... I wish she worked at this restaurant.    Food- 2 stars.  Some stewed lamb served on top of what we figured was banana bread (???),  guacamole & chips, ceviche & chips.  The best thing was the guacamole and chips.   They do have some colourful cocktails, so they get points there.   I would definitely come back here for drinks after a show or something like that, but not to eat."}
{"text":"The food is good. But bring ear plugs. The music is terribly loud. If you want to have a conversation you need to go elsewhere.   The tacos are small but have good flavor. Not what anyone would consider authentic Mexican, but tasty nonetheless."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! My hubby and I ordered the grilled shrimp, lamb tamale, and the octopus to start. The tamale was out of this world!!! All were delicious. We ordered the fish and the pork belly for mains- both really good. The Pinot noir we chose was delicious, as were the cocktails.  The service was slow at first. They were overwhelmed with the people that kept coming in- you could tell they were understaffed. The bottle of wine we ordered didn't arrive until after our appetizers were brought out, so that was frustrating however, the waiter DID bring us each a half glass of cava on the house in celebration of our anniversary- so that was nice. There were a few fruit flies when the wine came out. As annoying as they are, we have a few in our kitchen in the summer months, so I know they're hard to get rid of and not a sign of a dirty kitchen, so I overlooked them. In general, I really liked the decor, ambience, and set up. Great lighting, pretty colours on the walls, white linens, candles, a comfy booth seat, and a somewhat open kitchen.  All in all, we had a great anniversary dinner and thought the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Yum! Fantastic Winterlicious experience. I thoroughly enjoyed every dish, particularly the torta mollete which was piled high with fresh guac ;) I loved that the bread was soft but not mushy from all the toppings. I can't remember what the dessert was called but it was lovely."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant was amazing! It was the best Mexican I have had in Toronto. Every single dish we ordered was delicious- such a wonderful arrange of flavours. Not your typical array of Mexican (ie: no tacos on the menu)!  The service was also outstanding (especially for downtown Toronto on a Friday!). The General Manager was very kind, and even brought out the chef to meet the table.  Certainly a gem worth visiting."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service Chef even came over and was so very kind and humble If you want incredibly authentic Mexican food with impeccable service....you must go here!!!!"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to eat here. I have read that this restaurant was amongst the best new restauranst of 2014. I must say the Coconut Ceviche was probably the biggest dissapointment of the night, it lack that citrus kick I love about it. The rest of the food was alright nothing really stood out to me. The prices are quite high for the portions you are served. It is definetely not your $3.00 taco place  The service on the other hand was great and I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant but I don't need to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Los Colibris is definitely a cut above any Mexican restaurant in Toronto!  I had a lovely dinner with a friend on a blustery Wednesday night in April. I started with a superb Marguerita and we shared 4 appetizers so we could try many of the items on the menu. The Guacamole was perfection and served with taro and corn chips made in-house. The Empanada of the day was chicken - the serving was generous, but it was my least favourite item that we ordered. All the ceviches sounded great, so we ordered the Ceviche Tamarindo (on the waiter's recommendation) and it was beautifully presented and tasted AMAZING. The Ensalada de Col Rizada was unique and delicious. And finally ... the Torta de Elote was a dish I was unfamiliar with, but thought was melt in your mouth delicious.  The restaurant has a couple of \"private rooms\" for business or parties. On the night we were there, one of the parties hired an amazing mariachi band that we enjoyed.  The service was amazing from start to finish. The Hostess was polite, accommodating and gorgeous. Our waiter was attentive - not overbearing and never rushed us - which I really appreciate. Several (maybe 3) servers brought our many dishes to the table.  After we finished our dinner, a lovely woman (I do not know whether she is the Manger) came by to ask if it was our first visit, if we enjoyed the food, etc. We had a brief chat and as we were first-timers, she offered to pay for our shared dessert. We ordered the Buñuelos (hazelnut pecan rum-cake, peanuts, guava and dulce de leche ice creams) which was a perfect, not too sweet dessert to accompany the perfect espresso.  I was very impressed with the restaurant and will definitely be back soon to share it with more friends and business colleagues."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the house would be their beef tacos and spicy shrimp (which isn't spicy) . their daily flavored churos are also really good!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing atmosphere and knows how to treat their customers. Karen is awesome behind the bar and Manager James took care of a minor issue (cracked glass) with customer service skills far beyond any service I expected or have ever had in the past. We visited two nights  in a row and WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I had the Rajas Poblana through Uber Eats and it was delicious. For $10 I can't get over how tasty and how plentiful the portions were. I will need to visit in person."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch seeing that it was newly opened. Had a pleasant surprise that it was NOT an upscale wannabe taco place, but rather a very exquisite Mexican restaurant. I had the cuban sandwich (delicious) and my friend had the chicken stew, which was enjoyed as well.  Service was excellent, place was full but didn't feel crowded, may require reservations during lunch.  The reason it was not 5/5 simply due to the outrageous prices. Maybe I am a bit tough (downtown location, other restaurants charging relatively the same but sometimes even less) but I was taken aback by the bill. Didn't even drink. In the end - you get what you want in terms of food, I guess you gotta pay for it..."}
{"text":"Friend got the ceviche but found a hair entangled in it. I got the Alegria and it was good. Got the tortilla soup but not impressed. Good presentation though. Service was good. We had a larger group of 18 and all orders were correct. He hair was just gross as hell. Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Fresh, polished and delightful Mexican cuisine! Enjoyed everything we ordered except my main! I really wanted to love the Esquites. It seemed unique and looked gorgeous, but it was an odd mix of flavours and textures (watery, soft, lightly crispy, hot, spicy). Definitely a dish with multiple personalities. The biggest problem for me though was that it was too salty. I suppose that was what the watermelon was for - but that didn't work. The warm corn broth thankfully didn't make the watermelon mushy, but it did completely overwhelm its coolness and slight sweetness that may have balanced the saltiness of the dish. In fact, I didn't finish my main and that's rare for me. My friend though had the chipotle arrachera con frijoles and he completely cleaned off his plate! Despite the esquites, will nevertheless go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place! ; ) I am came with my uncle, cousin and sister for dinner. The dishes we tried were really unique and the service was one of the best.  They were so friendly, welcoming and non pretentious.   Back to the food.  The menu is always changing so it's hard to recall all the dishes.    We started off with what I think was the Rajas Poblanas  and a mushroom starter that was different than anything I've tried before. The Rajas Poblanas was rich and creamy and layered with flavour.  The mushroom starter was warming and very tasty also.   For my main I got the chicken empanada special for that day... forget the exact name :/  It was nice and crispy on the outside and the filling was really tasty... They had a citrousy kick from what I recall.  I also tried the Ceviche Blanco from my sister.  Good, but not my favourite here.   The Zona Rosa Hibiscus margarita that I sipped on for the most part of the meal was also an interesting elixir. I call it elixir because it tasted like a concoction made of exotic flowers taken from some forbidden island.   Finally, I got the Flan de Chocolate for dessert.  The mix of the burnt milk ice cream and the deep velvety chocolate was just mmmm ;))"}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner here before the symphony. The restaurant is located in the theatre district of Toronto and they were happy to accommodate our rather tight schedule. This is not your run-of-the-mill Mexican fare. It is sophisticated, presented in a beautiful way, and with more diverse flavours than you would normally expect.  If I were in Mexico City, I expect this would be this restaurant would be located in the Four Seasons Hotel. Great service, huge wine list and absolutely delicious food."}
{"text":"Phenomenal bar experience. Agave based  cocktails are a must try experience. Try some Mezcal, you won't be sorry.   Food is unusual for Mexican in the US. Many authentic recipes available. I chose poorly for my taste but ingredients were fresh,  food was hot and everyone is very friendly. I will be back."}
{"text":"So glad to have finally made it to Los Colibris. Went with a friend and ordered one of everything of the app menu, then went at it sharing style. The server was very knowledgeable, explained the unfamiliar dishes to us, and timed our items perfectly. The manager was so lovely and stopped in at our table to make sure everything was going well. My partner likes his drinks sweet so she personally re-topped his beverage to his liking. I had the house margarita with pineapple juice. It was so good I may have finished them (you can't have just one) a bit too fast. My favourite app was the rajas poblanos, I haven't stopped thinking about them since. For dessert (we tried three) my favourite was the tres leches. It is a Latin American favourite and Los Colibris does it well. Also, the ambience was great. It was nice to enjoy Mexican in a place where there isn't los muertos skulls everywhere. I love Mexican food in that environment too. It's just nice to see Mexican food done differently."}
{"text":"Dinner  Overall: 3.75 (Good)  Food & Value: 3.75/5 (Tasty but not necessarily memorable)  Ambience & Service: 4/5 (swarmed by TIFF goers, staff were still friendly and helpful)  Repeat: Not in a hurry, but can see ourselves dropping by.   Final word: Believe TO has fab (overpriced) tacos and guac & chips served with a heaping of pretension (not at this locale) but beyond that we still have a longway to go."}
{"text":"Came here after reading so many positive reviews  from yelp. Left fairly disappointed. The size of the tacos were unusually small but still tasty. Our service was quite bad. We ordered guacamole and chips which our server forgot to punch in as they came after our taco order and we had to ask our server if they were coming out soon. It seemed as though he punched the food in for the wrong table as each order we made continually kept going to the table next to us. All in all - a very mediocre experience."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! The rajas poblanas are amazing! The guac & chips are fabulous , and they put pomegranates in the guacamole! The service is always great and the food is incredible!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. Especially after all the great reviews. We started with the traditional ceviche. Maybe I set the bar too high and have been spoiled by Peruvian ceviche but this dish was unremarkable and awkward to scoop out of the glass it was served in.   Next I tried the soup of the day: tomatillo with hominy and chicken. It came out looking like dirty laundry water with chunks in it. The \"garnishes\" were insufficient to revive the scraps of chicken which were barely discernible from the hominy until I put it in my mouth.  My partner has the braised lamb which was the first time in my life I have ever described lamb as \"bland.\"  It was melt-in-my-mouth tender but had no flavour.   Lastly I had the grilled octopus dish. Again, it was cooked perfectly. Tender and not a trace of chewiness. But there wasn't much beyond the texture.    Overall the food was pretty and cooked to perfection (texture) but everything we tried fell flat on flavour. The dishes needed more depth.... more salt and pepper and spice to kick things up a notch. Something to make me want to reach for a cold quenching beer (or tequila).  Would not eat again. For delicious Mexican go to Milagro."}
{"text":"This is my second time in this restaurant.  For those whom are used to low budget Mexican food, you are in for a mind blow.  Gone are the typical taco, quesadilla etc, but everything is placed much dainty.  Had Winterlicious and main fare food. Winterlicious meal alone, did not blow my mind. Instead it left me leaving for more - small plates, not a lot of visual variety etc. I returned to try out its regular menu, where the rave reviews were based on.    I would like to suggest the  Chiles en Nogada for anyone who visit.  This dish was the favourite of the table, with a lot of good textures and flavour which is unique to this dish.  The various nuttiness that was incorporate in the sauce, and inside the stuffing was spectacular.  The selling point of the dish as per waiter's recommendation - this is a recipe passed down for generation to the head chef's family.  You might not be able to get it anywhere else.  The recommended dish usually is the Arrachera, which is basically a steak.  Although many tables ordered it, we found it was not our favourite.  The steak was hard to chew (at medium rare, even the inside was cook medium rare). Nothing to rave home about, except you got protein.  Yelp checkin to grab a compliment Tacos de Rajas Poblanas.  I would order this EVEN if its not free!  Please note this location is NOT AODA friendly. My partner came with a cane, and we asked for a seat with more comfort. As a table of 2, the only options are these tightly lined up tables with sliver of space. If you require rooms for mobility, this may not be a viable option"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday and came based on a recommendation from another friend.  We made reservations in advance and were seated as soon as we arrived. It worked out well as we had a nice quiet table in the back.  We had two servings of guacamole appetizers to share between the 4 of us and then went on to order our meals.  I had the chicken enchilada's and they were really good. I thought the outside of them were a little too filling but other than that it was good.  We had asked for a cake/dessert to be brought out after dinner and they brought the best one they had, my friend really loved and appreciated it.  my cons to this place are the dimmed lighting - it was hard to keep focused and stay awake with the food tasting so good and the only other con i had was being really close to the kitchen, i felt we walked away smelling more of food than we would of had we been sat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had a great visit to Los Colibris with a large group of friends. We were given an intimate and classy private room at the front of the restaurant overlooking King Street, and we were treated well by an attentive staff. The food was authentic and good, although I found the dishes I ordered to be a tad on the heavy side, when it comes to Mexican (which is just my personal taste)."}
{"text":"The food was good but the waiter didn't have a personality, cold as ice.  I have had friendlier service at Taco Bell.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Some dishes were better than others. The ceviche blanco was subpar. The marinated steak (chipotle arrachera) was very good. Rajas poblanas were mediocre.  It didn't feel very authentic (just an observation not a criticism--in case you were looking for actual Mexican food). I also noticed that there were many spelling mistakes on the menu (my first language is Spanish).  I probably won't come back due to the price:quality ratio."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for dinner here last night after trying to get a reservation FOREVER lol. I can now see why they are always booked up this place was fantastic!!!   First the margaritas were amazing! We had the Mango Tamarindo margarita which was fruity and light and the Duende Verde was so interesting, smokey and spicy unlike anything I have ever tried before.   For appetizers we had the enpenadas, guacamole and the salmon ceviche which were all so delicious. For dinner we had the Pescado El Pastor and the Arrachera which both had so much flavour.   The inside of this restaurant is so nice and romantic and suitable for any type of occasion. The service was also very good. I will definitely be returning again and again!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great atmosphere, excellent service and beautiful flavours.  The churro ice cream sandwich will forever hold a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"I went to Los Colibris on Thursday night with a group of 4. The Restaurant is larger than I thought with an entire hidden second half. Surprisingly it was only half full.   The service was excellent. Our guac came out within 1 minute of ordering it. Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgable.   The food was, for the most part, fantastic. Los Colibris takes traditional Mexican flavours and transforms them into complex, imaginative dishes.   We had:  Guacamole - 5/5 WOW! Not your typical guac. It was heavy on the citrus and topped with pomegranates.  I loved that there were taro chips along with the corn chips.   El Golondrino - 5/5 OMG YUM! This is a lamb tamale. A perfect blend of chewy textures and sweet flavours. I highly recommend this dish. All 4 of us loved it.   Ensalada de Betabel - 4/5 this salad has beets, carrot, lettuce and guava. It's refreshing with a tangy herb that I couldn't place but really enjoyed.   Chilies en Nogada - 4/5 I loved the presentation and the depth of this dish. Also loved the cinnamon.   Gallina de Chocolate - 5/5 best chicken with mole I've had.   El Jardin de Wookie - 5/5 a huge portion of seasoned grilled veggies in 2 delicious sauces.   Where they fell short was the Rajas poblanas which to me tasted exactly the like the Tostidos spinach dip. It was really nothing special 1/5   and the desert:  Tres Leches - 2/5 a coconuty moist cake with some lemon sorbet which I thought was okay but another person in the group found jarring. I really didn't care for the mushy texture of this dish. Nobody ate more than a spoonful.    I will definitely return to Los Colibris next time I feel like Mexican and highly recommend it to anyone who wants an unusual and delicious dining experience."}
{"text":"A nice fine dining alternative to the many fast-food type Mexican restos serving up tacos and enchiladas.  Ambiance and service was top notch.  Hosting and wait staff were professional and friendly, giving great recommendations to those who are not used to eating Mexican food.  The cocktails were nice.  I had the coffee infused one (forget the name) - it was different in a good way.  Unfortunately, the food was more miss than hit.  For starters, I tried the ceviche blanco as it caught my eye, using shrimp and coconut.  It was good, but could have been more tart.  I also split the pulpo a la parrilla (octupus w/ corn tortillas).   The corn tortillas were made in house and amazing.  The octopus on the other hand was bland and tasteless.  The tortilla soup was heavy on the salt as well.  The mains fared marginally better.  I had the chipoltle arrachera con frijoles which is essentially a steak with thick sauce consisting of refried beans.  The steak was cooked nicely, however the sauce was on the salty side.  Portion size was good.  Overall, OK.  The Cerdo en Macha Mantel (pork belly) was very good.  The pork was extremely tender and the pineapple salsa really gave it a nice kick.  It also comes with a fritter that was very tasty.  I shared the flan de chocolate at the end, which could have seriously bumped it to 3 stars... alas I was expecting something a bit more decadent.  I wasn't in a rush, but the kitchen was very slow.  Our whole meal took over 2.5 hours, and I was not taking my time.  Understaffed perhaps?  Overall, Los Colibris is a good restaurant for the area (tourist trappy king west, across roy thompson).  It has the ability to seat large parties and would be great for a business dinner.  The menu is refreshing, but the food is mediocre and expensive.  I can see what it is trying to be, but left feeling disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday dinner on Monday night and although I was already really excited to try it based on the menu and other reviews I'd read, I loved it even more than I expected. The service was fantastic and the food was incredible - you have to try the Rajas Poblanas! Andreas, the owner, came out to check on us and make sure we were happy with everything and then sent out a plate of all of their scratch made cookies for us to try with our dessert. All in all I was super impressed with this place and all the care they put into ensuring our experience was great. We didn't even mention it was my birthday to anyone at the restaurant, so none of this was special attention, just their usual attention to detail it seems. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"As a lover of flavour, heat, and all things Mexican, I was SO excited to try the Winterlicious menu at Los Calibris with some friends. As a table, we shared the guacamole, and two ceviches to start (the traditional and the tamarind). All were pretty good. I especially enjoyed the tamarind ceviche which was so tangy and flavourful. The traditional ceviche had great flavour, but had been sitting in the acid too long resulting in a slight chew on the fish.  To start off our three course Winterlicious menu, I ordered the Pozole de Cerdo y Camaron (soup with pulled pork, shrimp, fresh corn, and oregano). The presentation was underwhelming and the soup was... well... bad. The shrimp were horribly overcooked and mushy and the pulled pork was overwhelmed by the flavour of the shrimp. It was very one note and badly needed a textural element to help escape the mush. It was garnished with a lime wedge (which can only do so much to liven up this soup) and dried oregano - I expected better. My friends ordered the empanadas, which were alright, but kind of a safe choice to place on the menu in my opinion.  The second course was Ropa Vieja (brisket, pico de gallo, egg, chayote, toastadas). It was beautifully presented but lacked any sort of heat or acid to balance the salty brisket and tostadas. I asked for habanero sauce which helped waken the flavours of the dish. I think everyone at the table was thinking the same thing, as the hot sauce was used up within seconds.  I opted for the Helados y Nieves (sorbet) for dessert which was a rather boring choice I know, but spectacular! I was served passion fruit and mango sorbet alongside a scoop of dolce de leche ice cream, and topped with the perfect amount of some crunchy cookie thing. Really outstanding.  Overall, it was a fun evening despite the food because the restaurant had a great vibe and the service was good. I have heard only great things about Los Calibris, so my meal was a disappointment. Some might argue that because it was Winterlicious, the meal was lower quality than it usually would be. I would like to think that Los Calibris can generate better food than this, but the chef should know that the Winterlicious diners only have that one meal as a reflection of her cooking. Was it enough to make me want to go back? Not any time soon."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Mexican cuisine and have been looking for an upscale place with new flavours as we're very familiar with the traditional dishes. I think the novelty of the meats that Colibris works with does not quite mask the lack of flavour here. We had the octopus to start - cooked perfectly but completely overpowered by the beans. I wouldn't pair such a meaty legume with the light meat of octopi. I had the duck carnitas, which were not bad (again, confit was perfect) but this came with mediocre accompaniments (though the candied walnuts were interesting). My boyfriend's steak was teeny, I couldn't quite believe it. The churros came with a weird water chocolate sauce. The servers seemed to have not quite figured out who was serving us. Also, what is with the dimness of the lighting? We were holding the candle up to our meals to see what we were eating. Overall disappointing. However, I think for sure that this would be a fun place to come and sit in the lounge and order some tapas and drinks."}
{"text":"We came here for a friends birthday dinner and it was absolutely amazing. We ended up being 30 minutes late to our reservation and we were still seated with no issues. The service was amazing, they were very attentive and helped guide us through the menu making very helpful suggestions. The food was delicious, we ordered the guacamole and empanadas as an appetizer and the chicken and flat iron steak for our main course. Everything was amazing right down to the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We celebrated Valentine's Day here (a bit early). Delicious guacamole for starter and small plates to share. Queso fundido was a bit too greasy for us, but everything was flavorful and service was excellent. Delightful cilantro and pineapple margarita."}
{"text":"Nothing to say but great authentic Mexican. I love some of the reviews from people who consider Houston as the meca of authentic Mexican. How about mention an actual Mexican city."}
{"text":"My favourite place for upscale Mexican in the city!  Make sure to check in on yelp for the rajas poblanas:)  The empanadas are great and my friend had the vegetarian el jardin de wookie and really enjoyed it. I had the chiles en nogada."}
{"text":"What an unexpected find. First, I want to thank our Toronto Yelpers for the accurate reviews. This place was even better than I expected.   First, this ain't no regular Mexican restaurant. It is high end, high quality, and highly good. Cloth table coverings set the mood for a wonderful night out for delicious Mexican specialties.   Second, yeah there are chips and guacamole on the menu, as a side dish. However, with pomegranate seeds? Mmm, it was fantastic. And with the homemade hot/spicy sides to add to your liking, this guac was like none other for a great ample app for two. They will provide more corn chips, if needed.  Third, my entree was a stuff gigantic pepper loaded with pork chucks, fruit, veggies deep fried and covered that a light creamy sauce to die for. There were additional roasted veggies and rice blended around the sides of the plate. I've never tasted anything like this in all my food loving life. It was brilliant. This chef is top end gourmet.  Forth, I finished it up with a 3 dairy cake (tre-lechi - sorry about the spelling) with a type of sour sorbet/gelato resting on top. That did it! I was in gourmet Mexican heaven. Such a lovely place to be on Cinco de Mayo.   Fifth, the waiter, Edward, was ultra-helpful, kind, efficient and charming. He definitely made my dining experience even more enjoyable.   This is a five star restaurant and a must experience when in Toronto. It's not far from the Rogers and Maple Leafs arenas. Don't let it being categorize Mexican cuisine throw you off. It is a special food experience for the lovers of a quality meal. Do not miss this place. Please check it out."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for Winterlicious. Okay let me begin my saying winterlicious menus are going downhill. From about 3 years ago, menus were actually worth trying but nowadays they're just mediocre.  Overrated and overpriced. This might be the last winterlicious event I'm ever going to. Dinner menus are definitely not worth it anymore.  First, the experience was going well. Our entrees came  really quickly. Maybe about 5 minutes after being seated. I enjoyed my ceviche. My boyfriend's isnt so great. He got the soup which he described as \"very much like Campbell soup...watery.\" My boyfriend is actually not picky at all so it's surprising that he made this comment. Nonetheless we were hopeful that the experience would get better. Then the main courses arrived. I got the tilapia with rice and my boyfriend ordered the meatballs. I was fine with my order. It was not amazing but there was really nothing to complain about. Maybe it just needed a little kick. My boyfriend ate the meatballs. He cut the first meatball and it was raw inside - literally the colour was red. He was confused by it but ate it anyway thinking, \"maybe this is how they're made?\". But the second meatball came out cooked so he knew he had to ask. And yes, the meatballs turned out to be undercooked. It was nice that the waiter immediately took action and everything was fixed - he got another plate of meatballs which he enjoyed. Then we got dessert. I liked my plantain but my boyfriend again didn't like his dessert. He only liked the coconut ice cream. The rice pudding was not that great.  Okay so he definitely did not like the experience. For 80 dollars he said it was definitely not worth it. I appreciate the effort from the waiter to try to make things better though. Very nice of them. The service was great but the quality of food is not as great. Therefore I would rate them a 3.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"I was looking for an upscale restaurant for date night and my boyfriend loves Mexican, so why not? Started off with some drinks while we waited for our table. Their drink menu is quiet extensive (especially if you love tequila).   So now food.... we started with the guac and chips and empanadas - the guac had a nice twist with pomegranates and the chips were made in-house, yum!  For our entrees, I got the rajas poblanos (technically an appetizer but was told it was big enough to be an entree) and my boyfriend got the chipotle arrachera (steak). When the dishes arrived, I was surprised to see that my 'entree' was double the size of the steak dish (literally double - my dish came with 4 tortillas and the steak dish only came with 2) but only half the price.   Regardless, the rajas poblanos was creamy and rich - one of the most delectable tacos I've ever had. Now on to the chipotle arrachera tacos... neither of us were very impressed with the taste or size of the dish, it was very meh to us and I regretted ordering it.   Overall, the service was great and the ambiance is intimate. I enjoyed our food, but nothing really excited us enough to warrant a second visit."}
{"text":"An amazing Mexican restaurant in downtown Toronto. I came here during the Summerlicious, and all were great."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner last night. After going for a long walk downtown i stopped at this place to grab dinner and it did not disappoint. I started with a tequila beverage, followed by Arrachera \"flat iron steak\" the meal was full of flavours and very enjoyable. For dessert I had créma de cafe and again what a great way to finish a meal.   Great evening and will visit this place again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Mexican fine dining at its best where food, service and ambience perfectly blend with each other. My wife and I extremely fond of Mexican cuisine and there was no better place to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Our server was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and made us more than comfortable. We ordered flat iron steak with chorizo and tacos and pork piccadillo. Being our anniversary we were offered complimentary dessert which unfortunately we had to resist as we were stuffed to the brim. Our server did the most wonderful gesture by offering us a plate of galletas with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on our plate. In addition he offered us Tromba tequila that really hit the spot. I'd definitely go back to try other entrees that looked fascinating."}
{"text":"Lots of flavours.  Great service. Nice atmosphere. Reasonable priced. Some interesting items on the menu."}
{"text":"When I heard there was a new upscale Mexican restaurant in Toronto, I had to come. My birthday dinner was a great excuse to get my friends out to try this place. The reception at the restaurant was really warm. The hostess was friendly and attentive. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and classy. If you are familiar with El Catrin (one of my favorites) this is the complete opposite. Los Colibris is like the expensive, older sister of other Mexican restaurants in Toronto. The food was delicious, although a little too salty for my taste. I ordered the empanadas (beautiful presentation), Rajas Poblonas and Tortilla soup. I enjoyed my experience. Would I go back on my own, probably not. If someone suggests it, yes."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both times was underwhelmed. The cocktails are good, but the food is average at best. Guacamole comes out ice cold, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. I had the steak - the topping was cold. Everything from service to food is just inconsistent. I like the decor, but the restaurant is super loud. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"As a Mexican, I wasn't looking for an authentic traditional cuisine.  And good thing I wasn't because Los Colibris is a modern take on Mexican classic dishes.  Starting with the Ceviche de tamarindo, the flavors of the jicama, tamarindo, mango and cilantro were on point.  Quite the blend and served in perfect portions. Next was the Pozole.  Again, the flavors that came out of this bowl were beautiful, thick and reminded of me how I wanted Pozole to taste like as a kid.  Traditional, yet bold.  Then came the Albondigas.  These little turkey meatballs came out cooked perfectly, but just missed a certain texture I was looking for.  The sauce and veggies complemented the dish well, but the Albondigas themselves were missing some herbs.    And last, dessert.  Holy crap the Dulce de leche helado (ice cream) was KILLER.  I wish I would have asked for two scoops of that instead of mixing it with mango sorbet.  I'm coming back before my trip is over.  Excellent cocktails and FANTASTIC cuisine.  Los Colibris has best the brown guy test"}
{"text":"The food was good however do not order tostadas as it is a rip for $14 and you only get one piece.  The moist milk cake dessert was awesome and definitely worth $11!  I will only go back if there is a special occasion- it is relatively expensive for the amount of food we got."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant, 4.5 out of 5.  Excellent service, from the greeters to the busboys.  Lovely room, lighting warm and inviting, tables not too close.  Chef really knows what she is doing, this is high end Mexican cooking, not Tex-Mex.  We ordered the guacamole with hand made chips and pomegranate seeds, delicious.  We both had soup to start on this cold night.  Main choices were the pork belly and baked halibut, both fabulous with veggies, Mexican seasoning, full of flavour.  We finished by sharing a dessert of rum cake with homemade ice cream, perfect way to end the meal.  Not your average Mexican eatery.  Go after 7:45 to avoid the theater crush."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here before going to the Yo Yo Ma concert. they were booked solid but we decided to eat at the bar and we are glad we did. Casey did an excellent job in not only mixing drinks but also serving us the pre theatre menu  if you are going to the  theater, make sure to stop by and ask to be served by Casey at the bar. Candace is the GM and she does a good job of running  the place."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and good location. Mediocre food and extremely slow service. I was with a party of 6 and it took us just over 3 hours from beginning to end. We weren't eating slowly at all. Thank goodness we skipped appetizers, as I imagine that would have taken another 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant in Toronto. Loved their decor. My girlfriend wanted to give me a challenge for our 6th valentines day. So she asked me to find a Mexican restaurant. I went on Google and I choose L.C. I got a call from L.C a week later advising me about their V-Day special menu.  Half way through our menu, we were informed that our server got sick so she went home.. Up until that point, we were satisfied.   Then it went on \"wait drag\" What really threw me off was when our main course. Of the two main course We choose the \"whole fish\". What I didn't know that they literally meant \" whole Fish\".   It was a shared menu, but then when the \"whole Fish\" arrived with its head and tail.. I didn't know what to say.. The only took out the fish spine.. Rest of the other bones were still in it.. Ask yourself that how romantic would it be.. if you see your date kept on taking out fish bones from their mouth??   The wait period was ok... My server went home so well it was understandable.. but price wise.. It wasn't worth 60$ per person. I was hungry even after I ate and I am not a huge guy.. Only 154lbs.. So we went to The Burger's Priest after lol.   Overall, it wasn't a really bad experience. Could have been better but it wasn't the worst. For a romantic dinner, I will recommend just dont order the Whole Fish."}
{"text":"If you want to break away from the stereotypes of mexican food (taco bell/borritos) this is a nice restaurant to explore some of the Spanish dishes out there.  Food is a bit pricy, portions could be a bit bigger.  My pet peeve, seeing my empanadas covered in a mountain of lettuce and cheese in the hopes you don't evaluate them visually."}
{"text":"In short: Really really good food, classy environment, and attentive service.   In detail: Started with Guac & Chips which had a very interesting flair of pomegranates which added a really nice flavour combination. Then moved on Rajas Poblanos which is was also very tasty, especially wrapped in the home made flour tortillas. The problem with both these starters was that they give you too few chips and too few tortillas to actually eat the whole dish. This is something I've noticed in restaurants lately that really bugs me. You know I'm going to need more than the amount supplied, why nickle and dime for the additional items required to enjoy the dish? Moving past that, I had the Chilies en Nogada for a main which is a pepper stuffed with pork and walnut sauce over rice and veg. The best part of the pepper was after stuffing it they actually lightly deep fry it. I have zero complaints about this and would recommend it to anyone.  Cocktail menu is tequila heavy, and the beer options are all Mexican including a couple of Mexican craft beer options.  Overall, I really enjoyed Los Colibris. It might just be the most expensive Mexican food in the city, but with the white tablecloths, attentive service, and higher level ingredients, it's easier to see where the money has gone by the time you're paying the bill which lightens the burden."}
{"text":"Came here on the first night for Winterlicious '17!  2 tips- 1. Reserve for Winterlicious on Opentable in advance - while I booked the day before the dinner and didn't have trouble finding a spot, I did have trouble booking the time I wanted. 2. When you get to the building realize that the below ground, louder, more hip restaurant is the sister restaurant. To get to Los Colibris you must climb up the adjacent stairs to this condo-looking entrance :)  Food- 3.5/5. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food and Los Colibris did not change my mind. The ingredients are very fresh and presentation of the mains was beautiful. We ordered a guac ($10, regular menu) to start. The guac had very fresh avocados and pomegranate seed and was not super citrus-y. The Tostada de Ceviche appetizer (pescatarian) was so-so at best - it looked kind of sad with a small pile of toppings on a tasteless crispy tostada. The Jardin de Wookie main (vegetarian) was hearty, filling, beautifully presented, but a bit bland. The desserts were pretty ok - the Helados Y Nieves (housemade sorbet and ice cream) was really small, but very fresh! The sorbet tasted just like the real fruit. My partner ordered the Capirotada (= Mexican bread pudding with pumpkin spice ice cream), which he didn't like, but I thought the pumpkin spice ice cream was amazing. It tasted like a Starbucks PSL and was so smooth and creamy.  Value- 2/5. Overpriced, but as expected.  Service- 5/5. Water was always promptly refilled. Super friendly servers, huge smiles, and not pretentious at all like at some fancier restaurants. Also answered all my stupid questions on ingredients, etc.  Venue- 4/5. Much quieter and calmer than the sister restaurant downstairs. A lot of customers until after 9PM, so at times had some trouble hearing from across the table. Had Spanish (?) background music that wasn't overbearing playing the whole time. Classy tablecloth and real candles. I felt like I was dining in a gazebo on a Caribbean beach :P A great date spot or place to take in-laws, but families and casual friend gatherings might want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"First trip to Canada and we found this awesome Hispanic restaurant with great selection of music ! I didn't have a chance to eat but the food looks delicious . Unfortunately I could only give this restaurant 2 stars because I didn't appreciate the hostess stating that I  look old when I was showing her my id to enter on a Friday night . Are you trying to gain business or lose business ?"}
{"text":"Very likely, one of the best -- the very BEST -- restaurants that I have EVER been to in Toronto.  Without a doubt, this is very quickly going to get on every list of Where to Eat in the city.   Went here for a Valentine's Day prix fixe menu last night for the first time.  Every detail of their delivery just blew me away.  A few details... Location is in the entertainment district, right beside the theatre.  You'd think its a tourist trap, some kitschy little spot that caters to overdone theatre goers who are looking for any remotely satiating food. Not in the least.  The restaurant is so beautifully done on the inside, and if you can ask to steal a look at the private dining room look up at the chandelier.  You'll see how the \"hummingbird\" theme weaves itself through the decor.    The staff...  We had a 10:30pm reservation.  Grave yard shift for Valentine's Day. Last seating of the night.  And yet, everyone, from the person at the check in desk, to the shift manager, to the bartenders, to the busboy, to the waiter were super energetic, friendly, chatty, professional, upbeat, everything.  From a management perspective, something very right is happening in your human resources department.  How a place can successfully hire an entire staff where every single person delivers the exact same positive experience is amazing to me.  (Really... How do you screen for hospitality like that in an interview?).There were probably about ten to twelve staff that we interacted with during the night and they were all consistently on their A-game. Super professional service.  It is noticed.    The food... Christ.  If it wasn't Valentine's Day I would have proposed to my plate.  It was just so, totally delicious, and for a prix fixe menu at that.  The guacamole and tortilla chips, taro chips, lightly salted, with pomegranate seeds in the guac.  Amazing texture, perfectly salted, and there was this light spice on the taro and corn tortilla chips that were amazing.  I could have had a bowl of these for myself.  The Camarones a la Diabla.  Huge, delicious, shrimp just fell off the shell, perfectly marinated, not too greasy, filling, generous portions.    This dish, which I cannot find on the menu now, but you need to ask the waiter about...  A cast iron skillet with cheese and meat sort of stuck to the pan, which you smear onto this ultra soft tortilla.  I've never had anything like it but I was smiling as I was eating this the entire time. How a dish can make you feel (and even before I drank my cocktail :). Totally amazing.    The main course... Chipotle Arrachera con Frijoles.  Also, just amazing.  The cast iron steak pieces are just perfectly cooked, and the accompaniments you can stuff into a tortilla are so satisfying.  There was also a bowl of, I think, sopa del dia with beans.  The weather outside was around -31 Celsius with windchill, and I think we may have tried to smuggle a bowl back to our car to eat on the drive home! Warm, satisfying.  Finally, for dessert, I'm pretty sure it was this concoction that may have only been there for Valentine's Day, but another dish worth asking for.  Churro ice cream sandwiches.  Really?  How much do I love the entire Latin culture and the creator of churros at baseline?  And now an ice cream sandwich in that?  Presentation was beautiful.  A stick of edible raspberry flavored marshmallow, and a stick of dark chocolate Valentine candy.  Why?  Just because it adds to the flavors and presentation.  The drinks, we had one pisco tequila and another pink colored tequila cocktail.  Delicious.  Perfect, and the pisco one smelled as good as it tasted. Final touch?  The check, such a creative way it's presented.    It's the details. The attention to service, presentation of the food, the manner of the people in the restaurant -- like it's their home, even when it's the last seating on a busy night.   I can't say enough about this restaurant.  The cost: 30 minute drive, -31 Celsius weather, 10:30pm reservation, finding parking downtown, $150 bill for two with drinks... But truly, truly, worth every cent."}
{"text":"Came in during Summerlicious. Food as a whole was delicious! We ended up being seated at the bar table due to a mix up on our end with scheduling. It was soon apparent to us that being seated at the bar table meant that service would not be as good as being seated on the regular tables. Service was good overall but we felt like we were being overlooked since we were not asked how our food was (everyone else was asked how their food was) and it took a while for our bill to come as well. Great food overall but service needs a bit of work."}
{"text":"First time trying an upscale Mexican restaurant and if talking purely on food sans fancy linen and dim candlelight ambience, we had a decent meal but nothing that really stood out to have us excited for a second visit.   - Pink guava margarita: I think I may have a thing for guava but this is worth trying - light, fragrant and not overly sweet or strong.  -Tijuana Caesar: this was a surprising one because I didn't expect much from a Caesar salad but the combo of sour cream with warm spicy minced pork really worked and may have been the best thing I liked that night.  - Grilled octopus with tortilla: octopus was tender and the warm tortilla had an interesting thickness and chewiness to it. Could use a little more flavouring though.  - Guac: who doesn't like guac but i think they can be more generous on the guac as there was way too much tasty taro chips for the small amount of guac.  - Tortilla soup: Didn't taste much beyond the basic sour and tomatoey flavour. Would not recommend.   - Ceviche tamarindo: this was definitely the biggest bummer.. I love ceviche but the ceviche here just didn't sing to me. It needed more acid and the fish didn't taste that fresh.  Service was attentive and ambiance of the place was intimate and maybe a tad too dim - although some might prefer this since everyone looks a little better in dimmer lighting right..  Going in with realistic expectations is probably the best way to enjoy this place.. But with the price you pay for an upscale restaurant why go in with realistic expectations?"}
{"text":"Visited with my mom following seeing a musical down the street at the theatre. I had purchased a Mirvish package deal for her as a Christmas present which came with two dinner vouchers and included Los Colibris as an option with a set menu.  Our server was lovely - attentive and helpful in recommending dishes to us. The set menu we had a voucher for was limited but they did offer choices we both enjoyed. When I checked in on Yelp, an offer popped up for free tacos which our server fulfilled with no hesitation. I assumed because we had the vouchers the Yelp offer would be rejected but she was kind enough to allow us to use it as well. Side note, the tacos were delicious and as I had mentioned I don't eat meat at the beginning of the meal, the server made them vegetarian for us - thank you!!  The flavours of the food were very good and fairly different from any Mexican food I have had before. My personal fave part of the meal were the homemade churros with ice cream we enjoyed at the end.  I would like to visit again and try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Most memorable feature: Underwhelming food  Came for summerlicious dinner.  The wait staff were wonderfully attentive! They came to our table to explain each meal that arrived and were very receptive to our responses.  The quality of food on the other hand were a different story.  The dinner portions surprisingly small even for the $38 summerlicious bracket.  Desserts and drinks were quite well done but we left somewhat hungry even though our meal had cost the equivalent of a nice knitsweater from Zara.  Dishes ordered: Ensalada de Col Rizada, Pozole Blanco de Pollo, Pescado al Ajillo, Pollo Zapata, Tres Leches, Churros"}
{"text":"Had rajas poblanas (a creamy chicken taco) and gallina de chocolate (chicken mole). Rajas poblanas were amazing. One of the best if not the best tacos I've ever had, but it's more of a tasty chicken with a tortilla you can make a taco with.  Gallina de chocolate - not the best mole I've ever had. Solid flavors, good balance of vegetables, but the mole was a little more sesame/chocolate and less spice than I'm used to.  Guava margarita also pretty good but not spectacular.   Service, however, was spectacular. Attentive, multiple people came to check in (genuine, not just a forced question). I think overall a very good restaurant experience.  It's hard to have a high-end Mexican place, but Los Colibris does it pretty well. If not for the amazing service, I would say it could be a solid high-end but not fancy restaurant. But with the service this good, it could probably do well just to have a bit more creativity in plating."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Server super friendly .. With music I left like I was in carribien ... Deserts yummyyyyylicious !!!! Definitely place to come back."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner last night to celebrate a birthday and I must say I was really disappointed with the food. We ordered the Guacamole and tacos de rajas poblanas as appetizers both of which were extremely ordinary tasting. The chicken was very bland and had zero flavor. The tortilla soup was just about ok. I tried the duck confit entree and I wasn't able to take more than a couple of bites.  Having been to Mexico a few times and eaten locally there, I found it hard to believe that the food here could be so tasteless.  On the plus side: the tre leches cake that I had for dessert was delicious. The service was absolutely top notch with the servers being very attentive and thorough.   Would I go back here, though? Definitely not."}
{"text":"Ended up here accidentally after confusing this spot with its sister Mexican restaurant  El Caballito (downstairs). The service was excellent and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and flavours, offering smart recommendations and good wine pairings. We were in a rush trying to make it to a show next door at the Royal Alex, and Los Colibris was very accommodating in cooking and serving quickly but without feeling like we were being rushed out. I enjoyed the octopus appetizer, which was delicious and had some warm, spicy notes and unique flavour combinations without being \"weird\". My friend enjoyed her cheesy appetizer dish very much. One warning/area for improvement is the limited selection of vegetarian options: there are a few but they are pretty standard (salad, veggies, main dishes without meat) and don't enjoy the same creativity or uniqueness that the other dishes offer."}
{"text":"Superb place to dine at. From the attentive service folks to the fantastic food fare. This place lives up to a top ten list that it was recently mentioned it"}
{"text":"Five of us had an early dinner before the theatre. The food was delicious.  I can't think of a restaurant in Toronto doing anything like this.  The staff were great at explaining the specials and answered questions about the menu, the service team left us wanting for nothing, it was a real pleasure.   We kind of made pigs of ourselves and ordered many different dishes.  Ceviche Tamarindo, Queso Fundido, Rajas Poblanas, Cerdo en Mancha Mantel, Breggo Pinot Gris and the margarita's were highlights.  We're going back."}
{"text":"The Rajas Poblanos was dy-no-mite!  Favourite dish of 2014. All the things you want, great good and great service!"}
{"text":"Excellent and friendly service, incredible food, I absolutely recommend this place to any foodies out there for a taste of real mexican food. Especially good chiles en nogada, and the octopus is unbelievably good."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is an excellent addition to Toronto's food scene!!  This isn't a taco and guac type place that has proliferated all over this city, this is Mexican fine dinning ant it's best.  The restaurant is gorgeous, classy and warm.  The service is excellent, and the food is amazing and delicious!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was a great choice for a romantic date night. The server was really attentive and helped us understand what was on the menu, since it was really authentic Mexican. Ended up sharing veggie empanadas and corn cake with my girlfriend and ordered a fancy dessert with coffee flavoring. Food was expensive for the amount of food given and the basic lime margarita was awful. The decor was beautiful and it was a nice experience overall but was too expensive."}
{"text":"Ambiance was semi formal but with friendly service. Good presentation and wine pairings were very appealing. Attentive service and good wine recommendations.   Food was mediocre for its price. Heavy on the palette and one dimensional in taste. Overwhelming seasoned which took out the delicacy is different flavours. The guacamole with pomegranate seeds coupled with taro chips added a nice flare. Main entrees were pricey but nothing stood out. Chicken was a bit dry. Portions were quite large.   Overall was a decent dining experience but the price you pay for its mediocre food didn't justify."}
{"text":"Axl is the best bartender I've ever had. He made our experience unbelievable and we will definitely be back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing evening here for a friend's birthday. Service was very prompt and since we all wanted to try a million dishes, our server just went ahead and split all of the apps among the 7 bills. Didn't even need to ask! Love! I had the Arrachera and it was fantastic. Guacamole and chips was great- wanted a couple more chips though! Definitely do the Yelp check-in to receive the Tacos de Rajas Poblanas! Amazing tortillas here!"}
{"text":"A friend from out of town insisted that we try Los Colibris. It had met with rave reviews and was regarded highly by people who seem to know a lot about this sort of thing.  Well, I wouldn't say skip it, but I won't be back too quickly. If you find yourself heading down to this restaurant....  1. The margaritas are average. 2. The wine list is good, but many of the wines are a bit young and need to be decanted. 3. The small plates are not exactly small. The Rajas app could be a slightly too salty meal by itself. 4. The empanadas are reasonably good. 5. The beef ribs are well-cooked and served with potatoes and beans. It is a huge portion. 6. The lamb dish is downright bad. 7. Service is attentive, though chaotic. 8. The place is white table cloth, which is nice in a town where much isn't.  Conclusion- Toronto is not a great Mexican food city. Los Colibris is a decent option for those who want higher end Mexican food with the awareness that Toronto is not yet Houston."}
{"text":"Location: right in the theatre entertainment district, excellent for a bite before a show. However being downtown parking is scarce or expensive.   Atmosphere: very dark, the lights were too dimmed down. Lots of staff on hand to keep everything running smoothly. However I feel that their Spanish pronunciation needs to be practiced. Decor is classy and upscale. Very nice. Not a fan of some of the portrait paintings. One in particular is a dark man with red eyes? A bit freaky I think.     Food: absolutely phenomenal!!! I ordered the pescado verde. Delectable!!! It had all my taste buds craving for more. Same goes for the tres leches dessert. I could go back for that again and again. I wasn't a fan of the ceviche. It is definitely not like other Mexican restaurants I have been that are authentic.    Service: friendly staff. They were always busy which is a good thing.   Price: for the portion you are served, it is quite pricey, but knowing the location and that it is a high end restaurant who prides themselves on exceptional flavours, I would do it again. Only on a special occasion ;)"}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a local....  Why it's a solid option:  1. slick space 2. amazing drinks 3. quality meats, but only 2 tortillas + charging extra for more  4. reasonable service, but not super attentive  worth a return"}
{"text":"For options in the city, Los Colibris was the most upscale restaurant that specializes in Mexican food (that I've been to). The service was excellent and patiently explained everything to us as we wrestled through the menu to figure out what we wanted. Our server was so good that she remembered a member of our party from his previous visits with them! The space is very dimly lit and was loud when the space filled up later in the night.  Food-wise, we ordered a bunch of items and shared them around the table. A stand out of the night was the Chiles en Nogada and the Empanadas. Both were favorites around the table. Yes, the price point is definitely higher than other Mexican restaurants ($11.50 for guacamole?) but you are definitely paying for the location, atmosphere and service also."}
{"text":"Upscale Mexican cuisine with great service! I have been to the restaurant 3 times in past year and every time it manages to impress me. From pomegranate guacamole to ceviche to carefully curated summerlicious menu, every dish was full of flavour but not overwhelming. One of my favourite is the Guarache de Pulpo en su Tinta - octopus cooked to the perfectly that is juicy and tender laid on top of a bed of squid ink sauce (very interesting concept)."}
{"text":"I was SO excited to try out this place, but perhaps my expectations were overly inflated.  We ate: - Poblanas (2/5): I found this was okay, the richness overpowered the flavour. - The poblano stuffed with chicken served with cashew sauce (3/5): Interesting play on sweet and savory, but ended up being too sweet.  I like the concept, the space is nice too, just find the food lacking."}
{"text":"Located right in the middle of Entertainment District.....You know where the Mexican singers sing......this came as a pleasant surprise. Ambience and service both good. It is a little pricy. But worth a visit.  For appetizer - We ordered Papas Bravas, their spicy potatoes. It was really spicy and really good. It was also a big portion. We also tried the cocktails - Mine was the  Jamaican something and my friend had the Margarita. Mine was very strong. Hers was a slightly lighter cocktail.   For main course, I ordered Pulpo ala Parilla, the grilled Octopus and my vegetarian friend ordered Rajas Poblanas on the recommendation of the hostess. Mine was delicious. It came as a small edible cup like thing. The flavours were really good. Octopus can be really rubbery at some restaurants. This was soft and very flavourful. I may have found a favourite dish. I highly recommend it. The Rajas Poblanas was good too.....very rich. Even though these were not part of the main course, both were extremely filling. We had no room left for dessert.  I recommend that you try this place."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal at this place! They now have vegan options....I had the guacamole and taro and corn chips. My son had the FREE TACOS that we got for checking in on yelp (yay yelp!). I had the main veg item on the menu though the daily veg special also sounded great. Both were vegan. They now make a cashew cheese and the croquettes were rice based My son had the steak dish and asked for the steak medium. It arrived rare but they took it back, apologized, and corrected it. My son said it was the best steak he's ever tasted! I had the soursop sorbet (not a fan of the flavour but my son loved his dulce de leche and spiced chocolate ice creams. Beautiful decor, great location, friendly service, delicious food, a bit pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious- though the empanadas and service were good the main and dessert were a crazy let down - lacking completely in flavour - way to timid, nod the main was luke warm at best. W each of us getting 2 drinks w there our bill was $170.  Save your money and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"So Winterlicious prompted a friend and I to finally try this place after months of wanting to check it out. Upon our arrival, we noted that the restaurant was far fancier than we had anticipated, so we were excited to start eating.  We decided to deviate from the Winterlicious menu by starting with an order of guacamole. Mixed with pomegranate, the guac was served with just a handful of fresh nachos. This paucity of chips didn't deter from what was otherwise a very tasty plate of guacamole, with the sweetness of the pomegranate certainly an innovative (and delicious) innovation. It was disappointing that we weren't given more nachos, though, as I was forced to eat the remainder of the guac with a fork. (Not the classiest move, admittedly, but I wasn't going to let any of it go to waste.)  Okay, so the Winterlicious menu. I started with the Pozole de Cerdo y Camaron, which is a soup containing pulled pork, shrimp, corn, oregano, and macha oil. The presentation was very pretty, to be sure, but the soup was just average at best. There was nothing specifically *wrong* with it - the pulled pork was soft and plentiful, for example - and yet there was also nothing mind-blowing about it either. It tasted like a soup I could've had at Panera or some other fast-food-type place.  Expectations were high for the main, which was the Ropa Vieja (brisket, pico de gallo, egg, chayote, and tostadas). Again, the presentation was top-notch but the food was just so-so. Aside from being an almost comically tiny portion, the brisket (and its accompanying ingredients) was very run-of-the-mill and average. Admittedly, the meat was very soft and tender, but the dish was nothing to get terribly excited about. The word mediocre was practically invented to describe this Ropa Vieja.  Finally, the dessert arrived. I went with the Gelatina de Rompope, which is a rum-flavoured jello. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the dish was adequate but nothing exceptional. It was actually a fairly frustrating end to a consistently middling meal. (I should note that my dining companion felt the same way about the food.)  Given the cost and average food, I simply can't recommend Los Colibris to anyone. And I certainly won't be returning."}
{"text":"We came here for summerlicious 2016 and had a great time. First off the service is top-notch. Our server was excellent and we got a lot of personal attention from the manager Javier, who went out of his way to find us a place to change our baby's diaper. And of course THE FOOD. So good!! The salad and tostada starters were both great and the chicken main was superb. Poblano sauce is crazy good. The vegetarian main was apparently not amazing but our friend supplemented with an empanada and was very happy with that. Desserts were nothing to write home about but everything else was great great great. We didn't realize this place was so fancy but they made us feel welcome even with a rambunctious toddler in tow."}
{"text":"Came here for a girls night out. Overall the experience was quite underwhelming. It is located in a central location on king street - we were lucky enough to find street parking close by. My friend made reservations so we were seated promptly upon arrival.   The ambience was trendy and stylish.  A nice place to bring a date - great lighting. Service was prompt. Cocktails were tasty - esp the mango tamarind margarita and their version of a jalapeño margarita. For an app I got this yellowtail taco that was OK and for entree I had this spicy shrimp. My friends ordered the octopus, chicken tacos and queso. For dessert it was the churro with ice cream.  The food was expensive, the taste below average and the ambience was cozy and stylish. Personally I do not think I see myself coming her again anytim soon."}
{"text":"If you are looking for chips and salsa free, food truck tacos and cheap margaritas.  Not the place. But there are times for that type of Mexican food. And then there are times for Los Colibris.  Refined. Relaxing ambience. Quieter. Think intimate dinner with partner. Or a place to have a business or old friend dinner where you can hear each other.    Food is unique and seasonal. Vegan and vegetarian options. Even saw gluten free options.   Daily ceviche, empanada, soup, and vegan option. Fish chicken pork and beef in a variety of presentations. I had the chicken meatballs. Seasonal- fiddleheads and asparagus. A bit of heat and very tasty.  Drink menu had your classic margarita. But try a mango or the spicy one.   Service was great, not pushy or lacking.   Would recommend this place to friends who are looking for great Mexican food"}
{"text":"I've been twice for work parties. They have a nice room right in the front of the restaurant overlooking King that seats ~12. Great margaritas, guac, empanadas. Their lamb dish is really good too. I got a mixed plate of cookies for dessert, which was unremarkable."}
{"text":"Good food! The most delicious was the salmon ceviche - please do yourself a favour and order this dish! The guacamole was good too, along with the empanadas. But the real standout was the salmon ceviche. We didn't love the octopus. I enjoyed my guava marguarita. My only complaint was that the service was slow. It may have been our particular waiter, as it did not appear as though the other tables were being served slowly. The waiter took an abnormally long time to take our order, but the food came out quickly, which was good because we were starving. I ordered the  ice cream and sorbet for dessert! A good way to end the meal. I think my expectations were so high because I had heard such amazing things from everyone, but I am not sure the restaurant was that spectacular. It was solidly good. Although as I mentioned above, the salmon ceviche is spectacular. That is the dish to order!  3.5/5 - too bad I can't give half stars"}
{"text":"I'll have to admit, I didn't have big expectations coming into this place, but I really liked Los Colibris. Being in the entertainment district where most restaurants are tourist-focused, I really didn't think it was going to be as good as it was. I dined with 5 other people and everyone was quite happy with their meal and the service provided.  I ordered the following: El Golondrino: rice tamal, lamb mixiote, chipotle-ancho adobo sauce, queso de hoja, salsa verde cruda  This was an excellent dish - I would definitely recommend it. The lamb literally would melt in your mouth. I suggest adding the hot sauce that accompanies it - spicy but flavourful...  My dinner companions ordered the below items and all had very positive things to say about them:  Chipotle Arrachera con Frijoles -  chipotle marinated flat iron steak, pico de gallo, refried black beans, chorizo sausage, handmade corn tortillas  El Jardin de Wookie - roasted seasonal vegetables in tlatonile and mole sauces  Pescado en Pipian Rojo y Berros - daily whole fish (served filleted), pipian rojo, pickled beets, celery root, watercress and crispy papas bravas  Additionally, their guacamole was really good as well..."}
{"text":"Steak taco was my favourite one tonight (it was only $1 if you purchased a beer) guacamole is delicious and great for sharing. I also tried the Pork taco and shrimp taco both good. Cocktails are awesome but a bit pricey if you're going to catch a buzz ;)"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner on recommendation from a foodie and it was very pleasant. We had to give our table back at a certain time and they were rushing us at the beginning but later on made a different arrangement and apologized.   Service was great. The staff was patient and friendly. Our waitress Sasha was very cheerful and had a great knowledge about wine.  Food is what made it 4/5. Though good, it was missing something to give it the full 5 star experience. Overall the decor is nice, service is great but the taste is lacking slightly."}
{"text":"This seems to be a very trendy restaurant in the heart of the entertainment district. I saw the trend but I didn't get it. There were several issues with this meal from my perspective......  The food itself was very tasty but just not to MY taste. Lots of flavour profiles that didn't suite MY palette. It was served very elegantly but that's were it ended for me. The chef clearly works hard at delivering a quality meal but it's lost with the poor service quality.  Our first server was stone faced & completely lacked a sense of humour. He dropped our table & we were happy he did! Our other servers were a little bit better. The female server was delightful but made several mistakes. She combined 2 different types of wine into a guests glass, we were served cold cappuccino's, they made a mess of the table with wine drips & in general the we felt like we were more of a bother then a valued cash paying guest.   In all fairness they DID try & make up for the missteps by comping a portion of a bottle of wine & a no charge dessert!!   All in all this was a less then enjoyable experience for me."}
{"text":"Food was really good and the service impeccable. We had the ceviche the house speciality the Rajas poblanos and the whole fish. The ceviche was really good, probably the top 5 ceviche in the city. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, incredible food, and good ambiance. We've all had \"mexican\" food before but this is the first time I've had authentic mexican. The quality and taste of each entree were incredible. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant.  High end by super food.  We had the duck for two.  Heart of entertainment district.  Apparently they have a more casual cheaper place below but have not tried it yet."}
{"text":"Los Colibris is an upscale mexican restaurant. The interior of the restaurant is very classy and professional. We made a reservation for dinner on a weekday and was seated right away. I love how all the tables are spaced out.  As people who grew up in Canada, none of us knew how to speak spanish, so it took us a bit of time to read the menu and understand what's going on. We bothered our server couple times (twice) regarding the menu and it seemed like she was annoyed by how long we were taking to decide - it was all so obvious on her face and how she worded everything.  We finally decided on the Empanadas, Picaditas de Pulpo (octopus), Tacos de Rajas Poblanas (chicken tacos), and Carnitas de Pato (duck). I have to say, every dish stood out on its own. The Empanadas was beautifully made, the octopus meat was massive, the spices used in the chicken were on point, and the duck was very tender.  We then ordered the Churros icecream for dessert, which was also mind blowing.  Unfortunately our server barely gave our table any attention.  I love this place and as much as I like mexican street food, this place is amazing. I would definitely have given it a 5 star if our server did not have a terrible attitude."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. First \"upscale\" mexican restaurant i've been to in toronto - it may be the only one in toronto. The decor is classic (white table cloths, older furniture), not trendy. The crowd was typically older...\"theater\" crowd i suppose.   The front of house was kinda cold/unfriendly. Maybe because I wasn't dressed up? I was in a field jacket, jeans and sneakers. She told me she could only seat me if i left by a certain time. Why do restaurants threaten their guests like that. Are you really going to kick me out mid bite? I'm not one to linger... I'm out the door as fast as you can feed me.   The waiter was super nice and explained how the menu worked, what is popular, and what his favorites were.   We got the: Rajas Poblanas, Chilies en Nogada, El Golondrino. All were very good. The portions were huge so we were extremely full.   The rajas poblanos was cream and had a kick. Portion is big enough to be an entree. Its super rich, so its good to share. The chilies en nogada was very tasty, though a bit too sweet for me, and i usually like sweet and salty food. The el golondrino is a lamb tamale, and was my favorite dish of the night. Overall the food was delicious and waitstaff were very friendly and makes up for the weird start.   When we left an hour and 15 minutes later the restaurant was pretty empty."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Very nice warm atmosphere. The waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable. We loved the food and the thing that impressed me the most was at the end of our meal the manager came over to our table to introduce herself. I mentioned that I tried one of their dishes at the Second Harvest Food Festival and she asked if that was one of the dishes we had as an appetizer. I wasn't sure what the dish was called so she went out of her way to ask me for my name and number to keep in their computer system along with a note that will prompt the waitress to recommend this dish next time I come in. I was so impressed with this!! I will definitely be back and I hope that you will try it as well."}
{"text":"I'm just unhappy with my experience in this restaurant !! I'm a Mexican so for me it was just sad I didn't found any Mexican flavour, the chef is from my house town but also I'm a Chef I had chorizo and steak it test just plain nothing different beans was to salty and the salsa macha I make it at home , my fiancé had Cordero lamb it was very salty the manager ask me how was the food and I said it was just ok she ask me why and I told her the food is Canadian stile it has nothing to do with Mexican everything  we had has been change there is not a Mexican flavour the price is to hight !! Is just sad , if I want to eat Indian food it have Indian food I love then because they don't change the Indian flavours ! Mexican culinary is just amazing the beauty of my country is that every single state has own dish you never eat the same food whatever you go Veracruz has a really good dishes and I didn't see any of then in 's  I won't go back and even the place itself is good and the service wonderful I can't not recommend to any of my friend because there is no Mexican food! There is a small place in Duffering and Bloor called Tierra Azteca you will be surprise with what they have a real Mexican food and good price but no fancy :("}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food, try the tortilla soup, you'll be happily surprised!   Best Chile en Nogada in town!"}
{"text":"This was a last minute reservation and luckily we got it and it was one of the best service I had in Toronto resturant. We were asked 8 times how we r doing and made us feel really important. And let's not forget about the food. Each Mexican inspired plate was great on its own, from meat dish to vegetarian dish, everything were prepared perfectly. I also love the homemade gelato/sorbet with interesting flavors like spiced chocolate and sour sop! Yum! Overall an surprisingly great experience because its so new and refreshing!  Price is very reasonable considering the location and quality of the food/service.   I would come and try more stuff here again soon!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and the decor was trendy, but the food leaves more to be desired. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I have always been skeptical of this place because of the location. I typically don't indulge in tourist area food. Regardless I had heard a lot of good things about it so off we went. I had the poblano chicken app which was in big pretty much what you would get at Casey's or something. Then I had the steak with I think guajillo. The paste was so thick and not nearly seasoned enough. It was kind of off putting. The husband didn't really enjoy his lamb shank much either and he is a huge fan of lamb. I would add here just for added info that I have eaten at many Mexican restaurants and my know leg of the food is broader than tacos so that is not why I didn't enjoy it. It just doesn't measure up when it comes to upscale Mexican."}
{"text":"We called last minute for a reservation of 7 people for a birthday party.  We arrived at 5:30 and They were able to take us but we have to give the table back at 7:30.    We were a bit rushed to get seated, order our apps and mains.  The food arrived quickly with good service.  This was my first time being exposed to finer Mexican food so I have nothing to compare to.  Not what I typically expect from Mexican foods. Those being tacos, rice beans etc.   I felt the food was nicely platted with fine touches.  Most of the dishes are spicy so avoid small children.  The deserts were spectacular!

{"text":"The service at this gourmet restaurant is FIVE star!! Upon checking in on yelp I also received a FREE large Chicken with cheese and peppers with four tortillas appetizer (going to write every thing in English because my Spanish is not all that well)...I ordered the tortilla soup, also Chicken with Chocolate Sesame Seed sauce and rice for my entrée...All I have to say is everything was finger licking GOOD...it is on a pricey side with all mains ranging in the high $20s and $30s but it is worth the experience!! Yum!"}
{"text":"I had been really excited to try this place out...but of course an occasion was required. My friend booked us in for a friends birthday. Service was fabulous-thank you Jim aka Bradly Cooper The Drinks were divine and pretty with accented flowers. The Cod Ceviche was nice with two types of chips the potatoes were rather unique with almost a curry paste sauce. For my main I had the Tagliatelle pasta with sautéed mushrooms - tooo die for. My friends ordered dessert and were very satisfied. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"4 stars for the dessert but everything else was just OK. Food didn't wow me and I'd rather spend my 50 bucks on some tacos elsewhere.  Tip: Checking into Yelp gets you a free app - it was a chicken filling taco that comes with 4 tortillas (Tacos de Rajas Poblanas at $18 on the menu)  APPETIZERS:  Salmon Ceviche ($14) - I didn't like it but some of my friends did - Mix of salmon and frozen grapes and apple  Guacamole and Chips ($11.50) - Comes with taro and regular chips - Good basic app with decent portion of guac  Shrimp (Camarones a la Diabla, $17) - This was cooked well, portioned as 5 shrimps - I liked this best out of everything  MAINS:  Pork (Chiles en Nogata, $29) - I really didn't like this one - It had a sweet flavour but not in a good way  Beef Steak (Arrachera, $28) - The minced bits (think it was chorizo and beans) at the bottom were incredibly salty - Even the actual steak was also very heavily salted  My friends got the duck confit and the house special steak at $26 and $48. They seemed to be better.  DESSERT:   Carrot Cheesecake Panna Cotta  Both were well plated and pretty good. They add some small touches to each dessert for presentation but I think simplicity would've been better. For example, in the panna cotta were some cereal-esque chunks that I think the dessert would've been better without. That being said, after the terrible mains, the dessert was greatly welcomed.  SEATING: Pretty big space and quite nice Some normal tables and some booths as well  SERVICE: Service was great! Staff were very friendly and quick to requests. They brought out sharing plates and whatnot to accommodate our group.  Overall, I was disappointed in the food and wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"If I said it once, I'll say it again. Stop writing Yelp reviews if you frequent Applebee's for your birthday every year. Four stars for this place is deceptively high. Once again, an entertainment district restaurant has lured us in and then subsequently disappointed us.   Let's start with the tequila list. For a high end Mexican restaurant, I have a larger variety in my own bar. I did, however, order the Mañana tequila because it was the only one I hadn't tried. It was aggressive, full of agave but finished with a nice anise flavour. My girlfriend ordered the Fin de Dias, described as tequila reposado, campari, agave, pale ale floater and grapefruit zest. I found the drink to be boring, lacking complexity and could have been swapped with a tequila and grapefruit going undetected.   We ordered two appetizers: the chicken tinga empanada and the queso fundido. The empanada was delicious overall, but much improvement could have been made, even with a simple plating change. Stacking them on top of each other then pouring the sauce on top of that caused the steam and sauce to make them soggy. With the queso fundido, it was...queso fundido. So like, yeah cheese and pork meat. It's fucking good. Duh. But no ingenuity. Maybe a blend of goat cheeses for tartness or some sort of acidic garnish to cut the fat on your palette? No no! Not at Los Colibris.    Now the entree. We ordered the Chilies en Nogada. Upon arrival, the dish was not visually appealing. The first thing that stuck out were the large, asymmetrical, semi-cooked red peppers. I detest inedible garnishes and for me, a raw pepper at a restaurant of this calibre is inedible (the skin is very bitter and should be roasted off). I took an initial taste of the raw walnut sauce. It was gritty, overwhelmingly seasoned with cinnamon and entirely too sweet. We then proceeded to cut open the pepper. Everything appeared muddled, which in turn made it taste muddled. With the meat that I could find, I think the pork was broken down into chunks, which is not, in my experience, what picadillo is (it's typically ground). Like the sauce, it was cloyingly sweet. Ultimately the dish had to be sent back, with much apology from the staff who I found to be extremely attentive.   As we reviewed the menu to order an alternative, we realized it wouldn't have been worth the wait or the risk. We ordered our dessert to go and paid the tab. The dessert was yummy, which I devoured on my couch after we left. Mexican style bunuelos with guava and dulce de leche ice creams, which were yummy.   I know this review sounds brutal. The dishes weren't BAD. They were just ok. But for the price range of this restaurant, they were totally unjustified and my intention is simply to forewarn future patrons."}
{"text":"My mother in law made reservations here far in advance for a Wednesday night and we had no problem getting our table or finding the resturant. We started the meal with chicken and vegetarian empanadas. While the chicken ones were so so the vegetarian (mushroom based) were much better. We ordered two of each without knowing the size and we probably could've done with only one each since they are large in size. When it came time to order we went with queso fundido, cornbread brisket (not sure the actual name), and a shrimp dish.  Queso fundido- This was SO watery. The queso was great but the pico de Gallo had so much juice that my fresh flour tortillas got soggy. I'm also not sure this would have filled me up without previously eating the empanadas. Cornbread brisket- This seemed to be the star of the meal. The portion was decent and there were multiple pieces of corn bread on top of brisket that was hidden in a sauce. I would recommend this dish. Shrimp dish-Hard pass. I honestly expected this to be great and the portion was so small the person who ordered it needed to order more food. Miss and pass.  We also ordered some papas bravos but they didn't come out until the end of the meal even though they were a side. Once we reminded the server I think he realized they never got entered into the order. They were great but a little sauce heavy, I would recommend them.  We ordered margaritas- regular and guava mango. They were super tasty and I would definitely order them again without issue. I do wish that my guava mango would've been a sugar rim instead of salt though.   We finished with two types of desserts, a churro ice cream sandwich with dulce de leche ice cream and a carrot cake cheesecake. Both of these were disappointing. I love dessert and we didn't finish either of them. The churro sandwich was so greasy and that's all we could taste. The carrot cake cheesecake had so many components that it didn't really mesh well. I was sad to end the meal on a sour note.   I will say the service was on point. Friendly and paid attention to when we needed dishes cleared or more to drink. We were informed that the menu (while small) changes with the seasons. I would maybe think about coming when there's another menu but probably not with the current one"}
{"text":"Classy Mexican food. Food was a little overpriced for what you're getting. I ordered the duck confit dish. Three rolled up tortilla containing the duck meat arrived. Tortilla wraps were okay, some were burnt/crispy near the edges... whereas everything else was getting soggy because it was soaked in the sauce. You might think the duck inside was the prize, but unfortunately it was also rather dry and lacking flavor.   For dessert, I got the coffee panna cotta. It was one of the best desserts I've had in a while, well plated with all the different elements mixed in together. The highlight here was the horchata ice cream.   I won't come back for dinner since the food did not justify the high price point -  el caballito downstairs can fill you up with half the price and all the flavor. However, I would recommend stopping by for the drinks and dessert options.  Tip: Also got a free appetizer (Rajas Poblanas) because I checked in on yelp. It was flavorful and had a nice spicy kick."}
{"text":"Sat in their lounge so my friend and I only didn't try their entrees but their appetizers were some of the best I've ever had.   We had the rajas poblanas, tostada de atun, camarones a la diabla, guaraches de pulpo en su tinta, and el golondrino.  The rajas poblanas is very creamy and cheesy with lots of onions and chunks of chicken. Love the cherry consistency of the flour tortillas that accompany the dish. I was told this is one of their heavier appetizers. I must say that it is quite filling.   Tostada de atun has an amazing avocado cream and the tuna is tender and flavorful.   The guaraches de pulpo en su tinta has an amazing sauce with an arm of octopus. Octopus was firm and the piece was bigger than expected.   El golondrino has very tender lamb with a mild to moderate gamy flavour.   Very relaxing and classy atmosphere. Great place to sit and chat with friends."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious and was thoroughly impressed! Service is impeccable! Better than many other fine dinning places I've experienced. The food was delicious. Lots of flavour. Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food. I was so thrilled with my experience here. I came here for my Anniversary with my husband. We loved seeing the open kitchen. The service was exceptional. We were seating with a smile and throughout our whole dining experience taken care of. The drinks were excellent. We had the ceviche to start and it was so tasty! I got the enchiladas and my husband got duck and both were delicious! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious with a friend and we had an amazing experience.  We got the Pozole Rojo de Pollo & Ceviche to start. Pollo Zapata & Pescado a la Veracruzana con Arroz Blanco for the mains. Finished off with  Capirotada aka  a Mexican Bread pudding.   The  ambiance of the restaurant was quite good with paintings, music and decor that made you feel like you were  inside a Mexican Villa. The servers were excellent and explained each menu item clearly and recommended lots of items from the desserts and drinks menu.   The food was excellent. My friend found the Rojo de Pollo very flavorful with just the right amount of spice . I also found the fish very flavorful   with the Veracruz sauce complementing the fish very well and not taking its flavor away.  One aspect that I enjoyed was that they have an open  concept kitchen where we could see the owner working with her team to prepare the  tasty food.  From what we saw it was run very effectively with no issues.  My one concern with the restaurant and  an ongoing one at many restaurants is the level of lighting. The lighting  was a bit dim and  as foodies we prefer  bright lighting so we can take pictures of the amazing food.   We will be back for  the regular menu items as well as a licious down the line ."}
{"text":"I came with a group of friends to sample the winterlicious menu. Service was very good and very attentive. There was never an empty cup at our table. The decor was simple and nice however it is insanely dark and a little more lighting would not come amiss.  We ordered a few starters off of the winterlicious menu.  Ceviche Blanco: Nice light flavors. The coconut flavor is mild but interesting. It comes with an assortment of chips to eat with. I particularly like the taro chips. Overall I think the flavors were a bit too mild for a ceviche, though the freshness of flavor was there. Mediocre.  Ceviche Traditional: I liked this better. It had a punchier flavor than the blanco and a better balance of flavors.  For the winterlicious menu:  Empanadas de Tinga: (Chicken Empanadas) Moist filling with a crispy shell. It was good. Compared to the other dishes, this wasn't plated as nicely but it was satisfying.  Pozole de Cerdo y Camaron: (Pulled Pork Soup) Hearty punchy flavors with a mild heat. The flavors get a bit redundant with a few spoons though.  Ropa Vieja: (Brisket) Hearty but the portion was smaller than could really be considered an entree. It was beautifully displayed though.  Albondigas en Adobo: (Turkey Meatballs) Moist and juicy with a flavorful sauce. This was a nicer portion.  Ice cream: There were two flavors; dulce de leche & mango and passion fruit. The mango and passion fruit was very tart but I like sour. Even so, the dulce de leche was even better, so creamy and smooth.  Cake: This wasn't on the winterlicious menu however the day we came in it was being offered so we opted for this option. The cake was a thick kind of sponge that was very thick, sweet, and moist. It is a little on the heavier side but has lighter flavors.  Overall, I think the food was okay. The presentation was beautiful, the service was very good and attentive. Would I come back here again? Probably not. For the price of the food to the quality, I was not wowed, or that impressed. Los Colibris strikes me as a restaurant that tries too hard to impress with the pretty, not so much the quality of the food. The flavor profiles of the food left me saying \"meh\" at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here in my recent visit to Toronto. This place serves upscale Mexican cuisine in a pretty dining room. The only downside was how hot the restaurant was the day we were there. Service was very friendly from hostess to server. Our server was very engaging and knowledgable about the food and helped explained all the dishes and ingredients.  The soups are delicious here! The Sopa Del Dia ($9) or soup of the day was unbelievable good. It was a chicken broth soup with shredded chicken that had so many layers of flavour. Another great dish though a bit on the higher price range for a lunch is the Chipotle Arrachera con Frijoles ($26) chipotle marinated flat iron, pico de gallo, refried black beans, chorizo sausage. The entire dish was good but the refried black beans were phenomenal. I didn't love the fried cheese nest on top as it tasted a bit rubbery and was not crunchy as expected. Otherwise, the chorizo was very flavourful and paired with the flat iron steak.  Sopa de Tortilla ($9) - chicken, avocado, panela, chipotle soup was good though the soup of the day (above) won hands down.   I had a lovely lunch here and would come back!"}
{"text":"Come here for Summerlicious dinner w the BFF on a Friday night.   Ambiance- formal white table cloth and romantic; dim w an archway reminiscent of small restaurants I visited in Spain; open kitchen in the back. Nice lounge in front for drinks   Food - meh. Ceviche starter was bland and needed acid. It wasn't balanced and too fishy. We agreed it was a Good serving size w great chips but the ceviche wasn't the best. I  got the pork dinner w pineapple salsa. Although the pineapple salsa added brightness to the plate and the meat was tender, the dish was a bit one dimensional and lacked depth of flavour. It was all one texture and didn't wow me. My friend got the fish entree and she felt like the fish was overcooked.  Dessert we got churros and a tres dolce cake. The churros were short and too doughy. Disappointing. The cake had a nice sorbet on it but the cake was dry and nothing special.   Service -excellent. Pure server was polite and attentive.   Beautiful restaurant but the food didn't wow me. The food wasn't back, just not stellar. I love Mexican and food so it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Had Winterlicious lunch here and was impressed. The servers were pleasant and knowledgeable, the food was super tasty. Black bean soup - lots of texture with tortilla strips and some heat from macha oil; chilaquiles with chicken, mashed avocados, corn chips and two fried eggs on top; churros for dessert.   So good, I'm definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food was outstanding, the waiters were attentive and polite. We came here For summerlicious, often the food during this event is never amazing because it's produced is sub mass. However, this food was delicious some Of my favourite Mexican food.   I got the enchiladas in a red sauce, I usually stick to green salsa I love the taste of tomatillos! So I was hesitant when I only say a red sauce available, however I love enchiladas so I got it anyway. Their sauce was amazing and flavourful and the chicken was juicy.   We got churros for dessert, I personally don't love churros but their's were pretty dam good."}
{"text":"Guacomole is small but beautifully presented. We ordered two. Has pomegranate in it and It's delicious. I think the nachos that are served with it are house made. They are very crunchy.  I commented in passing about the size and the manager comped me another. The pulpo was a hit with M. the salad was good, pomegranate and candied ginger definitely kick it up.  For mains; the stuffed poblano was the most favored at our table. Then the pollo rollado (sp?), then the halibut. The halibut was mild and very tasty. For dessert, try the bunuelos, tres leches, or chocolate flan. And to top it off, the ladies appreciated the washroom!"}
{"text":"Great design & great service! There were also private spaces for groups. We went there 9 ppl on a Monday night and sat in the private space in front of the windows. It was a great experience overall. It's also worth mentioning that our waiter took out 2 of the main courses from the menu when they didnt come as expected."}
{"text":"The food was average, for a high scale Mexican place. If you're looking for reaL Mexican, go to a hole in the wall instead. At the prices you're paying for the food here, it's simply not worth it.  The service was upsetting because while most of the servers were very nice, everything was incredibly slow to come out. They told us we had 2 hours to eat because they're going away our table but they didn't serve our main course until 1.5 hours later."}
