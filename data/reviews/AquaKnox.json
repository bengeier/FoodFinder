{"text":"My husband and I were in Las Vegas for the weekend and decided to have some oysters at AquaKnox before Valentine's Day dinner.  This was our second time dining at this restaurant.  The first time was okay but overpriced.  We ordered a dozen oysters at the bar.  The oysters came out quickly and my husband was about to eat the first when both of us noted something black squirming in the oyster.  Upon closer inspection it was a black worm about a centimeter long.  It was moving very quickly so we called over the bartender to show him.  He did see it and took the oyster and quickly threw it away and left the rest of the oysters.  We let him know that we did not want the rest of the oysters and he then took them away.  He left the bar area for a few minutes (probably to let someone know what happened).  Upon his return, no apology, just asked if we wanted something else.  We didn't.  It probably took us about 15 minutes to finish our drinks.  During that time no apology from anyone at the restaurant.  On our way out I asked to see the manager to let him know what happened and he smiled and said he already knew.  We let him know that we at least expected an apology and he said that the bartender should have apologized.  He went over to the bartender and said something to him.  The bartender got irate and said first to us \"what do you want me to do, I didn't charge you for the oysters\".  He then said to his manager that he apologized 3 times.  A complete fabrication.  Not sure if I'm eating raw oysters anymore, but what I can say is that we will never return to AquaKnox."}
{"text":"Had the crab legs, tomato salad and the sea bass.  The crab legs were good because they were pre-cracked.  The sea bass was served with the head and tail.  It is not Chilean sea bass and was not that great.  

The service was really really slow.  We had a large group, 16 people, but it took over three hours.  The seats are really formal and the wait staff could not reach over the seats to get or pick up food, so they hit my chair every time.  

There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas that are much better."}
{"text":"Buyer's and Eater's Remorse!!!

The Good
Five Stars for the service - The service was impeccable! We have had, as good, but never better service in over thirty years eating in fine dining restaurants.

Five stars for my wife's dinner - My wife had the Georges Bank Scallops. She always orders scallops if they are on the menu. She said they were perfectly cooked and the accompanying sides were as tasty as those she had at Roy's and the SW Steakhouse in the Wynn.   

The Bad
Two stars for ambiance - They crammed as many tables and chairs into the space as possible. I am not a large person and I barely had enough room to move my chair back to get in and out. The tables and chairs on each side of the walkways to allow diners into and out of the restaurant and the wait staff room to get around the restaurant were very close to each other. I could have easily leaned over and touch the chair next to me across the walkway. The music was too loud for a fine dining restaurant.

Two stars for my dinner. I had the AquaKnox Fish Soup. The John Dory was overcooked, one of the clams and one of the oysters were no bigger than the nail on my little finger and the lobster was overcooked and very tiny. I have had perfectly cooked and a much larger lobster tails in a similar dish at Roy's and even Red Lobster! A real shame because the broth was to die for.

Two stars for menu variety and creativity - I had a very difficult time finding a starter to go with my Fish Soup. Almost every starter contained some element in the Fish Soup so I just ordered the boring Romaine Salad and my wife did the same. The menu is uninspired and insipid. The appetizer \"Special\" was steamed crab legs with drawn butter. I wonder how long it took them to develop that dish! Anyone can buy crab legs from the grocery store, warm them and melt butter on the side. When we go out to eat in a fine dining restaurant we expect the only problem with the menu to be too many interesting and enticing choices, not too few! Check out the online menus for the Chart House and Roy's, both upscale seafood restaurants also in Las Vegas, for examples of truly inspired and creative offerings.

The Bottom Line
Two stars for a disappointing experience and a case of \"Buyer's and Eater's Remorse\"! If you are a local in Las Vegas, much better choices are The Chart House in the Golden Nugget and Roy's - a short eight minute drive to Flamingo Road from the Venetian. Either restaurant has far more convenient valet or self parking.   If you are from out of town and without a car, the extra expense for a cab ride to either restaurant is advised."}
{"text":"Amazing, 5 star experience. What can I say, the Oysters were excellent, I never expected seafood would be so good anywhere in a desert location, but it was.  The wine the Expert recommend was very good! I wish I could remember the cocktail waitresses name, but she was fantastic and funny, such a people person.  All I all it was terriffic, ambiance was also very nice.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is one where you really want to like the place as the service was super and the atmosphere was nice... but the food.. was a 2 - meh, I've had better...  overall 3-stars because the service was 5-star but we came for the food... I just don't have the energy to go into more about this place - cuz well... meh..."}
{"text":"Reservation is very flexible. Very pricey food; though fish is fresh. Slow service. Restaurant serves bread sticks with a small plate of dip rather than real bread with butter."}
{"text":"The AquaKnox is located in the Venetian area.  We had a party of three.  The first thing we noticed was that the waiters work in a pair, which was interesting.  We ordered a bottle of wine recommended by our waiters, which worked well with the food and was decently priced.  We started off with an amuse bouche, which was basically a bite sized caprese salad, which was delicious, but not particularly all that creative.  We split the platter as an appetizer, which was a ridiculous amount of food.  Had we had just the platter and dessert, all of us would have left happy and full.  There were oysters, crab, mussels, shrimp, lobster, oyster shooters, and we got the other crab upsell.  I would say that the shrimp ceviche was really disappointing as the shrimp was rubbery and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  The stone crab however was delicious.  I got the lobster stuffed with crab and holy crap was that a huge lobster -- at least a 2.5 pounder.  Next time, I'm definitely going to ask how big it is.  It however didn't go to waste as I just took it home and ate it as lunch the next day (as an aside: I asked them to crack everything and they told me they did.  The claws were kinda cracked, but kinda half assed so I had to leave a lot of meat in the claw because I couldn't get to it at work).  My father had the prawns which were tasty and my husband had the yellowfin which was also delicious.  I'm not really sure if the dining experience really merited the price, but the seafood was definitely very fresh.  I guess I felt they relied very heavily on the top quality nature of their seafood instead of any real creativity in the cooking and flavoring.  Oherwise, as top notch of a dining experience that you can get in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood collection with even better customer service.  I have had several items but my favorite has to me Alaskan king crab cakes and Japannese Bass Barramundi and chocolate souffl√© cake.  You can top it off with their wonderful cappuccino or better yet a home made chocolate chip cookie with raspberry cream."}
{"text":"I definitely do not like seafood but according to my friends they enjoyed it. What I really enjoyed was the nice atmosphere this place had. Sat at the bar and had a few beers. The Bartender which I did not get her name was on her game. Very busy and she managed to take care of me and my guest. Keep it up"}
{"text":"Best seafood that I've ever had in Las Vegas & probably on of the best seafood places that I've ever eaten in my life. 

The service was seamless & just flowed very nicely. Everyone was very cordial & polite, as well as hilarious & earthy. Our server kept us entertained the entire evening. 

The food was impeccable! First they start you out with a salmon pate type thing & breadsticks. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Then we ordered a lobster bisque, which very silky & flavorful- THE GREATEST LOBSTER BISQUE EVER! After that we had a seafood platter of oysters on the half shell, prawns, lobster, ceviche & shooters- really a great deal for $80, serving 2 people. Our main courses were so delicious, we had to conquer them- despite how full we were from the previous courses. I got the John Dory which was server recommended & I am so happy I listened. Very versatile piece of fish; crunchy, savory, sweet. It was served over a lobster succatash, who doesn't like their food being served over lobster?! Last, but certainly not least- DESSERT! We got the Apple Tarte Tatin- caramelly apples with salted caramel ice cream, count me in!

I would give AquaKnox 10 stars if I could- everything was so wonderful & so was everyone. My girlfriend & I can't wait to go back & try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Very good sushi but not the best.. the presentation and the scenery makes this place more that it could be.. The crab cakes are amazing and the grilled ahi tuna is beautifully presented and very good."}
{"text":"This place hands down has given me the best meal I have ever had. The crab stuffed lobster was incomparable. The service was perfect and even the bartender added to the evening with perfect martinis. 

Like another yelper, I was concerned that I was able to get reservations within a few hours unlike some of the other restaurants I tried before here, but thank goodness for that. I have a new \"must go\" on my Vegas trip itinerary."}
{"text":"While the food is generally good, it's very expensive and should be cooked to perfection.  Last time I ate here the food was over cooked and rubbery.  My water class had a film on it.  The servers were great but they constantly were rushing us to order.  The food came out within minutes of ordering and was overlooked and not very warm.  This makes me wonder if it's pre prepared.   At these prices that is unforgivable.  If you're looking for a leisurely meal stay away from here.   The appetizers were the best part of the meal, hence the three stars.  This may be my last trip here."}
{"text":"We were happy with dinner here. For the price point here we found this to be the best value of other options in this range. Staff was helpful and not over pushy, upselling was not to the extent we have found at other places.

Seafood soup was awsome. 

very nice dining experence here"}
{"text":"All I have to say is try the oyster shooters and John Dory.  One of my favorite places to dine in Vegas.  Service is always great.  Food is better."}
{"text":"I had the \"butterfish\", which was pretty good, but had a weird consistency that I wasn't crazy about. I remember the flavor being good, and all that accompanied it, and that the party I was with seemed quite taken with their selections. I recall that someone ordered some kind of steak and they were out, which I thought was kind of weak. Also, I had to order my second drink (cocktail) like 3 times over 30 minutes before they finally brought it out, so that was disappointing."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday. It was our first time here and we loved it. The service was the best I've had In a while. The food was fantastic! Beautiful atmosphere! They even brought out a little birthday dessert with two shots. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"if you're a seafood restaurant and manage to botch up a raw seafood platter, something is very very wrong. half the food on ice just did not impress not to mention the ridiculous prices they charged for it. decor was gorgeous though, don't get me wrong...but if you're looking for fresh seafood go somewhere else. this place is a total rip off."}
{"text":"Just had drinks here.....

Beautiful, beautiful restaurant tucked away out of the way in the Venetian (like Bouchon where you aren't amidst the hussle and bussle).  The signature martini with blue raspberry is unbelievable.  The bar service was ok, a little short and unfriendly.  I would recommend Aquaknox for a chill spot to grab a drink or two."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Me and my girl went here for Valentines day and wow!! The service and the food was amazing! I recommend anyone going there to try the stuffed crab Maine lobster."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant with a group of 12 people while we were on a business trip.  The decor was beautiful, and the service was good.  At the end of the night, we asked the server to split our tickets.  We were reimbursed by showing the company our individual receipts. (sucks)  However, the server told us that he can't split the tickets for us.  So, one person had to pay for everything, and the other people would pay to that particular person.  This was very annoying because we each had to make a copy of the receipt, and initial our names by what we ordered.  This whole process took a long time, and a couple of people sitting next to us started to make condescending comments toward us.  For example, they said to us,\"If you don't have any money, then don't eat at this fancy restaurant.\"  I thought to myself, \"what a bunch of idiots!  They had no idea what we were doing and what we were annoyed about.  At the end of the night, I left the restaurant with a bad taste in my mouth. 

If you are eating with a group of 4 or more, and you have to split the tickets for reimbursement.  Don't go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!!

I cannot believe what a wonderful experience we had at AquaKnocks.  Our server Luke was extremely knowledgeable and attentive and we knew we in for a treat the moment we tasted the lobster bisque.  The next course was the shrimp and crab salad followed by the scallops entree.  Our entire meal was incredible. This is the best seafood I have had in Vegas.

Two thumbs up.!!!"}
{"text":"What what only 3.5 stars for this place?!?! Blasphemy!!!

This place was definitely one of the highlights of my weekend Vegas trip with the boyfriend.  Actually, it's one of the best fine dining experience that I've ever had!!! The food was absolutely AMAZING and the service was excellent !! 

Upon arriving at the restaurant, we were promptly seated at the booths, and I'm glad we were, because the area's really quite romantic. The decor is just beautiful and the whole vibe of the restaurant was just great. Lovee the blue drapes that were hanging down from above. 

After placing our order, the waitress brought out a vase of breadsticks, along with smoked salmon sauce. The smoked salmon was really, really delicious. After finishing the breadsticks I just  had to finish the rest of the salmon. yummy. 

We ordered the seafood plateau ($80), an appetizer  consisting of shrimp, raw clams, 6 raw oysters, oyster shooters, and lobster. ALL of the items were extremely fresh and delicious, especially the oysters, the clams, and the lobster. I also like the fact that the cocktail sauce had horseradish in it to give the overall thing an extra kick. Delicious. After the slowly enjoying each and every item on the plate, we were pretty happy and satisfied with the meal, but the best was yet to come!

Next came the house salad ($11). It's a nice and simple dish that was arranged quite nicely on the plates.and was quite refreshing to have after the seafood appetizer.  

As an entree, we had the surf and turf, which was split between the two of us. I was quite surprised at how much food they gave us. We each had our own little steak (4 oz or a maybe little more?) and lobster (bf got the tail and I the claws). I must say... the steak's probably the second best I've ever had [after the bf's. but his steak can't be beat ;) Tender AND flavorful!!!  ] . The meat was nicely seasoned and just melted in our mouths. The lobster was equally amazing, if not better than the steak ! I thought that it was nice that they brought out a nice little contraption that kept the butter warm for us. But yes. The food was just sooo good...  and I was sooo happy when I was eating the entree haha. (We also ordered champagne, so that probably contributed to my overly happy state at the time as well. Oh, wine bottles are half off on Sunday! )

After the meal, we were pretty darn satisfied, so we didn't order dessert. They brought us some little butter cookies, and I thought that was a nice gesture from them. 

The food's definitely not wallet friendly (total came out to 250, exc tax), but it's definitely something you need to try at least once when you're in Vegas. I will be back !!!! hopefully. After I do some gambling and make more moneys =)

Pictures uploaded!"}
{"text":"You know the saying, \"Reach for the stars!\" or \"Shoot over the moon!\" Well, this restaurant has definitely shot farther than the stars and moon!

I had the most fabulous and relaxing experience. I said experience. It wasn't just how flavorful and fresh the seafood was. I'm from Hawaii and we have the one of the best seafood dishes here, however this restaurant (and awesome chef) truly created a beautiful and orgasimic-euphoric dish. 

PROS:
1. Surf and turf. The stuffed lobster was perfect! I rarely eat steak because it doesn't taste appealing. BUT this was so amazing and I understood why people love steak! Haha. 

2. The seafood stew-cipionnio was the best ever broth. The seafood was bountiful and tender. I ordered it without the couscous. 

3. Most of all, the server was personable, but professional. He was so accommodating and respected our space as we took our time, laughed, and enjoyed the whole experience. The waters were always filled. The wait staff was smiling, friendly, and very attentive. 

4. Make a reservation for around 5:30pm. Why? Most kitchens are ready and eager to start cooking. Anytime after 6:30pm, usually kitchens are slammed. The noise level was quiet and we weren't rushed. 

You will enJOY your experience! I'm definitely coming back here when I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Aqua Knox as part of Las Vegas Restaurant Week.  Amazing restaurant-the service was impeccable.  Food outstanding.

We sampled both salads and both deserts offered-all were unique and very tasty. I had the Halibut which was cooked to perfection-moist and flaky.  My husband had the signature dish the Aqua Knox fish soup.  It was a delicious broth with a little spice, a little saffron and tons of shellfish..  Truly delicious.

The chef also presented us a tuna tartar appetizer and a pineapple/mango shooter with cupcake after desert.  A special offering for restaurant week.

All in all-excellent fresh seafood, service and dining experience."}
{"text":"This was our first time at AquaKnox.  It was first class all the way.  Jesse was our waiter; he did a fantastic job, as did the sommelier (a woman whose name escapes me right now).  The entire staff was fantastic."}
{"text":"I was told by a friend that this was the place to go when I had something special planned for the wife and he was right!!! We asked for a booth and the young lady had no problem giving it to us also They have an amazing staff the waiter was friendly I felt I could ask him anything about the wine and food and that didn't stop I know my wife can be picky sometimes so when she kept asking the young lady that served us our food for specific items the young lady was very nice about it .I feel like most restaurants won't do that and don't get me started on the food it was delicious everything tasted amazing try the surf and turf its to die for!! I enjoyed the quality of the food if you want a romantic dinner for 2 then this is the place to go!! I will be recommending this place to friends and family as well!!"}
{"text":"Dined here once.  Nothing stood out enough for me to remember other than the seafood platter, but who can screw up a cold seafood platter at this price point?  I'd rather chow down @ The Oyster Bar for my raw seafood fix."}
{"text":"Way overrated and overpriced. I had the scallops and lobster bisque for dinner. We also ordered 3 appetizers - crab cakes, king crab legs and the seafood trio. The seafood trio was pretty bad - terrible sauces that just made the seafood taste funky. The crab in the trio tasted bad to me or else the sauce just made it taste fishy and off. I didn't enjoy a single dish, so that's pretty bad. The service was fine but I didn't really care for the waiter. Definitely would not return. For 3 people it was over a $300 bill. Should've spent it gambling instead."}
{"text":"Girlfriends weekend out with a small group.  We often stop at AquaKnox for drinks and apps, but this time had full dinner, and it was great.

The wine service was helpful, we quizzed her about what would go well with our dining options (and of course everyone ordered something different, ranging from Ribeye to Halibut), we ended up with a really nice Pinot from Oregon.

Girlfriend had the seared scallops, and they were perfect.  I had the halibut and it was also cooked to perfection.  Our meat eating friend got the special of the night, I think it was lamb shank.  Too big for her (she is tiny) but she enjoyed what she did consume.  Another friend got the Ahi, and the chef really shows creativity with that dish.  For the table we ordered the pomme frietes and veggies, shared and loved by all.

On a previous occasion we went with another couple, who both ordered the lobster (crab stuffed) and it was a very generous portion, suitable for sharing.

Highly recommend, especially if you have a show nearby (we didn't but we love the Palazzo and the Venetian and \"restaurant row\" between them)."}
{"text":"Have been many times over years.  Recent trip, noticed service is still attentive, atmosphere is still nice; food has gone one step backward.

Had my usual lobster stuffed with crab meat; lobster much smaller than times past and price higher than times past.  Also had lobster bisque; it was just ok this time compared to times past.  This would have been my sixth or seventh time here in last few years, ordering the same; so I could compare to my previous experiences.

Better places for seafood in vegas with better prices!"}
{"text":"I only had a late night snack at the bar, crabcakes and wine. The crabcake app was excellent, the best crabcake I've ever had, and most expensive at 18 or so. It had virtually no filler, was cooked perfectly crispy on the outside, had nicely separate flavors from the greens garnish to the diced veggies underneath and the amazinng citrus aioli. 2 of them were small but filling enough for an app. 

Also had a chard by the glass from whatever was available on the limited menu for wine by glass and it too was excellent and would have paired well with many foods. 

My server at the bar was a little rushed, hasty, and seemed like she couldn't be bothered with a customer at first, but then she warmed up. 

Mixed reviews would turn me off to a full on dinner here but if you start off with the crabcakes you'll like that part."}
{"text":"Waterfalls and fountains, aqua and white, ultra chic and modern, fish and shellfish. This serene, and comfortable restaurant is sandwiched between many other fine dining restaurants, from French (Pinot Brasserie), whimsical and creative American cuisine (David Burke), to Emeril (Delmonico Steakhouse). Their prized seafood, flown in daily, is 80% of the dinner menu, also, boasts an expansive, wine list. The menu includes signature dishes, such as, the seafood plateau (enough for two).  The plateau includes, 3 mussels, 3 clams, 3 prawns, 2 crab claws, 6 oysters on a half shell, 2 oyster ponzu shooters, and a small dish of shrimp ceviche (side note: massive dish, prawns were shrimp, ponzu shooters were too sweet and might be a lil on the spicy side for the general public). The presentations of the John Dory with lobster stuccotash and sweet corn broth and Jumbo Louisana Prawns on a bed of curried forbidden black rice were aesthetically appealing, but a tad under-seasoned. Again, very fresh seafood. Dessert; Pear Frangipane with Vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce, garnished with a pear chip and a Mint Chocolate Cake with mint ice cream and a chocolate sauce, garnished with chocolate flutes, once again, aesthetically pleasing, although, the ice cream somewhere other than on top of the cake. The service was a roller coaster. Our server, somewhat disappeared and another server/food runner took over and saved her. Otherwise, a great dining experience.

{"text":"I've had the pleasure of dining at AquaKnox twice, and both experiences were outstanding. From the food, to the ambiance, to the service, AquaKnox does an excellent job at creating a memorable dining experience.

Here are a few of the dishes i highly recommend:

To start, I would definitely order the seafood trio. It consists of shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster cocktail, and blue crab cocktail with the house mustard sauce.  All three were delicious, but the blue crab was AMAZING! It was juicy & full of flavor. I would return just to have that crab! We also had a pot of clams (I can't remember the actual name of the dish) which was equally as delicious and flavorful.

As entrees we had the filet mignon and the John Dory. Again, both were great, but the John Dory was seriously superb. I'm usually a Chilean sea bass type of person, but I was pleasantly surprised by its great flavor. It was cooked to perfection - tender and juicy. This will definitely be my entree of choice if I get the chance to dine here again.

We did have dessert, which was very tasty, but I'm since not huge on dessert, many of them taste similar to me and thus don't really stand out. I will say, however, that their banana cake is probably the best I've ever had.

So, would I return? YES! Do I highly recommend? YES! In addition to excellent food, the staff was extremely friendly, not pretentious, and very knowledgable. If you're in Vegas and in the mood for seafood, you really need to give this place a try."}
{"text":"I've been this place yesterday with my family.
Someone was always smile to us and really friendly, so we were having a really good time by her favor.
We were three and I felt stomachache, and my aunt wasn't that hungry, so we order three and shared the dishes.
But suddenly the old man came to our table (seems like manager), he just took out our folks and knives and plates by saying that \"you guys are done, right?\" and he only left my spoon.
He seems that because we ordered dishes small amount, he was being freaking ruuuuude.

I really didn't want to give him tip, but our waitress was really nice so we gave her tip.
I hope it doesn't go to him..."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and the food is always great.  get the blue cheese salad(if you like blue cheese)  Something to eat for everyone"}
{"text":"This place definitely rates 4 or 5 for design and ambiance.  The ocean inspired deep blue motif is calming and assuring.  This review is actually just for the bar which I visited twice on last weeks trip, but I did have the pleasure to dine with Aquaknox this time last year.

I'm actually allergic to fin-fish (swimming fish as opposed to shell fish) so I'm probably not the guy to write a dining review.  The bar service is great and our waitress was spicy, friendly and on the ball.  There was definitely energy in the area but it was not too loud and at one point someone in our party got a little rowdy and other guests noticed/.  Not bad, just a sign that you can carry on a civilized conversation without straining your voice.

My recollections of last years meal are positive and the service at the bar this year was exceptional enough that I would definitely recommend this establishment whether you are on vacation with loved ones or friends; or on your way back from walking the Sands Expo floor with clients or co-workers.

Cheers Aquaknox - to a great experience!"}
{"text":"Wow what a awesome place to dine! Me and my girlfriend came here on a date a few weeks ago and we both have been to many fine dinning seafood and haven't had a better experience then this! Food was ON POINT!!! And the service was amazing! My girlfriend had some questions (usually way more then anyone can hangle) and a guy named Andrew.H could tell you anything you ever wanted to know about the food!!! 5 stars you guys ROCK!!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here while at a conference. It didn't appear to be one of the more popular restaurants as it was relatively emply on a Wednesday afternoon. Opted for a shrimp and scallop cerviche which was wel priced and delicious!"}
{"text":"I had just arrived to spend three nights at the Palazoo and decided to try this place because it was restaurant week. The complimentary bread was very hard, day old bread? Probably the worst bread I have ever had a restaurant. Wait..the food got a lot better after that. 

I tried the peach, tomoate and mozzarella salad. The cheese was the softest mozzarella I have ever had, very creamy consistency. The gave just enough for the salad. The salad was different beacuse of the peaches. I think I would have liked it more if it had been more traditional without the peaches though.

My date had the lobster bisque. There was hardly any lobster bits in it, but the soup had a nice flavor.

For the main course, I had the rib cap steak. It was a smaller cut, 8oz. It was served with crispy thin onion rings, mashed potatoes and a sauce. I really liked eating the steak with the onion. The steak was really prepared and very tender. I had asked for medium rare and my date had asked his steak to be medium. They brought out bought at medium. The did quickly replace mine though. I figured they must have had another medium rare one that had just been completed?

For dessert we had the Belgian Chocolate Smores. The dessert is very rich, I could only eat half of it. The marshmellows were made of a paste instead of an actually marshmellow, which I think would have worked better. The paste was pretty firm. 

The service was nice, there s a waiter and a food runner/water replinsher that helped alot. We say him way more than our waiter. The chef and manager both stopped by briefly to ask how things were.

Overall, we had a good experience. I don't think I will be back as there are many other restaurants in Vegas that I would like to try. If you want steak you must go to Gordon Ramsey's STEAK in the Paris hotel!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and our server was great.  I gave  this place 4 stars due to the fact that we had to wait longer than normal for our crab leg appetizer to arrive at our table.  Our. Server even apologized for the wait.  
Hot crab legs were amazing!  The surf and turf was huge and the barramundi fish that I had was fabulous! Very pricy, but if you want a guaranteed delicious meal for a special occasion, eat here!"}
{"text":"Dined here with a large group during Labor day weekend.  We made the reservations Saturday afternoon and they were able to accomodate us, for that night, so I was hesitant about this place.  Labor day weekend, Saturday night, and not booked? what gives? 

Well I was pleasantly surprised.  The place is unassuming from outside (located in the Venetian) but inside is tastefully decorated.  I loved all the soothing blue colors they used throughout. 

We were seated promptly and our server was stellar.  You could tell he was experienced and swiftly took our drink orders.  I heard him make some suggestions for wine as well as signature dishes to try.  

I decided to splurge on myself and ordered the crab stuffed lobster.  Now I've had lobster at chain restaurants, as well as fine dining establishments, but the lobster they brought out was the biggest I'd ever seen.  It was sliced in half exposing all of the wonderful meat, crab stuffing and served with drawn butter.  It was pure indulgence.  

The lobster was tender and sweet and the crab stuffing was savory and flavored well.  And then, dunking it all into the melted butter! It  was  too much for my taste buds! Needless to say, I was glad I decided to splurge because it was a well spent $70.  Oh yeah, there were vegetables served on the side, but clearly the lobster was the star.  

I did hear a few comments about the roasted chicken being too salty but overall, I think everyone else enjoyed their meals.  Honestly, I was too busy enjoying my lobster to even care."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.  We split the romaine salad and the aquaknox plateau and each got our own dessert and it was the perfect amount of food.  The salad had great flavors.  The real star of the dinner was the plateau.  It was full of delicious fresh oysters, shrimp, crab legs, lobster, mussels, and ceviche.  The atmosphere was nice and the service was good.  We would definitely return."}
{"text":"This would have to be one of the Nicest, and more expensive, places to eat around Las Vegas... Well worth it though when you're up from gambling, Great service and Relaxing Enviornment, plus Delicious and Filling dishes... My $46 NY Strip & Potatoes was the best, and was even too big to finish... Great Seafood too, so says the other people in my party..."}
{"text":"Easily the best meal I've eaten in years. We were lucky enough to visit during restaurant week, and even luckier that aquaknox was participating. We had the lobster bisque (divine) and crab cake (also very good), followed by the salmon and prawns for the main course. And then the lemon cheesecake and banana cream pie for desert.

Now let me tell you, I HATE salmon! I was stealing as many bites from the Hubs as possible. Soooo amazing...the prawns were delicious too. I wasn't fond of the cheesecake but the banana cream pie...GET IT NOW! 

Service was friendly and warm, impeccable throughout the meal, even as we were some of the last diners. Overall amazing experience. I'll go back every trip to Vegas. 

Also I'm from San Diego where we have lots of great food, not some Podunk place where Applebee's is fine dining."}
{"text":"I hosted a 50 person dinner party here. Valerie, the event planner, was incredibly helpful. She walked me through the menu items, a custom menu, the wine and the whole process. This was a very important work event for me. Aquaknox nailed it! The food was great! The service was great! We went over our reservation count by 12 people and the service team was incredibly accommodating. They didn't miss a beat.

Michael, the sommelier, picked out two incredible wines for the party. In particular, the New Zealand white wine was incredible.

Andrew and Andrew helped manage the party in such a professional way. They were just awesome.

The food was ridiculously great! 

Oh and by the way, they pulled this 50+ person party off with about two hours notice.

They have my highest recommendation!

Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the service in particular.  I was there with a group of about 12.  We arrived when there was no one in the restaurant, and our meal took almost 4 hours.  The service left a lot to be desired, and the food was just OK.  I expected much more for the price.  I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Not as good as we were expecting.   The fish was undercooked and swimming (get it) in sauce.  My shrimp had little shrimp legs.   On the plus side, the restaurant was comfortable and we got seated right away."}
{"text":"This is the first fine dining restaurant I ever went too and I go back as much as possible. I love the atmosphere and I always am impressed at the service. The food and drinks are always phenomenal."}
{"text":"I ate at Aquaknox last Saturdy for the first time.  I really liked the food.   We had the  Restaurant Week menu, and they didn't skimp even with the reduced price point.  My only complaint involves a policy they appear to subscribe to.  We arrived 20 minutes early for a 6 pm reservation.  The restaurant was nearly empty, and they refused to seat us until exactly 6.  They suggested we wait in the lounge, and of course order cocktails.  We would have ordered cocktails anyway, even if they had seated us right away, but I don't like to be manipulated."}
{"text":"Aquaknox stuffed crab lobster was awesome! The service was excellent! My servers Hilary&Miller were outstanding!"}
{"text":"I consider myself quite a connoisseur of fine dining and I'm not easy to please when it comes to my food, but this restaurant completely blew my mind and taste buds!!! Everything was perfect!!! From appetizers to desert they delivered big time!!! Tuna tartar was more than excellent, our halibut and barramundi were cooked to utter perfection and paired with equally delicious sides. The desserts.... Let me say I came back the next day for more. If you are going to spend some money on dining, do it here, you will not regret it. A bit of downside - interior design is a bit understated but with all that great food you will not notice it."}
{"text":"I stopped into Aquaknox to have a drink and a bite to eat and ended up getting a little toasty drinking \"Moscow Mules\" which is a quite simple yet utterly delicious beverage prepared with Russian Standard Vodka, ginger beer, and fresh lime. 

After a few of those I indulged in the clams with garlic bread which was out of this world.   

Service at the bar was superb and i was extremely happy with the whole deal.  Definitely going to come back for the full shibang one day."}
{"text":"I don't normally write Yelp reviews, but seeing as I've been eating at Aquaknox for almost 10 years now, I am compelled! My family and I are frequent diners along the Las Vegas strip and we've had our share of fine dining (Joel Robuchon, Picasso, Le Cirque, N9NE steakhouse, Eiffel Tower, etc.) and not once has Aquaknox disappointed us! I also lived in San Francisco/Bay Area for 5 years and nothing has compared to the quality of food or service that this restaurant provides!

Aquaknox's level of service is unparalleled. With the advent of their new manager, Min, we are always being taken care of and leave satisfied beyond our heart's content. One evening, my mother had requested for a pina colada, but it was not on their menu as they did not have a blender. My mom had no problem requesting for another drink, yet Min personally ran to neighboring restaurants to find a blender. For years, this has been our go-to seafood place (not to mention our favorite restaurant) when we're looking for a fancier-than-normal-kind-of-night.

I HIGHLY recommend the following dishes:
- Steamed mussels (request for extra bread!)
- Lobster cocktail w/ citrus garlic aioli
- Sweet shrimp and lump crab salad
- Lobster bisque (you can smell its heavenly essence from across the table)
- Filet mignon / Surf n Turf
- Pacific prawns on couscous with lobster cream
- Red Snapper on truffle potato puree

If you're looking for good seafood and a good time, go to Aquaknox. You can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place with impeccable service. Prices were consistent with fine dining anywhere I've been, and actually not bad for Las Vegas. The fish was perfectly cooked. Wine selections and specials were superb. Surprisingly, the place was empty during a Saturday night meal--we were there 8-10pm. Best kept secret?"}
{"text":"This review is a week overdue.  OMG!  One of the best meals I have ever had in Las Vegas.  
The ambiance, service and food were all top notch.  Our servers were Carlos and Brian.  They were so attentive and welcoming. We started with the very fresh and delicious Seafood Plateau. 2 of us ordered the Pan-Seared Barramundi, which is an Asian Sea Bass- white fish.  All the flavors were amazing and we both loved every bite!  For dessert we opted for Sticky Toffee Pudding which was just perfect after a great meal.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  I ordered the smoked fish as an appetizer.  The trout was tough and chewy, the cod was bland and tasteless, and I've had better smoked salmon out of the package from Costco.  Our waiter encouraged me to order the New Zealand Blue Nose Bass because they \"had just gotten it in,\" but it was overcooked and had no flavor whatsoever.  The pureed potatoes that accompanied it were equally unexciting.  My boyfriend had the surf and turf, and while the lobster was good, he said he's had better elsewhere and everything else was forgettable.  The service was fine.  The best part was an amuse bouche made of salmon and cream (and dill?), served with breadsticks.  I was looking forward to eating here based on the reviews, and I really, really wanted to like it,  but it was easily one of the most disappointing meals I've ever had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was spectacular. From the food to the service- everything was stellar. Best experience at any restaurant in Vegas. We had Chris and his assistant(did not catch his name. Tall guy with glasses and SUPER friendly). The service was excellent. They checked on us often and we did not wait long for our food to come out. 

For appetizers we had the lobster bisque and the crab cakes. My boyfriend loved his bisque. The crab cakes are a MUST! It is served over a corn relish that compliments the crab cakes very well! For our entrees I had the scallops and he had the Baramundi. He absolutely loved the Baramundi. My scallops were pretty good also. Everything tasted super fresh. Definitely give this place a try if you are craving seafood while in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"From the moment we were greeted until we payed the check, it was an outstanding experience.  The servers were knowledgeable, articulate, and very well synced with the kitchen. All the food was wonderful.  Highly recommend the seafood plateau as an appetizer.  We decided against dessert as we were quite full, so the manager stopped by with complimentary glasses of sparkling wine.  All the finishing touches made it well worth the price.  We will be going back!"}
{"text":"We splurged on a nice meal last night and found ourselves being seated in a nice, cozy booth at Aquaknox in the Venetian. The atmosphere was very romantic and it was great being seated in a \"secluded\" booth. If you are dining with 2 and want a romantic table please ask for a booth. (see photo's on my profile)
The service was over the top! At least 5 different people assisted us. They made the whole dining experience fantastic. 
For starters we had the shrimp cocktail - Yummy large shrimp but hold on for the hottest, tastiest cocktail sauce around. The Seafood Trio - Nice flavors. Plus my wife had the lobster bisque - She loved it. 
The service was quick and attentive. 
For the main meal, I had the crab and shrimp linguine in a spicy red sauce. It was very good and loaded with crab and shrimp. My wife had the halibut special over lobster succotash. She loved it and I had a bite. It was the best halibut ever! 
For dessert we had the apple pie and creme brulee, both were good. We had 3 different glasses of wine with dinner. 
My only objection to this place is the over priced wine list (by the bottle) and the high prices of the entree's."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this restaurant.  It was a true dining experience.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  I was even in love with the salad!  The sevice was great, the atmosphere was nice, we had an all around enjoyable evening.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good service. The bill was miscalculated but everything else was fine."}
{"text":"My standards for Las Vegas dining are very high.   Almost every chef who is a 'somebody' has a place on the strip, so when we came to try Chef Molony's restaurant after a long day, my hopes were high.  Thankfully, he did not disappoint.  

Ambiance + Service: love the feel of this restaurant and once you are a few steps in, you forget you are in Las Vegas (a big plus in my book).  Lovely textures, comfortable lighting and friendly, informative service set this evening off on the right food.

Wine List: Solid wine list, we opted to have a bottle recommended by our server.  Well chosen and moderately priced.

Apps: The Halloumi and Watermelon is awesome (worth sharing for sure) and the Butter Lettuce & Herb salad was stellar.  We were wistfully licking the plates as they left the table.

Mains:  All of the seafood selections were great, with the Wild Barramundi winning 'best dish' of the night.  The signature John Dory was also lovely and the prawns were delightful - and the heartiest dish.  That said, if you are only getting one dish: get the Barramundi.

We passed on dessert this time, but will definitely be coming back for more deliciousness next time I find myself in LV."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance and excellent service. Food was cooked to perfection and will definately be visiting again soon. Highly recommend the surf and turf ( lobster with crab and a fillet steak) amazing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite seafood restaurants in Las Vegas! Amazing service, delicious food, quality at its best!
Steamed clams, figs with goat cheese and the shrimp with couscous. Final touch of the evening is topped off with the souffl√©. 
We can never get enough of this place!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  
We had the lobster bisque.  Great.
I had the Pawns which were wonderful.
Husband had the scallops and he was just okay with them.
Dessert was Butterscotch Bread Pudding which was excellent.
Husband had very good Cr√®me Brulee."}
{"text":"One of the best meals of my life. Service, food, atmosphere: all perfect."}
{"text":"Delicious. Ordered the Aquaknox fish soup and it was incredible -- the best cioppino that I'd ever had. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Just an average seafood place with averagely high Las Vegas prices. I came here with a group of girlfriends on a Friday night and the place was dead. That's not usually a great sign but the restaurant itself is pretty and we all like seafood. I personally ordered two appetizers as an entree, the foie gras and the mussels. Most of my friends ordered the scallops and a few had other fishes.

The foie gras was quite strange. It was very tough and gamey. They should just take that one off the menu. The mussels were pretty good. A good size and the thai sauce and rice were done well.

My friends had no complaints about the scallops or fish but said it was nothing spectaulor for the price. They more had complaints about feeling rushed. Our server and the busboys were a little too pushy with trying to remove plates and bring the check. This is a nice restaurant that is practically empty, why rush us out?"}
{"text":"Me and my wife had a lovely dinner here.. Jessie was our server who took real good care. Suggested some good food and all the servers and staff were servicing with a smile .. I would go here again though people think it's pricy but to me it's priced right and value for a fresh food. Peruvian Sea bass was the best."}
{"text":"Great food: very fresh seafood, tender steaks... Everything we've ordered so far is perfectly cooked and delicious! I don't understand how they can even make chicken so tasty. 
Outstanding service. 
Upscaled casual but comfortable atmosphere.
What else can I ask?"}
{"text":"Fully redeemed !! What a turn around of service and the quality of food was exceptional. Thank you to Min for the amazing dining experience and compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"Strange - thought i already wrote a review on this place - but dang , i can't find it !

One of my freeloading meals - one of the few joys of the grind.

I can now say i've eaten at every restaurant at the Venetian ( though i still haven't done reviews on a few of them  - for example, Valentino - no pics, no review ! ) 

The overall impression of AquaKnox - nice.  It ain't stunning/earth-shattering, but it's solid and if i was in the seafood mood and on the northern side of the Strip  and not looking/affording over the top ( as in Bartolotta ) - this is the place to hit.

I tried the Lobster Bisque ( pic added ) 

And the whole , fresh fish of the day ( pic added ) - to be honest - i can't remember the name but i was told it had a similar taste/texture to sea bass ... and it did .  Kinda surprised that they didn't de-bone it at the table (  i think the prices justified such a service ) but it was fairly easy to separate the meat from the bones .

Surprsingly, I didn't  have dessert - a usual pleasure  again, when it's on another person's expense account - so i have no opinion on the desserts.

Again, overall, a decent place."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We had halibut that was to die for. Our server Jesse was wonderful as well. Everything was great! Very impressed and would recommend visiting here for your next seafood experience."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great food, must try the seafood platter on ice, seriously good. Had the grilled Bronzino, yum. The wait staff was excellent. Great place, good food."}
{"text":"I can't complain about the food.  Everything was great! They have the best Lobster bisque I have ever tried. I like the dressing of the crab claws.  The stuffing of the surf and turf was amazing!  I could ask for more with the food quality.  However, customer service was disappointing and unorganized... it took us 15 min. To get a menu and we would always have to tell the waiter twice to get what we need."}
{"text":"I came to visit a friend and to see Earth, Wind, and Fire...Aqua Knox was the third restaurant that we tried to get a table at.  We were very lucky that we were able to be seated right away. 
Tanya was great and our Filet mignon was better.  The entire meal was perfection, thank you for a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Went here with the wife and had a great time.   She had the crab stuffed lobster and I had the John Dory, which is similar to flounder.   The crab stuffed lobster was delicious and still had the lobster meat present and the crab stuffing was a great compliment to the richness is the lobster meat.   The John Dory came with lobster succotash and black truffles, which added elegance to the simple, yet delicious fish."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes!! Go here and go all out! 

I was taken here by a client about 5 years ago and had the BEST lobster ever. I went back tonight for the first time since and again had ... the BEST lobster ever.

Their seafood is impeccably fresh and the staff delightful. Yes, it's pricey, but I've concluded that there are two types of food in Vegas: CRAP (cheap) and REALLY good (expensive). Splurge and go for it!

I had the herb butter lettuce salad, 1/2 dozen oysters (3 diff varieties), 1/2 lobster (1 lb for $37 - they will say it's 2 lbs for $72 but ask for 1/2!), side of mashed pots, side of grilled asparagus, sorbet platter (3 big scoops of different kinds), espresso, and a 1/2 bottle of sauvignon ... everything was absolutely delightful and the crew (4 people??? Server, bus person, \"extension of the kitchen??\", and sommelier)  handling my table of one were top of the line service professionals.

GO HERE.

Have fun!"}
{"text":"This place was perfect!!!

First time visiting Vegas and wasn't too sure where to eat. I was staying at The Venetian, the choice of restaurants was great however the majority seemed to be steakhouses.. I wanted to try something a little different. 

As I was walking through the Venetian mall I came across AquaKnox. It looked unusual and colourful.. the main theme based on water! 

I ordered the Pan-Seared Barramundi Filet. It was cooked to perfection. It literally melted in my mouth and the accompanying mash and vegetables were delicious! 

I was strongly recommend this restaurant for all seafood lovers! 

The service was great! The waiters recommended certain dishes and gave tasters of other parts of the menu! 

The dessert was incredible! The white chocolate bread pudding was unbelievably tasty! 

It's definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"My experience here was wonderful - from start to finish! We had the tuna tartar appetizer and the surf n turf with the crab stuffed lobster and the filet. Everything was absolutely incredible! And let's not forget the amazing banana cream pie (a dessert I would never normally consider), which was extremely delicious. 

The thing that made this place so above and beyond was the genuine, attentive and outstanding service from the second we walked in the door to the second we left. All of the hostesses, our servers Brad and Adrian, and the manager Melody all played an important role in making our visit to AquaKnox something to rave about! 

Next time I'm in Vegas, it'll be my first stop!"}
{"text":"They were \"open\" for lunch....that means cold sandwiches and offerings from the \"raw\" seafood bar. Three iced teas and the \"cocktail sampler\" came to about 40 dollars with tip.

Service was unbelievably slow.

The seafood cocktails were about 3 oz each of shrimp(around U30) with a bit of spice, lobster and crab.  I had a hard time differentiating the two, and there was more than acceptable amount of shell in them, and not that fresh tasting either.

Would not ever eat here again.

That said, one of the hostess/greeters was stunning.  Simply one of the most lovely women I have seen anywhere, and as I left, I told her that she was too good for this place......and she is.

One of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"With high prices come high expectations and unfortunately AquaKnox did not deliver on the expectations.  The ambience was nice and modern but also BIG - Not really where I'd go for an intimate setting - The place was half empty at 7:00 pm on a Saturday Night - Not a good sign.  The Food was good possibly even very good but also very expensive - About a third overpriced compared to other similar locations.  The wine list also was quite expensive with not much under $100 a bottle (there were some though).  When a glass of wine costs 50% more then what you can get for an entire bottle at the local Walgreens - about 5X retail - Thats pricey (In my opinion wine should never be more then 2-3 X retail)  Finally, Service was good but again not great.  I don't mind paying more but as the cost goes up so do my expectations and they simply was not met."}
{"text":"Lively bar with blue cheese stuffed olives. I had been here before and had the raw oysters. This time was about 7:30pm on a weekday for a cocktail before dinner. Location provided great people watching because some seats look out onto the main walkway. The place is cool, open, and airy. Service was great. This is in my permanent rotation."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 stars if possible.  

My girlfriend I came here for dinner on Monday, 6/1/15.  I had made a reservation and made note that it was our Anniversary.  The hostess even called earlier in the day to confirm the reservation and confirm that it was an anniversary and that she would make sure they did something special for us.  Nothing special every happened....so that was kinda disappointing.  

We arrived and were seated promptly in a circular booth thing which was nice.  I'll agree with some other reviews that say the decor and ambiance is a little cheesy.  It is.  It's kinda Ikea-meets-modern-asian-fusion-vibe.  Everything just looks kinda cheap.  

Anyway,  we were promptly greeted by the server (Miller) and he gave us some time to look over the menus.  When he came back he answered any questions we had.  He was very thorough and very helpful.  

Drinks:
She got some rosemary gin thing.  I got an Old Fashioned.  Both were pretty average cocktails.  Nothing Spectacular. But they were good.  

We then ordered some appetizers:
Octopus Carpacchio and Little Neck Clams.  Both were pretty darn good.  The butter sauce on the clams could be enjoyed on it's own haha.  So good.  

Ordered more drinks:
We decided to get wine this time.  As we were looking at the list, the Sommelier noticed and stopped by the provide some recommendations.  He was honest and not trying to sell the most expensive wine, he was going based upon our likes/dislikes.  We ordered a two different wines and they were great selections.  

Entrees:  
She got the Butterfish, I got a Filet.  Both were great.  The Butterfish was pretty amazing.  Texture and flavor were perfect.  

Dessert:  
Banana Cream Pie and Creme Br√ªl√©e.  They were both good desserts.  Interesting presentation on the Banana Cream Pie.  

My girl was curious about Absinthe, so the server gave her a little taste.  That was nice of him to do.  

We got the check, paid and left.  

I was kinda disappointed that there was \"nothing special\" for an anniversary.  Why would the hostess bother to say \"we will do something special for you\" if there was nothing special.  My girlfriend even asked \"did you tell them it was our anniversary?\" I said, \"yup, but i guess they didn't want to do anything.\"  

Like I said, the server Miller was great and the food was pretty good.  Was just a little disappointed that they didn't help us \"celebrate.\""}
{"text":"Just a regular seafood place.  Nothing special. I had the cold seafood platter. It was as expected.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"Seafood at its best! The combo plates we ordered (large group) caused much laughter and discussion about how to eat each item, and what was what! Service was top notch, and they rushed our order to meet our show time."}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable place to eat. I prefer sweet tasting cocktails that aren't too strong and at AquaKnox they're made just to my liking. 
Shrimp cocktails are delicious although I prefer only lemon on mine. Their cocktail sauce is super spicy from the horseradish and it's too overpowering for me. However, my husband loves it so it depends on your liking. 
Filet mignon is always amazing and cooked to perfection. I like my filet medium rare. Bread pudding for dessert was wonderful as well. 
Overall, dinner was pleasant. Staff is friendly and very knowledgeable. Thank you for another great dinner!"}
{"text":"I am all about sauce.  Cooking the fish to perfection is expected, and it was perfect.  But the sauce on the halibut with the lemongrass broth was perfection.  Every bite has to be thoroughly savored as meals of this quality are few.  My date had the mesquite grilled New Zealand King salmon and was fantastic, but the halibut was world class.  

A large wine list with a wide range of prices was great, including my favorite sparkling wine, since I will no longer drink French sparkling wine (a won't call theirs by the 'C' word either), J (Jordan) sparkling wine.  I do miss Vueve Cliquot, but since they want to be jerks, J is the best California alternative.  

Vegas has the best dining and there are a lot of choices, and same have more notoriety, so if you have enjoyed the big names, the food here is a hidden gem to be tried.  I found the service rushed, but knowledgeable, accommodating, and friendly.  The staff and atmosphere are fine, but the food is so much the star I could have been seated at a picnic table and still have given this 5 stars."}
{"text":"Seafood platter was delicious with large variety of shell fish sized appropriately. Our sirloin steak was a bit gamey we got it medium rare. The octopus was a bit chewy. Service was mediocre at best. The bar did not carry Japanese whiskey. That might be more of a personal choice so will not let it affect the overall score. They did have great shellfish and a very large selection of wine. Kind of a cool wine cellar. If your looking for seafood and wine it's a great choice."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review.  Aquaknox sits in the Venetian, in restaurant row.  The bar has a nice seating area, and is chill, without pretending to be a ultralounge.  The restaurant itself has nice ambiance... despite being on a main walking drag, you can be just inside the restaurant and it's not too loud, which is kind of a miracle.  The food was solid.  Again, I'd put the food at 3.5 stars. I had the blue cheese caesar, which was properly dressed, and had lots of flavor.  The tuna crudo and tartare were both very tasty, and used interesting flavors with the fish. It didn't make the fish the star, but it was tasty, and that's coming from a purist."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for a drink and the raw bar.  The drinks were good and so were the oysters.  The service was pretty good, not the best.   I would like to come back and actually try their dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's day. The service was excellent. They were very attentive and friendly. Food was amazing as well. They gave us a complementary Amuse Bouche and a cute dessert. It was perfect."}
{"text":"Was able to just walk in Friday night and sit down even though it was pretty crowded.  My table had the Bone in steak, lobster bisque and scallops.  The Steak was delicious, it was cooked perfectly and the sauce and potatoes with it made it taste all the better.  My favorite was the corn and polenta that was served with the scallops.  The service was friendly and very attentive. All in all dinner was a highlight of the night and I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"After a lukewarm first experience a while back, I was reluctant to try this place again. Due to a variety of factors, including a hankering for fresh oysters, Hubby and I  decided to give this place another whirl. Boy was I glad we did.

We were seated in a lovely booth with high ceiling and cascading curtains. It was a bit drafty, so we moved to the booth next door. The booths were romantic and private, compared to the other tables.  

Our servers, Mark and Zack, were attentive and approachable, not pretentious at all. Just a couple of nice guys who actually care about our dining experience. We didn't like the breadsticks but the dip they brought with it was delightful. We ordered a dozen fresh oysters, consisting of 3 varieties (Shigoku, Miyagi, and Gold Creek) and 3 sauces. They were super fresh and went down so easy with Prosecco, we ordered another dozen of the Shigoku Oysters, which were even tastier and slightly larger than Kumamoto Oysters. After two dozen superb oysters, we felt we had reached Oyster Nirvana. 

We ordered a Romaine Heart of Lettuce to share. It was a generous helping even with the split. The lettuce was crisp and the Caesar dressing was spot on.  Then Zack surprised us with two small crab cakes which was compliments of the Chef. They blew our minds away! We would definitely order those again and again.

We ordered both the Steamed Mussels and Steamed Little Neck Clams to share. The Mussels were definitely the tastier of the two, even better than the mussels at Bouchon. You could taste the freshness in each bite. My Hubby loved the mussel broth so much he practically made a meal out of dipping the crispy buttered bread into the Chardonnay Herbed Butter broth. 

By the time the Grilled Whole Branzino came, we were quite full already. It was a bit under-salted, but nothing a bit of sea salt could not fix.  Again, they split it into two nice plates for us and we devoured every last morsel. 

We were too stuffed to order dessert but my Husband did enjoy the complimentary Chocolate Truffles at the end. This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed all the way around.  My husband had scallops, and they were fairly bland.  I had tuna tartare which I asked if it was spicy. Server said no and then I couldn't even eat it-it was very spicy.  Server seemed more interested in football game.  We were there about 8pm on a Sunday and restaurant was fairly dead.  Not what we were expecting for a nice seafood restaurant in the Palazzo and wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I came here a few months ago for restaurant week. I dropped $110 for a prix fixe menu with wine pairing. 

The sommelier matched great wines with indelible food. The absinthe root beer float sticks out in my mind. That was amazing. I had a piece of everyone's food and it was great.

I must say that the wait staff was on top of their game."}
{"text":"Came here for our four year anniversary, was super cute and us being locals haven't dined here before. They set us up in a nice booth and our server was awesome. Started with some wine and the trio, delicious. Boyfriend had the scallops, so delicious and I had the special which was a halibut I believe for $53. Little pricey, halibut was a little dry, but the lobster corn succotash that it was paired with was phenomenal. Service and dining was great. Only problem is they brought out an anniversary dessert plate but charged us for it. But other than that definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I've Never had such Delicious so Fresh Seafood. Worth every cent, very satisfied :) The Chef even gave us a wonderful military discount. The service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for two birthdays, service was a bit slow =(, the food was pretty good but service definitely could have been a bit better. We also got nothing for both our birthdays (it really was both our birthdays, no lie) which I was a bit disappointed with.

We got the crabcake which was definitely amazing as an appetizer and then got Wild Alaskan Halibut, Aquaknox Fish Soup both which were pretty good I will say. The atmosphere was a bit more casual than i expected (I was in a suit and felt a bit overdressed) but overall not a bad dining experience."}
{"text":"I knew I was saving my very first review for a special restaurant. AquaKnox was the perfect dining experience to celebrate reconnecting with an old friend. 

The food is phenomenal but what made my experience memorable was the service. Our sommelier Scott was very knowledgable and paired each course perfectly. 

I look forward to dining here again when I go back to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We definitely wanted seafood while we were in Vegas. The Venetian's Aqua Knox had some pretty good reviews. However, I had some pangs of hesitation when I saw pictures of the restaurant online. It looked sort of cold to me and I wondered how our meal would be, given that environment. But we made our reservations and were so, SO surprised at how nice the restaurant was once we got there. I don't think the pictures do it any justice. It was lovely and we were so happy we decided to try it anyway!

The service was most excellent! Friendly, informative, attentive and timely. We could not have asked for better. And, the food! We loved it! Interesting choices, wonderful flavour, creative presentations... so, SO good! We would go back there in a heartbeat. We loved it!"}
{"text":"This was one of our best dining experiences. I totally forgot to review it, but we think of it often. We had the mussels that came with an amazing sauce and sticky rice. We both had the lobster, and it was so delicious. Quite an expensive place to eat for dinner, but the quality is excellent with great proportions. The service was some of the best we've had. 

We'll definitely make a stop here again when we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"All I can say is yum.  The surf and turf was the special which was offered.  The dish included filet mignon which was tender and the lobster which was also pretty good.  Not much else to the dish, but it didn't need much.  We also had an order of the seafood appetizer dish:

ceviche was great
oysters were good
clams were tough
crab claws were okay
shrimp was good"}
{"text":"With so many fine dining options in Vegas, I was really hoping that I had made a smart choice with AquaKnox.... Due to the less than acceptable service and mediocre food (taste and portion sizes) I left feeling disappointed. Perhaps visiting Gordon Ramsay Steak a couple nights prior set the bar too high...

The highlight was getting our picture taken in the private one table wine cellar... I wouldn't choose this restaurant for a special event, like an anniversary or birthday because you likely will not get the attention you deserve."}
{"text":"We came here for a NYE Dinner. Service was horrendous. Horrible experience from ordering and to paying for the check. We had a heavy lunch so some of us were ordering lighter and only got soup, Miller the waiter had the audacity to say \"Is that all\" in a super rude tone. After waiting over an hour and fifteen minutes we finally asked the waiter what's the status. We weren't planning on spending NYE Midnight in this restaurant. The waiter kept saying two minutes, two minutes, until another 20 minutes passed. Food finally arrived, steaks were warm but plates were hot meaning they sat under the warming light. The food was NOT worth the price or the wait. Then to top it off, the waiter throws the check on the table and walks away. We will not be returning here and would not recommend it to anyone. There are far better places to spend your money at on the strip."}
{"text":"The bartenders were excellent, then we moved to our table where the waiter was excellent, Scott the sommelier was useless (aren't they supposed to like talking about wine?) The lobster bisque was stellar, as others have noted.  Hubs crab cake was good.  

Then the kitchen stopped cold.  Nothing came out for ages.  Waiter assured us 'soon' but it wasn't.  When we got our entrees they were good, but tarnished by the excessive wait.  I had the barramundi which had delish crispy skin but piled with pickled veg that really didn't complement the fish.

When we declined dessert, we gotta weird combo of a petit four and a mojitos hot that did not go together at all and was dropped quickly in front of us by a runner who seemed to be having a shitty night.

The restraint wasn't crowded and I can see why.  I'd hit the bar for its excellent bartenders, but skip the dining room."}
{"text":"Best in Sea & Land

My husband and I had the Honor of dining at Aquaknox for our 25th Wedding Anniversary Dinner!  Holy Cow!  What an experience!  We had a \"Tour of the Menu\" with wine paring!  I literaly floated out after dinner!  We started off with the Aquaknox Plateau for 2!  The presentation is Beautiful!  I would love to tell my favorite,  but the ENTIRE plateau was incredible, Lobster, Oysters, Prawns, Crab, Mussels, and Ponzu Oyster Shooters I was in SEAFOOD HEAVEN!  The Lobster Bisque was Perfectly Creamy, very comforting, get that warm fuzzy feeling when it slides down!  The Crab Cakes were Outstanding!  Our Filet's were cooked to perfection, just the way I love to eat it! I mean you can't ask for more!  They give it ALL UP!  The service was Stellar!  From our Server to our Somm. everything was Remarkable!  I happen to love the seating there as well, they offer the coziest booths if you are looking for a little bit more privacy while you indulge!  Very elegantly decorated and they have a most beautiful water wall on the way in!  The Venetian has done it once again, another NOT TO MISS spot in Las Vegas, Aquaknox!"}
{"text":"Okay, I want to love this place. It's in the Venetian hotel, close to all the typical conference activities, but how can you be a high-end seafood restaurant and have fake seafood in your raw bar window. This sets the wrong tone for the entire meal. When the raw bar is fake up front (see pics) how can your trust what's going on out back?  I can't..."}
{"text":"Elegant and exquisite restaurant. My friends and I stopped in last night for a bite to eat. Most places are about an 1 hour wait. We got into aquaknox less than 20 mins. The food was absolutely amazing! Try the poke as an appetizer and get the king salmon for your main course. Our server delivered outstanding service and did his job. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Just finished our anniversary dinner. Our main server was Miller- he was excellent at being condescending, and that's about it. My wife and I were treated like we were 16 at a prom dinner. Started with the irritation after we ordered oysters, he offered zero information about them so I asked our sever  where are they from - his reply was \"I am not sure... \" and then told us where he thought they might be from but was annoyed at the question. Next up drinks, my wife ordered a white wine by the glass and they have two symbols, one a half full glass another a full glass. He informed me the full one obviously meant 9 oz. I asked for the beer list and he told me about the 3 choices on draft and then said and we have a ton of bottled beers and asked what I like, and I said pilsner or on the lighter side, after an awkward pause he offered no further explanation or  choices do I asked about the bottles and said well those are Millers, bud, etc. it's hard to imagine a 4 dollar sign vegas restaurant only has bud and Miller. He then told us we need to order now because the food is made to order- we did upon his advise and we had our food within 10 min of ordering- the whole experience was 50 min total- for once we were not trying to eat fast and wanted to sit and enjoy a long meal. The last straw was when trying to order a salad, I ordered barramundi entree and he said how about a salad with that so I said sure what are my options- he plopped the menu on my plate and pointed to the salad category. In general the attitude was unappreciated from a higher end restaurant. The replacement server was excellent and we had no further dealings with Miller for the rest of the night. Food was fairly tasty but there are countless other alternatives. We have tried the next door restaurant delmonicos and Le cirque and liked both much better.

Update: the general manager of the restaurant reached out to apologize and ask for a second chance- I am impressed to the attention to postings and while I was not intending to gain anything I appreciate the offer to have my wife and return. At least they care enough to reach out."}
{"text":"I think we ended up trying pretty much everything because I and my loved ones are are all impulsive and gluttonous.  I was really pleased by everything.   I... can't say what is best, I took notes and after every item I ordered or stole from my dining mates I just wrote \"YES!!\".  

Service was good; not treat-you-like-royalty good, but no complaints at all."}
{"text":"We came here for my husband's birthday dinner, I made reservations a couple weeks in advance, but we didn't really need to. The plus was that they knew ahead of time that it was my husband's birthday and a late anniversary trip. So they greeted us with that in mind. It was just the two of us and we're both big seafood people. To start, he had the Steam Greenlip Mussels and I had the Lobster Bisque Soup...they were so delicious. 

We enjoyed every bite of our starters and the portions were perfect. The lobster bisque was nice and rich and creamy without being heavy. It was good enough to want to come back - and that's considering there are restaurants at every corner on the strip, and even within the Venetian. 

The Mussels were yummy. We're fans of curry so the aroma and spice were superb. To give it to you straight, they were bomb. Both appetizers were bomb. 

Our entrees consisted of the Ora King Salmon and the New Bedford Scallops. I had the scallops, so my review will be much more detailed than the salmon. The scallops come with squid ink pasta that is perfectly cooked. Initially, I wanted to devour the pasta, but slicing a piece of scallop paired perfectly. There were many different pieces to my dish and the flavors worked for me, I loved it. I couldn't finish the plate though, and ended up taking a scallop and some of the other pieces of the dish and took it back up to our hotel. My husband did not finish his either - but he did say it was delicious. I had a bite, and from what I could tell, it tasted great.

Since it was my husband's birthday they came out with a surprise complementary dessert for us. They were two macarons with a pink yougurty drink. It reminded me of the little bottles of Korean yogurt drinks. 

Yummy food. We love the Venetian and Palazzo in general so I'm sure we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This was our third trip here, first was around 10 years ago. Very rushed meal took less than an hour, even though the place was only 50% full. Waiter wanted us to order wine before we decided on the food. After we ordered a glass, 2 different waiters asked us if we wanted wine.

Tuna poke app, very good taste but crackers did not work well. 8/10

Tasting trio app, great crab and lobster was so-so. Shrimp ceviche did not belong in the mix, they used to offer scallops. 6/10

Scallops main dish, very good but not perfect as in the past. 9/10

Baramundi main dish, fish was perfect with a great crust, but it was sitting on some pathetic mashed potatoes and topped with a salad. 7/10

Desserts, I had bread pudding and wife had something similar with ice cream. Very forgettable. 7/10

Wine. The waiter strongly pushed the house brands which were OK but overpriced. 5/10

Service. Very rushed, did not offer specials until I asked. Did not offer coffee or after dinner drinks to go with dessert. 7/10

This place used to be our grail for seafood, sad that they are now just another overpriced Casino restaurant."}
{"text":"I am from Seattle and my nose automatically goes skyward when I go to a land-locked seafood joint.  The waiter said ALL of their seafood is fresh, including the New Zealand King Salmon, which is what I ordered and it was one of the best peices of salmon I've ever had.  It tasted more like Steelhead.  The oysters, poke, and ceviche were all delicious.  They really knocked my nose down here!  Thank you :)"}
{"text":"One of the best fine dining experiences I've had, Aquaknox is heaven for a pescaterean such as myself, the scallops melted in your mouth, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and tender. Even the garnishes and cous cous was the best I'd ever had. The smoked salmon puree (given at the start of each meal) was amazing!  I found myself forking for leftover puree once the breadsticks were out. 
The atmosphere was ethereal, like an abstract and elegant \"under the sea\" experience. Incredibly romantic, its definitely a place to share with someone special. The booths are a must if you're with your significant other, very private with beautiful blue drapes. 
Although the atmosphere is elegant and implies the appropriate dress code, I'd love to come there with my comfiest, stretchiest sweatpants and try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Everything here was great. My scallops were cooked to perfection the pasta and veggies were a perfect accent. I don't eat oysters, but my date insisted that I share a dozen with him so I agreed and a few days later I find myself craving them. Needless to say, the oysters were very fresh and delicious. Service was quick and attentive. I have nothing bad to say about this place, except that we walked around in circles until we found it. No one at the Venetian or Palazzo gave very good directions, or maybe we were just too tipsy?"}
{"text":"One word sums up my experience here--WOW! I tried making a reservation at this restaurant on Open Table in advance of my arrival in Vegas, but none were available. Luckily, my friend and I walked in at the time we wanted anyway and had no problems being seated. Every staff member was on point. Our two servers were gracious without being overbearing, and the sommelier gave us some great tips on what wine to order. After we placed our order, we were surprised by a complimentary starter of seafood croquettes. Then, my friend and I split the Black Garlic Caesar, which was unlike any other Caesar I've ever had. The dressing was outstanding! I ordered the AquaKnox Fish Soup as my main entree, because I had read about how amazing it was in various reviews. It completely exceeded my expectations, and I frequent a local seafood restaurant back home that I used to think had the best bouillabaisse on the planet. Just when I thought our meal couldn't get any better, we were presented with a complimentary dessert--almond cookies topped with strawberries. They were absolutely delicious! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Fort the $$$, I've had WAAAAAY better.
Not worth your money."}
{"text":"Ok, here is the deal.  I've been to Aquaknox many times for drinks at the bar and its always ok.  One time the bartender didn't know how to make a Kir Royale and I had to explain it to her.  I let it slide since I thought it may not be the most popular drink even if I consider it to be standard.

On my last trip to Vegas my friend, the birthday girl, decided to have her birthday dinner at Aquaknox.  Finally given the chance to try the cuisine, I have to admit that I was not very impressed.  The Sommelier was moderately helpful in the end but during the process of selecting a wine she continuously suggested wines that were clearly out of the price range we were looking.  (I hate when Sommeliers do that.  I'm not going for the $180 bottle of wine tonight, thanks).  In the end she was able to produce two bottles of a nice chardonnay not on the menu.  

The butter lettuce and herb salad was good, the dressing was nice and light and the salad was a good size.  The shrimp cocktail, however, was not as good.  It was literally downed in cocktail sauce.  I'm the kind of girl that likes to dip (my husband on the other hand likes to smother) and I didn't appreciate the pint of cocktail sauce on my shrimp.  (To be fair it was a good sized serving of shrimp).

Aquaknox probably would not be on the top of my list of Vegas restaurant suggestions."}
{"text":"Service: top-notch! My entree came out 15 minutes after my family's because the chef was not happy with how he cooked my fish. I was told by the manager that he made another portion. Manager comped the entree for me; it was swordfish  ($38).

Ambience: Beautiful setting with upscale decor. 

Food: My kids said it was the best fish stew they've ever had. I tried it and indeed it was delicious! Very fresh seafood in a saffron broth. 
My fish dish was well-balanced in flavor and the fish was cooked perfectly. 

Price: I think it is very comparable to other 5-Star hotel restaurants in Vegas. Mains are $40-$50. Fish stew was $54 (well-worth it!). Starters are $10-$20. 

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Must try the tomahawk wagyu it just melts in your mouth and the chimichurri was also a good addition to the meat. All the seafood is super fresh and our server brian was on point with all the food suggestions! Also try the bread pudding you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent. Had Chris for our server and thoroughly enjoyed his recommendations. My wife and I couldn't agree on what our favorite dish was. I enjoyed the Marus King Crab and she loved the halibut with lobster mash potatoes. Everything was delicious. We even tried the Absinthe root beer float. Not a fan of the licorice taste but the presentation was awesome.
(Posted this 3/1/14, but actually dined there 2012. Stupid me, just realized that I never completed the post. My wife and I still talk about the food. 5 stars.)"}
{"text":"Came here on our last night of our weekend Vegas getaway.  Had no reservations on a Saturday night, but we got a table nonetheless.  The hostess proceeded to sit us at a table of 6 for our party of 5.  Seeing that there were 5 settings, but 6 chairs, the gorgeous hostess reamed the help to \"get their act together\".  Hot and bitchy, now that's my kind of girl.

The food was decent for the most part.  Had the Seafood Plateau to start which had fresh items from the raw bar.  My entree was the fish soup, which was sort of a spin on the classic cioppino.  My friends had the scallops which were delicious.  The bill was not cheap, but not outrageous.  This place is on par with most decent seafood joints in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner.  The seafood is excellent.  I ordered scallops and they were cooked to perfection, nice and buttery, melt in your mouth.  My friend ordered the whole fish and it looked amazing.  She said it tasted really good and well cooked.  
For appetizers we ordered a dozen oysters and they were amazing.  I love oysters.  It came with 3 different types of oysters so we all had 3 each.  
We didn't order any dessert but they gave me the flourless chocolate cake as it was my birthday.  It was pretty good but not amazing.  I prefer souffles myself.  The latte I ordered was tasty and it came with a biscotti on the side.  All in all we had a pretty good experience.  If you like seafood then this is the place to come as the seafood is very fresh and they know how to cook it."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from the oysters here. Got clammy and sweaty during a huge conference, passed out because I was so sick, had to go to emergency room type of food poisoning."}
{"text":"AquaKnox, located in The Venetian Resort Hotel & Casino, is, as I am told, one of the area's premier seafood restaurants. I am not one who enjoys fish, so I perused the menu for an alternative. On that, or any menu, a steak suits me just fine. 

It is fish that I can live without, but I do like shrimp, crab and lobster. Fitting with that, I and my business travel companion shared the Seafood Trio appetizer: sweet shrimp, lobster and jumbo crab served with AquaKnox cocktail sauce. The name is rather misleading as only the shrimp comes with the cocktail sauce. Each of the three meats comes plated with its own unique sauce. Of the three, though I liked them all, the crab was my least favorite. 

I ordered their Bone-In Ribeye, though the menu online shows \"Bisteca (32 oz. Prime Double Cut Porterhouse).\" I cannot say if that is new to the menu or if the ribeye is instead. What I can tell you is that the competition in my search for the best steak in Las Vegas just got a little tougher. The ribeye came over root vegetables. I feel bad saying that the ribeye at AquaKnox is one of the best steaks in 'Vegas if it is not even an option anymore. I cannot speak to the porterhouse, though I would be tempted to try a \"serves two\" steak alone! 

The prices were not outrageous, though I had expected them to be. Most main dishes were around $30. If you need to find it, the restaurant is located outside the Blue Man Group Theatre. 

AquaKnox has not converted me to the ways of seafood, but through steak they have helped me recommend this restaurant to you. There are so many restaurants in Las Vegas I do not know if I will ever go back to AquaKnox, but it was worth going once for me. And if the situation arose, I would not hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Went on September 3, 2013 for our 25th wedding anniversary.  I had the bone in ribeye and my wife had sea bass. I was suspect at first ordering steak at a seafood restaurant.  I was wrong.  The ribeye was almost the best I've ever tasted.  Maestros in Scottsdale,  AZ was the best, but this was second. The service was outstanding.  I'd highly recommend it!  Banana Cream pie was okay. Probably want to get a different dessert."}
{"text":"Unprofessional and snobby attitudes from the staff. No thanks.  We took our $500 tab next door to Delmonico's where the service was exemplary.  Fine dining restaurants are a dime a dozen in Vegas. This restaurant needs to hire people who understand how to treat patrons professionally.  

To upper management - if you are going to make a 9:45 reservation, don't close your kitchen at 10pm.  I'm sure your patrons would have liked a heads up when making the reservation.  I know I would have.  Also your hostess could use some training on handling patrons professionally."}
{"text":"Thank you Chef James DeFraga for your awesome menu for our company dinner. My steak was just fantastic.  Super tender and it was a huge portion too! Love the Ahi Tuna as well as the Arugula salad. Very light and tasty. The Coconut Panna Cotta dessert was the icing to end a wonderful evening.  Service was impeccably on point, and please thank all your staff for their excellent service."}
{"text":"Looooove this place! Came here for a special occasion and ordered far niente chardonnay and just went crazy with the dinner. Everything was amazing"}
{"text":"Great spot in vegas if you are looking for a delicious seafood meal with a decent selection and enjoyable ambience.  I had the blue prawns with golden couscous and  my friend had the barramundi. Both were excellent. The specialty cocktails were quite tasty and the chef sent out complimentary dessert bites. My only complaint would be the service; the back waiter was helpful but the main server was slow, somewhat rude and  not attentive in the slightest. It was almost 10pm and there were only about 10 tables with guests and at least 8 waiters on staff  I would go back under the assumption that we happened to get the worst waiter in the place. Food was excellent and there a few other dishes I would love to try,"}
{"text":"Perfection! Food was amazing, I got the Pacific White Prawns, delightful! My 
husband had the Baramundi which was amazing too! We had the sommelier select a bottle, he made a great selection that paired with both our dishes, good man! The service was top notch and not stuffy, the room is beautiful this is a gem in the Venetian, heck all of Las Vegas, it is sublime. We live in Vegas and often skip the strip, but Aquaknox is an experience we can't wait to repeat!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! My sister and I recently celebrated her birthday in Las Vegas and had the pleasure of dining at Aquaknox. For appetizers she had the lobster bisque, which she had previously and said was the best she's ever had. I had the wild blue crab cake with chayote slaw and remoulade sauce which was excellent and we shared a beet salad that was out of this world.For entrees she had the Pacific blue prawns(excellent), I had a Tandoori chicken dish that doesn't appear to be on the menu any longer(excellent) and though we both skipped desert they brought us each a small cookie with a glass of hot chocolate and rum which capped things off perfectly. The service was outstanding and quick and made for a very enjoyable birthday dinner. I'm already looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"the lounge area is very cool, spacious.  the food is solid, seafood tasted very fresh.  it's a lot less of a 'scene' here and more reasonably priced than the other celebrity chef restaurants in and around venentian"}
{"text":"Nice setting and we were seated in a great booth. Excellent fries as a s starter, along with nice cocktails, then downhill. My friend's sea bass was indifferent at best and my steak was literally too tough to cut. Both entrees were served on an instant potato style moosh. We split one banana cream pie which, although not a pie, sort of tasty. Service was sporadic at best."}
{"text":"Overall great experience at Aquaknox. Clean and fresh ambience, with cool touches such as the modern \"clamshell\" booths. 

A few of the cocktails on the menu were trying too hard to be unique. I started with some sort of spice-laden old fashioned which was brimming with fruit and other froo froo ingredients, but switched to a manhattan and was fine. (It was the first old fashioned my girlfriend has liked, so they were successful in making it a girly drink.) The Riesling I had with dinner was not the best either. 

But on to the food. 

We started with the raw oyster selection, which was excellent, very fresh. The Alaskan king crab leg appetizer, served chilled with a little bit of lemon and Tabasco was amazing, we should have ordered the larger portion. 

The John Dory was the highlight for me, and the scallops in a blood orange sauce were for my girlfriend. The scallops were a bit firm for me, but still very flavorful."}
{"text":"What clouded the experience was the idiot that was serving us.  

Not sure if it was his first week on the job, but he missed an ENTIRE course and was condescending when we asked for only ONE of the crab claws.  

Verbatim on WHY he missed the salad course:
\"The order (sheet)  was all funky, so I scratched it out and wrote a new one.\"

YES, you read right, he said, FUNKY in a white tablecloth restaurant.  

I guess he didn't learn to COPY things in elementary school.

He didn't apologize for his screw up.  ARGH!!!!  

And WE had to give him ideas on how to alleviate HIS mistake.  He screwed up, he should fix it, and COMP something.  He suggested that we skip the course, b/c even if we heated our main courses it would compromise the quality.  OKAY....but we still want our damn salads, it takes FIVE minutes to throw a salad together, and we already waited FIVE minutes for him to notice that we didn't touch our food.  

Our main courses were already lukewarm.  God.  RECOGINIZE foolio.  

Hence, to save his dumb ass, he was on top of things for the rest of the meal, to the point of annoying.  I hate that.  

FREEBIE: Breadsticks, super yum, they were dusted with black pepper and the dip was smoked salmon pate.  FAB.  

Things to order: 
Scallops, very good, they were HUMONGOUS!!!  The combined net weight was probably more than a 10 ounce steak.  Meaty, tender & flavorful.  

To skip:
-Trio was alright, not delicate, the sauces covered up the crab, tuna, and lobster flavors.  The lobster was rubbery.
-Red snapper, bland, and tough.  DRY.  

Was the wait for the salads worth it?  Not really.  It was the Caesar and the Bibb...

The last FREEBIE.  Mmmm...they were little triangles of brownie bites with chocolate rice crisps.  So save your $$$ and don't order dessert.

We were sat in the center of the restaurant against the railing, ask for a booth, overall the ambiance was better than most of the restaurants in the Venetian and the Palazzo."}
{"text":"Save room for dessert. As tempting as it is to blow it all on the food (salmon that was proud to die for you) and wine. Their dessert had just as much love put into it."}
{"text":"What an amazing feast!!! The steamer clam appetizer.... Best I have ever had, bar none.
The fish soup....off the hook!!! An amazing assembly of massive prawns.,clams, mussels, halibut and half of sweet, succulent lobster. The broth has just the right spice and an excellent sliced French bread with a garlic, basil and butter topping to die for.

Hands down the best overall seafood meal I have ever enjoyed. If I could give it 10 stars I would!!
The amazing food is equaled by the attentive yet unobtrusive service in an appropriately quiet atmosphere. 

What an amazing establishment!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Las Vegas for the weekend and I was craving for a good seafood restaurant.  I'm glad I chose Aquaknox. I enjoyed the decor of the restaurant with its underwater-like environment. I also saw the owner chef, Tom Moloney, walking around the dining room every once in a while. I think it was kinda refreshing considering not many of the owner celeb chefs work in their kitchens anymore. 

For my meal I chose the crab cake, lobster bisque, pan-seared grouper, and the interpretation on s'mores with peanut butter ice cream. There was an amuse of peppery bread sticks and smoked trout dip. Nothing too special but something nice to snack on at the beginning of the meal. The crab cake was good but since it was labeled \"jumbo lump\" you would actually see lump crab meat. I mean it was nothing but crab but the integrity of the lump was gone in the making of it. The lobster bisque itself was of total lobster essence with a few nuggets of lobster meat and a dollop of creme fraiche and caviar. The lobster was slightly chewy but, what the hell, it's lobster so I ate it with great gratification. The grouper was delicious as it was sitting on top of a bed of soba noodles, baby bok choy, and little shiitake mushrooms and all surrounded in a sea of lobster broth. The glaze on the grouper was sweet and a bite of spice from the sriracha in the glaze. Finally, the \"s'mores\" dessert was a chocolate mousse with graham cracker cookie bottom surrounded by milk chocolate and topped with marshamallow and accompanied with a small scoop of peanut butter ice cream. Very satisfying and a nice ending to a great meal.

Service I must say was very attentive, especially by the secondary waiter. The primary waiter who took my order was nice but was rarely seen after that. It looked like he was attending the bigger parties in his area. It was fine because the secondary waiter filled my water on time, asked me if I wanted a second helping of the smoked trout dip, asked if everything was OK with my meal, replaced my silverware at the appropriate times, and took my dessert order. So kudos to the secondary waiter.

My experience at Aquaknox was well worth it. I would definitely go back there if I had a craving for some great, fresh seafood with attentive service."}
{"text":"This was our first dinner during our trip to Vegas. We stayed at the Palazzo and figured we should check out what the hotel's restaurants had to offer. We were celebrating a birthday, so we did decided to go a little more high end. 
The ambiance of this restaurant is top notch- upscale and classy. Very beautiful decor, too.
Large , delicious menu with a seafood theme. 
Nice drink menu & lots of options.
Many people in our party had the Surf & Turf \"Special\" - nice lobster tail stuffed with a filet. Gorgeous presentation.
I had the tuna and it was phenomenal. Scallops were wonderful, too. Lobster bisque was very very nice.
I had a glass of wine - Sonoma Cutrer - for $22. 
Service was impeccable.

If you are looking for a cheap eat in Palazzo / Venetian.. keep walking. Come here if you want to splurge! Worth it! 
We had a group of 8 and they handled out party very well and efficiently. No problems."}
{"text":"Awful seafood. A small group of us stopped by for a quick bite of their oysters and scallops before heading to another hotel. Everything was incredibly salty and had a fishy after taste. It made us think they over-salted everything to mask the poor quality and freshness of the seafood. The waiters proceeded to say the saltiness was from the ocean, but c'mon salty to the point it made your face pucker??  They ended up comping us on the inedible items, which was nice... but definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. We loved the quiet round booths, away from the busyness of the Casino.

The Sea Bass was perfect!"}
{"text":"Ok, first time ever giving a 5 star review, but wow. Simply, wow.

Wife and I wanted to discover some new foods in Vegas, so the plan was to order things I wouldn't normally order. We also expected some over-the-top service and experiences. AquaKnox delivered on all of it, hands down. Please note, we're not really foodies, but we like great flavors and food, and we know good service...

From the first moment walking into AquaKnox we knew we were seeing something orders of magnitude better than our dinner the night before (at Canaletto). The service was impeccable. We ordered our meal and the sommelier came by to offer her recommendations -- she offered a great wine for dinner that was really excellent. As one would expect in a great establishment, the wine was kept chilled near the table, and we were frequently checked on and our wine was never low...

Our dining experience began with a really great amuse-bouche, delivered with the first pour of the wine. The single bit was a nice start!  For an appetizer, I started with the squash blossom appetizer, holding true to my \"I wouldn't normally order this, but what the hell\" approach for this trip. Wow. It was like experience the ultimate spring garden - the baby greens, pea shoots, delicately fried squash blossoms were all incredible. Perfectly dressed.  The best appetizer I have ever had.

For an entr√©e, I chose the whole sea bass and a side of the corn succotash (with edamame). The fish was perfectly cooked and very tasty, and the skin was incredibly crispy.  I found myself rationing the skin to enjoy it with every bite. The succotash was over the top good -- clearly nothing I had had the privilege of enjoying growing up!

For desert, I had the pumpkin cheesecake -- clearly nothing I would normally have gotten. Clearly I would have been depriving myself. The ginger caramel and spiced orange ice cream was an amazing compliment to the rich pumpkin cheesecake.

The meal ended with another single bite of chocolate and a refreshing lemon vodka.

From start to finish, AquaKnox single handedly delivered what we had hoped Vegas would deliver on. The service throughout was incredible and the food was always great and mind-blowing at times (wow, that appetizer). Despite my disappointing experiences elsewhere in the Vegas dining scene, I would come back to Vegas simply to enjoy AquaKnox again."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely incredible and so was the service. I highly recommend the grilled octopus to start."}
{"text":"Wow, really good meal here during the IBM Impact conference.  The thing here is seafood, and they spare no expense.  The large seafood appetizer had a little of everything, including an awesome little oyster \"shooter\" that was delicious.  I had the barramundi, which was tender, fresh and totally delicious.  Our hosts made this a special occasion too; fine food is always even better when someone else picks up the tab!"}
{"text":"My company hosted a large dinner party here And reserved the Chef Table. I worried a bit about how noisy it may be when we reserved the table but was pleasantly surprised to find it very quiet and not distracting to the conversations at the table. We ordered a four course menu offering our guest the ability to chose from three main dishes. The service and food was spectacular! We were served by 4 servers and found that they were very  prompt and professional paying close attention to drink refills and keeping the courses on track. We were never rushed and allowed to hangout and chat with our guest for as long as we required. Highly recommend for this type of event."}
{"text":"A solid 4.  

My stars:  (5=epic \"best of\") (4=really tasty and want to go again and again) (3=good and will go back once in a while) (2=fair, might return for a visit if there was some glimmer of hope) (1=avoid at all costs)

Go or No?  Go.

Tease:   Aquaknox is a seafood restaurant between the Venetian and Palazzo in Vegas.

Why I went:   My wife and I were craving a snack and drinks while waiting for friends to arrive in Vegas.

When:  11/17/12

Food:  We basically got the raw bar items and some tasty cocktails.  The crab, shrimp and oysters were all amazingly fresh and tasty!  Prices weren't outrageous, but they weren't cheap.  We felt the price matched the quality.  The cocktails were fantastic.

Service:   Excellent!  The bartender provided all for us.  He explained the cocktails as he made them, which was fun.  

Hints/Final thoughts:  Aquaknox is a chill nice seafood place in the Venetian/Palazzo.  It's worthy of a look if you're crazy some raw bar and drinks.  We really enjoyed it.  It was casual and fun."}
{"text":"The food here was great. Get the boulabaise and enjoy.  Im giving low marks for everything except the food here... 

The staff seemed all over the board on how well they did.  our server was great and did ensure everything was up to par, but the bartender was distracted and the rest of the staff doesn't pay attention once your inside.

My big complaint on this place:  LOUD, LOUD, LOUD and damned near pitch black dark.  

The food was GREAT.  But the music is at a 9 when a 6 would do (it was hard to talk, it was as loud as the nightclub nextdoor).  Up the lights a little bit so I can see your great tasting food."}
{"text":"Staying with my girlfriend at The Venetian, on our first night we decided to venture out into the restaurant row and try something for dinner. AquaKnox was the first place we came to, and we decided to just hop in and give it a shot. Wow. Could be the best restaurant we ate at the entire trip.
We were informed it would be about 5 minutes for our table to be ready, as it was pretty full, so we were sat at the bar. We were immediately helped by the bartender, and I ordered a sweet tea vodka / lemonade drink which was absolutely spectacular. The bartender was very friendly and gave us some tips on where else to eat and drink in the area, and after a few minutes we were seated at our table.
Love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Blue lights and blue drapes surround everything, giving it a very \"Aqua\" feeling, light music playing, and although the majority of people were dressed very well, the place had an upscale, but very relaxed atmosphere.
Our server was spectacular. Very professional and courteous, attentive, and took care of all our needs. The appetizers were unbelievable- love the smoked salmon puree given to you at the start of the meal. I had a seared tuna plate with cous cous for a main meal- un-f'n-believable. Could possibly be the greatest tasting food I've ever had. So fresh and tasty, it was perfect. There were lots of different choices as far as main course meals- you can definitely find something to eat as long as you're into seafood, that's for sure.
Overall, VERY glad we stopped into this place to eat, it definitely set the tone for the AWESOME Vegas trip we were about to have. Fantastic food, fantastic service, fantastic setting, it doesn't get any better than this. If you're staying in the Venetian / Palazzo, make sure you stop here. If you're on the strip and looking for good seafood, make a point to stop in and eat. Definitely one of the best, and I WILL be back."}
{"text":"Spectacular staff and ambiance. 

Located in between the Venetian and palazzo.. 

A fabulous restaurant that ceased to amaze both Matt and I. 

Upon arrival, we already had existing reservations made the day off, we asked for a nice booth (they're big, round, and give more of a private area although along side of the restaurant)

As we were seated, the hostess was THE kindest and warming young lady.. that also placed my napkin on me gently and properly before handing me the menu. 

What I enjoyed a lot is the tag team servers we had. As a duo, these gentlemen gave us an unforgettable dining experience. I feel so bad for forgetting their names but I believe they were of the Filipino descent. But seriously, it's like they read each other's minds. We would request something from one guy and bam! The other guy pops up with it in literally like 2 seconds. 

Onto food....

We started with 1dz oysters - varying with 3 different kinds. And may I say it was DELISH. 

Followed by the entrees..
Scallops - ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. Deserves more than 5 stars. If the spaghetti squash or squid ink pasta mix up TJ texture along with the perfectly mixed sauce... I just don't even know. Scallops we're cooked medium rare and it was perfect. 

Matt ordered a fish, that comes (mostly) deboned paired with veggies, such as potatoes, spinach and something else. But the fish had an amazing freshness to it and a chili flavor. You can get the fish either headless or with the head (your preference) 

We also ordered a side of chef's choose of veggies which worked in our favor. We had a zucchini lightly coated with Panko crust and some cheese flavor. The combination of crunchy panko and a perfectly cooked zucchini?!? A party in our mouths. 

We had a few kamikaze shots from the bar as well and they were fresh and STRONG. 

We ended being way too full for dessert, but the chef was kind enough to have us try his peaches n cream paired with a cheesecake cookie. 

If you're craving seafood, I highly recommend this place - as clearly it is their expertise along with outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Wow.  This was a meal.  The halibut with the lemongrass broth?  Are you kidding, it blew me away.   That was a dish that was thought out and was just perfection.  My buddy had the fillet, and that was just unbelieveable.  The most tender fillet i have tasted, and i get it all over the place.    I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best dinner we had during our trip to Vegas. Went there for my boyfriend's birthday and it was just PERFECT.
Starting from chef Jimmy to the sommelier and the waiters staff, everything was amazing!!!! 
We had a testing menu with wine pairing. Each dish was perfectly cooked and attentively described by our waiter. ( i truly apologize that i don t remember names, so sorry) . His assistant was a sweet girl and she was making sure the table was always clean and ready for next course. 
I can t thank them enough for the delicious food and the great service they provided us on that special occasion. 
Hope we can come back soon to Vegas to enjoy Aquaknox again."}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us that came here to celebrate our friends bday. Service was exquisite. They gave each and every one of us so much attention, despite us being so loud. Our server was Jesse and we would come back to ask us if we need anything else. He also ensured that we have everything we requested. Awesome services by Jesse that def made our night."}
{"text":"We reserved the wine tower room, which was surprisingly inexpensive but an almost surreal experience. The food and drinks were superb and the service was fantastic. Shout out to our server Jesse who was extremely attentive, answered all of our questions, and made some creative suggestions. A fantastic dining experience!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our 35th anniversary last night with dinner at the Aqua Nox and it was out of the park! Asparagus, Crab legs, Aquaknox Plateau - Good, great, BEST! The staff, in specific Jesse and Tonya, made us feel like royalty. It was fresh, delicious, and can't wait to go back for one of our upcoming birthdays!"}
{"text":"We recently chose Aquaknox for dinner on the night before our wedding.  The atmosphere, service, wine, and food were impeccable.   The experience was so phenomenal that we cancelled the reservations we had for our wedding dinner with another establishment because we could not imagine a better dining experience.  We came back to Aquaknox the next night after our wedding.  The staff were so great! When they found out it was our wedding celebration, they brought complimentary champagne for a toast.  It was another impeccable meal and the secluded booth was so romantic.  We ordered a cheese plate at the conclusion of our meal.  I was thrilled to see the chefs had written \"Congratulations!\" in chocolate on the rim of the plate.  Such a sweet and thoughtful touch.  We will be back to Aquaknox on our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Outstanding, soup to nuts.
Service is impeccable, food is amazing, just unbeatable.
I had the surf and turf and can't recommend it enough. 
Even though Aquaknox is a seafood restaurant, the filet was hands down the best steak I have ever had. The crab stuffed lobster is amazing.
Grilled lemons to squeeze on your crab and lobster? Oh yes indeedy."}
{"text":"One of the  \"must dine\"restaurants on my itinetary.   We enjoyed the food and service.
I had oysters, which were delightfully delish!  Wanted to try the shrimp and  grits, too yummy!!! Bigger portions than expected ( that's a good thing)
My entree was a \"surf and surf\", yes I asked for half a crab stuffed lobster and the king crab legs.  OMG !!! It was perfect!!!  As you can imagine the service was impeccable !! Whatever your heart's desire, the staff will try to make it happened."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for Valentine's Day this year. It was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. The food and staff was excellent! Our servers were Miller and Chris and I would definitely recommend them if you are going here. They were very knowledgeable and made sure we were well taken care of. We will definitely be returning next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on restaurants row in the Venetian Hotel.  The lobster bisque was excellent but very scarce.  It was a tiny creamer filled with bisque.  It had a nice piece of lobster. Very nice presentation. My husband ordered king crab legs for an appetizer and the waiter came over much later and said they ran out of king crab legs.  Dinner was okay.  The dessert we ordered which was ice cream and sorbet got lost somehow.  It came 10 minutes later.  Waiting for the check was another 10 minutes.  I've eaten better dinners in New York.  Save your money, not worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing oysters and fantastic food! Gin martinis are to die for and service is on point, thanks to Ian! We have been in Vegas 4 days so far the most hospitable and delightful bartender yet. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The best experience and the best food ever!!!
We were going to go to Cut after a whole day of playing at the craps table but opted to go here after the very nice hostess told us she could seat us right at 530. Mark and Miller were our waiters. Really? Two people to one table? Really! They were very entertaining and very knowledgeable. 

We were so happy with the presentation and the flavor of each dish! I couldn't help taking pictures of our dishes. They were just amazing!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 5 friends for one of their 21st birthdays.  The restaurant theme is 'global water cuisine' and the decor attempts to evoke the sea with waterfalls and aqua hued walls and ceilings.  

The meal began with an amuse of a smoked salmon mousse paired with breadsticks.  The mousse was smooth with a nice kick of horseradish and tabasco flavors.  We ordered a platter of 12 oysters for the table to start and then each ordered entrees: seared ahi tuna, scallops, and grilled whole fish.  The oysters (~$30) were the standout of the night: fresh, tender and perfectly briny, served with wedges of lemon and individually-sized bottles of Tabasco sauce.  Perfectly seared, slightly sweet scallops were served on a bed of sweet corn, mushrooms and chive-mashed potatoes.  The grilled fish was accompanied by wonderfully roasted cherry tomatoes which may have eclipsed the fish itself.  The seared ahi was technically perfectly, but the sauce was remarkably (overly?) strong and sweet.  Portion sizes were reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber and prices ran $35 - 40 per entree.  The birthday girl received, on the house, a lovely triangle of rich chocolate cake with a candle and a \"happy birthday\" engraved on a chocolate disk.  Finally, a small plate of complimentary rhombus-shaped chocolate squares finished the meal.

Aqua Knox also features an extensive wine list, off of which we ordered the Baileyana Chardonnay ($57), with the help of the sommelier who directed us toward our stated preference for something dry and oaky. 

Through the course of the evening we interacted with two waitresses and two sommeliers.  While all were pleasant, the upselling pressure  was immense.  We were continually directed toward wines more expensive than our preferred range and asked numerous times if we wanted to order more appetizers, salads, soups, and desserts.  Judging by our appearances (nicely dressed but very young) and our firm \"no\"s to all extraneous offers, I would think our price point was clear.  I'm not particularly sensitive to upselling, but the amount of marketing here was enough to leave me with unfond memories.

Overall, exquisite food but not particularly unique nor a great value (although it's hard to imagine that any of the celebrity restaurants in Vegas could be considered a great value).  A solid pick though if you're looking for exceptionally fresh (flown in daily) and well-prepared seafood."}
{"text":"Attended a private event here last week. OMG! Hands down... the seafood is phenomenal here at AquaKnox. It was kind of embarrassing how much I ate but when it is so fresh, nicely displayed and served with the best cocktail sauce I have ever had...well what is one to do at that point? The cocktail sauce is a little heavy on the horseradish so it has some kick. Ooweeee! This place is definitely upscale and expensive. Don't bring your kids or cheap friends here for drinks and dinner. The ambiance is romantic but hip. Located on restaurant row, you can't go wrong here when you're looking for an scale place to ha r dinner in Vegas. I will be returning to AquaKnox soon! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great service and convenient location within the Venetian hotel. Next to several other upscale restaurants. Primarily seafood items, but have steak or chicken options.  Dish prices range from $18-40 for most items, with a few items greater than this due to their specialty (e.g. Lobster, filet mignon, etc. ). Decent selection of cocktails and basic beers. If you prefer a variety of beers, then next door Public House is a better option."}
{"text":"AquaKnox is noteworthy aqua scooby snacks at its finest. Here's my 6-course tasting journey diary.

5th of all, 
I'm starting with dessert at the end. Imagine a tasting for every dish. My party of 3 enjoyed this ridiculous tasting of 9 gourmet ice cream flavors in its own. Some of which were the traditional, vanilla bean and mango passion, and then the untraditional- Thai iced tea, guiness, lychee, butterscotch. Chef from kitchen had fun by allowing us to guess flavors, and later coming out at the end to see what we came up with.

4th of all, for the steak lovers,
Glazed with green peppercorn sauce, the Prime ribeye(calf), folded to be seasoned inside and out. seared filet style for texture and juiciness sprinkled with Saba beans and baby carrots on a bed of potato corn pur√©e.  Ahh hosed with deliciousness.

3rd, seafood, yes their fort√©
How about that butter poached halibut in a bed of yellow tomato sauce. With eggplant caponata.

2nd,
Raw salmon seared with pumpernickel crust. Basil cream and basil blossom.  give me a break. I'm utterly in love with seafood more so. Stop. No. Don't stop.

1st of all, lobster bisque with caviar on top. Best 5,000 calories ever consumed(I'm over exaggerating on the calories) 

Bread sticks in a vase served with smoked fish mousse while we eagerly wait with our Shirley temps.

Primely, service is tops. These kids specialized in serving us very well, and describing each culinary dish as it was delivered. Mmm they know their stuff, it's obvious they do their kitchen homework. 

Note, 
We came for our best friend's bday and they treated her like a queen, so I highly recommend to spend your benjamin's at this place if you'd like to enjoy fine dining and freshest fish n primo meats."}
{"text":"What do you get when you build one of the most beautiful concept restaurants in the world and serve up subpar seafood dishes? Aquaknox at The Venetian!

Just to give you a vague idea of what to expect from this place...the crabcake appetizer is $15 and comes on a tiny plate with TWO ping-pong ball sized pieces. You would think for about $7.50 a piece, they should taste AMAZING, but no. You can purchase better tasting seafood prepackaged at Costco or Safeway.

So not only was it extremely expensive, the food was completely unappetizing, flavorless and our group left HUNGRY.

This is one of those places where your $45/person bill is paying for the decor and atmosphere, not your food.

Honestly, save yourself some money and take it elsewhere. Don't let the fancy decorations, designer chairs and tables fool you into walking in."}
{"text":"First time to Vegas. Expected a real knockout from the Venitian, however the Aquaknox was good but not worth the price of admission. It is overpriced i.e.: single  malt scotch $30 for a single shot.

Service was confusing. Wine was kept at a bus stand? Was easier to summon the floor manager than our waiters.

Food was very good; scallops were excellent. Lobster bisque was ok; seemed more like tomato soup as it was light on lobster."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Aquanox. If you haven't been to this delicious strip spot then you are missing out.

Located on resteraunt row in the Venetian, Aquanox offers a specialty menu catering to fine pallets with fresh ingredients and romantic ambiance. 

They have a really cool private wine room that is near the front that you can reserve for special occasions. Which I really love for privacy. 

The menu is on the shorter side, but sweet and to the point. Everything from their signature cocktails to the main dishes are phenominal and of course, individually priced!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a seafood based restaurant for my birthday dinner. There were many to choose from, but I'm glad that I came here. The place is dimly lit and listed as smart casual for dress code, but it's got a very upscale feel. They hosted a range of patrons. I was greeted and seated right away for my reservation. Both my servers were great and checked on me often. When it came to the menu, I had a difficult time choosing, but settled on the lobster bisque, a glass of proseco, and their stuffed lobster (sold at market price).  Their lobster bisque was probably one of best I've had thus far and that is one of my favorite soups to order. It did not have large chunks of lobster as I have experienced previously at other places, but the flavoring was so creamy and delicious. My stuffed lobster came with asparagus spears and the lobster was cut in half so I didn't have to work too hard to get to the meat. I did not have enough room for sweets, but my server still brought me something light in celebration of my birthday. It was a petit creme puff and a peach yogurt drink. Overall, I had a great experience because the delicious food and professional staff. Definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"Ordered the prawns and scallops. The scallops was amazing. The prawns was cooked to perfection but did not like it much. For the price I would recommend another location. Pretty pricey. The service was great though."}
{"text":"Simply too expensive For what.you get. I understand that Vegas is pricy, but 2 of us had a $150 bill with no liquor and I didn't have an entree (my friend did though).  I had a salad and crabcake , he had Alaska king crab salads and dessert was $125 before tip.  Crazy.  Seems that the slot machines aren't the only place taking your money in this town.  :(

Food quality was good, experience was nice so if you are on an expense account, then I recommend it. (I was because this was a business trip).. if it's personal, avoid AquaKnox"}
{"text":"my best friend and i were staying at the venetian on our recent trip to las vegas, and were looking to have a nice seafood dinner. i saw this restaurant on yelp, and we decided to try it since it got great reviews.

we started off our dinner with some drinks; i got the dr. heidemanns-bergweiler riesling and my friend got blue moon. the riesling was definitely one of the best i've ever had. it was very light and not too sweet like other rieslings. 

for our appetizers, i got the pacific prawns which came with a horseradish cocktail sauce, and my friend got the hollander mussels in a chardonnay herb butter broth. i'm not a huge mussel or clam person, but the mussels were super tender and the broth was absolutely delicious. my appetizer came with about five pieces of big sized prawns and a side of the horseradish cocktail sauce. the prawns were super meaty and you can taste the freshness. 

for the main course, i got the mt. cook alpine king salmon which came with a fall vegetable ragout, micro sorrel, and suace buerre blanc. since again i was watching the amount of sauce and fat in my meal, i ordered my salmon without the sauce and replaced the ragout with a side of steamed veggies. the salmon was about 6 oz which was a great portion, and like the prawns, was super fresh, flaky, and moist. my friend got the georges bank scallops, which came with clack truffle creamed corn and applewood smoked bacon polenta. she's not a huge fan of polenta, so she ordered a side of french fries instead. the french fries were thin cut and yummy! i didn't try any of the scallops, since it was topped with truffle oil and i'm highly allergic to truffle oil. but my friend did say it was very fresh and delicious. 

besides the amazing and fresh food, the ambience and friendly staff were out of this world. our servers were jesse and tonya, and they were super friendly and helpful. make sure you ask for them if you ever decide to try this place! jesse was very accommodating to my requests, since i was watching my caloric intake, and made sure that i was comfortable with my dish and the ingredients that were going into it. additionally, the food was not as overpriced as one would expect it to be. 

i will definitely be going back to this place the next time i'm in vegas."}
{"text":"Much like the rest  of Vegas, AquaKnox seeks to blend the contemporary with the trendy and it succeeds.  This is definitely one of the places to check out along a strip full of what I would otherwise consider sensory overload.  They have a private dining area sectioned off by a glass wall so it looks like diners are sitting inside a fish tank, which I thought was very cool. The atmosphere was relaxing and service proved that dining here was worth every penny.

Highlights off the dinner menu include jumbo lump crab cakes served over a bed of market vegetable relish and citrus aioli; seared fennel dusted ahi tuna; an upscale rendition of S'mores (yes ... but cleaner and no melty marshmallows all over your hands), ultra-smooth vanilla creme brulee, and a tasty, though not tart enough, lychee sorbet."}
{"text":"Date night. And we really loved it start to finish. This place is worth a stop. Seriously.  Don't leave Vegas without a truly great dining and ambiance experience. The food was awesome and the prices are very reasonable.  Don't be cheap you get what you pay for in life!  Shout out to Carlos and Brian, they made the whole experience and we can't wait to come back! If I could give 6 stars I would! Love love love!"}
{"text":"Service was nice. A bit on the pricey side. 
Really delicious butter lettuce salad. Each leaf has a different flavor.    
Atomic cocktail sauce was bomb too.
Not crowded, so very chill."}
{"text":"Convenient spot to grab quick seafood before seeing Blue Man Group. Nice aquatic-themed d√©cor but not memorable compared to the mega restaurants at the Wynn and MGM. Of the seafood trio, the shrimp cocktail was good (your basic red sauce with extra horseradish fire), the lobster was bland, and the other fish, whatever the heck it was, was delicious.

3-4 stars."}
{"text":"Jennifer made the most amazing drinks (off-menu and off the top of her head!) and was one of the most friendly bartenders I've ever met. Excellent service!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start ? This place was superb from the moment we walked in until the moment we left! Some of the finest service I have ever experienced! That place ran like a well oiled machine with every moving part performing at peak performance! Now let's talk about the food. Our server told us about the special which agreed to because he made it sound so delicious boy oh boy I'm glad I took his advice it was delicious! That was was the Best crab I have had outside of New Orleans it was sweet and buttery without dipping it in butter so so good. I asked our server how is that their crab is better the. Everybody else's and he said its fresh the fly it in everyday hence the prices! It was a little pricey but it was worth every penny. The mashed potatoes were excellent the asperaga's had a lemon sort of something to it the steak was cooked exactly like I asked topped with some sort of Asian pepper which brought out a whole other taste to the steak. Over all experience was superb! Highly recommend it if you are staying at the Palazzo or the Venetian or just go there if you are in Vegas! Bravo"}
{"text":"Short version: There's just a special kind of unacceptable disappointment for a place like this. When you charge a certain price, you expect a certainly level of freshness of the seafood and service.  This place lacks in both on the night that we visited.

Decor: 5/5
I really liked the look of this place... to the point that we were looking at hosting our wedding reception here but decided to check it out before requesting a proposal for our event.  Visually, I love it.

Cleanliness: 5/5
It was very clean.  No spotty silverware or glasses.  No random napkins under the table.  It's exactly what you would expect.

Food: 3/5
So the food was \"good\".  It's just not where it should have been for the price point.  We didn't get any bread.  I saw other tables with one, but we were never offered one. My fiance food it strange then was a bit upset when he saw another table with a bread basket.  The lobster bisque made you wonder what you were paying for and where the lobster was.  It's like a bad Scooby-Doo mystery.  My other complaint is around the fact that the seafood was really not all that fresh. I ordered the lobster dinner.  Many the local seafood places off of the Strip have fresher food. Many restaurants in the same range on the Strip have better quality seafood. I was really surprised by this with all of the accolades that they post on the website; however, if you see the plaques on the way to the restroom, they are from several years prior... and the food definitely tastes like it. (Correction: They were awarded in 2017.  Still baffling for me unless I just got a bad lobster. The service really has mad me quite grumpy. No excuse.  I should have fact checked this statement.)

Service: 1/5
I had the would have to say I've had the worst waitress that I have ever had in my entire life.  She took our order with a bit of a snotty attitude, and we didn't see her again until she dropped off the check and was looking for her tip. I couldn't tip her, and I always tip.  I ended up withdrawing cash in the casino and giving is to the assistant because I was told that if I put anything on the check that it would go to her. Not gonna happen!  Her assistant did the best he could but seemed new to this type of service.  He had such a willing, helpful attitude that it made you really lose sight of that... especially after dealing with the waitress staring at our table as she walked by but never actually saying anything to us.  I definitely got the impression that we were not welcome and/or wanted. I let the manager know my thoughts with examples when I left.

I would never host anything at this restaurant! It would be an embarrassment to have them deal with the service that we experienced."}
{"text":"Another Aquatic five star fine dining restaurant finally checked off my list without disappointment. Located in The Venetian Hotel & Casino 
We made a reservation through open Table on a Friday night . I actually had to call and change the reservation time twice and they accommodated me both times with no problem at all. I was surprised that when we arrived we were seated right away. 

Starters 

The Florida Pink Flamingo Ceviche: Lobster Roe, Lemon, Cilantro, shishito peppers & red chili tortilla strips. 
 Very Tasty! 

Truffle Burrata Salad came with 
Truffled Burrata shaved asparagus , summer squash, shaved heirloom baby carrots, fennel cream, dried shallots & top with some delicious sterlet caviar!

Crispy Kennebec French Fries 

I would actually recommend NOT ordering these. The waiter told us these were a \"must order\" and they were Definitely NOT a MUST ORDER. They were fresh but I go to inn n out burger all the time (who also makes their fries homemade) and they are very comparable. Very. So it wasn't necessary for me to order those. 

Entrees 

The Seared Sea Scallops were prepared with 
Fennel Pollen , wild mushrooms , crispy pancetta, romanesco crown, parsnip pur√©e and bee jus
It was unclear to me how this dish would turn out as I was unfamiliar with most of the ingredients.
I enjoy Scallops if they are cooked right, and they were. 
I noticed there were no mushrooms and broccoli instead. I would probably order something else next time however it was tasty ! 

We also had to go with the special on the Menu which were the  Alaskan King Crab Legs !  
( Served cracked chilled or hot)
These King Crab Legs were the real deal as I enjoyed every bite. I ordered mine chilled on ice which came with a mustard & cocktail sauce. If you like Alaskan King Can't go wrong with these. 

Next time I will order something with a little extra flavor like the Chilean Sea Bass or the Albacore 

The Service was really good ! We had one main server and a server helping him. The place wasn't too busy for a Friday night . The reason I like coming to places like this besides the food quality  is because of the service. There was a few minutes where I was looking around with an empty beer glass and shortly after they asked me if I wanted another. I was happy with Aquaknox."}
{"text":"Now here's a good place.

I didn't want to eat here; fish restaurant, weird location from my hotel, looked too trendy to have good food. I was wrong. Great meal.

We showed up with more in our party than in our reservation. \"No problem, just a minute to set up new tables.\" Cool.

I don't drink but we had a party of 12 and those that had cocktails loved them. There was the LV-usual menu of house cocktails.  The bartender was accommodating, but when one of our party wanted a house specialty without an ingredient, the waitress came back and explained that the bartender felt the drink wouldn't be enjoyable and would she like something different? She would and she did. They were good.

I ordered an appetizer and then I asked the waiter for his opinion of a dish. He said that if I liked {my appetizer} then I would really like (his suggestion). OK, I'll try it. 

Wait staff is young and smart. Not too chatty, but if you engage them, they'll talk. Just the right amount. They were quick, accommodating and professional.

I had the lump crab cocktail and steak Oscar, both very excellant. I should have had the steak cooked more than medium, but that was my fault. I didn't mention it, but I think if I did, they would have helped me out. I got that vibe off them.

Dessert was chocolate something and good. Coffee came with biscotti and were yummy.

Not inexpensive, but I got value, I think. Cool place, up-scale and comfortable. Not over-the-top good enough to be 5 star but getting close. I'll go back."}
{"text":"This place is impressive. The decor is straight out of Biff's penthouse suite in Back to the Future 2. Wide open and ultra modern with multi-level tables, but without losing that comfort zone at each table. The salmon was ridiculous and the wine was top notch. For the first time I actually savored each bite instead of going dyson on the plate. Like everything in vegas, it helps you lose weight... in the wallet."}
{"text":"I love this establishment!!! I really can't order seafood anywhere else. The crab bisque was so rich and flavorful, always a treat. I shared the shrimp and crab salad with my friend. It was so refreshing with the cantaloupe and avocado complimenting the greens and dressing. My entree was as delicious as ever, Prawns  with couscous and lobster cream. The service was outstanding as always. Sorry I was way to full for dessert."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying, the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because i wish the food portion would have been a bit bigger! other than that, This place is AMAZING!!

We started with the crabcake appetizers... they were tasty!
I had the new zealand salmon with lobster mashed potatoes-- The mashed potatoes were phenomenal! And the Creme Brulee (which i'm usually not a fan of...) COULN'T GET ENOUGH!! The Aquatini was sooooo good!! Usually not my kind of drink, but this was yummy!

It was a little pricey, but the customer service was impeccable... The staff was SO nice and attentive. We were there for my niece's 21st birthday and when i made reservations, i told them this. they remembered when we got there and made her feel so special throughout the night. It was a very special night and definitely memorable. :)"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful! A couple of friends and I met there on a break from the convention that we were attending. We sat in the bar area and it wasn't crowded at all.  We received no attention at all. We had to wave someone over to finally order water. The same for our drinks and then the same for our check. Of course, it's in the Venetian so our drinks were pricy. My friend said her martini was delicious so that earned the two stars."}
{"text":"Going to be tough to ever top the stuffed lobster here. Just be hungry because it's pretty big. We started with the crab bisque(way too rich for me, too much cream I think) & The Blue Crab app(thoroughly amazing!) & The Crab Cake(certainly an upper end crab cake with a nice meat to bread ratio, the remoulade is flawless!) & the Shrimp and Grits(holy flavor explosion, Batman! A must IMO). We also ended our meal with Absinthe, the full presentation and all, pretty cool."}
{"text":"Ok let me just say I am kinda picky. This was one of the if not THE best seafood dishes and experiences I have ever had. We started with the prawns in atomic sauce, cooked perfectly though sauce could have been hotter. Had cocktails all were superb, service was without a doubt exemplary. All of our servers were knowledgeable especially for Zach  and Kara they were sooooooo good at every aspect of the meal. Friendly, knowledgeable and ready to help with anything. Truly and exceptional meal and experience."}
{"text":"I know they are known to be a great seafood restaurant, but I ordered their duck dish which was surprisingly good.  I also tried my friend's scallop and it was perfectly cooked as well.  Definitely worth going back."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for next Wed at 7 pm. Two days later, Aquaknox called me and said \"We have a big party coming in on Wednesday and we can't accommodate your reservation, but we have an opening at 9 pm\". I'm going elsewhere. 
Not the kind of service I expect in a city focused on entertainment and trade shows."}
{"text":"Possibly the best seafood place in Las Vegas, Aquaknox is an excellent night out. The e John Dory and Lobster Bisque are \"must haves\". The service was the best we had in Vegas and one of the few times the service level equalled the food. The dessert menu is a little lacking, it's good but not outstanding. Overall I highly recommend AquaKnox."}
{"text":"Excellent upscale restaurant for all yoExcellent upscale restaurant for all you seafood lovers! The seafood was excellent here, the land entrees, not so much! The blue theme of the restaurant really gives you the feeling of being underwater as you enter. We were offered booth or table seating and of course we chose to be nestled up in our own secluded booth--more comfortable and a lot more privacy! Here is a list of what we ordered:

-Crab cakes: Bomb diggity! Probably hands down the best crab cake I've ever tasted. Their crab cakes were chunky and you can see that they used real crab and no imitation crab meat. Perfect to the touch that when it enters into your mouth, you can still taste the texture and consistency of the crab. Yum! The tartar sauce it comes with adds the perfect balance to the crab cake. Usually, I'm not a huge fan of tartar sauce because it is way too strong for my taste, but this one was just right. I'm so happy I gave this one a try!

-Oysters: We ordered 6 oysters to start off our dinner with (2 small, 2 medium, and 2 large). The smallest ones from Washington were yummy. The medium and large ones from Washington and Virginia respectively tasted mushy like they were pregnant oysters. Definitely sticking to the smaller sizes from now on.

-Fois gras: Served with a bread pudding (which I found to be quite interesting because bread pudding is usually served for dessert), a slice of bacon, figs, and greens. This dish was a mix of too many flavors and textures. The fois gras tasted very gamey to me. The bread pudding just didn't belong. The figs were sweet and chewy. The bacon was the only part of the dish that tasted normal to me. We didn't even finish this dish. Not a dish I would order again.

-Sea Bass: Yum! Yum! Yum! This sea bass melts in your mouth the moment you eat it. So delicious! Came with chunks of lobster, corn, and edamame beans drenched in the sauce it came with. Very simple and pleasant to eat. 

-Bone-in-ribeye: Ribeye came sliced for you over a bed of mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes outshined the ribeye for me unfortunately. The ribeye was drenched in the house sauce they supposedly \"drizzled\" over the meat. I think it would have tasted better if there was less sauce, so that I would have been able to taste the quality of the meat.

All in all, excellent restaurant! I would come again, but would definitely stick to ordering the seafood items here!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for some pre-dinner shellfish and I can't believe we didn't find this gem of a place before! The atmosphere was hip and fun - but the best part was he seafood trio, which - honestly - they need to
Rename this \"the motorboat\" that is seriously what you want to do to the plate when you finish this dish to capture all of the juices! This place is top notch and amazing!"}
{"text":"The Chef's Seafood Soup (entree) was awesome. I would suggest that and a variety of oysters from the raw bar. 

What I did not like was that the server was more concerned about 'selling' than my food interests. Upon ordering a significantly priced bottle of wine, he came back with a more expensive proprietary label bottle saying that I would probably like that better. Actually, I know my wine and ordered specifically to pair with my meal/my group's meal. When I asked why & what specific vineyard this wine came from- I stumped him into a babbling tangent with no specific answer.

In addition, they were really big on pushing their $80 seafood appetizer sampler. We were told that we should order that...\"it's best for a table of four like this\". Really? We more than happily ordered ~ $100 in appetizers but, did not see the value in the mish-mash of items on the sampler.

Bottom line, great food. Order what you want and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food - Excellent.  We had the prawns with couscous and the salmon.  Both delicious, fresh and aesthetically pleasing

Drinks - The ginger bourbon lemonade was AMAZING

Atmosphere - So-so.  You'll get a lot of passerby's looking in at you.  D√©cor is alright, nothing special.  It was also a little dead inside for a Wednesday at 8 pm.

Service - So-so.  When my husband and I made the reservation, we specifically indicated that we will have just gotten married and this would be our first dinner as husband and wife.  Unfortunately, no one said anything to us, not even a \"congratulations.\"  In the spirit of being totally candid, we were hoping for a little special treatment, perhaps some cocktails or dessert on the house.  Not a single thing.  That was a little disappointing.  

BOTTOMLINE - There are a million good restaurants in Vegas to try, I see no reason to go back to Aquaknox"}
{"text":"I wanted to grab a quick bite after an exhausting day at a tradeshow in the Venetian and AquaKnox was pretty much in the right place at the right time. I didn't feel like going on a mission to find authentic food outside the hotel and the place had just the right amount of people and volume for me to deal with (not too much, not too little). I took a seat at the bar and was helped by several very, very nice bartenders. It seems most bartenders in Vegas are a little on the jerky side, but this guy and girl were more along the lines of fine dining waiters than just bartenders.

My lite meal turned into a self made tasting menu of miyagi oysters, tuna tartar, and a butterleaf salad. One glass of white to start and one glass of red to finish. The oysters were awesome - served with a mignonette that made them pop. The tuna tartar had two sides to it - one was sliced and seared and the other was a true tartar. I would rather they just server a double of the tartar with some kind of eating vessel (like a fried wonton or something). The salad was pretty simple in ingredients, but it was perfect after the tuna and was presented in a beautiful blossom looking fashion. 

Tip included - about $120. Is that expensive? For burger king, ya. For a nice seafood restaurant in Vegas, not so much. That said, I did earn my \"High Rollers\" badge after checking in here on Yelp."}
{"text":"Wonderful service- delicious food.  Our party had oysters, ceviche, & shrimp cocktail to start;  Fish soup, steak, salmon, & albacore tuna for main; and bread pudding, Apple doughnuts and some orange champagne thingy for dessert.   I was feeling a little under the weather and the fish soup really hit the spot. My party had a great experience here- would definitely dine again."}
{"text":"LOVED. 

My parents are in Vegas a few times a year on business, and they always eat here their first night. I'm so glad we didn't skip their tradition when I joined them on their last trip.

Ambiance - a little modern, cool colors, white table cloths

Service - on top of it, friendly

Drinks - amazing

Food  - even better

Crab Cake Appetizer: 5 stars (and I don't like crab cakes usually)
Tomato Salad - 4 stars
Caesar Salad - 5 stars
Mango Ceviche - 5 stars
Salmon Entree - 5 stars
Butterfish Entree - 5 stars (AMAZING. Melt in your mouth goodness)
Jumbo Asparagus - 4 stars (light)"}
{"text":"Sure it's a bit pricey, but the qualities of the food, service, and ambience is on par with the prices.  If you go, I recommend the Clam Steamers to share with your party.  The taste of the clams cannot be duplicated anywhere else!  I am not sure about paying $8 for a bottle of H20, though.

Ambience- Hip yet classy.

Food- Good food, but I think you are mostly paying for the ambience and service.  Except the Clam Steamers were out of this world!

Service- Friendly, professional, and very attentive."}
{"text":"Jesse and T (tonya) served us tonight.  Not only was this the best meal we've had in Vegas..this pair was PHENOMENAL!!
We come to Vegas 3-4 times a year, this was our first visit to AquaKnox..the BEST steak (rival to Moos in Boston) and the BEST seafood (including fresh coast). 
But the food paled to our service..I would eat McDonalds if they served there..WOW! 
Eat here, ask for them..have a ball!  
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue as this restaurant has continued to put out extraordinary dining experiences that leave diners in awe when they remember how good the food, service, ambiance and overall meal was.  Usually a restaurant will hit a home run in one or two of the categories but to knock it out of the park throughout each facet is very rare.  Our meal started with the Aqua Knox Plateau.  Lobster, oysters, prawns, mussels, ceviche, king crab and ponzu oyster shooters.  If i posted the picture, i think it would be the only picture needed to have you stop what you were doing and book immediately.  Too much to say as each item could have it's own paragraph.  To say the least, everything on the platter was fresh, ice cold, delicious and appetizing.  We were then treated with the King Salmon Tartare and Warm Octopus Carpaccio.  Both home runs.  Then we moved onto sharing the Butterfish, Whole Sea Bass and Fennel seared Albacore.  They didn't last long on the table. One of the most important facets of our dining experience is the wine pairing and our server was one of the most knowledgeable service staff we have had in a while.  I let him order the wine for us and didn't regret a single taste.  It's very rare in this trying economy to find a restaurant with service staff that take that amount of pride in cultivating their own palate to ensure a smooth and wonderful experience for the customer, just have to save kudos to that.  This server could have easily been the AGM and see a very bright future in his culinary career. Our meal finished with a dual dessert of cheesecake and flan and both were spectacular.  I would go back to Aqua Knox in a heart beat and can't wait to experience a meal of this caliber in the near future."}
{"text":"The service was lacking. And weird and the wine service was awkward, serving a sauvignon without asking any questions. I've never had a $100 a person awkward dinner. Maybe they were leaving us alone a bit because it was our anniversary?"}
{"text":"What a great experience!  Friendly staff and terrific food.  Quite possibly the best meal I've had in Vegas.  Jessie & Kelly made the choices perfect for us. Wish all dining experiences could be Iike this. Must do!!"}
{"text":"I found this place off of google & I am so glad I decided to do our company dinner here! 
First off they gave us the private room which was very nice of them to do for us. 
The service was hands down amazing our waiter & staff was very attentive and professional.

Everything we ordered was amazing and I will include photos because I'm a visual person and I feel like everyone loves using photos to reference what to order.
We had for appetizer their seafood plateau, crab cakes, foie gras, lobster bisque, & Louie crab salad.
For entrees we had the surf & turf all around and boy was their steak delicious along with the lobster stuffed crab.

Overall I highly recommend this restaurant it definitely did not disappoint and the quality in service & food deserves more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I got invited to dinner here. I'm no major fan of seafood. Only seafood items that tickle my fancy is like, fish street tacos, or like....shrimp jambalaya. I'm NOT adventurous at all when it comes to seafood.
But I figured...sure why not? Lets give this a try. Yelpers = foodies right??

I ordered the infamous Lobster Bisque soup that everyone keeps talking about. And whoa....THAT BOWL WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!! Plus that small scoop of caviar on top of a crunchy bread stick a great additional as well. That was enough to get me half full.

My date suggested the Peruvian sea bass as our main dish. In the end, I was glad I agreed to his suggestion. I know fish is a healthy alternative. I normally drench my fish...or any type of seafood in lemon, peppers, sauces...all types of condiments. I like to mask that \"seafood-y taste.\" But THIS sea bass did not need ANY of that. It was flavorful enough for me...and I'm big on flavoring. Also, what I really liked about this was the addition of mashed potatoes with a slight hint of crab meat. These two definitely complimented each other. 

Making reservations is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner!! Our daughter came to the restaurant two weeks ago and we're here this weekend celebrating my husband's birthday with our family and we came to Aquaknox. Great food, great service!! Jesse Romero and Tanya were our servers. They were very personable never interrupting; just great service! We had steak and lobster. Best steak ever! Lobster was wonderful and had king crab legs for appetizer. Beautiful presentation and wonderful to taste. Will most definitely return."}
{"text":"We went to see a show at the MGM Grand (Ka) in july. After dinner at the Aquaknox with my girlfriend. 

Love the show want to recommend this show to anyone. I think it's one of the best show in Las Vegas. 

The Aquaknox is located in Venetian hotel and casino. After looking at menu,  we order Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes for Appetizer. My girlfriend order Whole Grilled Lobster and I have a Filet Mignon. Did not have anything for dessert because we did not have any room for it. But the dinner was very big portion I was unable to finish my main course. Good food, good atmosphere and good service.

{"text":"I would never have gone to a place like this if somebody else wasn't paying. It's your typical \"pay a lot of money to have some guy talk to you in an accent and serve you half a plate of food for $60\" kind of place.

They had a good selection of wine, and the filet mignon was good... but not something I couldn't make myself (even if it was sliced by the executive chef.. woooo)

The atmosphere made me feel like I was eating in the middle of an Ikea store, and we had to pay for water.

If somebody wants to bankroll my dinner I'll go back, but I have had $5 cheeseburgers that I loved waaay more than my $42 prawns."}
{"text":"My wife and i love this place!! Fresh every time , and amazing service. I'm a bit of a critic when it comes to dining out, but this place leaves me more than satisfied every time. Price for quality its perfect. The free range chicken is something i dream about lol and the lobster bisque o.m.g!! The bone in ribeye my wife loves every time. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great good, what else can you ask for. I had the Branzzino and the wife had the the Baramundi(sp). The fish was impressive"}
{"text":"We stopped into Aquaknox to get a couple pre-dinner drinks with a large group of 13 people. While I thought the cocktail selection here was unique, I thought it was a bit overpriced and not very good. 
My chief complaint was with the Shingoku oysters we ordered. of the 6 we had 1/2 of them has grit in them. Biting on sand ruins anything.
The service was the only highlight, considering it was only one girl taking care of the bar area, and she managed to take care of our large group without mistakes."}
{"text":"I felt that Aquaknox was OK, but not really worth the price. Started with the Tasting Trio, then the Aquaknox Fish Soup, and finished with Sorbet. Everything was just OK. It wasn't bad, but didn't really make an impression. The service was great, though. Brian did a great job! He was friendly, professional, and honest. The food wasn't anything I would write home to mom about. Considering the cost and the other choices you have in Vegas, it was a let down. If your company is paying, eat here guilt free. If you're paying, there are a lot of other places that are MUCH better...even for seafood."}
{"text":"Came here only for the bar.Don't order a dirty martini unless you know what you're getting into. It was straight up gin and a bad idea. Noobs. 

Pear martini was really delicious, but didn't make up for the rest. Tokyo tea wasn't very stiff, and appletini was easy on the 'tini. (I had to say it, thank you Dr. John Dorian.)

Bartender/waitress was hurrying us out at 11pm on a Saturday night. Wtf. She took away our candle! Yes, I put that in the yelp review."}
{"text":"This was my first ever fine dining experience and I have to say that I'm glad it was here at AquaKnox. I came here with a party of 6 for a bachelorette party, and our reservation was ready to go when we arrived. We were seated right in the middle of the restaurant, in full view of the bar, kitchen in the back, and all tables around us. The ambiance is dim, classy and modern; pretty much what was expected of an upscale seafood restaurant in Vegas. Most of our party were wearing black dresses so we were served with black napkins right away which was much appreciated. Our reservation was at 5:30 with the restaurant at about maybe 30% occupancy in my opinion which was great because the service was impeccable. Our waiter was very attentive and patient while us girls were taking photos. They took our orders right away and came back with updates every few minutes. They first gave us a sample of their crab risotto as compliments from the chef which turned out to be a nice little appetizer. Our main dishes probably came out in about 20 minutes which was perfect. I ordered the Ora King Salmon which was probably the best salmon dish I have ever had! The forbidden rice, peppers, relish on top was just phenomenal. Definitely worth it. We were all so full and decided to forego dessert, but yet again we received complementary ginger tea & madeleines, compliments of the chef. Such a nice gesture since we were there celebrating. Just a perfect dinner from start to finish. Would definitely consider coming here again."}
{"text":"I loved that salmon dip they brought us. MMMM.... my meal was soooo very tasty. I love scallops. They were so delicious. Mmmm mmm mmm. OH the place looked pretty cool too, nice aqua decorations. Our waiter was really nice. 

MMmmmmm"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! I needed to arrange a price fixed meal for two clients - Jessica was amazing to work with! The clients loved their meal. Thank you so much for being so accommodating!"}
{"text":"Delectably delicious seafood..The oysters were so fresh and the waiters were so welcoming..I did not want to leave! 

I ordered the lobster bisque to start and it was piping hot and full of lobster flavor and then topped with creme fraiche and caviar..On to the main: scallops, which were seared perfectly and served mid rare, but the accompaniments were rather bland, black truffle creamed corn and bacon bits in polenta.. both were tasty, but together they were too sweet and not enough flavor in either one to make the rest of the dish pop.. 

I tasted the birthday boy's 'Barrimundi' fish, and was blown away! The crisp skin had been carefully caramelized and the texture was similar to salmon and sea bass mixed.. mmmmMM soo good! The mashed chive potatoes underneath the fish were delicious and drizzled with white truffle oil...heaven!The deserts were decent, and the cocktails were phenomenal. 

Overall, a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Service was great with our two Brian's serving us
Food was spot on and very tasty. 
Last week I had the same type of bone-in rib eye at the Eiffel Tower at Paris not only was it more money and fatty, but couldn't hold a stick to how good this dinner was for less money

Thanks staff"}
{"text":"Where to go for dinner in Vegas?  That was the question of the night during a recent trip to Sin City.  Since most of our meals were pre-arranged catered events (we were in town for a convention), this became a rather difficult decision given our myriad restaurant options and only one night to dine out!  

In the end, my companion and I decided on Aquaknox.  We were both in the mood for seafood and some tasty cocktails.  I had been warned by other reviewers that the decor might be a bit cheesy (think 80s, Miami Vice, was what I remembered one reviewer wrote).  However, when we arrived there we were pleasantly surprised.  Surrounded by \"waterfalls\" on the windows and soft lights that changed from shades of green to blue, I actually felt a tranquil and calming influence instead of the modern, angular harshness that I had expected.  I ordered a Red Lotus martini and my companion had their signature Aquatini.  We found ourselves immediately relaxed.

We were both very happy with our appetizers and entrees.  The portions were perfect -- neither too big nor small, enough to satisfy my appetite without leaving me feeling too full.  My salad was loaded with ample servings of shrimp and crab.  The lobster bisque was delicious.  My grouper entree with the miso broth, soba noodles, shiitake mushrooms and bok choy was fresh and flavorful.  The scallops were seared to perfection.  

Above all, we were most impressed with the service.  We had about 4 waiters serving us throughout our meal.  Each was pleasant and courteous (not intrusive), explained their portion of the menu well, and not once did we feel an air of pretense.  Our experience at Aquaknox shows how a restaurant can provide excellent food and service without the snobbishness that too often accompanies upscale dining."}
{"text":"Atmospehere was good, service was fine food wad good but over priced and I have had way better for less... Not a repeat"}
{"text":"I had high hope for AquaKnox as they had plenty of great reviews from Google and Yelp. Unfortunately, they didn't perform to my expectations. The service was attentive and friendly, hence, the three stars.  The food was not impressive.  For starter,  the seafood was not fresh.  I had the AquaKnox plateau and their crab claws tasted frozen that have been thawed out prior to opening.  Additionally,  the claws were not open/ cracked properly so I had difficulty getting to the crab meat.  They did not provide any utensil to de-shell the seafood.  Second,  the shrimp ceviche was bland. No flavor.  It was not worth $79. Third, the $53 AquaKnox fish soup was \"meh\". Average. My mom makes an amazing cioppino soup that'll knock your socks off compared to their fish soup.

My visit was a disappointment. I will not be back to AquaKnox unless they serve the fish soup with a golden spoon. 

Edited - Almost forgot about the dessert! It was the best part of the meal.  Apple pie donuts with vanilla ice cream was delicious. The minced apples inside each donuts made the dessert unforgettable. If you do decide to eat here,  be sure to save room for dessert as it's better than the main course."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for my sister in laws to be bachelorette.  We had dinner here and were a pressed from time due to a show we had scheduled.  Zachary was honestly amazing and so accommodating to our needs especially since I'm not easiest guest.  Ordered oysters and a filet mignon Oscar. Everything came out to perfection.  Such a wonderful dinner with my gals!!! Zachary was THE best!!!"}
{"text":"Rarely have I been to a restaurant where the quality of the service was as amazing as the food.  Aquaknox is such a place.  The attentiveness of the Hostesses from the start made us feel so welcomed and important.  The booth seating is lovely as you can still be a part of the restaurant while enjoying the intimacy with your dinner guest(s). Our Server, Brad, was fabulous and extremely informative about our food and wine questions. The food was incredible!  My daughter and I started with the Tuna Tartare with Asian Pear infusion...delicious and so fresh it tasted like it had just landed on shore! Great combination of flavors. Anyway, onto an old classic, surf and turf...thought we'd give it a try. OMG, it was to die for! The filet was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife, and it was the perfect pink for med rare.  The stuffed Lobster (with crabmeat), was totally updated in flavor and delicious. Our server, Brad, described the Banana Cream Pie so well that we decided to give it a go...a wonderful decision on our part. It was the perfect flavor balance.  Frankly, my daughter and I are very knowledgeable about food and this was our favorite restaurant our whole time in Vegas. Brad, our Server, Adrian, who assisted and Melody, the Manager couldn't have been lovelier.  I cannot wait to return to this outstanding restaurant...Bon Apetite!"}
{"text":"Second helping of amazing!!

Came back for seconds on our last night in Vegas, we asked for our waiter from our previous trip who was amazing (Chris G). The staff including bartender that served us as they prepared our table, the front desk, even the ops manager made us feel amazing.

Today we ordered different items including a starter of lobster cocktail (amazing!) blue prawns, and finishing with a passion fruit chocolate marquis. Everything was cooked with care and had the most amazing flavors.

I asked the staff to pass on my gratitude to the chef. Jimmy the sous chef came out so we could talk, you can see the passion in his craft and he was very humble to hear about our great experience.

If I could give these folks another star I would, and I will be coming back again next visit.

Love this place!!!"}

{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Vegas for my 34th birthday and he made us reservations here in the wine room for my birthday dinner.  The wine room is so private and fun- I'd recommend it for anyone celebrating a special occasion.  We were seated quickly and introduced to our servers- Jesse and Tonya were both amazing! They had a seven course menu ready for us and had a wonderful greeting on the menu- welcoming us and wishing me a happy birthday.  The entire experience lasted about 2.5 hours and each course seemed more delicious than the last!  Our favorites were the lobster bisque, ahi tuna poke, and the main course.  The drinks were delicious as well! The food was amazing, but we also received the best service I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  Hopefully, Jesse's manager reads this- he was so personable and on top of everything. He was so accommodating and kind.  We want to come back soon and hope to see him again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our 10th wedding anniversary based on Yelp reviews. The service was 5 stars- very accommodating and attentive. I was really underwhelmed by the food- I'd give it a 2. Bread service was overly toasted ciabatta slices with bland butter. We ordered the oysters and shrimp cocktail to start. Just average. For dinner we got the wild Coho salmon. It was not only over cooked and dry but very very salty. I did not want to spoil the mood so I ate it. The filet mignon then came rare when we had ordered it medium. Again I ate it but they did redo my husbands portion. The mashed potatoes it came with were cold. The restaurant was not that busy. Maybe we would have fared better with the crab or lobster but I expected more from the fish dish. Like I said I cannot complain about the service- it was excellent."}
{"text":"Freshest oysters and clams : ) 
Great place for drinks and appetizers. 
They have the best dirty martini with blue cheese olives."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked into Aquaknox for our last meal before leaving Vegas. It was my favorite meal of the trip.  I go to Vegas pretty often, and I do my best to try different restaurants in the city. Since there are many, many restaurants in Vegas to try, I would have to love the place to go back again.  This is a place I would definitely try again. 

The service was great as well.My friend dropped a little cocktail sauce on her white shirt and was trying to wipe it off with a napkin when the waiter immediately appeared and dropped off some soda water. They were so quick and attentive, it was very impressive.

We tried a bunch of appetizers and the seafood plateau. Let me tell you, that seafood plateau thing is to die for. It has clams, mussels, oysters, prawns, ceviche, lobster, crab, and ponzu oyster shooters (the yummiest oyster shooters I've ever tried). If you love seafood, you HAVE to try this. I can't even remember what other appetizers I ordered because they were good, but paled in comparison."}
{"text":"Super good food, lobster bisque and barramundi was great.  I also liked the tag-team servers, we were never left unattended. 

Lost a star because the wine cellar was a circular fixture which should have had a water installation around it, but the water wasn't running and it looked dirty, like plexiglass with bad hard-water stains. It could have been so cool, but just looked like a dirty eyesore in front. Bummer.

Lost the other star because the bar wasn't bussed. I sat at the bar waiting to meet clients around 7PM. There were dirty glasses and dirty plates. The bartender walked passed them about 5 times before he picked the stuff up. A restaurant of this caliber should be more on the ball. I was the only one sitting at the bar, so it wasn't like they were overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Best surf and turf I've had.  Blue crab stuffed lobster was perfect.  Filet was good, although I would have preferred a bone-in.  As expected in Vegas, top-notch."}
{"text":"Food was not overpriced, and delicious. Steak was great, tad dry but much better then anything else I have had out here. Lobster was cooked to perfection. Ono was lightly breaded and enjoyed. Clams were spectacular!!!!!!! The martini's are worth the money.

Atmosphere was elegant and the ambiance was serene.  This is a high class restaurant that could be compared to a Morton's.

Service was excellent, servers team up and take care of tables together. Our every need was attended to. Manager did stop by our table twice.

My sister's birthday was the celebration, and we were dressed to the t, but It seemed they were giving everyone this type of attention. They comped and brought us a free dessert for the celebration and made the evening an unforgettable one."}
{"text":"This was, hands down, my favorite meal in my inaugural trip to Las Vegas, even though none of us anticipated the high price tag. I still think about it, a lot. Too much, even, probably.

I didn't realize that they closed at 10:00 that night and, when we walked in at 9:30, we were welcomed graciously and seated/attended to promptly. Service throughout continued to be excellent, even after we found out that they were closing in just a few minutes.

I was in the mood for scallops, but after the waiter's incredibly convincing description of the shellfish platter, we opted for that as an appetizer, as well.  It was amazing... and this is coming from someone formerly (and still a little bit) afraid of removing the exoskeleton of crustaceans. He gave us an extra oyster shooter, too, since there were three of us and the platter was only designed for two. The bottle of red wine he suggested (I don't remember what it was, I was too enraptured with the seafood platter) went perfectly with the meal, too. I still ordered the scallops and, while I remember them being tasty (and they left out the bacon in the polenta on my plate), that seafood platter won the meal for me.

And for my trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night around 8:30 for dinner with my boyfriend.  We had reservations but if we hadn't, I'm sure we would have been seated on this particular night since it was not crowded.

I agree with another reviewer who said the decor reminded them of South Beach.  I thought the same thing walking in with all the blues and whites. Very pretty and chic.

I was feeling kind of sick and can only vouch for the EXCELLENT lobster bisque and jumbo lump crab cocktail that I had. 

My boyfriend, on the other hand, had the Surf and Turf \"special\" which he said was very good...but much like any other steak and lobster he's had in other upscale restaurants. I guess the only thing special about it was the $85 price tag. 

Still 4-stars to AquaKnox because we enjoyed everything AND the service was top-notch.

Another plus: I wasn't drinking and one of the waiters asked me why not...I told him I wasn't feeling so great and  in 2 seconds, he brought me a pretty blue drink.  I don't like colorful (translated, sweet) drinks but tried to drink a little. I didn't like it and tried to just let it sit there but the waiter said he would make it less sweet and brought it back.  He was trying so hard to make it better. I ended up just apologizing that I didn't drink it.  However, I thought it was a sweet gesture that he didn't have to do."}
{"text":"Man, I so wanted to like this restaurant.  I really did.  I needed an awesome seafood restaurant within the Venetian.  Instead I found it being rather mediocre... average at best, with some things being good and others being weak-to-bad.  And this is on two occasions to visit.

MENU OVERHYPE
I remember when I got to look at the menu for the first time, I licked my chops because the dishes looked fantastic.  For a seafood nut like myself, this looked like it was going to be heaven-on-earth.  But very consistently, the dishes were a disappointment.  It's as if the marketing hype of the menu was simply too hard for the kitchen to match.

ALL ABOUT SEAFOOD
I gave them a fair shot however.  When in a seafood restaurant, eat the seafood.  So I ignored the chicken & beef dishes and concentrated on the fish & crustaceans.  (Note these are dishes order over two dinners on two separate days)
-- Seafood Trio:  3/5 --- Mixed bag
-- Lobster Bisque:  2/5 --- Borderline Campbell's-worthy
-- Ahi Sashimi & Tartar:  3/5 --- Tuna was clearly refrigerated for a while
-- Crab stuffed lobster:  4/5 --- The only good thing during the dinner
-- Grilled Jumbo Prawns:  2/5 --- Lukewarm meat
-- Coconut Jumbo Prawns:  2/5  --- (Chef Special) WAY over-battered, more bread & coconut than shrimp
-- Alaskan King Crab Legs:  2/5   --- (Chef Special) Cold!  Unintentionally.  Sent this back to get reheated.

COLD FOOD?
Unfortunately, my feedback on virtually all the dishes that we were served was that either the dish was bland or it was straight served disturbingly luke warm.  Part of this could have to do with the fact that the service was consistently slow during both my visits.  I had to lasso a waiter during each visit - during a slow time during the day, mind you - to check on my wife's & my dishes.

WELL... IT'S EDIBLE, I GUESS:
Ultimately, however I'm not sure that it mattered.  I never found myself savoring any of the bites I ate.  I never found myself going, \"Mmm... that was goooood.\"  I never thought, \"Where's that menu at?  I think I'd like to try something else on my next trip!\"  No, I pretty much toward the end of the meal conceded, \"I'm not into really anything that's been served.  At all.\"  That must be a record.  Usually at least one thing really stands out, and gets my juices flowing.  But not here.
...The exterior of this restaurant is very attractive and with all the water imagery, I would think it would drag in a pretty good customer base so I have to believe that it'll last a while no matter how weak the cuisine is.

CONCLUSION:
This isn't a place I'm going to go back to, no matter how pretty or convenient it is for being at the Venetian.  I value my dinners too much to put up with mediocre food.  For this kind of money, I still say that Rosewood Grille has the best lobster & crab.

2-Stars."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner here this evening with an old friend and business associate.  It was early and we had spent a long day at the Las Vegas Convention Center.  We needed a good quiet quality (yet light) meal in the Venetian Hotel.  So as we strolled Restaurant Row we came upon Aquaknox.

We were seated at a nice quiet table with very comfortable chairs.  Mine was a bit broken needing some repair.  However, I was exhausted and had no desire to get up or say anything.  Spent some time sipping on an ice cold beefeater gin and tonic simply relaxing.

The Fish Soup as an entr√©e ($46) sounded like the perfect reward for a hard day.  2 of us chose the Fish Soup and one of us opted for the salmon.  Note:  Our waiter Hilton was wonderful.

The soup was delicious.  Huge New Zealand mussels in a lovely tomato broth with lobster, massive shrimp and clams.  Crusty pieces of garlic bread complemented this lovely concoction.  There was some kind of rise or quinoa in the soup.  It was a wonderful dish - bottom line.

For desert we split the ice cream trio.  There were three flavors yet only the cinnamon truly stood out.

Bottom line - great meal.  Will I eat here again?  Absolutely.  Nice to find good food in a strip hotel (finally)."}
{"text":"Einen Abend im Restaurant AQUAKNOX sollte man sich g√∂nnen aber sehr viel Dollars mitnehmen... muss man einmal erlebt haben... dieses Restaurant ist spezialisiert auf alles was aus dem Meer kommt..."}
{"text":"The seafood is exquisite. The prices are high, perfect place to go when someone else is paying the bill or for a special occasion. Dining room is comfortable and the noise level is low. Service is top-notch. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Che dire, il locale √® molto bello e in stile moderno. All'interno della struttura Venetian di Las Vegas. Cucina di pesce ben presentata e lista dei vini ben fornita. Unico difetto, costa una schioppettata !!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, great decor, hip, fresh look and ambiance. Service was exceptional, good wine selection, and the meal was top notch. Crab leg appetizers, main meal was a perfectly prepared Halibut, and the cheesecake was a great finish.

Great place for a dinner!"}
{"text":"Flies...And honestly, there are too many other restaurants in Vegas to waste a nice dinner here..My date and the amuse bouche were the best things there."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends in celebration of a friend's graduation. Service was very friendly and attentive. Food was DELICIOUS. Some must orders would be the: Surf and Turf (if you are seriously hungry! LARGE portion and beautifully plated), lobster bisque, and the JOHN DORY with lobster succotash. It seems that most of their dishes have a touch of truffle (mmmyummdillyumcious) Prices are reasonable for the quality and portion sizes. For dessert they offer some traditional dessert selections as well as a menu with absinthe. We had two people at our table that ordered the absinthe desserts and both included a great show/explaination. Definitely are great place if your in the mood for fine dining and something lighter than the regular steak house."}
{"text":"I really wasn't expecting much from Aquaknox.  My mom and I ended up eating here only because Tao had a long wait, were were doing Bouchon the next night, and nothing else, besides the random food court junk, was open in the Venetian at 10pm.  

We shared the steak salad, the lobster bisque, and the pommes frites.  Everything was surprisingly incredible.  The bisque was probably the best I've had--not too creamy with bites of lobster that melt in your mouth.  The steak salad was delicious, and had more meat on it than I expected.  The dressing was perfect (though it's exact flavors escape me now).   The frites, while good, didn't come with any dipping sauce.  They weren't so spectacular that they could stand on their own so I would have liked a nice aioli or something.  

I wouldn't make a point of going back, but for a late night dining option at the Venetian, it was a good find."}
{"text":"What a beautiful and tastefully decorated place...  We started our dinner with Aquatini and boy were they awesome!!!   Then we were seated shortly.   We started our meal with  2 order of Seafood platter, Caviar, and few orders of beet salad, and green salad.  They were all wonderful...  There were five of us.  3 of my friends got the Surf and Turf ( ribeye steak & lobster),  my other girlfriend had crab stuffed lobster, and I had the lobster bisque soup, and  Day Boat Scallops. 
Follow by few of their dessert plate.  Yeah I know we LOVE to eat!!!
Here are the Pros...
OMG!!!! My Lobster  Bisque Soup was by far the BEST I've ever had....  It was to DIE for... So creamy and delicious!  Also my scallops were fantastic!!!  They were seared perfect!!!!  They just melted in my mouth!
Also, their service was excellent...  It seems like we had multiple staff wait on us...  We never once had to ask for anything...  
Here are the Cons.... 
We had a very hard time with their wine list... For the quality of food and being an upscale restaurant their wine list was mediocre...  We started off with ZD Reserve, which was an okay wine... But I can get that from BevMo for $45.00... Our second bottle was 2002 Far Niente which was better then ZD but still weren't very impressed.  
Another thing, the lobster was bit tough... We had hard time cutting the meat so one of the wait staff ended up cutting out the meat for us...  
Last thing, which is no big deal, but they ran out of Beluga caviar so they had to run to next door to get lower grade caviar...  :(  
If they had a better wine list, and we didn't have any issue with the lobster I would have given them 5 stars...   Also, it is bit pricey...  Our bill came out to $1,550.00 for party of 5...  Then again we felt that we deserve a good food now and then.... So it was worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here and the oysters on the 1/2 shell were deeeelish! They're even better when someone buys them because they like your friend and are trying so hard to impress.

We never made it to a table but sat at the bar for drinks. Xavier, the bartender, took good care of us. This isn't the first time I've been here for drinks... and it won't be the last."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to do in Vegas is to eat nice dinners, and my meal at Aquaknox did not disappoint.  Jesse, our server, was one of the best servers I've had.  He was so knowledgeable and quick with answers when asked for recommendations, which were always on point.  I had the scallops, and my husband had the halibut.  Both were delicious (as was the ahi appetizer), but the butterscotch bread pudding stole the show.  I'd highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice meal with excellent service."}
{"text":"Wow, can I be any less classier after going to this amazing seafood restaurant?  The dish I ordered was newly added to the menu, Porcini Dusted Moonfish, was delectable.  So delicious that I ate every morsel off that platter and literally licked the bowl clean.  

I would also recommend their crab cakes.  It has a great crunch to it and filled with flavorful crab meat.  Desserts...you can't go wrong with any of them I tried 4 of them.  The servers are very well versed with the menus and offer great advice and suggestions."}
{"text":"Shrimp & crab salad awesome, as well as the fresh oysters, great service."}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday (9 pm) and the restaurant was nearly empty. Service was great and the food was delicious. You will pay dearly for dining here, but if you're looking for a great meal look no further. The fish soup was delicious and he surf and turf was great. I am not a big lobster fan because it's usually over cooked. This lobster was perfect along with the filet mignon - medium rare was truly medium rare here. There were some nice touches - a small plate while we waited and after dinner another small plate."}
{"text":"Well now this was a treat for sure. Armed with my Eating Las Vegas review book I was determined to dine in style this trip. We, however, wondered into AquaKnox that was not in the review book.  Good move. Great waterfall entrance and exciting menu drew us in anyway..  Great choice.   I had the John Dory that was simply magnificent. Seared to perfection with a lobster succotash to die for.  Lobster bisque starter is a must try and a reasonable wine list yielded a Chablis that was wonderful and highlighted the meal well.  Lesson learned.  Review books, even the most acclaimed should not hinder your effort to find great dining were others have missed...  Service as good as the meal also.   Don't miss it if in town."}
{"text":"We couldn't get a table at Emeril Lagasse's place. So, we ended up here it was in the same hotel. The Oysters on the Half Shell and Tuna Tataki and Tartare was okay but pricey. For my main dish I had the Crispy Duck Breast. Pretty good it was a good thing I stay up the whole night after that dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I made a reservation at the restaurant as we were seeing a show at the Venetian. They asked are we celebrating anything and we said our anniversary. 

We arrived at our scheduled time and we were seated in a quiet booth, very comfortable.  

We were greeted by our waiter,  took his recommendation on wine and placed an order of little neck clams that were out of this world. 

Dinner was tuna and a small seafood sampler platter that was out of this world. 

The entire staff was fantastic, made friendly conversation and treated us very well.

For our anniversary they brought out a complimentary dessert, very yummy."}
{"text":"Hands down!! 5 . I know we were a bit loud and rowdy but it was all in the name of being with good friends and enjoying good food!  This place has a LOT of class!  From beginning to end they're spot on!  From palate cleansing foods, to fresh lemons and hot towels to cleans your hands, they left no stone unturned. I think Mike and I can't remember the young lady name.... but they were awesome. 

As I said I know we weren't the \"usual bunch\" that comes to 5 star dining but we weren't treated any different or our servers didn't seem \"put off\" by our being ourselves.  And we all agreed and appreciated that. Stark contrast from the next night where we ate at Mortons Steak house who couldn't hold a match to the Auqanox. 

So kudos to this restaurant. Everything we ordered was beyond good. Here's a few pics."}
{"text":"I love seafood, but for me this place was Aqua Not.  The list of transgressions:

  - Server didn't know what a Pimm's Cup is, and then the bar had no Pimm's
  - One of our party ordered iced tea and never got it
  - Asked for more breadsticks and never got them
  - Ordered the John Dory.  When it was brought out they said \"here's your halibut\", to which I replied \"John Dory is halibut\", to which the next guy who showed up at the table said \"we were all out of the John Dory so we gave you halibut\".  On top of that the fish was dry and as unispiring as the dessert menu, and none of my companions were particularly impressed by their food
I expect better when I'm paying $345.79 for a party of 4.  If you are stuck going here, the one highlight was the smoked fish appetizer.  Well-executed and delicious"}
{"text":"Had the tomahawk wagyu steak (medium), and it was perfect! Super melt in your mouth action. 

What was the star of the night was actually the dessert - the bread pudding. I could easily eat 3 of those in one sitting."}
{"text":"I was at a conference at the Venetian all week.  For dinner, one of our vendors took 10 of us to Aquaknox for dinner.  We started off with a couple bottles of pinot and cab and got a spectacular appetizer containing lobster, crab, oysters, prawns, and ceviche.  I'm not a huge shellfish eater, but it all tasted wonderful.  Next was the main course and since the vendor was paying, most of us got the surf and turf which was a mouth watering filet and a lobster tail stuffed with some crab as well.  Everything was top notch and our server was excellent as well.  Unfortunately due to too much wine, I do't recall his name."}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal!
Aquaknox continues to provide a unique dinning experience. the menu is updated frequently enough so that each time we come into town there is a new treat to enjoy. We love the \"out of the box\" imagination of the new head chef, Deric Meininger. One of the taste sensations he created was an octopus carpaccio. Never has an octopus dreamed of being so tender! The creation process itself; cooking  the octopus and then allowing it to form as it cooled into the round that made the thin slices possible, genius. Chef loves fresh herbs, and used along with crisp  black olive bits, shallot, and a vinegarette that compliments rather than overwhelmed. Truly like nothing I have ever had and tender beyond belief.

Min Lee, our most gracious host, sat us in our favorite booth and as always the wait staff served impeccably.  BTW the booths are very romantic, just enough privacy to steal a kiss, but not so much that you feel cut off.

Husband loves the Aquaknox crab cakes so much that he ordered two as a main dish. We've had crab cakes in New England that paled when stacked next to these. Topped with lump crab, a creole remoulade and accompanied by a chayote carrot and daikon. 

I had welsh sea bass, perfectly deboned and served over fresh arugula tossed with squash and zucchini and peewee potatoes. Again chef Deric's love of fresh herbs gives this dish the right finish. Even the fish skin was an edible delight, and I normally  don't like that part.

The only restaurant that even comes close to Aquaknox in my heart is Osterica Gardenia in Venice Italy!  Suffice it to Say that I have never had a disappointing dish at Aquaknox. I cannot say the same for some of the overrated and underwhelming Rao....skip the at Caesars and head to Aquaknox instead. 

We paired our meal with a lovely Delaporate Sancerre, perfect compliment. Oh, and dessert! Try the banana cream pie. Nothing like this reinvention of a classic. From the caramelized sugar atop the fresh banana slices to the delicate lady fingers base, the banana cream and served alongside a scoop of chocolate grand mariner and chocolate sauce. The sommelier brought us a desert wine to try, and I wish I had writen down the name as it was very good and not cloyingly over sweet. 

We finished with a Warm Amaretto Cherry Milk served with brown sugar white chocolate swirl cookie. 

All I can say is Aquaknox continues to impress."}
{"text":"If there were half stars to give, Aquaknox would get a 3.5.  It is really good, but not great.  First of all, the lobster bisque is fantastic and was the highlight of the meal.  It had a light amount of cream, wonderful lobster chunks and a dabble of caviar on top.  Probably some of the best bisque I have had in my life.  One member our party had the fish soup and raved about how fantastic it was.  I had the John Dory and it was really good.  It came prepared with a corn and fava bean relish which was light and tasty.  We were told that Aquaknox is known for its John Dory so we expected to be blown away.  It was really good, but not something to be \"known for.\"  What really took this restaurant from four to three stars was that a couple in our group ordered the $68 surf and turf special.  It came out luke warm.  Our waiter took it straight back and cooked them new entrees and the manager apologized, so I have to compliment the service.  However, a $68 meal should never come out cold.

The decor is uber trendy and fun.  The wine list is extensive and the atmosphere has a great vibe.  Our service was spot on and our waiter answered all questions without hestitation...and with this group, there are always a lot of questions.  We enjoyed our meal, but would probably choose to go back to Delmonico's next door over Aquaknox."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a Valentine's dinner at AquaKnox.  Overall, it was decent for a nice seafood/steak house, but not amazing, and was very expensive for what it was.

My wife and I both had a filet and stuffed lobster tail.  The lobster was perfectly cooked and very good.  Many places overcook lobster a little and it gets a tad dry, but this was cooked extremely well.  It was stuffed with crab, which was done well.

The filet was disappointing.  On the one hand, it was perfectly cooked and one of the most tender steaks I have had in a long time.  On the other hand, the flavor was very unfortunate.  It tasted like a pot roast, but not in a good way, and a bit more bland than a good pot roast.  Steak isn't supposed to taste like pot roast.  My wife added a bunch of salt and claimed it tasted better but still a lot to be desired.  It's a shame, because the steak had a lot of potential.  I'm not sure what kind of rub or whatever they put on it, but it was not an enjoyable flavor for a nice steak.  There was some kind of sauce that was pretty good, but not good enough to cover up the flavor of the steak.

We finished the meal with the apple strudel, with chai tea ice cream.  The dessert was first rate.  The ice cream was very memorable.  It made me forget about the steak.

The service was outstanding.  

Overall, if the steak had been up to par for an expensive steak and seafood restaurant, I would have given AquaKnox five stars and it would be on our short list of favorite restaurants on the strip, because everything else was at a five star level.  But for the price, the steak needed to be good.  It was not close.  It's a shame.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"There is a lot of restaurants all over Vegas and I have seen this place tons of times and decided to give it a try.  The setting is nice, but the beer selection is so so.  I wanted a Stella or NewCastle and had to settle for a corona.  They have lunch specials, I had the Lobster Bisque, which was ok, I have had better.  The crab cakes on the other hand was really good.  It's worth a try, but don't think I'd try again."}
{"text":"I really wish the food had lived up to the ambiance and service. I dined here on a Saturday night with five other ladies before a night of clubbing. The decor is beautiful and the restaurant has a good vibe to it. Our server was extremely nice, attentive and joked around with us a lot. Plus they had the Penguins hockey game on which made a few of my dining companions really happy. We even made friends with some other diners who happened to be Pens fans as well!

The food was just mediocre though. I had the romaine heart salad (blue cheese caesar) and crab cakes. I am picky about crab cakes and have very high expectations. I did appreciate the lack of filler but there just wasn't enough jumbo crab meat in them. Plus they had a weird buttery taste which I did not enjoy. The salad was a nice size and was good enough, but not great. It had a little too much dressing on it for my liking, so I would recommend getting it on the side. We also had two bottles of Chardonnay, but the name of the exact bottles we had escapes me. The wine list is extensive and has a variety of price points which was helpful especially in a group.

I wouldn't return to Aquaknox to dine, but it is a good place to grab a drink or two before heading across the hall to VBar."}
{"text":"Went here last summer. Everyone in our group ordered the seafood platter which came out on a iced tiered serving tray. There were clams, oysters, shrimp, crab and a teeny tiny lobster tail. The clams and oysters were soo not fresh, it didn't taste of the ocean at all...it had more of a pungent unmentionable taste. And it wasn't only one of them but the entire tables. The shrimp were decent, you can't really have a hard time finding decent shrimp. The crab was dry and had that ammonia taste and smell to it...yuck! The teeniest tiniest lobster imaginable was dry dry dry. Way over priced for that quality seafood. But, the dining area was pretty cool, but not cool enough. Never again!"}
{"text":"I loved the decor in Aquaknox, it is so beautiful, just amazing. The Aquatini is a must. The group had a seafood platter -- a nice assortment of raw fish and a great oyster shooter. This is a nice start actually very filling. Another must is the lobster bisque soup -- truly a must. I had the crab stuffed lobster which was really very good and tasty. The lobster was tough I could not cut it out of the shell. My friends were disappointed in the wine list we had two OK bottles of wine in my opinion. The services was great. 
I don't know if I would go back to this place for anything other than the Aquatini and Lobster Bisque. I enjoyed my meal but there are so many other places to try. . . .
if you have not been go you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, wonderful waitstaff and great food. I came here for a corporate dinner with over 35 people and everyone did such an awesome job accommodating everyone. My wine glass was never even close to empty the entire night! The prawns were out of this world, the seaweed salad was the freshest I've ever had and the tuna was cooked to perfection. I know the place is a little pricey but it's worth every dime."}
{"text":"Wow! I love this place!! Every bite f the food is FANTASTIC!!! Wow! Cesar salad my gas and had - best best!! I had a crab salad - uf uf!! Amazing!!! My lobster and stuffed with crab -ah !!! If only I could tell you how orgasmic it was!!!!! 
All the food was polished with amazing Burgundy and great service!


Thank you ! Thank you! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to our waiters (Hilary & Norman) for their suggestions and friendly/professional service. We definitely we come back here. 
I had the surf & turf and it was delisious."}
{"text":"Amazing steak had their food for the first time today unbelievable quality service outstanding
I would recommend the New York steak and corn hash"}
{"text":"I'm torned between a 3 and 4 star for this place. A 3 1/2 star would be most accurate for my experiences. Although my SO would probably rate it more like a 4 1/2 star. He was a little more into Aquaknox than I was. The hubby and I must have marinated on the bar stools for almost 2 hrs, one oyster after another... will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Is this place still open? I guess if I look like Crockett or Tubbs I would hit this place in south beach, in 1984. I thought this place reeked of cheese. Believe me I came in without any preconceived notion or opinion. What I left with was the feeling of being had. How can someone from the West coast feel this is decent seafood. The fish as well as the pairings really sucked. Ok, I had some Fanny Bay oysters that were fine to start, but as they evening progressed I felt that this was becoming a waste of money. Did I mention the aquablue bolagnie decore?"}
{"text":"Went here when I first got to the Venetian hotel/restaurant row. Peeps I was with wanted seafood so we picked this. Didn't have table available, which is not a big deal. Had to sit at high top in bar. But service was slow, wine list no bueno. And I ordered the steak and I would give it a 3 out of 10. No flavor and no sauce. Was over cooked also. The salmon that another person I was with looked pretty good. Soooo your choice"}
{"text":"A top seafood spot. Delicious stuffed lobster and great apps. There's a reason it won so many awards. The only drawback is the almost basement feel of the restaurant, on the lower walkway/casino level."}
{"text":"It was just a random choice since we were staying at the Palazzo already, but it turned out to be a fantastic experience at the Aquaknox.

The greeting staff was very polite and nice, brought us to our table and quickly got a high chair for our 1 year old.  We were initially skeptical about it because it's a \"quiet\" restaurant, but they were actually very welcoming and accommodated us just fine.

Our server Jesse came, and he's easily one of the best servers we have seen.  He's very nice, humorous, and most importantly clear in explaining the menu.  Another thing we love about him was that he always checked on us at the right time, not so often that it became annoying, but at the same time whenever we needed something, he was right there.

We ordered the smoked fish trio appetizer, it was very light and fresh.  It was a very fun dish and we enjoyed it a lot.  We also ordered a lobster bisque, and Jesse was great in splitting the soup for us.  We often find lobster bisque from other restaurants on the salty / strong side, but to our surprise Aquaknox got it perfect.  A lot of lobster flavor, silky smooth, and very very creamy.  We loved it.

Also worth it to mention about the bread sticks wit that smoky salmon butter.  It's so good and specially, very different from the breads that we have tasted in other restaurants.

My wife ordered the red snapper, it was very moist and light.  With all the vege on top, mashed potato at the bottom, and also the lightly citrus sauce, it was a great combination.

I ordered the crab meat stuffed lobster, and it's simply awesome.  The portion was no joke at all, the claws were bigger than my hand!!!!!!!  I have had a lot of lobster in my life, but these were done spot on.  It's very tender, but you still get the lobster texture.  My wife is not a big lobster lover but she was truly amazed at the few bites she tried.  It's very moist with that citrus and smoky flavor.  The stuffing was also heavenly.  Basically the whole dish was nothing short of WOW.

We also ordered a side dish of sauteed spinach, it's very fresh and also done very well.

The overall experience was a total A+, we were so surprised.  Of course, price is definitely on the high side, but for the quality of the food and also the kind of services we received, I think it was well worth the money.

And I am sure my 1 year old daughter would agree too.  She tasted every single dish that evening and she ate A LOT.  Yup, talk about one expensive dinner for a kid!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner this past Friday and it was superb. Wonderful service and the best scallops I've ever eaten in my life. It was absolute perfection. After our meal we were even given complimentary chocolate truffles and lemon shooters, which was a pleasant surprise. I couldn't have asked for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Hey, just because you are a seafood restaurant, you don't need to prove it by smelling like an Italian cooter on a hot summer day.

but f*ck, two for one Stella's kind rock, so 3 stars bitches.

oh, the menu looks retardly expensive, so we went to a sushi place to get the smell of fish out of our nose instead"}
{"text":"This is a late review but I came here in July with my family for my dad's bday. It's located between the Venetian and Palazzo where there are other restaurants and shops. Place was definitely not packed but ambiance was nice. We sat at a round table since we had 7 people. We started with appetizers - raw oysters, mussels, lobster bisque and king salmon tartare. For entr√©e, I had the sablefish \"butterfish.\" I actually didn't like it too much...I thought the corn puree was too heavy. I liked my mom's fish which was the barramundi. I definitely recommend it. Their scallops were good too. Overall, you can tell their seafood was fresh and everything was actually really good as well as the service. I was just a bit disappointed with my entr√©e. I would try something else the next time I go back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  Crab cakes, Seafood salad, lamb chops, dore and surf and turf, coffee.....even the complimentary dessert was great....We had tickets for the 9:30 Jersey Boys show so we were in a rush....they said they could take us, no problem....the only reason they don't have 5 stars is because we ended up stressing a bit of the food service....

Most of the experience as good, food excellent...next time we'll go when we don't have somewhere else to go...I think it would be a great place for a nice relaxing dinner....delicious!"}
{"text":"So, here's what happened...my wife and I were in Vegas for one night on our way to Zion National Park.  We intentionally booked at Caesar's so that we could eat at Mesa Grill, where I have had the best meals of my life. I called to make the reservation, and...Boom!...private party...not open.

Dagnabbit!

What to do? My wife loves seafood, so I Yelped seafood restaurants, and found great reviews for AquaKnox at the Venetian. Took a chance, and man, was it worth it! Simply the best service I have ever received at a Vegas upscale restaurant.

Our server (and assistant) constantly brought over little extras. For example, my wife had mentioned how good the corn and edamame succotash looked, but it didn't some with her entree.  Right after her main arrived, she was brought a dish of the succotash on the house. And it was incredible!

Here's the food breakdown:

We started with the Ahi tuna tartare. One of the best I've had. The Korean chili added the perfect amount of heat and the tiny pieces of crispy tempura and Asian pear brought great texture and a little crunch.

We followed with the lobster bisque. Um...drool...I mean...can't speak...still in catatonic stupor. 'Nuff said. We also had the butter lettuce and herb salad with champaign vinaigrette. Very fresh and balanced.

Mains: I had the scallops on corn puree and soft polenta. Seared perfectly, but the star of the plate was the mixture of the puree and polenta. And just for a neat little surprise, there were three pork cracklins in the center. Cleaned the plate and would have eaten more. My wife had the whole grilled sea bass. She loved it. It had a nice mesquite flavor and was perfectly cooked.

We ended with the banana cream pie with Guinness chocolate ice cream. The pie was unique and yummy. Not a traditional BCP. They layer ladyfingers throughout. What I liked most about it was that it wasn't overly sweet like a lot of BCP. The star of the dish, though, was the ice cream. When you paired a bite of pie with the ice cream, it was unreal. I could have eaten a whole pint.

As a nice closer, they brought over a delicious, cold digestif, with a small brownie.

I have found my second \"go to\" restaurant in Vegas. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Decent but not wonderful.  Portions were small for the price but the flavor and presentation was indeed excellent.  The seafood trio appetizer was delicious and the corn/lobster side was really flavorful."}
{"text":"Decided to do Las Vegas with no buffets and was happy with the restaurants we chose! Came here for a bday celebration and had a wonderful meal. Thanks to Opentable as my sister booked through them and we both had never heard of the restaurant before.

Service - considerate & attentive, but not smothering. There were a few people attending to the table and I didn't have any issues. We had everything we needed and there was constant follow-up throughout the meal.

Food -  a seafood lover's heaven! They even have caviar. Stand out entrees were the fish soup with large portions of shellfish and a spicy broth; and the cashew crusted tuna. I am used to the standard pepper ahi tuna, so this dish was a unique, crunchier version of one of my fav fishes. 
* Save room because the desserts are just as memorable. The bread pudding is a popular one, but for something lighter I would recommend the orange champagne semi-freddo. Delish! 

Atmosphere - sea of blues & whites. An immaculate setting. The restroom was also immaculate. 
* My only gripe was that some of the tables are a little close together.

Overall, Aquaknox was a great dining experience. They have an impressive wine list and so many seafood options that you just have to try something from the sea."}
{"text":"Yum!  It was on the picey side, but we had GREAT service.  The amuse bouce was quite amusing.  The little dessert mini bites were amazing.  There were some items that I would have tried, if we hadn't been headed out drinking.  Some of the sauces were a bit rich.  The specialty martini drinks were amazing.  The salad with fruit was good, but a bit heavy on the dressing.  The tuna tartare was AMAZING.  The decor was nice too.  This is a great place for a long, lingering dinner."}
{"text":"This place has amazing drinks. I was staying at the Venetian for a conference and would get drinks with some of the attendees at the end of the day. I got the Sangria cocktails regularly during my stay. The manager Craig Leedom is amazing. He has management skills written all over him. I have not seen a place run better than this on the strip. It's clean, great service and on point with quality menu items. I can see Craig Leedom running the entire casino in the next five to ten years. I forgot a folder and he had it sent to my house in California. This shows how much they appreciate there customers. Most restaurants or bars would say it's a lost cause sorry. We got thousands of tourists. I hope upper level management recognizes Craig for his management skills. If I had to open a restaurant or bar or any business. This is the guy I want watching or overseeing my business. I hope upper management recognizes him for his skills."}
{"text":"$$$$ it was a great experience worth the money. You feel like you're under the sea. The king crab legs hands down the freshest biggest and supposedly from the tv show the deadliest catch. Then we had the branzino and the Australiaian fish. Both were absolutely delicious. You won't regret coming here. Honestly our favorite spot here in vegas. If you're a seafood lover I highly recommend it. Our server was super super informative!! Like he had studied three hours before his shift!! Our busser was super funny knew how to earn that extra tip."}
{"text":"Wow! I will drive to Vegas just to eat there. Everything was awesome! Diner for 4 $560. Tip $140."}
{"text":"We had a company banquet here.  The place is nice and lounge type kind of restaurant.  The waiters and servers were nice and friendly.  They are only getting 3 stars because they took forever for our food to come out and the salmon was not cooked and the beef was so rare it was still moooooooooooing.  I noticed alot of pple did not finish their plate."}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week and has a great menu. Food was really good, service was good but the dessert took forever! Like 35 minutes forever. Mind you this was the dessert they had on the Resaurant week menu, so they had to know it was going to be ordered....right?"}
{"text":"Some of the best seafood we've ever had.  The lobster is done splendidly stuffed with crab, the scallops are the best we've ever had, and the surf and turf is incredible.  Great service as well.  The cocktails are hit or miss but the wine list is very good."}
{"text":"Best restaurant inside of The Venetian!!!

The Crab cake appetizer was a good choice for the table. 

The Lobster tail stuffed with Baked Crab was AMAZING! One of the best seafood dishes I have had. 

Dessert was outstanding - Flourless Chocolate Cake with Mint Ice Cream on Top and a \"shot glass\" full of hot caramel sauce. 

If you want to impress a date or have an excellent meal this is the place in The Venetian."}
{"text":"We didn't have any food here but had drinks here a couple of times.  The service was solid and the drinks were well done.  Worth checking out for a casual drink before dinner or on your way to a show."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was spot on. Nice atmosphere.

But two things that made for a bad taste in our mouths and tainted what should have been an excellent experience. My wife didn't want an appetizer, when we ordered there was some joking about me sharing my crab cake with her, waiter said he would bring an extra plate for her. Appetizer came out on two plates, two small crab cakes. Not sure if that is what I would have gotten  if I just said no to sharing. Anyway, bill came, charged an extra $4 for the privilege of sharing with my wife. What a rip-off. $22 for two bite sized crab cakes.

For dinner , I got the lobster with crab, when I was ordering I asked waiter if I got to choose the size or it just came as they had it. Was told I didn't get to choose the size, but it would be about 2 lbs. Lobster was maybe 1 1/4 tops. I get them from the market at home all the time, no way in hell that lobster was 2 lbs. $81 to boot, another rip-off.

Penny wise pound foolish strategy by this restaurant, meal was around $250, ripping us off for $4 and lying about the size of the lobster is not a good way to get people to come back and generates negative press for your restaurant. It taints the hotel also, would think twice about staying at the Venetian again now as I don't like being ripped off. Too many other hotel and restaurant choices in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had raw shellfish for lunch - the platter to be exact. I was disappointed in the staff knowledge of what was on the plate/remembering to bring the amenities, and what was on the plate was good but not great.  I'm not sure the food is up to the plan they have. Would be interested to try for dinner."}
{"text":"OMG....absolutely stunning!!!  Let me tell ya, I have been to my fair share of restaurants, and this place has moved to my top 2!!!  Service was great, drinks were great, and food was spectacular!!!  This was definitely a five star visit and I would recommend this place to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is just okay - way over priced. Service is okay, but drinks and food are very mediocre. You should definitely go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Inside Venetian.Best filet on my life! Cooked perfectly rare like i asked! Must go! Martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives! Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"One of the best meals of my entire life.  The food was outstanding and the service was impeccable.  Thank you for the experience!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Had the NY steak and it was good but nothing special.  With cut restaurant a 1 minute walk from here, if the plan is to get steak, I would go there."}
{"text":"Wow!  Don't criticize management too much in your review or they will have your review removed.  

Great seafood.  Atrocious service.  

Was 3 star review, but is now 1 star for censorship."}
{"text":"It was my last night in Vegas, so I wanted to take my girlfriend out to a nice dinner. We decided to stop here and it was definitely the right choice. We were greeted by very friendly hostesses which was a good sign. They were all very kind and although we were quite casually dressed, they invited us in anyway. Bonus points for them. 

The restaurant is quite classy with white linens, a very modern feel, darker lighting and a really cool wine cooler that's a focal point in the front of the restaurant.

We were shown to our table and we were greeted by our waiters. They worked in tandem, which was quite cool as we were never thirsty or left wanting for anything. They brought out a wonderful amuse bouche that was spread over bread sticks. Very nice beginning and more than a bite so that was nice.

We decided to go all out and really enjoy this meal, so we each got appetizers. I got the crab cakes ($18) that were marinated with vegetable relish, citrus aioli, and petite mache.  They are smaller, but there was not any filling as it was all crab. Very nice change from those giant crab cakes that are 50% filler. Worth every bite. 

My girlfriend got the Lobster Bisque ($15). It contained Maine lobster, caviar, and creme fraiche. Wow. It was flavorful, with the creme cutting the richness a bit, but not too much. I never had bisque with caviar and it did add a nice little touch. 

Next up, the main dishes which we sort of shared. The Georges Bank Scallops ($34) included black truffle creamed corn, with apple-wood smoked bacon polenta. The scallops were perfectly seared and cooked properly. I haven't had one like this in ages, and it really brought back memories from eating them as a kid. The polenta was pretty tasty as well, but I liked it more than she did. 

The Wild Barramundi ($35) included a tasty chive potato puree, baby tomatoes, and was topped with an asparagus-wild mushroom vinaigrette. I liked it a lot. I didn't know what to expect from the texture, which is a more on the oily side. It worked for me. It was quite moist and flavorful. The potato puree was amazing and went so well with the fish. 

We had no room left after the meal so we skipped dessert. All in all, I would really recommend this restaurant for the friendly service, kind hostesses, great atmosphere and of course the food. If you're in town, definitely consider this place for a great seafood meal."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary and I know we hit the restaurant at the beginning of a dual-convention week and I know how hard that can be, but geez... This was not the experience we expected.

For starters, one of our servers, while pleasant, was very obviously sick. She had almost no voice and was sucking on a mentholated cough drop every time she attempted to talk to our table. She was as pleasant as she could be but it was obvious she was really ill. Not really what you want around your food when people are literally dying of the flu. Management: I know you're slammed but LET YOUR SERVERS GO HOME SICK WHEN THEY'RE SICK. Seriously. The other server on the team was fine but pretty aloof.

I further complicated things by coming in with a trio of allergies: milk, egg, and soy. My husband called ahead to make sure they could accommodate us because we didn't want to make a stink and the servers were kind enough to make note of this (it was clearly marked in our reservation, which is great) at the beginning of the evening.

I ordered a martini. It took awhile and arrived in a broken glass. I asked for a replacement. We had tap water; my glass sat empty most of the night because there was no one around to refill it.

Onto the food... I was a little disappointed that the servers acknowledged the allergies but didn't offer any suggestions as to which menu items were \"safe\" and which weren't or what, if any, adjustments could be made. I don't like to be that person who asks a hundred questions and the servers made it clear they were in a hurry so I just picked a few things and asked specifically about those.

We started with the seafood sampler tower. Everything was delicious. The oysters were beautifully fresh and expertly cleaned, the shrimp were large and juicy, the the cocktail sauce well-made, etc. Next came a butter lettuce salad with champagne vinaigrette - the dressing was fantastic. A simple salad and totally overpriced (hey, it's the strip!) but executed well. 

For our entree, we shared a strip steak that came with mashed potatoes, charred shishito peppers and green onions, and a madeira sauce. We asked if we could switch out the mashed potatoes for their Kennebec french fries due to the dairy allergy and were told that was fine. There was more than a half an hour between the salad and steak courses. WAY too long. When the steak finally arrived, they had split it for us (nice) and given all of the sides to my husband and just the half steak, a pepper, and onion to me. We asked about the fries and the server said we never ordered them. I mean, we had an entire conversation... but okay.

The steak was good but not great. It was cooked unevenly and clearly sat on the cooker too long on one side and not enough on the other so it was part almost rare and part medium well. That's no way to treat a $57 steak. Flavor was good though which is a major plus since I didn't have any sauce. The shishito and green onion were smoky and full of yum.

My absolute favorite part of the meal was the surprise dessert they brought out for our anniversary. It was presented with great flourish to my husband, with the server saying \"The chef sent you a surprise! You get a miniature milkshake and a petite donut\" then he turned to me and said \"And I got you a strawberry.\" Epic. Thanks for the strawberry!

Look, I know allergies aren't easy to deal with and I don't expect the kitchen to pull something custom out just because I waltzed in but there was zero attempt to be helpful - that's fine in Denny's, I guess, but you expect more from a place with AquaKnox's reputation and price point. Beyond that, the service just wasn't up to par. There are a lot of places to eat in Vegas and although I had a great night with my husband, because he's awesome, we won't be back to AquaKnox. The sad part is, I don't think they care."}
{"text":"Aquaknox is an extraordinary restaurant. My recent dining experience for my birthday was absolutely divine. Every bite of delectable food from the appetizers to the dessert was polished off. Embarrassingly, not a crumb or smidgen of flavorful sauce left behind. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. The ambiance is perfect for many different types of ocassions, even to simply enjoy a special dinner alone. The staff and assistant manager were amazing-  very warm and accomodating. Do not miss the opportunity to experience this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch during a trade show.  I was in the mood for something different and happened upon Aquaknox.

I had the tuna over lentils.  Since the ahi was sushi grade they prepared it with just a bit of the seasonings over cooked lentils and a vinaigrette sauce.  AMAZING.  It was a little spendy for a quick bite, but totally worth it. 

The service was fantastic, the only thing I was disappointed about was them not having any desserts for the afternoon.  They only carry desserts for the evening and they are made that day.  Great for dinner patrons, not so good for those of us durning lunch."}
{"text":"The figs wrapped in goat cheese are amazing. The masala game hen was also very good. The atmosphere was really loud though, it looks like a nice place but is louder than a sports bar"}
{"text":"Each year at CES #LenovoCES holds it nigthly parties for customers and friends to enjoy and this places rocks the house for Lenovo the food is great and the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Very good food, but inconsistent presentation even for the same dishes ordered at the same table. 

Lead waiters lack finesse and sophistication that one would expect for this type of restaurant. 

Lead waiters apply heavy sell jobs and pressure points for the seafood plateau $80 app and the $90 surf and turf specials.  Do they know it isn't convention season yet. 

Nice wine list and overpriced. 

Cocktails good, but plan on a long wait in the lounge or at your table. 

100's of better choices within 1 mile with better food, better service and overall better value."}
{"text":"Ate here during a recent trip to Vegas and left very satisfied. The atmosphere is modern and sophisticated and our waiters were very attentive and friendly. 

We had the mussels and seafood trio for appetizers. Both were an excellent start to our amazing dinner. The mussels were served in a delicious garlicky broth along with bread. The seafood trio showcased lobster, crab, and shrimp cocktail. In addition to these appetizers we were provided with a complementary tuna tartar appetizer to \"wake up\" our palettes. 

For dinner we had the prawns and scallops. Both entrees were outstanding and the perfect amount of food. 

We skipped dessert but were given a complementary cake pop and virgin white russian.  It satisfied my sweet tooth perfectly. 

I don't often get to enjoy fine dining, but this restaurant was well worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !!! We came here for dinner and everything on menu looks amazing. I got the crab cake and it was beyond yummy!!! For sure coming here again soon."}
{"text":"Nothing compares. By far one of the BEST fine dining experiences in Las Vegas. The food and service are beyond comprehension.  Just phenomenal."}
{"text":"We are locals in LasVegas. We went to this restaurant for my wife's birthday. I was never so pleased with a restaurant as I was last night. The service was outstanding. The food was some of the best sea food we ever had in Las Vegas. It's not cheap but it was totally worth it. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves sea food, and expects great food and service."}
{"text":"The family and I dined at Aquaknox our second night in Vegas.  For those who have never been there, it is located in the Venetian.  First impression:  very soothing colors in shades of blue, green and cream.  They have a really cool little private dining room with seating for about 4 or 5 inside a round glass wine display.  Imagine dining with bottles and bottles of wine surrounding you.  ;)  They have a few pretty water displays too.  

The restaurant was not very busy, but to be honest, Vegas itself seemed pretty empty this trip.  The economy perhaps?  Anyway, our waiter and busboy were both very pleasant and helpful.  We had three coupons for complimentary Aquatinis...don't mind if we do!  It was a very pretty drink, but a little too sweet for my taste.  

I split the beet salad with my sister.  It was served with a rather sweet dressing.  Thank goodness for the blue cheese crumbles which did a great job balancing out the sweetness.  I found several entrees on the menu that sounded really good, but I chose the grouper.  It was rice crusted and served over green tea-infused soba noodles.  As separates, everything was very tasty, but together it was a rather odd combo of flavors.  If I went back I would probably order the scallops like my dad or the John Dory like my mom and sister.  

We all split a Lemon Crush dessert which was excellent.  It consisted of the most amazing lemon cake, a little round cookie on top of the cake and a scoop of ice cream.  The presentation of all of our dishes was very pleasing."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque was delicious
Lobster Salad was SUPERB
Crab cakes were AWESOME
Seabass was so buttery
Filet was wonderful
Tuna tartar was fresh
Service was excellent

Theres a private wine cellar room for private dining. Romantic and really cute spot.

Im def returning for the food!"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with my friend , everything that we ordered were so tasty! The seafood was very fresh, Oysters and scallops were so good! Love them! And service was nice too! It's a worthy place to go!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. I am only giving it 4 stars bc part of the dining experience is atmosphere and this place has a cheesy decor a la Miami in the early 90's. The place is in dire need of updating to the current decade. The staff is v friendly and knowledgable. Order sea bass, butterfish and the lobster special - excellent. The octopus carpaccio is unique and memorable- in a good way!"}
{"text":"Any place that cracks my lobster claws for me deserves 5 stars and a nice tip!!! 

This waiter was great!!! 

We started with 2 crab claws that did not provide very much meat. This was okay with us, because when the entrees were served it was clear we did not need an appetizer. 

I had lobster stuffed with crab! Yum!! It was cooked perfectly so there was not too much hassle to get the meat out. Then the waiter offered to crack my lobster claws and pulled out this scrumptious piece of meat that was heavenly! Oh my. 

My date had surf and turf which is huge. A full prime rib and a full lobster, I think it is meant for 2 people? Delicious none the less. 

Everything was great here."}
{"text":"I went to Aqua Knox for dinner with some colleagues on a Wednesday. We sat in one of the booths. The restaurant was half empty.
The food was tasty and well presented. Service was also what you would expect for the price. The surf and turf with grilled and crab-filled lobster was, according to my colleagues, worth a trip back to this restaurant. Portions were very large, but came with a pricy tag ($120 per person, with appetizers, main course, some shared desserts but NO wine)."}
{"text":"The Aquaknox plateau was a good mix of fresh seafood. I particularly enjoyed the raw oysters and clam. The shrimp and lobster were fresh but on the small side. The tatsoi and strawberry salad with balsamic reduction was delicious. Really impressed with how knowledgeable and attentive our server was. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant represents the epitome of service when it comes to fine dining. 

We went in for an anniversary/birthday dinner, and we weren't disappointed-- the staff was absolutely professional, and friendly. 

I had half of the Aquaknox Plateau, and the scallops; she had the tuna tartar and the John Dory.

All delicious, although I recommend the John Dory above all!  Delicious, simple, clean flavors. Can't recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"Okay this place is expensive. You know that walking in. That being said you get what you pay for. Picked AquaKnox as my last restaurant on a Monday night before I returned home after an adventurous weekend in Vegas. I only had the fish soup but it was amazing and a good size serving. It is saffron-based so if you don't do spicy, if you're weirded out by cuisines like Indian and Vietnamese, then don't order it. The soup included shrimp and fish, and lobster, although I hardly got any (my small lobster shell was mostly stuffed with couscous). It was a delightful soup that I'm still thinking about three days later. Our two waiters were great but unfortunately I don't remember their names. They worked as a team which is typical at a fancy restaurant. Make sure you tip them accordingly. I'm definitely returning next time I'm in town. The rest of the menu is probably amazing."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. My new favorite seafood place anywhere! Great staff and of course great food. Had appetizer, entree, and dessert. 
Atmosphere was very cozy too!"}
{"text":"Four of us were invited by the GM of AquaKnox to dine there last night.  The idea was the chef would send out dishes to highlight the things they're doing at AquaKnox with the new executive chef.  We gathered at 5:30 and then spent over three hours enjoying good company, good conversation, and great food!  

For starters, we got an amuse-bouche of scallop ceviche.  Very nice start with some chopped scallop on a tortilla chip.

Next out was a trio of oysters.  One was an oyster shooter in a great liquid with a kick from hot sauce.  The server recommended we drink it all at once or we'd end up getting too much hot sauce at once.  We all listened.  The spiciness lingered for awhile.  Another oyster was their Oyster Rockefeller with crumb top.  It was very tasty.  Finally, there was an oyster from the Northwest with some house made salsa fresca.  Very nice.

Next up was foie gras with a carrot confit on a Nutella infused toast round.  The ingredients went together so well.  This is not on their current menu.  Foie gras is available as a topping for steak.  They're thinking of adding it to the menu.

Then came the AquaKnox fish soup.  The menu describes it as having Mediterranean tomato-saffron broth, Maine lobster, John Dory, mussels, clams, prawns, Sardinian couscous.  There was Ono in the soup last night and the tomato-saffron broth was superb!  The soup had  a rich spiciness to it and was accompanied by two toast points.

The next course was pan roasted Ono on an artichoke sauce with persimmon and some fingerling potato halves.  The fish was moist, rich, and was just incredibly good.

Up next was their take on surf and turf.  There were two sides to the dish--one with shrimp on couscous.  On the other side was a scallop on a bed of mushrooms over squash pur√©e.  Perfectly cooked with an excellent blend of flavors, this was another outstanding dish.

The next course was a sampling of three of their steaks.  The steaks are wet aged.  The slices were from their filet, ribeye, and NY strip.  The filet and strip were like butter they were so tender.  The ribeye was a bit tougher.  The trio was served with shishito peppers, cooked onions, and mashed potatoes.

Then came the dessert course.  We were presented with a dish with three dessert samples--Banana cream pie served with a caramelized banana slice, banana cream, and Guinness ice cream.  Another was their take on the classic s'mores.  It had browned marshmallow on chocolate with a graham crust.  Finally, the butterscotch bread pudding with brioche soaked in homemade butterscotch caramel.  Absolutely delicious.  As we were starting these, we were brought a serving of key lime pie with two cherries in glass looking candy.  The presentation was stunning.

Not quite done yet, we were brought cinnamon cayenne cookies and shooter style glasses of hot chocolate.  The cinnamon flavor was similar to candy cinnamon which gave a zing to the cookies.  To end, two of us had double espressos over ice and two had hot green tea.

Service was exemplary.  For each course, four servers came together and rounded the table and then placed the dishes in unison.  Excluding me, the group did small wine pairings with each course.  The sommelier expertly explained his selections and described the wines.  My dining partners enjoyed their pairings and I enjoyed my iced tea which was replaced with a fresh one without the need to ask.

A perfectly wonderful meal and I'm pleased to maintain the 5 star level I gave AquaKnox when I first reviewed them during Restaurant Week earlier this year.  A very memorable and filling meal.  Hence my 15 mile bike ride this morning.  Thanks to all those at AquaKnox for making this a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Every times my husband and I in Vegas we staying at the Venetian Hotel, but we've never try any of the restaurants in this hotel.  This time we give it a try since we wanted something near and doesn't have to walk far.  So, I've booked this place for Valentine's night and it was excellently.  The place is clean and the foods are fresh.  I ordered the special of the day fish and it was great.  My husband got a steak and it very good.  The services are friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Aqua is in the Venetian Hotel. Call before you leave for vacation to make reservations. They are sometimes books days in advance, but if you forget give them a call and you may luck out.
The place itself is very pretty and quiet.
You will love the service. They know the menu so well and are there when you need them. 
Start with the Lobster Bisque. It is the best I have had. It is not watery like some. It is perfect.
If you like raw tuna you will love their tuna tartar. 
Skip the lobster, it is not that special and have some fresh fish. It is the best.
They have great salads including a seafood salad that is remarkable.
The wine list is very good and the pricing, high, but not outrageous.
You will love it.
Enjoy."}
{"text":"Equinox or Aquaknox? whatever, but i like the vibe of the place. 

i came here, didn't sit for food, since i was invited for a small cocktail party held by a friend. Greeted by nice people and waiters asked me many times if i need service. I was only a guest, but heck, there was service. 

I only stayed for 10 mins max, and service experience was really good. 

Hopefully i'll come back for something else, but 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"I've had many great meals in my life, but this evening at AquaKnox was easily in the top five.  Great food. Great drinks. Great service. Great atmosphere.  And most of all, great company!  Truly the bee's knees!"}
{"text":"Stars are for the service. Well done folks! Though, even the service wouldn't bring me back. The food, subpar for the EXTRAORDINARY (not in the good way) price. 

I had the shrimp. Husband had the crab stuffed lobster tail. The portions are good. At the very least, you won't leave hungry. I felt like if I had read that there was going to be cheese in the couscous, I would never have ordered it. I don't know whose bright idea it is/was to put cheese with seafood, but it is by far one of the most disgusting combinations in my book. Having said that, I didn't eat the couscous. Understand that all that's left is the shrimp. Which were HUGE, but also not mind blowing as far as texture and taste. Maybe it would taste better with cheese? Maybe not. 

I had a taste of the crab stuffed lobster tail and well. It's lobster. It's good. The crab stuffing though...salty with...too much. Like. Why waste crab if you can't taste it? Also, beware \"market price\". Just saying. It was 100% not worth it. Even if it was lobster.

The meal was wrapped up with a complimentary...dessert? Pallette cleanser? It was strawberry milk with a white chocolate and cranberry cookie. Didn't quite take the taste of the exorbitant price out of my mouth though. 

Try at your own risk."}
{"text":"The service was prompt and great and the decoration is modern and sleek. I love the little seating arrangement that they have inside the tubed tower of wine they display towards the front.  I ordered a scallop dish with risotto.  The risotto was delicious but the scallops were over seasoned.  

I also tried some mussels which were delicious and fresh.  They served it with a tiny baby bottle of Tabasco sauce that I thought was very cute."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. My wife had the Barramundi and it was probably the best fish dish she has ever had. Great flavors and crispy skin.  I had the Surf-n-Turf.  The crab stuffed lobster tail was flavorful.  The steak... it was cooked exactly as I had asked it to be. No complaints there... the flavor was lacking.  I have no issues paying top dollar for a steak/meal...I just expected more out of the plate I had.  We tried a few of the beers on the menu... the delirium tremens beer I enjoyed the most. 

All in all... a nice dinner out. We enjoyed ourselves and I would recommend giving the place a try if you haven't been."}
{"text":"AquaKnox was amazing. 
I ordered the surf and turf, and my filet was cooked perfectly, and served with a delicious reduction over a bed of mashed potatoes. The lobster was crab-stuffed, and the drawn butter was seasoned with something that made butter taste even better, if that is possible. To start we had a cheese plate, that was by far the best cheese plate I have ever had. The server brought us mini carrot cake bites at the end, courtesy of the chef. 
The service was really attentive and yeah, it was pricey, but I will never understand why people go to an expensive restaurant then complain about the price. If you are docking stars for the price people, I'm pretty sure there is a Panda Express around the corner. 
Loved loved AquaKnox, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great and the food left us still hungry. We shared the giant appetizer of seafood and the waiter told us it would be enough food but most of it was oysters and a few crab legs. Not worth the price. The ambience was probably the best thing about this restaurant. We shared a bottle of Failla wine which was wonderful and the pumpkin pie dessert was exceptional."}
{"text":"Was satisfied with the service, but the quality of the steak was not to my satisfaction. I asked for a rare steak, and received a medium well, my server did not respond fast enough to have the issue corrected. Would have enjoyed it more if my meal was cooked correctly."}
{"text":"Who knew this would be my last dinner in Vegas thus far, and that I would end up getting wheelchaired back to my Venetian suite?!

For starters, we were served a complimentary lobster-topped crostini.

A light appetizer consisting of freshly chopped watermelon cubes topped with halloumi set the stage for the best yet to come.

Dropped by for dinner when the hostesses mentioned a Halibut special: fresh halibut on top of lobster mash. The menu is not extensive, so it may not cater to some (or many) taste buds, but I'll be damned if that wasn't the most well-prepared halibut I've ever had. The dishes look simple, but I truly appreciate every bite, a subtle flavor that lingers on your palate the rest of the night. The complimentary white chocolates are icing on the cake.

Do not come here hungry - you will not be stuffed. Come here when you want your taste buds satiated with an interesting take on seafood."}
{"text":"Thomas our server was impeccable. He is the reason I'd return. The food was really good. I'd say the sea bass was a little bland but the crabcake was one of the best ice ever had."}
{"text":"This is a little overdue as My wife and I celebrated our Anniversary again at AquaKnox and we had our traditional COLD WATER OYSTERS, LOBSTER BISQUE, and the CRAB STUFFED MAINE LOBSTER, and out new favorite the BUTTERSCOTCH BREAD PUDDING.  As always the food is beyond enjoyable, it is always the highlight of our Anniversary in December. 

Min and the rest of the staff are AWESOME; Min always takes care of us and makes us special every year and makes our experience memorable every time.

Thank you again guys for a memorable night, my wife and I love your guys, the place is the Best in Las Vegas.

We are looking forward to December again at Aquaknox!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best. Seafood. Restaurant. EVER!

I really enjoyed my dining experience at AquaKnox.  I have actually wanted to try AquaKnox for years, but it took me 10 years to get over here.  What is wrong with me?! I've been missing out on this fabulous place for an entire decade.  Well, I finally remedied that problem and I am so glad I did.  My last dinner at AquaKnox ranks in my Top 10 dinners of my life!  

List of reasons to dine at AquaKnox:

1. Oh my goodness, this food is outstandingly brilliant.  We had a 7 course chef's tasting and my mind was blown after each dish.  I am not really an adventurous seafood eater, but I was at AquaKnox, so I went for it!  Every dish was so gorgeous that I had to try it immediately.  I tried so many new proteins, some of which I have never liked before, and loved every single bite!  

Every single dish was marvelous, but there were a few standouts.  My absolute favorite course was the duo plate of the Alaskan King Crab Cake and Lobster Bisque.  The Alaskan King Crab Cake was the best crab cake I have ever eaten.  I'm not even sure how the cakes hold together because it is mostly giant hunks of crab!  It is also served with a tasty apple slaw.  It was then paired with a delightful cup of Lobster Bisque that is served with a crostini topped with creme fraiche and caviar. Delish!  This soup had so many layers of flavor and was just enchanting to my senses.  This is definitely a most order dish!

My favorite entree was the Sablefish \"Butterfish.\" This was my first time having this fish and it blew my mind.  It was served with a miso glaze on top of a corn puree with breaded eggplant on the side.  I found this to be so complex and interesting.  The fish itself was fantastic with the miso glaze.  The eggplant and corn added extra levels of flavor that were surprising, but really worked well together.

The most adventurous course was the Warm Octopus Carpaccio.  I'm not usually an octopus fan, but I really enjoyed it this time.  The citrus vinaigrette really complimented and bought out some great flavors.  Go figure, I do like octopus!

Of course no meal at a seafood resturant is complete without the classic Surf & Turf dish.  AquaKnox knocked this out of the park.  We had the Filet with a Brazilian Lobster Tail.  It is a classic, but was as fantastic! 

2. The customer service is top notch!  From the moment to get to the restaurant, you are pampered.  The service here is just amazing.  The servers are so friendly and helpful. They help you along the way to make sure you get exactly what you need and want.  They check on you regularly and you never have to ask for anything because they are a step ahead the entire meal.  I was lucky enough to have the service team of Jesse and Tonya.  If you are going to AquaKnox, I highly recommend you request their section.  You will not regret it!

3. The sommelier, Louis, and the wine! During our menu tasting, we also opted for the sommelier's choice wine pairing.  I know absolutely nothing about wine except that it is made out of grapes.  I am zero help with picking wine, so I was ecstatic to have such a brilliant sommelier to help us with some wonderful wines for each course.  I also really liked how Louis gave us so much information about the types of grapes used, as well as the region where the wine is produced.  Educational and delicious, how fun!  I wish I could remember them all so I could go buy some for myself.  

4. The desserts! We had 2 desserts.  We had a flourless chocolate cake, which was good. The coup de gr√¢ce was the butterscotch bread pudding.  Wow, wow, wow this dessert was spectacular! It was a thing of beauty, flavor explosion, and just all around yummy.  Just order it and bathe in it's beauty!

5. The restaurant is beautiful! The seats are comfortable, the color scheme is visually appealing, and it is just a pleasant place to be in.  It is really just a lovely place to go for a nice dinner.

It doesn't matter if you are a local or a tourist, you need to go experience this magnificent restaurant.  I promise you will love every moment as much as I did.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Oysters were very fresh and tasty, lobster bisque was delicious as well with big chunks of lobster and creamy texture.  Seafood sampler was delicious as well. Yum yum yum"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Rating this based on the food and food alone.  Not the bar nor the wine.

I've decided to stop being a silent lurker and start contributing to Yelp! :)

I'm going to start with Aquaknox, a little gem that I've been going to since its opening week.  I remember during its first few years there was never a need to make a reservation.  It pleases me to see that how its steadily grown.

A quick note about the decor - it's date-worthy in a more less-romantic more-chic type of way.  I like when the lights changes color and getting a table with a good view of the wine cellar is always a plus.

So, don't let the entire seafood look and feel fool you.  What's really good here is the ribeye.  Several years ago one waiter proudly boasted to us that they have \"the best Ribeye in Vegas\".  Now, I think Vegas has many fairly good steak houses.  SW, Prime, Fix, Boa, and now Cut comes to mind, but this guy was not exaggerating.  It is really really good even when you compare it to upper echelon steakhouses' ribeye.  From some of the reviews I read - it makes me shiver thinking they may not have that ribeye anymore.  I don't know - I was at Vegas two weekends ago and also a month and a half ago, but I didn't have the opportunity to stop by.  I'll be there for Christmas and maybe once in between - I'll definitely check it out once during those two visits.

Assuming it's still there - if you're looking to get a great ribeye that somewhere else would easily charge you much more for the same quality - this is a great place.  You can also get the ribeye with the surf and turf special, which lets you pick between either a crab-stuffed lobster tail or just a regular 'ol lobster tail.  Both are good, I prefer the non-stuffed lobster tail.  Nothing spectacular as far as lobster goes, but completes the meal just fine.  Beware though, from my experience getting the surf and turf \"special\" is identical as ordering both the lobster tail and the ribeye together.  As in, the price is just the two dishes put together.  Maybe save a buck.

Another awesome dish here is the scallops.  I don't remember if it's an entree or an appetizer, but if it's an entree, we order it and request it to be served like an appetizer.  It's large, tender, flavorful, and depending on the seasonal preparation it will have a nice matching secondary taste.

Crab cakes were pretty decent too.  Nothing too \"wow wow wow\" but serves as a good alternative appetizer when in a large party.

Overall, I've never had a bad experience dining at Aquaknox and I'm pretty sure I've been there at least 15-20 times over the years.  It's certainly one of the two restaurants I've frequented the most often @ Las Vegas and will continue to attract me until they somehow mysteriously decline (ala Postrio).

Here's to hoping it stays great. :)"}
{"text":"The food was very good but the service was not good for the level and the price of the food and location of the restaurant. Atmosphere is not that warm and inviting."}
{"text":"I dined here last night. Service was excellent as usual my Fishermens stew was great. My mothers king crab legs were ordered to be steamed but when they arrived they were still cold. She went ahead and ate them and only informed me of the problem after she finished. I am very sorry to see their amuse Bouche of salmon mousse is no longer offered. It was spectacular."}
{"text":"Food is always great.  Whether you want a steak, seafood, or in between.  Great atmosphere...BEST ever Blue Martini cocktail.  Their best server no longer works there.  \"Jamil\" if you're out there...contact us at NC.  Been a few years and just wanted to give a shout out.  Hope you still have our ghetto blue shirts."}
{"text":"Came here tonight while at CES 2017. After exploring all of the top restaurants I have to say that Aquaknox was not only exceptional food but exceptional service. Sure to come back for more. Definitely recommend this to anyone with a fine palette ."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been motivated by an experience to write a review. Pretty good food, overpriced for the quality and quantity. Service was the worst I have ever had. Group of 8. In an empty restaurant (should have been a clue) treated like an annoyance once we declined the waiter's suggestion $200 bottle of wine. Waiter made subtle comments about us splitting salads, and how normally people order full salads with dinner which is why our dinner was so delayed.  Once our waiter realized that we weren't going to have a $1,000 bill, it was the last we saw of him.  Just a few visits from the assistant waiter to refill water.  

Upon leaving we were visited by our waiter one last time to get a small tray of sweets on the house since \"none of you bothered to order dessert\".  Very nice of him to say.  

Anyway it was by far the worst experience I have had in a restaurant in Vegas.  I am there frequently for business and have eaten at many restaurants on and off the strip.  This was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.  Jonah crab claws were delicious, Barramundi was A+ as was the seafood stew.  Jesse and Tanya were friendly and attentive servers and made this a special dinner for us.  This is an expensive restaurant, so be prepared!"}
{"text":"Decent seafood restaurant but would not return.  Just didn't have enough great dishes to warrant a return

Sweet shrimp and lobster salad:  fresh salad with greens loaded with protein and lightly dressed.  I could have had three times the portion!

Lobster bisque:  flavorful but rich and creamy, so if you're not a fan of heavy soups, this isn't for you

Crab cocktail:  large chunks of fleshy crab served with mustard sauce was a surprising favorite for us.   They do not skimp on the crab and it is excellent quality.

Crab cake:  typical.  Bready and fried patty

John Dory Main dish:  fish should have been more seasoned to impart flavor, but the black eyed bean sauce was tasty.  $45 was steep for this dish.

Peruvian sea bass main dish :  also lacked seasoning.  I think they try to emphasize the natural flavors of the fish but it turns out being bland and flat

Creme br√ªl√©e :  good but not a standout

Banana cream pie:  not a pie at all, more like banana cake layer with banana cream on top, then Carmelized bananas.   If you like bananas, you will enjoy this"}
{"text":"What we ate:
Lobster Bisque
Seafood Apetizer
Wild Halibut
Seared Ahi Tuna
Whole Fish
Surf 'n' Turf (blue crab stuffed lobster and filet mignon)
3 bottles of wine

So the food here is pretty good, expect to spend a good 2hrs eating because its one of those fancy ambiance restaurants. 

Well because of the obvious name we had to order seafood. The seafood appetizer was pretty good. Filled with 4 different clams, oyster shooters, ceviche, jumbo shrimp cocktails, crab claws, lobster....Um you could probably stop here b/c by the end of this I was pretty stuffed. We then had lobster bisque which was SOOOO FRIGGING good. Decadently creamy (mmmmm BUTTTER, FAT, LARD, whatever it was so rich) So tasty with small chunks of lobsters - FAVORITE!

I only tried two of the dishes ordered: Surf 'n' Turf and Wild Halibut. The halibut was good but not out of this world. At this point I was really stuffed so stomach realestate was becoming scarce and more selective. The surf 'n' turf was too salty (crab stuffed lobster) the filet was good but not the best I'd ever had.

Overall, come eat the seafood appetizer and lobster bisque drink some wine...you'll be stuffed. You can skip the entrees."}
{"text":"Let it be known that I only went to the bar (its nice looking, the water theme is cool, chill atmosphere too) at this place with a friend, who ordered a round then we left, so I know nothing about the food or service. What I do know is that when I saw my friend's tab for the two drinks he bought, I told him that I hope he also gets a squeezer or a small home to accompany the drinks or else he is getting royally screwed. Needless to say, he has no condo and no women accosted him as we sipped our small fortunes, so the royal screwing did indeed occur. While I expected the drinks to be expensive at this place, there is no need for a bar to ever approach the $20 per drink ceiling, because once that ceiling is hit all of mankind will be doomed to sobriety until a comet does us in like one did the dinosaurs. Yikes."}
{"text":"Omigoodness. If you like seafood you HAVE to eat here when in Vegas. The fish is done sooo perfectly. AND there isn't much attitude like you can find at other restaurants in The Venetian (Ahem, Bouchon).

My dinner at Aquaknox was one of the most delicious meals I have ever eaten. We started with the House Smoked Fish Plate (absolutely sublime) and the Seafood Trio appetizers (sweet shrimp, lobster and jumbo crab cocktails all with their own special sauces - YUM!!). Frickin amazing. Both of them. 

We moved on to the beet salad with horseradish vinaigrette and then I ordered the mesquite grilled Wild King Salmon and she ordered the sauteed John Dory with Lobster Succotash and Sweet Corn Broth. The salmon and the john dory were both cooked perfectly - medium rare, the sauces wonderful. As often happens, I liked her dish even better than mine! 

We ordered two desserts and only liked one of them, but that's because my friend doesn't like mousse and i don't like that kind of rich semisweet chocolate enough to have really  enjoyed the dessert. But the peach crumble dessert was awesome! 

The only reason why I am giving them 4 stars and not 5 is because the waiter seemed to have a great deal of trouble getting us a dry white wine to go with our meal. We tried one tasting at his suggestion and it was way too fruity and so we opted for another one he suggested, a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, which (1) took too long to get to our table (there was some problem, and we had already gone through 1/2 our appetizers by the time it showed up at our table) and (2) was NOT DRY! it wasn't overly sweet but it certainly was not dry as we had asked. 

But by the 2nd glass it didn't matter and the frickin food was sooo goshdarn delicious that I still walked away happy as, well, a clam."}
{"text":"We wanted to have a drink before our show and happened to come across AquaKnox. What a great suprise! Our bartender Mateo asked what we usually like to drink and took it from there. My husband discovered a new variety of Johnny Walker that he'd never tried. I enjoyed a blueberry infused vodka martini.
We enjoyed ourselves so much, we decided to come back to AquaKnox after the show. We enjoyed more unique cocktails paired with some great dishes to eat.
The next time you're in Vegas, you gotta go here. Be sure to ask for Mateo to prepare some amazing drinks!"}
{"text":"My wife had made reservation at Aquaknox on Valentine's and celebrate my 49th birthday which she had mentioned it on Open Table.. She choosen this restaurant because was highly recommended by her boss. We have been dining in so many fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas. We had to say this was the worse experience ever. Our reservation was at 8 15 pm. We received a call to confirm our reservation and she had mentioned that we'll be celebrating my b-
day and look forward to have us. So we showed up and got sat at the worse 
table in front of wine vault. The staff kept going in and out. The door was hitting my wife chair few times. Finally the front server Chris came to our table had mentioned that the servers who I had requested upon my reservation Tanya, Jesse or Mark were not available. So we had ordered some wine and bottled water then we ordered our meal. Finally we got our appetizer octopus with spicy sauce and lobster bisque. Food was dropped at the table with no explanations of the dish. I guess we have high expectation cause most fine dining restaurants that's what they do. The severs never checked back to see how was the appetizers till we were done. The water glasses were empty. Front server had no clue that we were drinking bottled water. Couldn't find our water so had to open another one. I get it if the restaurant was busy but it's not. There was no bread at the table. We didn't know that we have to ask for it. Finally we got our main course which is pretty good. Again servers never explain the dishes nor checked back till the end of the meal. We have heard the chocolate souffle was awesome so we told our server that we wanted one of those do we need to order ahead of time. He said no because it was not the traditional one. Then I said OK we'll try it. This conversation was take place when we ordered our meal. Well after we finished our main course getting ready to order desert, I had told our server that you guys were out of chocolate souffle because I heard one of your staff had told one of the server who were right behind me 15 minutes ago. Our server had no clue, he went in the kitchen to find out and it was true that they were out. So we ordered creme brulee. Took them quite sometime to bring it out. I don't know that your restaurant doesn't do b-day for your guests but at least say happy birthday. Nothing not a word. On top of that our server put our leftover in paper bag and didn't close the top really good so on the way back to our car the bag was soaking wet from the sauce and dripping all over myself. Normally we don't complaint if there is few little things but this was BAD from the beginning till the end. Especially if your staff kept saying welcome back cause we had asked for specific servers, they should be on top of the game. We spent this kind of money, we expect to have some kind of service."}
{"text":"We dined here for our anniversary and had a wonderful experience. The food was great. I had the lobster which took me a really long time to eat! 
The service was excellent and non-intrusive.
Although expensive, it was really worth every penny."}
{"text":"So maybe the food is good, but hello if you're gonna be a place to have a full bar and lounge places to sit, don't close before midnight on a weekend. And don't take my candle just so you can close early. I definitely won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here for my birthday in January. I chose this restaurant based on a coworker's recommendation and now I know where to go for restaurant recommendations!

We made a reservation and when asked if we were celebrating we noted that it was my birthday. The hostess was very welcoming and seated us in a cozy, romantic booth. The restaurant was nicely decorated and swanky.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful with the menu options. I loved the amuse-bouche to start. It was a beef wellington that should be added to the menu because I could definitely go for more of that. The meals were a true example of what happens when a trained chef knows how to combine flavors for an amazing meal. I had the scallops that were tender and bursting with the flavors on the plate. The butternut squash and brussels sprouts perfectly paired with the scallops. My husband had the salmon with forbidden rice. His dish was also the perfect combination of flavors and possibly even better than my dish. For dessert I had the butterscotch bread pudding. I love butterscotch and rarely find this as a dessert offering. I realized half-way through that I was shaking my head \"yes\" with each bite. So moist and full of butterscotch flavor. I can't wait to come back here and enjoy another top notch meal."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere...  Be prepared to spend some money."}
{"text":"PROS: ?
CONS: Everything - high prices, mediocre flavors at best, bad service

For being a higher-end, \"fancy\" restaurant, AquaKnox was incredibly disappointing. The appetizers and seafood entrees were mediocre at best, and definitely not worth the prices on the menu. The seasonings on all of the dishes were either incredibly bland, reminiscent of bad diner food, or clashingly distasteful. 

The wait staff, though seemingly professional, was quite rude. They swiftly removed plates from the guests without waiting for people to finish, and made us feel rushed, almost as if they wanted us out the door. I cannot fathom some of the glowing reviews. Sure, the food and restaurant may look pretty, but it's about the entire package. The restaurant had a sign outside showcasing all the awards they have received in the past... but all of them were awarded more than 2 years ago. Definitely would not return."}
{"text":"This place is really good... had the steak and lobster tail and it was bomb.  Ive had better and for a better price which is why i give it 4 stars  but def would come back again."}
{"text":"Filet was cooked perfectly but nothing special. Lobster bisque was overly salty and crab cake texture was poor. The crab cake was disappointing from a taste perspective. While Service was kind, it took a while to get the order to the table. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"The pok√´ was decent   the place was overly crowded .  For the most part all o the sea food was served over the top, in some decadent manner this ruining the simple clean flavor of what sea food should be like.  The ceviche was horrible, tasted like steamed prawns in a strong vinegar pickle juice.  The Caesar salad, Was at best average with a decent black garlic sauce.  The steamed spinach, was just steamed spinach .  The Pinot Noir  that was ordered tasted like a cheap $7 bottle from trader Joes.  The sad part was the best part of the meal was the smoked salmon muse that was brought to the table when we first sat down.  For all this sup-par food, the prices that were paid were twice more than going to a Ruth Chris .  Save your money and your money and expectations for a different restaurant."}
{"text":"I actually texted my sister right after the meal, raving that my dinner at Aquaknox was one of the best I've had in a while.  Well, that's what delirium does to you...your judgment gets all clouded.  This was my first meal during my long weekend in Vegas, and I was absolutely starving after a day of sun-worshipping.  We got to the restaurant around 10-ish Thursday night, and the place was pretty empty.  Yet, they still made us wait like 25 minutes at the bar.  Finally, once we were ravenous AND tipsy, they decided to seat us at one of the booths.  Very pretty decor, btw.  Aquaknox, you may have deceived my tipsy self into thinking I had a great meal here with your fancy decor and super-nice and attentive staff during that night (come to think of it, is there a restaurant in Vegas that DOESN\"T have super-nice and attentive staff?)  However, I have been schooled in the ways of Vegas dining since, and I am no longer impressed.  
For my entree, I ordered the Seared Main Scallops with mushrooms, spaghetti squash, and some Asian-looking green vegetable in a cream sauce.  After finishing off the scallops and mushrooms, I poked at the rest of my entree.  Now, I like veggies, but the way they prepared it was a bit...underwhelming.  I also tried the Seared Ahi Tuna, which was cooked perfectly.  However, I nearly choked on the excess pepper that was on that tuna.  Dessert was phyllo with walnut ice cream in a caramel sauce.  Pretty presentation, but taste was nothing special.  You're basically paying for the ambience and service here (minus the long wait).  One last thing...do NOT try the Ginger Beer....blech.

Overall impression:  overpriced, mediocre drinks, and overly seasoned food (what are they trying to hide?)  I'd really give the place two and a half stars, but they were really nice when my also-drunk friend knocked over a glass and broke it while trying to get up, hence the three stars.  Would I come back, though?  Probably not."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!  I went with a few friends for my meetup and highly recommend it.  The decor, the service and atmosphere is outstanding.  I can't wait to go back for date night with my husband."}
{"text":"This gem inside The Venetian is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in Vegas or anywhere else.  The room is beautiful with comfortable chairs and elegant booths, and the noise level is thankfully minimal.

Be warned of the prices, though.  The night we went the 2 lb. stuffed lobster was $96.00!  

I started with a clever appetizer of three seafood cocktails - crab, shrimp ceviche, and lobster.  Surprisingly filling and delicious, although I cared less for the crab.  One friend had to leave early to catch a show.  He had the lobster for his entr√©e and, though not worth $96.00, it was a beauty.  We were not as hungry as we thought so we split an order of foie gras, which was nothing short of orgasmic.  Perfectly seared and simply served with some frisee, I wanted more. So good that I pity the poor bastard who has never savored the unique culinary delight that a goose so generously gave its life for.

We also split a lobster tail, which was superb, served with drawn butter, grilled lemon, and two tasty spears of asparagus for each of us.  These small plates were perfect.

Our amazing servers, Jesse and Tonya, made the whole experience just that - an experience.  Turns out these cute kids are married, and they made us feel like we had been coming there for years.  I raved about them and the food, so Jesse summoned the chef to our table, a delightful young man by the name of Deric Meininger, a Michigan native who has found his true calling Vegas.  Anyway, I told him I am a very fussy New Yorker, and could not find a single flaw with the food or service.

This is my new mandatory go-to place in Vegas.  Jesse and Tonya work Monday - Friday.  Tell them the fussy New Yorker sent you.  You'll have a great time!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.

The reviews on yelp, and professional, they pitched this place like the end all to seafood.

Seated immediately, and I'll admit the staff has a pleasant demeanor about them, the food is just kind of meh.

Ordered Ora salmon, it came out very dried out. The Tuscany potatoes tasted like salt and blue cheese as well. We even had to ask for ice in our water more than once.

The men's bathroom was wet all aver the floor (see picture)

I'm fine with paying 100+ for dinner while on vacation, but I do have some minimal expectations. This did not meet them. If the wait/host staff hadn't had such a charming attitude, I'd have rated it a 1."}
{"text":"The dining room here is huge. Coupled with the high ceilings and modern decor, it almost loses the intimacy of a fancy restaurant.  But, with the friendly service and comfy chairs, it all balances well.

Located in Venetian's restaurant row, AquaKonx is one of many choices. It distinguishes itself with a smart, concise menu, fresh seafood, and options for all diners.

They do have a Coconut Tofu curry dish for the vegetarian, which looked intriguing enough to almost order, but we opted for Oysters, John Dory, Crab-Stuffed Lobster, and a Filet.

The oysters are by the 1/2 dozen, and we received 2 different Pairs of New York varietals along with a pair from Prince Edwards. Very fresh, and a good mix of salinity and sweetness. 

The serving team progressed the meal with an Amuse Bouche of Albacore poke.

John Dory was served with a Corn Succotash, and was pan fried with a hint of heat. The Lobster was well cooked, stuffed with blue crab and stuffing mix. The claw was de-shelled and placed on the open body. The filet was about seven ounces and cooked to rare. Typical red wine reduction, but perfectly executed.

The dessert was an event in itself. The Butterscotch bread pudding was the best bread pudding I have had. Not terribly sweet, well balanced and huge portion.

The meal ended with a small chocolate cookie and gingerbread latte courtesy of the restaurant. 

Overall, great pacing and food. Definetly will re-visit next trip."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous eating here because when we go there it was empty. It turned out good and I would recommend eating there. I had the scallops and enjoyed it. Their lobster bisque soup was great!"}
{"text":"This ranks up there as one of the finest meals and service I have had in a while. The food was absolutely amazing and the entire evening was paced perfectly. The sommelier recommended the perfect wine for me, and the team of Carlos and Angela really were terrific. Their lobster bisque is hands-down exquisite and possibly some of the best in the world. My husband and I followed that up with the tasting trio of king crab, Florida shrimp ceviche and Maine Lobster cocktail. My husban' told me  his filet mignon was probably the best one he has ever eaten, and I splurged and went with the stuffed grilled Maine Lobster which was beautifully presented and stuffed not with fillers but with Maryland lump crab. We were celebrating our anniversary, and the staff went out of their way not only to make us feel very at home but made sure that our meals were absolute perfection. Well done."}
{"text":"This is this perfect place to dine if you love Lobster. Crab cakes are very tasty. The blue lighting is calming. The service is impeccable along with everything else.. great place to take someone for a romantic dinner :o)"}
{"text":"The seafood here was really fresh. We had a boothe and the service was really well done.

The surf and turf was exceptional except that I couldn't finish it as it was too much food. I'd tell you what I had for dessert, but I don't remember due to the excessive amounts of wine and port consumed.

This place isnt cheap though!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give it 4 stars is for the portion size. We ordered the crab cake and the filet mignon and the NY strip. All of the food was delicious and the steaks were large but the sides were lacking. They are very pricey so I would expect more for my money. They were very attentive and the service was top-notch."}
{"text":"Finally a Las Vegas restaurant that give you what you pay for. This place is really not THAT expensive considering the pricey options in Vegas but the truth is you really get alot of food for your money at this place. I started with steamed clams that weren't huge but they were soo good. The sauce they were served in was delicious! I also had a whole lobster which was stuffed with crab stuffing. The lobster must've been at least 2 lbs. It was cooked perfect and buttery and delicious. I made a huge mess and I like the type of fancy restaurant that doesn't make you afraid to get into your food. The wait staff was excellent. I must've had 4 waitors all stumling over eachother to get us what we needed. The dessert was good too. I think we had creme brulee but can't remember. They also gave us hot towels and things to clean up after we got all lobstery. This place was great. I can't even complain about the price which is usually my favorite thing to do.

The atmosphere was soothing and romantic with blue and white everything. They had really nice looking booths that I would like to sit in next time I'm there. Really well decorated, fashionable, and super delicious. This place hit the nail on the head for sure."}
{"text":"I took my family here for a farewell dinner on 6/24.  Prior to going, I was looking for a restaurant that would have a special private dining option available.  Valerie (private events from Aquaknox) contacted me right away and sold me on what Aquaknox had to offer.  I wanted to make this special for my bro-in-law who was being deployed.  Valerie was able to offer a special military discount of 15% off our total bill (awesome gesture) and recommended the wine tower to have our dinner.  She gave us multiple options for the tasting menu and I opted for the 5 course.  I read many reviews and was a little concern that it may be too little of food (4 dishes plus dessert), but boy was I wrong. Prior to our arrival date, Valerie kept in constant contact with me to go over the menu, menu design, and to just ensure that our dinner was going to be special.  This level of service continued on to the day of our event.
We arrived and was promptly escorted into the wine tower.  Since it was a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was not crowded, but I am still glad we decided on the Wine tower.  It made all feel special.  The tower itself is a tad chilly (but she had already warned me of that) but we were prepared.  There were people constantly serving us. Andrea was our captain for the evening, and was on top of everything and super friendly.  We started off we a toast (she recommended a sparkling wine over champagne to save us cost).  We had two non drinkers, so Min (assistant manager/mixologist) made them a really special drink (consisting of ginger beer and some other fruits).  They really really enjoyed it.  
The menu was printed on a card and got everyone excited.  We started off with oysters.  Great presentation and most importantly, great flavor.  Only small knock was that Andrea wasn't exactly sure which oysters were which (no big deal).  The first official course was a gazpacho.  This was the best that I have every had.  Very fresh and tasty.  The following 3 courses were duos of amazing stuff.  Crab cakes and Shrimp Salad.  The crab cakes were flavor full, but the shrimp salad was were it was at.  It consisted of 2 sweet shrimps, and a ton of lump crab meat.  This was topped off with micro greens.  Very very delicious.  Next was the fishes.  Barramundi/John Dory.  I was excited to try the John Dory.  But what made the dish was the lobster succotash below it.  Very nice dish.  The Barramundi was also very good with the mash potatoes.  We could have ended it there, but then came the surf and turf.  Filet was on point.  Perfectly cooked and nice flavor.  The prawns (2) were cooked on open flames and also had great flavor.  By now, we were totally stuffed and could barely consumed dessert (chocolate gelato/mousse combo).  Also throughout the evening, we kept asking Min to make us different cocktails.  He took pleasure in coming up with different things and explaining what he made.  I really appreciate all of his explanation and effort he put into it.  One of the girls asked about the ginger beer, he produced a new bottle and served us each a sample.  
All in all, service and food was spot on.  Aquaknox may not be the most famous restaurant in Vegas (or even in the Venetian), yet it should definitely not be overlooked.  I thought we got a great value (5 course turned into 9 courses) in the tasting menu.  Nothing was over the top but very tasty.  Flavors were not too complex for our simple palates.
Will definitely return.  Thanks Valerie, Min, Andrea, and the rest of the staff for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"WARNING: Beware of the servers. Check your bill before paying!!!

The only reason this restaurant got a one star from me is because the food was pretty good.  Not exceptional, was still decent.  HORRIBLE service...my boyfriend and I kept thinking that we were getting punk'd because the staff kept doing too many things just outright weird.....like we asked for bread, we were told that the \"Chef is stingy with bread\", but we can opt for breadsticks! yippie!!!! Ok, fine. We order the breadsticks, and they never show up with them. Our food took forever, we had to leave our table to get the waiter to us, had to pour our own wine and the list goes on.
But the most disappointing aspect of this whole experience.......how they are like used car salesmen, tapping in an extra charge here and there, \"accidentally\" double charging for appetizers AND suggesting splitting a dish and charging full price plus a splitting charge.  I think the restaurant is sinking in the sea of fine establishments in las vegas and is desperate to keep their margin high.  NEVER will we go here again, crappy service overpowers delicious crabcakes."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last tuesday for our anniversary. From the beginning checking in with the hostess they were so polite. Luckily wasn't a super busy night and they sat us at a very intimate and comfortable table. 
The menu was absolutely delectable, almost hard to decide because everythinf sounded so wonderful. 
The first thing asked was about allergies, which we both have food allergies, the idea os someone asking to help out with the menu made me feel so safe in their hands. 
I am personally a server and bartender, and cannot tell you how much we appreciated the wonder team who were our servers Mr. And Mrs. Jess R.- whom as we found out have been married 8 years and have been employed there for 10! I love knowing that I am attending a place where clearly the staff is being treated well enough leaving them happy to treat the guests just as so. 
The food portions were amazingly giant and so beautiful. We had the clams, lobster bisque, stuffed lobster and the special surf and turf filet and lobster. Not one complaint about anything we had. Also when you sit down they serve you an amuse buche with your wine. Yum! 
 Jesse came out at the end, and brought us a wonderful dessert with banana milk and mousse bites. Lovely writing of happy anniversary in chocolate on the plate (special treatment ) 
The dinner was worth every penny mostly due to Jesse and his wife, being the best servers we have ever had. As we were leaving I couldn't but help hugging them. Thank you so much for making our night so special. Xoxoxoxoox
We will see you next year."}
{"text":"They don't \"officially\" offer a tasting menu, but they were happy to oblige when we made the inquiry.  The sommelier and waiter were wonderful and seemed excited to give us a great experience.  The bill at the end of the night was MUCH less than I would have expected."}
{"text":"Great food. The surf and turf was awesome the steak was mouth watering. The staff was very friendly and courtesy."}
{"text":"We were there for dinner on a Sunday night in early October. We had no reservation but were right away seated. Nice ambience and very friendly and attentive service - but a very expensive place - as we have expected for s restaurant in The Venetian. I started the classic way with the Lobster Bisque Soup - it was superb. My colleague had the Greenlip Mussels  - when you have been to New Zealand you know them very well - they are bigger than the PEI mussels and the shells shimmer somehow green. As a main I had the Barramundi from down under. Just a great fish unfortunately you can't get it very often in the US. I closed my meal with a cheese plate. Overall food an service was great a real good seafood place - definitely worth the price and also for revisiting."}
{"text":"We wanted a nice seafood dinner. Things went off the rails. Sommelier offered to decant our wine. He opened the bottle at table, then took bottle in the back, 15 min later the decanter appeared. Only 500 ML, what happened to our 750Ml..restaurant magic!!
Then later the waiter took our entre order. After waiting waiter brought a 6 oz salmon piece and a 3 oz Halibut piece. The 3 oz Halibut was $53.  For multiple reasons we were disappointed. Not likely to return."}
{"text":"Literally dreaming about coming back here!

We decided to go here for our client debrief (we had a conference at the Venetian) and my bosses birthday dinner. I found this place through, where else, yelp. They had reservations on open table, so I made on for 7:15pm. We called to see if they could push it back 15 minutes but we were told they had a few large parties and unfortunately could only do 7:15. When we got there on time, NO LARGE PARTIES TO BE SEEN!

Oh well, other than that, the service was great and food was impeccable. We even snuck in a small cake for our boss and they brought it out for us with a candle and cut it for us, free of charge. 

They have a small room in the blue circular tower you will see when you walk by. It's their wine cellar plus a private room for about 6-8 people. I would love to eat in there!

We ordered a few drinks and a few appetizers. 2 ahi tunas, steamed mussles and the crab cake. All of them-wow! The ahi was so fresh and actually very big for an appetizer. The crab cake wasn't mashed up crab, it was huge chunks of blue crab. The steamed mussels were in a delicious broth and also had a lot.

The chef even sent out a small tasting of crab and spinach on a cracker for us, also amazing! 

Everything looked so good that I had a hard time deciding what to get. The entire table wasn't sure! We ordered: scallops, seafood soup, seabass and ahi tuna dinner. Everyone said nothing but amazing things about their meal. I ordered the seabass and I wish the plate never ended. It came with a sweet corn on the bottom-wow. I think next time I will get the seafood soup, it was huge and you literally got to try it all. The broth was flavorful and light. 

I can easily say I will come back. Great service and great good!"}
{"text":"Get the aquaknox plateau!!!!! You won't regret it.  Yes it's expensive but this is fine dining ppl!!  I love stone claws and everything was so fresh.

My friend and I split the fish dish, which I forgot the name, and the crab stuffed Maine lobster.  It was very good.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the lobster stuffing was seasoned well.  I think I literally ate the whole plate!

If you're looking for a great seafood option, try this place.

It's very pretty and when we went it was practically empty!  Ask for a booth."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an excellent example of Las Vegas fine dining at its best. Some excellent highlights; the cocktails are fantastically made, the seafood trio appetizer is a MUST when dining here, and the service should be, and was, perfect. We truly enjoyed our experience here, and although there are many fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from, there are few that tend to get all those key elements and service standards working together harmoniously perfect such as AquaKnox."}
{"text":"If you want amazing service and food then you need to go here!!! Everything is top notch and worth the money.  Our first visit we had a phenomenal waiter named Andrew and had to visit again and request him.  The staff is all knowledgable about wine and how it pairs with the entrees you choose to enjoy.  We chose to do the tasting of the menu which is a 5 course meal paired with beer/wine.  AMAZING!!!! If you want a 5star experience then go visit the wonderful chefs and staff at Aquaknox!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Delicious food! Lovely atmosphere! Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"We always go here for special occasions. The food is superb.  The service is outstanding.  I love the crab stuffed lobster. I never can eat it all.  I tried the creme br√ªl√©e last time and very much enjoyed it.  If you are near the Venetian and really want to treat yourself, try this place."}
{"text":"excellent fresh seafood, service and atmosphere. One of the best restaurants in vegas. We loved the alaskan king crab legs and aquaknox seafood soup which was loaded with brazen sea bass, large shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams and a large lobster tail in a wonderful tomato broth."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a friend who's a big foodie, was nervous when we read the Yelp reviews and saw lots of posts talking about questionable service. Our service was fantastic tonight! We sat with Jesse who took great care of us, and all the food was amazing as promised. Great choice for special holidays or romantic dinner dates."}
{"text":"First impressions mean a lot...
We arrived with some friends who are from out of town and were originally seated at a table. The couple asked if we could have a booth instead and the hostess had us wait a minute or two at the table as they cleared one for us. Bonus points! 
Our waiter was nice and patient. He made some
Great recommendations and I went with a salad and Pan-Seared Barramundi. It was absolutely delicious! The fish was nice and moist with perfect seasoning. The salad was not drowned in salad dressing which was great."}
{"text":"I choose Aquaknox for Christmas eve dinner with my parents and bf.  My sole criteria were: non-steak, seafood preferred, on the strip, reservation availability on opentable, and of course, positive yelp reviews.  

First off, the place did not look as impressive as I'd hoped.  My expectations were probably too high.  In the dining area, there wasn't any cool watery dcor, because that's only in the bar area.  We were seated somewhere in the middle of the room, and it felt very cramped, like all the tables were too close.  For one thing, the chairs were huge (although comfortable) taking up a lot of space, difficult to get in and out and move around.  Service wasn't as smooth as I expected, nor comfortable or inviting.  

For appetizers, I ordered lobster bisque for myself and crab cakes for the table.  I don't understand the hype about lobster bisque.  It was creamy, has the essence of lobster, little chunks of lobster, and so it hit all the right marks, but didn't amaze me.  Maybe three days of lobster had something to do with it as well.  The crab cakes were also perfectly done, but not above and beyond.  I think I'm also jaded with an overabundance of crab cakes in my diet.  For the main, I ordered the John Dory.  I loved the lobster succotash, although a little bit sweet.  Tasting around the table, there were scallops, jumbo prawns, and ahi tuna.  Everything was perfectly cooked, and each had very different, yet interesting sides.  The prawns were probably the largest I had ever seen.  The tuna was a turn off because of its overly strong tapenade topping.  

For dessert we had the crme brulee and sticky toffee pudding.  I scoffed at the brulee - I could make a better one at home.  It was too soft when served.  I enjoyed the toffee, since it was the first one I ever had.  The coffee came with chocolate almond biscotti, which I appreciated.

If you're watching Blue Man, it's a toss up between this and Delmonico's next door.

In the end, I just felt guilty for all the fresh fish having been flown in to Vegas.  This is the desert!  I'll stick to seafood in San Francisco."}
{"text":"Underimpressed. Simply. I ordered ceviche and the barimundhi (can't remember the spelling) the ceviche was a jalape√±o ceviche and the menu explained that it came with some type of bread or cracker....it didnt. There weren't any jalape√±os either. Very flavorless. Just a bunch of lime juice poached shrimp.   The fish was okay. Nothing special. A little dry and served with mashed potatoes and field greens on top. Along with a veggie medly placed on the fish. There are much better places to eat at this resort.  The place was pretty dead at 8:30pm too. Unfortunately I won't be back."}
{"text":"Greatest seafood and steak restaurant. This is the only place I can eat at multiple times every time in Las Vegas. 
I call it the greatest hidden restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at this restaurant in a few years and I'm glad that I decided to give it a shot again! All I can say is....OMFG, everything we ordered was making me drool while  I was chewing. DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time and it was delicious! The service was incredible and the foot was amazing!!! I highly recommend eating here while visiting Vegas!!!! The steak, lobster, crab cakes everything delicious! The bread pudding was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Dined at Aquaknox recently and give it 5 Stars!! Excellent Service, Delicious Food, Modern & Chic Ambience.....I loved it here!

My girlfriends and I started the evening with a cocktail from the bar: A Blue Martini (forgot the name). Delicious but sweet, so we switched to wine during dinner. The restaurant wasn't busy so it wasn't loud. I loved the interior. Very modern and warm. We picked a booth and it was perfect for three of us.....intimate and good for catching up on things. 

Anyway, Thank You fellow Yelpers for recommending the Maine Lobster Bisque! I loved it and savored every bite. The best lobster bisque I've ever eaten. A little rich but flavored perfectly, and topped with little clumps of lobster. Perfect! I also had the Sweet Shrimp and Lump Crab Salad and it was excellent as well. I'm not a big eater, so those two appetizer-sized dishes were a perfect dinner for me. 

Another must-have: Crab Stuffed Whole Maine Lobster! My friend ordered it and we helped her finish it. It's massive....The whole lobster comes out on a huge plate and you just stare at it! The lobster was so tasty that it didn't even need butter. 

Sorry no dessert recommendations. Too full!

I must commend the staff at Aquaknox for their excellent service! The hostess who greeted us, the bartender who served our drinks at the bar, and of course our wait staff were all so welcoming and polite. Special thanks to our waiters, who were very attentive, open for suggestions/recommendations, accommodating, and skilled at their job. I noticed they even held out a white cloth to prevent splashing while pouring our waters! Thank You for making our visit to Aquaknox such an enjoyable experience! I will be back soon...."}
{"text":"Aquaknox is located in the Venetian/Palazzo right outside their Conference Center. Primarily a serving seafood, but do have a few selections of other meats.  Open table reservations worked great,  and  were seated right away.  In comparisons to other restaurants in the hotel, this one will be priced  a bit higher overall for the quantity of the food.  Enjoyed our meal overall, with an delicious appetizer of a crab cake, and entrees of Chilean Sea Bass and a Filet.  We added  on a pound of Alaskan Crab legs, and that was extremely pricey.  The Sea Bass  and Filet was excellent, but would forego on the add on for the crab legs as it was not worth the extreme price.  If you go, and there is only two of you, request a booth, as they are very private and make a great dining experience.  Overall, we would visit again for special occasion with full knowledge the expense of the meal."}
{"text":"Aquaknox is a 3.5, but I'll round up to a 4.   My girlfriend and I sat at the bar for drinks and dinner.  The bar area was so nice, lively, and fun.   I had my standard Captain and Coke and ordered some Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and a Sea Scallop dinner.  The shrimp cocktail was good but pricey.   Four large shrimps for $18.   The sea scallop dinner was $35 for four HUGE scallops.  They were served on top of a sweet potato puree and mushrooms.  The scallops were very good but not the best I've had.  

I was almost done with my Captain and Coke when the bartender accidentally refilled the whole thing with Coke.  He realized his mistake immediately and gave me another free drink.   As he pushed it toward me, one of the drinks spilled onto the pants and shoes of the man sitting next to me.  He gave him a free drink and appetizer which was nice.  

I really liked the atmosphere and would come back again.  I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Well really it is believable I've been a fan for years.  Brought my boss and coworkers in while in town, the meal and service were impeccable. My group had never seen how \"I roll\" (Lol) They did NOT disappoint. There were 6 in our group, we had oysters on the half shell, my boss and I split the 2 lb lobster stuffed with crab (Amazing! )  Our non-seafood fans raved about their 14 ounce NY steak. Aquaknox remains my favorite restaurant of all time.  It is worth every cent to take part in the Aquaknox experience. Thank you to Managers Brian and Andrew for creating such a wonderful experience for us! If you're ever in Monterey, please let us return the favor :-)

{"text":"The staff was very friendly and attentive, but the food was just average.  The steak was large, but rather tough, and the mashed potatoes were a little watery. The seafood portiins were also large, and the tuna was tender, but the prawns were too chewy. 

We made the staff aware of the food allergies of some of the members in our party, yet one of my group still had a severe allergic reaction to sesame and ended up in the hospital. Considering all the other options in the Venitian and Pallazo, I don't think I will be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"The oyster platter, lobster bisque and crab cake were spectacular. Will be back soon. The bartender was very friendly and informative."}
{"text":"Summary:  This is a lovely spot to relax between the Venetian and Palazzo.  My wife and I love seafood and Aquaknox gets it fresh and with a nice variety.  We were there the week before Christmas, 2012.

Food:  4 stars
We started with a sampler of a dozen oysters on the half shell.  They were very fresh and very tasty.  We both had simple grilled fish (the special) over a nicely done risotto.  All in all, a solid meal as expected based on reputation and price point.

Wine:  5 stars
For the price point and the vibe of the resort we expected an extensive list, a well trained sommelier, and a tip toward Italian.  All was as expected and more so.  The sommelier, a young man named Scott, was well versed in his list and very personable.  We found a '01 Moccagatta Bric Balin Barbaresco, a very happy and unexpected joy!

Service:  2 stars
Maybe it was the lack of staff because of the season, but our waiter was simply not good enough for this price point.  Adequate is a failure in fine dining.

Ambiance:  4 stars
They do a nice job of shielding the patrons from most of the hustle and bustle of the resorts.  Be sure to insist on a table away from the front when making reservations and you'll be golden."}
{"text":"O. M. G! I'm so sad that I can't pack AquaKnox into my suitcase and bring it back to Seattle with me. I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! The BF and I decided to return on our last night in town and had an even better experience than our first visit - something I didn't think was possible. 

When you make reservations ask to sit in Chris Godfrey's section. He is a great server and made our time so much more enjoyable.  We had him the first time (two nights prior), and he remembered us. He wasn't overbearing, but made sure we were taken care of like VIPs. Even the manager recognized us! He arranged for us to get a special appetizer from Sous Chef James, who we later got to meet so we could personally compliment him. He earned it. 

This time around we dined on a crab cocktail, lobster bisque, delicious yellowtail sashimi, salmon for me, prawns for the BF, lobster mash potatoes (you can have them separate from the halibut dish!!!), pomegranate mojitos, and creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. Forget food baby - I had food twins! 

I may come back annually solely to visit this restaurant. Well played Vegas, well played."}
{"text":"Came to this swanky place to get a drink before heading off to the club. Also, used that as an excuse to use the finely decorated bathroom. Sometimes my bladder makes the drinking decisions for me. 

Ordered a rasberry vodka thingy at the bar and, yes, it was pretty good.  Don't take my word for it though. I lost the ability to taste vodka a few months back.

The bartender was friendly and managed to have all the answers to whatever questions we had. As in, \"hey, you're closing, you know any restaurants in the Venetian that serve seafood that are open? C'mon, man. We need a lobster fix.\""}
{"text":"Great seafood restaurant. The oyster appetizer was great, came with some good sauces (Champagne Vinegrette was my fave). The salmon and tuna entrees were a hit as well. 
Nice decor and an extensive wine menu."}
{"text":"This place has phenomenal high quality seafood and offers some of the best service i've received, that goes to say A LOT! My husband brought me here for a birthday once and I was definitely impressed! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I went here on a date with my boyfriend while visiting La Vegas last weekend. I was really extremely happy with the great service. Everyone was very polite and cheerful, although we were probably one of the last parties of the night. 

For appetizer, we shared the clams. THEY WERE THE BEST PART OF DINNER. The clams were cooked just how I like them and the broth it comes in is \"to die for\". Don't forget to ask for extra bread for the broth, trust me you'll want it. I ordered the barramundi, and I must say that it was cooked to perfection. The potato puree was super smooth and tasted awesome with the light dressing on it. My boyfriend ordered some sort of shrimp dish, and he said that he liked it. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful.

We decided on not ordering dessert because we were too full, but they brought us a complimentary one anyway. They served us \"adult milk and cookies\". it came with a small fresh baked cookie and a shot glass filled with what I think was a mixture of milk, sugar, cinnamon, and rum. It was super yummy and was just the right sweetness.

All together I believe our bill was just over $90 for the two of us. 

I had a great experience at AquaKnox, but the reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the placement of the restaurant. It is placed in an open area where you can hear all the hustle and bustle of the slot machines and night clubs, and the only thing that would have made that dinner absolutely perfect was if the restaurant was more secluded and romantic. Other than that, I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Simply put, one of the best new American seafood restaurants in Vegas today.

Keeping it real, skip the lounge that I have always recommended.  Menu changes no longer make it the place to grab a quick bite.  Opt for the comfortable, contemporary ambiance of the main dining room instead.  While the executive chef has changed, taking with him the best of the best, enough remains and new dishes added that still carry the cuisine.

In general, seafood is very fresh and always perfectly cooked.  Never any albumin on fillets.  No bouncing scallops or shrimp.

Top starters include an outstanding wild blue crab cake (very little filler, dusted in flour and fried crisp served with a chayote slaw and a gently spiced creole remoulade).  Very well balanced dish with great texture, sweetness paired with an acidic punch.  The Maine lobster louie also excellent with just cooked through, firm and sweet lobster with traditional veg (I'm not a bunny but this is good).  A kicked up, creamy 1,000 island dressing and heirloom tomatoes with greater acidity and lower sweetness truly compliment the lobster.

Mains are simple but perfectly executed.  A perfectly pan roasted, moist, Alaskan halibut pairs perfectly with the chili flavor of a piquillo pepper relish.  The fish soup outstanding.  A acidic tomato base, the hint of saffron and perfectly cooked chunks of lobster, firm john dory, tender PEIs, briny clams, and sweet prawns.   A porcini dusted, perfectly cooked moonfish served with a red wine reduction dashi sauce is incredible for it's complexity and depth of flavor.  Mushroom and fish?  It works with the earthiness adding an unexpected umame finish.  Finally, the Georges Bank Scallops with blood orange butter, amazing.  Perfectly seared and cooked just through.  Incredibly sweet.  The blood orange butter adding even more richness and acidity to brighten the dish further.  Yes there are sides but who cares.  The scallops are the focus.

Outstanding service.  Very friendly, efficient, and accommodating.  Some dishes were shared, portions divided and individually plated in the kitchen.  

Very good wine list heavily centered around whites that pair perfectly with their cuisine.  Vegas resort markup.

When it comes to Aquaknox, remember the dieters mantra, \"when you see food, eat it!\""}
{"text":"We celebrated my wife's 50th birthday tonight at AquaKnox. Service was spectacular. My Mom and Dad ordered the lobster bisque and the crab cakes and we had the same. Flavors were melt in your mouth awesome! For the entree we all had the salmon. Two of us had it blackened. I have to say it was the most flavorful and memorable salmon dish I have ever had. Seasoning was spot on. The salmon was served on top of something called black forbidden rice which was bursting with flavors I can't even put into words. Awesome! They brought out some complimentary cheese appetizers and tuna tartar with wasabi cream sauce which were wonderful. 

For desert we had the bread pudding which was superb. Hot out of the oven with vanilla bean ice cream on the side. They also served us some complimentary champagne which was very nice of them. All in all it was a five star experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I can't review the food because I never made it past the front door lol. The hostess at the stand was completely helpless and once I finally got to speak with the the gm  Mr. Meneffe he was even more worthless. I wish I could of enjoyed my experience since it is a beautiful property. Maybe if they had a better leader my stay could of been more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Ian is amazing!!! Thank you for the great food and drinks. We got the tasting trio and it was very delicious."}
{"text":"WARNING: Beware of the servers.

First, we ordered water. They served us bottled still water when we clearly did NOT order it. And I've always had servers ask still, sparkling, or tap. This server didn't even ask! And they kept refilling our cups without us asking and without letting us know how many bottles we've used so we ended up paying for many bottles of water. So I guess let them know if you want tap water instead of bottled water. I don't mind paying for bottled water if that's what I'm expecting to do but we didn't even know until the bill came.

For appetizers we ordered the Seafood Plateau but it was $79 and serves only TWO people. Granted it does come with a variety of items but our server suggested this appetizer for our group of 8 but failed to mention the price. So $79 times 4 plus our main entrees equals a hefty tip for him. That Bastard. 

But the food alone was delicious and fresh so if the service was better, then I would have given it 4 stars easily. But since they tried to sell us every expensive thing on the menu it deserves only one star. I will never return. I've never experienced this before at any other upscale establishment so I guess that's why I felt so cheated.

But if you do want to eat here then get the ponzu and sake oyster shooters. We had multiple shots."}
{"text":"Everything was amaaaaaazing and high class. 
Expensive but so worth it for the service and food. Everyone is so nice and the atmosphere is relaxed yet classy. Love it"}
{"text":"I want to give this 3 1/2 stars. I really think this is a typical seafood restaraunt. I had a halibut dish and it was average. It didn't explode in my mouth, so I can't really rate this place high.

Their service was great though. We had a birthday dinner for a friend and she was surprised with a nice big dessert that all of us shared. The thing I like about this place is it is quiet even though its in the middle of the walkway between Venetian and Palazzo.

Good Friends always can make up for good food. Good conversation can always make good friends, best friends!"}
{"text":"Anyone saying the food is not expensive must be part of the 1%.  We grabbed a drink at the bar prior to sitting down for our meal and a Makers Mark on the rocks was $12 (without tip).  That's the only price I'll mention, but figured it was a good indicator for anyone reading this review.

The meal was exquisite ... I'm from North Carolina, and frequent the beaches of NC/SC, so I know good seafood.  Being in Las Vegas, I was hesitant to visit an upscale seafood restaurant, but AquaKnox did not dissapoint.  I started off with a Lobster Bisque and had to do everything to not to pick it up and start licking the bowl.  As for my entree, I had the tuna (rare of course), and it was extremely good.  Because we were jet lagged and technically eating our dinner at 11pm, we were too tired to do dessert, so we called it a night.  

Quick and Dirty Review:

Atmosphere - Unique, but nothing too special (located within the corridor between Palazzo and Venetian hotels).
Food - Delicious ... pricey, but delicious
Service - Good service ... attentive and knowledgeable with the menu based on our appetite.

Summary - Although pricey, it was extremely delicious and worth a date night while on vacation."}
{"text":"We really had a terrific meal along with a great experience! Nick B our waiter, was so knowledgeable about every dish, attentive without being a pain and just a wonderful guy...he truly added to our evening! The food was delicious and prepared to perfection. We will be sure to eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I can only give 2 stars when you have an expectation and the restaurant has poor service and stratospheric, mesospheric prices.  The Capital Grille makes this place look like a healthier, far costlier Long John Silvers.  

The plus (singular) was the lobster cocktail, notwithstanding the shell chips and pervasive claw meat.  

The negatives were after the trade show at 5pm in an empty bar my $7 Heineken took 10 minutes and the cocktail waitress had zero (0) clue what was going on and said \"sorry I'm busy\", and the place was empty.  For dinner our group of 18 had a head waiter who was cocky and arrogant.  I think he showed only a modicum of respect to who he thought was paying the bill.  The entree portions were really small.  From what I recall the scallop entree my co-worker had was three scallops and he ate them and sarcastically grinned at me.  My $36 fish had to be just 5 ounces, seriously, and due to the size of the group it was not warm on the surface just inside.  I really, REALLY like the Ca√±onita in Venetian and 5-starred after multiple visits, but Aqua-Knox has portion sizes weirder than it's name and our arrogant waiter must be a millionaire doing his job for fun."}
{"text":"Our dinner last night was the best I'd ever had in Vegas!  The Tomahawk steak surf and turf was absolutely delicious!  Our servers, Carlos and Nick, were very accommodating and attentive. Fernando G and his chef ? staff created our fabulous, tasty meal from start to finish.  Then they nailed it with delicious desserts by Mercedes Anna.  Aquanox management could not have topped this high roller, dining experience off with anything other a $1million jackpot!"}
{"text":"AquaKnox set the bar for all the restaurants we ate at in the Palazzo/Venetian. My family and I are loyal seafood lovers so we couldn't resist reserving after seeing the reviews, and of course, we like to experience fine dining every once in a while. We at here on our first night in Vegas for the NYE weekend.

It's a very fancy and formal restaurant - it had a similar vibe to Nobu but maybe even higher class. The staff were so precise and made the whole dining experience memorable. They didn't miss a beat.

Food:

Appetizer: Lobster Bisque - best one I've ever had! I thought Mastro's in Malibu was the best but theirs puts Mastro's to shame! It was lighter in creaminess so it didn't overwhelm ones stomach. We also had King Crab legs. I usually would order this even though I love them because of all the work it takes to actually get to the meat, but as it turns out, they already cracked it for us so eating was easy and yummy!

Entree: Lobster, Filet Mignon, Grilled Salmon, Scallops - all very good but the Lobster was the best - duh!

Dessert: they had a special that night and my family split a triple chocolate mousse cake with ice cream. 

The presentation of each dish was very well thought out. I almost didn't want to eat it because it would tarnish it's beauty. In any case, we didn't find another restaurant that was as good as this even though we went to a couple more fine dining places later. AquaKnox is the best of the best in Las Vegas.  Of course, it's also located in the Venetian/Palazzo which has the most amount of award winning chefs in all of Las Vegas so no surprise there. Can't wait to repeat the experience!"}
{"text":"Well that was one of the best dinners I've ever eaten. Service was exemplary and ambience was lovely. Had a beautiful dinner with a few friends I hadn't seen in years. We laughed and talked and were given plenty of kind attention by several waitstaff. We were made to feel really welcome and special. Wonderful evening thanks to these lovely employees  compliments to the chef as well!"}
{"text":"Very good food. October 2015 was the first time I gave this restaurant a try. It was very well worth it. I can only describe the food as fusion between fresh seafood with a hint of Asian. For example, if you direct you attention to my picture, my crab cake was topped with Apple salad. The apple salad closely resemble to what I had before in Thai restaurant. Kinda weird (but in a delightful way, hence the 4 stars review). Other main dishes were just as tasty. If there is any room for improvement, I would have to say that the sear Foie Gras was tiny bit over cook; otherwise, this restaurant would deserve 5 stars. Oh, by the way, Lobster Bisque is a must!!"}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for dinner one night in Vegas. We ordered the Seafood Plateau and Maine lobster bisque to start with. The Seafood plateau was large enough for 4 but its recommended for 2. We were on the full side when we had finished the entire platter. 
For our entrees, I ordered the crab stuffed lobster. My bf ordered the filet mignon and grilled whole fish(this was for the both of us to share). The server had asked us prior to deboning the fish if we would like him to bring the fish back after deboning or if we wouldn't mind him doing it in front of us. I told him to just have at it at at table side. I wanted to watch how it was done. The seafood was very fresh and light. I loved the combo of the crab stuffed lobster. It was very flavorful. No need for drawn butter. The steak was cooked to my bf's specifications. The fish was delightful. It was citrisy and perfectly seasoned. 
You would expect good service since you're paying a good amount for dinner and it didn't disappoint. This is why I love to pay a little extra for food just to get wonderful service. :)"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night before a show. Overall it was fine but we had expected a bit more. 

Started with drinks..... WOW what high prices!!! $35 for an Oban!!!! $24 for Macallan???  I love Single Malt but that is out of bounds!!! I think whoever set the bar prices had been sampling the wares first.

On to dinner .... I had barramundi and it was very good. Others had scallops, advertised as \"phenominal\" by the waiter, but they were only good.

And that is kind of just how it went. Fine, not phenominal.  Should you go? Well ..... I wouldn't go out of my way to do that particularly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very pretentious for what it is.  The ambiance is not commensurate with the prices in the menu. Specially, you can hear music pumping from other parts of hotel and my chair was stained as were parts of the carpet.  Dishes are expensive, which I am okay with if the ambiance, food and service are to par but this was not the case.  The food was good but not amazing. I felt that the waitstaff had an arrogance to them that was off putting. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Great food. Below average staff. 

We came here for the oysters and steak. The food was amazing. We ordered 2 rounds of oysters (loved the Virginia ones) and clams (Virginia as well). Some people had steaks,  fish, and the lobster bisque as entrees. 

The service we received was overall confusing. I still can not distinguish who our server was. It was hard to get someone's attention to grab the bill and also just for a water refill. 

Also whoever cleared the oyster tray from our table spilled the leftover water all over one of the guys at the table and also into his glass of wine so he couldn't even finish it. We didn't even get an apology or something to wipe up the spill. 

For the price we spent for dinner (we were a party of 9 so the bill came to about $700) we received poor service."}
{"text":"Thomas and Mark were our servers, great people! They knew the menu, gave us great recommendations, and took excellent care of us throughout our meal. Great birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Invited to experience the skills of new Executive Chef Deric Meininger by Aquaknox General Manager Robert Menefee it was just after the restaurant's 5:30pm opening on Saturday that four friends sat down in the Forbes 4-Star establishment, and treated to a seven course tasting intended to showcase the newly crafted menu during one of Las Vegas' slowest weekends it is a wonder that the restaurant has flown under my radar for so long.

Owned by a restaurant group but lacking the marquee of much of The Venetian's celebrity chef offerings Aquaknox is the sort of restaurant many may walk past without even giving a second thought, yet much like Bartolotta at the Wynn those lucky enough to take the plunge are rewarded by refined environs, exemplary service, and the sort of seafood not commonly thought of in the middle of the desert, an opening amuse of raw dayboat scallops atop a crispy base both creamy and sweet while a follow-up oyster trio presented three varieties of briny bivalves in manners intended to highlight the best of each - the simple shooter especially impressive with a sweet start giving way to salinity before dissipating in a trail of heat.

Offered a complimentary wine pairing from which three of us opted for very small pours it was with course two of the tasting that the menu first veered from the ocean and spontaneously created to compliment an apricot and pear heavy Riesling a thick slice of liver shined, the caramelized exterior and smooth sapor finding surprising balance in cocoa tones reined in by the vegetal gastrique while crispy brioche and candied nuts added plenty of texture, the sorbet seemingly unnecessary to the plate but well placed when considering the wine.

Visited more than once by Chef Meininger, a quiet man despite recent stays in the kitchens of Gordon Ramsay, course three was the only item of the evening not of his own creation and considered a staple since the restaurant's inception the Aquaknox Fish Soup was every bit the signature it is billed to be, the spicy saffron broth bathing no less than a half-dozen varieties of seafood with pearls of fregula adding additional texture as top notes of pepper permeated the palate without overwhelming at all.

Again showing a deft hand with sea-life, both hearty and delicate, plates four and five featured fish, crustacean, as well as mollusk and with the meaty Wahoo delicately perched atop a rich ragout lightened by fruity chutney the \"surf and surf\" proved even more inspired as snappy prawns and a buttery scallop were each highlighted by their accoutrements, the former leaning slightly Mediterranean while the later took a more French approach - the finishing vinegar an especially welcomed addition atop the creamy squash base.

Taking a chance in finishing with beef it was with another trio that savories wound up and although the Ribeye proved a bit tougher than any of us would have preferred both the Filet and the Strip were fork tender and nicely seasoned, the flavor imbued by peppers and onions allowing the meat to stand up to the booming Cave Blend served alongside.

Once again intending to showcase the restaurant's best items it was to a triplet of tasters alongside one central plate that we were treated for dessert and with a delicious yet heavy Tawny guiding the way not a single item of the group was less than exemplary, the stunning key lime presentation as light as a cloud while banana cream pie was presented as a sort of Mille-Feuille, the bread pudding trending more like spongecake with rich butterscotch notes flooding the palate in each bite.

Undoubtedly receiving VIP treatment, but witnessing every table around us treated nearly the same, it was after a short tour of the restaurant that our meal would end and with espressos and teas served alongside a duo of sweet n' spicy mignardises it can only be said that Aquaknox more than exceeded expectations - a return visit for some a la carte options, the wood oven lobster, and a full-sized bread pudding inside the temperature controlled wine chamber almost inevitable to occur in the months to come."}
{"text":"Wow this is a wonderful dining experience!! The waiters were so great. The food is magnificent!!!
My husband & I had the Lobster Bisk & the Blue King crab cakes. Perfect. Highly recommend this place for great seafood & a nice quaint dining experience."}
{"text":"Never disappointed at the menu, atmosphere or service. Excellent dining experience after a show. My go to restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to trying this restaurant and it was a bit of a disappointment. The restaurant was not busy and it took 45 mins to get our food. We had a party of ten who all ordered surf and turf and every single steak came out cold and very low quality. The second round of replacement steaks were chewy and dried out. The lobster bisque soup was delicious as well as the salmon! Highly recommend. 

However, the manager and staff were very nice and gave us 4 free desserts to split with the table and comped two of the 9 steaks. 

Stick with the seafood here and I'm sure you will be satisfied!"}
{"text":"My second time here with family for dinner during Christmas time and everything were great.  Seafood are very fresh and high quality.  Good customer service.  I would definitely go back again and again next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great seafood restaurants are a rarity here in the desert, but I feel like at Aquaknox I've found a gem! 

The atmosphere is very elegant, with a bit of a nautical twist. Each table adorned in white linen, and garnished with blue goblets & wine glasses. My boyfriend & I were celebrating an anniversary that evening, so we were ideally seated in a booth that was intimate, as well as comfortable. 

Service, unquestionably superior. I would expect nothing less from a restaurant of such high stature. Allen, our server- was very accommodating. He executed very wonderful suggestions, that MADE our experience. 

To start out, we got a vase full of long crispy bread sticks & a house smoked salmon dip. Let me tell you that if it weren't socially unacceptable...I would have licked the dish that the salmon dip came in, no problem. Needless to say, it was excellent, & I crave it daily. 

Next up to bat- Crab Cake & Lobster Bisque. Being a previous resident of New England & a connoisseur of food- I feel like a have a very firm palate when it comes to a few things, crab cakes & lobster bisque included. The Crab Cake was incredible, beautifully seasoned & served over a citrus flavored bed of corn relish. As for the Lobster Bisque, it wasn't too creamy- just perfect. It was really comforting & nostalgic to have some good New England food, without the 5 hour long flight. 

Seafood Plateau- Overwhelmingly fresh, standard assortment (oysters, oyster shooters, clams, mussels, lobster, crab claws, prawns). The ponzu oyster shooters...to die for! I was also a big fan of the champagne vinegar sauce that came with the oysters. Also, probably the biggest prawns I have ever seen. Very impressive! 

John Dory was my main course. Excellent suggestion from our server, Allen! Unlike any other fish I have ever had. It was sauteed on one side only, giving it an ambidextrous texture. I loved the crunch from the sauteed side, but the soft side exposed its sweetness, & also gave it a buttery finish. John Dory definitely tasted like fish, which was admirable to say the least. A lot of times, when seafood is over prepared, it loses that oceanic taste. Frankly, I would like my fish to taste like fish. The lobster succotash & sweet corn broth that it was served over was also delightful. It did a great job of complimenting the fish, without overshadowing it, with its bold flavors. 

Now, at this point- being a girl of 5'4\"/95 lbs, I'm surprised that I wasn't already stuffed & in a food coma. But, there really is always room for dessert. Apple Tarte Tatin- sweet savory apple chunks, covered in caramel served beside a salted caramel ice cream. I thought the salted caramel ice cream to be very inventive & appropriate!!! Creme Brulee- my one true dessert staple. I enjoyed the vanilla beans that were tucked under the custard, it made for a very yummy last bite. 

Aquaknox was a great success! I look forward to making this our new go-to venue for seafood. The food exceeded my expectations, & the service was right on point."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. But unfortunately our server was very satisfactory. My family and I went there for Christmas Eve Dinner. It was a party of 10. My biggest pet peeve is discussing whose going to pay for what during dinner so we coordinated before going that we will split the check three ways so there was no confusion. I discretely told the waiter the plan so he knows and for some reason he didn't get it and not only proceeded to be confused Very Loudly that other tables we're turning around to look at us. So embarrassing. I almost felt like he was doing it on purpose. Being very vocal on asking whose paying for what etc. Never again. Although the food was great.. not worth being put on the spot and embarrassed."}
{"text":"This review is for the New Years Eve Prix Fixe dinner. For 150, you expect the meal to be special or at least memorable, this was neither. There were only four courses, two of which were barely warm.  The crabcake was very fresh, but lacked the big chunks of crab that you should see at a nice seafood restaurant. It would have been better if it was hot. The truffled kabocha pumpkin gnocci was the only dish that impressed me. Again, not hot enough. For the entree, I expected to see lobster or crab as one of the options, after all it was New Years Eve in Vegas! Not so, I ended up eating chicken coq au vin, which was moist but I wanted something more gourmet than chicken. Beef was an option but I don't eat it. The dessert would have been good but it contained peanut butter, which I despise. A lot of people have peanut allergies, so I can't believe this was the only option they had. And they never even announced that it had peanut butter, they should have noted it on the menu. My gf did the wine pairing, she did not like most of the wines. I would never come here for a holiday prix fixe ever again. The service was friendly, but a little slow considering the place wasn't exactly packed. They took forever to bring the bill and process it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food. Had the steamed clams, they are excellent!  The best part is the broth. Ask for extra bread to dip in the broth. Then followed the clams with lobster bisque. Outstanding (probably the best I've ever had). Comes with a little breadstick with lumps of crab meat. For main entree, wife had the salmon, which was very good and I had the crab stuffed lobster. Although it was pricey ($98) it was plenty of food and was really good. We also tried the blue raspberry martini. Also very good. Expect to pay for the great food but if you're reading this review chances are you'll be just fine."}
{"text":"My experience it was okay, maybe I had high expectations, I order some oysters the crab cake the shrimp cocktail, then finish with muscles and the branzino, muscles it was good but it came out kind of cold not the way I like it. The branzino it well seasoning, it was a good for one time trying.
Service good..."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful flavors and service.  We made reservations for a party of 6 during the last evening of Restaurant week.  Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and shown to our own private dining room with a single table for 6.  Immediately, they asked us if the music volume was ok and promptly lowered the volume to accommodate our enthusiastic conversations.  The inner decor was marine life focused with a tranquil and peaceful spa-like vibe, which greatly entertained our party, as one of the ladies is an avid diver.  

The first course consisted of a choice of the following delights: 
1) Lobster Bisque with Maine Lobster, Caviar, Creme Fraiche 
2) Crab Cakes with Marinated Vegetable Relish, Citrus Aioli, Petite Mache 
3) Halloumi & Watermelon with Shishito Peppers, Basalmic Vinegar 
4) Romaine Hearts & Treviso Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese Caesar

I opted for the crab cakes, which were excellent!  The citrus aioli totally made the dish.  I tasted the lobster bisque, which was also delish with delicate, but oh so rich creme fraiche.  The real winner of course #1 took me by surprise; the halloumi & watermelon salad.  Boyfriend ordered it because he is allergia a los mariscos (I know you all remember that phrase from Spanish 101 practice work!)  Back to the story, being the goat cheese-aholic that I am, I would have ordered this dish if I understood what halloumi was.  I will never make that mistake again!  Hailing from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus,  halloumi is a semi-hard, unripened brined cheese made from a mixture of goat and sheep milk, and sometimes also cow milk.  It has a high melting point, and often fried or grilled, with a strong savory bite, with a slightly creamy texture.  Mmmm mmmm gewd!

Before course #2 arrived, the manager spoiled our party with a 3 special treats, which he explained were some of his absolute favorite things on the menu.  
1) Smoked king salmon with pickled vegetables and buttery crunchy toasts  
2) NY littleneck clams with garlic & chili in white wine herb butter 
3) Hollander mussels in chardonnay herb butter broth.  
Honestly, this free little treat might have been the absolute best dishes to grace our table.  We were all politely sharing, but fighting our animal instinct to greedily ravage these dishes and lick the bottom of the bowls clean!

The second course consisted of a choice of the following indulgences:
1) Pacific White Prawns with Pearl Couscous, Lobster Cream, Cherry Tomatoes, Scampi Garlic Butter 
2) Prime Ribcap Steak Frites with Roasted Shallot Red Wine Glaze 
3) Mt. Cook Alpine King Salmon with Vegetable Ragout, Buerre Blanc 
4) Roasted Jidori Chicken - Celeriac Puree, Glazed Baby Carrots, Sauce Ver Jus
The whole party's orders were split between the prawns and the steak.  My only complaint is that I was torn between the salmon and prawns.  Having a less than stellar salmon experience the previous night led me to try the prawns.  All of the steaks were cooked to perfection.

The third course consisted of a choice of these treats:
Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee or Homemade Ice Cream Sundae
I think the entire table ordered and enjoyed the creme brulee, which was as delicious as it was beautiful.

I will be back.  Thank you for an evening of culinary bliss and thoughtful service Aquaknox!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for the week. I love seafood and all I wanted for my birthday was a nice seafood dinner without the circus or the celebrity chef. Found this place while searching YELP and I'm so glad we did because it was FABULOUS! Everyone from the young woman at the front to the manager wished me a happy birthday and made us so comfortable that it was like being with friends. 

The real gems here were our waiter Jesse and his beautiful wife Tonya who took great care of us. I couldn't decide which dish to get and Jesse made some excellent recommendations! The surf and turf was out of this world. Our appetizers were amazing and my \"aquatini\" was so good that I drank 3 of them! 

Unfortunately we were so stuffed we ended up taking a lot of leftovers and were trying to figure out what to with them since we were seeing a show and Jesse was so great that he packed up everything and held it in the fridge for us until the show was over. 

To say they made my birthday amazing is putting it lightly. This restaurant had the best food I've ever had and the personal service made it spectacular! 

I would recommend them highly. It wasn't a stuffy environment, which is something I wanted to avoid, but it was still very classy. We had a nice private booth and were treated fabulous!"}
{"text":"I planned a dinner for 20, and Valerie was great to work with. She was always prompt with emails and was very accommodating. The dinner turned out nice, and everyone seemed to be pleased. Our server and his team, I wish I remembered his name, was very attentive and welcoming. I will say that I was definitely impressed by the service. 
The food was good as well. I wished that we were able to have access to the full menu, but with a large party, it was not available. Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"Wow, they really did a great job.  We had a sommelier, (rare these days) waiter, assistant waiter all of whom were very attentive and did a fantastic job.  We didn't like the first wine we selected, so it was whisked away and replaced with something that we really enjoyed--that's the right way to do it!  Food was absolutely delicious, they started us off with a complimentary crab cake, very tasty.  We ordered poke, burrata salad, and the seafood plateau, all superb!  Everything on the seafood plateau was perfectly fresh and perfectly prepared--that's rare for a big assortment like that.  We really didn't have room for desert, but they brought us a tasty bite of coconut cake that was a great closing touch.  I think I have a new favorite restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times. Always exceptional service and food!! Absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"Let's start with AMAZING! From start to finish the experience at AquaKnox was excellent. Upon arrival we were immediately seated for our 7:30pm reservation which is always a great start to a dining experience for me. Our party of two was warmly greeted by our server who was quick to take drink orders and offer a watermelon amuse-bouch√©. We reviewed the menu and decided on the Pan Seared Halibut with maine lobster corn succotash, corn nage, black truffle, ocean greens and the Grilled White Prawns citrus marinated, shallot-white wine reduction, pearl couscous, heirloom tomatoes, roasted piquillo pepper, capers, arugula, basil, parmesan, lemon butter along with the SAUT√âED BABY SPINACH baby mixed spinach, extra virgin olive oil, garlic as a accompaniment. We cap the dinner off with the Sticky Toffee dessert that wasn't my favorite but after such an amazing meal it really didn't matter. AquaKnox is definitely worth the trip if you're looking for seafood in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had a late dinner here. Between us we had the prawns and the cra cake appetizer for our meal. Both were delicious, but he prawns were to die for! 

Despite having two servers we still waited almost 15 min before having our drink order taken and there was definitely an air of disappointment when we didn't order apps, two entrees and dessert."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible! It is a four star restaurant that deserves five! The service was impeccable. Our waiters met our every need! We had our 10 month old daughter with us and they welcomed her with open arms and made sure she was well taken care of. The food was outstanding. And they have a great wine list and a full bar! Highly recommended!! A must if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had the Lobster Bisque per the other reviews. It was simply amazing. I am from the east coast of Canada originally so I know good lobster bisque and this was awesome. I also had the lobster infused with crab. That was not bad but not mind blowing. I had an aquatini which was amazing as well and i highly suggest it!

Over all great experience and good place to eat for seafood."}
{"text":"Food was well presented. Very tasty. Romantic atmosphere. We sat in a booth and it was very private. The server was outstanding. He was very personable."}
{"text":"This is our second time at Aquaknox, and our second time ordering their seafood plateau.  Worth the money, and quite filling for two people.  The seafood included in the plateau are crab legs, lobster, 3 types of oysters, clams, oyster shots, and ceviche.  Seafood is fresh, hostesses are accommodating, and overall it's a wonderful dining experience.  Will be returning again next time we stay at Palazzo or Venetian.  Don't forget to charge your bill to your room to accumulate points!"}
{"text":"A hopping place (like there is a different type of restaurant in Vegas), the atmosphere was electric, loved the decor and booths that created a nice buffer for the hustle and bustle on restaurant row. 

Wine list is very extensive with some amazing wines - we had a lovely Chardonnay. I expanded my horizons and split the beet and watermelon salad - lovely if you are a fan of both of those. Surf and turf was next on our list - the right choice - our waiter made sure each of our steaks were to our liking (medium rare and medium). Lobster was cut perfectly to ensure you could get all of the meat out. Came with standard sides - mashed potatoes and asparagus. 

The service was fantastic - had two waiters who were very attentive. In typical fashion the manager popped by to say hi and check on our experience. 

Would recommend this to anyone in Vegas looking for great seafood!"}
{"text":"Ambiance sucks!  Why these large resorts imsist on playing the same music, too loud, regardless of venue is cheap and tawdry.  No bread, just sticks, is a missed opportunity. Superb service, very good food."}
{"text":"I recently had a couple business meetings here. This place is fantastic, the service is excellent and apps are so tasty!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here and had a pretty good time! To start, instead of bread, they bring you these long crackers and a smoked salmon cream cheese dip, which was a really nice way to start the dinner. For appetizers we had a roasted beet, watermelon and blue cheese salad, as well as the smoked fish plate. The salad was really awesome. They key was getting a bit of everything on the fork and opening wide: super delicious. The smoked fish plate was alright, though not as good as the salad, and I ended up being more into the pickled veggies that came with the appetizer than the fish itself.

For entrees, we had the halibut and scallops. The fish was standard good, but the best part of the halibut dish was the marscopone mashed potatoes and tomatoes it came with. Really tasty. Was licking the plate with my fork. The scallops were also pretty good, seared on the outside and buttery on the inside though maybe a tad salty. Once again though, the sauce and accompaniments that came with the scallops were also quite good. We also got a side dish of vegetables, which I highly highly recommend, not just because the veggies taste good, but because you might want to actually eat something.

We got two desserts. The olive oil semolina cake with blue berry compote and orange basil sorbet just wasnt that good: the cake part got totally lost amid the strong flavors of the blueberry and sorbet. I guess its going for something subtle and interesting, but it didnt work. However, the flourless chocolate cake, a warm chocolaty concoction with a cup of caramel was super delicious. Definitely on the sweet side, but it had enough real chocolate and caramel flavor to balance the sweetness. Plus if you dont feel self conscious you can just drink the caramel from the little cup it comes in. Yum yum yum.

The service here is great, very attentive. The decor is also really nice, with some comfortable little booth seats.  Overall, I think we spent about 1.5-2 hours here, and had a good time. 

My only complaint about this place is that the amount of food you get is really really little. Even when it comes to the cheaper sides, like potatoes and tomatoes and veggies. I know Vegas is all about screwing you out of your money, but I feel here it was just too obvious. For example, the \"tomatoes\" that came with my halibut were 2 or 3 small cherry tomatoes. I would have also appreciated more of the potatoes. And of course the actually piece of halibut was pretty small. So yeah, it's pretty obvious they are holding back on the food to get you to order more. Even the lack of real bread speaks to that. Finally, the prices of course have the 20-30% \"vegas strip surcharge\", but I chose to ignore that in this review."}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting AquaKnox, we ordered the exact same items as the first time.  It has been one of our best meals on the strip.  I would still count this as a great place for a special dinner, but something was missing on our second visit (so rating 4 instead of 5 stars).  Highlights of the menu are some of the best Crab Cakes I've had, excellent Salmon and Butterscotch Bread Pudding.  The Salmon is cooked on the medium side (so if you want it more, be sure to mention something) and it's the best salmon I've ever had.  This place is huge and practically empty both times we went.  With all the show closures and turnover at Venetian this restaurant may suffer, but certainly worth a special trip even without a show.

Ordered:
Crab Cakes (w/ great spicy ketchup & slaw)
Fig & Goat Cheese Salad
Lobster Bisque
Corn Succotash
King Salmon
Butterscotch Bread Pudding 

Overall: Great seafood restaurant on the strip.  Worth a special trip.  They are a little inconsistent but worth a visit.  The pictures will speak for themselves."}
{"text":"The best shrimp and grits ever! The service and food were amazing. I will definitely be visiting every time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"As the No1DP was staying at the Palazzo he passed by this restaurant a few times on his walk around the Venetian/Palazzo area and suggested this place as a possible dinner option. As we had wine as part of a \"happy hour event\" through the conference No1DP was attending, we talked to one of the line cooks about their menu and observed their open kitchen. Out of all the places we went to happy hour, this place impressed me enough to come back for dinner, so the No1DP promptly made dinner reservations later that night.

CONCEPT/VENUE: The Venetian/Palazzo's fine dining option with an emphasis on \"global water cuisine\". Fancy schmancy way of saying upscale seafood. 

At the entrance to the restaurant there is a water-encased walk-in wine cellar. We both thought that this would be a perfect way to showcase their premium wines as the wines themselves were \"hidden in plain sight\" by the waterfalls and enticing potential customers to come inside. As we went inside No1DP wondered how much it would take to eat inside the wine cellar as there was a table that could seat two. 

No1DP and I were placed in the booth area where other couples were present. The booths provide a place to people-watch other diners in the tables while having a little area to ourselves. It was also easy for bussers and waiters to pass by without saying anything.
 
SERVICE: Overall so-so. Service was good that silverware was replaced when a new dish was about to come out and that when you left your table, your napkin was remade for you. They were also quick to refill your wine glasses. The wait time between ordering our food and when the food actually came out was at least 20 minutes, and when the food finally came they gave No1DP the wrong dish, the Pacific Blue Prawns. We took a bite out of the prawns and thought it was good until No1DP realized that he ordered halibut. It took time to make another halibut and gave him a small salad for compensation as I ate my dish. No1DP liked his salad and the dressing. 

FOOD/DRINK
Wine was a low-oak Chardonnay, which was chosen because our dishes consisted of fish with hearty sauces. 

Amuse was a very small \"tuna salad\" of sorts with a mushroom on outside. Mushroom was firm and tuna was lightly seasoned.

Appetizer was a wild blue crab cake ($18): Chayote slaw, creole remoulade sauce. Crab cake was done perfectly as the crab fell apart after slicing it. Remoulade gave the crab a bit of spice and the vegetable medley on top sweetened the dish. 

My dish was a New Zealand john dory ($45): Lobster succotash, okra, wild mushrooms, sweet corn nage, black truffle. One of AquaKnox's signature dishes. The fish was soft, buttery and could easily be separated with a fork. Sauce was also delicious and went with the dish, made the fish a little more nutty. Sauce was heavy but not too heavy in that I could finish my dish. 

No1DP's real dish was a wild Alaskan halibut ($44): Lobster mashed potatoes, broccolini, piquillo pepper relish. I'm used to softer halibut and was a little disappointed in the texture, especially since I started realizing that I prefer fish with soft textures. No1DP did enjoy his fish as he's used to this type of texture for halibut and thought the sauce was delicious as well. 

Aside from the spotty service the No1DP and I enjoyed our experience here and I would recommend this place for fine dining/seafood if you want to stay in the Venetian area for dinner."}
{"text":"Crab cakes, fresh clams on the half shell & white wine braised clams, giant prawns, tuna tartar paired with a Malbec Argentinian red wine - all child's play leading to this surf & turf lobster tail & med-rare filet mignon. I'm being treated well! The night topped off with a flourless chocolate cake plus caramel drizzle & espresso chaser. How sweet it is! Of course I didn't pay for the meal so it's easy to give the place 5 stars."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting this to be one of the best meals I had in Vegas. The food was amazing. They understand the concept of a perfect bite. I have never had scallops cooked so perfectly. The food was only matched by the service. From the moment I sat down at the table to when I finally left, it was an incredible dinner. The sommelier was able to recommend a perfect wine for the meal. Both my water and wine glasses were refilled promptly. I look forward to eating at AquaKnox again."}
{"text":"There is a lot of good fish served at Aquaknox.  I have eaten here probably 6-8 times (can't remember) and I've had many things.

Two things:
-The menu hasn't changed much in the past three years.
-Even the specials are the same (surf (filet or strip) and turf)

The food is really good here and the service is excellent.  But, really, there is one thing here that you have to get and get it no matter how many times you get it.  

Sweet shrimp & crab salad!  Let me say it again....

SWEET SHRIMP & CRAB SALAD!  

I've asked the servers what their dressing is and I couldn't quite get it out of him.  Nonetheless I'm going to try to replicate.  Its a misture of sesame oil, olive oil and a blend of citrus fruits (lime, lemon??).  

The prices aren't cheap.  That salad is 18 dollars.  Pretty high up there.  I've talked to others and some think they could charge 25-28 dollars for that salad and they would still buy it.  Most of the main courses are in the 30+ range.  Your bill can run up fast.  

Enjoy, and just get the salad.  You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Nice experience.  Very good all around, however would not say excellent.  Service was a bit slow.  We were sitting at least 10 minutes before anyone said boo to us.  Once server came, she was excellent, although still a bit slow.

Another issue I had was the menu.  We reviewed the current menu online, as we always do, however was quite disappointed to discover the online menu was not current, and many items listed online were not available.

That said, cocktails, appetizer, entrees and desserts were all excellent   We would recomnmend, and we would also return."}
{"text":"Amazing.

The appetizers were great. The wine we ordered (with help from our waiter) was amazing and complimented our meals (surf and turf) extremely well. The steak was cooked perfectly. The desserts were amazing.

The ambiance is nice, and when you first walk up it's really pretty having the wine bottles being cascaded by water.

It's pricey, but extremely worth it."}
{"text":"I would recommend the lobster and the John Dory. I always love the amuse bouche that is presented, and the different sauces that are offered with the oysters. I don't like the fact that if you bring your own bottle of champagne they put it in the back for you at all times, don't offer you a chiller for it. I was allowed a bottle of Crystal and I assumed it would be placed in a bucket of ice beside my table at the time of my meal like I have seen with the one that are placed on an ice bucket with a holder next to the table. My bottle of Crystal was kept in the back, and it pissed me off when I told the waiter you should try this vintage, it's awesome. He told me I already tried some of yours in the back. I was really pissed, but dinner was comp'd because I gamble a lot. The food is well presented and the quality is of the highest. On one occasion when I was having clams, I got a mouth full of sand and it was disgusting."}
{"text":"We had my gfs birthday dinner here before heading out to LAVO .

I ordered this whole fish and boy it was the BEST out of all the dishes we had that night. It just melted in my mouth like BUTTAH!!! It was superb that all my other friends wanted to eat more of my dish!
HEY! Its mine.....

We also ordered fresh oysters and 2 bottles of wine that I can remember.
Anyway, it was a wonderful dinner and a GREAT WAY to start our all girls night out!

Will definitely come back for the whole fish again and again.. and AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I love this bar/restaurant.  It has a supercool aqua motif, and I love the bartender here--she is my favorite!  This place has a great raw bar.  I love the oysters here, and the atomic sized prawns  I had a spicy seafood pasta with arrabiata sauce.  It was truly wonderful, spicy, but not overhwhelming.  I cannot wait to go back and visit my favorite bartender!"}
{"text":"Went here diring restaurant week.

Ordered the orawns with risotto and the steak cap with mased potatoes. The steak was so so. The prawns were phenomenal. 

They brought out a crab cake on the house.  It was so good. Lobster bisque was tasty. For dessert we had bread pudding.  The presentation was awesome. It again was awesome. 

The show stealer was absinthe. The cart they bring it out on and the whole process was cool. I would recommend this restaurant to a seafood lover or someone who is into trying new drinks."}
{"text":"If you are in Las Vegas and not dining at AquaKNOX you are missing out. Everything from the first greeting to the digestive at the end of the meal is top notch! Being from Texas I cut my teeth on beef and I have to say that the steaks here are the best I have ever eaten. Perfectly prepared and seasoned 21 day dry aged perfection. We started with king crab and I had the surf and turf while my dearest had the seabass so perfectly cooked and served with a sauce so delicate and flavorful it was heaven. The sauce complimented the fish without overpowering it as is the case so often when a mild fish is served with a sauce. The service was perfect. From the gentleman who seated us to the person who cleared our plates everyone was friendly and engaged yet not overly hovering. We wanted for nothing. The recommended wine was also perfect. A lovely Napa Pino Noir -Cherry Pie. We were stuffed by the end of the meal but could not pass on the Butterscotch Bread Pudding... OMG what a perfect desert! Tiny lemon tart and raspberry tea as a digestive at the end of the meal compliments of the chef put the finishing touch on what was the finest meal of my life. Thank you to all at AquaKNOX! We will return!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious and the service was great and hilarious. I came here with a party of 12 or so. I recommend the seafood platter app and the lobster. We noticed that every time someone would get up, the waiters would replace their napkin and fold it up all fancy. It got to the point where, just to be obnoxious, we would get up and down and up and down. I think we had almost as many waiters as people in our party."}
{"text":"Service is impeccable. Laid back and classy at the same time. Fantastic oysters from B.C.  crab legs were Huge!!  Well worth the visit"}
{"text":"if you're looking for some of the BEST seafood in Las Vegas, look no further.  From the surprisingly complex Amuse Bouche of Mushroom & Mango Ceviche and the Alaskan King Crab appetizer to the first-class service by Jesse and Tonya, the night couldn't have been better.
I grew up in Alaska, so my standards for crab are high and the chef exceeded my expectations. I had the halibut, which in other less deft hands can be overcooked, but in this case, it was perfectly seasoned and mouth-watering. My friends, both who live far, far away from oceans, had the prawns and scallops and couldn't stop saying how it was the best seafood they had enjoyed in years.
I'd highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes with thick, moist succulent chunks of lobster that doesn't overpower the potatoes.
I'd highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you can get a booth, which the manager Min made possible for us. In other restaurants it can be difficult to hear yourself think, but here at Aquaknox, you can relax, enjoy a great bottle of wine from their excellent selection, consult with a knowledgeable and helpful sommelier and celebrate the good life."}
{"text":"Ate here for the 4th time recently and had as good a meal as I can remember.  My wife had the crab stuffed lobster, highly recommend this dish.  I had the seafood soup, very, very, good.  Started with a dozen oysters which were obviously extremely fresh.  Sat at the bar as usual.  Good martinis.  I will dine here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved Aquaknox for appetizers and drinks with colleagues!  Fantastic setup with a definite ocean vibe without that stinky fish smell.  I happened to be there between 4pm and 7pm, when drinks containing Absolut vodka (among other possibilities) were buy one, get one.  So I scored two $13.00 martinis for the price of one!  Heaven!  What a steal in Las Vegas!  After the first martini, I realized I needed a snack in order to stand up without falling over.  My boyfriend and I decided to split the Seafood Trio.  Yum!  Truly this is one of the tastiest dishes I've *ever* had!  It was lump crab cake, sweet lobster and cocktail shrimp.  OMG!  It's something to dream about!  Service was great; prices were fair.  I didn't sit in the main dining area or sample from that menu."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I had a steak that was precisely, perfectly cooked to MY liking (medium) and my husbands liking (rare) perfectly - the chef Cooked it perfectly! The sashimi was fresh, the wine was served with great knowledge, and the atmosphere was welcoming and romantic. Well done."}
{"text":"AquaKnox is located inside the Venetian/Palazzo property. 

I've dined here twice- one intimate dinner, and one business dinner. This restaurant has the right seating and atmosphere for casual, romantic, and business meals. Different parts of the restaurant have different vibes and they seat you accordingly if you put in a note/request while reserving your table. Service is always super. 

Though everything I've tried here tastes amazing, there is one dish I recommend 1000% to everyone!! I just tasted it, and I literally think about this meal often and cant wait to have it again- it was that good!! 

AquaKnox Fish Soup - $53.00 (Jan 2017)
Description: Mediterranean tomato-saffron broth, pernod, maine lobster, mussels, clams, prawns, sardinian couscous.

I know it sounds like a hodge podge of all the seafood they could find... but don't worry. Its a bowl of pure amazingness served with a little crostini which was also crazy delicious. Go try it and tell me how much you love it ;)

Their drinks are also memorable. Can't wait to dine here again."}
{"text":"Excellent place for seafood!!! Wife and I came here on a last minute decision at 7:30pm. Called in for reservations just in case and they said they would be able to seat us right away. Awesome! We got a nice private booth which made it seem like it was all planned. 

Wait staff were extremely polite and attentive. Chris was our main server and he also had a back up server to help. We started with steamed clams and seared foie gras. The broth for the clams was amazing and wanted to drink it straight. Foie gras was also delicious and on point. For our main dish my wife had a half crab stuffed lobster and King crab legs, and I had the Peruvian seabass. Nothing disappointed us at all and definitely hit the spot.

This was probably our best meal of the trip for the 3 days we were there. Would highly recommend if you like seafood."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night at 7:30PM and it was almost empty. Food was delicious. I had seared tuna and two friends had lobster and surf/turf. All enjoyed it. Excellent service. Bottom line, meal was good, but very overpriced."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  I was meeting a friend of the family whom I have not seen in 42 years.  We had reservations at 530pm.  We were seated quite fast to our table and were greeted by Hillary (man) and Norman.  They waited on us like there was no tomorrow.  Since I don't eat fish.  I ordered the rib eye steak, shrimp cocktail, a glass of red wine and flourless chocolate cake.  He ordered that same, except he had crab for the appetizer. It was the first time I ever ate crab meat.   It was specatular..  I thought this restaurant was in the Palazzo; but I see here it says Venetian.   The total bill was $247.  So it is a bit pricey; but well worth it.!!! I highly recommend it. The ambience was great and it quickly filled up.  I looked up and saw the almost every table was taken.  Thank you AquaKnox.!!  Susie"}
{"text":"Not very impressed.

My family and I came to Las Vegas for my dad's 50th birthday. We originally had a dinner planned somewhere else but due to some people bailing we had to find somewhere else. A friend had recommended this restaurant. The staff was very polite and and sat us promptly. The menu was explained well and we were told of the nights specials. It wasn't until after we received our first round of drinks and appetizer that everything started to go downhill. The portion size is what I had expected and tasted really good but the service went right in the toilet. After our appetizer arrived my dad asked for a mexicana coffee. It took half an hour for that to arrive and nobody came back in between that time to ask anyone if they wanted drinks. When the waiter finally came back with the mexicana coffee he placed it in front of me,  not my dad. 15 minutes later we flagged him down to place another drink order. I asked for a mohito and my aunt asked for wine. The waiter took orders from half the table and took off without asking anyone else. He came back with two sangrias to which we told him we never ordered. The other end of the table never got a chance to order and actually had to walk across the hall to another store to get some wine and my mohito never showed up. Myself, my dad and my cousin's steak was not cooked how we asked for it. My cousin asked for well done to which he received charbroiled outside and red inside. I asked for medium rare and got rare. My dad asked for medium and got medium rare to rare. Throughout the night we had 4 different waiters serve us. Our collective overall experience was not good. I will not go here again nor will I recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"I've been coming to a convention here twice a year for at least 15 years and this is my first time eating at AquaKnox. I took a customer here for dinner and it was top notch all the way. Our server was Zack and he did an amazing job explaining the menu, making suggestions and just making sure we were well taken care of.

We started with the 1 pound appetizer of king crab legs- warm with drawn butter. They were delicious albeit a bit pricey at $72.  I had the scallops which were perfectly prepared served over creamed corn and a cauliflower pur√©e. My client had filet mignon which she said was delicious.

We skipped dessert but we were brought a complementary amuse bouche of tuna (prior to our meal) and then a nice after dinner tasting of a pistachio tasting cocktail and a tiny pistachio flavored layer cake with custard.

Very pricy, classy place.  If you've got a client or date to impress, come to AquaKnox but be prepared to drop about $150 per person with a bottle of wine or about $100 without."}
{"text":"Diane and I very recently enjoyed a very nice first dinner at AquaKnox.  The atmosphere here is modern and refined; service was very good; and the food sublime.  We also found the waitstaff and kitchen to be very accommodating to special requests.  In our case French Fries were substituted for Butternut Puree, Mushroom, and Brussels Sprouts.  

For another starter following on the heels of a tasty amuse bouche of Chicken Salad with Piquillo Peppers on Focaccia, Pacific Prawns with horseradish-based Atomic Cocktail Sauce served on the side packed a cold, meaty, and spicy payload.  And a difficult to find King Crab Louie salad with shaved vegetables, Heirloom Tomatoes, Baby Iceberg Heart, and Green Goddess Dressing added to the cool gustatory vibe before the mains were brought to our table.  

Then we dined on excellent moist Roasted Welsh Seabass with Fingerling Potatoes and squash, and large New Bedford Scallops with hand-cut Kennebuck Fries.  Although we didn't order any dessert, we were each treated to a sweet Chocolate Hazelnut confection at meal's end.  

This is a place that takes pleasing its diners seriously.  Our server was solicitous of our needs, and I observed well-focused chefs working frenetically in the kitchen to quickly and correctly complete orders.   

For me, when craving fine fish, a return trip is quite likely!"}
{"text":"I attended a work function here with 9 people in a semi private room.  The room was perfect!  Service was splendid!  We had a waiter and an assistant so pretty quick service.

I highly recommend the Alaskan King Crab Legs and the Surf n Turf with the ribeye!!

Quite a few of the steaks had to be returned due to being very undercooked but other then that, it was amazing!!  No complaints from me!

Everyone raves about the Lobster Bisque - it was good but not as good as the Crab Bisque from Tommy Bahamas."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Filet mignon was great! Crab cakes were hearty, large amounts of king crab. Fav was lobster bisque soup! Vegans must try! Anniversary dinner, created nicely and champagne to start! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"This place deserves all five stars!  I'd call it a fresh water experience.  Wear your nice clothes here because this place deserves it!    They'll start with an Amuse bouche, then tasty bread sticks with salmon mousse - fabulous flavor.   Seafood appetizer (shrimp/crab/lobster) delicious! 
Calamari salad - friscee with a light panko calamari and dressing that was like a cake topper!
Chicken - I know at a place that does fish right -  but they know their chicken.  Hands down one of the best chicken dishes.  Crispy outside and juicy inside sitting on an artichoke/potato mash and a lemon butter sauce that I'm still dreaming about.
Scallops - cooked perfectly!
Salmon with the bacon, chard and chive sauce you will not be disappointed.
Roasted asparagus was a nice touch.  
Chocolate cake perfect ending -- except then they brought us carrot cake.  Frosting tasted like butter, only better.   
Service was exceptional.
Located in the Venetian Hotel.  A calming atmosphere and a place where you can actually talk and listen without over powering music.   If you have a party of 6 or under, try to reserve the circular wine room.  A good time to be had by all!"}
{"text":"Seriously good food and great service. Top-notch.

I was here for LV restaurant week with a large dinner party, and what impressed us the most about our experience here was the service and excellent timing of everything. We were here for a leisurely and elegant meal, which we definitely received. The servers were accommodating, friendly and knowledgable!

I ordered the prix-fix 3-course meal which included:
1. Little Bite - Fried Risotto (tiny and crispy, but lite on the flavor)
2. Appetizer - Peach Caprese (delicious with a great blend of flavors...if only there was a little more avocado!)
3. Palate cleanser - Oyster! Free! (while I don't like oysters, the fact that it came with the meal was a pleasant surprise!)
4. Main - Prime Rib Cap Steak (cooked well, yummy onion rings, not the best steak ever, but well prepared)
5. Dessert - Belgium Choc Smores (MEHHHH, I was not a fan, but many of my fellow diners loved it)

Overall, I was impressed with the food, decor, and above all else, the service."}
{"text":"If you're walking in for just drinks you should know that they're good but really overpriced! Especially the water ($7.5 for a bottle!)
The service was ok, although it took the waiter a long time to bring us the check."}
{"text":"I can't resist good seafood. No matter the price. 

I have to give 5 stars for the ambience in this place. I just like the cool vibe and layout of the restaurant. The food gets a 3 1/2. Not the best seafood I've ever had, but still pretty good, despite the high pricetag.

Our service was good and I really enjoyed the bread. I'm a sucker for carbs. If you get that right, I'm halfway to being sold on your restaurant.

Definitely interested giving this place another try."}
{"text":"i've eaten here a few times but never remember to review it... it's good, nothing like blow your mind good, but good.

lobster bisque nice and creamy i think it is a tad undersalted tho. 

mixed green salad with champagne vinaigrette. nice and light.  mmmm.. yum

grilled brie and tomato sandwich yummy however paired with the fries it gets a little too greasy of a meal

steak and lobster also a yum.

seafood tower thingy sooo tasty. the food is fresh"}
{"text":"5 course dinner with wine paring for my birthday? Umm, yes please!

My birthday dinner here was wonderful and I left wonderfully full.  The service here was excellent.  Everyone who came to our table, be it to clear a dish or place a new one, greeted us with eye contact and ensured we enjoyed ourselves.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable and took time to explain aspects about the wine to us when we were unsure.

Some standouts from out from dinner were: 
-the oyster shooter, alcohol? yes. oysters? yes. together? double yes.
-heirloom tomato panzanella, it was drenched in vinaigretty (is that a word?) deliciousness
-seared yellow fin tuna, the fennel pollen gave it a nice earthy taste while to balance the subtle fishiness
-John Dory, just wonderful, it had a beautiful golden sear on the outside that tastes as wonderful as it looked

They have fresh seafood flown in daily.  The John Dory is their signature fish and it didn't disappoint.  It was a wonderful, elegant, seafood experience, albeit pricey.

Date night seal of approval!"}
