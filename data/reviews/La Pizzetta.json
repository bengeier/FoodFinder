{"text":"New Chef rocks! The salads are amazing in addition to the pasta and pizza. Wine selection very diverse. Service is very friendly too. We've made this a weekly tradition. If you've been here before this new chef ... you need to come back."}
{"text":"Well... I finally checked out La Pizzetta. at McDowell Mountain Ranch.   The Pizza was good... but, not that good!  $20.00 for a very thin crust 12\" pizza with very \"skimpy ingredients\".  So \"skimpy\" that I felt 'ripped off' and, won't go back.  Too bad... that it wasn't awesome for $20.00. because we like to eat pizza (once a week) and this place is walking distance from where I live. _______Custom PIZZA made at Basha's is a better pizza and a better value!!  Larger with 'more  ingredients'  for maybe $15.00 max.   _______I don't see how La Pizzetta. will make it at MMR. and it's their own fault.  Too bad:(("}
{"text":"Great salad, big enough to split. Pizzas were delicious, great crust and a lot of cheese."}
{"text":"Love their new menu with more options besides the pizza.  I had their Eggplant Parmesan which was outstanding.  A friend had Pappardelle Bolognese and said that was excellent and my husband had their lasagna and really liked it.  The serving sizes are generous and, I love the intimate atmosphere.  I'm thrilled to have them in McDowell Mountain Ranch."}
{"text":"This place is quaint and small, serving European style pizzas.  Simple menu with great pizzas and salads.  This a family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is associated with owners of Classic Cooking Academy which is located next door and access thru door separating restaurant and cooking school.  A limited menu and wine list. Had Margherita pizza which was good. Ordered second one but asked it be chrispy.  Someone made chicken soup next door and the entire restaurant reeked with this smell.  Not very appetizing eating pizza.  Server said she would tell them in the future  to make when restaurant was closed.  Second pizza was burnt apparently as we had to wait for a re-do.  Chef offered us dessert but we declined gesture. Used Groupon. Hope they make it."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time on Friday evening. Great atmosphere, love that you can see the pizza oven from the table.Best pizza I have eaten since moving to the US. If you like authentic Italian pizza this is the place. Looking forward to going back to try some different dishes."}
{"text":"I was reading the reviews for La Pizzetta and just had to add my thoughts. I've tried a few pizza places but I can't get enough of La Pizzetta's Margherita pizza. I consider this to be more like a boutique style pizza place. Their pies are very thin and very light which is what I think makes this fantastic pie so good. I recently tried POMO pizza because someone recommended it as having a great wood fired pizza. I couldn't eat it. It was too cheesy, too heavy and too salty - not for me.  I can't comment on the rest of the food at this point because I can't seem to imagine eating anything but their pizza. As for the atmosphere - it can use some work. Just know that when you do decide to try it that you're going for the food.   FYI - we often order 2 pies to go and I have a tip for those that also take out ... we noticed that they would stack the pizza boxes on top of one another causing the bottom pie to hold in too much heat which resulted in a mushy crust. Easily corrected - when we order we request that they don't stack the boxes on top of one another and haven't had a problem since."}
{"text":"Great pizza and a great staff as well. Very attentive to your needs and an Italian chef who cares about what he serves. He came out to our table just to be sure. The seating area is small but cozy, so don't be surprised! Thanks to the staff for being so attentive and friendly. See you again."}
{"text":"After hearing from two sources that the pizza was good we decided to give it a try. We were pleased. Pizza was delicious we had a four cheese and a sausage. Both were very enjoyable. A nice salad started us off and we were too full for dessert. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, ordered the calamari. It was heavenly - the tomato garlic sauce they served the calamari with was warm and to die for! Then we ordered the carbonara pizza - another masterpiece. To finish it off we ordered the tiramisu - felt like all the delights of Italy were dancing in my mouth :) The place, the good service and the friendly chef all get an A+!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, charming atmosphere, will definitely be going back. Loved the little surprise from the chef ... as soon as you are seated, the servers treat everyone to a nice taste of homemade biscotti and olives.  A wonderful surprise instead of bread and butter. The broccolini was grilled perfectly with a touch of balsamic. The walnut pizza was delicious. I wish I had saved room for the yummy desserts. I love that Classic Cooking shares their passion with us -- delicious gourmet food, low key, casual, yet elegant and charming.  A Real Treasure.  I look forward to going back soon. Definitely recommend La Pizzetta!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always great! I recommend any of the pizzas, because it's their specialty. Always cooked when ordered, and they come fresh out of a wood fired brick oven. Their pizzas are thin crust, and very crispy. It's all fresh ingredients! I am never disappointed!!! The service is absolutely great, always there when to get you anything you need!"}
{"text":"We happened to luck into finding this wonderful restaurant.  The food was incredibly fresh, delicious and very shareable amongst all our friends.  Pietro, the owner, was amazing. He visited all of the tables and made us feel like family.  Will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Really good gourmet pizza and grilled Brussel sprouts are tasty too. Attentive staff to boot!  Give it a try you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. The food is exceptional and always well seasoned. We come every week and will keep coming, the Chef is always accommodating and makes my sons pasta to perfection."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried La Pizzetta for the first time last weekend.  We ordered a Margherita and an Americano pizza to-go...both delicious!  Fresh and tasty ingredients, have not had pizza this good in a long time.  We will definitely be returning to this hidden gem as the staff were very friendly and attentive to us while we waited and the atmosphere was very relaxing and inviting.  Chef Pizzurro even came out to meet us. This restaurant is a must try!"}
{"text":"The pizzoki is one of the best I've had. It's worth stopping in just for it - the chocolate was quality.  We were told the chef is new and the menu has changed since we were in last.  The prices have gone up a little,  but we were able to share a salad and pizza and be full.  Service was excellent.   The free bread was slightly undercooked,  buy hey, it's free and they offered additional.  Pizza is authentic ,  light sauce, thin crust and flavorful.  We live nearby and will be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our dinner . Ordered two carry out pizzas last night waited an extra half hour then got home with two burned pizzas on the bottom but cold on top. They were not edible , would like my money back. If they were having a problem should have explained to us apologized and offered a different option ."}
{"text":"I believe they are trying to start something which may take off after they get situated.   The sign on the door said they opened at one o'clock and the door was locked.  We went back at two and they were open.   When we asked to order one of the appetizers we were told the waiter would \"have to see if the kitchen was ready\".  See if the kitchen was ready?  They were to have opened an hour ago!   The Brussel sprouts were something we would not order again. Nothing special and actually, were tough. The pizzas were \"okay\", nothing special.  Neither pizza was cooked properly. One pizza was very undercooked, which we took home in a \"to go\" box so we could heat up on a skillet at home to crisp up the crust and ensure the toppings were cooked. The second pizza had a nice brown crust one side of the pizza, but the opposite side of the pizza was not cooked.  It was real soggy.  Apparently, the chef did not rotate the pizza in the pizza oven half-way in-between cooking so both sides of the pizza eventually received the heat. Neither pizzas cheese had melted.  CHEF - pay attention - the pizzas were not cooked properly!!! I imagine had the pizzas been cooked properly in a nice hot oven the crusts may have been nice, but we will never know.   The decor is very confusing.  It looks like a pull up take-out pizza counter, yet you can sit and order and eat in. The waiter tried to make our experience a good one, but we felt as if he was working with an incompetent kitchen.  Bottom Line - inconsistent, flavors were flat, decor is confusing, chairs are not comfortable."}
{"text":"Awful...prior review nailed it. It was like dining in a make shift comedy tv set ready to prank somebody. People DID keep coming thru the door next door....a cooking school.  Pizza's are only offered as 10\".  Both of ours resembled cheese on burned soup...you could see thru the bottom crust, IF you could call it a crust.  On the other hand, the sausage was great and so was the soda. Odd that you can ONLY have carmelized onions on your pizza...never seen those in the produce section"}
{"text":"We tried La Pizzetta with very high hopes but unfortunately left very disappointed. When we arrived we were met very nicely by one of the waitstaff and sat immediately. I have to say that all of the staff were very nice, so no issues with the staff or the service. The restaurant is quite small and it was pretty full when we got there. Shortly after we sat the main table left and the restaurant was pretty calm. For some reason it took over an hour to get our food. We ordered three pizzas and one pasta dish, nothing that should take so long. I was not bothered by the wait though as we like to sit and talk, never being in a rush to eat.  Also, the staff realized that something was not right and offered us some warm bread and oil as a result of the delay. Once the food came we were happy to finally eat. I ordered a pasta dish and to be honest it was quite good and I would eat it again. However, my wife and kids did not like the pizzas at all. My daughter had a simple Margherita pizza, but it was soggy and under cooked on the bottom.She ate two pieces and left the rest. I tried it as well and did not even finish one piece. My son had a pepperoni pizza which had almost no pepperoni to speak of, and he said the taste was just not very good. This one was well cooked, not soggy, but the flavors were not authentic. My wife had a pizza as well, with vegetables and some meats, she finished most of it but said she would not go back. Keep in mind that we are a very diverse pizza family. We do not eat garbage pizza like Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa John's...we only eat traditional NY style pizza as well as Neapolitan style, traditional style from Italy.  We hunt all over the valley for good pizza, and we travel all over the world as a family and search out great pizza wherever we go. We also make our own pizza in home with 100% authentic ingredients from the flour to the San Marzano tomatoes, so we know good pizza. Unfortunately this restaurant did not make the grade for us and we will not be returning or recommending this place to any of our friends. It is sad as they have a nice convenient location and good pizza of any sort would be welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and our server (Phil) was attentive and knew his menu.  We ordered the grilled eggplant with goat cheese and a perfectly tasting pizza and it was delicious and had  the Block Nine Pinot wine and all was perfect.  We will definitely be back.  So happy to have this wonderful little restaurant right in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nice addition to MMR.  We had the Michelangelo and the fennel sausage pizza.  They were both very good and this place has good wine selection.  Could use a broader beer selection for my taste...but that's not what they are going for.  They are obviously just getting going, so there are some imperfections in service and ambience (what's with all the lanterns?).  Like the farm table - it would be cool to have more tables like it.  In response to previous review - don't judge wood fired pizza if you are taking it to go.  It's best right out of the fire."}
{"text":"New chef with new menu....delicious, authentic Italian pastas, salads and pizza. Dessert had several different types of  high quality chocolate in the cookie and we gobbled it up. Service was top notch. Chef visited with us and was very friendly and excited to be there. He's actually from Italy so we can't wait to come back and try more dishes. Reminds us of our trips to Italy with all those flavors that are hard to find here."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and food all around, wish they would expand to Peoria! The service and atmosphere is excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and desert. The service was very friendly. We did their salad, 2 pizzas, wine and desert special for a fixed price. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I have been a selfish yelp user. I have only used it to find restaurants in the past. I have been shy to post any reviews until my most recent experience here at this venue. To start off, the ambience is not good. I was a little in shock when I first arrived. Truly looks like a dive. I wish I could say the ambiance got better but as the night went on I realized there is a cooking class attached to this restaurant and they come into the dining room to grab various items of food ALL THE TIME from the fridge, which happens to be located in the middle of the dining room....very strange. The pizza isn't bad but with all the choices available around the valley, I would rather spend my money somewhere else. It is not a good place for families...there is no kids menu, there are no kids cups, there is only one hi-chair available for the entire restaurant. The worst part about the venue I would say is when I learned at the end after receiving our bill that they charged us for refills on Iced tea. If you're going to charge for a refill I think it's fair to state you're going to charge a refill before you just give a refill. In addition, the size of the drink is so small it's almost impossible not to get at least one refill. This place will not get my repeat business and I wanted to make sure others were aware to save them from this headache."}
{"text":"tried new menu and new chef!  They have added pasta and larger pizzas.  The food was great!  I had chicken Marsala and my husband had chicken piccata.  Both yummy.  Bread comes baked with oil and balsamic vinaigrette.  So good!  New chef is very nice. He's very experienced.  Definitely recommend and will go again."}
{"text":"Me and a friend stopped by there last night and was very happy with the food, service and wine!  They were prompt and friendly.  The food was delicious, and we took advantage of a deal where you could share a salad, get your own 10 inch pizza, a glass of wine each and share a dessert for like 33$!  It was a cute, quiet environment with great food and service.  You should definitely try it out.  Great for date night."}
{"text":"My cousin came in from Chicago with her husband and his brother and sister and their spouses.  Bub was cranky when he got there cuz we walked so far to get there and seemed crestfallen when he learned they don't have miller lite or deep dish pies !    But they won us over real quick with great Italian music ... They have a great staff and delicious pizzas and ice cold beers ... Nice atmosphere its an intimate small place we had a great time will definitely return"}
{"text":"A very nice little pizza restaurant where it was badly needed! Appetizers are delicious and pizza is thin crust and very good. Good wine selection"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I called in for a to go order, one pepperoni, cheese and mushroom ( I had to create my own since they didn't have this option WTF) and a cheese pizza which was gluten free.   The restaurant was hideous and you can see right through the kitchen. When the kind older lady took my order, she gave it to the tall pizza chef. The moment he heard gluten free he threw the biggest fit! I mean shut the hell up kid and do your job! I was furious. I was so tempted to leave but my boyfriend really wanted to try this place so I waited. Somehow I waited about 20 even after I called it in about 10 min prior to walking in. What upset me more was waiting all that time when I tried to avoid that by calling in the order! As soon as I get the pizza and get home the pizza was cold!!! I live literally  5 minutes from there. The pizza was salty and bread was under cooked. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"So they just started happy hour everyday from 4-6pm. Amazing! You guys have to try and they're house wine is fantastic.. And I'm a wine snob"}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experieces ever. Burnt pizza. Food was cold. No one offerd to replace the burnt pizza. Even the ice tea was terrible (and expensive). I would not recommend wasting your money on this place."}
{"text":"Pizza was bland.  Would not recommend. We did carry out and ordered two pizzas, one was margarita with pepperoni and the other was Palermo. I encourage the ownership to season their food."}
{"text":"Caprese was very good but unusual from what you may be used to. Had pesto on it, which I personally love, but no balsamic. Wine was reasonably priced and yummy. Fire roasted Brussel sprouts fell flat. Egg was unnecessary and a little overcooked - it wasn't runny which is usually the point of adding the egg. I wanted to add salt for flavor. Margherita pizza with prosciutto was very good - slightly sweet sauce, pretty cheesy, phenomenal crust. Service was great. The ambiance was small and casual. They tried to make it low lighting for more intimacy, but there's not much money put into the ambiance. Waiter said new chef is straight from Sicily, and you could tell from the pizza but that's definitely their focus - brick oven pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was good enough to call in a to go order but customer service and restaurant atmosphere are lacking. They made a mistake on my husbands order so he had to wait 20 montes after my meal was brought out to get his. They did give us cannoli for their error. Not sure the restaurant  will last. Not an appealing enough atmosphere. We were never seated or greeted."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and were super excited to try this place.  Ordered three pizzas for six people since they are 10-inch pizzas.  We also ordered them to-go.  The Michaelango was good, but the other two weren't so much.  The four cheese which we got for our kids didn't taste like four cheeses it only tasted like Parmesan cheese which had a really strong bitter taste to it.  The other pizza was the walnut one which was just ok.  To be fair, we did set our oven to warm and kept them warm for about 30 minutes before eating, but I don't think it should have changed the flavors.  Want to give it another try."}
{"text":"Cute place, close to home. I really enjoyed the pizza and will check out the cooking classes next door!"}
{"text":"I feel badly writing this review as I think they are trying to get their act together but we had a pretty miserable experience. Called for takeout- they told me it would be ready in 20 minutes. Arrived 25 minutes later (even waited that extra 5 just to have it be ready).  Needless to say 40 minutes AFTER that we left with our food. The place was weird inside. People were confused as to what they should be doing and yelling at each other in the kitchen.  We should've left then. The guy answering phone was clueless. He told me \"we don't make it til you get here so it's fresh.\" Huh?  You told me 20 minutes on the phone?   They had a half price pizza deal in October so we ordered 4 pizzas. I asked on phone what size they were and was told 12 inches. These were definitely NOT 12 inch pizzas but maybe 10 inches. The prosciutto was inedible and had to be removed. Everything else was pretty salty and the only pizza that was passable was margarita. But the weirdest part was one of the pizzas had been sliced across the top- like half of a slice was sliced off. What happened? Was it dropped? Who knew?  I called and the clueless guy answering phone was snippy and told me they were running behind and on and on. He didn't know what happened to my pizza (didn't believe me?) so I offered to text a pic and he said fine.  He called back and admitted a piece of the pizza burned bc it got one of the coals on it so they lopped it off. Wow. How professional. If he would've just told me when it happened what happened and then offered to remove from bill etc I would've been more sympathetic. But he was rude and snarky. So I said obviously you don't care about building your business again bc you've just lost some customers.  Now to be fair he did call back and apologize and offer us a pizza and bottle of wine on the house next time.  The thing is, even with free pizza and wine I doubt we'd be back....and that says a lot."}
{"text":"At the owner's request, we gave LP another shot and were very pleased we did.  We had two pizzas, the Michelangelo and Messina, both were hot, heavy with cheese and the perfect amount of sauce. We got them to go so I can't comment on the service, but the quality of the food was great and the server handling our order was very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"This is just sort of a bizarre little place.  First, the ambiance. The dining room is tiny and the furniture is mismatched. Figure, maybe ten tables or so. Strangely, their walk in refrigerator is located *in* the actual dining room, so you'll see staff running back and forth grabbing things out it while you're eating. Odd. I ordered a beer. It was actually a canned beer and the waiter proceeded to pour it into one of those little six ounce glasses you typically find in a dorm cafeteria. Not what I expected for $6 or $7. My better half also noticed the silverware appeared to be from Ikea. Lol, five star dining, this isn't.  The food. We ordered two pizzas and they were decent. Not outstanding, just solidly average. You'd better be sure you like cheese because they're going to give you a ton of it. Most of the pizzas are in the $10 range and they're fairly small pizzas, so it's a not great deal for what you pay for it. We had two of them and were still hungry. I did notice that the bottoms of the pizzas were burnt and had an ashy taste to them. I'm not sure if maybe the cooking surface was dirty, or what, but it detracted from the quality of the pizza with an ashtray like after taste.  The staff. They were halfway decent. Our waiter was working hard, but seemed to be a bit overwhelmed despite only having two tables. The head chef came around to visit the tables and seemed like he genuinely cared. Overall, I can't fault them here.  So, yeah. There you have it. The restaurant just doesn't have a finished, professional shine to it. Things feel haphazard and sloppy. Some of the other reviews mentioned they thought it might be part of the adjacent cooking school. Given what I had seen, and the weird door they have in the dining room that presumably goes to the next door cooking school, it makes sense. We bought a group on for this place to give it a try. I wish we hadn't. Some of this stuff is forgivable for the right price, but this place isn't cheap.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in town. On par with Pizzeria Bianco.  They are really friendly. Good quality ingredients and the crust is the best."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood spot.  We had the Caesar salad and roasted Brussels sprouts which were both great and amply sized.  The pizzas were as good as you can find in Italy.  A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We pulled up and questioned the decor and were a bit confused if it was a dining or takeout restaurant.   I can say that after bringing my family here and after the La Pizzetta's \"new chef\" came out and met us, we were intrigued.  We ordered mussels and several recommended main dishes.  Without a doubt it was all some of the best Italian I have experienced globally.    The wait staff was very friendly and attentive.   I truly would recommend this place and I hope they will work on their ambiance as much as they have with their quality food."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fabulous dinner tonight at La Pizzetta. Everything was Perfect from the services to the dessert. Our server brought complimentary mild green peepers infused with balsamic vinaigrette and asiago cheese. It was delicious and we wanted more.  We ordered the grilled eggplant and a Margarita pizza and both were absolutely scrumptious. The eggplant was stuffed with grilled red peppers, spinach and goat cheese and was heavenly. The pizza was prepared and baked in a brick oven to Perfection. The Scottsdale Blonde Ale was wonderful and paired well with dinner. We going back next week with family.  Linda and Ron"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Its small and local so please go and support them!  The new chef and new menu are outstanding.  The chef is from Italy and he makes everything homemade and to order.  He truly cares about the food and personally came to the table to make sure things were as we ordered.    They recently installed a new pizza oven and the pies are the best i've had.  The pasta is fresh and light- it reminded me of how the food was when I was in Italy.  There are only 6 or 7 tables and the outside is easy to miss.    If you like Italian food- go here for the food. Its not a hip \"trendy scottsdale\" spot, there is wine and beer but there is no bar.  Its a quiet place for some amazing food.  Help fight the big chains and the corporate food and enjoy Chef Pietro.  Hes also a huge Steelers fan so if you are too, let him know- he loves to talk some Football."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night, the place is packed but service is too slow because they only have 2 people running around to wait on all the tables - really need to have more servers so people don't have to wait long."}
{"text":"First time for the two of us at La Pizzetta,  a small place with perhaps a dozen tables of which we learned via a Groupon.  Excellent long strips of freshly baked bread were brought to table before we ordered; the bread was seasoned, nicely sprinkled with cheese and accompanied by a dish of emulsified olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Best chicken parmigiana I've had in years, with the cutlet properly pounded thin!  Spaghetti was al dente with tasty red sauce that was full bodied and not watery.  There is reasonably priced wine by the glass, and by the way, the entrees are also reasonably priced.  Service is attentive, decor is pleasant and owner Pietro makes it a point to visit each table and insure that the customer is happy.  La Pizzetta is an excellent find!"}
{"text":"This place is possibly the worst dining experience my family and I have ever had. This is a case of: if it looks like a disaster, it will be a disaster.   I saw them listed for Arizona Restaurant Week and they had one of the best deals - for $33 per couple you could share 1 appetizer, get 2 pizzas and share 1 dessert. Plus it included 2 beverages - wine, beer or soda. So I convinced my family we should check it out. We had 5 adults, 1 toddler and 1 baby.   I called to make a reservation and got us in. We got there and it was in a strip mall and had its two front doors wide open. You could see into the dining room (very small - maybe 10 tables - all different sizes with mismatched chairs and some were even ottomans!) and people were waiting outside.   2 young men were running around looking totally overwhelmed and I wasn't greeted for ten minutes as there was no notable host stand or procedure.   The rest of my party arrived and we surveyed the situation discussing whether to leave or try it and decided to try it - BIG mistake.  We were seated and left there for 20 minutes - no one greeting us or bringing us waters. Our toddler was getting thirsty so we were again debating whether to just get up and leave. Just then a 3rd young man asked if we were being helped and we said no! They apologized and brought us water and menus.   When our waiter finally came to take our order, we asked what wines were included in the deal - he pointed out a Chardonnay and Merlot. Then he said there was one other white wine included but was not on the menu. We asked what kind - he said \"just a white - like a Chardonnay.\" We pressed further and he said it was a Pinot Grigio so my sister and I ordered that. Lol.   Now it was not just annoying but comical. We came to realize the place was next to a cooking school and every few minutes someone new (obviously with the school/restaurant) would come thru a door in the adjoining wall - carrying supplies, carrots and one point even a bucket and toilet plunger (gross!).   If the restaurant was a cooking school restaurant, run by students of the school, it should be apparent on the website and you would know what you were getting into in the first place. This is not advertised as such anywhere.  But that's the only thing that makes sense to explain the horrible service and food.   We ordered 2 appetizers- the brocolini with burrata and roasted cauliflower. Both were served luke warm, if not cold and were not good.  For pizzas we ordered 5: 2 sausages, 1 pepperoni/mushroom/onion, 1 margarita, and 1 walnut.  They were decent - good flavors. I wanted salt and pepper but no one came by for me to ask for it and we could not get their attention until I was done!  But they were the smallest individual pizzas I've seen. They were about 10-11 inches where most are closer to 16\".   By that time we tried to wave down anyone to put in our dessert order and get our check. To make it easy we ordered 2 of the Nutella banana crepes.   Literally 20 minutes later (1 hr 40 minutes since we sat down, mind you) we were about to cancel the order and leave when they said there were just putting them on?! What?! We placed the order 20 minutes ago?!  And they are crepes!  10 minutes later they came out - the smallest underwhelming plate ever - two little roll-ups with some sauce drizzled over and a sprig of mint. But I thought they still may be good - most portions today are too big anyways - but no. They were cold (nothing about them was even warm), with very little bananas or Nutella. We left most of it on the plates.  We finally got out of there 2 hours from when we sat down! Will never go there again....  I would have given no stars if I could.   Pretty much the most horrible dining experience of my life."}
{"text":"Great experience!  We stopped by last night for dinner right when they were closing.  Instead of turning us away, they invited us in for dinner.  We got to sample one of the new pasta dishes that Chef Pietro whipped up for us- very tasty.  The wait staff was attentive.  The pizzas, reasonably priced wine, and Brussels sprouts complemented each other well.  We look forward to trying new dishes on their expanding menu."}
{"text":"We are so glad we tried this little cafe since its grand reopening.  The new menu is a huge upgrade.   The menu is full with all the Italian classics and pizza. The wine list was reasonably priced.  I tried the basics: marinara and meatballs were tasty-a nice crusty bread would be a good addition.  The Bolognese sauce was rich, meaty, with peas and fresh shaved cheese, and nice red wine undertone.   Eggplant Parmesan was tasty and served with a large side of pasta.   All the pastas and sauces are freshly made and the ones we had well executed.   The waitstaff was young but friendly.  The room is small, and more so a corner of the highly regarded Classic Cooking School, rather than its own defined space as of now.  Really really wish there were an outdoor patio.  We definitely will return to try the rest of the menu.    Really hope everyone will give it a try.  The food is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Super inconsistent. We've had great pizza from here & terrible pizza from here. Sometimes the crust is crispy & delicious - other times it is over-salted or, as it was tonight, raw in the middle and burnt on the edges. Limited menu of gourmet pizzas, a few appetizers, salads and desserts. This place seems to be run by a bunch of teenage/20-something guys who maybe take classes at the attached cooking school. They're polite, but don't seem to know what they're doing. Get your pizza to go since the decor is meh at best. If you're going to eat-in, get a bottle of wine instead of a glass because the pours are not generous. I will give them one more try and hope that tonight was a horrible anomaly."}
{"text":"Good authentic Italian.  The unassuming decor, the on point background music and the \"for real\" Italian food made this Jersey girl feel nostalgic.  Try it!"}
