{"text":"Pho mi is so far the best Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. I'm not a huge pho fan, but their pho makes me crave it sometimes! No matter what noodle soup you order, it'll be full of taste with lots of ingredients. You'll leave feeling very full and satisfied for sure. Prices are also reasonable. Restaurant isn't fancy at all and service isn't extremely friendly too, but the food is what makes me come back!  The broth in the pho is very flavourful, but I find that the \"specialty noodles\" are the best! Recently tried the chicken curry noodles and it was so good! Doesn't taste too heavy at all!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for about 6 years now ...  I only get pho , the shrimp rolls both with no meat and durian shake it's the best !!  Can't say the same about the ladies that work there they look soo miserable and bothered all the time . The place isn't very clean as well .. Now I just order to go"}
{"text":"Food is good but not worth going for because service is terrible. Just plain mean servers. Was told once for not tipping \"to go home and cook, instead of coming to dine in\". She made it clear so I no longer buy from here. If customer service improved, food would be a whole lot better too! :/"}
{"text":"This was one of those cold, dreary and windy night when one craves for a hot, steaming bowl of Pho! We searched for a nearby Vietnamese restaurant. This place sprung up that was close by.  I am very disappointed with the food and the customer service of this place. The lady at the front desk treated us as if she was giving us the food for free. The flavor of the soup was nothing to write home about. We have tried numerous Pho restaurant and this was the worst in Toronto. Enough said.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I often come here with my colleagues for lunch.   # There are plenty of places to sit # Minimum decor, but clean # Waiters are fast # Menu has numerous vietnamese options including both veg/non veg # Food is great. Freshly made.  # The place is a bit loud during peak hours"}
{"text":"Clean and good food. But no as good as the location on Wilson. Although I've been to this location multiple times, 3 stars must be given. After going and receiving sour pho, broth which could've been due to being leftover from the day before, we went back a few times to give it extra chances. Although most visits have gone without fail, there are the occasional slipups. All in all, could be said that they have the best Vietnamese dishes in the area."}
{"text":"Best place in the GTA for Vietnamese food. Pho dac biet is definitely a staple for when you don't know what to get. Everything ranging from bun cha gio to bun no hue is great. One of my go to places for Vietnamese food! It'll be hard to find a similar Vietnamese restaurant after visiting Pho Mi Asia."}
{"text":"The staff here cannot comprehend English. We wanted to sit on the outside of a 6 person table instead of the inside as it was tight and crowded. She said no, and then proceeds to sit another couple on the outside. Poor customer service..."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant last Friday.  We ordered one medium size beef pho, and one large size beef tendon pho, and one vermicelli. The medium pho came first, but we waited a long time for the tendon pho and vermicelli ( a very very long wait,  two tables that came after us got their food served before us. )  When we checked with the waitress, it seemed that the chef might have forgotten our orders. The food was okay, as many other Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto.  However, when the bill came ( and only a total number including tax on the bill, no breakdown for each item ), we felt the number was not right. So we grabbed the menu from a neighbouring table and used the calculator to check the number and it turned out they overcharged about $2.  It's not a big money, but I still went to the cashier and asked. The lady there said that the medium beef pho ($7) was actually a large size ($8).  I argued that we ordered medium size, not large size. She said that when the chef cooked the beef pho, he put all the food left in the pot into our bowl, so medium became large, and because we ate it, we must pay for the large bowl. I was astonished by her argument. So the restaurant served the wrong bowl size and force the customer to pay for it?!  I said that I didn't know it was a large size, and I never wanted a large size, because I could not even finish a medium size..  But the lady just insisted that because that was a large bowl you must pay for a large bowl. :-( And guess what, even with the large beef pho in the bill, they still overcharged about 50 cents or something.    I am very unhappy with the experience in Pho Mi Asia and I will never go back there.   PS: I deeply doubt that they might not wash the basil leaves at all, because I found a piece of dirt  on the leaf."}
{"text":"Recommended to me by my Viet friend as her favorite place. I couldn't disagree. When you visit the place is packed with Vietnamese families so you know the food is authentic. The pho itself is flavorful and they give you generous portions with lots of veggies. Prices are cheap too.  Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambience: 2 Overall: 4 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"My best friend who is from Vietnam and who is no slouch at cooking swears by this place and I couldn't agree more.    It is a typical Vietnamese restaurant, nothing fancy nor shiny and new looking but where they lack in decor and polish they more than make up for in quality of food.  The soup base is key and though I wish they had fresh noodles, it's not a deal breaker.  You can try anything else on the menu such as the BUN or rice dish and equally won't be disappointed.  As my buddy himself is a connoisseur of good PHO, he is always on the hunt to try new places and usually takes me along and PHO Mi Asia is our go to place.  Service is friendly enough but as can be expected, they're more about efficiency and turnover than making friends but this is more a factor of their shyness perhaps than anything.  Still, no matter.  The food is quick, delicious, and plentiful, and that's more than enough for me."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! Server was in a \"loud voice\" talking to us (feels like she's yelling) We ordered Large soup, grilled pork with rice & a veggie rolls but The server asked us to order more since we were 4 in a table. Eventhough my husband doesn't want to eat! Server still insisted us to order one more. Lastly an insect is roaming around our table while we were eating!! I don't recommend this! Will never come back here"}
{"text":"Vietnamese restaurants are known for efficient service but this one has gone overboard. I arrived around 9pm on a Saturday night and they had a bunch of chairs stacked up and a lady was sweeping. The restaurant was half full. So I went in and asked if they were closed. They said no and seated us at a four person table.   My table ordered cha gio, bun bo hue, and two rice dishes. While we were waiting for our food, they asked us to move to the long table. We were a party of three. So they picked up our tea cups and teapot and we moved there. None of the dishes were good! I had to add extra fish sauce to my bun bo hue because it was so tasteless. The meat also tasted odd.   Before we finished eating, they sat another party on the outer section of the long table. It was impossible for me to get out so I had to ask the other customer to get up first. How inconvenient. I know that some restaurants do seat different parties at the same table but only when they are packed. The restaurant was only half full yet they sat the other party at the long table with me because they were now cleaning and sweeping the back section of the restaurant.   There's a bunch of other pho restaurants nearby. Take your pick and avoid this place."}
{"text":"One of the best authentic vietnamese joints in town. Wish they had something like this in the East end where I live.  All food options (pho, com, bun) are excellent and flavourful and fast. Two people can get stuffed for under 20 bucks.  If you come not expecting impeccable service but simple tasty food at a great price you'll be a happy camper.  Rule of thumb when it comes to viet food: good if owner is viet, mediocre if owner is chinese-viet, and run away if owner is hongkongnese. And stay well west of yonge."}
{"text":"BEWARE DIRTY AND DISGUSTING RESTAURANT WITH LAZY EMPLOYEES WHO CHARGE A SERVICE FEE FOR TEA AND WATER!!!!   I used to live in this area when I was younger and this restaurant was my family's go to place whenever we wanted pho. Service back then was great. Now that I'm older, I decided to eat at this restaurant since I was in the area and I remembered this place as a really delicious Vietnamese restaurant.   The workers are DISGUSTING. I was seated at the table where I can see all the employees behind the cash (where they make smoothies). The lady was making an avocado smoothie and she was peeling the avocado with her bare hands. NO GLOVES! Did I mention that she didn't even wash her hands first? I was so disgusted by what I saw.   Service is TERRIBLE. All the employees just chit chat in their language behind the counters. When I asked for some water, the lady had to ask someone else to do it, which I didn't understand since after passing the task, she just continued to chit chat with her coworkers.   When it came time to pay the bill, I was told a price higher than I expected. I ordered food worth $12.50 and was being charged $15.25 after tax.  $12.50 plus tax is $14.13. When I asked why am I being charged more, I was told that there is a SERVICE CHARGE OF $1 FOR THE SERVICE, TEA AND WATER. I was shocked to hear such thing. Apparently service, water and tea are not free since she said NOTHING IS FREE. I didn't bother to leave a tip. And she questioned where's her tip. I told her I paid a \"service fee\", there's no need to tip."}
{"text":"Shrimp and pork fresh rolls (small): large portion, low cost, mostly vermicelli filler. Small order is two large rolls. Should have more meat, veggies inside  Rare beef and chicken pho(small): fresh, lots of meat, noodles, great portion. Not a lot of flavor. Comes w lime, bean sprouts, basil (all fresh).  Condiments great Service fast but emotionless (usual busy pho service) Nothing crazily amazing. Huge menu would attract indigenous or exploratory patrons. Seems solid, clean, fresh... Won't come back unless I'm in the area and craving pho.  Very very busy at 1pm"}
{"text":"Our go to Pho place, we order for pick up and call ahead and they are very quick. Have moved out of the area but can't find another Pho that compares."}
{"text":"Best pho place in Downsview! Order 205 is one of my favourites which includes beef balls and think slices of cooked beef! The broth is very fresh and has a nice kick to it. Little or no MSG in my opinion since I don't get thirsty after drink the beef broth. Order 528 rice dish is generously portioned and ideal for food coma afterwards! Order 302 and have it with dry glass noodles on the side. This option is similar to dip ramen in Japan but of course a Vietnamese style! Very tasty indeed!   Service wise is same across the board on all pho. Don't expect much! Waitresses have basic understanding of English. Eat and go! Not an ideal environment to spend time at!"}
{"text":"The pho and seafood congee is good (the only items I order), but they completely lack customer service. There have been several times where I've experienced this. The most recent one being that I went here with my family after my graduation since it was the closest restaurant near my house that was still open at 10:20pm. They completely rushed us, which is understandable because their kitchen closes at 10:30, but they rushed our food which ended up being too watery (congee) and lacked its usual delicious flavour (pho). Also one of the workers was sweeping the area right beside our table where the broom could disperse all the dust onto our food that has accumulated throughout the entire day. Another negative experience was when me and my friends went to grub here during our lunch break. One of my friends I went with also had bad customer service experiences with the SAME worker that treated us like we were unimportant customers. She doesn't smile AT ALL even when we say thank you and she has this smug face almost all the time, except when she serves several other customers (which I've observed). I felt that she treated us like random, unimportant customers because we were obviously students, and that she regards the elderly with more respect. I may be wrong, but that was the vibe I received from her. Bottom line, I like their food, but they definitely have a lot of room for customer service improvement."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA, by a long shot. Everything I've had here has been consistently fresh, flavorful, and well priced. Service is friendly, and the place is very clean. There is no better Pho or Bun Bo Hue in the GTA. I've been probably between 30 to 40 times, so that should hopefully indicate how much I love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Pho Mi Asia (the Mississauga location near Dixie and Dundas) for ~ 3 years.  I am a fan of their rice dishes...I love the broken rice texture and their bbq meats are pretty decent.  Their pho is a hit or miss.  Sometimes the base is flavourful and other times it is water-downed.  Therefore, I stick to the rice dishes.  Their prices are modest (e.g. $6.95 for bbq pork/chicken with rice dish, $6.50 bbq pork vermicilli and spring roll dish, and $4.95 for small pho). One of the reasons I loved going here was because the staff were warm helpful.  They would even bring a small bowel with scissors for my little one (to cut her food into small pieces -- really helpful).  I am not sure if there has been ownership changes, but the last couple of times the customer service has not been great.  The owner/manager (never really saw before this month) can be quite rude and does not come to greet you readily. There are a lot of pho places now.  I may have to go somewhere else where the food is comparable, but the service better...it really is too bad."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week. They make a mean canh chua( sour soup). And have to have their coffee. My fav in Mississauga"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Pho I've had in the GTA. Soup base is full of aromas, and the meat is of high quality. You can taste the difference between a good bowl of Pho and a bad one. What you get here is simply the best."}
{"text":"Good food but service leaves something to be desired.... This is the only restaurant that tells you where you must sit.."}
{"text":"Putting the review I wrote for Google places here because I really hope nobody has to have the terrible experience I had.   My parents are from Vietnam and i've grown up eating at various Vietnamese restaurants around the GTA, and this is by far the most atrocious restaurant we've come across.  Don't expect the servers to give you change even if you put $140 on a $110 order. It is their deserving right to get that tip for having the courtesy to stand there tutting at you while you're deciding on an order the moment you sit down.  They totally deserve that tip for getting your order wrong, charging you for the wrong order, and telling you to suck it up if you don't like it.  They totally totally deserve that tip for impatiently staring down a little girl finishing her food so she can grab the bowl out from in front of her the moment she puts the last beef ball in her mouth.  They totally deserve that tip for rushing you out of the restaurant the moment that little girl puts down her chopsticks.  Is this some new form of efficiency I've never heard about?  If I could rate it 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"So far so good. I've been there on many occasions and never disappointed. The pho is flavorful and much better than most places I've tried. Love the coffee as well. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food is great. Read the reviews please. But the only thing is they ask for 10% tip so be aware!"}
{"text":"this place is my go to place (and pho linh).   The food comes out within 10 minute of ordering and it's probably as authentic as it can get. Being raised by a vietnamese mother, i've had good, authentic food my entire life, but when she doesn't feel like cooking something that I'm craving or when I want comfort food this place is where I go.   Service is as expected for an asian place, not very personal, the servers are just focused on bringing you your food and then you eat and you're out. When I want a milkshake or the durian or avocado shakes this is the place I go to as well."}
{"text":"+: Food is decent. Pho (rare beef pho) is not too oily compared to some other Vietnamese restaurants.   -: Service is not good. Waitresses are rude. Place is fairly dirty in general. Small space, so very crowded at times."}
{"text":"Came here today on my way to Yorkdale for Christmas shopping.  Ordered my typical item bun bo Hue.  While the broth still flavourful, the sausage didn't taste fresh at all.  This is a let down and I hope they improve on the quality control and consistency.  Everything else is ok, they don't skimp on the portion and tables are still being turned efficiently."}
{"text":"Food is very good.   However very tight and uncomfortable as we had to share our table with others.  Very busy, service is quick."}
{"text":"Joint is ghetto like most Viet restaurants and that usually means authenticity. This stands true for this location. I would recommend their Pho but Vermicelli is mediocre. Dish is good but the accompanying fish sauce is lacking in flavor. Overall, not bad but could be improved. Worth a visit none the less"}
{"text":"Ate here one night with the family. Got turned off cause when my wife took a bite there was a piece of metal in her soup. They brushed it off like it always happens not coming back here ever"}
{"text":"I can't count the number of times I've gone this restaurant but it's been since they opened. During those times, I would say I pretty much never really had any issues. The food is awesome which is what kept me coming back. I knew what to expect in Asian places in Toronto...you won't get good service but most of the time, the food is great. Today was particularly bad and I felt so bad for my husband who is normally a very easy-going guy and very loyal. He's Vietnamese and today, he felt that his people let him down. This would only be the 3rd or 4th time I've taken my husband here in 10 years-ish. Things were good for the most part from the moment we walked through the door. Food was quick...mine not so pretty tho. There were little bits of raw beef on the edges of the bowl. The food is too good so I ignored it. When we were trying to pay was when it all went to shit. The lady serving us was done with her shift apparently. She was throwing her sweater on and grabbing her stuff behind the register while talking loudly to her coworkers in Vietnamese. My husband was standing there for a good 10-15 min and she completely ignored him. He understood every word and heard her tell another lady to deal with him. When we walked out, he told me they are AWFUL. I totally agreed. This was the worst experience I had there."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Best Pho in the city. I've been coming to this restaurant for over 15 years. Prepare your self for no service what so ever."}
{"text":"Quick and fast viet restaurants with good dried noodles and pho. Pretty cheap and you get what you would expect from these type of quick Vietnamese establishments. Don't expect the service to be amazing."}
{"text":"Can I give negative stars? My experience with this place was HORRIBLE.  - arrived on a late holiday Sunday night pretty desperate for food, staff sweeping the floor with dirt and food residues two hours before closing and half the people still eating. The chairs were flipped upside down onto table so when the staff put chairs down to sit us, we got concerned and had to clean our own table and utensils.  - waitress was VERY rude, she sat us on the inner end of a long table facing a wall where it wAs impossible for my friend to get in and out with people on the outer end. We had clearly asked for a new table, and there were empty seats on other half of the restaurant, but waitress plainly said no.  - now the food: we were praying that food would be amazing cuz we were so hungry that we would just let go of poor service if food was good. But pho soup was very salty, noodles starchy, and beef brisket tough like rubber   - we asked for our bill to get the hell out, the lady pointed us to cashier, no word. The bill came to be 16.95, we paid 17 (even that was too much tip) the lady looked at the money and said to us: the bill was 16.95, repeatedly. How they thought we were gonna leave any tip was beyond me."}
{"text":"This is my family's absolute favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the city. The family's from Vietnam and have a very particular sense of taste when it comes down to their familiar cuisine, so we have had to try many many places over the years to come to this conclusion. On average, we come here about 2-3 times a month. There are also 1-2 other good Vietnamese restaurants in Mississauga but we don't like trekking that far for a casual dinner.   The broth for the pho is always very tasty, not watered down or filled with MSG like a lot of other restaurants. The owner is authentic Vietnamese, along with the other servers - it just feels nice to be able to converse in Vietnamese when you're actually in a Vietnamese restaurant. The owner isn't too chatty/friendly but the service is ok.  There is not much to do in the area of Wilson/Keele so definitely have a car if you'd like to head out afterwards. It's right next to a Beer Store and Value Village. The restaurant is always quite busy but you never have to really wait for a table unless you have a large group.   Nothing upscale or fancy about the decor or service, but it's the food that's good. The Chinese items on the menu are not something to recommend though! Prices are reasonable, nothing is overpriced. For a dinner with 4 people it usually comes up to $35 at most with tips and taxes."}
{"text":"I like to go here once in a while, their pho is good and the place is okay. It's a nice place for a get-together since it's quite spacious."}
{"text":"A small hidden gem right at the intersection of Kennedy and Ellesmere; their serving sizes for pho or soup is a little smaller than other places I've been to. Otherwise, the service is great and their crunchy spring rolls are bomb!"}
{"text":"Our fav Pho spot in Mississauga! They make the best Canh Chua and they don't skimp on the portions."}
{"text":"Food is good but the place isn't cozy. Been coming here for a quick meals. Try their special pho. Prices are cheap considering the servings."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I either get beef, spring rolls and vermicelli or pho. The food is consistently good and the waitresses have all been nice. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I wonder how do they run the place with rude staffs, it's non of my business to talk but i just wanna share some experiences to people who is going there. I saw a staff who drop a f..king silly fish sauce on a gentleman jacket then she pretend like nth happened at all and she still laugh with her coworkers and may think the guy doesn't know. Thanks god he found out the f..king silly fish sauce is all over his jacket. Be aware of their rude staffs and I hope they should go to a moral training course to change their bad behaviourssssssss. Overall rude staffs, bad service and dirty place. They also talked too loud in Vietnamese language and they clean the floor while we were eating.  Piss off   Won't go back to see their rude staffs at all.  ZERO Star"}
{"text":"My friends and I came for lunch before heading out to our festivities for the day. We ordered - bun bo hue - special pho - beef and beef ball pho - rice - cha gio - three cafe su da The food was definitely a disappointment. The cha gio was so over fried it turned white and it had so much taro as filler - that's literally what we tasted. My bbh was made with what tasted like pre-made soup base with not enough flavours (the red was concentrated on one side of my bowl). Although the portion was decently sized, I felt that the quality isn't there. Probably will not be returning."}
{"text":"Hands down the most authentic Vietnamese food in the GTA, very delicious Pho, vermicelli, and rice dishes. They serve you a side of beef broth soup with your rice order! Which is how it's supposed to be, it's sad how most places fail to do that these days. I come here often from the other side of town. Easily my favourite. Service is fast and attentive and I absolutely love hearing the Vietnamese ambient music as I slurp on a perfect steaming hot bowl of Pho Dac Biet."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place!    The area is large, the service is fast, the place is open relatively late, parking is not a struggle, prices are cheap.  Not a huuuge fan of the soups but the main course type dishes are pretty good - reminds me of homestyle cooking.  One of my favourites was the carmelized (with fish sauce) prawns with bacon bits.    I'm sorry I can't write a more detailed review since the last two times I ate here was in August and it is now December.  I would have loved to return but my husband is not a fan and the location is a bit far.    But, if you enjoy homestyle vietnamese cooking, check out Pho Mi Asia!"}
{"text":"This place has been for many years, I even remember when my parents use to bring me here when i was about 12-13 years old. Nothing to fancy here but good family owned environment!  Always an enjoyable time when we go out here for a quick dinner. Most recommended dish will be obviously their pho dac biet (special famous beef noodle soup) with all the works including thinly sliced beef, beef balls, beef shank, beef tendon (mmm my favourite!) and noodle with lots of bean sprouts and mint. Be sure to remember to squeeze a hint of lime juice to heighten your tastebuds.  Very Cheap meal considering a bowl that will fill you up to your hearts content from 5-7$.  PS REMEMBER TO TRY THEIR ICED COFFEE WITH CONDENSED MILK!"}
{"text":"When it comes to comfort during those nasty cold winters, I seek for pho. This is my favorite spot in the North York area. I like this restaurant because there broth is delicious. This isn't a place for good customer service, beautiful decor, nor is it a place to seek for smiling faces. It is simply a place for traditional pho.  I have been going here for years and I never get tired of it. As I write this, I am starting to crave for pho. Should I eat that again today?   It is an affordable adventure. I mostly enjoy good food at an affordable price. I usually just get a large bowl of pho, shrimp & pork rolls, and an avocado shake. The rolls are nothing great, but I enjoy it. There vermicelli bowl, chow mein, and their egg noodle soup is worth trying.   My rating is a 4, for their good pho! You will be a happy camper. Now how many times have I said pho?"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE! My mother came to visit me in Toronto and on the last day of the trip she wanted some pho before flying home so naturally, I brought her to the place I go when I crave for pho. They were okay busy on a Friday afternoon and we got our table right away, but just as we put our order in, one XL of house special that the two of us were going to share because we were still somewhat full from breakfast, they sent it back, asked us to order more items and that they won't accept one item per two customers. After pleading our case and they still insisted, I walked out of the place. They would have had to give me the same table had I dined alone anyway, so why make it so difficult for people? Worst customer service ever. Would not go back, EVER."}
{"text":"The pho was very flavourful and generously portioned.  The medium here for $6.50 was probably the size of a large downtown (not $6.50).  Don't expect much in terms of service though.  It's curt, but not offensively so."}
{"text":"Very authentic Viet food!   Other than pho,  my personal favorite is filtered coffee with condensed milk. The only con is that not all servers speak English and service can be a little slow.  Nevertheless,  the price and food quality make up for it."}
{"text":"Also their chicken fried rice is massive and delicious. Add a fried egg! Also #528 on the menu is a favourite with my friends. Called the Epic meal now"}
{"text":"pho here so delicious compared to others.  they aren't stingy on the meat, etc. and the broth isn't full of oil/fat.  price is cheap too."}
{"text":"I am kinda torn. I order the Bun Bo Hue and thought it was just OK. Not sure if it is because my few exposure to BBH is from dinners with my Vietnamese friends and families. I thought the broth was OK but lacked depth.   Their fried chicken wings was also a bit odd - the fried wings were not seasoned. Instead, I had to dunk it into a sauce that was close to a Ranch Dressing. I never had anything like that before and thought it was just OK.   However, given that the restaurant was packed with satisfied customers gives me the impression that this should be a 4 star restaurant. Maybe I should have ordered Pho as my reliable indicator.   I think it is worth it for you to try. I will try this restaurant the next time I am in TO."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service here is awful. The servers are rude. Even when asking for water or an extra bowl, they give you a dirty look. They do not let you share at this location and make sure you order enough for the amount of people there. Me and my sister were hungry so my dad brought us here but he had already eaten. They were very rude and said that not enough for three people. My dad said he had already ate. They glared at us until we were done. Never coming back here"}
{"text":"Best \"Pho store\" Hot Pot Ive tasted yet and delicious fried rice. I always order the Lau Thai lan, and they jam pack the plate with a great variety of seafoods, meats, and veggies. I had a bad experience coming in the first time with coworkers as they spoke badly about us not knowing I speak fluent Vietnamese. They were surprised when I answered in Vietnamese, and I have had quite the service ever since."}
{"text":"I may have found my new favourite Vietnamese place. For one thing, other than a couple of tables of office workers, the restaurant was full of Vietnamese people. Also, the prices were very reasonable, and it's pretty easy to get to.  I got takeout from this place and based on Dong L.'s review, tried the Bún bò Hu. Sweet mother of mercy!  The menu describes it as \"'Hue' style beef & pork with vermicelli soup.\" Although correct, it would be like describing a Picasso as \"dabs of paint on canvas\".   I took the package to work and opened up the styrofoam container to find it brimming with shredded cabbage, some other stringed vegetable, herbs, bean sprouts, noodles, beef and some sort of ham. I opened up the accompanying soup container and got instantly punched in the face with a heavenly fragrance of spice and herbs. Inside the soup were slices of pork hock and blood jello. I put it all together and may have had the best soup noodles I've ever had in my life. The soup was a little salty, but all is forgiven as everything else surpassed my expectations.  I can't wait to go back and try out the other stuff on their menu, including the giant pancake that some lady got, stuffed with... I don't know, I didn't want to stare."}
{"text":"I can guarantee you that this will be the best Pho you've had in the GTA. It is only authentic place where the SOUP IS NOT WATERED DOWN.  You know how other Pho 99, Pho Hung, etc. soup is clear (meaning you can see the bottom of the bowl) and filled with msg/water? This place is where you can find the best soup as it is full of true flavour and a brown color filled bowl. Pho at its best!  Pho is all about the soup and most importantly the time the bones are brewed for. I can guarantee that their soup here is no where close to any other place."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot if I'm driving along the 401 and a get hit by a sudden craving for Pho.    Usually it's coming back into town from some road trip in the west (ergo anything west of the Saugga).   If I'm hungry and I'm thinking, I'm not going to make it back home to cook (let's be honest too lazy) I'll pull off the Keele exit and head north.  It's a solid bowl of broth, and you get all the yummy bits in their special.  Nothing pretentious or super special.. just a solid no non-sense bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"Great restaurant if you are ever craving a delicious bowl of pho in the chinatown Mississauga area.. This is the 3rd time that I have been here and the broth is consistent each time: not too salty or oily but with lots of flavour. That serving of meat in each bowl is pretty sufficient. The side plate of bean sprouts and mint leaves is the most freshest that i've ever seen at any pho restaurant. I also like the fact that the restaurant is super clean and spacious so its not just their food thats good but ambience. They say usually the dirtier it is, the better tasting the food! Lol! The one thing that you cant expect here is good service. Its decent on most occassions but sometimes you might get the snarky little waitress with short hair. It's really hit or miss then again it's an asian restaurant. Overall, my go-to-pho resto in sauga!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a small plaza at the corner of Blundell and Dundas, I would have never known about it if it weren't for Yelp.   I like that it's a standard pho place that may be a bit hidden from all the crowds.   at 12:30 today, it wasn't that busy, and we got our food quick.  My Pho with tendon, rare steak and tripe, (medium size) came with a lot of noodle, and 2 pcs of tripe and 2 pcs of tendon, about 5-6 pcs of steak.  Actually this is one of the first places that served a large ratio of noodle to meats.   It came with all the dressings - the bean sprouts were small, not a deal breaker.   We also got a rice paper roll, quite big, and good to share. except it was filler with a lot of vermicelli and not enough stuffing.   for 2 of us, it was $16.50. Not complaining. Will come again."}
{"text":"The food was good, ehich is why I come here.  However, their customer service is terrible."}
{"text":"Actually I want to rate this 2.5 *'s. I got the #203 well done and rare pho. Let's break it down. The broth good, noodles good, veggies good, well done beef not bad & rare beef was bad. Chewy, I guess broth now hot enough to cook it thoroughly. Let me put it this way I am writing this in my bed cause I got sick from it. I have been constantly having pho at different places for the past month and a half but I have never been sick. I will probably not go back."}
{"text":"I would have given Pho Mi Asia a 3 star review - ie. average - but their Pho is really quite good.  The broth tastes delicious and they have a generous serving of beef.  The bowl comes out quick and piping hot.  A quality meal for its price point especially on a cold day, or if you're feeling kind of sick. $7 bucks with tax and small tip for a medium.  The grilled beef is passable although, I find that they don't cut the beef into small enough pieces.   Nothing spectacular. That's just my preference.  Again, they provide a generous serving.  $7-8 with tax.  Spring Roll - I find their roll oily but still delicious.  They provide a little vermicelli salad on the side.  $4.00 for two rolls.  Avocado Shakes - The reaction I get from most people is that avocado shakes can't be good.  Ha!  On the contrary, they are quite delicious.  They are creamy, although, they definitely put a lot of sugar into the shakes here.  $4 with tax.  I can't speak for the rest of their menu except that there's a bajillion food choices.  Why was I tempted to give it only three stars?  Well, I must say that sometimes their service can come across as rude.  They take orders quickly and food comes quick but service isn't really pleasant.  Think of that actor Ben Stein and his monotonous delivery.   If you're big on having a smiling waitress who will gladly answer any questions you have about pho and Vietnamese, this is not your place.  If you just want a bowl of pho and you want it damn fast, this is your type of place."}
{"text":"Good food :) but the owner is not quite nice. I feel like I was not welcome there."}
{"text":"*Gross alert*  True story:  Don't mean to trash this place, but we used to come to this place quite a bit before, and then there was this one time that one of us spotted a waitress trying to floss her teeth with her bare fingers, and she was the one taking out the noodle bowls. Ever since then, we have stopped coming here. But recently we found out that waitress is no longer working there, so we brave souls came back here to give it another try. FYI - We never got stomach aches after eating here.   Adventurous Option:  This time I felt extra adventurous and ordered the vermicelli with anchovy and fish soup (#426 on the menu). This soup also included shrimp paste, so definitely not recommended for anyone that can't handle fishy smell and taste.  The surprising thing about this bowl was that I got a variety of ingredients (okra, fish fillets, shrimp, eggplants, squid).  It was definitely an interesting bowl full of surprises and flavours.   Safe Option: You could always get the rare beef noodles. Another option that was still conservative or safe would be the My Tho rice noodle soup  - transparent noodles (#303 on the menu) which had a predictable broth base with seafood ingredients.   Bottom line: It's alright to come here if you don't have a high standard of cleanliness*, want Vietnamese food with affordable prices, and quick service."}
{"text":"READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE GOING ! ----------   AGAIN... PLEASEEEE READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE ENTERING THIS PLACE! Now that i have taken the time to yelp the restaurant i realize I should have read the reviews first, before entering this place.   I wish That i hadn't gone in there with my family this afternoon. Worst Viet restaurant ever. This place is filthy and the service is horrible. Take into consideration that I was in a good mood walking into this place. Walking in i saw dust bunnies- all around the first set of doors but I figured hey, leettss see whats inside, Im hungry. My initial reaction was - Cool not dirty at all.. again were hungry, lets eat !  -Portions are good. - Chicken fried rice turned into fried rice with chicken on top COOL BUT the rice was very moist in oil.  - (L)arge Chicken pho; broth was actually not bad at all BUT barely any chicken. (mostly just skin and fat.. ewwwww)  - Spring rolls were alright..BIG but just alright - Chicken wings were horrible. Way too much flour was used. 7/8 wings weren't eaten. I'm surely glad i didn't get a (L)arge bowl, like the waitress told me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ - Didn't get to pick our own seats; lady quickly hollered for us to go where she pointed -_-  - Waiter did not greet us after hollering at us where to sit! No eye contact at all.. but did however serve us WARM TEA-- -Table of 6 got 2 menus .. OKAY that's interesting. -  After getting our food we asked for 2 small bowls and 2 forks. I swear that task took the life out of our waitress like it was to much of a trouble to do. We were even hesitant to ask for a small plate so that the rice could be shared. GOSH - When we told her our wings weren't good she seemed so defensive. LIKE CHILL! We'll pay for them but remember THE WINGS ARE NOT GOOD, TOO FLOURY and PALE IN COLOR! - Oh yeah did i mention that they don't know english or even try. They were all just so rude and continued to talk amongst themselves, especially after that complaint. - What a horrible meal.. As I went to the front to pay I told the lady I had had a terrible time being there.. she said in a very rude tone \"then don't come back if you don't like it.\" WHAT? like I can hear a friend blunty saying this but the cashier?? the face of the restaurant, really?  UGH NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK! WORST $53.60 EVER SPENT !!"}
{"text":"Their food is standard I've noticed with other pho restaurants, they were good but not mind blowing. What really knocked off the stars for them, is the waitresses here clearly don't care for getting anything you ask. We asked for water like 8 times, each of us trying that waitress. She would look at us and say yes. But never would she come back with the mystical cup of water. So can't really give them more than 2 stars for the anti social waitress that served...erhm or didn't serve us."}
{"text":"Some consistently good Pho, I frequent this place whenever I need to go to Yorkdale or in the area. I always getting the Pho rare beef and brisket which comes with plentiful meat and noodle, you can also definitely tell they've stewed the soup base at least for a night or so. Spring rolls are pretty sizeble as well. I've been told the seafood or more traditional Vietnamese dishes are really good too.   Its right beside the beer store as well if you're making a beer run.   Prices are typical of most Pho places."}
{"text":"Since this is my first review, on Yelp,  let me recommend a Pho place in my neck of the wood.  If you want the best Vietnamese food in the GTA, you must head to North York.  This is where most of the Vietnamese live.   Although recently, they move north of HWY 7 to Vaughan, most of the best diner still can be found in North York.    Pho Mi Asia is the place to go for the best Bún bò Hu and Banh Xeo. The broth for the Bún bò Hu is thick and tasty and they give you a large portion of fresh veggie.  The Banh Xeo is hugggge and crispy with slice of pork skin and pork fat.  By the way, their Pho is good too.  The only down side to this place is that their Cha Gio, Vietnamese Spring Roll, is good but not the best.  For the best Cha Gio, go to Pho Mi 99 on Jane and Finch.   So...why not 5-stars..becuase I've eaten at better Vietnamese restaurants  in LA, but this is number one on my list, in TO."}
{"text":"I go to Pho Mi Asia (I Love Pho 2) after I drop of my son at work in Mississauga on Sunday mornings at 10am. They are one of the few pho places open at that time. My wife is Vietnamese and she recommends this place and I understand why. The food is authentic, delicious and comes out hot. The prices are good and the place has a nice airy ambience and is quite clean. Now, the service is not the friendliest as the servers are quite kurt but they are efficient. Just typical Vietnamese restaurant level service."}
{"text":"I went two more times after my first visit and the quality of food has deteriorated a bit, the pho now tastes ok and also other dishes are ok.  I probably will not be going there for Vietnamese any more, as there other great places for the same price."}
{"text":"I come here all the time! Food is great. Portion sizes are fantastic, service is good, and pricing is VERY reasonable. I usually get the house special (#201) and there's a lot of noodles but a lot of meat as well.  I've recommended many friends and family here and I definitely continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Savory or sweet?... I had a tough time picking the last time I dropped in by myself.   It's perfect spot to drop in for afternoon tea with a friend. Hopefully they like to share, that way you can try more varieties.  Because I couldn't decide between sweet or savory, I ordered the goat cheese, pear and honey crepe. I thought it was a great combination, although I would have given it 5 stars if they had a little more cheese, it was under the 'savory' menu after all.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere : nothing special, table was not well cleaned   Food :  1. Bun Bo hue: way too much fish sauce, not a lot of meet, veggies were in fresh   2. Banh Cuon: flour roll was unfresh   Overall: won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my fave place. I've pho'd it up at most of the places around the GTA, and I keep looking forward to coming back here.  Probably gulped down 40 bowls of pho here over the years. Parking never a problem. Decor and smiles from the staff may be sub-standard, but who cares?!  When I'm having vietnamese, that's on the bottom of my list. Never waited for a seat, but there's always patrons here.  And I've eaten here at 10am, 3pm, and 9pm.  Always people here! Food comes out blazingly quick.  Last week, I ordered pho, and without a word of a lie, it was on my table with sprouts in 2 minutes!   Soup is spiced just right.  Aromatic and flavorful, but not doused in salt. Meat always seems good.  And I ate here in the middle of this whole XL Beef Recall. Portions are good, but I do always order an XL. At other restaurants, it seems half the time the basil comes out wilted or half brown.  Not usually a problem here. My biggest pet peeve about other viet restaurants is when they water down their sriracha hot sauce.  Trust me, I see this all over the place.  I take this as a litmus test for the overall quality of the restaurant.  However not a problem here.  If they do do this, I can't tell. I always pay up at the counter, so I can't speak for how quickly they bring the bill (though I know this is an issue at some other places). I only ever order the pho (usually rare and well done beef, sometimes brisket), so I can't speak for any of the other dishes here.  Hope this helps someone out there!"}
{"text":"To be perfectly honest I've not found that much of a difference between the 4-5 pho places in Toronto in terms of the food. I guess its one of those things that most vietnamese restaurants can't get wrong. Either that or I can't tell the difference. The restaurant is located right at the end of a strip mall and isn't too fancy. I'd say its decent for how cheap the food is here. About 6-7 for a medium bowl of pho. I haven't tried any of the other food here but going by the pho I don't think it should be too long. Also like most vietnamese restaurants it has a loooonnnnggggg menu. Around 500 items IIRC and you have to write down what you want on the little note pad on the table and hand it to the waitress. Service has been consistently decent and is a nice place to eat for cheap. Especially good on a cold night."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5  Ordered: grilled pork, spring roll & shredded pork skin with vermicelli ($7.50)  Whenever I'm in the Mississauga area I always come here for Vietnamese food. The portions are quite generous for the price and they have many options. Personally I like to order the vermicelli which is a dry noodle dish with various toppings and a sweet tangy sauce on the side but i have ordered pho as well.  I was surprised that the price was the same for most of the vermicelli even if the toppings were different. It's not the best pho I've had but you'll definitely feel full after. And if you have space for dessert (there's always space for dessert) you can order the Vietnamese three colour dessert (I think it's called che ba mau) which is ice with red bean and this green jelly. By far, it's the cheapest vermicelli and pho I've had which is perfect if you want to save money and fill your stomach."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. This is such a great Pho place! I could eat here all day, every day! Well...To a certain extent. But check this place out, great find for the area."}
{"text":"Real authentic pho!! I love it so much so affordable and fast no having to wait long for you food its worth every penny"}
{"text":"Best pho place to go in the downsview area. I been eating here for years. Since my uni days and I still frequent pho mi asia whenever I am nearby. The bun and pho are bomb. Rice dishes are another solid choice as well. The staff are basically the same ones I knew many years ago. Service is what you expect. You treat them well, they treat you well. Tip them please!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Waitress was blunt, no smiles, unresponsive, does not acknowledge. Might as well be 6 feet under, right?  Broth is mediocre and SALTY!!! Can't even serve proper authentic Vietnamese noodles. Just don't go...I don't think I need say more."}
{"text":"This is our pho place.  It's almost a second home, although we get their take-out almost exclusively.  We have an extensive garden that demands a lot of hard work, so on busy work days, we get their take-out to last our weekend.  I think you might get a better response from the very busy tireless owners if you caught their eye and spoke to them.  All I did was donate a couple of sunflowers once and I've got a Vietnamese auntie for life.  It's a small thing to touch someone's heart and they certainly have touched mine with nourishing, extremely healthy soup. I also turn to this amazing broth when I'm feeling like I might be coming down with something. Often that's all I need to turn something from a cold or flu into a one-day thing.  One bonus for us at least, the sturdy plastic take-out tubs make amazing small greenhouses for seeds started early. ;o)"}
{"text":"Good, fast and affordable Vietnamese joint.  Speedy service and low prices make it an excellent lunch choice.  Large menu with not only lots of pho, but good choices of vermicelli dishes (bun) and rice dishes.  Not fancy, but hits the spot.  A large pho is only six bucks."}
{"text":"This place actually took me by surprise. Their drinks are a little over priced, but whatever. Their pho was actually not bad. We were just looking for something close by to Yorkdale. It was only about 5 minutes away in the ghetto area of North York it seems. LOL! If we're ever in the area again I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and they don't cheap out on the protein portions. But I never see them smile. Then yesterday while I was eating a cockroach crawled across the table. I called the woman over and she used a kleenex to grab and squish it. Yeah. Left the rest of my soup on the table and went home."}
{"text":"Today will be my last time coming here and here are the reasons  - Poor Service, waitresses were unfriendly to the max - The Pho broth was super salty and they were cheap with the portions  - Witnessed with my very own eyes how the waitress made short trips to the WASHROOM to \"wash\" the sauce bottle lids......... disgusting ...disgusting    I don't understand how some people are giving this place 4-5 stars ..... absolutely ridiculous. There are many pho restaurants in the city that are WAY better so don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"I've been to many pho places around Toronto, and this place is my favorite by far. Besides being clean and providing fast service, the pho here is just amazing. Rich, full-bodied soup. Fresh noodles and beef (If you love meat, get extra meat on the side. These guys are super generous.) You won't be disappointed with the price you pay."}
{"text":"Worst Pho restaurant I've ever been to. I've been to at least 30. The beef in the soup wasn't right. It had a strange colour and smell and the broth had no depth whatsoever.  I ordered a drink. The food arrived first. One server walked by with her index finger firmed pressed into her eye digging for gold I believe. The Vietnamese spring rolls had a flaky tasteless, cracked flour mixture on it exterior and the menu described it came with a \"salad\" when in fact a leaf lettuce garnish was the truth.  3 servers also gathered in the dining area and spoke really loudly with total and complete disregard of patrons. Me and my gf are fairly easy going but quickly agreed we are never coming back."}
{"text":"It was okay. Nothing special. And the spring rolls were not as good as other Pho restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Fan of Pho but this place has great Pad Tai!"}
{"text":"3.5, bumped up 'cause it was quite clean and quiet!  Tea was also refilled which is sometimes an anomaly in places where your meal can be less than $10.  Personally, there's no need to be fancy as far as pho places go, re:  Lac Vien.  (I am not gonna pay more $$$ for Viet street food just 'cause the atmosphere is nicer.)  HOWEVER, they hafta be clean and Pho Mi Asia definitely fit the bill!  As per the other reviews, this place is quite hidden, just off Dundas, adjacent to Wacky Wings in a strip mall.  I just had a small pho + part of a spring roll + tried an Avocado shake.  All were good.  Broth was not MSG-y which is important to me.  Avocado shake was blended with ice, so less sugary.  Spring roll as well as other dishes rolled out in a timely manner!  One thing that I did notice was that I seemed to have less noodles than my bro, even though we both ordered a small.  So it was a small inconsistency.  There are tons of pho places in the area, but Pho Mi Asia definitely competes with the lot!  Tip:  If you're looking for a quieter place &/or need some privacy, and want pho in the area, this is a good option for you!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you have choices.  Take out took forever.  If you are not a regular and come in and order for take-out, everyone who is a regular and who order after you will get their orders before you (to take-out).  I spent $13.00 today on garbage.  Steamed shrimps had more bacon in it than shrimp.  It was disgusting and I waited for over 30 minutes.  So-called lemon-grass and garlic.  Also, wait staff treat their customers like children, ordering them around.  I have never seen people treated with such disrespect in a restaurant - and no one said a word.  Horrid place.  I am appreciating my regular Vietnamese restaurant (Forget Me Not) more than ever.  It just goes to show:  stick with tried and true."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday. Looks like a typical hole in the wall. Tables looked clean. They have a steady flow of customers (many different cultures) in and out. Service from the ladies was meh but whatever, I'm here for the food.  Tried the bun bo hue. The kitchen is super fast at getting orders to tables. I read some of the previous reviews about people inside the kitchen not wearing anything to catch hair...yesterday I observed the kitchen staff and they were all wearing a mix of either hairnets, caps, and bandanas. So, they fixed this practice., which is good.  My bun bo hue was a one size bowl for $8.50. It was pretty well sized with lots of toppings, pork blood, pork meat, beef meat, and vietnamese processed ham.   The soup was tasty and well seasoned (perhaps a tad on the saltier side), and had a nice kick of spice. The noodles were for the most part cooked well leaving a nice chewy bite, though some strands were undercooked and had a hard bite. I was not impressed with the meat... The beef and pork meat were so dry/tough/stale and not tasty. Seemed like all of the juices from the meat went into the soup. Overall, it was a nice noodle soup but nothing too spectacular as they seemed to have some meh toppings."}
{"text":"Come here often with my family and we like to get Pho, Vermicelli and Broken rice. The reason we come here is it's cheap and it's pretty tasty and made very well. It's one of those places that look slightly sketchy and has little service, but the food is worth the lack of service and decor. The dishes are always made perfectly and fills you up no matter what.  It's unfortunate so many people gave low reviews for this place or maybe they were just unlucky and came at a bad time. But I've been here many times and the food is always good. You can get pho for $8 and most of the dishes are $10 or under. Prices are very good for what you get, which is something we enjoy about this place.  You can even get vietnamese drinks here or just bubble tea, and it's not that bad either. But I recommend you probably stick to the food because that's what they're really good at here!"}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall Viet places. This place has been around a long time. It was never great, but it's really gone down hill. Service is extremely bad. Very rude staff (beyond whats par for the course with these joints), order mistakes. Food is average at best, and there are so many better vietnamese places around. There is just no reason to go here."}
{"text":"A craving for strong Vietnamese style coffee, no matter how heavily calorie induced the condensed milk is in the bottom of the cup..the nerve of even counting calories!!! Asian specialty coffees have a place in my heart.  Oh and the PHO here, you ask? Authentic with great tasting slices of protein and the soup base is darling to taste buds and ass kicking remedy to every cold symptom imaginable. The first sip of the hot soup makes everything better again, hunger pain wise.  The place went through much needed renovations, they got rid of the awkward green walls and splashed some modern taste for a refreshing and upbeat place, great choice.  Staff seem alert enough for a quick response to hungry monsters like me, with the normal request for wooden chopsticks for moi and a fork for the baby girl. Then hot sauce galore to bang bang those sinuses away.   My check-ins don't do justice to  the many times I've come to visit but do take my word that their special beef soup is highly recommended to anyone in need for a quick, authentic and satisfying bite."}
{"text":"After a night out drinking and partying my silbings and I decided Pho would cure any hangover. We arrived around 10:30 where we were impressed with the restaurant already open. When we arrived, we were greeted to sit down but we wanted to sit at a round table and the waitress quickly responded \"round only for 7\". We sat at a 4-6 table and was brought tea promptly. We have had food here and always enjoyed it.   We ordered shakes and liked them. The avocado, coconut, and sour sop. They were good.   We ordered pho soup which we can't complain about the taste or portion size. The soup is tasty and the size is well within reason of size. We also ordered \"bun\" and it too was tasty and sized perfectly to eat.   The food came out fast and hot.   The staff could have been friendly but due to the style of cuisine it is expected.   Overall we will return for the craving of pho and shakes!"}
{"text":"They changed the name to I Love Pho 2. I am giving it a 1 star as they use Ajinomoto Umami seasoning. I saw a big bag of it on my way to the bathroom. Now I don't know if this is the same as MSG. I was not feeling well after. Maybe it was psychogical but I am sensitive to MSG. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I would seriously give this place 0 star if that was an option. My parents and I have been very loyal to this place for years but over the years, their service has truly gone down to shit hole. The servers are very rude, loud, gross and have no consideration for diners. They organize their chopsticks with clanking sound on the table very loudly while diners are still there, talk very loudly with their coworkers in their own language and they never thank your business with them as if they're doing you some kind of favours. My parents always order the same kind of pho but few times, they didn't have any basil and they said they don't know when the delivery is coming. We let a lot of these incidences slide but not anymore! Today, they didn't have any bean sprouts then my parents looked slightly annoyed/disappointed. Instead of apologizing or offering other kind of ingredients, the server just shrugs her shoulders and says they don't have it as she walks away. Somehow, only 2 minutes later, they magically had their bean sprouts and the server said it's coming in a few minutes and said \"you're lucky!\" as if that ingredient isn't supposed to be in the food and we somehow got it by luck. No such server has ever managed to flabbergast me with a comment like hers in my life. I found that very strange, like they somehow don't want to serve certain ingredients if people don't ask for it but do if people ask for it, even though the ingredient is listed on their menu. It seems like they wanted to save what they had from the long weekend to make it last until the next delivery? Who knows but I just found it very fishy. Also, when you ask them for a cup of water, they seem to do it very reluctantly, pass off the task to someone else so they could chat with their coworkers and still expect good tips. When you look annoyed/disappointed, they seem to be on their toes and change their act a little but otherwise, the service changes for the worse time after time. In a world with so many other options, PLEASE do yourself a favour and go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"#430 curried chicken is delicious. Very generous portion of chicken in a bowl of coconut curry soup with potatoes. Choice of noodles in the soup or rice on the side.  We've been coming here for many years and have tried many of the soups and rice dishes. Never disappointed. Vermicelli dishes are served with thicker noodles than usual, but are always tasty.  Service is very efficient and restaurant is clean. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I literally thought this was one of the most conflicted restaurants I've ever been to.  First off, the restaurant itself was diiiirty.  I'm okay with dirty tables, dirty floors, and dirty walls.  I cannot cannot cannot find hair in my food or I lose my shit.  There was a looong piece of hair in my boyfriend's soup and as I look into the kitchen.. nobody there was wearing any sort of protection against falling hair.  The pho here is average but not fantastic and the rice (chicken, pork chop, and egg) my boyfriend ordered was decent but his rice was sogging into congee.  The waitresses are all about efficiency and it comes off as a bad attitude. I'm trying to pack up my pho (to go) she's reaching OVER me and knocking into my hand as I'm trying to pour the soup into the container.  Nope. There was nobody at the door and more than half the tables were empty - you can wait until I'm done pouring.    This makes me sad because I enjoy the Pho Mi Asia in Burlington.  PS. Try Forget Me Not down the street, the only reason I was here was because they're closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Our go to place, serve is quick but typical of Asian places not nice but they get you what you need. Food is authentic but their table tops are sometime sticky and sometimes have the wet towel smell, makes you feel icky. we go here because there are no better places. Prices were good before but they keep rising every few months it seems."}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about the delicious food I had for dinner last night, which prompted me to write my first yelp review.  Although it is a small restaurant by Yorkdale, I could tell I was in for a treat as this place was already packed with a line up of people at the front entrance, which is usually a good sign.   We were seated pretty quickly at the end of a long table with other customers, who were friendly enough to tell us which number they ordered as it was the noodle dish with the shrimp cracker and seafood soup, \"My Tho\", I think it is called? Compared to other ones I have had in the past, the shrimp cracker was bigger and you have the option of ordering the soup with the noodle or on the side. The noodles were flavoured with a soy and hoisin sauce with BBQ pork in it, and the seafood soup was perfect for the cold weather outside with pieces of squid, shrimp, and fish balls floating around sprinkled with generous helping of chopped green onion.     Also ordered the \"Cha Gio\" spring rolls that seemed to have more taro in it, which I thought were tasty but I've been told that there are better ones elsewhere.  And of course, I also usually have the jack fruit milkshake along with my meal, which came in a plastic cup that seemed more suitable if I was ordering take out...but maybe I'm just being picky about my dine in experience.  Anyways, I can't wait to go back to try their Pho and Banh Xeo!"}
{"text":"*REVIEW FOR I LOVE PHO (NAME CHANGE)* I came here after coming from church for some dinner, and ordered the 422 (Vermicelli with Grilled Meat, Shrimp, and Spring Rolls), and it was pretty decent.  My friend complained her 429 (Vermicelli with bamboo shoots and duck) wasn't very good however.  It came with blood curds for some reason (we're Vietnamese, so we could tell it was not the usual).  I read a few reviews about MSG and come to think of it, I was a bit tired after eating (but when am I not haha).  Didn't really phase me though...    The service was pleasant and quick, although I felt a bit rushed to order while waiting for my friend.  Also, the atmosphere was great, since it's a bigger and brighter environment.  Cleanliness was a plus as well.  Prices were the norm for a Pho restaurant (I heard it was cheaper, which is what attracted us to this place, but not really the case).  Anyways, I will probably return because it's close to my church but it wasn't that much of a special experience."}
{"text":"The food came really fast, was good and well served, but as the place was crowded, they didn't give us any attention. Affordable, I had a middle chiken pho for $6. 3 stars but has potential to get better."}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese food. The pho, vermicelli, rice and sour fish soup combo is great here. Service can be a dud sometimes but it's a minor setback when it comes with good and cheap food.   Be careful of double charges. A friend ordered a drink and when he never got it he reminded them and they tried to charge him twice."}
{"text":"Definitely have to thank the Yelp community for looking out on this one... was looking for restaurants reviewed in my \"hood\" so to speak and found this little gem...   My fiancee ordered the Chicken Pho (medium) which was easily enough for two people and it was very delicious. We've went to Vietnam for 2 weeks a few years ago and she mentioned it was better than Vietnam. Since she is Asia I will take her word for it.   As for me I had the fried shrimp and vegetables in black bean sauce and I would rate it a 4 out of 5 as they vegetables and shrimp were very fresh.   Seating is a bit tight which doesn't bother me, but seemed to bother the people beside us (we overheard them). Overall I would highly recommend this place for a visit."}
{"text":"I am heart broken as I write this review. This has been my absolute favourite pho restaurants to go to.  We are regulars eating there at least 2x/month or more.  On Friday June 15 in the late afternoon, my son and I dropped by at around 5pm for dinner.  I observed 3 situations of very poor hand hygiene that has forever left stain in my mind and has forever severed any future visits back to this once thought of authentic pho place whom I've raved about to my friends and family. Observed in order while I sat there for 45 minutes: 1.  Older elderly staff female (taller woman) kitchen cook /worker leaving the bathroom stall and only rinsing her hands with only water.  No soap was used. Then entered into kitchen to prepare food. 2.  Older elderly staff female (shorter woman) kitchen cook/worker entering into female washroom with food prep gloves on and then leaving the washroom with the gloves still on and then entering back into kitchen. 3.  A female server (with short black shoulder length hair) blowing her nose into kleenex and then throwing a way kleenex and continuing to serve food. This was absolutely devastating to see.  How can the management not reinforce the bare essentials of washing hands and instilling this very important aspect of food handling and preparation to the employees.  Needless to say I have called public health and they will visit the establishment and investigate.  Please be ware and hypervigilant if you go and try this place out.  Watch carefully."}
{"text":"The pho was pretty decent and it came out in less than 5 minutes. The broth was hot enough as well. Slightly more pricey than I'm used to compared to my usual spots in downtown toronto."}
{"text":"My first time visiting to this location. I try to pick our own table but instead they brought us in the corner were they use the table as their refill station. The table smells and it was not a good place for us to have a nice dinner. The food is fair but I may say! If they are going to serve good food they might as well start with good brand for their rice. Asian love rice and I say their rice is like the cheapest one on the market. We didn't eat the rice because of the pleasant smell. We go to pho restaurant and they give what customer ask, but this location is not stoping me for giving them a bad feed back. I think we won't be coming back to this location. The bar/cash counter need some work looks disgusting u won't imagine u get your drinks there. ( Thumbs down! )"}
{"text":"My favourite place for pho! My mom is friends with the owner, so I've been going here since this place was opened (maybe for 13 years?) Besides the occasional line out the door and long waits during peak times, service is quick and the food is great. I'm really picky when it comes to pho, but I think this pho is one of the best ones I've had so far."}
{"text":"It looks like I Love Pho has now replaced Pho Mi Asia. Everything is the same besides the name of the restaurant.   The five of us had dinner yesterday evening before it got busy. We arrived shortly after 5 pm and there were plenty of tables. By the time they got quite busy which is a good sign for a restaurant. The four of us ordered the bun bo hue and my boyfriend got pho. I tried the pho broth and it was average, nothing special. The bun bo hue is usually pretty spicy so we asked them to make it less spicy. There was plenty of meat and vermicelli so we were full when we finished. The one thing that I didn't like was that there was a bit much of MSG because we were quite thirst afterwards.  Service is what you expect from a Vietnamese restaurant. But I thought it was bad when the lady just shoved the tray onto our table to remove the bowls. She should've put the tray on the table beside ours and brought the bowls over one at at time. I've never seen anyone do this before.  This location is quite far from the original location on Burnhamthorpe. If my family wanted to eat out then we will most likely go to the other location."}
{"text":"I had to meet someone for lunch in west Toronto near 401, and had no idea where to go. A Chowhound friend suggested Pho Mi Asia. (She has since been banned from Chow for an unbelievably stupid reason!)    It turned out to be a great place to go to. We arrived just after the lunch hour crowd, but it was still fairly busy and the kitchen and waitresses kept everything moving smoothly. We had three orders of medium pho (huge!) and one order of squid in black bean sauce. The food arrived very quickly, all at once, and was perfectly cooked and spiced. The pho broth was excellent, and I guess they are getting a reputation for genuine pork broth. At least, that was my take on it, but I'm no expert on Viet food, yet!  Service was generally excellent, mostly by young students (I think) with fairly good English.  I would go back to this place any time I'm in the area, or maybe check out the Mississauga location."}
{"text":"What was once considered one of the best pho places in North York has now deteriorated  to becoming just another generic Vietnamese restaurant. While they still sling out bowls of authentic pho noodles at a lightning quick rate, the quality and consistency of their broth has gone downhill. And sanitation is becoming a real issue here, as you'll be hard pressed to find a pair of utensils that are squeaky clean. Be prepared to wipe down stains from their chopsticks and cups before you use them.   This place will suffice if you're looking to satisfy some pho cravings. Just don't expect to be impressed by the food anymore like in years past."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for lunch with my bf and his dad since we were in the area. I was craving banh xeo, the Viet crepe, and lucky for me they had it. My bf ordered the bun bo hue and his dad ordered pho.   The banh xeo here is pretty authentic, it came with lots of greens on the side including even some herbs that I didn't recognize but that my bf and his dad recognized (they are Viet). The crepe itself was nice and crispy, at least the top half. Unfortunately, a lot of the oil from the pan made its way to the plate so the bottom half of the crepe got kind of soggy.  It was filled with lots of the requisite bean sprouts and pork, but they were pretty light on the shrimp: one, possibly two pieces of shrimp.   My bf downed the bun bo hue and said it was probably the best one he's had in Toronto. It came with square chunks of blood (blood jello?) which doesn't always come with it at other restos. His dad gave his approval for his bowl of pho, which means it must've been pretty darn good because he's picky when it comes to pleasing him with food."}
{"text":"Great pho. Giving it 5 stars to bump up its rating after going to some high rated pho places that were horrible."}
