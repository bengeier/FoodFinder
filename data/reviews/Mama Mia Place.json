{"text":"The best churros! I drive all the way from Newmarket to pick up these churros and empanadas, and when I get close to home it's almost all eaten! Very traditional, cozy feel. (Georgian-Chilean) Background so I am definitely vouching."}
{"text":"Very salty.  I had the original & the Mediterranean empanadas & both were salty, more the Mediterranean than the original.  
The original had one black olive & half a boiled egg in it.  The shell was thick and dry."}
{"text":"Churrrrrrrros! Amazing! $1 each. Delicious!
Empanadas are tasty. Friendly, authentic owners. It's nice to have a unique place like this in Vaughan. Can't wait to get a big box of churros for the next family gathering. Worth a try, great prices!"}
{"text":"amazing burritos, best empanadas
hot-fresh-crispy churros while - u- wait !!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a few colleagues a couple weeks ago. We all ordered the chicken burrito. They make the burritos in the back so it's hard to know how much you can customize them. I simply asked for no dairy on mine. 

The burrito is huge and tasted fresh, but there was no heat in it whatsoever. Barely any spice. I tried their two spicy salsas that they have available at the side of the restaurant, but even those weren't very spicy to me and it was inconvenient having to add a bit of salsa each time I wanted to take a bite. I need my burritos spicy. Hot salsas, jalapenos (preferably fresh rather than pickled), hot sauce. There was none of that here and because they make it where you can't see, you don't know whether you should be asking for jalapenos and hot sauce. And fresh cilantro (What's a burrito without fresh cilantro, yo?). 

The churros were piping hot fresh out of the fryer and tasted so yummy. I burnt the roof of my mouth on a churro and it was worth it. 

Might come back to try one of their tortas, but I'm not running back for a burrito unless there's a way to spice it up."}
{"text":"~ A 3.5 Stars ~

We went to check out this restaurant during lunch hour. There is decent amount of seating and it did get slightly filled up. 

The restaurant was clean and you have to order & pay at the till but they bring the food on the table. The staff was friendly and the service was quick and good.

There is plenty to choose from and I went with a Vegetarian Burrito which came out nice and hot ready to indulge on, it was fully and nicely stuffed. 

Then on the side I ordered Spinach empanada & Sea food empanada. The Spinach empanada was good but I didn't enjoy the sea food empanada, as it included too much octopus and I am not a big fan of octopus. There are 3 different sauces lined up for your food and you can have as much by just garbing it from the sauce station in the restaurant. 

To close it off I went with Cholocate Churros, which was soooo good and fresh. They also have cuban coffee which was strong and quite good."}
{"text":"Had some empanada and churros for dinner last night! Not pricey and delicious!!!  Home-made salsa are good too - but I should say that I'd rather mix the mild and spicy (with Jalapeno) the next time.. Will definitely come back very soon!!"}
{"text":"We just came across this place when we were on our way to another restaurant, and we decided to stop by. 

When we got in, it gave us a old Mexican place feel. We read the sign outside saying Warm Hot Churros. Which is what initially got us to go in. 

We got to the front and ordered 6 Churros to go. We got a few in every flavor; Vanilla, Cinnamon, and Classic. There were other options as well to choose from. 

It took about 5 mins for the Churros to get to us. As we got home, I realized it didn't come with Nutella on the side. But the supervisor at the location told us they just provide the Churros. 

The Churros stayed warm by the time I got home and I had some with Nutella. They probably were the best Churros I've had. I would highly recommend this place for there Churros."}
{"text":"The empanadas were fantastic ! So were the Churros.  The best I've ever had.   The owner was very nice and friendly staff.  Was clean inside with great Latin music playing.   I did take out.  Sketchy looking neighborhood, still though worth the drive.  Would go back for sure .... very soon...like tomorrow !"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Great selection of empanadas including Chilean. Many dessert options including churros. All made in house. Tres Leche is delicious and creamy with a slight twist as it is made with rum. 

Now for my favourite...the sandwiches. Ah the churrasco. Steak, cheese and creamy avocado. It is perfection. 

Homemade condiments are on offer. 

You can sit in or take out. I love to buy some empanadas to take away. 

The owner is very friendly as are staff. 

Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"After craving some South American food I decided to give Mama Mia Place a try for their homemade style empanadas. 
The place is fairly new and bright with a Mexican flair. They display a wide variety of empanadas from Chilean, Cuban, Mexican, and Argentinian. They also offer sandwiches and freshly made churros on order. 
We tried six different empanadas which were about $2.50 each. After waiting a few minutes for them to be warmed up, we devoured each one. While the corn breaded ones were a little oily, the taste was pretty good overall. 
They also offer free salsa for your meal, a nice touch!
Final verdict: given its location, and reasonable prices I would be back to fill my craving. Next time, I would give the sandwiches a try!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here. Their sandwiches are so unique and delicious. And their home made salsas? I... I can't even. They need to sell jars of that stuff. The Churros are the best I know of in the area and you can get them stuffed with dulce de leche and nutella. They always have some to sample too.

Customer service is also clearly a priority to them. They're incredibly nice and friendly. One time, the owner came around to give everyone samples of their iced coffee (which was absolutely delicious; so much better than an Iced Cap!)

They only lose a star because of their empanadas, ironically. I'll be clear, they are not bad at all. They're just not great empanadas, especially considering how awesome everything else is. Stick with the delicious sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I drove by and noticed the CHURROS sign on the sidewalk which brings back old memories of my first great authentic Churros experience. That experience was at Hispanic Fiesta 2010 on September 4th and I was craving more but didn't know where it would show up. 3.5 *Stars* 

I didn't even notice that it was an Empanada & Grilled Sandwich place until I walked up to the counter. Left display was filled with 12+ varieties of Empanadas($1.95-$2.95) from Chicken to Cheese to Beef. 

The right display had Corn Pies(?), Alfajor, Churros($1.00-$1.75), Apple Pie($1.95) and other desserts. Hanging over the ceiling as a menu board was the Sandwiches($5.95) which uses a different type of Bun. From the outside you would think the inside would be a DUMP but it's a great little place inside with that Latin flavors, sights and sounds. 

Yup, at that pricing you can really snack on quite a selection where I got The Classic Beef Empanada which was put back inside the oven to warm up and then you go to the condiment counter to get your Salsa(Mild or HOT). 

Empanada is the size of a Jamaican Patty, the dough wasn't as bad as some of the other Empanada places I've been to. The Empanada($2.95) was actually pretty good stuff. Chocolate Filled Churros($1.75) was warmed up and nice crispy with warm Chocolate, YUM. The Apple Pie($1.95) was so-so but at least had decent amount of Apples inside. 

I got out the door just with the loose change I found inside my car. Btw, I noticed most everyone else dining in were having one of the BURGERS. I believe I shall be back for that next time."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Mexicana sandwich which I have had three times now since I learned this place opened. 

Tried the tacos which were very good; tried the beef and cheese empanada which was also good and tried the nachos which were a little too soggy and meaty for me but we're still good.

Really delighted this place is here, great friendly staff.

Now I have to convince them to serve chimichanga and life will be nice."}
{"text":"Came across this place completely randomly! Was looking for a quick bite to eat and was in the neighbourhood and decided to give it a try! Food is so delicious, I ordered the pulled pork tacos and had amazing flavours, definitely some of the best in the GTA. The churros are OUT OF THIS WORLD! Seriously, I'll have dreams about them. So fresh, made to order, what's better than that?! Plus a free salsa bar, omg. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Popped in today for lunch while waiting for an appointment.
As with my last visit, the food was fantastic. Two of us each ordered the chicken quesadilla....it was stuffed with shredded chicken, melted Mexican cheese and onions. Came with a mild salsa and guacamole, however we went over to the salsa bar to get some spicy jalape√±o salsa (they should really consider bottling this salsa and selling it). It certainly kicked up the heat factor ! 
Excellent food.
Topped the meal off with a still warm cinnamon/sugar churro. Holy hell it was good ! 
Already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Mama Mia! These churros are worth shouting about!

3.5/5 - Mama Mia Empanadas is a little shop specializing mostly in two items: Empanadas & Churros. They have a few other sweets available (shortbread, alfajors, etc.), as well as an array of sandwiches (which look tasty but I haven't had the pleasure of trying yet.)

There is plenty of seating, so either solo or in a group you can chill out and enjoy either a snack or a full meal.

On the side sweet I've tried the caramel crunch, alfajors, and shortbread (which all fell into the A-Ok range to me), but honestly, nothing compares to the churros! These are some of my favourite churros in the city. You can get them with cinnamon or sugar for around a buck a pop, or stuffed with Dulce de Leche or Belgian Chocolate for about $2 per. If you buy at least a dozen you don't need to pay tax - score! The ones stuffed with Dulce de Leche are by far my favourite. Each batch is freshly made so you get them piping hot, oozing with Dulce de Leche, and they are ooey gooey deliciousness. The cinnamon and sugar ones are also quite yummy, and there are usually free samples available for them if you'd like to check'em out! I'm not so much a fan of the Chocolate Stuffed churros (I don't really find the chocolate that flavourful and I don't think it adds much to the churro) - but maybe that's just my personal preference.

The empanadas are also quite cheap (around $2-3 or so each) - some baked, some fried. I've tried the following:

Ham & Cheese - my favourite so far. It's fried so a bit greasy, but stuffed full to the brim with cheese & ham so it is quite filling for one little empanada! Nice & flavourful.
Spinach & Feta - Whereas the ham & cheese had an abundance of cheese, I felt that the spinach and feta was lacking a bit of the feta side. Still tasty, and not fried so the dough was nice and fluffy
Sausage Chorizo - Eat this one with some of the complimentary sauces they have. I felt like this one was a bit one-note and could use something to liven it up.

Empanadas were overall good, but didn't leave me awe-struck and craving more like the churros did.

Mama Mia is most certainly a neighbourhood gem, and worth checking out if you happen to be in the west end of Etobicoke!"}
{"text":"Good prices.
Filling portions.
Clean place.
Delicious food. 
Welcoming and great staff.
The argentino sandwich and fries are so good !
Meat was a little to salty but overall everything was amazing ! 
The selection of empanadas and churros is very large ! Can't wait to try them alll"}
{"text":"Reading others' Yelp reviews, I had high expectations for this place. The only thing I agree on is that their churros are great. Walking in, it was completely empty, which is fine because then service will be quicker right? Wrong. The cashier came by and waited for us to order. We got Fries Supreme for $8.95 and two cinnamon churros for $1.00 each. It was $12.26 in total. I handed over $20.25. And then the cashier, as he is handling cash and about to give me back change, hears his phone go off so he picks it up. And so I wait....for at least 2 minutes for him on the phone so that I can get my change back. He finally tells the person on the other line to hold on, and he looks at me and says \"I owe you $7 something?\" I said \"no, I gave you $20.25 so you owe me $8.\" He says \"oh okay. Hold on a minute. I'll go grab change for you in the back.\" So he walks to the kitchen and continues talking on the phone. I can actually SEE him since you can see the kitchen and I stare at him waiting for my change. It has been at least 5 minutes now just waiting for me to get change back. So he leaves the store from the back exit and it takes about another 2 minutes before he pops back in. Almost 10 minutes to get back my change? Horrible customer service...I couldn't even sit down to wait for my change because he opened the register and started talking on the phone and since the register was open, I was just waiting for him to grab me my change. When I finally got my change, I took a seat and their cook walked over to place the food on our table. Now the food: we tried the fries supreme first and wow. It was very underwheming. Very salty and not even fresh cut fries. You literally get a better deal with taco bell's fries supreme. For $8.95, I expected better than fast food fries drizzled in cheese and sour cream. The churros were good and the sole reason why this isn't 1 star review. Also, this location will be moving as of March 2017."}
{"text":"Owner has very pleasant and friendly. I ordered ten empanadas, wanted to try them all so got a variety with different fillings. I also ordered some churros, can't go wrong for $1 each. He told me they were making everything fresh for me, so had to wait about 15 minutes. Churros were piping hot and delicious. They have a variety of flavours, but I stuck with the simple cinnamon sugar. I took empanadas home to eat with my husband. When I opened the box, I was shocked to see how dark brown they were. They did not look like the pictures. Took a bite and it was burnt. The shell was way over done. There was hardly any filling inside, all you could taste was burnt dough. All ten were like this. I would come back here for the churros and maybe to try the tacos. Will not be ordering the empanadas again."}
{"text":"I have a review but its based off of the old location....

I much rather prefer argentinian style empenadas but these were still very good. The highlight for me though was the bazillion delicious churros    I had a chocolate one and apricot one. 

When we went to the old place, it was not uncommon for you to hear spanish non stop in there. It felt very very authentic."}
{"text":"So the place is moving to woodbridge soon which is great for me. 

I'm more used to an argentinian style empanda but these were very good still.

The churros were delicious but its pretty hard to screw up a churro right?
I had the apricot churro and chocolate and both were great. 

The english isnt the greatest so be patient. Most of it is home style cooking so very good."}
{"text":"Had a chicken burrito which was good, but not the best I've ever had - seemed like it was lacking ingredients and full flavour or seasonings. The corn tortilla chips included was fresh and made to order as they were piping hot. The biggest issue with this place was the wait time - it took half an hour to get my order during the weekday lunch hours with a few others experiencing the same. This was likely due to someone calling in a large phone order earlier but then this restaurant (which is set-up as 'fast casual') should get more staff to handle the volume especially during busier hours. Overall, the bad experience with the wait time doesn't make it worth coming back."}
{"text":"Mama Mia Place newest location in Vaughan! 

Same offerings as https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mama-mia-place-toronto-4  but more spacious and welcoming! 

And of course Churros for $1 and up. How can I resist?

I do like the gluten free options for various empanadas as they were made from corn instead of flour. All empanadas are $2.50 each.

Though my coffee for $3 was so so even it was freshly made when ordered.

Will be back for some more affordable snack and of course Churros!"}
{"text":"Churros!! $1 each!

Mama Mia! 

Dulce de leche? Nutella? Cinnamon? Strawberry? Plain?

So many different stuffing for Empanada?! Maybe it is easier to get them all!

Cheap good pastry and sweet as snack.

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything 
Mama mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?

I don't know why I kept humming the song right away my Churros?!"}
{"text":"Kind of friendly staff, menu looks good but food is not.

The empanada dough is definitely not homemade and tastes like an old shoe.   They completely mixed up my order and I didn't realise it until I got home - which is almost an hour away so I wasn't about to go back and return it. 

I won't return and won't recommend them but I will always remember Mama Mia Place for giving me my very first severe allergic reaction to the point my throat closed up and I had to seek medical attention.

I should have know better not to return here after our bad experience in 2013"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic empanadas and churros...I highly recommend this place to anyone.  Family run business with great customer service and music playing in the restaurant! 

Totalmente aut√©ntico, cinco estrellas...tienen que probarlo!"}
{"text":"Staff is not too friendly. Churros were hot and fresh but i wasnt a fan of the hard tacos.... it just completely fell apart (what to expect) plus the sauce made the taco super soggy. ive tasted better tacos elsewhere."}
