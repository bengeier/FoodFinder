{"text":"My wife and I have enjoyed ChickiePoo's since we moved to Madison 6 months ago.  We feel strongly that it's the best place to eat in the area.  The food is outstanding (Chef Lucien), the service is excellent (Chef Lucien), the conversation is lively and intelligent (Chef Lucien).  And if Phoebe is around you might even get harassed, which is great fun.  Cash only.  Daughters sleeping in closets.  Unique silverware.  Small.  Ever-changing menu.  Everything is made from scratch (except extruded pasta) and locally grown and raised ingredients used when available.  Put it all together and you must Eat. Here. Now.  Or at least when they are open."}
{"text":"I am a Madison resident, and I often go to Louisville & Indianapolis restaurants  Since discovering ChickiePoo's, it has become my mission to bring friends from Louisville to Madison to share with them the unique atmosphere and gastronomic delights of this hidden gem I  just returned from introducing my visiting British cousin to ChickiePoo's.   I always start with theiced Vietnamese coffee - which is brewed on the table in a cool little personal-sized drip-brewer  which tests my patience, but is sooo worth the wait  Warning- it is addictive!  While waiting for the coffee to brew, we shared the PEI mussels appetizer, served in a large mussel-pot, designed to tilt so  that the delicious broth could be 'sopped up' (as we southerners say) with hunks of thick-sliced, course bread. Then a break for a nice salad before a main course of scallops, fresh al dente green beans & some kind of wonderful brown rice (must ask Chef about it next time)  We  finished with one large slice of pumpkin cheesecake  It was to-die-for...not the heavy (delicious in its own way) 'New York' style, but a light, creamy & oh-so-fresh concoction that celebrated the pumpkin flavor without being over powered by it. We left full but not feeling stuffed and soporific. The atmosphere is uniquely ChickiePoo's.  My best advice is to go with an open mind, an open heart,  an empty stomach and cash. Oh, & byob. Once you've had the ChickiePoo experience, you will be spoiled for life!"}
{"text":"Simply wonderful restaurant!  We were visiting Madison from San Francisco, and the food at ChickiePoo's is as good as some of the great restaurants we have at home.  The atmosphere is very homey, like having dinner at someone's house who is a great cook.  Unqualified recommendation, do not miss ChickiePoos!  Note, BYOB and cash only."}
{"text":"This is a local family owned cafe so there are only a few tables.  Very nice and comfortable inside.  The owners are great.  The menu changes daily so there is always something new and exciting to try.  Today's special was the Pesto Chicken and it was excellent.  The chef came out to make sure everything was good and chatted with us for a few minutes.    The food was so good that I was surprised there wasn't a line waiting to get in.  The cold weather must be keeping people from walking around much."}
