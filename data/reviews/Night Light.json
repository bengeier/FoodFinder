{"text":"Best burger in the O.P. hands down! Fire alarm burger mmmm.....it's in the old Wayne's Lounge / Mutzig's building for yinz old timers.  Hand made chips, fries, and burgers - always fresh never frozen."}
{"text":"This bar is bullshit when it comes to the food! I went in on my lunch break ordered a chicken salad and when order came it it was a pile of lettuce with a piece of chicken on top! No croutons, 2 tomatoes, No cheese, and little dressing that I had to ask for more of! I let the owner know that would it would be great to have croutons more tomatoes and cheese on my salad he said he would take care of it, so I come back in 2 weeks later and it was the same thing! I do not even go in the bar anymore because I gave them a chance to make it right, they did not, So good luck to all that have lunch there...."}
{"text":"This is the best burger in town. Fresh, made to order. Medium rare is actually medium rare. Lovely ambiance and Todd the bartender/server is very nice and professional. My children love the food too.  Absolutely best burger I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"We went to the Night Light the first month it was open (Nov 2016) and it certainly had some growing pains.  Half of the items were unavailable and the food was mediocre at best.  It has a nice location and it's been remodeled since it was Wayne's Lounge.   I am hoping it has or will improve."}
{"text":"Perfect atmosphere perfect food perfect mix drink perfect bartender  Lovely place to meet your friend and relaxin for couple hours"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with the wife on the day after Christmas. My bacon cheeseburger was good but not exceptional and my wife's cheeseburger egg rolls were pretty greasy. Overall, not terrible for a place that just opened, I'm sure we'll be giving them a second chance.  Nice atmosphere in the the table area, and the bar looked fun. Would be a great place to meet friends for a drink or seven, and I hope to do that soon. The place has a lot of potential and is a great addition to the Coraopolis bar/restaurant scene.  Big upgrade from Mutzig's or Wayne's."}
{"text":"Best local bar ever! The drinks are strong and delicious, the food is great for late nights, and when the Pens are playing, shots all around for a victory! And the service is top notch. Rachel is friendly and attentive. Come here any game night and you won't be disappointed."}
