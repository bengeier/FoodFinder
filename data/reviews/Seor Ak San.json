{"text":"LOVE the food here! 

Always amazing friendly service. The atmosphere is good it's a very simple place inside out but the food is killer! I always come here when I need my Korean food fix! 

The pork bone soup is awesome the meat basically falls of the bone! (Perfection) 

The Bibimbap is always my go to dish! It tastes like the best mothers home cooked meal! 

I love how they are always attentive to make sure you get your pickles and such at the beginning and how friendly and welcoming they are. Great place to go with a family, group, as a couple or alone!"}
{"text":"One of my go to Korean Food Restaurants downtown! I'm never disappointed when I go there, and the food always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I ordered a JaJangMyeon!! It was a large bowl of noodles but I managed to finish it cuz it's so tasty!!"}
{"text":"Don't expect atmosphere. No soft mood lighting, just harsh fluorescent ones. 

But expect decently-priced, quality food, and clean setting."}
{"text":"If you're looking for decent Korean food without having to venture up to Bloor & Christie or Yonge & Finch, Seor Ak San is the place to go. Located in Chinatown, the restaurant is actually quite spacious and clean. 

I ordered kam ja tang which came with a lot of meat and your typical veggies and potato chunk. You can choose your spice level: no spice, mild, regular, super spicy. I went with mild but this surprisingly had no kick at all - definitely going for regular spice at the very least next time.

My friend ordered jajangmyun (Korean black noodles dish). It looked and tasted great - when I come back I am going to get this dish!

The side dishes were only average - nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Seor Ak San is a great place to jump in and grab a quick meal. Among Ka Chi or Owl Minerva in Chinatown, this is one of the better places to get Korean food. Their food is on point and packed with full of flavour where each order is more than enough to satisfy even the hungriest of bellies. The portions are huge and everything is very tasty. As bonus,they also give 6-8 different banchan dishes! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Unassuming, no nonsense. Great food. Reasonable price. Hit the spot on a cold fall or winter day"}
{"text":"Best bibimbap in the city. Served on a beautiful brown rice. I find myself craving it at random times. I usually order take-out and it's ready very quickly. The service is very friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"There used to be a time when Ka-Chi is all I went for in Korean. 
But this place is coming up on the list fast. Been there three times already for lunch and their food is consistently good. ESP the Dolsot BibimBap is one of the best because their stone bowl stays hot and makes the rice crispy at the bottom as it should! Side dishes are good and the place is very friendly with fast service."}
{"text":"The Japchae and hot stone kimchi fried rice were delicious!  Very kind and helpful staff Side dishes were also quite tasty. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"There is a surprisingly limited number of Korean options in this area but I think this is the best one in Chinatown. Came here with a group and I ordered kimchi and vegetable stew, and we shared fried dumplings and seafood pancake. I always try to order the seafood pancake here - it's chock full of ingredients and always cooked perfectly crispy on both sides. The stew was delicious as well. A couple of my friends also ordered a stonepot udon which they raved about, so I will have to order that next time!"}
{"text":"This place is a real gem in Chinatown. Don't get put off by the basement location and zero atmosphere of the place.
The food is excellent and the prices are low !
Bibimbap is excellent here."}
{"text":"Came here on a late Sunday afternoon and the place was only serving a few other tables, so there was no wait. The place is clean and spacious, and the tables were very clean as well and comfortable.

We were first served bangchans which are always nice. The restaurant also plays a nice variety of Korean music, which wasn't the mainstream stuff so it was nice to hear new music.

Saw that they had cheese deokbokki so we ordered one of those with no spice, a kalbi tang and a half platter of donkotsu. The cheese deokbokki was still flavourful with spice and the pulling melting cheese was fun. The rice cakes were chewy and the texture was perfect. The vegetables in it (onions, nappa) etc were tender. Kalbi tang had a ton of ribs and radish and the broth was delightfully white. Donkotsu was very thin and crisp, served with shredded lettuce topped with hot sauce."}
{"text":"English will follow
Délicieux, pas cher, propre, meilleur resto coréen que je connaisse!

Je suis tombée sur cette perle par hasard, et ma foi, prochaine fois que je vais a Toronto, j'y retourne. J'ai commandé un plat sur un plaque chauffante qui était très bon. Ils offrent aussi des plats dans des bols en pierre chauffée. Leurs plats sont arômatisés à l'huile de sésame. Il faut absolument goûter à leurs nouilles élastiques qui sont fait à base de patate (oui vraiment!).

En plus, c'est vraiment pas cher! Moins que 10 $.
____

Delicious, cheap, clean,  best Korean restaurant I know.
I came across this gem by chance, and next time I come to Toronto, I will return to this restaurant. I ordered a sizzling dish that was very good. They also offer dishes in heated stone bowls. Their dishes are flavored with sesame oil. You must try their  noodles made rom potatoes (yes really!).

Plus, it is really cheap! Less than $10."}
{"text":"This easy to miss spot on Spadina is home to the better if not the best korean food in the downtown area. It's my favourite at least. 

They have pretty much all the staples you'd come to expect: bibimbap (hot stone and regular varieties), fired chicken, rice cakes, pork bone soup, and my personal favourite the soondobu (which I like here more than buk chang dong soon tofu). Most dishes hover between the $8-$12 range and the portions are enough to leave you satisfied.

Some down points can be the service can be slow at times, and recently they've been putting out less appetizers (they used to put out 6 and have since reduced it to 4). But these are minor knocks for me, as the food and price point make up for it.

Ordered: Soondobu (usually)
Price: $8.99 + tax
Final thought: Slightly smaller portion than what you may get at buk chang dong soon but no less tasty"}
{"text":"I had the boo-deh-chi-gae and my friend had the dumplings.  They were really good!  And the stew was packed with meats, tofu and kimchi!  I liked the 6 side dishes they gave us... very tasty and they were very willing to give us seconds (for free).  The service was extremely friendly and attentive.  I looked around and even though it's in a basement in China town, it was so clean and the décor was simple and neat.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The worst korean restaurant I been in my life and the services and there pork bone soup is freaking suck and I would never go back there again. The owner is freaking racist too."}
{"text":"Good soups. Probably the best korean place in the area. Very easy to walk by without noticing ."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the most authentic Korean restaurants in Toronto and I'm half Korean so I've had my fair share of Korean food. The waiters here are extremely nice, one of them even said \"Long time no see\" when I hadn't come for a week because of midterms. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised but not completely impressed. We came as a group of three and ordered 3 dishes: chicken bulgogi bibimbab, kimchi seafood pancake, and rabokki. Food came out fairly quickly (around 10 mins) and we received the banchans when the dishes came out. 

Banchans included marinated potatoes, kimchi, japchae, and bean sprouts. I usually judge a Korean restaurant by its kimchi and I have to say that this place's kimchi was a little to sweet for my taste. The japchae and marinated potatoes were excellent. I was surprised at how well marinated the potatoes were despite them being in large chunks. 

The chicken bulgogi bibimbab and rabokki were just average but the kimchi seafood pancake is what stood out. It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. There was a satisfying crunch in every bite and the flavors were completely spot on. Do get the pancakes when you go!

Overall, an amazing place for cheap and filling Korean food (we were all stuffed when we left). However, don't expect the best presentation. Service was excellent despite the low price. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Bibimbap is their best dish, imo. Lots of (fresh) toppings. It's the only thing I order from there anymore. Their dishes have generous servings, and when my friend asked for a side dish not normally given, they came out with it (I've never seen it served there before!). So, I'd say service is very good, but I've never been there while it's very busy. Pretty good for a Korean place not in Koreatown. Go to Bloor if you can, but if you're around UT or Chinatown for whatever reason, this place is solid."}
{"text":"Favorite, my go-to korean place in the spadina area. I've come with all different groups of friends and they like it as well.

Service is always friendly, and quick for me.

Staple favorites of mine are the kamjatang (Pork Bone Soup), Bibimbap, and kimchi bokumbap. Also, when I'm in a splurgy mood I'll get the kimchi seafood pancake.

I've had the ramen, rice cakes in spicy sauce(dduk bokki), kalbi, most of the stews, and the table bbq, and they were decent. (The table bbq was a bit on the dry side for my liking)

The complimentary side dishes are always awesome, especially the potatoes, and chapchae (glass noodles). I like these more than some of the dishes I mentioned above."}
{"text":"No better way to celebrate a Jays win then with a bottle of soju and delicious food.

I always judge Korean places by their kimchi and some good fermented cabbage is served up here.

I wasn't blown away by the pork bone soup. The meat was nice, but I found the soup to be lacking.

The LA ribs were bomb though. The sauce had me licking the bone.

We had some chicken dumplings just for filler which were standard.

The prices and friendly service will definitely have me come back to try other items."}
{"text":"Cheap AND good does exist!!

Been here a half dozen times already and never disappoints.

The lady there is always polite and courteous and service is always good. Food comes pretty fast.

Place is nice and spacious and you're not hitting elbows with strangers like some places...which I F-ing hate!

This time we ordered the beef AND chicken dumplings (fried not steamed). Cheap and tasty ($6.75 for 10 pieces).

Also had the spicy kalbi ribs (#61 on the menu) which is better than sliced bread!!! I order this EVERY time I go here. Great flavour and has a nice kick.

For the \"main\" we had the classic pork bone soup which was very good. They give 3 large meaty pieces. Even though I was ready to explode I want to eat more of it.

The ONLY thing that I can complain about, which is not a big deal, are the metal chopsticks. They are flat, not round, like traditional ones and kinda heavy towards the end of the meal. But they also offer disposable wooden ones so not even a complaint but more like a...tip."}
{"text":"Aaaaamazing.  We were served super fast and got a ton of banchan (that they even offered to refill, even though there were only two of us! Very generous.)  The portions were huge; I ordered the chicken bulgogi and had enough left for a big lunch the next day.  Plus the food was delicious! It was pretty quiet the night we went, so we didn't have any trouble getting seated or served, but I understand this place is popular and service might be slower on weekends."}
{"text":"Too rude and unkind
Especially the serving girl.
Nobody cares what you eat and what you feel with the foods"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a place to eat lunch during our break and found Seor Ak San.

We ordered ja jeung mein (which is a bean and meat sauce mixture on noodles), kamjatang and bi bim bap and we were happy they were all on their lunch special menu. After ordering, a bunch of side dishes came out and they were nice enough to give us double of everything since we had 8 people. Food was very yummy, and soo worth the money we spent!

Atmosphere-wise, it is a very spacious restaurant so feel free to come with large groups of people. Servers are nice and they also allow you to pay for the bill separately which is great for people with no cash (aka me). They also don't rush you out which was great for us because we tend to linger after our meals and take our time leaving. 

I think my friends and I have found our new go-to place!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with good food and quick service. However I got (several) hairs in my bowl of rice. What a shame"}
{"text":"Really liked the food, fast service. Satisfied my craving for Korean food! You can ask for mild spice thankfully so we got to eat the cheese ddukboki (toppoki as I learned in Japan)."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews, got all hyped up and decided to drag another one of my dates for a tasting.

Although everyone was raving about the bimbimbap, I decided to have the Pork bone soup since I had a craving for it.

As everyone mentioned, the apetizers they brought over did not disappoint. It was generous portions and delicious.

The pork bone soup came in the usual piping hot stone bowl. The flavor was exquisite. I ordered regular spicy. The pork morsels were very tender and flavorful. By far the best pork bones soup i've had in this city hands down. 

The price was the usual. The bill was approximately $20 for 2 people. The service was good and fast.  I went during a Sunday night so there was no wait to be seated.

I highly recommend this place. You won't regret trying it."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I love korean food and I am easy to please with korean food but this place was not satisfying for me. The price was also higher in relation to the food and the atmosphere. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Gam ja tang (pork bone soup) was good, though a little on the mild side. We asked for it spicy the second time and it was better. I also tried the dolsot bibimbap with chicken, which was excellent. Not much chicken, but that's the way I prefer it. Kimchis were of good variety and quality, service was good. Really unexpectedly good for Chinatown."}
{"text":"Food portion is good, and can be considered as cheap place to eat.
The taste is above average, but just not the best I have tried."}
{"text":"Hahah of course both my friend and I ordered the pork bone soup. 

Spicy is the way to go!

I was looking forward to the side dishes but they weren't THAT great or anything. I liked the unique spinach pancake thing, as well as the japchae, but portions seemed small and we had to get refills twice! Also, the potato one wasn't as good as other places, where they've been just pure caramelized goodness (like Buk Chang Dong). 

But: the pork bones had plenty of tender meat and it was very flavourful. Perfect for a winter day."}
{"text":"Not really sure why this place has such high reviews. My friend and I ordered the hot pot which was basically meat and vegetables in a sugar soup. So gross!

We also had a side of potato pancakes which tasted like really oily hash browns. That tasted good but it's really hard to mess up fried potatoes. At least they managed to withhold putting sugar in this dish!"}
{"text":"Tasty Korean food in the heart of Chinatown. My favourite dishes are the tofu stew and bibimbap. Attentive service and a nice variety of complimentary appetizer dishes. This and Ka Chi on St. Andrew street are my go-to Korean places in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Seor Ak San = Huge mountain in western Korea, which is a beautiful breath-taking place but the restaurant doesn't live up to the attraction of its namesake as the foods turned out to be mountain of disappointment! This is another restaurant I made trek to after checking out ratings on Yelp, and after successful experience at the other restaurant I had visited based on Yelp rating I had high hopes. 

Me and my gal pal shared bibimbop and spicy tofu soup. Bibimbop was alright but not 4-star worthy in my book. I don't understand the praise, ie someone called it the best bibimbop in Toronto, as I didn't particularly find it special. The tofu soup was ok too but again it wasn't anything to write home about. It was tad bit salty for me though. Banchan was ok, but kimchi could be better as it tasted too sour for me. 

The menu is a sight to behold, which managed to cram every single Korean dish known to western world. I might come back for porkbone soup, which I'm not a fan of but people around me have nothing but good words to say about it."}
{"text":"Past the hustle and bustle of Chinatown lies Seor Ak San.  
Ordered #89 Dolsat BiBimBap.  There is a lunch special but I wanted it in a hot stone pot so I ordered off the regular menu.   $8.99
Side dishes are passable, but the BiBimBap is delish."}
{"text":"One of the better Korean restaurants I've been to. Definitely try the spicy short ribs if you can handle the heat - or you can suffer like I did (so worth it though).

I believe my spicy ribs were about $12.49 with complementary side dishes that you share. Rice included.

Service is prompt and friendly. Will come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Good Korean food though a bit pricey. Love the side dishes, hate the music.  Number 82 is my staple."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, portions were generous, our order arrived promptly and tasted excellent - perfect dolsot bibimbop, succulent kalbi short ribs and a satisfying pork bone soup. Would recommend to anyone looking for quality, affordable Korean fare on the west end."}
{"text":"This place has great Korean food for a relatively inexpensive price. I've been to places where they would charge way more than Seor Ak San and virtually serve the same plate. The restaurant decor isn't over the top and there are interesting pictures around the walls to look at.
When my sister and I went in, there was at least a good half of the restaurant served and eating and it was a Friday afternoon. The owners or people who served us are definitely not Korean but that's only a side note. The service was fast!! I ordered udon noodles with spicy beef and my sister got the pork chop bibimbap, both of which came in steaming hot stone bowls. Ten minutes after we put in our order, the food came out. The food was clean, hot and wonderful to eat. Personally, my noodles could have used some more sauce but I made that up when eating the various and typical sides they gave us with my meal. My sister's food was just as delicious and there are no complaints."}
{"text":"It's changed since it opened. The prices are more expensive. would you pay $11.50 for pork bone soup? I didn't think so."}
{"text":"My friend is in love with this restaurant's BiBimBap, so I was happy to tag along for a lunch around 3pm on a weekday. The entrance is located below the sidewalk, so you need to take stairs, which may make it difficult to find. When we arrived, what seemed like students were leaving, so we were the only ones dining at the time. We were greeted by a nice lady who gave us lots of time deciding and the tea we were served was just the right temperature. If you're into K-Pop, then their music playlist will add to the enjoyment of your experience.

We both ordered BiBimBap (kimchi and bulgogi) as well as their Ddukbokki. It was my first time trying the later and it was amazing! The rice cakes were soft and chewy and the spicy sauce was not too salty or spicy. The dish also included glass noodles and what I believe to be cabbage. As for the BiBimBap, the meat was seasoned/marinated to taste and all the vegetables were fresh. I especially enjoyed the purple rice and the bottle of extra sauce that I sadly don't know the name of. The portions for each dish were filling, but the side dishes could use a little more. 

I don't remember the cost for each of the dishes, but for the two of us, the total came out to $38 including tax. They only pull out the machine if it is more than $20. This price is definitely alright with me since there were three dishes to belly filling portions. 

Also, while we were dining, many people seem to come here instead for take-out. They, and we, didn't wait long for our food, so I'd say service is pretty quick. 

I wouldn't say this place is as amazing as my friend claims, but I would surely come here again to eat Korean food."}
{"text":"It is okay... Nothing terrible but nothing particularly good either.  Only feel the need to write a review because I'm not sure where the four stars come from.  There are many, many better Korean restaurants in Koreatown..."}
{"text":"Had the grilled fish and soft tofu combination entree. Good flavor and portions. Veggie offerings were a little limited but satisfying. Would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Wee went for dinner and the Korean food was outstanding. The food was made quickly but did not appear old or stale. Instead it was very tasty and fresh. I would feinting come back the next time I'm in the area. The spicy beef hot pot was an excellent choice as was the spicy chicken hot pot."}
{"text":"Yelp wins again! While I am a veteran of the Korean places along Yonge St and Christie, I had never thought of venturing to Chinatown for Korean food. And never would I set foot into a basement restaurant unless I could be certain of their food! For all you other sub-ground-food-phobic folks, don't worry. It's good here.

Big pluses: prompt service, the waitress has everything brought to your table by the time you descend their steps and open the door. GIANT tea pot (really shiny)! You'll never have to ask for a refill. A slew of side dishes, something for everyone! And, definitely not least, DERICIOUS SOON DUBU!!!! (err...Tofu, just going with the Seoraksanese pronunciation)

I found their Kamjatang not as good as I've had at other places. Its sour hint was really strong. But try the Soon Tofu here, I would say it's one of the best flavours I have ever tried. 

Atmosphere - 2.5/5
Service - 3/5
Food - 5/5
Price - 5/5"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, but the service not so much. 

I highly recommend the seafood pancake and the beef bibambap (washed down with a bottle or two of Hite, of course) -- but be prepared to wait in case you are one of the ones whose order they completely forget.

With one guy serving the entire PACKED restaurant and not writing down people's orders it's amazing we got anything we asked for right. As it was, he forgot to bring us our Hites, and then later my bibambap (all the while I had to sit and watch as everyone who came in after me received plate after plate of deliciously sizzling food. Agony!)

I would go back and give them a second try as I thought the food was really tasty, but my friend would not. She said its better on Bloor street, and that next time we're craving Korean she'd take me to her favourite spots there."}
{"text":"I practically live here since I live around the corner. I am truly fortunate to live in such close proximity to so many fantastic restaurants. But when Seor Ak San opened, every other place almost faded into the background. A small, family run business, they provide incredibly fast and courteous service, great banchan, and even tastier mains. Great prices and hilarious k-pop always brighten my day. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I've tried all the signature Korean dishes here but I wasn't exactly impressed. They are definitely not bad, but not good enough to keep me coming back for them. The only thing that I am in love with at this place is their Pa jun pancake."}
{"text":"I remember coming here last year because someone recommended me this place. Food was okay. Service was terrible. And when I paid for my food, the total came to $9. I put down a $10 and waited several minutes and I didn't get my change. Have to go up to the counter and request for my change. The server said \"this doesn't include the tip.\" So left the $1 on the counter and walked out feeling disgusted. It is a real turn off for me anytime someone demands for a tip and not even giving me back my change and I have to go up to the counter to request for it. I don't like place that demands for a tip."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group of girlfriends for dinner, and we had a really good time. On Spadina (at about Baldwin) This place offers up really Good, cheap Korean Food.  Hearty Seafood Pancake, Impressive Banchan spread and hot or cold tea. Spicy Bulgogi on hot plate (#63) was so good we ordered a second. Kimchi Chiggae is delicious and just the right amount of spice and sour. Friendly staff were obsessively cleaning the restaurant throughout the visit, which pleases me. Must go back to try the soontofu!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend for a birthday lunch and the food here is amazing, price is so reasonable and the people were sooo sweet. 

I ordered the black bean noodles and pan fried beef dumplings. Noodles were a bit mild but that's how I like it so no complaints! My friend got the beef and kimchi hot pot and seafood pancake. Gotta say, if you're the exploding flavour loving type go for the kimchi. Seafood pancakes were delishhhh too!"}
{"text":"The place is a hole in the wall.  I had passed by so many times without coming in, and finally want to give it a try after reading the positive review here.  Tried their stew, and while their stew taste good and portion is decent, but nothing special or distinctive.  It also lacks the depth as some of my favour places.  So does banchan, it tastes ok but not as flavourful.  The pancake is good tho, and they use purple rice.  The service is friendly, no complaint here.  Price is reasonable.  Overall a good place to visit when I'm in the area and crave for hangover meal.  3.5/5"}
{"text":"It is located on east side of Spadina and you walk down a few steps below walking level. The place is casual and accommodates small and larger tables of 6. We were a party of 5 adults for dinner on a Sunday evening.  We shared the dumplings which were crispy and hot. Then we eat had our own entrees. I had the Hot Stone Pot Bibimbap with spicy chicken. It was hot, flavourful and very yummy. The spicy chicken wasn't too spicy, just right. Two people had the Hot Stone Pot Bibimbap came with Beef short ribs (5 or more pieces), which looked really good as well. One person had a plate of the beef short ribs with a bowl of the purple rice and the last person in our party had the Stir fried Noodles with chewy Rice cakes, fish cakes, vegetables in hot paste. The portions for all the dishes were a good size and everything hot and flavourful. We will come again."}
{"text":"First experience with Korean food and damn was it amazing. 

I often walked by this delicious smelling place on my way to Mashion Bakery and  when I finally remembered the name of it to look it up, I was pleasantly surprised at all the positive reviews. 

Well my fiance and I finally were able to drag our butts down here and boy, was it worth it. We walked in and were seated immediately by the very efficient waiter, who set us up with menus and a big pot of tea. We spent quite a bit of time perusing the menu since we had no idea what to order (food n00bs lol) but when we did, it was about five minutes before we got our food. By far the fastest service I've received in a sit down restaurant ever!

I got the spicy shrimp bibimbap and my fiance got this chicken bulgogi or something like that whose name eludes me lolol. Of course we began stuffing our faces immediately, along with the complimentary appetizers. Speaking of which, the only one we didn't like was these green stringy things that were chewy...everything else we loved, especially the kimchi!

For our first foray into Korean food, it was pretty damn good. The vegetables on my bibimbap were definitely fresh and the shrimp was actually spicy, unlike what I usually find in restaurants. I sampled my fiance's food too, and I preferred it over my own! XD He liked it too, but underestimated just how spicy it would be. 

Overally, I'd definitely come back again. For two people it was about twenty dollars, very reasonable and the food was very filling. There's nothing I hate more than paying for a lot of food and then being hungry an hour later and the food here definitely isn't like that lol!"}
{"text":"Not sure the quality is go down or it has been overrated on yelp, i come to try because it was highest rate for Korean Food in China town. I would say \"Very disappointed\". I order pork bone soup, the taste is okay, the broth is not rich at all, and i felt the soup is lack of heat. I had tried pork bone soup at many Korean restaurants, and i think i won't come back again."}
{"text":"Seor Ak San, continues to be consistent and reliable for me. 

Not only was the main order good, had ordered a tofu soup with beef this time, but the side dishes (potato, green beans, kimchi, pancake) are equally good!

The service is ok. I never needed to ask more than to place the order or get the bill. 

The food was brought to the table in a reasonable amount of time. About 12 mins or so from placement of the order."}
{"text":"The past reviews make it hard not to have high expectations for Seor Ak San. Somehow they didn't disappoint even my inflated expectations! Automatic star awarded! =)

The orders were for bibimbap which was a great mix of quality of veggies and quantity of the veggies. I found that the egg ($0.50 if you don't order the beef bibimbap) was a bit over cooked and came to be food well done which made it difficult to mix it into the rest of the dish (they charge $1 extra to eat from the stone bowl). 
Banchan served was very good in both quality and quantity, they serve a slightly sweet/spicy kimchi rather than the usual spicy and sour kimchi which I thought was interesting. additionally they serve fresh seaweed which is different that other korean places I've been to. 

The eating environment is a mixture of radio top 40 and student chatter, very different from the other places I've been to, but considering their location and target customer it isn't surprising.

I would definitely go here again, though if I had a metropass I would probably head over to koreatown for a stonebowl version...

They accept Visa and Mastercard for orders over $10."}
{"text":"A friend and I were undecided on what we wanted to try that we hadn't eaten in a while.  A stroll down Spadina Ave in the heart of Chinatown ironically landed us in a Korean Restaurant.  

The place is partially hidden from from street view, and given the fact it was boxing day it wasn't very busy.  We had the whole place to ourselves and wondered if they were closing.   However; we warmly welcomed by this family run business. 

There isn't much to the decor in this place.  It's quite simple with a few pictures of some dishes on the wall and standard tables and chairs.  The impression was that the place was clean...very clean.  This was very comforting considering some of the restaurants I have eaten at in Chinatown.

We were provided with a large pot of green tea while we contemplated our menu choices. My friend ordered the bibimbap with spicy shrimp and I ordered the Korean BBQ short ribs.  

Our appetizers arrived, fried tofu, kimchi, potato,  sprouts, spicy sprouts and glass noodle. Delicious!!!  

The bibimbap and the ribs were promptly delivered fresh and sizzling from the kitchen.  I couldn't wait to dig in.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with my ribs.  They were tasty but extremely chewy.   The bibimbap was just delicious!    

Check out the flicks.   I would definitely come back again, only I may not get the ribs again."}
{"text":"Ordered tuna kimchi soon chigae and it was delicious. Service was find, they gave us our space and were cordial. They place could use some decorating but that doesn't take away from the food. I've had soon tofu from a bunch of places but the broth was one of the best at this place. Side dishes were yummy, though one (pancake one I believe) was a bit greasy. Great menu options with amazing prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Affordable Korean Restaurant.  It's literally as good as it gets.

This is a restaurant that I eat my lunch with friends, almost every week.

They serve consistently good dishes although you will see about 100 dishes on the menu.

I'm originally from S.Korea but still surprised about the quality of the dishes here.

Honestly, all dishes that they make is good but here are some dishes that I eat frequently.

1. Bibimbap:  All ingredients are very fresh. Simply great. 
I order stew(chigae) to go with bibimbap because I think both dishes together.....is just a master piece. 
Something simple stew like kimchi chigae,Yookgaejang, or Dak Gaejang. 
Google them if you dont know what these stews are. They are just hearty and so warming.

2. Fried Kimchi and Pork (Jaeyook kimchi, Menu number 29 and 68,  $7.95, $10.95) : they serve this dish either on a hot plate or regular one. probably the best Fried Kimchi Pork that I had. Warning: Very addictive.  

3. Sweet and Sour chicken (Kan Poong Ki, Menu number 72) : served with rice. nicely fried with tasty batter, not greasy, has good texture. the sauce that it's coated with is very tasty. I avoid fried food but this is such a delicious dish, Sour and sweet  is well balanced.

Also, for appetizers, the pancake menus are really good. You should definitely order them if you arrive there hungry or plan to have a big meal."}
{"text":"Seor Ak San is a bare bones dinner spot which serves amazing food! We got there around 8 pm. There werent too many people at the restaurant that night. 

We got the pork bone soup (as recommended by several yelpers), the seafood pancake, the spicy bulgogi and the bibimbap with egg. All the dishes were well prepared. I wasnt a big fan of the pork bone soup. We will definitely return when we have a bibimbap craving!"}
{"text":"All I can say is you get every bang for your buck. The portions are amazing for the price. Absolutely satisfying. Flavorful yet simple. Hip but still cultured. This place is awesome and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered a combo of Jajiang noodle and Korean style crispy spicy chicken. Jajiang noodle has same flavour like some kinds of Korean instant noodle and the crispy spicy chicken is not crispy at all."}
{"text":"Came here around 5:30 on a Sunday for an early dinner. Not that busy. I ordered tofu seafood soup while my boyfriend got the pork bone soup. Side dishes were alright, nothing special. The soup was hot but the broth for both of our meals was very salty. My tofu soup did not have that much in it, only some squid and minimal tofu. The bill came to $20 plus tip. Pretty average pricing and average food. The servers didn't come to fill our side dishes or tea on their own. But they were quick once we called them over. Overall, the experience was average but,  there are so many korean restaurants in Chinatown. This one can be skipped"}
{"text":"I had almost the exact opposite experience of some of the recent reviewers of this place. I was impressed with the service but disappointed with the food. 

SERVICE - Our waiter was incredibly attentive and polite and everything was brought out quite quickly. My friend and I were chatting for a long time without ordering anything after we were done our meal and he seemed to have no problem letting us sit there until we asked for the bill. While the decor could be slightly less cheesy, the atmosphere was decent, especially for a Monday night. 

FOOD - I had very high hopes given the reviews of this place but I left underwhelmed. The miso soup lacked any real punch and was overloaded with green onions. It couldn't even live up to the relatively low standards of something you might expect to get at a Japanese restaurant as part of an $8 lunch special. The banchan (Korean appetizers) were similarly lacking flavour. I wished that the various pickled vegetables had more of the strong flavour of the juices that were used to pickle them. Furthermore, the two non-pickled dishes (a potato and omelette-like concoction) were cold and seemed very out of place. Finally, I tried the bibimbap with beef. Like the dishes that preceded it, it simply lacked any kick. The beef was barely seasoned and so I was left with a bunch of tasteless beef and raw vegetables. In addition, the rice and beef were lukewarm, making the entire dish a rather unpleasant temperature. 

After trying some of the places on Bloor, I don't think I would come back here again."}
{"text":"I have been going here every now and then for lunch for the past couple years. 

My absolute FAVOURITE Pork Bone Soup I've ever had in Toronto. Nice broth and good quality meat, the bones have a lot of meat yet it is still very tender! I find other places I have tried never get a good balance of both...

 I can't comment on the other dishes as I always go for the pork bone soup.

Fast and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"I've only had Korean food on a small handful of occasions and I am taking a strong liking to it! I came here with a group of friends on a Saturday night. It was pretty quiet around 6:30pm, maybe because it was early? Maybe because it was super cold that night! I definitely wanted to warm up with a hot stone bowl of bibimbap. It was piping hot when it came out. It took a long while for it to cool down, which was fine since I was busy enjoying appetizers over conversation. Everyone enjoyed their meal, the food tasted fresh and I love all the sides they provide you. It's like a feast. I would come here again if in the area, but I prefer the bibimbap I had in Koreatown because there was less cabbage. They put a lot of cabbage in this one and it made all the rice turn purple. This is a great spot though for a quick meal and would recommend :)"}
{"text":"I came by here to try the best bibimbap in town from all the Yelp reviews.  The place is in Chinatown so I was expecting dingy but it wasn't to bad at all.  It's located in the basement of the building and has been renovated fairly nicely.  Nothing fancy but definitely newer and clean.

So we ordered our meal and they brought out all the little extra things that make eating at Korean restaurants awesome.  I liked all the dishes but the stand outs were the kimchi and the glass noodles...especially the glass noodles.  They were very tasty!

My spicy chicken bibimbap came out and I mixed it up added some hot sauce and dug in!  MISTAKE!  Never dig into this thing as it's piping hot!  The bibimbap is excellent and definitely one of the best I've had in Toronto and actually one of the best I've had in Canada.

Is it possible to get your bibimbap even spicier?  I tried to add more hot sauce and that didn't kick it up a notch.  The only thing that sucked was the service but the food is definitely excellent!"}
{"text":"My sister and I were touring Toronto for the weekend and were in search of a top notch Korean restaurant. We were very impressed! The staff were friendly and helpful, the food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. We order Bibimbap hot plate and bowl, and were thrilled with our picks. Would highly recommend this place. 

Side note: The music is eclectic and unexpectedly fun."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork bone soup, mild spicy and it was delicious.  I might try the regular spicy next time. Usually not a fan of bean sprouts but for some reason I didn't mind them in the soup. I woke up really thirsty the next day so probably a bit more salt that I'm used to."}
{"text":"I discovered this place by chance, it's kind of hidden. I'm so glad I did though, it has become my new favourite korean spot. Everything tastes amazing! I'm constantly craving it. 5/5 for taste and service !"}
{"text":"A neat little find in chinatown! 

Pros: 
- cheap and delicious (for a broke college student like me, this is ideal) 
- large portion for dishes that only cost $~7
- great service 
- no line-ups, short wait-time for the food to get on the table
- their side-dishes (appetizers) are the best ones in Central Toronto Area. 

Cons:
- spice level varies with dish, but then again, it's just personal preference.

I am a frequent customer, and it has become tradition to order their Beef Kimchi Tofu Stew. The tofu melts on the tongue and the stew is always brought to me hot and steaming, it's really perfect for the winter time. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Even though I felt bad that I was the only person in the entire restaurant (I went in at 3PM), they made me feel welcome and sent me full of delicious, delicious pork bulgogi. So very delicious."}
{"text":"- fast service
- good prices
- great bibimbob!"}
{"text":"This place is a good place to eat if you want decent Korean food.

Ive tried the Bimbimbop and Soon tofu from here and remember being quite satisfied. The side dishes were nothing to write home about but were ok. 

This place would be my second choice to grab food if my first choice was packed and If I was really craving decent K-food.

My rating is 4.1"}
{"text":"If you are serious with Pork Bone Soup as me, this resturant is not for you. However, if you are super hungry, looking for a large potion of food with good price, this is one of the option for you."}
{"text":"I mean, the food definitely is worth trying. The staff are very kind and explain things to you if you ask them. My wife and I didn't know the first thing about Korean food but thanks to their staff's patience, we ended up choosing some really good food!"}
{"text":"Great place for cheap, fast, no frills korean food. Majority of the people who dine here like the kam ja tang (pork bone soup) and for $8.85 you can't go wrong. But I prefer the dol sot bibimbap (stone hot mixed rice dish) with spicy pork and the kimchi jjigae. Two people can dine here for $25 with tax and tip. Expect to get 6 side dishes.

Bonus for those who don't know korean food well - there's lots of pictures with English translation."}
{"text":"Unassuming little basement eatery with reasonable prices and great food. We come here way too often. I usually get the bibimbap in the hot stone bowl, or the soondubu."}
{"text":"I am no expert on Korean food but Seor Ak San certainly delivered. Opted to come here as it was closer than the Bloor Korean spots, and was not disappointed. We saw the metal spoons and chopsticks and knew we were in the right place. 

Ordered:
- sweet and sour pork half platter $7ish
- famous pork bone soup $7ish
- jap chae

Service was prompt and friendly. We got a wide array of side dishes which were delicious. The  pork bone soup was hearty and perfect for a cold winter's day. They definitely did not hold back on the meat, which fell apart from the bone effortlessly. It had veggies like bean sprouts and one piece of potato, and was served alongside a bowl of purple rice and a bowl to discard the bones. The jap chae was flavourful. The sweet and sour pork was crispy and hit the spot. Contrary to the Chinese version, the batter is thicker and the meat is sliced thinly so it looks like French fries. 

Would come back again!"}
{"text":"My default Korean stop if I'm on Spadina. The stews and kalbi is good. Can't compare it to places like sariwon or piggy, but good compared to the area it's in."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Seor Ak San. Even though they get recommended for Bibimbap I was in the mood for some Kalbi (Beef Rib) and the spicy version was mentioned quite a bit on Yelp so I went for it. Ordering was effortless as I knew exactly what I wanted.
The banchan arrived quickly and was a nice variety. Some were OK some were hohum. I would like to point out they were not refilled as is the case with other Korean places. Never mind I didn't come here for banchan. The spicy Kalbi arrived in  a reasonable amount of time and had nice sizzle going which made a lot of patrons look up.
Initial impression was good, nice sauce covering the meat which is served on a hot plate on bed of onions. Nicely dotted with some sesame seeds. 
First few bites made a good impression and it was very good version of this dish. However I was still hungry as the portion was not enough for me. Sensing this the server brought me a bowl of rice that helped a bit.
So 3.5 Stars  overall as I would like to come back and try their Bibimbap."}
{"text":"Brought my Korean bf to try this place out and both him and I weren't that fond of this place. I forgot what he ordered, but I got the not spicy dukkbokki with beef, and it was drowning in sauce. I think they must have flavoured the sauce with ramyun seasoning or something, cause that's what it tasted like and I was reaaallly thirsty afterwards. (Also I've learnt from watching Korean shows that they believe that adding ramyun seasoning to all soups and sauces will make it better, which wasn't the case here).The banchans are horrid in my opinion. Everything seemed store bought to me, with the exception of the pancake which was perhaps the single redeeming factor. Perhaps dating a korean and hanging out in korea town all the time has raised my standards, but for me personally the experience was really disappointing. I was looking forward to eating here too because of the great reviews. Oh well. Probably won't return, there are better korean lunch places downtown I'm sure."}
{"text":"I come here mainly for one thing. Their large hotpot of Pork Bone Soup. It says it serves 2, but really, it probably serves more like 3 people. It's a large, hot, boiling wok of spicy broth with hunks of pork bones. Don't order this however if you're squeamish about gnawing on bones.

Their bibimbap isn't as good as Buk Chang Dong, but it's decent.

Last time I went I ordered the japchae with beef, and the fried beef dumplings. Both were very delicious.

Love that they include glass noodles in the taster dishes.

My order usually comes to about $15 not including any alcohol, although my male dining companions were excited for the $3.50 domestic beers, and the $4.50 hite!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute jewel in terms of Korean food downtown (other than the Christie area). The side-dishes are dishes and ample - I would strongly recommend their excellent seaweed side. Some of the others that I have tried and loved are: gamjatang, broiled mackerel, yukgaejang, and of course the excellent seafood pancake (but that comes already with the sides)."}
{"text":"What's going on here?  Slowly, this place is just going down in the ranks.  In terms of quality, quantity, and price, I might actually have to venture up to Bloor and Christie.

Soon tofu had like no ingredients other than tofu.  Pretty sad actually.  The pork bone soup was spicy, but not all that flavourful.  The spicy seafood noodle soup was a sizeable portion, but the noodles were a tad overcooked.  The only dish I felt was worth 4 stars was the dolsot bibimbap.  As for the banchan, you're only allowed one additional reorder.  I was sad I couldn't get a third plate of kimchi.  

Still decent if you can't get to Bloor, but I think it might be worth the time and effort to hit up K-town."}
{"text":"YUMMY Kimchi Seafood Pancake!
I have to say that Bcoz I love it! Actually, I don't really eat Korean pancake if its not free ;P but I would love to pay for this one! Come and try it! If you don't look for a fancy restaurant, this is another good one for filling your stomach..^^"}
{"text":"Food is 5-star awesome. 

Review is for one of the 3 waitering staff (the tall bigger guy working on Sat night Oct 14, 2017). This guy has an unfriendly grumpy attitude who thinks he owns the place! I have been to this place over 50 times over the last 4 yrs. This is the 4th time he's served our table with the same horrible attitude i.e. doesn't greet, takes your order in a condescending manner, responds to you in the harshest hap hazard fashion possible, etc.  

Service with the previous 2 waitresses (they were there until May/ June of this year) was fantastic - they were friendly, greeted you as you entered, said good bye when you left and provided great service. Owners need to coach/ sort this particular waiter out else you'll be loosing me as a customer as well as plenty others I'm sure! He is damaging your restaurant's reputation as I've come to enjoy over the past 4 years."}
{"text":"I love this. A favorite lunch spot of mine. Always good food and good service when I've gone :)"}
{"text":"We ordered the Stir Fried Pork Bulgogi with Vegetables on Rice, and the Stir Fried Rice with Kimchi and Chicken. Both came to around $23, which was an excellent deal because the dishes were massive and we were super full by the end of it. 

The pork was tender and full of flavour. Even though I'm not a fan of onions in particular, the sauce was so tasty I didn't really care! They don't skimp on the meat portions either. 

As for the kimchi fried rice,  it had a nice kick, but there wasn't a lot of chicken. This is definitely a good dish for sharing (along with another main or two). 

Overall, really glad we stopped by here for lunch. Service was prompt and friendly, food was excellent, and it's worth re-visiting for sure!"}
{"text":"Dishes I recommend: PBS and bibimbap. 
Dishes tried and do not recommend: jajianmang and spicy Kimchi soup 

The service is friendly and fast. Plenty of side dishes that are refillable, however the quality are not the best.

Would return to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Korean food and I found this place a little disappointing. I ordered a Yukejang and it had the toughest meat I've ever had in korean cooking. The portion was generous and the soup was ok but the meat was so terrible I didn't even want to eat it. I also tried the chicken ramen noodle which was so much better and the protein was good in that dish. The banchans are plentiful and the waitresses are nice but not sure I would come back because yukejang is such a staple that they didn't do quite right..."}
{"text":"I was craving for korean food and I was too lazy to venture to korean town. Made a stop here instead. Craving was satisfied.  Food tasted great. Service was good."}
{"text":"Pork bone soup was really good but meat could be more tender.

 Spicy rice cakes were good but could be spicier and more flavourful. 

Seafood pancake was good and super crispy, if you like that."}
{"text":"Yummy and cheap!  Been here a few times and has been pretty consistent.  I frequent this place with my grandparents who looooooove yummy and especially CHEAP!  Lol.  I usually get pork bone soup and my grandparents usually get bim bim bop."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is good. However, the service is atrocious. Please make sure to double check your bill because they like to calculate tax on each item separately and on each of our items there was about a dollar or so extra added on top of tax."}
{"text":"So after reading reviews I decided to try this place, tried hot stone pot bibimbap with bulgogi for $9. This place was filled with Koreans. In my opinion if it's popular with"}
{"text":"Okay, I came here after a few beers and basically no food all night, so my review might be... influenced.

I was STARVING and came here with Ryan T. and Imran N. As far as I can remember the food was very very delicious, though the kimchi seafood pancake wasn't as good as the one at Chowon. We walked out of there absolutely full and paid around $10 each. Insane. 

Oh, and also right after we entered, about 30 young Korean kids came and filled up the place. So, I guess it's pretty popular amongst Korean people as well, which is always a good sign."}
{"text":"Neat Korean restaurant located in the lower floor of a building on Spadina. There's lots of variety to choose from when it comes Korean food - theres also dinner for one options if you are feeling hungry \"sets\" - I opted for a spicy pork on purple rice. It was very tasty, flavourful and not too spicy. They also give a variety of side dishes."}
{"text":"Lunch for two on a Tuesday. Not too busy. 5 tables out of maybe 20?

Located in the basement. Nice and spacious, and looked pretty clean for a restaurant in chinatown. Did not check the washroom facilities however. Will remember in the future.

Offers flat chopsticks that you usually find in korean restaurants here, but wooden disposable ones are available by request if that is your thing. Other tableware includes spoons and napkins at arms-length. A bottle of water provided for easy-access self-serve.

Menu comes with a lot of options.

Five side-dishes were offered, though from other pictures it looks like they offer random options, so YMMV.

Ordered the stone bowl bibimbap with bulgogi (#82). Size wasn't too bad. The meat looked kind of like ground beef with sesame sprinkled on top but perhaps they just decided to chop it up into small bite-sized pieces so that it is easier to eat. No visible sauces were added and all of the vegetables were nice and dry, with a small egg on top. I'm left wondering if I was not eating it the proper way.

Came to $13.50 after tax.
Minimum $20 for credit card.

Definitely like the way they've worked out their prices when it comes to rounding however.
Experience wasn't that great for the first time, but perhaps it's just what I ordered."}
{"text":"I do not know what is going on... or perhaps I do. 

This place has been going down in quality for some reason. I mean, it is far from bad and more consistent than places with a more Canadian flavour bias like Ka Chi, specially if you consider their new K-Town location. 

Still, I am not sure if my PBS taste has gotten more picky/refined/better/worse? but I find the soup at SAS to be not as good as it used to be. 

Perhaps is the fact that Yelpers were obsessed about this venue but pretty much no one else? Perhaps SAS may be cutting back on expenses? Because aside running into the odd Yelper here, SAS seems to always be practically devoid of customers when I am there. Generally it will be my party and another table, maybe two at most. At first I did not mind, it is awesome to have a run of the place but I also don't want them to go out of business.

As some of you may know, my friend Reggie and I were on a Pork Bone Soup Quest and found a really good place in K-Town to satiate our PBS and ban chan obsession, unfortunately after finding out that place, we both find SAS a bit lackluster. 

I have noticed the broth to be a bit weaker and I feel bad about it since I really like Seor Ak San -- not to mention convenient for me to get to. 

I always request my PBS to be \"extra, extra spicy\"  and even with all that spice the broth always managed to come through strong. 

However the last two instances I was there the soup tasted somewhat watery and the main flavour that stood out came from the chili, not so much from the broth. 

Furthermore I find that seaweed is a ban chan not all places like to offer often, possibly due to cost (most Korean restaurants do not fly in cirrus-high margins after all) and although I have no issue with places rotating their ban chan offerings, when you start focusing on the cheaper options, then we have a problem. Few people like oiled bean sprouts!  Don't offer them as much. 

Also, FYI, we can tell how old Kimchi is by colour and consistency and sometimes it does not look good to give poor looking veggies. I am well aware it is still quite edible but most people do not come for extra fermented Kimchi.

However, all being said and done, SAS is still one of the better, if not the best place for PBS in Chinatown, but the Yelper darling it once was? I am not so sure anymore."}
{"text":"Always go here with my friends whenever I'm craving Korean food !! Really good prices, decent service, but good food. Again, I'm only giving it four stars cause of service. But otherwise, it's good food for a great price. I say it's a good price because most Korean restaurants I've been too -- mainly in Korea Town (Christie), their dishes range from around 15-20$! I highly recommend this to those who are on a budget and are craving some great Korean food."}
{"text":"Very drab appearance, inside and out. Its in a basement in Chinatown, so you expect it to be a bit dirty, but it is clean and well-kept. Mostly empty when we went.
The tea we received was some hot and very weak boricha (mugicha) barley tea, and the drink selection is unimpressive, very minimal.  Menus are laminated and tattered.

However, the food was spectacular. Every dish was delicious. We had spicy Kalbi, ojingo bokum, fried rice with vegetables, dolsot tofu bibimbap, mandu, dok bok ki, and kimchi seafood pancake.  We were also served a complimentary pancake from the house as well as 6 banchan.  Obviously, Korean ownership, management and staff.
The spiciness was quiet enjoyable, quite piquant but not unbearably hot. 
Some people at our table mentioned that they particularly liked the dokbokki rice  cakes, the mandu dumplings, the squid ojingo bokum and the spicy kalbi. In short, al most of the dishes were someones favourite, and nothing at all was even mediocre. The dishes were good or fantastic. Prices are very reasonable, and the service was very prompt. As soon as I wanted to order, they promptly took our order. 

Strong recommend, and would return here anytime. Now my favourite Korean restaurant in Toronto, also my favourite restaurant in Chinatown. I'm only afraid to recommend it for fear it will become popular. However, it is not a fancy place to impress a date, this is more for good eatin'"}
{"text":"Kimchi stew once again. Quick service, busy store during lunch hours, and DELICIOUS STEW! At this point, Seor Ak San is my second home."}
{"text":"I came here during one of my quickie lunch breaks and ordered my staple, Gamjatang (Pork Bone Soup).  Upon the dish arriving to my table, I immediately noticed the pork bone broth looked clearly watered down.  I was able to tell, because when I tasted the soup, it was quite bland.  The only flavour that shone through was the hot pepper flakes that ended up settling on each spoonful I took from the bowl. I will commend them for offering 5 complimentary side dishes.  . I'm not sure if they had changed their recipe or decided to stretch that pork bone broth just a little further, Seor Ak San is not the same as it use to be."}
{"text":"Bibimbap here was really tasty, good volume, rice was not burned like most other places! Would go back again for some yummy Korean food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quick bite with my wife very authentic greeted with hot tea upon arrival fast nice service will come again!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Lots of affordable Korean dishes. Pretty busy and popular.  I'd say it's not a one $ price though. It's good value but you're spending $14+ per person and getting one dish.  It's a big dish so its still good value. All the Korean favourites and more.  They play some Korean hip hop tracks too."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced Korean food. I got a Dolsot Bibimbap with Chicken for around $9. Portions were large. I had a tiny bit left over and saved it for breakfast the next morning since I hate wasting food., and it still tasted very good :)

It was crazy busy when I went, but the waiter was hustling!"}
{"text":"This is a great Korean restaurant on Spadina. Great food and service, delicious and good portion size for your money. For $8 you get a wholesome meal with 5 samplers  and hot tea. Definitely recommend this place. It is safe to eat."}
{"text":"Didn't realize Seor Ak San was such a date place! :)

Maybe because of Yelp reviews, my expectations were set really high, kinda like when everyone tells you how good a movie is, and when you go watch it, you're like, that was good, but 5 star worthy?

I've been here a couple of times now, and don't get me wrong, everything was very good, but not blown away, since my first time here, our server \"forgot\" about us, even though there was only 4 covers.  We had to have an early dinner (5:15) because we had somewhere to go, and the service this day couldn't have been slower.  We literally had to go to the waitress to place our order, and when we tried to get the bill, we had to go to them again.  Some how waving our arms in the air frantically is completely invisible to them.

Back again recently with a 3/4 full restaurant, and the service was still unacceptably slow, but since we were there to just hang out, none of us thought much about it.  Friends of mine live around the corner from here, so we've been popping by here for a quick bite on occasion.

Food is good, we've sampled quite a bit of it now, but to be honest, I prefer my K-food from Yonge/Finch area."}
{"text":"We had heard that the food in Toronto was amazing, and we couldn't wait to try new restaurants.  This place was fantastic!  The service was excellent, and it was priced reasonably for the quantity/quality.  It is not a formal restaurant, but the environment is clean and comfortable.  We had a delicious meal and will be back again.  We had Korean BBQ (sirloin), kimchi soup, and shrimp bibimbap.  It was all excellent."}
{"text":"This place has the best kamjatang I've tried in Chinatown Toronto, because the best Korean pork bone soups I've tried are either in West Toronto (Christie Station, in Korea Town) or uptown near Yonge Station and Finch Avenue (Finch Station). The broth for the stew is flavorful and you can ask the waiter for non spicy and they will accommodate your request willingly and courteously. The wait staff is efficient if not kind, polite and patient while taking orders from a large group (my friends and I were with a large group after a campus group gathering). If I'm in the CT area again, I'll give this a revisit if I am craving Korean food (which I'll admit is often...) again."}
{"text":"The rumours are true, this is home to T-Dot's BEST BIBIMBAP - even better than Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu.  Seor Ak San has been opened for about a year and even though its pretty far away from Christie & Bloor (Korea Town), this place does not lack in authenticity! 

I came here with a friend after work because I had a hankering for Asian food, but not Chinese.  

I ordered the Dolsot Bibimbap and my DC ordered the Pork Bone Soup.  We also had to order the Spicy Kalbi.  The portion sizes are gi-normous.  I couldn't finish mine and had to doggy bag it.  The appetizers are also generous, with 7 dishes altogether.  This included a spinach pan-fried rice cake, seaweed, chapchae, marinated peanuts, kimchee, sweet potato and a Korean-style penne.  

I love their Bibimbap because as Eric L. mentioned, the rice forms a nice crust at the bottom of the bowl, and it gives it a nice crunchy texture.  My bowl of Bibimbap was piled sky high with all the fixings... bean sprouts, shiitake mushroom, spinach, beef, cucumber, carrots and to top it off - a fried egg.  I was stuffed!  This is optional, but I love dousing my Bibimbap with the hot sauce.  Yummy!!!!

The Spicy Kalbi was get down get down.  You can tell they marinate their beef thoroughly as you could taste the intensity of the flavours.  Coupled with the seared goodness of the sizzling plate, this is a MUST TRY item.  It is for sure THE best kalbi I've tasted in Toronto and I've had quite a few.

The damage at the end of the day was about $30 plus some change.  I will be coming back again and again.  This might have just become my favourite place to eat in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I eat Korean food a lot, and usually with a Korean. Living near Finch and going to Christie often, I have a general sense of prices and quality.

To start, the side dishes were good. Not overwhelmingly diverse like Oh Geul bo Geul. If I can count, there were 7 side dishes. 

We had Kang Poon Gi (fried chicken with spicy sauce) and grilled mackerel with kimchi stew. Both were pretty good. The mackerel was salted well. I go crazy when food is too salty. This mackerel was just right. The Kang Poon Gi was well portioned. I thought it was expensive at first but the portion made it worth it. But I wish it was cheaper with a smaller portion. I think the average person can't finish this much fried chicken. It wasn't terribly spicy. Just perfect for me. 

One nice thing about this restaurant is that you can ask them to adjust the spiciness of food. It's a nice touch. 

I wish they didn't serve plain white rice. A lot of Korean places serve healthier rice like brown rice or rice with some grains. 

Based on what we tried, Seor Ak San serves up pretty good food. My only complaint are the prices. Everything was $2-4 more than what I would expect from other places I've tried. $2-4 might sound like pocket change but on Korean food, it's a difference between 20-40%! Then if you add tax and tips...And when you eat out  3-5 times a week like me, it adds up. Because I have closer and cheaper alternatives at the same quality, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. But if you're in Chinatown and want to eat Korean, then by all means go here."}
{"text":"Cheap delicious food in chinatown. The cold noodle was a bit too vinegary for my taste but the pork bone soup was amazing. I would go back for the soup. And it came with 5 side dishes and bean rice."}
{"text":"Neat little place. It's a hole in wall, down a flight of stairs.  We had beef bulgogi and some sweet and sour chicken dish.  Get the banchan; little side orders of stuff, noodles, and vegetables and (dramatic pause) kimchi. Very korean food; polite, looks innocent and will beat the snot (litterally) out of your sinuses.  Everything here has kick to it, so if you think ketchup is too much, don't come here, but unlike a lot of spicy places, there is taste in everything here."}
{"text":"I had to try this place after Lauren dubs it the best bibimbap. If it were true I would be the happiest person alive as it means I don't have to go far from work at all for good Korean. 

My verdict? I don't know if I'm well versed enough in bibimbap to make such a statement, but I do know for sure it is one of the better ones I've had! Definitely the best outside of Koreatown I've had and I echo Lauren's observations of large portions with tons of veggies! And the banchan was plentiful and more diverse than anywhere else I've been to. 

Susan G (who I drag along to every place I discover here on Yelp) got the beef soon tofu and while you don't get to crack your own egg over it, if you fish hard enough you will find it in there! 

Could be cheaper but the quality and quantity makes it all worth the while and the staff as with most Korean places are very friendly. Finally a location to get my Korean craving out of the way without having to TTC anywhere!"}
{"text":"I've been craving  for a really long time, and finally got to satisfy it here. Food was excellent, atmosphere was on point, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is among the best Korean places in the city. Their Budae Chigae is amazing, and under $10. Different Korean places serve different arrangements of side dishes, but I find Seor Ak San has picked all my favourites."}
{"text":"How do I describe? it's like Owl of Minerva + BCDST + House of Soon Tofu + any chinese owned Korean/Japanese place - Chinese owned and all other non Korean food + ironcast Unagi and Kastus

That probably made no sense. Let me elaborate. 

I came here prior to the Elite event at the Augusta House. I found it mostly because it's hte highest rated place near by, and I love Bibimbap and these guys swear it's the best. 

What I love is the diverse menu. 
In addition to traditional korean foods like Bulgogi and Japchae, they had 6 kinds of Bibimbap, 2 kinds of Kalbi, all sorts of Soon Tofu, and all sorts of Pork Bone soup. 

See my pic, because foe $8.95 that's what you get. The original BiBimbap was tastey! Lots of fixings on top and let your rice sit there for a bit, you get a crunch bottom. I did find the rice sticky though, I think that's a good sign. It's a tight race between this one and the one at Buk Chang Dong... but this one wins because of the pile high extras on the rice. 

We also ordered a Kalbi. They were unable to give us a smaller order than the main course ($12.95) , but I had to try the Sweet/Spicy Kalbi. NOM NOM NOM [licks sticky fingers]. This has got to be the best thing in the world. 

We waddled out of the restaurant already planning a trip back."}
{"text":"Very good value for ur money. I had the pork bone soup and short ribs. Both were delicious :) portion sizes were pretty generous and servers were friendly. This is my go to place when I'm sick because their soup is amazing!"}
{"text":"I really love coming to this place, especially in the winter time when I would like a flavourful, hearty meal. 

Things I've tried and really recommend:

Kimchi fried rice. DELICIOUS. 
PORK BONE SOUP. In my opinion, probably their best menu item. The meat is so tender that it falls apart with your fork easily. Juicy, flavourful and they give you a lot of meat. The broth is delicious, especially if you get it spicy mmmmmmmmmmmm mmm. 
Green onion pancakes (these come for free). I tried these for the first time at this restaurant and now love them. 
Bibimbap with Bulgogi Beef was really yummy. So much flavour. 

The side dishes were plentiful and delicious. 

Portions are quite large as well so you could probably share the dishes as well. 

Staff are friendly and overall service is good.

Atmosphere is very casual, quiet for the most part. Nothing special with the decor but you'll be too busy enjoying your food (hopefully) to notice. 

I definitely say give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ooooh my god, Seor Ak San, where do I even begin.

Honestly, this place is my go-to for Korean food whenever I'm downtown. The food is excellent, cheap, and massive in portion. The banchan are various and refilled at request. The place is clean, if a bit spare in decoration. The service is fast and the servers nice and helpful. It's rare to ever come in to a completely empty restaurant.

My faves are the japchae, gamjatang, and tofu bibimbap in a stone pot. Fair warning, come on a very, very empty stomach."}
{"text":"I'm honestly not sure how this place is rated so high. Extremely slow servive. Waited at least 20-30 mins for a waiter to take our order when the place wasn't even busy (server was simply cleaning tables & avoiding patrons). The people beside us waited 30-35 mins to have their order taken. We ordered Stone bowsl. Once the food finally arrived we found it extremely bland. We had a shrimp bowl and a beef short rib bowl. The short rib was the only one that was decent. If you are looking for good Korean food with decent service, I'd recommend skipping this place and going to Koreatown."}
{"text":"It's a good location amidst Chinatown -- a nice change from the typical Korean restaurants in Koreatown. However, it is located below ground level. There are better renovated Korean restaurants in the area if you're concerned about the ambiance. 

The tofu soups are good here and I usually order that over the bibimbap. I recommend anything that's spicy soup or stone pot. Pork bone soup is kind of average here. I think they could use a bit more spices and garnish on the pork.

Everything is warm and filling and taste very satisfying though. They're also very quick with side dishes and the price is very reasonable. I've had better kimchi but it's definitely above average here."}
{"text":"Probably the best Korean restaurant in all of Toronto. It really is that good. Buried (literally) at the bottom of a small staircase in the downtown Chinatown this is a literal diamond in the rough.

Food menu is diverse, the dishes are well prepared and taste great, and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in Chinatown. Waitress was polite and friendly and service was quick. Food came out in less than 15 minutes. It was busy on Saturday night but there was no wait. You get about 6 side dishes with your order and they were tasty. I ordered the bulgogi dol so bibimbap and it was good. Most Korean restaurants I've been to give you white rice instead of the red bean rice. I like the red bean rice a lot better! The only downfall to the entree was that it didn't come with actual pieces of beef but just ground beef which was a first for me. Meal came out to be around $13 with taxes."}
{"text":"A little sad that there's no wifi available, but the seafood pancake wasn't too disappointing. $11.70 for a plate with white rice"}
{"text":"I've been going here with my older siblings for a while, everytime we meet up we go here. It's great! The food is fast, and it tastes great, and its large and spacious and has lots of items on the menu, but one of the items I eat is this, stir fried beef and squid etc which is delicious but my problem with it is, its literally 90% cooked onions and 5% beef and 5% squid, I'm not ordering stir-fried onions with some beef and onions. I'm ordering stir fried beef and squid with some onions. Otherwise the other food is great, they serve large servings and lots of sides to pick and choose from."}
{"text":"Pretty deece. Would recommend if you're needing dat gimme ja tang. I would say for the amount of food you're getting for the prices - TOTALLY WORTH. Got the meal for two (pancake, noodles, bibimbap), and there was still so much food leftover, and my boyfriend can really put away a lot. 

I mean, food is pretty standard, but service is quick, dishes are satisfying, and worth the price. Totes my goats, would come again."}
{"text":"Bibimbap is my favorite hungover/fill up your belly/lots of food for cheap/zomg i want more  type of food.

According to my friend this is one of the best Bibimbap in town and I agree. There was so much, yet it was so hot/fresh/yummy.  The best part was that since the bowl was so big, there was so much of that rice crust that forms on the bottom of the bowl.  

They bring you a ton of appetizers and tea.  It always amazes me how these places can charge so little yet give you so much food.

5 star place!"}
{"text":"So friggin good. The little side dishes are amazing as well! Great price for amazing taste"}
{"text":"hmmmm i'm a little puzzled.. what's the big rave about??

i went there after reading so many amazing reviews,..
as korean i may be a hard critique but i thought it was so-so and so did my non korean bf..
after trying their bibimbap and pork bone soup, we both agreed that buk chang dong is the better of the two..
just sayin..."}
{"text":"This place was pretty wonderful and cheap! They are generous with the veggies and the price is a breath of fresh air compared to local Canadian restaurants. I had a noodles and kimchi stew which cleaned my sinuses for the following week and I also tried the bibimbap (standard Korean dish). The barley tea was warm and delicious. Seor Ak San is also a fun place to eavesdrop in Chinese if you know Mandarin. There seemed to be a lot of college students from a nearby university."}
{"text":"Food is on point! Service is minimal, had to track down the waiter every time we wanted something and we were only one of two tables in the room. But by golly the food is delicious. Got dumplings which were nice and a hot pot of pork and udon noodles which was amazing!"}
{"text":"A surprising place on spadina, hidden in a basement but definitely worth it if you're looking for good cheap Korean food. 
The servers were friendly, gave us a vegetarian pancake \"on the house\" while we waited for our food.. which wasn't much of a wait. 
In traditional style, food was quick and well made. The ramen was hugely portioned and the stock was spicy but not unbearable. 
Pork bone soup was good but not the best I've had. 
Dumpling soup was really yummy. 
Would go back if looking for cheap and quick but still yummy food."}
{"text":"I used to be a Seor (i.e. someone that can see things in the future, a clairvoyant, a mystic), but I lost the ability when I gave birth to my first boy (aka san, as opposed to doughter), so they now call him the Seor, but I call him Seor AKA San.

Long story short, this place has some of the best Korean food anywhere in Ontario. I don't have to be a clairvoyant to know that. But my friend Clair (Clair Voyant) agrees.

What to get: Kam Ja Tang (Pork Bone Soup)
Why: Baby, that is what you Kam for. Lightning strikes when you taste the soup. And everybody's watching you. But you're looking at. Sou-hoo-hoo-hoo-houp. Sou-hoo-hoo-hoo-houp. 

The KJT is the star of the show, and it's not only Calvin and Rihanna that think so. Just look at the other reviews. And with good reason. It's easily, by a distance, the best Pork Bone Soup I've ever had. It's similar to Yuk Gae Jang, which they don't have, but is offered at many other Korean places.

The Kam Ja Tang is red juicy spicy delicious heaven, and there's tons of it in this order, too. It's dirt cheap, and even if it was twice as much it'd be worth it. It's orgasmic, and it is second only in Toronto to the incredible fried Pork and Chive dumplings across the street at Dumpling House.

It's got tons of pork, enormous portion, perfect spice, lovely sides too. One of the best meals I've ever had in Canada, really.

I brought a few cute choirboys here, and by the end of the meal, we all San from the same hymn sheet about the Kam Ja Tang.

I wish they had Yuk Gae Jang though, even though some of their dishes are similar.

So what is YGJ? It's the best thing Koreans ever invented, that's what! Forget Kimchi, ok no don't that's amazing too, but forget Kimchi for the sake of arguments (leave that stuff to Kimchi Kardashian and Kimchi Basinger), and forget Bulgogi (which looks less sexy when worn than Bvlgari anyway), and focus for a minute, Ari Grande style, on YGJ.

It's an amazing, spicy-but-not-too-spicy, delicious bright red beef noodle soup, with all sorts of amazing veggies and sprouts and noodles mixed in there along with egg and tofu and beef and basically just... heaven. Might be my fave Asian dish of all.

The service here is absolutely lovely, and it's depressing that they're usually not as busy as some of the other, often inauthentic, and usually inferior Asian restaurants around this Chinatown district of Toronto. Perhaps because they don't offer the flashy stuff that non-Asians in general come to Chinatown for, such as pot stickers and bubble teas and the like? I don't know. But you know, if non-Asians (and indeed non-Koreans) aren't familiar with dishes such as Kam Ja Tang and Yuk Gae Jang, then they are really, really missing out. These dishes are so good, they should be beloved by all people of all nations and cultures.

Like McDonald's is.

Oh wait.

Anyway McDonald's is a bit of a Seor subject with me so I'm going to end this review now. Get here. Order Kam Ja Tang. Thank me later. Or now if you prefer. In advance works."}
{"text":"The food was soooo good, I got the squid bibimbap which was probably some of the best I've had & my friend got the spicy rice cakes which were pretty good, but I've had better. There was so many side dishes which were also really yummy and the overall service was pretty average considering it was a Korean restaurant. I'd eat here again and recommend it to anyone in the mood for Korean food."}
{"text":"the pork bone soup was really good.  friendly wait staff, and clean. no frills."}
{"text":"VERY good hidden gem kind of spot! It's in the basement and is very cozy. I went with a group of friends and all of us got Gamjatang because it seemed popular with other people! For only about $9 it was great value! 

Their side dishes are also delicious. The spicy rice cake was excellent, I wanted to keep eating it! Perfect mix of spicy, salty, sour, and sweet. Would definitely go back next time!"}
{"text":"Large sized Korea restaurant located in the basement on Spadina in the midst of Chinatown. It offers all the typical Korean fares as well as some korean/chinese fusion dishes?

We ordered the seafood kimchi pancake, the pork bone soup and the gable soup. Our pancake came 70% burnt and very very oily... The vegetables on top of the pork bone soup were bland (tasted as if they had been benched and thrown onto the dish). The soup lacked depth and tasted like a pork broth with added hot peppers at the very end. Galbi soup was pretty good.

Prices were expensive for the area and for korean food ($10 for pork bone soup incl taxes, ~$13 for seafood pancake incl taxes). We ended up paying a total of $38 for everything."}
{"text":"Great location....right on Spadina, who would have thought?

Bimbibap is very good, better than Buk Chang Dong? nah but close.
Tofu is pretty solid.
Seafood pancake with vegetable is very comforting.

If you're downtown, this is the best spot for some Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Korean
Menu items: Bibimbap and random Korean appetizers

In the heart of China Town lays a small Korean joint that is home to one of the best Bibimbap, at a very affordable price.

So what exactly is a Bibimbap? A Bibimbap is a signature Korean dish. The word literally means \"mixed meal\" or \"mixed rice\". To me, is a bowl of goodness with a ton of flavour, a \"yolky\" attitude and a price that makes it taste even better.

From what I noticed, the rice starts sticking and toasting in the bottom of the bowl as it is being brought to your table. The julienne vegetables are perfectly seasoned and cooked and start warming up as you mix them with the rice. The dish, if you wish, can be topped off with an egg. Once your knife breaks into the yolk and your veggies and rice get coated with all that buttery goodness, you realize you can't wait to get to the bottom of the bowl. That rice crust that forms at the bottom is exactly what I look for as I take that last bite at my Bibimbap.

Seor Ak San, which is the name given to the restaurant as a tribute to one of the highest mountains in South Korea, welcomes all guests with a complimentary set of appetizers that are, well, appetite-opening.

When I got all these little tapas-style appies on the table, I did not know which one to try first!  These all looked really yummy and being complimentary (on the house), tasted even better. From taste and with a bit of explanation from the waiter what we got consisted of a spinach pan-fried rice cake (my favourite of them all), seaweed, chapchae (a popular Korean noodle dish), sweet potato and kimchee (a Korean fermented cabbage dish). There were two more that I was not a fan of and I guess as a result I cannot recall their names.

All in all, I would highly recommend Seor Ak San if you are in the mood for good, tasty and affordable Korean dishes. The staff is very friendly, the place is clean and the dishes are really well put together. I would almost say this is a rather healthy place to eat at given all the veggie intake you get in one seating.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Pork bone soup!  I've been having this stuff for the longest time up at First Markham Place and until today could not find one better. Well, Seor Ak San sets a new bar folks. Perfectly spiced (I got the 'regular'), the meat (and lots of it) falling off the bone, lots of sides, and great service. The place is down a set of stairs off Spadina but nice and clean. Very affordable too.

Also tried the bibimbap and found it a little dry but good too.  The PBS was my main though and made this place tops in my books. Will definitely be back. 

Interesting note - they call out PBS as Kamjatang. Every place I've ever been to until here calls it gamjatang.  Lost in translation - no biggie.."}
{"text":"Excellent, flavorful food at a great price! I don't eat Korean food very often, so my standard for it may not compare to others. But I thought it was good compared to what I've tried so far. My family ordered various noodle dishes, including noodles with meat sauce, a noodle soup w/ kimchi & spices, and a glass noodle soup - none were bland, all full of their respective flavors. I got a hot pot bulgogi bibimbap, which was probably the best I've ever had. The rice was crispy, the mix of vegetables and proteins just right. I liked that the meat was minced so that when I mixed the contents of the pot, the meaty flavor was dispersed evenly throughout the dish. Add some dashes of the spicy sauce and it was perfect. 

The complimentary appetizers were delicious as well. My favorites were the sweet pickled cabbage and the glass noodles flavored with some sort of aromatic oil. We received a scallion pancake at well, which just tasted amazing - very crispy exterior and soft, chewy interior, packed full of scallion and fried yumminess. 

Service was also prompt, and I liked that we were given some water to serve ourselves from the start, saving us the hassle of asking for refills."}
{"text":"I love this place a lot. The way the food is cooked is right up my alley! It like a home cooked meal but better. And the servings (portion and taste) are good. The service is great too. Never fails.

As an update this year (2016), they have raised their prices about $1-2. I think this happened sometime late into 2015 so its quite \"shock\" for someone like me who came back after awhile of not visiting. Still, the quality and taste is still the same and its still worth the money spent.

I recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall, but a pretty nice one. It's super convenient for a ton of university students nearby so the lunch and dinner crowds tend to be composed of that demographic. Their prices are all incredibly economical - enormous portions with a good selection of side dishes. Their hot pots are very popular in the winter and perfect for sharing at a table for 2. You come for the food, and not really for the spectacular service or decor or ambiance, so those qualities tend to fall quite short. Otherwise, for a lunch, dinner or late night snack, it suffices."}
{"text":"Good sized portions. I ordered the yukejang (lots of onions and green onions) and seafood pancake. It's open late which was great for us because we had just gotten in the city. The location can be difficult to spot since it's located down some stairs."}
{"text":"Typical  looking Korean restaurant.  Prices are a little cheaper compared to bloor koreatown. But you get what you paid for. We ordered the table BBQ and the meat wasn't the best quality.  The vegstable wrap didn't come with the salad and the lettuce was still soaked in water which was quite annoying.  Service was good but wasn't good enough to mask the poor quality of the food."}
{"text":"I came here based on reviews and the food was okay.

Pork bone soup was probably the best item here since there is quite a lot of meat compared to other restaurants. However, the price is a little bit more. The kalbi beef was also good.

Other items were all okay. Nothing really stood out to me. I ordered the tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes) but it wasn't spicy at all. It was more on the sweet side, and it lacked flavour in general. 

In general, nothing stood out enough for me to come here purposely. But if I am in area, I would say this restaurant has decent Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant in Chinatown !!!! Food were all delicious and authentic, the price was very reasonable. 

Side dishes were all very flavourful. We ordered one Korea style hot pot, fried vegetable noodles and grilled sea eel over rice. The food were all a little sweet and fresh.Yummy! Really worth visiting because its cheap and good food. Staff was nice although not very good in english. But we can order food by our fingers and numbers on menu~ hahaha"}
{"text":"Best bibimbap I've had! The rice was crunchy which you don't get too much of in other places. The sides were really good and unique compared to the other places. e.g. the pancakes. The potato side was also very good. The pork bone soup had alot of meat on it still whereas at other places you find that's it's mostly bone. Great prices as well!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, nice place, nice service and the restaurant looks nice btw. The decorate was too nice, will be back"}
{"text":"You may have noticed, I've come here many times.  Other times I haven't written the review.

However it's been a while and while this is the best place for Kalbi short ribs, teh service is just blah.  It's ok but not the best.  

The lady that works here must be the owner because while staff have come and gone she hasn't.  Anyways, it's been irritating a few times when we order the one with the grill (I can't remember what it's called but its' not called korean bbq) we like to cook it as we eat as opposed to cooking all at once.

Anyways, the lady comes over and just starts putting all our meat (while we are still eating) and quickly cooks it so she can turn off the gas.  Needless to say, we ended up eating the meat after it was cold by the time we got to it.  

Side dishes are good but kinda skimpy.  You get one refill, but if you get it to go they try not give you as many sides.  We bought three dinners, they only gave us sides for two.

If only the service were better, sigh"}
{"text":"Mmm if you like Korean food you're in for a treat here. This place has the most delicious pork bone soup. I'm no Korean food expert but I know good food when I taste it! The lady that owns this restaurant is a very sweet lady, although she doesn't seem to know much English, she's very accommodating. The glass noodles are also delicious."}
{"text":"The tea is surprisingly good. The food is ok too. Not great, but probably better than you'd expect from a place that looks like a giant underground bubble tea shop. 

I tried the bibimbap, as per other yelpers' suggestions. It was plentiful, and fairly tasty. Something about it though, like the rest of this place, was chirpy and cheesy. 

The place is in a sparsely but horribly decorated largish basement, with lime green- and salmon-coloured walls and ugly fluorescent lighting. The music is unbelievably cheesy (k-pop!). I spent most of my meal trying to figure out which songs they were knocking off. \"Lady in red\" and Avril Lavigne's \"what the hell\" were definite stand-outs!"}
{"text":"So happy that Yelp led me here.  This is a good place for cheap food in Toronto.  Just close your eyes and ignore the tacky furnishings and passive-aggressive service.  

I got the spicy kalbi.  omg it was so good.  Marinated so well, so tasty, just enough spice to make it interesting.  Good portion size for the price.  They give 6 banchai, all of which were delicious.  With tax, it came out to $15, totally worth it.  I couldn't have cooked all that for $15.  

Too bad it was too hot in the late afternoon that day to try their soups."}
{"text":"Looking for satisfying Korean food that doesn't break your wallet and doesn't require you to travel to Bloor & Christie or Yonge & Finch? Look no further!

nom nom nom. We came here for lunch, and it was quite empty, but the food was great! I had the kimchi chicken fried rice, and it was surprisingly excellent! AND it's open until 11 PM, so it sounds like it would be a great place for late night food, like if you get hungry in the middle of a party in Chinatown or something."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. 5/5

I had their pork bone soup and it was absolutely delicious. The purple rice that comes with the dish was tasty too.

This is a boring review because this restaurant is just only a generic Korean restaurant that locates in a basement. But I have nothing bad to say about here. Great for lunch and dinner if you like something super casual."}
{"text":"Came in at roughly 5:30 pm on american thanksgiving and were immediagely seated.

Service was fast, along with complimentary hot tea, which is definitely nice since it's getting cold out, kudos to them there.

As for the food, my short rib bimbimbop was pleasant. The veggies were fresh and instead of the typical white grain rice, purple grain rice was the standard. No raw egg though so that was a little disappointing but oh well. The meat was tender and exceptionally marinaded. My friends enjoyed their dishes as well.

Solid four out of five."}
{"text":"I visited here from out of town and had a great experience. The spicey wings are a must have! The girl working was also very helpful in explaining the menu."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten bibimbap in two places: Hana Korea on Baldwin (3 times in the last 6 months) and Seor Ak San (once last week).

My review is very simple: IMO Hana Korea is  better than Seor Ak San (in terms of bibimbap and banchan only)."}
{"text":"Very good bibimbap (I wish they gave more meat though),
tons of fresh veggies in it."}
{"text":"So at the time I went, it was the weekend and it was around the lunch hour...
It was empty and I guess I was the first customer of the day.
Anyways, pretty affordable menu but only con was that the restaurant itself was sorta hidden away.

I got the kanpoogi (spicy and sweet fried chicken) meal for $15.50 after taxes. Gotta say, that's a bit on the expensive side. The chicken itself was very crispy even with lots of sauce slather on top of it and it came out of the kitchen piping hot. Service was ok, wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant right when I got to Toronto. My friend told me to go to Christie but I insisted that we go here. My first time jajangmyun... They didn't make it nice. I thought that was a waste of money.. The pork cutlet was as usual and the ribs were bit disappointing. Too many fats. Maybe they make it better during night time??"}
{"text":"Located closely to University of Toronto, I came here yesterday with a friend of mine during lunch.  The layout reminded me a lot of Hana Korea on Baldwin Street.

Anyhow, I ordered myself soon dooboo (like always), and my friend ordered the jjajungmyun.    The banchans that they offered were delicious -- I think my favourite was the spinach pancake (which, I still need to figure out how they made it)!

The soon dooboo was quite good -- full of tofu!  I ordered myself the soon dooboo with kimchi, pork, and dumplings.  Spicy level was pretty good - but I think I would've liked it spicier.  Prices were decent, about $7.50 for the soondooboo -- considering that it's downtown, and close to U of T, that's actually not too bad.

In regards to service, it was okay -- not amazing, but you can't expect much out of an Asian restaurant.

At least now I know there's another convenient Korean restaurant in the vicinity!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for very good and affordable Korean food, Seor Ak San will likely satisfy your needs. It's definitely not big on atmosphere, but it's very clean and the food is great! As a Korean who grew up on Korean food, I'm pretty selective and it's just too painful for me to eat at trendy Korean restaurants that charge $20 for bibibamp. Service here was great too!"}
{"text":"It's a little difficult to locate as it in a basement on Spadina with a very small board outside. 

We went here for dinner as we were craving Korean and were super hungry.The first thing we ordered was Beef Dumplings which was not Korean ;P....lol

For the mains we ordered Hot Stone Kimchi U-dong and Stone Pot Bibimbap with spicy pork Bulgogi. Food was good, I would give it 4/5 but I didn't like the ambience. Service was slow, we had to wait long to get the server on our table.

I don't think we will go back to this place."}
{"text":"This place left me wanting more..and more..and more.

I am ashamed to say, I always order bulgogi and bibimbap..and its always epic.

Do not go here expecting an amazing ambience, or a cutural experience - but do expect AMAZING Korean food."}
{"text":"I have been going there for a few years now. I always get their stone-pot dishes that come steaming. Very comforting in winters. 

Today I tried a vegetable pancake and liked it. It was a little greasy but perfect for Lunch.

Quite reasonable price wise."}
{"text":"Healthy portions: yup
Flavor: there's some, but there could be more.
Decor: eh

After checking Yelp and seeing 4 stars, we decided to try this place out. We showed up in the last hour they were opened and ordered hot stone bulgogi bibimbap and regular short rib bibimbap. Out came a healthy portion of freshly prepared fresh ingredients. The bulgogi could've used a bit more flavor, but there's always hot sauce to help things out. All in all, a solid spot. The decor's spartan, but the value's in the food."}
{"text":"Huge portions that are great for sharing. fast service. amazing food. need I say more?:)"}
{"text":"This is a take out service review- I absolutely love dine in.

Extremely disappointed with the level of service and detail to their take out. We ordered our regular seafood pancake, dukk bokki, spicy sirloin and rice. I requested the ramen noodles in the dukk bokki be replaced with glass noodles as they have always done for me during done-in without a problem. After placing my order, I confirmed with the gentleman that I was ordering 3 items. 

Upon receiving my order (someone picked up for us), the seafood pancake was a complete soggy, soy-saturated disaster. Somehow the plastic sauce container melted and all the soy sauce, and I mean the ENTIRE thing leaked into the container and was absorbed by the pancake. Please see photos. The plastic was melted to a smooth finish, the grids on the container aren't even visible anymore! A waste of $9!  We couldn't eat the pancake, it was too salty.

The dukk bokki- my most anticipated dish(I was famished)!  It was with ramen!! I hate ramen because it absorbs all the sauce and ends up bloats and starchy. Thoroughly disappointed.

The sirloin was okay.

I called to express my concerns and luckily got the same gentleman who took my order. He was apologetic but definitely didn't extend any courtesy. I will not be ordering take out again from this place. They are great with eat-ins but I am not sure if it is a communication, assembly line issue or something but our order sucked!"}
{"text":"Came here with three other people on a Saturday night around 9pm. We originally planned to go to Koreatown, but was too far away from it so we decided to stick to getting Korean food somewhere close to downtown, which ended up being in the Chinatown area. The place wasn't busy and we were able to order quickly. I got the seafood soondooboo soup and the mackerel fish to share with my boyfriend, and he got the kimchi pork stir fry (not exactly sure of the name). My other two friends got combo C to share. Soon after our order, our food came out. The soondooboo and the kimchi pork stir fry were both good, however I would have to say that they were a bit on the saltier side. However, the mackerel fish was grilled really well. The three dishes only ended up being $33 in total, which we thought was a really good price as the portions were huge. I tried some in combo 3, including the spicy fried chicken (which was really good) and ddeokbokki (was on the sweeter side, but was still good). We left the place with a lot of food in our stomach feeling satisfied!"}
{"text":"Thanks again to all the Yelpers for helping me find a decent Korean restaurant!   

Decided to give this place a try because I really wanted a pork neck bone soup.  Have to admit that this place was hard to find as the establishment is downstairs.  Going in, it wasn't full but on a Monday night what would you expect.  This isn't a modern and trendy place but not a hole in the wall place either.

Received water pretty quick after sitting down.  Ordered the spicy pork neck stew soup and a few minutes later, the waiter brought 6 side dishes.  The soup came out quick as well.  Tried the soup and it was absolutely tasty!  Got 3 pieces of meat and lots of veggies.  It was so flavorful that I drank most of it!

The service was decent.  I don't expect a lot from these places.  Usually the staff levels aren't high and basically they are taking orders,  bringing out food or cleaning tables.

Total cost for the meal was $9 (before tip).  Can't beat the price.

Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I just had to create an account to write one. This restaurant's service was the worst service I have ever experienced. It took 20 minutes for the waiters to take our order on a Tuesday night when it wasn't even a tad busy. After 45 minutes we never received our food, and the waitress came by with the menus again saying she forgot our order. The food took a while to come so we decided to order our dumplings to-go, until we realized that itself was taking too long. We decided to leave the restaurant and cancel the order, but they charged us for the dumplings anyway and didn't even put in the effort to give us our change back. I don't know if this was on purpose or not, but whoever was working around 6-8PM on a Tuesday night really made our experience at that restaurant awful. 

They gave us a very small portion for the sides, and it even took them 30 minutes to get us cups for our water. I always forgive unintentional poor service, since I understand how hard it can be working in a restaurant..but this was no way unintentional."}
{"text":"Came here for korean food after hearing good reviews of this place from a friend.  I had the pork bone soup extra spicy.  Spice level was perfect.  Did not have a lot kimchi in the soup, but aloooot of beansprouts.  Pork was a tad difficult to get out from the bone.  It also came with purple rice (which is a bonus -since I'm on a hunt looking for Korean places with purple rice). 

My friend ordered the udon with spicy beef and veghies.  It came with a lot of veggies.  I really enjoyed his meal. 

Overall, it tasted pretty good.  Will consider coming back"}
{"text":"Love this place went here for the first time today! I came at 4 pm after a lengthy struggle with physics so I was ready for some good food!

Good food is actually precisely what I got. I ordered the deokbokki mildly spicy and a bibimbap. They came pretty quickly considering there was no one in the restaurant. The bibimbap was massive, lots of vegetables and some bulgogi as well as a fried egg.  I mixed in some of the soy sauce and hot sauce that they place on the table and stirred it around careful not to disturb the bottom layer which would then turn into a crispy section of deliciousness. After the first bite I was in love and I ended up finishing the whole thing.

The deokbokki was also really good, it came mildly spicy as I asked and the rice cakes were chewy and pleasant and the fish cakes were plentiful and they all sat on a bed of perfectly cooked ramyeon noodles. My only
Complaint is that I wish there were more of the rice cakes cause they are excellent.

Finally are the side dishes. They were plentiful and I think there are 6, Some kelp, bean sprouts, glass noodles, a pancake, sweet potato and finally some kimchi. The pancake and the kimchi definitely are the better ones. The variety makes it amazing though! 

The entire restaurant was really clean. Floor was pristine and tables were set up nicely. Lots of seats so unless it's very busy you'll probably get one. No special decorations but that's completely fine.

The service was also really great ( I mean I was the only person in the restaurant) the manager/owner was really kind and checked up on me. It concluded the dining experience very cordially. 

Tl;Dr excellent food, kind waiters and manager and clean environment what is there not to love!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night with a Korean friend. Just came back from a month on the Korean peninsula, so it's safe to say I've had my fair share (and more) of Korean food - I was obviously going through withdrawal symptoms.

Ordered the Haemuljeon (seafood pancake), Kimchi Bokkeumbap (fried rice) and Ra Bokki (instant noodles in a tteok bokki sauce).

All the foods were delicious! Wish the Ra Bokki had a little bit more kick like street Tteokbokki in Korea though. Comfort food at it's best."}
{"text":"We picked this Korean restaurant based on reviews and its proximity to our hotel room.  I am absolutely perplexed to see high ratings for this \"Korean\" restaurant.  We traveled in from the US and was looking for a good Korean place to eat.  When we first walked in, we thought this was a genuine Korean restaurant.  The HyoLee Soju posters are all there, the chopstick and utensil holders were Korean.  The K pop music was playing overhead.  But we were fooled.  It isn't a genuine Korean restaurant....the owners are Chinese.  Let's rate the food:

Kamjatang (pork bone soup): 7/10.  First, the soup base was good but not great.  To get the best try Koreatown in LA or Garden Grove, CA.  Bowls have to be big to attack the meat but they were served in a smallish bowl and topped off with a huge ball of bean sprouts which was kinda weird.  A sign of good Kamjatang is whether the pork is flavorful or bland.  Mine was in-between which meant they did not slow boil the pork long enough.

tofu jjigea: 2/10, flavorless.  Probably one of the worst I've tasted.

Jjajjangmyun (black noodles): 1/10.  No resemblance to the Jjajjangmyun we are used to eating.  Sauce was bland.

Service was great.  Food not so much.

There are probably better Korean restaurants in and around Toronto but not this one."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad, they had all the basic Korean dishes that I like to see, the menu is quite extensive. They did provide the Korean side dishes which are always nice to see, and make it feel more authentic to me!

I ordered the pork bone stew which is one of my favourite dishes. It wasn't quite hot eough when it arrived, it wasn't the bubbling boiling dish that I usually see! It didn't have the cracked black sesame seeds that usually come with the soup and are delicious, overall, it was all kind of underwhelming. 

My friend ordered the squid and beef noodles which looked good :) and no complaints on his end."}
{"text":"SERVICE:  Very friendly, attentive, speak Korean and English well.
ATMOSPHERE: Typical restaurant in Chinatown, don't expect much from the decor. A lot of students both times I went.
FOOD: Very tasty and portions are generous. Pork bone soup is standard with three levels of spicyness. Jajangmyeon is pretty good, creamy and rich. Got the samgyupsal table top cooking once as well, alot of pork belly and lettuce given. Oh yeah, they give different side dishes every day!"}
{"text":"I heard this place is very good. So I went there to check it out. Food was very good and they were not too expensive. But I wasn't happy with the service. They were 5 side dishes on the table and we finished one of them. So we asked for a refill for the one we finished . Now there were other 4 side dishes remaining. After we finished all those 4 dishes we asked them for refilling  those 4 dishes. Then the waitress told me we only aloud to ask for one time only. So basically we only got 1 refill for one side dish only. I was like r u serious. I didn't say anything after that. I admit this place is good but I definitely won't go back"}
{"text":"First meal in Canada for us (from New York), Food was quite good. The rice cake like we requested to not be too spicy. The sauce was different from other Korean places in New York, We order the Beef Dduk Boki and Pork Bone Soup Hot pot(Gamjatang Jungol),  both tasted very good. The pork bone soup was a big portion. We shared it amount four people. 

When we came it was not busy and the service was good. The employees was very friendly."}
{"text":"I've seen this place before but never went in until Nak Won was closed for kitchen repairs and I had to Yelp the next closest Korean restaurant as I was craving Korean food. This place did not disappoint. The service was excellent. There were three servers and they were all nice. They have your typical free appetizers and we also got a whole pancake for a group of four. I got the Kimchi Chigae and it was delicious, comes out boiling hot, as it should. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food, which included Gamjatang and Bulgogi."}
{"text":"I'll throw in my 2 cents.

This place is great. Lots of choices. cheap. near my house. great. the seafood pancake thingy was delicious. There's various korean beer choices you couldn't hope to get drunk off of. The bibimbap is pretty good too. Incidentally, I also love that this place is in a basement. 

It's not the best Korean restaurant in the city in my opinion (see my review of Sariwon http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sariwon-korean-bbq-restaurant-thornhill#hrid:AtXIXu0gG_3EntySQLnQqg/src:self), but its a winner.

I'll be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The stir fried pork with kimchi was delicious!! Prices are good too. Simple place with traditional Korean dishes, great taste and decent pricing"}
{"text":"Came here in a big group for lunch. The menu is extensive, with something for everyone, even the vegans in our party. We got a big round table at the back. Most people went for the dolsot bibimbap, which were served sizzling hot and looked fantastic. For the extra dollar, it definitely seems worth it to go dolsot. The regular bibimbap is served on a big, flat dish and just doesn't look as appealing. I went for the beef chapjae (glass noodles), which were delicious. Portions are big! The Korean appetizers that they bring out in the beginning were also very tasty, including kimchi, potatoes, and green beans. Service was fast and friendly, and prices are very reasonable (lunch for under $10 including tax). Decor is pretty simple and they play random clubbing music."}
{"text":"I like this place. They play upbeat K-pop music. The rice stir fried rice is seasoned well and the pork bone stew was very tender.
My only complaint was the watery chicken dumplings."}
{"text":"I usually don't write it like that ever. I am sorry to say but as Korean from Korea, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. 
foods were ok.(I mean if Canadians say it's ok, It means usually it's not ok). 
I understand It's not in Korea. but compare Other Korean restaurants in Toronto, The side dishes were horrible. also, one of the servers were too unfriendly. I understand Work is hard. so she didn't want to smile. at least she should have said something that if I ask or order. I didn't even know I ordered my foods. 
To be honest, I didn't want to pay at least 5% for a tip. but I paid, cause another server was very nice.    
however, I won't go there anymore."}
{"text":"The menu that this place has is pretty wide with a lot of choice!  The side dishes are good and plentiful.  I like the Jajamyung since you can't get that in a lot of places in Toronto.  And the Hot Stone Bowl Bibimbap is what I crave when it's a cold outside.... YUMMM!!! :)

Saw their website here: http://phenu.com/seoraksan and the restaurant is clean with consistent service.  Definitely worth a try next time you're in the Chinatown area and hankering for korean food. :)"}
{"text":"I came here for the spicy seafood soup and it was delicious. We also had the noodles in black bean sauce. Now they need to do half and half bowls of this and we'd be in business. The spicy chicken that came with the black bean noodles were ok - too breaded though. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unpleasant experience to say the least, mostly from just straight up awful customer service. Sat down, server drops off menu and does not bring hot tea or take our order for at least 5 minutes then proceeds to sit another Korean party at a different table after us and serves them hot tea first instead. Such incompetent foolishness. It doesn't end there. Ordered two soups (soups were fine), \"BEEF\" fried dumplings for appetizer as well as a dish of spicy bulgogi. 2-3 of the dumplings came out raw, as in the flour was not cooked fully because they did not turn some over so the dough was sticky/chewy. The meat was awfully light in color, almost white and no way could it possibly have been beef. We asked the server if these were beef dumplings, to which she fake smiled and nodded her head \"yes.\" We were served pork dumplings instead and proceeded to lie to my face stating they're beef, so we politely returned the under-cooked pork dumplings. They were not happy about that. The spicy bulgogi came out steaming hot and it looked good too, too bad there was an extremely long strand of black hair right on top of the bulgogi as soon as it was set down before we even touched it. I waved at the server to tell her, she looks at the other server and rolls her eyes with a disgusted face before dragging her feet back over to our table. They took the bulgogi back, 2-3 minutes later the kitchen staff comes out to look at our table since we had returned their raw pork dumplings followed by their bulgogi with a side of wavy hair on top. We hadn't done anything wrong, yet it was such a crappy experience. Went to pay for the food upfront at the register, of course they didn't take the bulgogi off the check and tried to be slick by making us pay for it. Just save yourself the headache and go elsewhere, service is too awful and they're too ignorant to realize they're in the wrong. It's not like I ordered raw pork dumplings disguised as beef or spicy bulgogi with hair to top it off."}
{"text":"3.5*, bumped up due to HUGE portions for bbb + pbs (just under $8, ex. taxes).  

As I discovered, the problem with a large pork bone soup = Pork Bone Soup Fatigue.  You start off by diving into the morsels of fall off the bone meat, combine it with just the right amount of rice, but nearing the end of the pot, you sorta get tired of it.  :(  So if you're gonna order this dish here, make sure you come with an equally HUGE appetite!

Remember, there are also the side dishes (refillable) to contend with.  There were 7 of them for 2ppl!

Other Likes:  huge teapot of barley tea!  No need to flag the waitress down for a refill.  Pan fried beef dumplings were also yummy.  The bibimbap was apparently very good.  There were lotsa toppings and not finished in 1 sitting.

In terms of the Pork Bone Soup, it seemed less complex in flavour than others that I've had.  Broth wasn't as glowing red, but this isn't a good/bad thing, just an observation.  What I did like was that about the soup was that it wasn't a sodium overkill!

Service was very efficient, no fuss.  Food rolled out quickly.

Random question:  When there are signs in Asian restaurants that say, \"Please do not flush toilet paper down the toilet\", do you adhere to the signs??  :P"}
{"text":"the apps that comes with it (pickled cabbage, kimchi, bean sprouts, pancake, potato and jap chae noodle) was OK, entrees are OK.

i don't see the hype in this korean place. definitely not something amazing quality, just normal korean quality.

would return if i happen to be within a foot's distance. other than that, there's definitely more amazing anywhere else.

Credit card accepted over $20"}
{"text":"I always go here whenever I'm craving Korean! They have complimentary pancakes, which I love!

I've tried their bulgogi and stone pot soups, all of which were delicious. I always order spicy rice cakes, which I love as well. Sometimes i'd order spicy rice cake at other restaurants but they'd be too spicy for me, and Seor Ak San's spicy rice cakes have a nice balance of spicy."}
{"text":"It's my new favorite Korean spot! Tasty food with good sides and great value. I wish the restaurant itself was nicer/ more polished!"}
{"text":"Seor Ak San.. this place is dangerously convenient for me. After stopping in one rainy Saturday evening to try their glass noodle dish, I have been lured in multiple times. It is open until 11pm throughout the week, and the portions, and prices are all very reasonable. I have yet to veer away from their glass noodle dish, or their potato pancakes. They offer friendly and fast take out service. Although I am no connoisseur by any means of Korean food I am consistently a happy costumer. I can recommend either the glass noodle, or potato pancake options. As mentioned by others, the pancake does not come with the complimentary sides as the other dishes do. The side of sweet white potato is delicious, so it is something to consider! This place is worth checking out if you are in the mood for Korean, and in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"After coming back here a couple of times, I can confidently give this restaurant a 5/5 stars. I usually come here for the Stir Fried Rice in Stone Pot with Beef and Kimchi (image below) and the Hot Stone Pot Bibimbap with Bulgogi. Service is quick and staff is friendly. Best Korean restaurant on Spadina to grab a low cost and tasty lunch/dinner after a stressful day of classes."}
{"text":"I'd arrived in Chinatown to purchase the bestest cheapest computer keyboard I could find. Afterwards I met up with a friend in the neighbourhood. A beast of a man. A real eating machine. Not a glutton. Not a gastronome. Something in-between. Man knows how to eat is what I'm saying.

We were looking for lunch. I'm familiar with the neighbourhood and had lived there for years but left our dining selection in his capable hands. Once you leave a place you never know if your favourite place to eat has shuttered, or burned to the ground, or was shut down by health officials, or simply isn't very good anymore. You leave dining decisions to the locals, whether you're in a strange country or just the next neighbourhood over. It's common sense man!

The gastrobeast recommended \"a Korean place. It's in a basement.\" Is it grody man? \"No, it's clean. It's good. We go there all the time.\" Fine man, fine. 

We wander down the stairs and straight into Seor Ak San. The dinner room is stereotypical Chinatown. Plain tables. Cold tile floor. Handwritten multilingual menus on multicoloured posterboards. Thank the gods they don't have plastic tablecloths. And the K-Pop. Thank the gods for the K-Pop playing over the PA. No Sino adult contemporary dreck here sir!

The K-Pop continued with our server. Young man. Handsome lad. Dressed like Tom Cruise in Top Gun, down to the fur-collared leather jacket. I'm slightly wounded he's not strutting around the restaurant wearing reflective aviators. He's quick to our table with a pot of tea. This becomes a theme for our meal - stunningly quick service.

We start with potstickers. Dumplings are the true measure of a civilized cultural menu. Don't ever trust a national or regional cuisine that doesn't wrap tasty ground up stuff in a pastry and fry it. Or boil it. Or, best of all, boil and fry it.  

The gastrobeast has been here enough to have worked his way down the menu. Today he gets a sparerib soup. It comes to our table promptly and boiling hot before our appetizer is even finished. He hasn't got anywhere else to dump the rib bones from his soup and they end up competing for space with the dumplings on their platter. 

After working my way through the multi-paged menu I settled on a Hot Stone Pot Bibimbap with Spicy Squid. A good choice. It arrives more quickly than expected and, like the soup, is sizzling hot. I nibble on the kimchi and other banchan that arrive with our meal while I wait for my bibimbap to cool. Then I tear into it with my metal chopsticks. This is the good stuff. I just wish I had some more cephalopod in my bowl. 

I end my meal full and content. We talk about Kim Jong-un. A little too thematic but we'd end up talking about him no matter the venue. I let the gastrobeast have my leftovers.  He covers the now crispy rice in hot sauce. I think he liked my meal better than his own. 

I'll be back, Seor Ak San. May your Stone Pots stay forever Hot."}
{"text":"Why doesn't this place have 5 stars? 

Looks like a place where you'll walk in a grab a quick bite to eat. Nonono, be prepared for a delicious MEAL.

Amazing tasting banchans (side dishes), and almost everything on their menu is way cheaper than it should be. You're looking at average $7 an entree that will make sure you leave more than satisfied.

So my boyfriend ordred a kamjatang, I had the LA kalbi, and we also ordered the lap bok ki to share. 

Oh. My. Goodness.

The servings are ridiculous. For $11 I was expecting 6 pieces of LA kalbi, max. If I'm not dreaming still, it was a steaming platter of 10 pieces. For $7, the kamjatang was packed with beef and cooked so deliciously. 

What put an extra cherry on top was the nice Korean lady who I believe is the one who runs the place, walked around to every table to make sure everyone's meal was good and that everything was okay. That's what really put me over the top. We left so happy and wanting to eat more but couldn't.

Put it this way, even my boyfriend, who is from Korea, was super wowed by this meal.  

Affordable, great portions, delicious food, authentic Korean, great service. SERIOUSLY? If that's not as good as it gets, I don't know what is."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews, i had to go here, but it's hard to convince friends to eat in China town because of having to take street cars, trains, etc. Finally, my complaining and forcing worked. I went to Seor Ak San.....only to realize i've been there many times, just never registered the name.

I love this place. Fast service, authentic tasting food, great large menu, cheap as hell - it's a hole in the wall that's what you do when you want good food at the end of the month when you realize how much you just over spent."}
{"text":"We ordered veggies pancake, bulgogi beef dolso bibimpap with extra cheese, veggies chapchae & chicken dumplings.  Restaurant clean & food was tasty but overpriced!  Side dishes were tiny portions & refilled charge of $3.50.  Server not too attentive...had to wave to him a few times for his attention.  $50 + for a simple meal.  Was it worth the price?  Not really.  Would I go back?  Most likely NOT!!"}
{"text":"Flavourful broth, melt in your mouth meat, it was fantastic! 

Service was quick and exceptionally polite.

Restaurant was impeccably clean.

Prices are reasonable and even affordable, $7.95 for pork bone soup and $6 for beef dumplings.

I'm gonna go home and crash on this food coma..."}
{"text":"If you care a lot about decor and ambience in a restaurant, then Seor Ak San might not be the best option for you. But upon seeing the great reviews on Yelp, me and my girlfriend, we wanted to give the place a shot and see how the food tastes like. 

So we ordered Udon with Hot Spicy Beef in a hot stone bowl, beef dumplings and a spicy ramen that I can't remember the name of. All oft them tasted pretty good. I enjoyed the food, so did my girlfriend. The only con was that it was greasy, not too much, but still. Other than that, great food, the hot Spicy beef was tender and juicy, so were the noodles on the side, ramen was delicious and the beef inside was beautifully marinated. All 3 big dishes costed only 29 bucks and we were both full and happy with our meal. Good experience overall."}
{"text":"Love this place....spicy pork bone soup is my fav...only suggestion is to make it spicier!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Korean place, the service is good, one of the best Korean food I have eaten. The server is really nice. Definitely will be back if we come back to Canada."}
{"text":"This place is definitely inexpensive, and rather authentic, even down the to lower quality meat that you'd expect, but hope not for, in the dishes.

The reviews are so great here though, so I may have just ordered the wrong things: We ordered the Soon Tofu Soup with Pork and the Spicy Pork Bulgogi on metal plate.

The Tofu soup had chunks of pork that were 60% gristle and some of which had tough spots that tasted like bone. I had to spit out several pieces because I couldn't chew through them. I've never had this experience at a Korean joint and this is somewhere between number 20-40 of Korean places that I've eaten in. So, not an expert, but well versed in the Soon Tofu soup.

I had some trouble communicating my desire for a raw egg for my soup, but it was eventually understood, and gladly brought out.

The spicy pork...I have no idea what that was. It was unlike anything that I have ever been served at a korean place. Here's the thing, all the ingredients were there, though it was LOADED with vegetables instead of pork, but the flavor was COMPLETELY off. There was no spiciness to it, it was just sweet, and in a really weird sweetness way. I had two bites and couldn't eat any more of it. 

The wait staff was very kind, they asked if everything was OK when I asked for the pork boxed up after not eating any of it. I didn't have the heart to tell them that the pork was wretched.

I gave the food to a homeless person after leaving the place.

The last thing of note was that I was the only non-asian in the restaurant. That's a good thing, frankly. It makes me think that I just ordered the wrong things..."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place and this is a great alternative to the usual Chinese restaurants in the area. Their food isn't spectacular but this place is quite clean. 

I normally get the pork bone soup or dolsot bibimbap. I prefer the pork bone soup. Either the ingredients were cooked in the stone pot for long enough or it just lacked in taste but I wasn't very impressed by the bibimbap. 

However this place is usually pretty quiet and is normally frequented by students (most likely from U of T because of its proximity). Overall, it is a good choice when you are in the area but if you had a choice, I'd prefer other restaurants in koreantown."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star. Tasty Korean food in chinatown. This place is all about value of the food you get. For 15 bucks you get so much food. Porkbone soup is great. So was the rice cake. And the hotpots are awesome. It is not as good as the ones in Ktown and I know this is not high end korean food, but for the money spent I am perfectly happy."}
{"text":"Seor Ak San is one of the few positive things that comes to mind whenever people ask me about Chinatown in Toronto. The place itself is very simple with a \"homey\" vibe. 

I had ordered the Gam-Ja-Tang, which was enough to share between two people. The side dishes provided were very generous and delicious! Being someone who is nervous when eating in Chinatown, my mind was put at ease after tasting the pork bone soup. The broth was very rich and flavourful and the meat was very tender and moist. 

A very enjoyable experience; however, the food was not exceptional enough to differentiate itself among other Korean restaurants. Will definitely come back again to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting this Korean restaurant.  I'd seen photos of the food on other social media sites and thought it looked really good, so we decided to give it a try.

In order to get into the restaurant, you have to go downstairs to the basement level of the building.  It's fairly large inside with lots of tables. We were surprised that at almost noon on a Saturday, we were the first customers and worried that might be a bad sign. Our fears were unfounded though as the food was really good.

I ordered the soon dubu jjigea (tofu stew with pork and kimchi) and it arrived sizzling and bubbling, garnished with watercress and enoki mushrooms. It was absolutely delicious with just the perfect amount of heat.

My husband ordered the ox-knee soup, which also came sizzling and bubbling. It wasn't as tasty as mine and he felt it needed soya sauce and sambal oelek to make it more flavourful. However, it had lots of well-cooked tendon and sweet potato (glass) noodles. 

The restaurant was clean, the service was prompt and the server was friendly. The washrooms were also well-maintained although they had signs warning that toilet paper wasn't to be flushed down the toilets. We've seen this in other Korean restaurants and we assume it's because that's the way it's done in Korea.

The prices were very reasonable for the portions served.

We were very happy with our meals and definitely plan to return to this location to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken bibimbap and seafood pancake are amazing! The service is also fast and friendly. This has now become my go-to spot for Korean food!"}
{"text":"After walking by this place for more than a decade, I finally stopped in a couple times in the past few months. The large menu photos on the stairwell heading in always seemed enticing. 

On my first visit I had the Spicy Bulgogi Dduk Boki (rice and fish cakes in spicy sauce with bulgogi). The spice level was spot-on, and the rice cakes nice and fresh/chewy. Not the best bulgogi I've had, but still very decent. I only wish the spicy sauce was a bit thicker, like it's been in other versions of the dish I've tried. This one was a bit too watery/soupy for my tastes. The meal was also accompanied by 7 or so small appetizer plates, which was a nice unexpected touch (although I'm told common for Korean restaurants). 

On my second try I had a half-platter of the sweet and spicy chicken. From what I could tell it was just sambal sauce with some simple syrup or perhaps honey. Not the best chicken dish in the world, but completely edible. The sauce here too wasn't as thick as it could have been, making the chicken batter a bit soggy from the watery consistency.  

They also have an affordable selection of import and domestic beers, which is a nice option to have.

The staff are always very attentive to begin with, but then forget about you once the meal has been served. On both visits I had to wait a bit longer than expected for my bill, while the three otherwise unoccupied servers stared off into space."}
{"text":"Nothing else to say except I'm not sure why I only gave this place 4 stars previously.

This place has become my regular spot, I go a couple times a week for the most part.

Kimchi-chiggae and bibimbap here are top notch. Banchan is awesome and the staff are so friendly. 

Love"}
{"text":"Really delicious bibimbap here. I took a guest from out of town here and she commented how this was the best bibimbap she's ever had. The portions are huge, the ingredients are fresh, and the bowl is HOT. I was really impressed by the amount and variety of side dishes they bring you before you get your food (like the kimchi and pickled something or other).

They have a huge menu but honestly I think the next time I come back I'm still going with the bibimbap, it is that good. Next time I am entertaining guests who feel like Korean food I know exactly where I am taking them!"}
{"text":"I looked on yelp and said this place was closed on a Sunday, but I called to verify and yes they are open Sundays!

My boyfriend and I ordered the Gam Ja Tang and Soon tofu with dumplings and it was alright. The soon tofu I got was not as hot as I would like it to be. I felt that they put in the cold tofu in the broth and made it luke warm when it was served. The gam ja tang on the other hand was lacking a bit of heat and flavours. The meats on the pork bones were tender but flavourless (like it was boiled in water than added to the broth).

Overall, I'm not too enthused about this place. However the service was not bad and that's why I gave them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Nice little Korean restaurant with a diverse menu and good service. We got the Blackbean noodles and the kimchi stew with tofu, pork and sausage. The noodles were allright but the stew is delicious. The total came to $25 so it wasn't too bad for dinner for two. Overall, a good dining experience.

{"text":"Side dishes in Korean restaurants here in Toronto vary in size, quality, and quantity. Here at Seor Ak San, they give you good and plenty. I loved all the side dishes they gave us, especially the pickled cucumber and jap chae, but I ate almost everything else.

My friend and I ordered a Bibimbap and a kimchi stir-fried pork on rice. My friend said his bbp was REALLY good...I had a taste and it definitely felt like it was rightly good by the aroma. The kimchi dish had a different flavour in than the kimchi side dish and i think it was because they put a lot of hot sauce in there, which became the only flavour in the dish. It was a good flavour though (who doesn't enjoy good hot sauce). The meat quality was a bit skimp though. I have yet to find a good kimchi stir-fried pork dish since a place I went to in Waterloo, whose name i no longer recall :(

The price was cheap, less than $10/dish, and you get full. One of the best Korean places I've been to so far in this are."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, loveeeeeeeeee the food
The price is pretty reasonable 
I've tried the dumplings, LA Kali (short ribs) , jajamyun ,
Pork bone soup 
The side dishes are also very good compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"Excellent bibimbap.   The most flavorful version was served on a plate with rice on the side.  The dolsot bibimbap was delicious too; served in a hot stone pot that is hot enough to continue cooking the contents for a quarter of a minute after being served.  This is the way it should be as the rice and other ingredients (aided especially by the egg) crisp up against the sides and become the absolute best part.  The free mini dish of japje (glass noodles) was noticeably delicious.  The seafood pancake was packed with flavor and had the perfect amount of seafood.  The kimchi soonduboo chigai was delicious, but I was hoping it would be way more spicy.*  Very relaxed atmosphere.  Besides myself and two colleagues, the other diners were all Korean--a good sign if you are looking for delicious, authentic Korean food.  The servers are super nice as well!


*I like my soup HOT but I've found that Korean restaurants often serve me dishes that are less spicy than when Korean friends are dining with me. Perhaps that is what happened in this case."}
{"text":"I got the udon with spicy stirred beef with vegetables, rabokki? (dukbokki with ramen) and my sister got bimbimbap. WE ENJOYED EVERYTHING! The only thing I was not a fan of the prices, it was a bit higher than other places but other than that, I'd come back"}
{"text":"Okay food with okay price, not so much of a service because I had to wait something like 30 minutes for my food to come up. Their pork bone soup is good, and their Seafood Tofu soup tasted like it had instant ramen in it. Would come by from time to time."}
{"text":"Ordered pork tofu soup, rice cakes and pork bulgogi. Everything was packed with care and delivered pretty fast. Was delicious and will definitely re-order"}
{"text":"So disappointing! I had the tofu dolsot bibimbap and my boyfriend had the spicy chicken bulgogi dolsot bibimbap, and both were bland and tasteless. The gochuchang was far too sweet and not spicy enough, and none of the other vegetables seemed to be seasoned at all. Also, neither of our dolsot bibimbap came with an egg, which I found unusual. We also shared an order of japchae, which was better then the bibimbap albeit a little too oily. Everything comes out with a selection of banchan, which are also hit or miss -- the kimchi was terrible, and the seaweed salad had a distinctly \"fishy\" flavour, while the potatoes and bean sprouts are passable. Total for two came to around $35, which seems to be on the higher end in terms of Korean food goes in Toronto. Won't return."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the raving reviews, it's not my favourite korean spot and side dishes were also underwhelming. I got the spicy chicken bulgogi on rice and it wasn't very spicy at all. It also wasn't as steaming hot as I would've liked it to be. Perhaps the hot plate version would've been better but I won't be returning. We had a homeless person come in the restaurant while we were eating and ask for money, so it's not in a great location either..."}
{"text":"Ventured to this place on a cold evening. I've ordered the pork bone soup and may i say, it tasted very much like \"home\". The food was overall very good, but nothing out of the ordinary if I were to compare it to other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"After reading great reviews about this Korean restaurant, I decided to give it a try. For a Wednesday lunch, it was quite packed when I walked in. Since it's my first time there, I went for the traditional Korean dish - the pork bone soup, regular spicy level. I didn't really care for the side dishes as my favourites like pickled cucumber and imitation fish cakes weren't available. I usually enjoy the Korean potatoes in a sweet sauce, but the potato side dish that they served as just regular potatoes. The kimchi and pickled cabbage were quite delicious.

The piping hot pork bone soup came to my table bubbling with goodness and flavour. There was definitely more meat on the bones compared to other Korean restaurants in Chinatown. The regular spicy level was perfect for me - spicy enough that I got a tingle on my tongue, but not too spicy that I can't taste anything. The pork bone came topped with bean sprouts and cabbage, making the dish look quite interesting (and piled high). The soup was flavourful without being too salty. The meat fell off the bone, and since there was so much of it, I got to pack some for lunch tomorrow - 2 meals for the price of one!

As I was eating, I was looking around to see what other people ordered, and most people ordered the hot stone rice dishes. i will definitely have to go back and try it sometime. And to top it all off, the waiters were very attentive and offered to refill my side dishes and water without me even asking."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than a hot serving of Gamjatang (or Pork Bone Soup) on a cold winter's day.  I've been having a craving for Gamjatang and decided to look on Yelp for some suggestions that weren't too far from my work.  My search led me to Seor Ak San and it did not disappoint.  I came here for lunch and the place was pretty busy with lots of students from UofT, and with only two servers they managed to provide efficient and speedy servers.  The restaurant is located down a flight of stairs and can be easily missed if you're not keeping an eye out.  The interior is as basic as it gets, but very clean and gets the job done.  Obviously I got the Gamjatang, which it came with 6 banchan (including a serving of pancake), and all the banchan were fresh and tasty.  The Gamjatang portion was generous with lots of veggies heaped on top.  The soup was flavourful and didn't have all the bits of spices and debris that you find in some other Gamjatang soups.  After all that the bill came out to be 9 bucks including tax, you can't really beat that."}
{"text":"IIRC friend recommended the Pork Bone Soup, but I wasn't feeling it. 

Tonkatsu was too dry.

40., Soon Tofu with Beef. Collected all of the beef in the bowl and it only amounted to a tablespoon of beef. In addition, a large piece of tofu was not thoroughly cooked which was an unpleasant surprise.

7.50$ was quite expensive for the DDUK BOKI, but it was good. 

Would not order any of the above again and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Oh how I've missed good Korean food! 

I ordered the potstickers and Kalbi with a small miso soup.

When I came in it was very slow and as we were leaving there was only 3. The miso was good per usual, the potstickers were nice and crispy at the edges and the bottoms, and the Kalbi were slightly charred but still sweet which I loved.

The service wasn't the best but I was in Canada for fun and I didn't have any plans that had a time constraint so I didn't mind. The table behind me though most certainly did. I felt for them, I really did, but because I was so \"high on life\" and the change of scenery I didn't care too much.

Lastly, the restaurant looks like they did a little sprucing up on the inside (painting, new chairs etc.) but there's still signs of how they were before. (;

You'll see! Go try, the food is good."}
{"text":"Not as cheap as some of the other reviews say, but still, great food, a lot of it for what you pay, and you know those places that go overly heavy on the rice and leave you feeling like they left out a lot of veggies and meat? --they DON'T do that! 

 Yummm. Hot bowl spicy chicken bibimbap $11.50CA after tax."}
{"text":"My friend took me here after I said I was craving something Korean, delicious and cheap.  However, she used to venture here quite a while ago and I think prices may have changed a bit (so that $ might need to be changed to a $$).
Like most places located in the vicinity of China Town, it wasn't exquisite.  However, it was clean.
Needless to say, the food was delicious and the complimentary array of sides they offered was a wonderful surprise.
I'm a Bulgogi fiend.  I had the Bulgogi jungsik (~$10) which was a wonderful sizzling dish of bulgogi and veggies.  Really great flavour!  I ordered it with a side of rice because I like my carbs.
Also ordered the Hotstone Bulgogi Bibimbap (~$13).  The hot stone bowl it's served in was a super cute touch.  I liked the mixture of rice, veggies and meat, but I found it a tad dry and not as flavorful as the bulgogi jungsik.
Food was delicious, but I found that there wasn't as much meat as I'd like in proportion to veggies for both dishes.  Overall, I feel the quality and quantity of the food doesn't necessarily match what you're paying.  Hence, 4 stars."}
{"text":"Fantastically diverse menu full of delicious dishes. The pork bone stew and soft tofu stews are not to be missed! The bi bim bap is not as good as some other places. Take the opportunity to branch out and try Korean dishes you haven't had before!

The service can be dreadfully slow but they're usually quite nice. Staff is Korean and the food's mostly authentic.

The standard sides can be super delicious, but it's luck of the draw. If you're lucky you'll get one of those yummy green rice cakes! (It has the consistency of mochi.)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Korean food. Had Pork Bone soup and my sister had one of the stone bowl options. Delicious, fast, courteous service. Really great. I'm also happy that it's kinda tucked away on Spadina, down some stairs... gives it that secret appeal. Thanks for an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Got the bibimbap and seafood pancake again. The bibimbap is still delicious and the seafood pancake was good as usual. I also decided to try the pork bone stew (mild) as suggested by many here. I'm really not a fan. Maybe non-spicy is what it takes to bring out the flavour. Spicy kalbi was good but not worth the price for me. We also got some udon with seaweed and beef. I love the udon texture! Very authentic tasting but a tiny bit bland. it goes well with the spicy kalbi.

Amazing:

Bibimbap

Good:

Spicy Kalbi
Udon with seaweed and beef
Seafood pancake

Bad:

Pork Bone Stew (mild)"}
{"text":"This is a small Korean joint below a spa in Chinatown, which supposedly has some of Toronto's best bibimbap and pork bone soup.  Neither of which, unfortunately, I ended up trying on my initial lunch visit, because I have a quest of my own--namely, to find some of Toronto's best soondubu (soft tofu stew).

I picked the beef and vegetable soondubu--the tofu, being the main attraction, was hot but silky smooth, with no traces of air bubbles on the surface (a sign of overcooking, and a problem that I've encountered with some other versions of soondubu before I become an active Yelper).  The beef was a bit curled up and overcooked, and I wasn't quite sure if I could detect any vegetables in my stew, but with the tofu being so satisfying, I think I can forgive this...

Seor Ak San brought out 6 side dishes for our table--kimchi cabbage, kimchi bean sprouts, non-kimchi bean sprouts, japchae (glass noodles), potatoes and some fried nuggets which I wasn't sure was fish cakes or not (I really ought to have asked the server) but was the favourite of the side dishes.  In addition to the side dishes, the server was nice enough to bring Korean onion pancakes to our tables--very savoury and chewy, although it might get a while to get used to if you're more accustomed to crispy Chinese-style onion pancakes.

I'll likely be back again--this time to try these other things that are so highly recommended but I abandoned as part of my soondubu challenge~"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten enough bibimbap to declare Seor Ak San's the best in Toronto (and \"best X in Y\" is thrown around way too casually in Chinatown, amiright?), but I can make a few related declarations. Namely, that a) this is some tasty, tasty stuff, b) it's a fantastic quantity for under a sawbuck, and c) sweet sriacha that stone bowl remains blisteringly hot for a strangely long time. Are these bowls part uranium?

This subterranean spot on Spadina could be easy to miss so keep an eye out for the bright orange sign. I was hoping for more orange inside, but the walls are painted a weird lime-green colour. It's actually quite spacious in here, so you'd get away with bringing the whole family, a few friends, and even a few hangers on.

Service was brisk, and they were quick to replace our tea and bring out kimchi (aka gimchi, kimchee, or kim chee) and the like. When the food came out our group attacked our bowls with glee. It's certainly the best bibimap I've ever had, and I want to eat here again soon.

And Now A \"Bryan G\" Amusing Story: While we were in there, the same K-pop tune was looping repeatedly. When we casually mentioned this to the server, she misunderstood and cranked up the volume (at least I hope she misunderstood). After a few more excruciating listens, we tried again and successfully explained our plight. But she didn't know how to fix it. So -- bless her soul -- she manually selected new tracks one-by-one. DJ Bibimbap!

Go now!

Obligatory Title Pun: Their bibimbap is MOUNTAINOUS.

Menu Readability: It's actually quite well made. But just order the dolsot bibimbap would you please?

Need to mention: An extra fifty cents for a cracked egg on top.

What this place teaches me about myself: If I was a Korean DJ I would surely be DJ Bibimbap. And if I was a Korean porn star, I would surely be Kim Chee. (Star of such films at Pork Bone Superstar and Bulgogi Gangbang... (I've got more.))"}
{"text":"Oh man! I got this place off a Yelp search while in Toronto and it did not disappoint! Dirt cheap prices, real yummy food.  I got a parking ticket though, for my motorcycle which barely took up any room in the stupid \"no parking\" zone which I hadn't readily noticed.
I had some kind of stew.  It really doesn't matter, I came back, had something different, and it was all real yummy! Get here hungry, eat your butt off, and pay very little!!!"}
{"text":"Been here for the first time, and had the Pork Bone Soup ( Hot Pot). It was really good, the spice was just at the right amount and fills 2 people comfortably. The waiters and servers were very friendly and checked on tables to see if everything was ok. Good service! Definitely will go back again and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"There is no greater moment than discovering that the steaming hot green onion pancake the server delivered to you - which you thought was a mistake - turned out to be free and you get all jittery and excited because this is your first time at this korean restaurant and you already have food on your table and the side dishes haven't even arrived yet!!!

All dishes come with a set of four side dishes: glass noodles, marinated potatoes, kimchi, and seaweed salad. Out of the four of us, we ordered the dolsot bibimbap with bulgogi (regular and spicy), as well as the pork bone soup.

The green onion pancake - a bit oily, but a very soft and tender texture (as most Korean grilled pancakes are). It was a little bland to me; the green onion/egg flavour didn't wasn't really noticeable. But overall it was a very warm precursor to the cold dishes.

The kimchi - to me, the kimchi didn't seem to be prepared fresh from the kitchen every day. It had some sort of pre-packaged taste to it, nonethless it was still pretty good. Don't trust my tastebuds on this one.

The seaweed salad - probably the highlight of the four side dishes. The thing with seaweed salads is that the seaweed not only has to be sliced in such a manner that diners don't have to frantically chew the dish, but also the dressing cannot be too acidic (which is often the case many restaurants). This seaweed salad fulfilled both of my set expectations.

Didn't try the marinated potatoes. Wasn't digging potatoes that day.

Bibimbap - super flavourful. The restaurant gave a generous serving of both vegetables and bulgogi. There was a really nice balance between the sweetness of the korean barbecue beef and the organic taste of the vegetable toppings. I couldn't even finish half and I was already full. Really good deal.

Pork bone soup - the pork bones were definitely there. The broth was really rich, and again, they were very generous with the vegetables in the soup. This dish also came with purple barley rice .

The friendly service, the tasty food, and the authentic atmosphere of the restaurant merits Seor Ak San four stars. Thanks Seor Ak San!"}
{"text":"it was friday night, not too crowded but plenty of people to serve still. I ordered (waited some time to order) then waited maybe 15min for the meal to be served together w appetizers. the appetizers were bland, the meal was a bit tasteless too. nothing much else to say about the experience. I ate here once before w my husband, we had bibimbap. this time I had bulgogi ricecake in soy sauce, the sauce was really weak. no idea if it would be worth to return, $14 incl tax and tip is way too high for this experience.
2.8/5 (bibimbap was better, more like 4/5 if I remember correctly so altogether above 3)"}
{"text":"This place is a little bit hidden in the basement on Spadina. They were actually quite busy to my surprise. The crowd inside was also pretty loud. They quickly served us the side dishes and rice. It was typical of any other Korean restaurant. I had their pan fried chicken dumplings and bibimbap. The pan fried dumplings were really oily that I had to pat down the oil with a napkin before eating it. After patting, it didn't taste bad, but it wasn't great. The bibimbap portion was quite large. Again, nothing really stood out. 

Overall, just a not very memorable experience. Service, food, price was all very average."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night with my girls and it was pretty quiet which was surprising to me given the high rating on Yelp. Located in a homey basement  unit in the heart of Chinatown, they have all the offerings of a typical Korean restaurant. 

I was disappointed with the Pork Soondubu Chigae though, it was really underwhelming, bland and didn't have the spicy kick I always crave for. Seems like I should have ordered the Gamjatang (Pork Bone Soup) as others have mentioned it packed more flavour. However, the cheesy ddubbokki is solid - I would definitely recommend trying it!

Though it was my first time here, I think I'll be heading back to Koreatown or Yonge/Finch for more authentic and bolder flavours. I'd recommend trying out Yummy Korean Food Restaurant instead if you want the real deal."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean restaurant in the whole world!! A true hidden gem. Feels like you're eating food made with love by a true Korean mom. Delicious, lots of variety, fairly priced, nice homey atmosphere. I love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was excellent! Very attentive and courteous! My cousin really enjoyed the food as this was his first time eating Korean food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch here today with a friend and baby. They were SUPER nice about the baby and did everything they could to make us comfortable. And, of course, the food was wonderful. We both had bibimbap (mine tofu) that we really enjoyed. All the free starters were delicious."}
{"text":"I had the Kimchi/Beef Tofu Soup (Soondabu chigae) here and it was pretty good. Service was surprisingly fast though I did go at a pretty late hour. The appetizers were decent and tasty and I think the whole bill ended up being 10 with tip. 

Definitely will try something else next time as other reviewers have pointed out some other really good dishes as well."}
{"text":"I had gam ja tang here the other night and at the risk of getting my Yelp card taken away...I liked the one at Ka Chi better. 

The version here had a very low \"water level\" - the pot was only half full. I was able to finish it, which is great, but I was used to getting a bigger portion somewhere else, you know?

The second main issue was that there was less meat and the meat was less accessible. By that I mean at Ka Chi, the meat was practically melting off the bones - the tendons and everything were all gooey and delicious. At Seor Ak San, the bones clearly weren't boiled as long so I really had to wrestle with the bones to get to the meat - and I often lost. :P It could be that I came here earlier in the day than I went to Ka Chi...but the difference was huge. The Ka Chi bones could easily be lifted away and the meat was SO tender. 

The version here was good - I was relieved that it wasn't too spicey for a wimp like me (there was no mild option). Plus the prices were very, very reasonable. Service was alright. No air conditioning in the restaurant kind of took away from the experience. I will say though, that I had the best japchae banchan I'd ever had here!"}
{"text":"I always have the bulgogi and bibimbap..and its always great.
Do not go here expecting an amazing ambience, or a cutural experience - but do expect great Korean food."}
{"text":"Decided to break from my normal Korean lunch tradition of Ka-Chi and try Seor Ak San for their Pork Bone Stew in order to get a little change and see if I was missing something. 
I had done my research first and heard this place had the best Pork Bone Stew around, well.... I'm gonna have to disagree, sorry Seor Ak San but Ka-Chi still has you beat in that department but you are a very close second. Price was right flavor was really good and as with Ka-Chi you guys have a nice variety of Banchan (the small snack side dishes that come with all Korean food)
I will definitely be back to Seor Ak San but next time it will be to try all the other wonderful dishes that they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Pork bone soup, mild spicy. That's what I had, pretty bland without the spiciness actually.. But still very sweet and delicious. I loved it. I love rice + Korean soup. That, and bibimbap.

My friend ordered the beef bibimbap, it was amazing. He added a lot of hot sauce to his, and it turned out perfect. It was quite spicy for me, but you just can't have bibimbap without that!!

The service was very quick. It was a weekday evening, not packed so we were there for about three hours!

It's a little hard to find, it's downstairs on the East side of Spadina. It's a clean place, food comes fast, and the waitress makes sure to fill our pot with hot tea!"}
