{"text":"Great place to eat. Love their chips and green salsa. Burritos are huge and full of flavor. Tacos are great also. The staff is friendly and always makes you feel welcome. 
Worth the drive if your not close by."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great customer service! Everyone there makes sure my food is to my liking and it's a very inviting environment!"}
{"text":"Love this place with one exception. They use chopped romaine lettuce on tacos, tostadas, ect. I prefer iceberg like their other location. Call me a traditionalist."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this spot. The food is authentic & tasty. The family atmosphere makes ya feel so welcomed & part of the family. Can't go wrong with eating here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burritos I've ever had! Originally tried them out when my boss took me out to lunch (I'm never one to turn down a free meal), and I was blown away! I ordered the Rudys burrito with everything on it and it was AMAZING!! So good that I've since come back about once a week since! Portion sizes are large and you definitely get your money's worth! They even have ice cream and other sweet treats in addition the the usual chips and salsa options. You must try this place!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when this place opened. We've been frequenting Rudy's other location closer to home for years and was happy to see them being successful. This place has a large dining room (and a liquor license) and an expanded menu. I usually keep getting the Rudy's Bowl but everything I've tried is really good."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Iowa, and it's the only Mexican restaurant I have loved since moving here. The town I moved from has a Mexican restaurant that's rated Top ten in USA for authentic Mexican food and this place defiantly compares! Great service, large portions, and it was delicious!! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Hmmm.  My mom and I came here expecting good mexican food and we left with nothing but a bad stain on our seat. We decided to try the pork tamales and the California burrito.  They asked us if we wanted red or green sauce on the tamales, and we told them sure, \"red\".  When we received the food it seemed very light in the bag but we were hungry so that didn't matter as much.  We left, walked outside,  and got into the car.   My mom thought we should check the food, and when we did we found a tiny tamale in a bath of red sauce(oily red sauce) leaking out of a Styrofoam container.  Sure enough it got all over the seat.  Obviously,  we were frustrated, and we walked inside to get our money back.  They told us tamales take hours and hours to make,  and that we wanted red sauce.  How stupid can you be?"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good reviews so I was expecting more than this. I've had their burritos and they were pretty good. Got the chicken enchilada and carne asada taco plate. Chicken was dry and tasteless, as was the tortilla, sauce was weak. Carne asada was OK, but tough, and the taco shell was straight out of the old el paso box. Refried beans were thick, pasty and blah, they really skimped on the cheese, which was blah, rice was only fair. Red salsa had a musty, bitter, old aftertaste. Jamaica was really good! I've had better Mexican at a roadside Cafe in Montana. It was truly the worst Mexican combo plate I can remember. Won't be going back... Ever."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Tortillas taste raw . Barely a step up from taco bell. Taco shells could be from taco bell. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"For my first time there, I found it to have a whimsical atmosphere, cute paintings and a very casual environment.  I ordered the three chicken enchiladas, however;  after enjoying one of the three I found no chicken in it I took it to the counter and the server was so apologetic and with in a few short moments they brought me a dish with plenty of chicken in it.  I was so full I had to get a togo box, so be hungry, portions are good sized!  We will go back to see how the other items taste because my food tasted very good this time."}
{"text":"Great people serving very good food. They also have awesome lunch specials. The shreeded  bee tacos and the chili rellenos are among the best in town ."}
{"text":"Really good inexpensive Mexican food! I prefer it over the likes of Filibertos. I absolutely recommend the Bodybuilder Burrito."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The restaurant was very clean and inviting. The young lady at the counter was happy and helpful. It was our first time at Rudy's and my daughter was asking about their rice. She offered my daughter a sample of the rice. My daughter loved the rice and the beans are wonderful. My husband tripped their Super burrito. Very tasty and filling. I will definitely come back to Rudy's."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this gem. Oh my gosh this is the best damn food and very fairly priced. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Clean fun environment ! Quick yet accuracy is on point . Breanna is very enthusiastic and could brighten up anyone's day with her sweet personality and welcoming smile! I'm glad I stopped here to pick up food for lunch today. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Nope.  Won't go back.  The chile relleno was just average and the chimichanga tasted like a big ball of grease.  Husband deemed it \"almost disgusting\".  Also not too keen on the plasticware.  Try cutting a chimichanga that's been over fried on one side with a plastic knife.  The salsa was watery, as was the flavorless green sauce.  Sorely disappointed.  Our quest for GOOD, authentic Mexican food continues."}
{"text":"Man this place is awesome the food here is soooo good!! I absolutely love the Rudy's burrito, I get it pretty much every time. The guacamole is really good too. They have very good service each time. The fancy coke soda fountain is a real plus too."}
{"text":"Visited on Wednesday for FISH TACO WEDNESDAY ($0.99).  Not the best tacos, but worth the price.  I would say they are two steps below Rubios but better than fish stick tacos.  The salsas were pretty decent, the red has some great kick.  Loved their soda machine, one of those fancy choose-your-flavor Coke machines."}
{"text":"Omg! Delish is all I can say! I had the Arizona burrito and it was chucked of wonderfulness!. This Rudy's is the one on Sossaman and Hawes. It is far better that the one by Albertsons. Very very clean, unlike the other Rudy's, I stopped going there because of it. As I entered the restaurant, there were 2 young ladies cleaning and sanitizing the counter tops and even the front of the cabinets! So I was happy right off the bat! At this location you also get free chips and salsa's so I'm sold! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"We love Rudys on Ellsworth and Baseline so we thought we would try the new place. It did not disappoint,the food was great and atmosphere was inviting. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good and A LOT of menut items to choose from and a few items I've never seen offered at other similar restaurants. It's counter service but they bring the food to you and you get chips and salsa on them! Breakfast bowls, breakfast scrambles, Surf n Turf burritos - 14 diff burrito choices!! And the prices are very reasonable. The dining area is clean and the staff is very friendltly and makes you feel like they appreciate your business. Why not 5 stars? Nothing's perfect. ;-)"}
{"text":"We love Rudy's on Ellesworth & Baseline. We've ate Rudy's for 10 years. The new location does not disappoint. Personally,  I don't know if I like the particular spot they are at, ONLY because if Rudy had not told me they were opening there, I would not have known they were there?! Inside the parking lot there are so many trees, I couldn't even see their sign until I was right up on it. 
From Guadalupe, you have NO CHANCE of knowing his place is there, or, seeing his sign, because of the trees.
Food was excellent. 
I would create better signage."}
{"text":"Very good!!!
I happened to show up on the day the health inspector showed up lol.
I ordered The Rudy Burrito. Very big and very good.
The girl that took my order was super nice and shes the owners daughter. Chips and salsa are gratis.
The inspector seemed impressed with the joint as well.
$7.57 with water cup and chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Previously my wife and I would occasionally go to Filibertos until we moved on to Los Favoritos and then most recently became frequent Rubio's go-ers. But Rudy's really has the best of all worlds. Top quality ingredients are always fresh (you know it's the real deal when you can actually see avocado in the guacamole), reasonable prices (something I think we can all agree that Rubio's lacks), and overall great service (every meal is accompanied with chips and salsa, served family style if there's more than 1 at a table). The first time we at here, we were so in love with that food that we came back the next day  to try out their breakfast burritos, which DO NOT disappoint. Also, they offer $0.99 fish tacos on Wednesday! Honestly the fact that their ingredients always taste to fresh and the food feels so homemade alone, warrants 5 stars. If you're in the area, I highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Mexican dishes made with fresh ingredients, you need to try Rudy's Mexican Grill.  Same family that owns this location also owns Rudy's Burrito's.  This location is great!  They have beautiful decor and flat screen tv's around the restaurant.  Their Rudy's Special Burro, tamales, and carne asada fries are to die for.  Prices are reasonable too!  I would recommend this restaurant to my family and friends."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in East Mesa, definitely would recommend. Everything it good, especially their salsa. Prices are very fair for the quality you get. Only criticism is sometimes the horchata is a little off but that's nominal to the quality, portion, and value you get. It's very hard to find good Mexican food in this part of town and I'm very happy I found them."}
{"text":"We love this Rudy's Burritos so we decided to try this one.  The service is prompt and friendly with a quaint environment. They have a red or green sauce, we are both fans of the green. 

The food tends to be hit and miss for us. One time the carnitas is delicious, tender and flavorful. The next time, we didn't finish it because it wasn't very good. My husband usually loves carne asada but said its just average here. I've had the chicken too. It's good but nothing special. 

We might need to make a trip their sister location next time."}
{"text":"I am of Mexican descent the food that I ordered was very tasty but the beans were not homemade it seems like it came from a can tasted more like Rosarita in a can."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in the area! Food is delicious, price is reasonable, and service is great.  Very clean too!

Breakfast burritos are amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here based on other reviews...You order at the counter & then food is brought to your table. Margaritas were great, food was bland. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic green sauce. So good. I normally get the fajitas. Burritos are great. Tortillas are amazing. Although I don't eat many carbs. Beans and rice great. Just can't say enough good about Rudys. Thanks for the great service guys."}
{"text":"Great food.  We will be back for sure.  Went here tonight with my husband and son.  We all got something different and we all loved what we got.  Son got a breakfast burrito and said it was the best he has had."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff is super nice. They have a really good menu with lots of options. The food we have gotten here is so delicious and it's a restaurant like feel without the wait. We will be back! Perhaps regularly! :)"}
{"text":"Would have been good, but something seemed to be missing............ flavor! Service was quick and the staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Went for take-out lunch. Had the taco salad which was fresh and tasty. Would have liked more salsa. Hubby had jumbo burrito which he stated was tasty."}
{"text":"Cool little family run place. Order at the counter and they bring food to your table. Nice little Mexican ambiance too. Great for a quick bite. They have beer and sangria too!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Yum. 

We stopped in to try this place near my parents new house. Soooo glad we did!

We had a chicken quesadilla which was out of this world!  The fresh flour tortilla was PERFECT - a little crunchy a little chewy!

Plus a carne asada and a fish taco. These were both SOOOO good. Finally also ordered a pork tamale which was our least favorite but was still outstanding. Everything else was just other level yummy!!  We even went back for a dozen fresh tortillas to take home. 

The prices here are reasonable, the serving sizes generous and the food was as mentioned - 
Oh. My. Yum.

As a bonus, the staff was really fast, helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I love Fillibertos as much as the next guy, but Rudy's is a great alternative. Totally unique flavors and great portion sizes. You won't leave hungry. The place is very clean with nice decor. Rudy the owner is also very nice. The green salsa is one of my favorites valleywide! Give this place a try!!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to come, whether it's for breakfast, lunch or dinner! Their chips and salsa are a great way to start off the meal and their breakfast burritos are to die for. My favorite is the ham and egg burrito. Their tortillas are handmade and delicious as well; we like to bring them home! Oh! And if you like Coke Freestyle machines, they've got one!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and thought this must be awesome. I was very disappointed. It's cafeteria style, you eat with plastic utensils.  The cashier was very nice. The food was tasty, but very salty.  The chips were all broken and not warmed. The salsa's were watery and pretty tasteless. I had a cheese and bean burrito which came with no ranchero sauce on it. When I asked for sauce I was told its $1.50 extra!  For sauce? Are they joking? And it turns out the sauce wasn't even good!  
I'll stick with Rio Rico Mexican Grill in Gilbert.  I've been going there for 8 years (since I moved to AZ) and everything is awesome there!  You also don't get charged extra for sauce or salsa and chips there!"}
{"text":"I just met the Breakfast burrito of my dreams and her name is The Bronco Burrito!  Steak, potatoes, amazing cheese, obviously fresh cuts of avocado, rolled up and deep fried in a delicious flour tortilla package.  I ordered mine smothered in red sauce, which was also super good and obviously hand crafted.  This place earned their five stars for sure, I'll be back without question!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! Have been there many times and I keep going for many reasons! Service is great! Food is awesome!!! Atmosphere and cleanliness is great!!! Always love when u go back and get the same excellent customer service and food quality each time!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have started coming here on the weekend for some delicious Mexican food! We have only been a few times but love the food! We think it's fairly priced and the portions aren't SUPER huge. The staff is super friendly and helpful, the restaurant is kept very clean, and there is plenty of seating without feeling crowded. They have the soda machine that has a tremendous number of flavors as well, which is always a great find! My personal favorite menu item is the chimichangos appetizer!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito in the valley! The tortillas are huge and homemade and every ingredient is fresh. I'm so thrilled at their new location on Guadalupe and Hawes. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Everyone here is friendly and nice! Love the new location it's much bigger which makes it comfortable. I always enjoy the food here."}
{"text":"My family and I love Rudy's everything is always fresh and delicious. Well worth the drive and they never disappoint. Everything on their menu is made to perfection. Wish they had more locations closer to me."}
{"text":"They make delicious street tacos, and their Horchata and Jamaica drinks are amazing! The staff is friendly, and they are quick to have your order ready."}
{"text":"Since we heard about this place from my daughter 2 years ago, we have tried Rudy's food 3 to 4 times. We started as take- out, because the original store was small. Then we ordered to eat at the new location several times. Each time we went was usually last minute decision; it seems this place has become our default comfort food destination.  When you get there, customers order from a wall menu with a staff at the counter. You pay for the selections and they will serve your food at the table later. Grab your utensils before you sit down, and a staff would usually offer house chips and salsa before the meal. The place is brightly colored and cheerful. They do have a patio for dining outdoors. They have a mini Coke soda mixing machine, so you can mix your drinks the way you like. My hubby and I love their food. You name it, we love it. Especially their home made red sauce. They also have menudo.  Yum! My daughter loves their burrito. That is her go-to."}
{"text":"Wow!  If you are looking for a complicated plate of food, this is not the spot for you.  If you are looking for simple great tasting Mexican food, this is the spot!  Descriptions on the menu are spot on, don't like something, just ask them not to put it on.  I had super burrito with refried beans(you have 3 options) and it wasn't too big and not too small, just the right size and outstanding flavor!  My wife he surf and turf, it tasted great!  Chipotle sauce in it is something I've been looking for.  If put it up there against most Southern California burrito spots, it's that delicious!  We will be back."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Rudy's original location for years and it's been a family favorite since day one.

This new location is even better than the first with Rudy's family recreating home cooked style fresh  Mexican Food that will have your tummy and tastebuds very very grateful!

My family and I highly recommend Rudy's Mexican Restaurant to family, friends and you!"}
{"text":"Their hot salsa and tortillas will bring me back alone!  I could live on these.  I've eaten their breakfast burritos and they're awesome.  Customer service is excellent.  Can't wait to try their fish tacos!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little place. Good food and atmosphere. Was tempted to give 4 stars but the customer service really came through for us. At first they got our order wrong - gave us a bean and cheese burrito when I asked for a California burrito. They didn't hesitate to switch it out at no extra cost! Will definitely come back again in the future."}
{"text":"So - the reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is solely based on Wednesday.99¢ fish tacos - I'm super spoiled from living in San Diego and Rosirito, but for the middle of the desert this place is doing pretty good - the chipotle cream sauce they use on the tacos is great a compliment to the crunchy fish  - and feeding my family of 4 for $20 is also a nice treat"}
{"text":"What happened!?! Every time we come the food is so good. Today was a major disappointment. 
Nachos were bland. Grilled chicken was rubbery. Chips weren't completely cooked. Soggy with oil. 
They gave my food to someone else that ordered food to go. Then we just watched everything go down hill from there. Orders were getting lost left and right. 
When I got my burro it was hot and tasty at least and the woman apologized. 
Young new girl taking the orders was mixing things up. Didn't know the menu or the food for that matter. Sadness."}
{"text":"4.5 stars really. Consistently decent food at a reasonable price. Definitely better than the ..Berto places; food tastes fresher. This location is nicer and cleaner than the Ellsworth location. Staff is always super nice."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! We come every weekend, it's a 20mins drive, but totally worth it. The staff is super nice and friendly, clean establishment, amazing food! Thank you for this place!"}
