{"text":"Great pizza from a family owned shop. Good pizza consistency--the crust is not too thin, the bottom is crispy yet the pizza is chewy. Be forewarned their pepperoni is smaller than any other pizza I have ever had. Overall, my family and I love this place."}
{"text":"We only tried Bishop's pizza once and we were very disappointed! Fried pickles were burnt and tasted like they were cooked in very old oil with old pickles. Yuck, not appealing AT ALL! And charged us $12 for a small buffalo chicken pizza that was more like a personal pizza. I don't think we'll be going back :("}
{"text":"The Spinach Calzone  Me and my wife order from Bishops Pizza quite frequently. There pizzas are great, we love the White Supreme, but there regular red sauce pizza is equally as delicious. Everything tastes like good product, not canned, if that makes sense too you. Plus they deliver ice Cream.........nuff said!  But on to the review of the SPINACH CALZONE!  EFF GREAT, that is my review. I'm a self proclaimed spinach connoisseur, so this is a top notch cal-zon-e! I have  ordered spinach calzones from everywhere. My other top spinach calzone is Angie's in Wilmerding, but I think they just got leapfrogged by Bishops.   If your into SPINACH, you'll love this calzone. Crack open the calzone, lil salt, lil pepper.......and bingo....BOMB!  -jedi approved-"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza for delivery. They got to us pretty quick. The pizza was delicious. It blew Domino's and Pizza Hut away."}
{"text":"Great fresh pizza , ordered for delivery, arrived quickly and hot. I frequent Bishop's Pizza they have the best food. They moved to a bigger place with a dining room. I say give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were searching for a pizza shop on a drive from Sandusky to my in-laws house in N Huntington and found Bishop's on Yelp!  The pizza was great and the people were nice. We fed 8 people for $35 and everyone loved the food. Well done Bishop's!"}
