{"text":"We decided to eat breakfast here before our round at The Talkingstick Golf Course.  Not too bad.  I had a create your own omelette with jalapenos, sausage, and cheese and hubby had biscuits and gravy.  Everything was good and the service was quick and friendly.  It was what you would expect at a golf course restaurant."}
{"text":"There are two types of people in this world - there's golfers, and then there's people who don't golf. When golfers are golfing, there's really no way for the non-golfers to partake in the fun ... unless the links have a clubhouse restaurant like Wildhorse Grill at Talking Stick Golf Club.  Then, one group can hang back, noshing on nachos, wings, dogs, and stuff, while the swingers do their thing. The beauty of this scenario taking place at Talking Stick Golf Club's Wildhorse Grill, however, is that food, truly, is not only some of the best golf course food around, it's some of the best food around. Period.  Their Machaca Beef Nachos are definitely in our Top 3 Nacho choices in town. Fresh tortilla chips come piled high with chunky pico de gallo, large slices of avocado, sour cream, jalape√±o cheese sauce, and other accoutrements along with the star of this dish: slow-braised machaca that's shreddy to perfection. There's also Angus beef and brisket sliders, topped with roasted green chiles, sauteed onions, and melted cheddar cheese on jalapeno cheddar rolls.  The Vienna Beef hot dog is close to a Chicago classic, with relish, onion, and mustard, but diverts from the Windy City with ketchup and it's clothing in a potato roll. But chili and cheese can be added, making this baby absolutely phenomenal.  In the mood for something more Southwest, then try the Quesadilla-- roasted chicken, green onion, mango, pepper jack, caramelized onion, and avocado (pictured.)  We also recommend the Philly Cheese Steak (with an option of smoked turkey instead of the typical thinly sliced rib eye) that includes bell peppers, satueed onions, mushrooms, and white American cheese, all on a fat bolillo roll. We haven't had the carne aside torta, but trends tell us that this sandwich is a winner, with guacamole, pico de gallo, jalapeno mayo, iceberg lettuce, and cotija cheese, all on a telera roll.  If all this is sounding like a gut bomb, then opt for the SW Salmon Caesar, which serves up blackened salmon and chopped romaine hearts with grilled corn, tomato, jicama, housemade croutons, cotija cheese, and chipotle Caesar dressing.  So even though there are two Arnold Palmer Golf Management courses at Talking Stick, there's honey chipotle wings at Wildhorse Grille. Our advice? Put down the clubs, forego the 18, and join your foodie friends in the clubhouse. You'll end up with one of the best golf clubhouse meals in the Valley.  (Review from EaterAZ.com)"}

{"text":"No, this is not near Wild Horse Pass, this restaurant is located at the Talking Stick Golf course in Scottsdale. Happy Hour is from 11- 2 or 3 PM.  After a round of golf, our group decided to have lunch and to our surprise, the servings were a plate full. I had the Club, my friends had the Sliders, Chicken Wrap and last, a burger. The server made sure we had enough water and beer. All the entrees come with one side and I opted for the Home Chips and the others, french fries. For the value, the Chicken Wrap during happy hour was $5 which large enough for me to enjoy compared to my Club.  Everyone was happy and we left stuffed."}
{"text":"This place is a well kept secret in Scottsdale. It is the restaurant for the golf course in the back of Talking Stick, but is open to the public. Good food, never crowded and fast friendly servers. Even in the winter at 10 am there is no wait for a table"}
