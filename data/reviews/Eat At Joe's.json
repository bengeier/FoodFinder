{"text":"Love this place!  Before I moved away several years ago, my family and I use to have breakfast here every weekend.   Very basic and tasty breakfast food... super inexpensive also!"}
{"text":"\"Great breakfast, good service at a price you can't beat! Definitely coming back. Solid breakfast diner, don't be discouraged by location at the back of a CVS store\""}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets on the east side. Affordable breakfast/lunch fare with quick service. I love how you can get 2 eggs, ample hash browns, toast, ham/sausage/bacon, and a bagel for 7 bucks.  You can be in and out in 20-25 minutes most days.  Love the fluffy omelets and the Philly Cheese-steak too."}
{"text":"This is it. This is what you get in a Midwestern, suburban diner, and for what it is, it's good. Don't come here expecting a high-end experience: you get the eggs, you get the toast, you get the coffee from a can, and you deal with the fact that your pancakes will taste like pancakes with corn syrup and not much else. It's good food for its price point - cheap.  The place is often pretty busy and the atmosphere is clean and bright. The staff is quick and thorough and seems to always come off as nice instead of rushed or stressed. It's a good community staple in a town that sometimes feels stretched out."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food for an unbeatable price! Beyond reasonable prices for the standard breakfast fare. You can get a 3 egg omlete with swiss cheese and ham, toast and crispy hash browns for 5.99. The wait can be long at time because it does have a small seating area, but the staff are efficient and the food is good, so I don't mind the wait. I'd recommend it to all who are over on the east side!"}
{"text":"I tried this place because of the great reviews but that was a bad decision. I got a standard breakfast, eggs, bacon and hash browns. The eggs were half cooked at best. They were incredible soupy. I didn't even take one bite of them. Hash browns are so crispy and covered in grease that you can't even taste the potato. Not to mention they take cash only. Look...we get it. You're an old fashioned diner. But seriously, making your patrons walk to the gas station to get money out because you don't even have the decency to have an atm is ridiculous. Get the credit card machine and move on with your life. All around not a good experience."}
{"text":"Very good food friendly staff and fairly priced. Just make sure you bring cash. Because it's a cash only place"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cheap and amazing breakfast. This is the spot to go. 8-1030am is jumping so be ready to wait lol"}
{"text":"Two weeks ago, as a treat, I took my boys to a popular, pricey breakfast place in Tremont that had been featured on TV.  The food there was overly salty, pretentious, and ridiculously expensive.  What a waste.  None of us ate half of our meals.  Today, we went back to Eat at Joe's for about the third time.  We wiped our plates clean: fluffy eggs, fantastic hash browns, excellent bacon, and perfect French toast served quickly by the friendly staff--for a third of the cost of the pretentious place.  Plus, we parked 10 feet from the door.  You can go to Tremont and pay for that BS if you want to, or you can go to Eat at Joe's, have great food, and put your money toward hard-working, unpretentious folks."}
{"text":"Joe's is just a solid spot with no frills, good food and nice staff. For $5 you can get a 3 egg omelet or eggs Benedict. The only thing is the wait on the weekend. I promise, it's worth it."}
{"text":"First of all everyone should know that this place is INSIDE of CVS, well actually it is in the SAME building on the side.  There is no sign, just the name of the place on the window.   Okay, now that we have finally found the restaurant, this is our opinion....     And it is CASH ONLY...for all of you that are like me and live on my plastic cards...be prepared to pay real money!    It is an old time diner atmosphere with the black and white checkerboard floor and the counter that you can sit at too!  The food was good and hot and came out fast!!  The server was great and kept up with our coffee refills.        The food tasted good and the prices were a little lower than average.  We will definitely go back when we are in the area....but I would not drive out of my way to go there.         We liked the atmosphere and the people too.  So all in all if you are around the area you should definitely stop at Joe's!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is family owned and operated, providing the perfect diner atmosphere! The food is delicious and goes great with a hot cup of coffee. Meals are fresh, cooked to order. Soups are made in house daily. Portions are large while keeping costs low. This diner never disappoints!   Notes:  -cash only -take out available  -no reservations   Recommendations: -hash browns!  -breakfast sandwich -coffee"}
{"text":"Diner vibe, diner prices, excellent food. Breakfast menu is pretty standard but everything is executed wonderfully and super tasty. Hashbrowns are so crisp, holy shit i just want a giant plate of them and a bottle of franks. Prices are crazy low and service was great."}
{"text":"Classic neighborhood breakfast and lunch spot. Great eggs Benedict. Low prices, friendly service, unassuming decor."}
{"text":"This place fills up during the weekends, and for good reason. Food is good, but what really shines is the affordability. Probably has something to do with the location (it's behind a CVS), but unless you're looking for a fancy brunch, this is a wonderful gem.  Remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"This place was a great find, every star on Yelp was well deserved. I had a spinach, mushroom, and cheese omelette that was cooked perfectly.  The staff was great and always kept my coffee full. The price was unbeatable and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Hard to see because the only signage is on the window.  My scrambled eggs were undercooked, but the bacon was solid. Food is reasonably priced, and the down home feel of a local diner is a distinct positive."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! The staff are great people and the food is beyond delicious! Get there early because it gets busy fast! Overall, a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best no gimmicks breakfast. Eggs are always done to perfection. Toast is golden brown. Good quality food, for low prices."}
{"text":"I came to the restaurant and could not eat breakfast. The service was rude. The menu is basic. It did not include ANY gluten free option. It said no substitutions everywhere. I wanted warm skim milk with my coffee, they did not have skim milk and they could not warm the whole milk. They only had one sugar substitute. I mean, they are so inflexible that you can only eat here if you like very standard food, and if you don't have any allergy. I had brought my own gluten free bread, but the waitress had so much personality that I felt if I ask her to toast it for me, she would hit me. I am not coming back."}
{"text":"This diner has really gone downhill. My friend's grilled chicken sandwich was burned (black). When she pointed it out to the server, she said there is no point in sending it back because they all look burned due to the ranch dressing that is used. That makes no sense. My toast was spongy because it was soaked in butter. I asked for toast without butter and the same server yelled, \"You complain about everything!\" She must have mistaken me for someone else because I have never complained about anything. She said \"If you want another order of toast, you'll have to pay for it!\" I said never mind. Then she screamed \"I'll never wait on you again.\" She clearly was having a meltdown, but no one from management intervened. She was screaming from behind the counter, and rambling on about having a bad day. A couple eating at the table next to us said \"There is something wrong with her!\" She eventually apologized, but it was very uncomfortable to be in a situation like that.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"The best dive breakfast place after a night of drinking at dive bars. There's really no other breakfast menu better to start your weekend. The food is unparalleled to any other place and the prices are lower than if you had to actually make breakfast hung over at home. All of these traits make it a staple and make up for only accepting cash and being crowded. I wish there were more places like this"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Inexpensive and quality. Service was a little slow but they were so busy!"}
{"text":"Okay, you want small, basic, TASTY and no frills; Eat at Joe's is your kind of place.   Done up with pics of old boxers and an atmosphere of \"come in and set a spell\", Eat at Joe's serves a very basic menu full of inexpensive fare that you'd find in any corner eatery from here to Saskatoon. 3 egg omelets, nice pancakes, simple sandwiches, this place is good for those on a no-frills budget.   Located behind a CVS, the little diner is always bustling and is a solid Breakfast/Lunch place. I think their hours are only till 2 PM, but it's worth it to stop in. Parking is decent. One things; bring CASH. No credit, no checks. That's all they take. Also, you may have a wait as this little place is always hopping from the first click of the lock to the last.   If you want a quick, tasty bite at a place that won't gobble up your wallet, then...EAT AT JOE'S! ;)"}
{"text":"Great diner, great prices, good diner food. Every town or city needs a place like this!"}
{"text":"I love Eat at Joe's!  It's a great place to stop in for breakfast or lunch (they aren't open for dinner).  The specials change frequently but some items that are always on the menu that are definite favorites are the Eggs Benedict and the Club Sandwich.  But, really, everything I've had there is good!  Prices are very affordable and the serving sizes are generous. It's a small dining area so you may have to wait a bit for a table.  On the flip side, please be considerate if you see a line and leave when you've finished your meal.  The waitresses are all incredibly nice and work very hard.  One thing to keep in mind -- it's a cash only business so be sure to bring some cash!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time deciding how much I like this place.  The first time I went there, I thought it was really good, but the last few times it hasn't been that good.   It's a small place and really crowded at lunch."}
{"text":"Consistently the best breakfast place in the Cleveland Heights/South Euclid/Lyndhurst area. The potatoes ... whether hash browns or fries are phenomenal.  On the weekend get there early or you may have a wait. Small place inside and very bright interior with the tables close together.  If you want privacy not really the place to go since you will be side by side with your fellow diners.  But if it's a good breakfast or lunch you are looking for you will find it at Eat at Joes!"}
{"text":"Love this spot-classic greasy spoon place every neighborhood needs! The hash browns are the best! Be prepared to wait if you go at prime time on a weekend, and know that they only accept cash. Worth the trip to the ATM :)"}
{"text":"Came here at noon on a Thursday and it was packed! Only had to wait a few minutes for a table and we ordered within a few minutes. Tiny menu, but it's a small place and the prices can not be beat. Started with a muffin of the day, and then had eggs, bacon and hashbrowns. All was warm and tasty, but nothing extraordinary. The prices can't be beat though!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome breakfast spot. Quick, affordable and delicious!  We got omelettes, bacon, toast and hash browns (may be the best I've ever had). Nothing was greasy... the bacon was super crispy (YAS!).  I'm definitely heading back to Joe's in the future.  By the way, I think this place might be cash only, so watch out for that."}
{"text":"Love this place! Extra crispy hash browns, super fast service and prices you can't beat. One of my favorite breakfasts in town."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices! Just a \"regular Joe's\" type of diner. Wish there were more tables, but it's worth the wait (especially for the tuna melt)."}
{"text":"Small, quaint diner that has a loyal following of locals. I always get the basic breakfast meal - eggs, to die for hash browns, turkey sausage and toast. Food always promptly served hot, delicious and budget friendly. They get you in and out with prompt, friendly service. Cash only."}
{"text":"***CASH ONLY***Loved this place!!! I will definitely be back! The food  is so good, and definitely fresh. The service was good too. And boy were they busy! The people behind us were regulars and tried to get us a free meal by saying it was on Joe lol. I got the eggs Florentine with hash browns and my fiancé got the same with a side of oatmeal. It was absolutely delicious! We didn't know it was cash only but luckily I had cash on me. And it was worth it."}
{"text":"No frills, somewhat bright and cramped dining area, but damn good food.  Eat At Joes used to be even smaller and more cramped at their previous location (if you can believe it).   The service is fast and the food is fresh and basic. They make their own hollandaise sauce, so I always go for the Eggs Benedict. It's great! They also do a Florentine version. Hashbrowns have a nice crisp on them. Juices are fresh squeezed.  All this and economical too.  If you want a quick, great breakfast, hit up Joe's!"}
{"text":"The food is good! Four stars goes to the fast service and the quality and quantity of the food! A hidden gem! In my first review I said the food was decent until I went back several times, so I guess the food is much better than decent!"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Eat At Joe's is unpretentious and delivers what it implies; good cheap simple breakfast and lunch food.  Scrambled eggs done right. Great hasbrowns. Homemade-ish soup. A few specials everyday. 630 am to 2 pm . Cash only. And if you spend more than 8 bucks including tip on yourself ...eat less."}
{"text":"I eat breakfast or lunch here maybe 25 times a year and nothing changes--and that is GREAT!  Huge orders. Omelettes, pancakes, burgers, fries, home fries---all outstandingly tasty, served hot, and delicious.  Oh, and the coffee is good, and they serve Coke products which is a plus.  And there is more.  The daily specials are so good.  I especially love their chicken cutlets on a roll with veggies and fries or chips.  Finally, food-wise, the soups are outstanding--taste homemade.  All that and the people are great--such nice people.  Can't ask for more in my town, South Euclid, Ohio!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. I have had friends on social media bragging about this place and always had me drooling over the large portions and low prices. I finally was in the area and had to check them out. Tip: They are attached to the CVS and parking was crazy full as well as the line so get there early before the college kids wake up. (i mean that seriously) It was such an interesting mix of college kids (local colleges near), older crowd (seemed like regulars), and then what seemed like newcomers (me and mom) lol There was a line when we arrived and some lady leaving said \"That was like speed eating!\" Which we understood shortly. They went through the line quickly and were creative with seating. They broke up a big table into 3 2 tops which made for some intimate eating, I'm talking pass the ketchup, share the menu with the people next to you intimate. We didn't mind because everyone was nice. Staff was speedy fast and friendly. We noticed a high amount of take out orders too!  Bottom Line: THE FOOD, PRICES, AND PORTIONS WERE PHENOMENAL. That warranted caps, i promise. My dish was $4.50...you heard that right. For two eggs, hash browns, toast, and 2 breakfast sausages. Moms large three blueberry pancakes were $4.00. WHAT!!! The pancakes were delicious and they had fresh blueberries in them. We paid for both of us what we would have paid for one of us at a chain restaurant. They are cash only though so keep that in mind.   Didn't give it five cause it was a little cramped in there, the decor, seating, and utensils and such could use some upgrading. But its a cash only small diner like place and you get your moneys worth so is any of that other stuff important? lol The restaurant size definitely did turn away a lot of people though. We saw 2 large groups leave due to the line, they would definitely benefit from a larger spot that could seat everyone, specifically groups larger than 4....we will be back, probably to try out the turkey club that was massive and looked delicious for lunch!"}
{"text":"The expression in the restaurant biz amongst servers is \"Turn em and burn em\". That's what Joes does. No its not inside CVS, but next to and in the rear of the building. They do a huge volume and its cheap and clean but also cramped and rushed. French toast eggs, turkey sausage. Its simple quick breakfast good. Nothing glorious. Good coffee, great eggs benedict. I'm between three and four stars but the service was fast and no nonsense and clean. So I'll give it four."}
{"text":"LOVELOVE Eat at Joe's!! Prices are awesome, never spent more than $6. Their service is speedy taking into consideration the amount of people that come in and out. Food is fabulous, always hits the spot on Sunday mornings. Best diner around."}
{"text":"OUR FAVORITE BREAKFAST SPOT! My Fiancè and I come here almost once a week. We are such regulars that the staff know us by name. It is a CASH ONLY place, but it's completely affordable!! We just bring $20 with us when we go. It covers both meals AND and very generous tip. The portion sizes are huge.  I highly recommend this mom and pop Breakfast spot.   The \"down side\" about this hot spot is that it closes at 2pm and the inside could be a little more modern. That's about it."}
{"text":"Awesome cheap breakfast, brunch and lunch. This place is always packed and for good reason. This is a no frills establishment and with good reason. Just plain old good food, courteous wait staff and small menu of food they know how to do well. Bring cash though!"}
{"text":"great place. very casual, low cost, great portions and the food was delicious! the hash browns were my favorite. remember, it is cash only."}
{"text":"Let me first start out by saying that this place, for a divey mom & pop spot this place is hand down one of the most affordable places I've been to in a long time.  I mean $4.00 for a stack of pancakes and about $3 for eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast, you can't beat that.  Or can you? Maybe.  I need to explore more.  Anywho, this place is cramped so if you are a person who needs elbow room, think about going elsewhere for something to eat.  This place is only open for breakfast and lunch so dinner is out of the question.  Unless you enjoy dinner at 1PM.  I liked my food.  I got the two eggs scrambled with cheese, turkey sausage, hash browns, toast and cinnamon pancakes.  I recommend the cinnamon pancakes although be warned that the cinnamon part may be centralized and not cooked throughout the pancake.  My major issue with this place was that the turkey sausage and pork sausage look similar.  My husband and I both ordered sausage with our meals, I ordered turkey and he ordered pork.  Well, our waitress wasn't the one to bring us our food, another waitress did.  I asked her if she knew which sausage was which and she wasn't sure so she took my plate back.  The cooks then proceed to tell her to come back to the table and have my husband try both sausages because the turkey sausage was saltier than the pork so he would be able to decipher it.  WTH?  Really?  My grumpy pants slowly slid on.  Instead of just fixing the correct meat for my meal, the diner asked another customer (my husband) to try to fix their mistakes.  I told the girl that that was unacceptable and that I needed to be sure that I was getting turkey sausage.  At that time our waitress came over and observed what was going on and just stumbled all over herself with apologies.  I mean c'mon.  It's South Euclid people!  There is a population of Jewish people who live in the area who do not eat pork.  Shoot, forget Jewish, there are just people in general who have different dietary needs.  Why is it acceptable to this establishment to place the liability of their service upon another customer?  I'm just shaking my head.  My trust in the service at this place has lost them a potential repeat customer."}
{"text":"I'll comment on the weekend breakfast/brunch because that's what I've had -   Good: Eat at Joe's is utilitarian, has just a touch of charm, very efficient waitstaff, a diverse crowd (grumpy coot sits next to family with a toddler sits next to me), and a cheap, tasty breakfast (hash browns, 2 eggs, toast = $3.00).    Bad: Not much, although the wait is probably longer if your party has 3 or more people in it.  You'd miss it if you aren't looking. It's located next to the CVS."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. When we moved into the neighborhood we were told about this place. When we got there we were ignored and had to ask for someone to take our order. They came around only once for a refill. Food was average and they didn't accept cash."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall. Fast and friendly hard to find. But definitely worth try for breakfast"}
{"text":"Eat at Joes is a local hidden gem for us here in South Euclid. They only serve breakfast and lunch until mid afternoon, and the tables are small and cozy. You are bound to run into someone you know if you are a regular from the area. You can get a full breakfast plate for around 3 to 5 dollars including a cup of coffee. The same ladies have been waitressing there for many years and always come to work with big smiles on their faces. I have never had a bad meal at Eat at Joe's and will continue to dine there frequently."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast spot.  I rather go here than Bob Evans.  The hash browns are on point.  The prices are so much more reasonable than any other place.  If you need a place to go Eat At Joe's is definitely the move."}
{"text":"Cannot beat Joe's on price or service, from the time   You order to food is 5 minutes at most. The food itself also fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the area. Cheap prices, nothing fancy. Must pay cash. Limited space, so you may have to wait a little while to be seated on weekends."}
{"text":"Service was average, food was average and they don't take credit cards. Felt cramped and rushed, won't be back."}
{"text":"What a great diner. This is a classic family run greasy spoon. It reminds me of a similar diner when I was growing up. You won't get super fancy creations but you will get good hot food, prepared quickly and at great prices. They're open every day for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Eat @ Joe's knows what it is, and knows what it isn't. Take it or leave it. Cheap, delicious and consistent all-American breakfast and lunch favorites every day.  Amid an ever-growing scene of $30 gourmet brunches, it's nice to know there's still Eat @ Joe's. Note: seating can feel very crammed at certain tables, and they are closed most national holidays."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since the mid 90's. Eat at Joes was a great neighborhood diner, but over the years the place has fell off, not too mention the new waitresses this place is hiring are horrible and rude as hell. Menu is basic, prices are cheap, but this place is cash only so be sure to have cash. If you like to pay for rude and mediocre service then this place is right up you alley and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Eat at Joe's is probably the least expensive breakfast spot I can think of. Usually this results in trade-offs. Not here. This place screams of value.  A plate of two eggs, crispy hash browns, a side of breakfast meat, toast, english muffin or bagel is still under $4. Service is quick, friendly and attentive. You'll never see the bottom of your coffee mug here, which is a good thing.   Eat at Joe's is a no frills greasy spoon in every sense of the imagination. From the small dining room to the limited menu, this place serves an inexpensive meal quick and with better than average craft."}
{"text":"Food is good for the price, staff friendly. Only criticism is hand washing. I don't believe in bussing down a table and then serving someone's food to them  This means you touched the dirty dishes someone else used and then  going to serve me my food that just came up. I seen a server wipe something from her face and then continue on to serve food that is the only criticism. I've only seen that done once but still wash your hands before you get someone their plate. This is how people get colds, flus or any other kind of virus."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. They have an amazing & hardworking staff that strive to please the costumer. Best breakfast in CLE. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The first time we tried coming her we ended up driving by it and not turning around... WE really wish we had.. Came here Sunday for a late breakfast. The have a basic menu and they execute it very well. I had a ham and cheese omelette with hash browns. My wife had the egg special with bacon and a pancake. Food came quickly and tasted great. The price was great, we left spending 20 bucks including tip. WE will be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast for two with coffee for less than $20!! And that includes tip. Totally old school breakfast spot. Lots of locals who the servers seem to know by name. Great breakfast specials and pretty good coffee. If you're looking for a trendy place this is not it. But you want simple breakfast food for cheap...well here it is."}
{"text":"Honestly my fav breakfast joint I have found since moving to Cleveland.  Friendly staff. Great old diner feel.  Wonderful food. I will be here very often!!"}
{"text":"This is the epitome of a greasy spoon restaurant and it is delightful! We were back visiting my husbands family and he wanted a bit of nostalgia so we ate here for breakfast. Nothing sexy about this place but I wish we could have eaten here every morning of our trip!   I got the breakfast sandwich with a side of grits (on special that day) and my husband got an omelette with hash browns. Everything was so good and taste exactly like you imagine it should. Coffee was typical diner coffee. Would come back here, obviously."}
{"text":"Service is so fast and the prices are so good that I can see why it's cash only. Food is as good as Mom's... Except the grits, but it's Ohio :)"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday so it's expectedly busy but we only waited a few minutes for a table. Service was good, food was great! Cash only! ATM is available next door at CVS for $3 fee. I got the eggs with sausage patties, hashbrown, rye toast and grits. I also tasted their blueberry pancakes. All the food was on point!"}
{"text":"Decent greasy-spoon diner breakfast food,  spotty service.  Hours suck, sparse parking and the place is way too tiny.   We ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which came with toast, and eggs benedict. We also ordered a side of hashbrowns.  This breakfast was $20, was unremarkable, and is something I can make at home.  Portions are small for the price...the three egg omelette could not possibly have been made with three eggs (it was too small for that).  If you are passing by and want something basic, and there's not a line, stop in.  Otherwise, there are much better places (5th avenue, jack's deli, tommy's, the inn on Coventry).  This is like a more expensive Denny's."}
{"text":"My mom and I go here about once every other week for breakfast just to catch up and have girl time.  It's a tiny place, but it's always packed.  We've never had to wait for a table though because this place cranks out the service and food quickly.  Typically get the standard breakfast (eggs any style, bacon/sausage, toast and hash browns)).  From order to serve is about 10 minutes and it's always done right!!  Bill is usually about $13 for 2 people.  Great little greasy spoon."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Cheap! Cash only! Got the ham and cheese omelette with hash browns on the side. Plenty of food."}
{"text":"My husband  and  I Love this place. It's our weekend breakfast go to place. It's quaint small but very efficient  and the food is excellent  and they have you out of there in less time than you would probably  be  sitting in McDonald's drive thru  and taking it home and  eating it."}
{"text":"Good no frills spot. Reminds you of an old diner. They are open for breakfast hours but what they do, they do it well. All for a reasonable price. Bring cash as they dont accept plastic. The server was rushed but friendly. A small wait is required but other than that its a keeper."}
{"text":"Great breakfast & lunch place. Good portions,  fast friendly service. Prices are good too.  I really like the photos of old boxers that adorn the walls.  It's always a good meal at Eat at Joes!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for the simple diner. They're genuine. They're straightforward. They don't put on airs. I'm not sure it gets more simple and local than Eat at Joe's. This place isn't fancy. White walls. White plates. A few pictures of old boxers on the wall (people boxers, not underwear boxers). I sat down at the counter because the restaurant was at about 95% capacity. You know the food is good when a local diner is crammed. It immediately struck me how clean everything seemed. Another big positive. The middle aged gentleman behind the counter immediately greeted me with simple Cleveland friendliness. You know it if you're from there. It was like he was really glad I was there but he wasn't going to embarrass me by making a big deal about it. He got me a cup of the hottest, best diner coffee I've ever had. I only drink coffee 3-4 times a month, but I'd drink coffee every day -- EVERY DANG DAY -- if every cup of coffee was like that one. Oh my gosh. My waitress was friendly and pointed to the menu, a tiny plastic stand like the ones you see advertising drink specials on the table at chain restaurants. It had maybe a dozen breakfast items on one side and a similar number of lunch items on the other. There were also a couple specials on a board behind the cash register. I like that. Know what you can do and do it well. I got two eggs, a couple pieces of buttered rye toast, several strips of crispy bacon, and a generous portion of what might be the best hashbrowns I've ever had. They were really crisp on the outside, a beautiful golden color as well, and inside they were soft and potato-y. I mean, just... perfect. What a crunch, followed by those amazing potatoes! I scraped every last morsel off my plate. Staggeringly, the bill was like $6.25. Six dollars and twenty-five cents. Two best-ever items. Only in Cleveland. Good lord, I cannot wait to move home someday."}
{"text":"Small neighborhood place tucked away behind CVS. Lost a star because they are Cash Only and the bacon was not good."}
{"text":"It's simple, Eat at Joe's. This place is so dirt cheap for what it is, you really can't complain about anything else considering the quality of the food is actually pretty good. Packed on weekends, but I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes. Don't forget to bring cash."}
{"text":"I love eat at Joe's. I discovered this place in college and now whenever I am back in Cleveland I make it a point to have breakfast here. I have ordered the same thing everytime because it is Just that good.  Others might complain about the crowded space but I think it just adds to the ambiance.    Good food at awesome prices, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! Fresh and quick!  The most wonderful and yummy Eggs Benedict. for $5! Attentive service and delicious food- it does not get better then this! It's not fancy, it's fulfilling! You gotta try this place. Cash only and only open for breakfast and lunch. Everything is homemade and very inexpensive."}
{"text":"Opens early, great breakfast.  Fast service. Very friendly place. It was my first time there and it seemed like I was the only person that did not know everybody. I was made to feel welcome.  If I was in the area again I would make it a point to go back."}
{"text":"Love eating at Joe's.   Used to live in the neighborhood, and went there a few times a week.   Now I have to make it point to get over there, but love doing so.   The food is always quality, and they have good specials they rotate in and out of the daily menu.   Prices are extremely cheap compared to others.   Staff is wonderful, they get to know you and remember your ordering habits.  Service is quick.  Can't say enough about this spot!"}
{"text":"I felt like an outcast in this joint for the simple fact I am not 60+ years of age. I got a few stare-downs as if I were using the white restroom somewhere down South in the 50's. Maybe poor taste for an example, but as always I give it to you as I feel, this review is no different. This place is well disguised too, I drove around 2-3 times before realizing where it was. Its connected to the building where the drugstore on the corner stands. Walgreens/CVS, I don't remember.  Food was good and cheap though, just like I like it. I got eggs bene and was not disappointed one bit. My server was kind and attentive to my needs as well."}
{"text":"Great little diner tucked away on the side of the CVS. I had heard rave reviews for the hash browns, and they were on point. Perfectly crisp yet creamy. I get them every time. I have enjoyed every single thing I have ordered here. The servers are no-nonsense, the customers are regulars, and the food is delicious. And it's a frickin' steal."}
{"text":"My go-to breakfast place!  Typical diner food and service. But the staff has been there for years so that shows a well run restaurant. Good coffee!"}
{"text":"Easily the best dinner breakfast I've had anywhere. I got an omelet, hashbrowns, and toast for about $7.50. The omelet was massive, but fluffy and delicious. The hashbrowns were cooked to perfection. It's a small location so you may have a wait but it is more than worth it. This is also a cash only place so keep that in mind. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
