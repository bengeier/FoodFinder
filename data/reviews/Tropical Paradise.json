{"text":"Excellent petit Resto Trinidadien sans prétention mais proposant une cuisine haute en saveur. Nous avons dégusté leur cary de cabri et leur jerky au poulet servi avec salade, riz et bananes plantain: des vrai délices! Leur plats ont le bon goût de ceux faits maison. Service agréable."}
{"text":"We have tried going so many times but it never seems to be open.  We heard it's good but we have no clue. I highly recommend you call ahead to be sure your luck isn't as bad as ours."}
{"text":"Tropical Paradise has been open for a long time. I'm not sure exactly how long, but when I was a teenager I used to come her for 1$ delicious, melt-in-your mouth chickpea doubles. I went back recently and absolutely nothing has changed except that the doubles might now be 1.50$. I had a classic goat jerk and a chicken roti. What I remembered where the fried plantains, the layers of flavour in every bite and the friendly, fast service. It has not changed. Goat melting apart in your mouth, potatoes so perfectly cooked and the spices- the flavours!! My!! I can't wait to get back for another meal. 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken in town. A real nice Trini restaurant. I am yet to try other dishes as I always fall for the jerk."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty tasty!   When you're in the mood for something different, look no further!! I didn't know what a lot of the things on the menu were, but the helpful staff instructed me!  I had a goat \"double\" and a side of plantain, and hubby had the jerk chicken plate with salad and rice.  We shared a \"sorrel\" (drink).   Everything was delicious!!  Spicy, but not overpowering.  I understand why this place gets so many 5 star ratings! The ambiance is very very casual (order at the counter/pick it up when ready/clear your own table) but the food is worth it.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of those hidden jewels that everybody keeps a secret and orders from then claims they cooked it themselves. Its known that Caribbean folks are passionate about cooking  and have no problem when it comes to spicing their foods and its safe to say that the flavor boat has dropped anchor in this little gem   . this is a great place to go to try something new and different ... Note the hot sauce is house made and is Hot not hot like wow that's spicy but more like OMG My Mouth is on fire call 911 Hot. you 'll have to try their doubles witch is the Caribbean version of the burger . your pallet will thank you after dining here !"}
{"text":"First experience with Caribbean cuisine. I had the goat(or was it oxtail? Don't remember lol!) plate. PRETTY spicy but good. The staff is nice and the environment is calm."}
{"text":"My folks in CDN have been coming here for some time, and I can see why. Tropical Paradise is down-home, Trinidadian comfort cuisine at its finest. My go-to is the jerk chicken plate, which is amazing. Grilled slices of jerk seasoned chicken with just the right amount of kick, on top of rice with a side salad and plantains. But the underrated joints here are the doubles, which are a common street food in Trinidad and Tobago. They're basically a sandwich made with fried flat bread filled with curry channa (original) or with meat added (chicken, goat, beef, etc). Cheap, filling, and delicious. The folks who work here are super sweet, and if you decide to dine in, the food and the music will take you back to that Jamaican vacation you took a few years back. Just don't mind the snow outside the window :)"}
{"text":"The best Caribbean food in Montreal. Doubles? amazing. Roti? Amazing. Aloo pie? Amazing. Jerk plate? Amazing. Plantains? Amazing.   The family running it also amazing! The only sad thing is that I moved away from the city and find myself craving it WEEKLY. It's delicious. Whatever you pick you cannot be disappointed. Make sure to taste their delicious hot sauce as well on the side. Miss you tropical paradise!"}
{"text":"Excellent Trinidadian cuisine. Doubles are indeed a treat. Perfectly cooked chana masala between two puris. Chana masala is a chickpea simmered to a delectable state and infused with aromatic and flavourful Indo-Caribbean spices. Puris are fried flat breads made from chickpea flour dough. The combination is irresistible. Served with a sweet and sour tamarind chutney as well as a highly piquant scotch bonnet pepper sauce. This place also has excellent potato balls.   Ask for a tall, cool glass of authentic mauby. This is a refreshing root beverage akin to sarsaparilla or a lightly sweetened root beer. You might also want to try the sorrel which is a sweet and festive tonic of a beverage made from the sorrel flower and enhanced with ginger, lemon and various spices. A healthy portion of Caribbean rum is optional."}
{"text":"Food is great, gentleman owner at cash is great. Jerk chicken has awesome flavor and spice. Chicken stew is mild but very tasty. Vegetarian dishes of chickpeas, spinach and various other vegetables are super too. I usually get the combo plate that comes with your choice of two mains (I go either for jerk chicken + vegetarian dishes, or on days I don't want to do spice, chicken stew with vegetarian dish) plus tasty rice, some plantains and small green salad. We always do take out just because the ambiance isn't the greatest (but that's not why you should go!). Prices are cheap to fair considering the large portions. This is a family-run business, and it's really nice to see that they appreciate and respect their customers. I hope they stay there forever!"}
{"text":"After driving by this place daily for over a decade, we FINALLY decided to try it out. What on earth were we waiting for? The food was fabulous!  Pure comfort food with serious flavour. The doubles are incredible, the jerk chicken was amazing. Went in to get takeout and was out the door in about 10 minutes - that's fast, very friendly service!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Great curry goat, lots of meat and few bones. The jerk chicken is spicy and tender. The doubles are must, any flavor. Great bang for your buck!!"}
{"text":"Love the selection that they have here and the prices just can't be beat!!! The only thing you need to eat here is a double. Ask the staff about it. Look at my video. It's the best thing between two slices of carbs ever. Try the goat. You won't regret it!!! You can also have the original with chickpeas only. So delicious. I need to try other things here but my eyes always hone in on doubles. Yours should too!"}
{"text":"Tropical Paradise is soooooooooo satisfying!! my mouth is watering just talking about it! Their jerk chicken is flavourful and tender on top of their rice and salad. Their hot sauce is spicy and delicious. But the star of this little restaurant is the ox tail. Ohhh myyy goshhhhhh its sooooooo good literally like butter in your mouth, I don't even understand how the oxtail can be so fall off the bone tender! I would highly suggest Tropical Paradise!"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken in montreal! Even the rotis are pretty good. I tried the pineapple chicken once and it's not as good as the jerk. The spicy sauce is great too. The place doesn't have the best decor so it's not a good sit down place but the food will blow you away. Great find!  Update: I recently tried the oxtail - DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"roti is ok, ive had better. the music is too loud. i think id like to see metal cultery and real plates too, this cafeteria thing keeps sliding ariund as i struggle to use a plastic knife."}
{"text":"I took the jerk chicken with rice. It was good! The staff is friendly. If you are in the area give it a try"}
{"text":"The only Caribbean place i go to and trust. Friendly service and a lot of regulars. Jerk chicken is good and the only doubles in MTL so far that i love. Very good price. And the son is always coming with with new creative ideas. (Goat patties). Only place i know to have a jerk chicken roti.  Its a humble place with a good vibe and tasty Caribbean food and treats!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here for a long time and finally did. Looked at the menu and decided to get the regular size jerk roti and doubles. It came out to around $12. The guy at the counter was really nice and the service was fast. The jerk roti and doubles were both bless, good flavour, spice and pretty filling. I'll definitely come back for more soon."}
{"text":"Chicken fucking doubles...Hands down, without a doubt, no question, the greatest tasting thing on earth! If I was on death row, this would be my last meal and I would die with full stomach a smile on my face. Up until now, I had no idea that food could taste this great. My only complaint is that I get full from eating this incredible meal which prevents me from eating more.  Please, everyone reading this, do yourself a favor and get these chicken doubles today. Get some for you, your mom, your dad, your grandmother, your neighbours, everyone.  Just get some in your mouth ASAP."}
{"text":"I'm a trinni girl myself, and can cook what I think is some mean west Indian food, so I tend to get extra critical when I eat west Indian food made by other people.  When this place first opened years ago, I decided to give them a chance.  I can say with 100% honesty that it has been my go to place for Caribbean take out when I don't feel like cooking.     Their jerk chicken is amazing, their curry chicken is amazing, their doubles are HUGE, and they offer a nice selection of chick peas, chicken, shrimp and goat doubles, and they are DIRT CHEAP.  The food is seasoned perfectly.  It's family owned and the family are such nice people.  This is DEFINITELY a place to check out if you are in Montreal and want some good quality west Indian food.  The ambiance is rather bland, although they do have an out of place pool table in the back, but it's the food you're going for, and for the years I've been going there, it's always been consistent, and always been great."}
{"text":"Kind of an oddly placed gem, right on Decarie as it is. Never seems particularly busy when I've gone, but the food is really good, and the owners are pleasant."}
{"text":"Came here late at night during my last day in Montreal and got the regular oxtail because I grew up eating it. Not fall off the bone soft but was enjoyably tender and had good flavor. Would get it again ^V^"}
{"text":"Really good food and very welcoming, first time we went we ordered  chana roti, classic and goat doubles, aloo pie, red snaper and curry goat, everything was delicious !! today we got some more doubles (best doubles in MTL), oxtail, curry veggies and once again all very tasty and fresh. This place is becoming my go to spot !"}
