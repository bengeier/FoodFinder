{"text":"Another lunch spot near the office, it does the trick when I have a shawarma craving but I've had much better. 

Positives are that I see them charring the chicken early in the morning on my way in so I know they're not serving leftover meat from the day before. It is real meat and deliciously marinated. I also enjoy their garlic and hot sauces. The price point is more than fair as well at around $6 for a nice sized sandwich. 

Negatives are that the place doesn't seem the cleanest, I've heard some stories of rodents and I know they've had conditional passes before but so long as I see the green pass when I go in, it doesn't bother me too much. Also they don't press the sandwich enough at the end, they have a line everyday so I imagine they're trying to pump out as many meals as possible. As a result the sandwich is often cold by the time I eat it.

3* A-okay, does the trick."}
{"text":"Food poisoning due to cross contamination from bad food handling! I love Persian fast food! I went there yesterday,  February 3rd 2015, I purchased two Faffel sandwiches, one for lunch, and other for dinner. I ate one sandwich for lunch there,  then headed on my way to do some shopping at Eaton Centre by TTC. When I arrived at the mall, I had to dart to the washroom. I didn't think too much about it because my stomach stopped hurting immediately after that, but I left the mall and headed home. When I got home, within an hour,  (the sandwich is all vegetarian,  so there should be worries about the food going bad), I put the other sandwich in the fridge for later. Well,  when dinner time came,  I heated up half of the sandwich on a high heat in my microwave... Now,  since from last night 8pm and on going,  I have been living in my bathroom.  Although all the staff were wearing gloves during service, the cooks' gloved hands had already cross contaminated the vegetables with the uncooked chicken shawarma. When I left (after eating)  I noticed that the cooks never changed their gloves).  So, if anyone had a faffel sandwich for lunch yesterday,  might be suffering from food poisoning, just like me.  I will always be a lover of Persian food,  but I'm never eating there ever again."}
{"text":"Blech...

The food is about as tasty as the building is tasteful.

Seriously guys... Sales down 5%? Put up another sign that looks like it was made by someone studying to be a sign maker at clown college! That'll bring them in...

If the food was good, I would be ok with the signage, but it isn't. It's mediocre at best and the place is pretty gross. For such an A-list location to have such a D-list restaurant is tragic. 

You guys are spending money in the wrong places... Close for the weekend and clean the place and your process up. It's broken right now."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place! On top of being way overpriced for what you get, place is dirty and smells. I ordered beef kebob and for my $15, I got 5-6 tiny pieces of overcooked beef, some stale rice and a disgusting salad. Will not be coming back to this place ever."}
{"text":"Not sure where those other people went, but my experience was quite different.  My wife and I really enjoyed the different tastes.  We started off the first day with the chicken shawarma which was excellent, came back the next day for the koobideh, and the third day we had the koobideh again.  Yes, impatient people, you have to wait for the koobideh, but they cook it fresh.  The place is not dark and dingy.  The wait staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Nice decor and ambience, friendly staff, great view. The wrap is slightly bland, though, the chicken (although moist and tender) needs a little more zing. Also, no tabouleh."}
{"text":"Not bad food (not great either). Owner has shi* attitude, extremely rude (to someone else) and was even more rude over the phone. 

Wont visit again, i dont recommend anyone doing so either, just ruins your whole day when you deal with that guy."}
{"text":"the best middle eastern food I ever had . You must try it if you wanna taste the real middle eastern cusine. It makes the diiference when a chef cooks for you. AAAAA .pluses."}
{"text":"I'm currently sitting eating this dry Falafel plate and I was so disappointed I had to make a yelp to save my fellow falafel eaters. Each falafel is the size of a golf ball and has the consistency of a deep fried item who has been sitting there for awhile so it turns into a stale dry chewy outer core with a even a drier old meatloaf inner core. The falafels look over cooked and a weird dark brown colour. Falafel should be moist, soft and chewy but these just taste like grainy spiced balls who have been kept warm by a light. As a Middle Eastern restaurant I'm surprised the hummus doesn't taste good or fresh as it has this weird tang and watered down consistency. I paid $10 for 4 dry falafels some rice and barley enough toppings to call it a salad. To top it off the staff isn't attentive and doesn't acknowledge you when you walk in and the female worker looked lost and confused while I was asking her questions. Definitely not worth your money walk down the street (Queen Street) and pay the same amount for Me Va Me."}
{"text":"I don't know about shawarma there, but I am always eating falafel sandwiches there. They are one of the best in the city. I like friendly staff, their (sometimes arabic) music. After they started to run promotion (two sandwiches for $6) I even started to come there each third day. Wonderful add-on to a city's diet. 
I also love that they open late. 
Tip: ask for hot sauce and garlic sauce."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn between giving this place a 2.5 and a 3.

Pros
- close proximity to work
- friendly staff
- reasonable prices

Cons
- close proximity to work
- the food is alright

It's a clean, decent sized place with a view made for people watching but for some reason I feel like I'm being rushed when I eat there. 

Since I'm not a smoker the shisha option isn't a big sell for me either."}
{"text":"dark? dingy? what are these people talking about? My coworker literally just turned me on to this place and I went back the next day and the food was still fabulous. I had the chicken shawarma plate and it was filled to the brim just the way i like it - plenty of rice, salad and topped with enough sauces to keep me very happy. The people were not super duper friendly, but who cares? my food was prepared nicely, chicken tasted fresh, hot and juicy and my plate was packed high full of yummy goodness...this is what I came here for, not to chit chat. the only reason why i not giving it a 5 is because i cant help but to compare it with Ali Baba's, where I go to all the time...the lentil rice at Baba's is very savoury and addictive where as the rice here is ok, but not as savoury. Other than that, i will be splitting my time between both places now!"}
{"text":"Johnathan N's review is, as always, better-written than mine, and he beat me to it.  The food is perfectly acceptable for cheap schwarma, but the vibe is rundown place for drunks, with nice but not-clued-in counter staff.

It's okay though.  I'd hit Pamier Kabob over this place for sure, and haven't ventured further for this type of thing, but it's okay."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for their chicken shawarma plate. And would have given it a 4 of 5 star rating before. The last two times i went changed that... i found not one but multiple hairs mixed in with the rice. I stopped going there for a few months but decided one night after a late shift to grab a plate from there since it was convenient. 
Unfortunately i found hair in the rice again. I actually had to unravel it from around my tongue ring. Do you know how disgusting that is? 
I know it was not my hair because mine was so long it went down to my belly button and the hairs i found would have only reached up to my chin at a maximum length. 
All they'd need to do is wear a hairnet while cooking the rice and serving the food.
Please, please start wearing hair nets when cooking the rice! 
I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Both times I went right after clubbing.  The place wasn't amazingly busy around 3am like most after hour restos, which was good, because I was able to get my food right away.  The seating area is pretty good, really no complaints. 

The first time I went i had the chicken Shawarma sandwich, and it was so amazing! I don't know what it was, but it was hella good! the portion could have been bigger, because I was actually still pretty hungry after. The price was a LITTLE expensive for a sandwich, but I guess at 3am in the morning it doesn't really matter.

The second time I went I had the chicken Shawarma plate. Obviously to avoid what happen the first time. I wasn't so impressed, the chicken itself was good, but all the add ons were just meeh. The salad was stale, and it wasn't the typical rice you usually get.  It was extremely filling, but I wasn't so impressed the second time around.

Other then that, Nora Shawarma was pretty good, fast service, good food, and a more quite environment.  If you can travel, along queen street they have Ali Baba's which has a lot more selection."}
{"text":"I went here Saturday for dinner, really craving a chicken shawarma...  I should have taken the hint when there was only one customer sitting besides me.  
The Good- friendly service

Otherwise- the meal came to $1.50 more than was advertised on the wall menu--- as the wall menu is for lunch only~ not told this when I ordered and the \"Lunch Specials Until 5pm\" sign is not clear that the specials are the advertised prices.
The Shawarma meal left much to be desired~ greasy chunks of chicken on wilted salade with what looks like Kraft Italian dressing.

I should have went to LouLous or Quick Pita...  Now I know:)"}
{"text":"Im iffy about this place. I like falafel pitas and tend to stay away from shwarma based pita sandwiches or any other dishes in general.

Its not bad but not the best either. Its cheap for downtown especially if you catch one of the daily specials. The staff is friendly and straightforward. If youre arabic though dont let them know that because theyll become overly friendly and start to \"take face\" as we would say in our native tongue.

Ive eaten there numerous times and havent had any problems really. I always walk out feeling full and with a happy stomach.

My only real concern is the freshness of the toppings and food during late night hours especially on weekends. I walked in once and was about to order a sandwich until i realized that the red pickles were extremely stale looking and borderline white and not vibrant purple/pink like theyre supposed to be. I mentioned that to one of the servers and he dismissed my concern stating they were \"fresh\". Ye my ass they were. You cant fool me bruv, ive been eating falafels since the day I was born some 25 years ago. It takes an arab to know when an arab is lieing!

Will visit again next time im craving falafel lol. Those red pickles better be red doe!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have higher reviews... The shawarma plate here is so delicious. The salad is just tomato, cucumber, and lettuce, but I don't mind. I'm not a huge fan of tabbouleh or pickled veggies like they have at other places."}
{"text":"This place serves a mix of Persian and Arabic dishes. The food quality and prices are decent. They also serve  shisha (hookah) and you can either smoke it inside or outside. Overall this is a good place for a quick lunch or smoking shisha."}
{"text":"The new management has changed a lot. Ive been going to this place for more than 9 months now and the new owner is changing the entire perceptive of Middle Eastern cuisine in Toronto, hes taking it to the next level
9 months ago, ambiance was dead silent, A4 sticky menus, tables werent always clean and there were only 2 employees.
Now, Arabic music in the background, electronic menus on the wall, tables are always shining, more than 7 employees, uniforms of black polo shirts for all employees and the service is amazing.
And dont get me started on the food. I as an Arab who has lived in Saudi Arabia for 9 years, (The mother of Arabic food) guarantee that if Nora opens in Saudi it will crush the market there. Hands down, the best Chicken Shawarma. The Garlic, hot and Tahini sauce al together make this amazing taste. The tenderness of the chicken.
The shawarma gets a bit messy because of the extreme juiciness, but I just love it.
Pricewise, I ordered a Shawarma an hour ago and it cost me 5.99.
Simply amazing"}
{"text":"i usually do my research before trying restaurants but this was close and convenient so I tried it. Wasn't a fan"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was a coincidence, but I got a bad case of stomach sickness after eating here, and my son also felt ill for a couple of days. I'm debating whether to report them for food poisoning. The falafel sandwich wasn't even warm, and the lentil soup was inedible. We'll never go here again."}
{"text":"Ok, I have to admit, I feel like I've become a bit too obsessed with this joint lately. I can't get enough of their Shawarma plate. I could leave the salad behind as it doesn't do much for me but the Shawarma is so incredible. I would also highly recommend the falafal. 

Another guilty pleasure about this place? They put out the burnt rice that is left when they are finished cooking the rice to eat and I love it so much. May sound gross... save judgment for when you try it!

The staff are also so incredibly friendly that I always have a great experience when I go into this joint. 

The prices are good and the food is incredible. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Sometimes at work I go here for a cheap lunch.

That is the beginning and end of my relationship with this establishment."}
{"text":"Came here after a movie for a mid day snack... I wasn't expecting much, so I wasn't too let down by the fact that this was yet another painfully average shawarma place...

I'm not saying this is a BAD place. It's definitely the best out of the few that I've tried so far in the city... But I just can't wait to actually find a shawarma place in this city that goes out of their way to impress people with good, quality ingredients and a CLEAN building to serve it in...

As far as the prices go, they're actually pretty decent (I paid $7 for a chicken shawarma), and they have some pretty decent deals. 

The ingredients are very fresh, so no complaints there... it's just that I had to specifically request garlic sauce for it and they ended up using tzatziki in its place, which just baffled me... (Sha-Gyro-Ma?!)

The highlight was when I turned to our server and asked, \"NO parsley?!\", and then watched 2 other people say the same thing after they came in to order, and we had sat down to eat... Seriously, get some parsley..

Again, not a terrible place if you just need something to fill the hunger gap on the cheap... However, my personal search for a decent Shawarma continues..."}
{"text":"Decent Shawarma, very friendly staff and open late. Close to UofT.
I tried their Shawarma, very fresh and high quality."}
{"text":"Incredibly mixed feelings about this place. 

The decor, staff, the general feel is very dirty and broken down. But once the food lands on your table...it's incredibly good. Specifically the kabab plate. The rice was flavourful and just right, the kabobs moist and melt in your mouth and the sauces on top just made the whole dish pop. 

Go for the kababs if you can ignore how broken down this place feels. It will be worth it."}
{"text":"not bad but not good either. 
I like parsleys, so I don't complain about it. And It's at a good price. I was actually amazed this place got such a low mark. Why do you ever want to order burgers or fries in a shawarma store?"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for shawarmas; so you can imagine how happy I was when I found this place at a convenient distance from my work.  Besides, relative to the marked up restaurants on Queen St, the prices aren't surprising - or that bad.  The food is okay, nothing to write home about.

Other than the food, something I would like to address is my utter dismay at one of the staff members' [uncomfortable] behaviour towards me.  
On Monday, during my second visit, I ran into a worker who served me two weeks earlier.  We chit chatted for a bit while waiting for my order.  He honestly seemed like a chill guy, up until the point where he asked my for my phone number.  When I deflected, he prompted me for my email...  then my facebook..  then \"any way I can contact you.\"  I told him that my facebook and email were strictly for friends and family.  To which he replied to, \"but I am your friend!\"  
\"What are you talking about?  I've only met you once.\"  I corrected.
Regardless of what his intentions were, under most circumstances should it not be acceptable to directly ask a customer for their contact information for personal use, it was really weird.  (Or at least a customer who has only dropped by twice!)  

I don't appreciate being asked for personal info from strangers; particularly when I'm hungry and just want my food.

Was looking forward to coming here during breaks for a quick meal, but that's out of the question.  (-1 star for the awkward exchange.)"}
{"text":"Heavens no, don't.

Well, mostly.

This is a 1-star joint. Dingy. Lots of staff, but they're stepping on each other's toes. No one really seems to know what they're doing. The cashiers don't know the menu, the prep staff have no system. The prices are just-okay.

I expected a wait for the beef koobideh since they would have to make it fresh (which, to their credit, they did), but I think I was standing in their takeout line for a good 15-20 minutes after the order was placed, which seems excessive.

As I say, a 1-star joint.

Except...

Damnit...

The food was perfectly fine once I got it. The koobideh was fresh, not overdone, and had some nice seasoning (or else the rest of the sandwich did). The ingredients were fresh and, unlike some of my esteemed co-yelpers here, I think the pickles are a solid addition. The right portion size for lunch, too.

In a clean place, with a competent staff and an efficient turnaround, they could ride my Koobideh pita to being a 3-star lunch place. As it is, the most that pita could do was save it from utter rejection. You can still do much better in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"Bland, boring, and inexplicably frequented by people who don't care about either blandness or boredom. It's overpriced too. You get a better deal walking to Peter for Ali Baba's or better flavour a block south at Pamier."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for two chicken shawarmas last Friday and they were....awwwful.  I don't think I've ever met a shawarma and didn't like and we were hungry!!  Yet, Nora managed to disappoint somehow.  The chicken tasted off.  My wife is convinced she got chicken liver and some by-product. I had way too much garlic sauce which made my pita all soggy.  Besides the price, not much else was right with these two chicken shawarmas!"}
{"text":"Visited again last night, and it really wasn't what I remember it to be. No curried onions anymore, and just wasn't very good at all."}
{"text":"I am writing this sick to my stomach, so this will be an angry message. There were two people ordering including myself and I told them about a food allergy I have. I ordered a falafel and was given a beef sandwich (the other persons, who got mine) covered in dairy. I had to cancel a class tonight to stay in because I am so ill. I will never come back here! This is the worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Under the new management, things are much better.  The food quality has improved somewhat.  The chicken is quite decent.... nice sauces....

Only prob is the food feels rather greasy and heavy.  You want to go here if you don't mind 'heavy' tasting food.  Perhaps at 2am on the weekend, a wrap from here is just the right ticket.

Prices are very good.  The stew specials with rice are very cost effective @$6.  The wraps are also well priced at $6."}
{"text":"Nora serves up a pretty good chicken shawarma. They aren't exactly the most consistent but still a decent option if you want a filling, inexpensive meal!"}
{"text":"Considering the competition, this place needs help.

The food is poor quality and portions are small compared to other middle eastern competitors. A short walk around the corner to Ali Baba at Richmond and Peter provides a far better portion and better quality middle eastern food. 

The restaurant is also very dumpy/trashy, which makes me wonder about the food and kitchen it comes from."}
{"text":"I didn't know shawarma could be this bad. 

Sad ingredients, weird spicing, whole leaves of parsley throughout, hamburger-like in its soft blandness. The pickled turnip wasn't pickled nor cooked nor raw.

It gets an extra star for being so cheap--$8.99 for two chicken shawarma sandwiches."}
{"text":"The shawarma at this place is great. But just the meat. the sandwich and the plate both come with salad that has this way-too-tangy zesty italian dressing on it that i don't care for. But, the meat makes the sandwich. I work nearby, and this is a pretty typical lunch stop for me. I can say the consistency is pretty good.

The thing that makes the meat so good is how they make it crispy. I love when the meat has a bit of charred crispy exterior. some of the best shawarma i've had has that quality. and the meat here is always fresh. they have a constant influx of customers.

i've never tried the other stuff they've got there but some of it looks pretty good. i'll have to try the kebobs one of these days. But I don't know.. i'm kind of a regular order kind of guy."}
{"text":"Checked out one of the reviews... \"Nice decor and ambience, great view\" - man, wow!!! Like, honestly - this place is an authentic rathole. Dark and filthy, you'll feel like washing your hands after touching the door handle. And it sits on the corner of Spadina and Richmond - if you can possibly find any \"view\" from out there, it might be your inner eye or something! Oh yes, there is some Mediterranean stuff inside - think shisha kits and Persian rugs - but otherwise...

Dudes who work there are friendly, and that's genuine - they will actually recognize you and cheer when you pass by and catch them chilling outside. They are probably the best thing this place has.

Food is of lunch quality, and I actually do grab their shawarma plate for lunch at least once a month for the past couple of years. Never regret - it's as good as any other lunch food around the block. Price corresponds to the food quality, so no problem there, too.

Resuming: Yes, you can get a ten-bucks lunch there, and it will be ok to eat."}
{"text":"Hot garbage. 

I used to be a fan but since 2011 things have been changing and it's been all bad stuff. Final straw today when my falafel sandwiches were tiny, thin, and terrible and my side of potatoes was dried out and tasted like cardboard. Compounding this terrible food was a completely baffling interaction when trying to pay. At first I was told they only accepted paypal, no debit or credit cards. 

Game over Nora."}

- chicken shawarma wrap = really delicious, but a bit different from all the shawarmas i've had before...namely they add this weird onion salsa that had celery in it, and hot sauce

- restaurant = dark and dingy, it's really meant for takeout 

i'd come back"}
{"text":"Not impressed, won't be back. 

This City has some fantastic shawarma spots but this isn't one of them. My shawarma plate was bland; no hummus, just rice, chicken and shredded lettuce.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and chewy. My wife had the lamb kabab which was better, but still not great. 

Also, this place could use a deep cleaning. The stuff behind the counter looked fine but the dining area needs attention."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is awesome! It's steps from most offices in Toronto. Service is great and they serve a healthy portion. I eat half at lunch and save the other half for dinner. I love the hummus and hot sauce. I'll remember to take a picture of it next time (as I usually devour it before I have time to reach for my phone)."}

Apparently the guy is new there.. but he sure knows how to talk to the ladies.. the cashier lady was even very nice.. he kept saying he wanted to take me home or I take him home (extremely flirtatious) but I'm a Gemini.. I can play that game too hehe. I got the beef and chicken and red chicken kabob, yes all 3 lolol ONLY because he up sold my a$s.. ah well, I was hungry and I really like the rice and the garlic and hot sauce.  Very tasty. My favorite part was the falafel! I love it at any middle eastern restaurant.. it's just so tasty, but this one was very flavorful I'd definitely come here for that again.. everything else was decent at best. I wouldn't say I recommend, as I usually do.. it was decent so try it for yourself to believe it.. I wouldn't come out of my way to come here though.. there definitely is better restaurants out there but they aren't bad. If you come here, try the falafel at least and the garlic sauce! Yum."}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma today.  A family member recommended this place after I asked about putting potatoes/fries in shawarmas - that's how I popped into this joint.
The man behind the counter was friendly.  I told him what I wanted and he said he could definitely put in potatoes. Great customer service, I'll give him that.
The actual product itself was good. It had the makings of a decent shawarma, but the potatoes could have been better. It seemed as if they were chunks rather than long frites. But I asked for it so I don't mind. I was happy with all the toppings they had - usually at other places it's just a bunch of lettuce and green stuff.  I like that they have pickled radish (tickles my taste buds).
Price was not too cheap and not too expensive and it's a good sized portion for a meal. Overall for $6.5 it's adequately priced. CASH only.
Definitely would stop by here again if I'm in the area, though I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Dreadful!!!   I almost never give 1 star ratings to anything, but this might be the worst middle eastern food I've ever had the misfortune of eating.

I feel bad writing this review because the people who work here are awesome friendly people.   I wish I didn't have to give this place such a bad rating.

The restaurant itself is a tad dirty looking.  Normally, holes in the wall are dirty looking but it's part of their charm.  Seeing a huge place like this so dirty is just really nasty.  The big space kind of amplifies the filthy look.

Food ratings:

Lamb Kabob: A-
Beautifully flavored.  Meat well cooked and soft.  Unfortunately, it was the only good thing on the menu.

Koobideh Kabob: C-
This is a steak kabob.  Beautifully flavored, but the meat was so damned tough that it was impossible to eat.  I ended up sucking the spices and juices off the kabob pieces for a few minutes and then throwing the meat away.  That's how tough the meat was.  Can you believe it?

Falafel Sandwich: D
One of the worst falafels I've ever had.  The vegetables were wilted, there was almost no tahini sauce, and the falafels tasted stale.  I ended up throwing my sandwich away.  You should know that falafel sandwiches are some of my favorite sandwiches in the world.  I was so sad!

Baklava: C+
Dry.  A tad stale.  Not sweet enough.  It really could've used more honey."}
