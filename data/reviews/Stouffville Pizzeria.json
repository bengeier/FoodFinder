{"text":"If you can believe it, Stouffville has almost every pizza chain that you could name. Don't forget, while it is expanding, the town really only has 34,000 or so residents, so to me, it's either overkill and someone is going to have close down because lack of business, or, jeez, the residents of Stouffville really love their pizza! Anyhow to elaborate, there is Boston Pizza, Pizza Pizza, 2-4-1, Domino's, Pizza Nova, and a new Pizzaville. (ok, I guess there is no Pizza Hut).  In addition there are a few independent pizzarias as well. One of which is Stouffville Pizzeria. Located west of 10th line, it sits in a small plaza. Not anything to look at, or be in from what I understand but I don't care because the pizza is good and I get delivery!  A large pizza with 4 toppings is $17.00 and delivery is $1.50. Not bad, I think. The large is a fair size as well. I'd guess that it's definitely bigger than a Pizza Pizza large.  So what is it specifically that I like? Well I like that they do a good job at spreading a good amount of toppings onto the pizza. I've really had no issue with respect to grabbing a slice out of the box only to find my piece to have one sad little pepperoni on it. On the contrary, I find that the toppings are in abundance (not loaded on however) and cover the entire pizza.  Yum!  To be fair, while the pizza is good, the choices are pretty basic with respect to toppings. So don't expect a white sauce or chicken or roasted red peppers. I'm not sure if you can get whole wheat crust either. Anyhow, the point is, if you are looking for a good pizza and you aren't fussy about fancy-pancy toppings then this is a good go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"We love Stouffville Pizza. We've lived in the Ville for many years. Stouffville Pizza is our \"Go To\" Pizza place. We've turned on friends and family to their Pizza and everyone loves their pizzas."}
{"text":"Decent place for pizza. They have your basic toppings.  You should order a head of time for your pizza if you plan to do pick up. Their time  estimation is spot on."}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza joint. Better than any franchise! No-nonsense is right; they don't need a bunch of extra instructions to make the best pizza. Generous with all their toppings."}
{"text":"No nonsense place, counter ovens and cash (no debit or credit cards). Quality was good, crust was soft on the inside and crisp on the outside.  No fancy toppings which is fine, but generous helpings. Easy and convenient kinda pick and take home style. Will go back again."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 mediums, which were quite large in fact. The fist pizza was a Hawaiian. There was very little pineapple and the ham didn't have any flavour. The second pizza we ordered we said we wanted it as spicy as possible. Yeah. Okay. The banana peppers weren't spicy at all. My mother could eat them and she HATES spicy food. The sausage was bland and didn't have any flavour, neither did the red peppers. There was a lot of cheese, but again, not much flavour and the sauce left a lot to be desired.   They don't have any extras like wings, and certainly no unique toppings.   The only redeeming qualities: the size and decent crust.  We won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Decent place for take-out pizzas; it looks like a family run pizza joint. Pizzas are better than the ones from other franchise places in town.  It's a tiny little place, cash only. I like how the prices include taxes already so you don't have to do the extra math."}
