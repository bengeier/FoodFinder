{"text":"This is probably one of the best restaurants in all of Toronto. Do what we did and you won't regret it. We didn't want to pick from the menu instead told them to pick for us including the wine. We were 6 people.  It was out of this world! L'Unita has some crazy talent in the front and in the kitchen. Their manager and sommelier, Rob is one talented son of a bitch. He chose some amazing dishes and perfect wine to pair and kept it all reasonable without gouging!  If you haven't tried L'Unita then you have missed out on some amazing food porn!"}
{"text":"What a warm, cozy, and romantic restaurant - just north of Yorkville. We were tucked away on a side table for two, away from the rest of the diners. The place was packed, and yet the servers still took their time to walk us through the menu and special dishes of the day. We started with an order of warm olives, roasted garlic, peperoncino, and citrus and followed that up with arancini di zucca - basically fried risotto balls on a bed of black truffle honey... YUM. I had the (handmade, in house) sunchoke and ricotta tortelloni as my main course, and we treated ourselves to a mascarpone and almond layered cake for dessert - topped with chocolate ganache and plated with thin slices of blood orange. Quality of service and quality of food were both top notch :)"}
{"text":"Ate here a second time on a second visit to Toronto.  Uneven, but nothing is bad; some things are excellent. The rocket and cucumber salad was ok -- it was a huge bowl of almost tasteless rocket, some cucumber slices and a light dressing. The grilled lamb was good, served with a delicious braised artichoke heart and some seasoned mashed potatoes. The cannolli was extraordinary: light, crispy, not greasy at all, with a delicious orange and white chocolate mascarpone filling. They make a lovely old fashioned and good coffee. The first time I went, back in February, it was very busy and the service was fast and efficient. This time, it was completely empty and the service was slow. Not sure what's going on there. Pricey compared to US midwestern city prices (Chicago), but that seems to be true throughout Toronto."}
{"text":"We frequently dine here. We have NEVER had a bad meal!!! The food and wine has always been superb!!! And the quality of service has always been spot on. I would highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto and seeing the sites.  After walking all around the city we happened here (not our first choice-that was booked, but the waiter there recommended L'Unita).   The menu is small here but the food was decent.  Didn't knock my socks off and with the prices it should have. Giving 2 stars because the service was lackluster.  Waiter was borderline rude which rubs me the wrong way, especially when hungry."}
{"text":"Their cannolis are the best in the world. Very knowledgeable staff especially regarding wine. Super cozy neighbourhood restaurant. One of my favourite bars to sit and enjoy a meal in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Slightly disappointed that they've taken the Berkshire pork chop off the menu, but they've promised it back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Went out with my family who were in town, made a reservation just to be safe and were glad we did since about 30 minutes after we arrived it got very crowded, for good reason! The atmosphere is warm and inviting, the staff is wonderfully friendly, the waiter was extremely helpful with recommending wine and food, and was friendly enough to have a pleasant chat with my dad who talks far too much! And the food is absolutely amazing.  Definitely recommend both the pizza and the short ribs, the pizza is cooked to perfection and made with super fresh ingredients, and the short rib is melt in your mouth good. Also, house made bread and olive oil that I swear they must press in the kitchen made the meal spectacular. Will definitely be returning the next chance I get!"}
{"text":"L'unita was dead upon arrival.  Fortunately, we had reservations so we were ensured the worst table in the house: one of maybe three or four tables for two, tucked away in a skinny side hallway.  Awkward.  Dark.  Romantic (but not at the same time).  We sat at the bar instead, but were told we had to be out for the next reservation.  First mistake.    The overpriced wine list was the second mistake.  The third mistake was the cold and distant service at the bar.   We asked for recommendations, she essentially said, \"everything is good, it depends on what you feel like\".  Well, duh.  We asked for the daily specials, she didn't offer them to us.  We finished our entrees; she took roughly 10 minutes to clear our plates.  All unacceptable.  Ordering the Truffled Arancini made with mozzarella & fresh yogurt was not a mistake.  It was very tasty, and the herb yogurt was thick, rich and refreshing.  The dish could have been a bit hotter, and now that I think of it, the mozzarella was nowhere to be found.  Either was, it was really delicious.  Fourth mistake: following the Arancini with the 'recommended' Truffled Beet Carpaccio with pistachio, soft poached egg & ricotta salata.  This was gross.  The presentation, the smell, the taste. . . all gross.  And the funny part is that I love all of the listed ingredients, I suppose just not together in this way.  The 'truffled' part is still a mystery to me - maybe there was a cheap drizzle of some truffle oil?  Overall, the dish fell flat.  A citrusy vinaigrette or a sharper cheese could have helped brighten it up.  For $14, this should have been better.  In case our server is interested (and is reading this review), the food from here on in was really delicious!  Thanks for (not) asking!  My vegetarian friend had the Margherita D.O.P. pizza and I had the Venison Ragu Gnocchi.  Both dishes were solid - not outstanding - but tasty.  The pizza's crust was a bit thicker than a Terroni/Libretto pizza, but really delicious.  The venison ragu had tender meat and the sauce had a nice hint of heat.  The gnocchi were a tad gluey for my liking, but were still good.  For dessert, we shared the Banana Bomboloni.  These were YUMMY.  You should GET THEM.  I suppose we got lucky, in that, what started terrible did end up being salvaged, but I have to say - I'd never recommend going back here again, and this experience makes me a bit apprehensive to try Malena."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, I've only been here for last call with an old friend who used to live upstairs, but it was always great. It's an Italian bistro in the Ave & Dav neighborhood. Not as upscale as say Sotto Sotto, but not some cheap joint either. The staff are all great guys and there's a distinctive neighborhood feel. They only open 5pm onwards, and have a real cozy bar area where you can have a scotch with friends or eat on your own and chat with the bartender."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to L'Unita for a couple of years now and have always loved it. Last Tuesday we took a couple of new friends there intending to impress them.  We had the most disappointing evening and are now debating whether we will ever go back again.  We started with the charcuterie sharing board which has always been great in the past.  This time, it looked as if the offering had been thrown together.  The actual plate was much smaller than in the past and seemed to consist of 1 small piece of cheese (usually about 4 different kinds in the past), 1 piece of prosciutto (usually 4 different interesting cold cuts in the past) and a bunch of indifferent vegetables.  Main courses were good.  We insisted that our guests have the cannoli for dessert - indicating that it was the best in the city, and even better than we had had on various visits to Sicily, its place of origin.  We were embarrassed by what we received that night.  We were informed that the chef was new.  Please, please get the old chef back - although as I said we may never know as it will no longer be our go to neighbourhood restaurant.   As an aside, even though it was 1/2 price Tuesday for wine, the resulting bill was quite expensive for such a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, wine menu and food! One of the best Italian spots in the city!"}
{"text":"GREAT FREAKING FOOD!   The atmosphere was calm and the servers were very knowledgable about wine. Overall a very pleasant experience.  Would highly recommend the short ribs. The chocolate cake with poached pairs were just a perfect end to a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"I love this place. Hate the two seating timezone thing but I guess it is good for their cash flow."}
{"text":"4/5! Great choice for summerlicious! For starters I recommend the Bufala Mozzarella Bruschetta over the lollo rosso & zucchini. For your main, I recommend the ciriole lamb bolognese! The pasta is fresh and the lamb is extremely flavourful.The grilled branzino is a good choice for those who prefer fish. The dessert is okay. I have definitely had better cannolis. Overall, great ambiance (fantastic option for date night) and friendly service. the only downside is getting reservations- you need to book well in advance if you want a Friday night at this place."}
{"text":"Highly recommend L'Unita for anyone that wants an amazing dining experience. From the minute you arrive to the minute you leave, the service, food, ambiance and everything is short of outstanding. It's rare to find a place in the city that go above and beyond the typical Toronto \"dining experience\" and make you feel special. The food is nothing short of amazing and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Italian dinning experience. Quiet and intimate ambiance, fantastic service. Can't say enough about this place and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for pasta, and might as well be my favourite restaurant in Toronto! Foods are sumptuous and well cooked. Pastas are better than any others I tried in Toronto as they taste authentic and delicious. Other dishes like fishes, meat, steak and pizza are strongly recommended too. They are always well prepared and taste fantastic. Another reason I love this restaurant is the romantic setting. It could be the most romantic place to dine in Toronto."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto! I love their charcuterie plate (the small plate has large portions and can even be shared between 4 people). Everything we are was delicious and the wine list is fantastic. The service was also amazing. I can't say enough good things about this place. Wine is pricey (cheapest bottles are in the $50-60 range), but I believe on Tuesday's bottles are half off."}
{"text":"I've been to L'unita twice..first time was excellent but the second time (a few nights ago) was one of the most memorable meals I've had in Toronto. I love the decor and lighting (plain bulbs above the tables and brick walls) too. I'm tired of expensive restaurants that deliver an average meal...and have been turned off pricey places for a while...but I went with my parents to L'unita for my dad's birthday and i have to say it was well, well worth the cost. It also delivers a unique menu- every dish has something different and unexpected paired with the main ingredient.  I started with the wood mushrooms appetizer-- clearly baked in butter --but don't fight it... SO delicious. it took me about 30 minutes to get through the whole thing because it was SO rich. so, so, so good though. we also had the fried artichokes (lightly battered- so good) and the raw fish special which was tuna with an amazing cranberry sauce. for my main, i had the grilled octopus salad done perfectly. I've also had the poached egg, pistachio and beet carpaccio salad which is pretty wild with its flavours but delicious and filling.  Also got the black kale and lentil sidedish ..oh myyyyy it was the best thing ever. with pecorino (as i recall- could have been parmesan?) melted on top.   for dessert had what was advertised as a dark chocolate cake.. expected a sort of flour-less feel but was more of a chocolate mousse (not my favourite sweet but still good for what it was). and they also brought us a cannoli for my dad's birthday which was fantastic with a hint of orange.   They were really great with our wines- we each had a different glass picked out for us by our waiter, although some were pricey (up to $16 a glass yikes).   what was really nice was at the end of our meal- after we'd paid- we were served celebratory complimentary prosecco.   Great night, great service and AMAZING food. for those rare special occasions, i would recommend l'unitas."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night and it was quite busy and fairly loud. The ambience is quaint with vintage lighting over table tops and the exposed brick wall gave it a urban feel. We were seated next to a large group so we had to raise our voices in order to hear each other.  The wait staff asked us three times if we've been helped which gave me the impression there wasn't an assigned person for our table and it seemed a bit disorderly.   Once the wine was delivered everything went smoothly after that. The appetizer consisted of a variety of cured meats with pickled vegetables and stuffed zucchini with chorizo. It was the smaller portion and it was enough for two.   My main course consisted of grilled branzino which was grilled to perfection! It melted in your mouth and was light and not greasy. I was very impressed.  My dinner partner had the short ribs and although it was a heavier dish I must say that the pork was tender and not too salty.    For desert the cannoli were yummy. The after hours crowd bag hung around at the bar were neighbourouhood locals and unfortunately polluted the place with cigar smoke. I am not against the scent of a good stogie but it was a bit much.   I would return but I'm not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great overall experience. Greeted by very friendly staff  Ceasar salad was great - just as you'd expect. The pizza we had was the spicy sausage and really well done. Also had the spaghetti pomodoro with ricotta - GREAT sauce and dish.   Ambiance -4.5 Service -5 Food - 5 Price to Value 5  Definitely recommend. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"We've been here numerous times and it's always been fabulous. We always get the server to pick some delicious stuff for us and eat based on their reccomendations (believe me it's the best way to do it!!!!). The food is always excellent, top notch ingredients and quality. If you go you must try... - the pork chop: to die for with sautéed leeks and cauliflower - the braised cauliflower: kind of like buffalo cauliflower you see most places but not fried!!  - the asparagus and prosciutto pizza: I think this may be seasonal :(  - sweet pea Aranccini balls  - any of their delicious stuffed pastas  Really anything you have will be exceptional. The service is always above and beyond and they make a killer cocktail too!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there for new years eve dinner and had a great time.  The service was phenomenal and the staff there was quite knowledgeable about the food and wine.  We followed most of their recommendations and we're happy with our selections.  We had a risotto ball as an appetizer followed by beef shirt ribs and ricotta tortilloni for the mains. Lots of great options especially for my girlfriend who is vegetarian. I'm not a wine connoisseur but I did enjoy my glass of red.  Overall we enjoyed our food and experience. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"love the drinks here. the food and small plates are really good. i went on a date here, it was an excellent pick."}
{"text":"Excellent! It was a last minute decision to go to L'Unita and I'm so so glad we went. There was only space at the bar but we didn't mind. Adrian was an awesome bartender. Super friendly and informative! I started with a glass of montepulciano. Delish. My bf had a very good \"Tommy\". Apparently that is a double shot tequila fresh lime juice, grapefruit bitters and a bit of agave nectar. The bartender gave us a bit of their homemade bread which was described as \"the best bread I've ever had\" by my boyfriend. We started with a small order of warm olives. I've never had warm olives but I love olives so I'm sure I'll love them warm. And I did!!! Then I had a pasta with sausages squash and radicchio. It was so good, flavourful and fresh. It was my boyfriends birthday so we splurged and had cannolis! And again........ Delicious! I can't wait to go back. We are going to be regulars!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my top five favorite restaurants in Toronto.  It's a fantastic date spot (try to get a two top table in the hallway!) but also great to meet up with friends and family.  Excellent wine selection (Bastianach! yay!).  The service is consistent and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I can't believe there are so many 5 star reviews. Are they hiring someone to post all of these?  First, we were planning to have dinner at Dimmi's but they already had many people on the waitlist so we decided to try L'Unita. It appeared as one of the most recommened Italian restaurants in Yorkville. We ordered a pasta and the fish special. The fish special was great, however, the pasta was disastrous. The chef probably made a mistake and spilt the salt in it. I don't want to exaggerate but that's what I felt. Torontonians don't have salty taste and it was the most salty dish I've ever had durnig my 9 years of stay in Toronto. Whenever the waiter/waitress comes and ask how the food is, I never complain and just say they're all good but today, for the first time of my life, I said \"the pasta is too salty..\". Guess what happened next. The waitress said \"No way\" and left. She was smiling (or laughing). Overall, it was weird expereince. I'd suggest you to go to a cheaper restaurant with better food and atmosphere or to a high-end restaurant with nice food and service which worth the price. For those 2 dish, I paid slightly more than $70."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to eat here because we were looking for a nice dinner without getting too fancy. Needless to say this was exactly what we were looking for. Would definitely come here again. We got the orange and apple salad and the white pizza to share and it was perfect for us. The salad was very flavorful and had a really great execution. We got the chocolate baba for dessert and it was also amazing.  Service was great, very relaxed and super attentive. We wanted to sit in a more private area and regardless of the fact that it was pretty busy they made our request happen.  All together our dinner was $45"}
{"text":"Best carbonara in the city IMHO, every time we go there the service is excellent , the place oozes warmth and quality."}
{"text":"Very solid Yorkville restaurant.  Yorkville restaurants come in two categories - expensive/mediocre and expensive/pretty good.  This one is expensive/pretty good.  Space is nice and service was pretty good.  Food ranged for good to excellent.  I did find the food a little salty, as commented on by someone else here.  If the price tag is going to bother you then you can probably find better food at the same price by leaving the neighborhood, but if you've got the budget space then this is a good Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Four of us had a great dinner there on Saturday night. The ambiance, service and food are all topnotch in my books. I had a pasta dish that was incredible. Try it, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"What happens when a resto marksup wine at 5x and serves good but not memorable food at market rates? You decide not to go there again.  Service: Friendly  Ambience: they're trying for dark n rustic but it didn't win me over.   Mitigating factor: they've corkage at 30$ a bottle."}
{"text":"After a relaxing day at the Stillwater Spa (another review to come on that), my girlfriends and I decided to have an early dinner...we were starving. One of my girlfriends suggested this place after hearing rave reviews from another friend. It was a 10 minute walk from the spa and we were at the restaurant at 5:10pm.   Intro. The restaurant opens at 5;30 although the door is unlocked. We waited outside until 5:18 to which I went inside and asked if it was okay that we at least sit at the bar and have drinks while we waited for the restaurant to officially open. The guy had to consider hard before saying yes, and by the time he agreed, it was already 5:30 so... We were told that we had to be out by 7:30 (we did not have reservations, and as a FYI, when we left at 7:25 the restaurant was half empty...sigh)   They seated us right by the window which I am assuming is prime real estate. I would say that the best spot in the restaurant is spoiled by the guy continually banging on the coffee machines at the bar so that you feel you're sitting near a construction site.   Food. The best thing about this place. The menu is shockingly short, but boy does it deliver. The warm, fresh bread almost tastes like warm cake. I had the buffala dish which is soft cheese that is spread on more warm, fresh bread. Because I was very hungry, I ordered the short ribs where were absolutely heavenly. The meat just melts in your mouth and it comes with some sort of coleslaw which is a perfect and light side to a fatty short rib. My other girl friend had the duck and she also could not stop raving about it. Needless to say, the food here is very, very good. Dessert was mediocre. I ordered the sugar and chocolate donut which was essentially sugar encrusted timbits. Pass.   Ambiance. Dark with purple walls and chandeliers and mirrors. The service was efficient, but I think they also wanted us out by 7:30 - because I was hungry, no complaints about fast and efficient service.   All in all, if you were in the area, I would recommend this place although reservations are highly recommended. I think we were lucky to get a place because we came so early. However, I would not go out of my way to eat here, living in the Yorkmills area, so definitely, a local Avenue hot spot. Notwithstanding the average everything else, the food was very good and if you do have a chance, I would recommend coming here at least once."}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 (50% of final grade) Went for summerlicious, and the food was above par. Ordered the warm olives as an extra appetizer and it was YUMMY with the olive bread. The rest of the dishes were a nice contrast of flavours, but nothing worthy of anything more than a 3.5/5. In some of the dishes, the quality of the ingredients was evident. In other ones, I imagine I could easily find elsewhere.   Ambiance 3.5/5 (15% of final grade) They had a little booth with a little candle for my party of three, which was really nice to chat in. That is, before a bigger group of people came in and sat right next booth and it got really loud. The washroom itself was also very nice, with thick napkins. The stairs leading down to the washroom had rather narrow steps though, so be careful.  Service 3.5/5 (15% of final grade) We were promptly seated, and everything was quite standard. The reason why I upped it to 3.5 instead of 3/5 is because they accommodated with my request for hot water, and brought it in a very well placed metal teapot with a ceramic cup and a wedge of lemon. The thoughtfulness in this placement was very cute, considering that it was free of charge. I would give another half point for their product knowledge when they asked us if we had any questions for them, but the tone of voice they had was very unenthusiastic and sort of indifferent at best. That being said, our cups were almost always filled, and they gladly gave us more free bread when asked.  Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) What the food lacked in taste they made up for in presentation. For the $38 2016 Summerlicious menu, the experience wasn't \"OMG SO MUCH VALUE\". I can calmly say that it wasn't expensive for what it was, but it wasn't particularly affordable either.  Other 3/5 (10% of final grade) The arrangement of the food was very visually appealing.  Final Grade = 67/100 = 3 Stars  TLDR: The ambiance is nice enough for it to be a date-spot, but the food itself isn't something I would look back to craving. The presentation of the food was really nice though."}
{"text":"Loved this intimate, dimly lit, yet fab vibe restaurant! Casual and cool but upscale at the same time. Food was delicious! Sexy, buzzy and fun. Can't wait to go back, might be my new local favourite."}
{"text":"Went here last night for Summerlicious, the menu was excellent. I had the short rib crostini, the beef was tender and well seasoned, crostini was not too hard, and the accoutrements finished the piece well. As for the main (gnocci, fennel, parm and wild mushrooms), it was above average. I was not a fan of the wild mushrooms, they tasted a bit bland. I feel the dish could have done more justice if a cremini was used.  As for dessert, I had the peach/goat cheese crostini. It was like a deconstructed very creamy peach cheese cake - loved it.  Service and atmosphere was excellent! As we left, everyone said thank you and good bye on the way out. I am not one to normally rave about a place, but this was truly excellent.  Highly recommend for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing (we had the arancini, ravioli and tiramisu), great ambience for both a date night or evening with friends, and service was outstanding. Our server was Brittany and she was lovely. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing is better than a Friday date night at L'Unita.  My boyfriend and I have been a number of times and have never left feeling less than thrilled with our time spent there.  Great meals, great ambiance, great staff - seriously one of the best Toronto has on offer."}
{"text":"This is a decent cozy spot that seems quite popular. They seem to have some promo on slower days as the half priced wine Tuesday they had a packed house. I tried two reds (Chianti & Amarone) which were quite good at that price point.  I think I will explore their wine list if I revisit.  We had reservations that seemed to be the way to go. The ambiance is good with dim lights and warm inviting feel. The staff is welcoming from the start to finish so kudos for that. Three of us had the following Burratta with Beets: Very good and the better dish on what we tried. The pistachios and orange added another layer to this dish.  Margherita Pizza: The dough is decent yet the sauce had a sweeter note which threw this dish of quite a bit for moi. Wild Mushrooms Pizza: Decent attempt at this pizza with a wallop of truffle taste coming from the infused oil.  Winter Squash: Done well here. With a lot of herbs and a nice carmelized finish. Rigattoni: I didn't try this dish but apparently it also suffered from the sweeter than expected sauce.  I would say 3.5 stars for this neighborhood."}
{"text":"I only have good things to say about the restaurant. The atmosphere is romantic and cozy, our waitress was prompt to take our orders, very knowledgeable about the menu and specials, and all staff were friendly.   The food itself is delicious. The focaccia to start with is home made and so good I had to have more. We had the small charcuterie board  - lots of variety on it and quite large for a 'small' portion just for the 2 of us. The lamb bolognese and wild mushroom pizza were both equally delicious. The wine choices are also excellent! I will absolutely be coming back here and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Just squeezed into the last two seats on the bar and enjoyed stellar service from Michael. Tuesday is half price wine night, so be sure to book in a few days early. Both pasta dishes (fresh-foraged mushroom tagliatelle and beet ravioli) were delicious and cooked properly al dente, but the real stars were the Buffalo mozzarella appetizer and the rhubarb pana cotta with decaf cappuccino. Mesmerizing."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be amazing, unfortunately our last visit was a disaster. They made a valiant attempt to update bruschetta by topping it with a thick layer of what I believe was eggplant and cheese, that rendered the toasted bread soggy. It was a gooey mess. The meatballs had a strange consistancy, and the polenta was a dried fried block. We had to send the steak back; it was gamey and chewy.   The staff was wonderful.  I was so sorry to see the change in quality of this restaurant. I will watch out for future reviews and hope that things improve so I can return to this once sharp and yummy venue."}
{"text":"Overall had a good experience here. The atmosphere and service was great. Food was good but didn't standout to me as anything really that special. Arancini to start was very good. I had pizza and my girlfriend had pasta, and we both agreed that we like the pizza better. The atmosphere was dimly lit and very nice."}
{"text":"We're adding this place to our roster of ol' favourites after having spent a wonderful evening here.  This place is great. The food was fresh and delicious, and the service was impeccable. The atmosphere is warm and casual--lots of positive energy here.  Our server was friendly and professional. One of the owners, Dave, made an effort to make us feel welcome. He came over to introduce himself and chat with us. And by the way, their cannolis are amazing. Don't even think of leaving the restaurant until you have one. You'll die and go to heaven.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Tasty homemade pasta, cozy place, excellent service. They have 1/2 price bottles of wine on Tuesday, wished I'd gone then! I'd go again."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar and enjoy amazing cocktails with your food.  Adrian is an artist with beverages and the food is incredible.  Make sure you try the freshly roasted peanuts the owners mother makes fresh.  I constantly crave he radish salad and I never order salad at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here a few months back for dinner on a weekend, made resos - place was great, very dark but cozy - the artwork and brick walls were dope! ate way too much but it was all pretty good - the fresh pizza was excellent had warm olives and sardine crustini for apps - the sardines weren't the best but the olives hit the spot! great vino and exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Good service and ambient. Walking distance from Howard Jonson hotel. Hospitality since the arrival until leaving. Food have good flavor and came fast just in minutes after ordered"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, the staff are so attentive and friendly. The space and decor are upscale without being pretentious. A complete dining experience, and great spot for a date."}
{"text":"5 stars for both flavour and service! Extremely impressed. I'd say one of the best pasta's I've had in Toronto. Flavour and quality are right up there!   Went on an early Saturday night. L'unita was kind enough to squeeze us in (party of 2). Staff and service are very well trained.  Overall, had a great time and plan on definitely bringing my friends here next time!"}
{"text":"Really nice date atmosphere great food and an upscale clientele. You'll be alright here."}
{"text":"Spoiled brats! That's right! Thanks to the owners and staff! It's a sophisticated setting, yet you feel right at home! It felt more like going to a fabulously hosted dinner party rather than dining out!  \"Let me get your coat for you!\". Why, thank you! Right away, the hostess makes us feel warm and welcomed. The owner, David, while tending to an event next door, came to chat with us 3 times throughout dinner, and the witty and knowledgeable Nathan, had us roaring with laughter all night long! Shhhhhhhh! The food was good but I think Nathan's charisma may have out shined it!  We were all Yelp Elites but L'unita virgins, so we went for these dishes & sampled everything:  ricotta 'stuffed crust'   $18.00 tomato sauce, fior di latte & prosciutto  leek & fennel ravioli   $24.00 in-house pasta, pork sausage & charred beet greens   spaghetti alla carbonara  $25.00 fresh egg, house guanciale & pecorino  agnolotti with rapini and n'duja (chef's daily special)  * in-house pasta, truffle sauce, spicy spreadable sausage made with pork belly  In between the courses, the staff treated us to tasty freebies such as:  riceballs  crispy fried rice mouth-sized pockets, crispy and crumbly on the outside yet creamy filling inside  roasted chickpea salad *  simple, salty, savoury and almost crunchy  tuna tartare  refreshing and light, thinly sliced  sashimi with pin-thin slivered cucumbers   panacotti  fresh yogurt, mango puree, drizzled with honey, topped with oaty graham cracker crumbs and raspberry  dolce di latte zeppole  deep fried donut, frangelico crema, chocolate dipping sauce  The dessert here is so delish, I could come here JUST for THAT!  While you could taste the quality ingredients, the items with a ( * ) denotes my FAVOURITE dishes.   The consummate hospitality of the owners and staff here will charm you, the tasty dishes will get your lips to smile, and the atmosphere will lure you to stay awhile ... (our 4 hours stay felt like 1) ...   For romantic ambiance, fine interior, good food, ultra cleanliness, and impeccable service, L'Unita delivers in every category. Except kinda pricey for what you get, so save that chi-ching to dazzle that special someone!"}
{"text":"Lovely, warm Italian spot perfect for a date night. We went on Valentines Day and everything from the special cocktail to the antipasti to the delicious risotto & pasta dishes was perfect. The veal ragu in a white wine reduction was a fantastic dish for non red sauce seekers. Our waitress was so helpful and friendly. Make a res & go."}
{"text":"Unbelievable experience!  The ambiance and guest service was on point. Clair was our waiter and she maid us feel like we where the only ones here. You must stop by at some point.   The food was fresh and made with care. My fiancé and I are visiting from Orlando and we can wait till we come back to this beautiful city and eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Toronto's dining scene is so hot that L'unita was actually my 5th choice on the list of birthday celebration options. It did however come with recos from two foodies at work so I trusted it would be good.  Despite being told to try the steak, which wandered by and looked delicious, we opted for more traditional pizza and pasta.   We shared the bruschetta appetizer, which normally is \"yawn\" but L'unita's version is topped with ricotta that is whipped so it tastes like cream and topped with honey and orange zest. Amazing!  We shared the potato pizza and Spaghetti Carbonara. Both were too oily for my liking and quite the disappointment given the unexpected appetizer.  Because it was a special occasion we each got our own dessert. They have a pastry chef and it shows, b/c while the dinner was just okay, the desserts were very good. Mini donuts and a chocolate espresso tart.  One complaint here ... they ran out of milk so there is no way I could have had a cappucino - out of milk? Really? Go get some from a local grocery store.  I will say one thing ... the atmosphere is like a scene out of Rome. We were seated near the kitchen in a hallway intentionally used for couple seating and it felt like an alleyway in Rome. So while the food was just okay the atmosphere made up for it.  Oh and give yourself plenty of time to find parking."}
{"text":"It's been over a month since I went here, but due to the volume of my notes, I've been lazy about writing the review.  I should point out that I like the decor and ambiance here, they contribute to my dining experience.   Halibut crudo with citrus fruit, string beans, crispy garlic:  Light and fresh taste, especially due to the slices of orange and grapefruit.  Crispy garlic provided additional flavor and texture contrast.  String beans provided another texture dimension with their light veggie crispness.  A whimsical beginning.  Fried sardine fillet on focaccia with olive tapenade.  Warm sardines had tender flesh, and buttery-fatty skin which melted in your mouth on top of crisp focaccia.  The saltiness was perfectly balanced by the sourness of the olives and capers.  A great second dish.  Salumi platter contained a variety, which I really don't recall.  Most saliently, the prosciutto was the most tender I have ever tasted, not at all chewy.  Rapini with garlic, anchovy and chili butter, was subtly fishy to just the right degree.  Short rib with kale and sweet potato was satisfying, granted it's hard to screw up short rib.  Papardelle with Berkshire ragu was perfectly al dente.  Butternut ravioli was richly flavored, and the crumbled walnut on top worked very well.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly medium-rare as ordered, though perhaps a tad too salty (must remember to ask for less salt next time!)  Finally, the pumpkin tart with ricotta and caramel sauce was warm, mild, and smooth, with a light crust.  I was stuffed by this point, so I'm not sure how well I judged it, but it seemed like a winner!  Service was friendly, attentive, and prompt!"}
{"text":"Great Ave & Dav staple - have been many times and it has a nice romantic, stolen away vibe - great homemade pasta, though I would skip the gnocchi and the fresh cheeses, soups and bread are also awesome.  I like to sit near the front, because their high table & bar get good action...there are few awkward tables in what must have been the old hallway...if there are only two of you going make sure to request the main room.  You'll find an older, chill crowd, good, well priced wines and a modern Italian menu...service is great...not to intense, and the lighting makes even a tired working girls rushing straight from the office look glamourous...worth a try and good for groups up to 8..."}
{"text":"Was invited to check out a private media event hosted here concerning harvesting cranberries. Lol. It was actually cool to learn about how they can be used in a variety of food items and how they are harvested. They even brought in VR device to show you how it's harvested.   The restaurant decor is nice and the bartender was friendly. We got to talking and I learned he just came back from a cocktail competition. Lol.   It's located a bit out of the way, but could be a good spot to book an event or eat at if in the area."}
{"text":"What a wicked place located a bit north of Yorkville on Avenue.  You would think this would be some type of pretentious place because of the area but not even close!!! When you walk in you feel like you are at home because of the cool decor.  I heard Dave, the owner, put his personality into the decor and it's brilliant.  You just get a nice, chill, fun vibe right away.  The service is top notch and knowledgeable which i have stated many times in my reviews I am a sucker for.  Wicked service will always get love from me because in my field of business service is everything so I respect and expect it too.  I got the Bourbon sour...well I got two of them LOL but it was SOOO GOOD!  The food...WOW speechless in a good way.  We got the Arancini, which had a truffle and honey sauce that was...well let's say my reaction was \"OMG damn that is good\".  The bread that was served was homemade and soft like a pillow.    I didn't try the pizza but my friends said they always get it because it's one of the best.  I got the Gnocchi and let's just say i have never had it that good before, honestly.  Usually you get the small type but these were big, think of a two biter instead of one.    Then dessert, Pumpkin Doughtnuts (new to the menu) and Cannoli.  By now I was stuffed and after I killed the dessert I couldn't breathe but everything was amazing. From service, food, atmosphere, vibe and everything in between this place needs to be visited.  One of the coolest things I found was that the owner Dave took a lot of pride in his restaurant and you could tell because he would go and talk to the customers and make them feel at home, smart man.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"A very good but very noisy resto, serving a small number of mains. Their short ribs are wondrous, though the absewnce of veggies is a downer (why should I pay $6 for a veg?). Their wine list is very dear, but their house red ($42) was very good. Squid were raved about, ditto char, and pasta. Good service. But the noise level is terrifying."}
{"text":"Ok so there is so much to say about this place.   Had it not been for summerlicious I don't know that I would have found this place, but I'm glad I did!   We came here one night after a symphony and it was literally perfect. The food was so good I returned in the same week with another friend. I requested a quiet area and when I arrived not only was my request granted beyond my expectation but the manager remembered me by name and made a point to say hello.   Now for the important stuff! Service... Our server the first time was very sweet and pleasant but the second time... Blew us away. Our server Laura was amazing!!! She was hands down one of the best servers I've had in a long time! I never had to ask for a single thing, my cup was always filled before I even realized it was getting empty, my plates were taken swiftly and promptly after being finished and all was done with such a pleasant demeanour that I was compelled to return the next day with my family!  I love when a restaurants food is amazing but then is followed up my good service!   Now for the food...Delicious! Everything was perfection. Nothing overlooked, bland or dry. Simple but bold flavours and the hand made pasta well...to die for.   I would highly recommend this place if you had a dinner function to plan. Make sure to make reservations and don't forget that Tuesday is half price wine bottle day ;)   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time going there and we ordered takeout. Pretty pathetic sized gnocchi for $25! And no utensils made eating the food pretty difficult. Food pretty good but rather $$$ considering what u get. Cute looking decor- just don't order take out."}
{"text":"Went for a party, seriously impressed.  Delicious focaccia (sp) with oil, ceasar salad, cavatelli and those pastry things with cheese in the middle.    We're definitely going back."}
{"text":"It could be a 5 too, but my boyfriend and I are definitely fan's of this place!  Atmosphere was awesome; playing casual music from the past (think of the throwback 70's/80's) Nice little area around Yorkville; here for Summerlicious (but will definitely go back for normal menu)  Fixed menu;  Salad w/ Pecorino Cheese/  West Bay Clams w/ zucchini Seared Trout/ Frenched Lamb Strawberry Cheesecake Gelato  and ordered a side of the Funghi pizza.  For the appies: Let's just say; the salad presentation is quite dreadful; looks like a pile of random greens thrown on a place with hideously shaved cheese scattered around; BEYOND that it's a burst of delicious flavours a very cohesive balance of citrus and bitterness. The clams were more on the spicy side; but complimented the clams and bread   Between the entree's I must say that the Lamb won between the two dishes but the trout was seared to perfection (more towards the medium side) which made it flakey and flavorful)   As always the dessert is the best; and you wont be disappointed with this choice whatsoever.   Not to sweet not to heavy it was just perfect.   As for the pizza; let's just say amazing. Then again; anything with mushrooms I'm happy. A pizza is def recommended esp if you're doing the summerlicious menu!  Buono Appetito!"}
{"text":"I wish I had known about this little gem sooner (apparently it had been open for exactly 8 years on the night we dined there)!  I have so many great things to say about this restaurant; I'm not quite sure where to start.  The staff were friendly and gracious from the moment we walked in.  Everyone from the gentleman who greeted us (who I think was the manager) to our waitress to the other staff who assisted with our table was super friendly.  The service was quick but I still felt like I had enough time between courses and that I wasn't rushed.  Our meal started with complimentary bread and olive oil.  I'm not sure if it's because the bread was slightly salted on the top, but it was delicious! (I think the only thing that could have made it better is if it was served warm - I LOVE when restaurants serve warm bread).  We ordered the sweet pea arancini to start (3), which came with a mint and lemon aioli.  I really liked this as it was different from typical arancini, which are usually served with a tomato sauce.  They were filled with rice, peas and onions.  I definitely could have eaten more!  I ordered the dolce salumi pizza (tomato sauce, fior di latte, artisanal pepperoni, red onion and fresh basil).  This pizza is AMAZING!  The tomato sauce is slightly sweet, which is a great contrast to the savoury pepperoni.  There was a good toppings to crust ratio (not too many toppings that it weighed down the pizza).  The best part about it was the super thin crust.  Typically, when crust is this thin, it tends to get soggy, but this crust was slightly crunchy.  Delicious!!  I had a glass of the Cave Springs riesling to drink with my meal.  It was really cold (which I love), crisp and slightly sweet.    We were too full to eat dessert, but there were a lot of options that all looked delicious!  I really liked the atmosphere.  It was dimly lit with a lot of candles, which created a kind of romantic atmosphere (which was perfect, seeing as I was there with my boyfriend).    I was so impressed with this restaurant and I cannot wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of sampling many of the small dishes here, as well as the (very tender) braised beef short ribs.   Most memorable: the warm olives, the sardine crostini and the lamb sausage bruschetta!   Food was excellent, service was excellent and the atmosphere was great. I can't wait  until I win the lottery so I may happily continue my many returns."}
{"text":"We went for dinner to this restaurant. The food was absolutely amazing. All the good reviews that I have read about this property are true. But I'd like to give a big shout-out to Sophia who made our experience  much nicer. She was extremely polite, knowledgeable, professional, nice and friendly. She had other tables but never failed on giving the best service to our table. Thanks Sophia!"}
{"text":"The highlight of a Summer night outing  In all aspects of life, one takes comfort in relying on excellent purveyors, service providers and restaurateurs. L'unita is such an establishment which can be counted on to be the torchbearer for hearty, unpretentious Italian cuisine in our fair city. There are few other Italian restos that have been as consistent over nearly a decade as this wildly popular Av & Dav Mecca. For us,  L'Unita represented the ideal dining experience whereas Il Fornaro, also on Avenue Rd., was the nightmarish opposite.   Great food coupled with poor service can suck all the joy out of dining out. However, at L'unita you'll find the service standard equal to everything coming out of the kitchen. John, our server, exemplifies intelligent, polite, unobtrusive yet always present when needed level of service. The simplest, and yet often missed, an indicator of attentiveness is on how timely a basis water glasses are filled. No need to ask here as it was replenished with nary a mention from me.   Two of us begin with the Lamb Spiedini (skewers) on an apricot conserve and a gremolata of fresh mint. In presentation, taste and portion size one couldn't find a fault with this app. The lamb was tender and incredibly tasty, with the apricot and mint complementing and enhancing the dish.   While one chose the Cucumber and Strawberry Salad w watercress, arugula, poppy seeds and Parmigiano. Which they rated as quite good and delicious, what more could you ask for?   The three of us unanimously and without too much discussion hone in on the Grilled Albacore Tuna sided with green beans, summer radish, smoked potatoes & tonnato sauce. Thank goodness we did. Soon after our plates arrive the table fell silent and the only audible sound were quiet moans of culinary joy. We were in agreement that this was probably the best Tuna dish we have had in our collective dining lives.   How does one equal, never mind top, such an outstanding three-star main course? By employing an immensely talented pastry chef.   For dessert, everyone picked a different offering which covered the whole menu.  One opted for the Espresso Panna Cotta with chocolate mascarpone, amaretto caramel & coffee crumble. While the quantity on the plate seemed modest they needed \"my help\" to finish the dish. The rich, smooth and wonderfully rendered dessert left us with a smile of satiated joy.   The other diner was drawn to the Vanilla Pound Cake with lemon curd and miniature meringues. An attractive plate garnished with fresh mint leaves managed to balance sweet and tart nicely.   I chose the slightly restrained but no less satisfying Goat's Cheese with an ash rind accompanied by a peach marmalade, wildflower honey and crostini. The cheese was served at the right temperature, critical to really appreciating its strong lingering flavour, and the desired sharpness contrasted beautifully by the marmalade and incredible honey sourced from a local apiary.   By omission and certainly not intentionally it has been five years since my last meal at L'Unita. I have no intent on waiting for another five to repeat such a pleasurable dining experience."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious and am glad we did! Everything was wonderful from the service to the atmosphere to the food. Server was very knowledgeable of the wine list and made some great recommendations. I had the  Fior di Latte Mozzarella with charred orange, toasted pecans & chicory, which was simply perfect. For my main, I had braised lamb tagliatelle 'verde' radicchio, fresh mint & peperoncino. It was quite good. For dessert, I went with the amaretto profiteroles salted caramel mascarpone & vanilla cream - delicious! Loved the atmosphere here - exposed brick, candlelight, and cozy. Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Starting off with the atmosphere, it's a really nice vibe. Cozy, candlelight vibes, lots of wine and mingling, upscale but not pretentious, just very enjoyable.   The wine list is really extensive, they give you a long book and a smaller drink menu with favourites and top choices.   Onto the food the most important part, I don't know if I would call it very authentic italian, more italian inspired. Appetizers and starters: Antipasto piccolo was pretty good. I thought the prosciutto was good but nothing to write home about, and the bread this came with was meh and not italian. Grilled octopus tasted to die for but for 19 dollars for the starter it was just two tentacles. Now the focaccia was absolutely heaven, which made up for the bread with the antipasto because we ate it with that.   The sea bream was good, the pairing with leeks and potatoes again were great but my partner complained about portion size. Same with myself and the agnolotti. While I'm not usually one to complain about price, just 25 dollars for like 10 small agnolotti stuffed with some cheese was disappointing. I have to say their pasta is made in house which is great but it just didn't translate to the flavour that night.   My friends with the pizzas enjoyed them and that was much more bang for your buck with a good full sized pizza with great flavours.  Our server was really great tho, she did an amazing job at making us feel welcome even though it was only her first week she was knowledgeable.   Overall, tax and tip being 180 for two people, we weren't wowed or very full for the most part."}
{"text":"Incredible Italian food. Beautiful atmosphere. Friendly service. You will not be disappointed. I would return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"After a long day of bringing relatives to rehab, missing subway stops and tromping through knee deep snow, my closest friends and I gathered for our usual weekly catch up dinner. This time we found ourselves wandering the streets of Yorkville. We settled upon a quaint, dimly lit restaurant  at the corner of Avenue & Davenport.  Italian is not usually our first choice on account of my nearest & dearest sister having a life long unrequited hate on for pasta. However, the 5 of us decided to nestled in closely to one another for a few liquid appetizers hopefully to be followed by a glorious arrangement of entrees. We were greeted by the staff with warm smiles and an endless array of compliments on everything from our red lipstick to our little black dresses. Within seconds a tall dark and handsome man appeared at our table, whom might I add I had secretly hoped was there to whisk me away. (Turns out he was only there to serve us our water & take our drink orders...such a shame). I happened to order myself some sort of blueberry and gin concoction which turned into another, which then turned into 4 ...I highly recommend you ask about this at the bar. Once our entrees started to arrive we were all pleased to find beautifully arranged and garnished dishes being carefully placed in front of us. My friends and I have never been able to keep our hands to ourselves, so naturally our table quickly became a free for all lioness feeding zone. After devouring our prey we decided the night would only be complete with a little bit of sugar.(and since I decided it was probably a little too inappropriate to proposition the waiter for that) we ordered a round of Sicilian kisses and their self proclaimed famous cannoli.  All in all it was a fantastic experience. The staff were all very friendly, the portions were more then generous, the drinks delicious and the cannoli was heaven sent! It's a great place for dates, dinners with friends and family but as my friends would all agree more importantly a great place to babe watch."}
{"text":"I went here for winterlicious. Since I was alone, I sat on the bar. So I got to watch the bartender closely, who is obviously not very professional. I'm a little bit off the topic. I ordered winter green salad, red wine risotto and apple fregolata. The salad, omg, the only thing I can remember is greasy and salty. And the risotto didn't leave me much impression. And the apple fregolata,which was a recommendation of the waitress, was way too sweet.   Well, nothing really impressed me and I expected something better, and more satisfying. I'm disappointed"}
{"text":"Romantic? Check. Classy? Check. Melt-in-your-mouth Italian dishes? Check. Enough said. Love this restaurant and loved all of the food I had. We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Amazing service, excellent food!  Staff: Wow, they know how to make every customer feel special and are very attentive. When I first came in they offered to take our jackets, and of course I'm like a bull in a china shop and all my stuff goes flying everywhere as I try to empty my pockets. They were very sweet about it as my face was probably beet red (it was a very cold Valentine's Day, so I was much more bundled up than usual). They are so knowledgeable with their menu and are glad to answer any question without you feeling ashamed if you don't know anything about food. They also noticed that our candle went out (due to my longwinded conversations) and quickly came and reignited the flame. There are so many little things that they are so attentive to and it made this the best experience I've had. They were very understanding when we suddenly had to leave due to personal matters and got our coats and everything very quickly for us. It was all very much appreciated!!  Ambience: This place offered the perfect amount of romance and intimacy, but also great for casual diners too. Although it was candlelight, it also had plenty of lighting and was still bright enough to read the menu with ease. The seats were very comfortable. And they even had pillows for the bench seating to aid with comfort. The tables are a bit small for two people but the staff cleared plates often so it was not a problem. So many fine details done very well!  Food: We had the Meatballs and Polenta to start and it was amazing. The sauce was rich with flavour, the Meatballs just melted in my mouth and the Polenta was a great accompaniment balancing out the rich flavours. My mouth is drooling just thinking about it again. For entrees we shared the Cavatelli con Zucca and the Barese Sausage Pizza and all I can say is WOW! The pasta was excellently made and cooked and the squash and the radicchio went great with it providing great flavours and texture. The Pizza was just as amazing and I loved the Barese Sausage. I find that sausage can be overpowering with flavour but this was perfect balance of seasoning and tenderness. I wish I had more time so I could've tried the desserts because they looked so good!  I haven't had such an amazing experience and I am just dying to come back!"}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the kludge of a website that is design heavy but lacks substance. The experience of a meal here will delight your senses. We enjoyed the company of friends visiting from CA. Sat near the back of the room with comfy sofa like bench and pillows that allowed us to enjoy the fishbowl quality of the room. Sumptuous color palette featuring exposed brick walls with attention to detail. Loved the  style & quality of the light.  This detail followed throughout from service to the end product: Highlights included the short-ribs that had the most beautiful caramelized au-jus, the pea soup, and the Gorgonzola gnocchi (made in-house.) Sorry to tease...   The wine list leans heavily Italian, on the spendy side. We enjoyed a mid-priced 2004 syrah 'cortona', luigi d'alessandro, toscana syrah.  We can't wait to return to l'unita. It's a little slice of heaven right here in T.O."}
{"text":"We came here on a night out sans bébé and we had such a great meal! Not only is the ambiance rustic, charming and elegant, the service is highly personable, unpretentious and friendly, and the food is top-notch! We shared the pizza special (with pancetta), the butternut squash agnolotti and the cauliflower, followed by the chocolate gelato. We also had a bottle of wine.  We were asked if we were celebrating something... to which I replied, heck yeah, a night out sans bébé ;)  A great restaurant in Yorkville, refined without an ounce of pretension, my kind of place!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  Surpassed my expectations by far.  The food tastes just like it came fresh out of \"Nonna's kitchen\".  The staff is spectacular as well making it more than just your average restaurant but more of a dining experience. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)  I came here for Summerlicious in a group of 6 for a girls night. They gave us the long communal table with high chairs by the bar. The place is dark and lounge-y. The flatscreen TV plays classic Italian movies. On this evening, it was \"La Dolce Vita\" (also, ask your server if you want a 2 for 1 voucher for admission to the Fellini: Spectacular Obsessions exhibit at the TIFF Bell Lightbox). Music ranged from instrumental jazz to Motown classics.   Food was great and I liked that they had a good selection for Summerlicious (4 appetizers/4 mains/3 desserts to choose from). I find some other restaurants only offer 2 or 3 choices during Summerlicious. We had to ask the server a lot of questions because for almost every item on the menu there was a word we didn't know (and I eat a lot of Italian food!). I had the baccala (that's just Italian for salt cod) montecato served with fried polenta and spinach. The cod was almost pureed and rolled into a ball, then fried. It was tasty and not too fishy. The polenta was a bit too crunchy for my liking. A smooth polenta would've made for a better combination. But the spinach was nice and garlic-y. For the main course, I had the sweet pea trophie. Trophie is a short, twisted pasta similar to fussili but skinnier. The pasta here is homemade and had a really great texture to it. It was served in a basil pesto with peas, ricotta cheese and mint -- a light, summery dish! Last but not least, a decent espresso panna cotta.   I also tried some of my friends' dishes. The heirloom tomato panzanella with 2 kinds of basil was a favourite. It's sort of like a bread pudding with tomatoes... that sounds weird. It had pieces of bread that were crispy but not hard like croutons. The spagetti with clams was yummy too. The pasta portions were not very big, which was perfect since we were having 3 courses. But they listed the individual prices, and the pasta dishes are $22-24 which seemed like a lot for such small dishes. I don't know if the portions would be bigger if you weren't ordering from the Summerlicious menu?  Drinks were good and our server was also the bartender, so he had lots of good suggestions (although service was understandably slow since he was busy making cocktails between serving tables! I feel like they should hire a separate person). I had the strawberry fields cocktail (grey goose, strawberry puree, basil) which was sweet, but not too sweet. We later shared a bottle of Italian white wine (most of their wines are Italian).   The meal ($35 prix fixe) + drinks, taxes, and tip came out to around $75 per person. So it is still on the pricier end, but definitely a nice treat."}
{"text":"We had the grilled octopus, 10oz steak strip, and red wine. I specified that we wanted the steak to be on the bloody medium rare side, as well as the dishes to come out one at a time, and they came out that way. Both dishes were cut for us and were wonderfully smokey and flavorful. Service was top notch. Ambiance was romantic."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious dinner ($35) with a good friend on a Thursday evening. She ordered  Arancini Bolognese (tomato sugo & parmigiano) and I ordered  Barese Salsiccia  (poached egg, ciabatta & tomato marmellata) for starters. The arancini was delicious! It was fried perfectly so that it wasn't too hard to bite into and there was just the right amount of cheese. The Barese Salsiccia was average. The sausage was nothing special and although the egg was cooked perfectly, there's really nothing special about an egg on top of a piece of toast.  For mains, she ordered Cornmeal Stracci Pasta (porcini mushrooms, savoy cabbage & ricotta salata) and I ordered the Wild Boar Risotto (toasted chestnuts, rocket & parmigiano). I'm not a fan of her pasta, probably because it was made with cornmeal so it tasted odd to me. However, she really enjoyed it and got her pasta craving satisfied. At first bite, my risotto was not the texture I expect it to be because I thought that it'll be softer. They used a harder rice for this dish and as I got used to the texture, I really enjoyed my dish. The chestnut in the dish really added to the flavour which surprised me because I've never had chestnut with rice before. The portion of both dishes were very generous which I really appreciated since I was starving that night!  Lastly, my friend ordered  Tiramisu Doughnuts (espresso mascarpone & cocoa) and I ordered  Heather's Butter Tart (vanilla gelato, candied chestnut & amaro cream) for dessert. We both thought that the flavour of the doughnuts was going to be a tiramisu flavour. It was actually doughnuts on top of tiramisu. I thought that her dessert was done very well. The doughnuts were very soft and the tiamisu went well with the doughnuts so that the whole thing wouldn't be too dry to eat. The butter tart was good but not as amazing. There was chestnut in the dessert which I should've read more carefully because I was having a chestnut overload. I personally thought that the pastry part was done very well which might have something to do with the waitress telling me that the chef was a pastry chef. My overall dessert was a bit too sweet though so I was on a sugar high as I was leaving this restaurant.  The staff was incredibly friendly and the service here was excellent. They refilled our water very frequently throughout the night so our glasses were never empty. I would definitely come back here for dinner to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"The service we got here was GREAT. Honestly, if it wasn't the best service I've ever had, it was really close. Our server was knowledgable, friendly, kind, helpful, conversational, and just the kind of server you want to have. She made our meal extra great. All of the staff seemed great and we were given a warm welcome. Our table wasn't ready because we were a bit early but we were offered to start a drink while we stood by the entrance. All of the staff that we interacted with or watched were being super professional, kind, and attentive to the diners. Owner/manager seemed really nice.  The atmosphere here is PERFECT. Dark, candlelit, but still lively. Upbeat music. I think it's ideal for someone who wants to take their date on a romantic dinner but doesn't want the romantic part to be awkward or overkill. Not pretentious. Like a fun bar atmosphere only dressed up nice. (But YOU don't need to dress up!) The place was packed on a Tuesday night with happy laughing people. I LOVE the atmosphere here so much. Passing by at night looking in the window made me really want to make reservations here.  Tuesday is half-price wine night which means you can have your $28 glass of wine for $14. So, not the best \"deal\" but I really enjoyed the wine I picked. The server was happy to recommend it to me and help me choose from the menu all of my food items. I liked that!  Their bread with olive oil to dip in is very good. The mushroom brushetta was good but messy- do not order it on a first date. The ravioli was very good without being amazing. For dessert we had the panna cotta and the cannnoli and I do recommend them both! YUM!  I enjoyed it here, I'd return, and I recommend it to you. The food was really good without completely wowing me but we had a great meal here.  Lots of happy regulars. People sitting at the bar eating and drinking were having a great time. Bartender seemed really engaging.  Reservations a must. House was packed on a cold, rainy, dark Tuesday December night at 9pm. Maybe half price wine night is a huge draw or maybe it's always like that."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here for our anniversary recently based on the great reviews, and boy are we glad we did.  We walked in to this beautiful little restaurant for our reservation and were promptly and happily greeted by the man behind the bar. We were seated immediately and given menus (although I had peeked at the menu earlier and already knew what I wanted). Our server was lovely and asked if we'd ever been there as she went through the menu with us.   We ordered the polenta and meat balls to start, which were phenomenal. The serving comes with either 3 or 5 meat balls (I don't remember) so we ended up fighting over who got the bigger half of the remaining ball. I had the steak for my entree which was delicious. I eat my steak blue, which I find is hard to order in restaurants because most places overcook their steaks, but this was cooked perfectly. My fiancé ordered one of the pizzas. I don't remember which one because I was enjoying my own meal too much, but he quite enjoyed it.  Over all this place is amazing. Fair price for  delicious food and great service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Number 9 of my Restaurant Resolutions completed!  http://nearafar.wordpress.com/2011/12/19/near-the-2012-restaurant-resolutions-list/  And I guess I was saving the best for last. Whoo Hoo! Where do I begin? And yes, my meal was compensated (but not for this review specifically). I will be going again and paying my own way.  And yes, very long review ahead! I'm not going to lie: We got spoiled.   VIBE  It's a sophisticated, dim lit place with all of the cliched factors in place: exposed brick walls, hardwood floors, and nicely set tables. It's all there. You'd expect the douchey Yorkville, banker crowd to be here but it wasn't like that. In Yorkville, of all places, this place felt so unpretentious. And immediately, you do feel like you're welcomed into your very chic friend's place for dinner.   I'm immediately met by the owner, David Minicucci, who is the consummate host. Have a seat at the bar. Don't mind if I do! I get water, my drink and even really flavourful nuts. I have a good conversation with David and the bartenders for about 10 minutes. Not many owners do this. Not many in Yorkville either. It was a nice change (though this might not happen on a weekend, per se).   It was a very memorable three hour meal.  Service, of course, was flawless and impeccable.   Ultimate date place or one to pop the question for sure.    WE DRANK DRINK:  For the bar, I started with the pineapple gimlet. It was so fresh, so exciting. It has my favourite libation of choice, gin, hendrick's gin at that, apfelkorn apple liqueur, st. germain and fresh pineapple over ice. If you like your cocktails sweet, this is a good choice.  My wine choice (or rather, the restaurant's) was the 2010 Pra Soave Classico, white wine that was just sweet enough and went well with the many fish and pasta dishes that we had.   WE ATE  A note: Mike Angeloni is the chef here. You may know him from the Black Hoof and his recent stint at F'Amelia. I was wondering where he went! I'm surprised his turn as chef here isn't getting more attention because dude knows how to COOK!  Run, don't walk kids!   Olives -- warm, lovely olives of different sizes. One of my favourite things ever. And they don't skimp either!   Tuna Conserva bruschetta--this was a very hearty portion and a bit awkward to eat.   Cucumber & Radish Salad--this was yummy and lighter. A good palate cleanser for what was to come. It had yogurt, spring onion & dill with it. I love dill.   Grilled octopus & n'duja--one of the highlights for me. It didn't look like it had a million tentacles on it. The chickpeas gave was a good complement to the chewiness of the octopus.   Leek & Fennel ravioli - this was a good one but I was more focused on the carbonara to be honest. Inside, you get pork sausage & charred beet greens. It's nice but I like the punch of cheese from the carbonara below.   Spaghetti alla Carbonara--one of my most favourite things ever. The egg was waiting to be cracked. Everything was so fresh and of course the cheese..THE CHEESE. I could have easily had the whole bowl (I think I did!). It's a big portion so if you're doing multiple dishes here, make sure you're sharing. It's a lot of food!   It was served with side of polenta with brown butter & sage and the sweetness of this dish (it kind of tasted like it had a maple syrup tinge to it) complemented the tenderness of the pork belly. This was a pretty generous serving as well. Again, make sure you have some room!   DESSERT  I didn't think I could eat any more but the desert here is off the chain. OFF THE CHAIN.  Vanilla yogurt panna cotta  --not sure exactly how healthy it is, but it's delish and surprise! it's served in a mason jar. I loved the layers of this dish. You have to break through the oat brown sugar crumble to get down to the bottom where this really nice chunk of lemon curd is. OMG, it's so good. The mint is a nice touch!   Dolce di latte zeppole --this is now one of my new addictions. It's dough on crack. There was literally steam coming out of the donut when dipped into the chocolate and frangelico crema. This will definitely be on my twenty tastiest things in Quarter Two.    http://nearafar.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/20-tastiest-things-ive-eaten-in-toronto-in-2012-quarterly-review/ It was the perfect end to a lovely meal.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  You will get the #foodcoma shakes. We were still full THE NEXT MORNING.  As said, I'm coming back here. This shall be on the regular list! It ain't cheap but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Cozy Italian place at Av/Dav with a menu that beats other Italian restaurants hands down. Delicious Italian wines all of which are enjoyable (ok I didn't try all but I tried most).The Caesar salad is one of the best in Toronto. This is a very comfy place to enjoy very good Italian food, wines and hospitality without going to Little Italy (or big Italy). Service is very good and prices are good especially for the location."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here and we were disappointed. The other times everything was en point - service and food.  This occasion we had a waiter that pretty much ignored us, so much so that we had to get up to get our bottle of wine (he placed on a shelf) to pour it ourselves.  For a 400$+ dinner I would expect a bit more attention meaning not having to ask someone to clear our table.   The food is amazing tho, so im torn as to wether or not I would return."}
{"text":"Food is superior and well prepared. Mostly traditional Italian dishes. The special are superb. Atmosphere is dimly lit and romantic, but still maintains a \"vibey\" and lively air. It's a great place to take a date or a significant other.. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and go out of their way to ensure a perfect dinning experience. The wine list is complete, but can be expensive. (At least you have the option, if you want to go to town and order a high end Barolo or Amerone to go with your Fillet on the bone). Expect to pay typical top downtown prices, but at least you will not be disappointed with the experience. The location is on Avenue Rd. in northern Yorkville, so it is convenient if you want to head to a bar or a patio for an after dinner drink or coffee - or just a walk. Parking can be a challenge."}
{"text":"What a wonderful neighbourhood find... Though I have it 4 stars, it's really a 4.5 star experience.  Service and staff is honestly one of Toronto best and there are some wonderful dishes coming from the kitchen.  I can't believe I didnt find this place sooner.  L'unita isn't flashy or bold compared to many of the other Toronto restaurants but what it offers is really well done.  A warm and inviting atmosphere that is really perfect for a nice date night.  The dimmed lighting, well spaced tables, and cozy seating gives a feeling that puts you at ease and ready to enjoy the night.  There are zero pretentious attitudes here... honestly perfect for any time you want a great Italian meal.  The staff quickly greeted us and there was never a moment where our water went unfilled or plates sitting.  I find the service competing against some of the best Michelin Bib Gourmands in Chicago.  Really great!  As for the food... some really well done.  I would recommend the arancini (comfort food elevated... creamy risotto like interior but with a healthy dose of squash to give it a sweet twist and more creamier texture without making it heavy from dairy), carbonara is a generous helping of delicious pasta that is so hard to stop eating, and you cannot leave this restaurant without trying their cannoli (often done wrong but the perfectly crunchy exterior houses the most wonderful creamy candied orange mascarpone Ive had in a long time).  We also got the several other dishes that were good but not a must get (grilled octopus... very tender but could use a bit of a bit more flavour heat and served more warm, brussels sprouts... wonderful side but would try the cauliflower next time).  Overall, wonderful night and will be coming back... really well done."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom this friday that just passed and I must say I am still thinking about how amazing this place was. From the moment I walked in I fell in love. Its a really cozy and romantic restaurant thats not overly pretentious with just the right amount of flair. I also loved how it was elegantly decorated but was still hip and casual. Overall, the atmosphere for me was a 5/5!  Now on to the important part, the food! The very first thing I put into my mouth was the complementary focaccia bread with heirloom baby tomatoes on top served with a side of olive oil, and I must say that this was possibly one of the best complementary breads I have ever eaten at a restaurant. We were off to a great start and this made me even more excited for my main dish. I ordered the braised beef short ribs and my mom ordered the lamb bolognese. Both dishes where were a 5/5, and that is saying a lot considering i dont even like pasta. Everything was fresh, juicy and very homemade like which I loved. After dinner we decided to order some dessert just so we could stay here longer and just chit chat so we decided to go with the sticky toffee pudding. This was the first time id ever tried sticky toffee pudding so I didnt have much to compare it to but i must say that it was absolutely delicious paired with a nice hot cup of the l'unita cappuccino. Overall, the servers were very polite and helpful and knew exactly when to come and when to leave us be so we could just enjoy our food, as oppose to constantly hovering over us.  This was an amazing dinner experience and i will most definitely visit again soon. This is also a really cute place to go for a date or just for an occasion where you would like to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I came here on Friday with my husband and my parents. We had an amazing time at this restaurant!! Our reservations were for 6:45, and we didn't leave until 11:30, if that's any indication of how much fun we have!  To start with, the restaurant is beautiful and quaint. Although the restaurant is quite narrow, it is made to look bigger because the walls are lined with mirrors. It really does have a romantic atmosphere - it's quite dark and every table had candles. The service was excellent - attentive, but not overly attentive.   We started with the swordfish crudo, which was a special, and the arancini. The arancini were nicely cooked, flavourful and I appreciated the addition of the butternut squash. Everyone loved the swordfish, which was fresh and light. For my entree, I had a pizza with pepperoni. The crust and base for the pizza is really nice and crispy. It was excellent, and I would definitely order it again! I had a piece of my mom's pizza, which had primarily sausage on it. It was alright, but the sausage was quite sweet rather than savoury, which I wasn't expecting.   The food is good, and the atmosphere is amazing! We will for sure come back."}
{"text":"Made a choice for our anniversary and it didn't disappoint at all. with advance booking and a full house we got the best table at L'Unita. The service was magnificent. The Italian food authentic and tasted like home food. It's now my favorite in the Yorkville area."}
{"text":"Excellent !!! Service fantastic as is food , nice  wine list just loved it ... recommend it highly"}
{"text":"Food is 3.5 but 5 for Service! I did not have any prior expectations for L'Unita as this was a surprise reservation by my significant other. I have to highlight, after reading all these yelpers rave about the service, that they are indeed top-notch. We were almost half an hour late to our reservation, but they still accommodated us and even saved us nice seats by the window. Our server Diana was wonderful! She was genuinely friendly but not in your face, gave great suggestions, and was very attentive. This is the kind of service that makes you glad you're paying for a $25 pasta (thought I did not get the pasta at the time).  They brought us the house-made bread to start, and it's one of my favourite. Wish I can remember what it's made of..   We got the warm olives to start - did not have any so can't comment. My boyfriend said he was not a fan. Grilled octopus - served with nduja sausage, fior di latte and bomba. I like this dish, octopus was grilled tender and with a bit of heat from the house made bomba. Our server personally recommended Wild Mushroom Bianca pizza - truffle sauce and wild mushrooms. The pizza is thinner than I like as it became quite soggy.. but I'm glad they did not over do it with the sauce as it was still light and with a good amount of cheese. Not a fan of the crust. I have to rave about their house made bomba, which is amazing.. goes really well with this particular pizza and gave it a nice kick.   Overall, I did not find the food amazing.. I didn't think about it much after. But, it is worth going at least once.. still a solid dinner, with amazing service. It was consistent with everyone who's ever stopped by our table to refill our water, or bring our food. Good for date nights or group dinners as there will be something for people to enjoy."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister for a girls night - and while this is definitely more of a date night restaurant than a girls night restaurant, we had a great time! Attentive service, a warm atmosphere, and delicious food all made for a fantastic experience.  We started with marinated olives, arancini, and wild mushroom bruschetta to share. All were delicious! I had the Brussels sprout carbonara for my main, which was rich and tasty. My sister also loved her butternut squash ravioli. To finish we had the dark chocolate torta, which was probably my least favourite item of the night - the chocolate flavour was just ok and I didn't love the amaretto caramel with it."}
{"text":"L'unita is dark and romantic! Great date restaurant as everything and everyone looks so much better after a cocktail or 2 in such a dim candle lit restaurant.  I can barely read the short menu and the wine list, but at least our nice waiter let me borrow his flashlight!   Food is on the pricier side with salad at  around $15, pasta at around $25 and main from $30 and up and the portions are small! But at least I can eat my app, main and dessert without stuffing myself!   Everything we ordered are well prepared with the fresh ingredients and in fact I feel healthy eating here. Love the Capricco and Ravioli!  L'unita won't disappoint if you are looking for more unique Italian fare not your usual seafood linguine experience!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was amazing! Our server was Michael and he was great! We had someone with an allergy to egg and Michael helped us figure out what we could order for him. He even had the chef make us something off the menu for him! The food was so delicious as well. Do yourself a favor and go eat here!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day and had a good time. The atmosphere is perfect for a date... dimly lit with candlelit tables and an overall cozy feel.   The service was great, our server was attentive but not overly like some places can be. Not pushy at all even when we were done with our food and were just sitting there enjoying each other's company.  Food was tasty but nothing super special that wowed me.  The arancini was really good though... the outer layer was perfectly thin and crispy and the inside cheesy. I had the rigatoni which I thought was just decent and my boyfriend had the mushroom pizza. I personally liked the pizza more than my rigatoni.. the truffle taste really stood out. For dessert we shared the cannoli, which comes in three. It was my first time trying a cannoli and was super yummy! The white chocolate bits throughout were so good.   Overall a good dining experience that I enjoyed."}
{"text":"I have been to L'Unita on multiple occasions and have always been blown away by their food and customer service. Because of this, I decided to host my birthday dinner at  L'Unita. I had about 16 people attending and we were perfectly taken care of by the staff. The food that is produced from their kitchen is just mouth watering. Everything is so fresh and the quality is outstanding. I am looking forward to my next L'unita visit!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little osteria with a seriously good menu and a nicely-curated wine selection, I hear the pizza's great but it's hard to pass up those primi and secondi!  The service is almost joyful, maybe not truly in the spirit of professional Italian restaurant service but very welcome just the same.  Of course it's a great couples' place, but a four- or six- top is 'way more likely to enjoy digging into the wine list, so bring a couple of friends and have yourselves un ottimo momento, or something like that!"}
{"text":"When it comes to the 'licious events, I always have my old favourites, but I make sure to try at least one new place each year. This time, I checked out l'Unità with a girl friend, a place that I've been wanting to try for quite some time. Dinner here was priced at $35 per person. Now onto the food!  Arancini bolognese- tomato sugo & parmigiano The arancini came piping hot and were absolutely delicious- crispy on the outside, and meaty in the centre. I would eat this any day.   Barese Salsiccia- poached egg, ciabatta & tomato marmellata This was my friend's appetizer, and I think we both agreed that out of the two, the arancini was the winner.  Cornmeal stracci - porcini mushroom, savoy cabbage & ricotta salata I also enjoyed my vegetarian pasta- the mushrooms added earthy, vibrant flavours and I loved the rusticity of the dish. The portion size was also really big, so I was able pack half of it for lunch the next day.   Tiramisu doughnuts- espresso mascarpone and cocoa This was a little bit of a letdown, mainly because I had envisioned tiramisu-flavoured doughnuts. In reality, there were actually 3 timbit-size doughnuts sitting atop a tiramisu. I actually thought the doughnuts were a little dry and lacking in flavour.   Heather's butter tart- vanilla gelato, candied chestnuts & amaro cream Mel's butter tart was the better dessert, although it was way too sweet to be eaten all in one sitting.   Even though the desserts missed the mark for me, overall, I still enjoyed my Winterlicious meal at L'Unita. The arancini were definitely the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing dining experience!  From the starters (focaccia and oil) until dessert (smores) the dining experience was just perfect!  Ambience: casual romantic. Crowd at 9pm on a Thur night was local and relaxed.  Food: order the olives and the steak- you won't regret it! We asked our server for several substitutions, and she happily obligated.  Coming back again."}
{"text":"The staff at L'Unita are simply exceptional, we've never seen such a passionate and knowledgable team. They make you feel welcome and known every time you visit. The dishes were all perfectly cooked and presented, with bold flavours and incredibly fresh ingredients. The wine list is exceptional and the staff are very passionate about selecting the right pairings for your food. They also have a very well stocked bar with an incredible selection of Scotch, Bourbon, Grappa and everything else you might want. Honestly. L'Unita is our favourite restaurant and every time we go it just gets better."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here on an early Friday evening for dinner. We were kindly greeted upon entering and complimentary coat check was immediately offered. The hostess then led us to a spacious table in the centre of the restaurant. Unfortunately we both were wanting something a bit more cozy and asked for a table along the banquet. Our waitress said she would check and let us know. She quickly returned and said no problem and led us to a much more intimate table along the cushy banquet against an exposed brick wall adorned with large antique mirrors. The restaurant is very dimly lit with candle light at the table and classic Italian music playing overhead.   Our waitress returned to go over the specials for the day and take our drink orders. I was a little torn between two cocktails but our waitress was great at providing insight and helping us decide.  Pear Sparkler - vodka, apfelkorn, aperol, pear nectar, angostura & prosecco Alright don't let the name fool you! Beware this drink packs a punch! I was expecting a light fruity drink but it was definitely heavy on the liquor or maybe the bartender had a heavy hand. It was still enjoyable just not what I was expecting. Hubby ordered another cocktail that was supposed to be something mixed with orange soda and it was exceptionally strong as well, even for him.  On to the Food...  House bread - This was too good to be free! Fresh baked focaccia with a fluffy soft interior and a bubbly crust flecked with sea salt was scrumptious and the perfect mop for a glub of that delicious olive oil.  'Nduja Arancini - puttanesca tomato & parmigano These little golden nuggets came out piping hot and jam packed with a creamy rice filling and oozing with cheese. They sat on a bed of spicy tomato sauce which was the perfect dipping sauce to give it a little kick.  Bitter Greens Insalta - radicchio, Bosc pear, almonds, & ricotta salata These greens were well dressed in a creamy sweet lemony dressing that helped mute the bitterness along with the crisp sliced pears, I loved the toasty almonds that added another crunchy, and what's not to love about the heavy dusting or snow fall of ricotta salata.  Margherita D.O.P. - San marzano tomato, fresh basil, fior di latte The crust was perfectly thin and crispy with a subtle smokiness from the wood fire oven, light on the cheese and ample sauce. I only wish the tomato sauce had a touch more sweetness to it as I found it to be a bit too sour for my liking.  T-Bone Steak alla Fiorentia - roasted garlic, rosemary, sea salt & olive oil Our steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned and simply melted in your mouth like butter! So juicy and tender the steak was definitely the highlight of the meal. Oh and those buttery garlic cloves are always a hit!  Brussels Sprouts - sherry vinegar & almonds This was more of a salad/slaw of thinly sliced and shaved brussel sprouts dressed in a tangy vinaigrette. Again more crunch provided by the toasted almond slices and a surprise of thinly sliced deep fried garlic pieces. I wish I new this was a cold side as I would have ordered a different dish as I wanted a hot side to pair with the steak.  Tiramisu Della Nonna - espresso & kahlua lady finger cookies, mascarpone zabaglione & chocolate That yummy kahlua was definitely present and forward in this dessert, the mascarpone zabaglione was on the thicker side and that really glued the dish together I would of liked a little more moisture or more espresso in the dessert to even things out a bit but it was none the less delicious and I ate every last drop.   We also ordered two cappuccinos which came a bit after my dessert. We felt maybe it was sitting for a while as it was Luke warm when it was arrived and really nothing to write home about.  Overall the service here was impeccable as glasses were always promptly refilled before going dry, the tables was always cleared of plates and wiped of crumbs before the next course arrived, new cutlery reset, and napkins refolded when leaving the table. Although parts of the meal were hits and misses we still had a great time and are still reminiscing over that t-bone!"}
