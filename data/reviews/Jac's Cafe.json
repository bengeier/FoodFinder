{"text":"We have eaten breakfast here 3-4 times and was very pleased each time.  Once my husband had to take a call and when he returned he was asked several times he wanted them to reheat his food."}
{"text":"Food is ok/good, but having to sit and listen to the old guy regulars who are experts on local politics is just painful. I've only been here a couple times, and each time ones of these old McKeesport Yinzers has had to say something to me when, honestly I could care less to talk to you. I'm not from McKeesport, I could care less about what the high school football team did in 1965, and I even care less about current McKeesport politics.  I just drive past this place on my way to work and sometimes want food on the way there. Probably won't go back anytime soon, since Taco Bell has breakfast now, and a drive thru."}
{"text":"The food is sometimes good, sometimes not so good. The bathrooms are very dirty and the tables are sticky. Maria is a dear, as is her son. Owner sometimes is friendly, other times ignores you."}
{"text":"The middle of my delicious looking apple streusel pastry was full of mold. Imagine eating 1/2 of a pastry, pulling back some apples, and seeing a massive cluster of fungus. How old was that thing?   When I excused myself to go to the bathroom, I discovered that it is used as dry storage, probably a health code violation, especially since it appears to not have been cleaned ever.  That being said, I did not expose the pastry there because they are just so nice.  I ate a few bites of my breakfast, which was about as good as anything that I would prepare myself.  My dog ate well  I wish I could say this is a hidden gem, but it is just a small cafe full of health code violations."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with some friends and they have definitely got comfort food on the menu! They have a small selection of homemade pastry goodies and the food that we got was pretty good, down-home breakfast foods, but... I'm going to be super honest, here...  This place did NOT strike me as very clean. I couldn't help but notice the floor along the walls and baseboards, the window sill that we were next to was really dirty, the menus had that greasy stickiness to them, etc. I don't know, it just struck me as somewhere that I wouldn't want to return.  If they did some deep cleaning, I'd consider going back, but if that's what the easy-to-clean public dining area looks like, I can't imagine what the hard-to-clean greasy kitchen area looks like!  Also, the women that waited on us weren't overly friendly to us--I felt like we were bothering her when we needed simple things... like silverware.  I'd like to give it a retry because a very good friend of mine is a fan, but (minimally) they really need to buckle down on the cleaning for me to try again!"}
{"text":"The place is filthy because it is covered in grease.  They have no ventilation system, and they probably aren't up to code.    Mediocre coffee, mediocre service, mediocre food.  The interior of the place is really off-putting, as if they furnished the place with found objects (dishes and silverware included) from someplace like the goodwill.  Coming to and from the parking lot is no easy feat either."}
{"text":"when it comes to breakfast spots around the mckeesport,white oak area  theres not to many options.  this place got that home cooking feel to it because they cook the food basically right next to you. which leaves you smelling like a pancake for the rest of the day.  only thing I dont like about this place besides leaving there smelling like a pancake is that their scrambled eggs are always runny.  but their cookies are great baked fresh daily , and they give you a big ass cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I've been here on two occasions - each were exceedingly positive. Both times were for a late breakfast prior to enjoying rugby games at the Norwin Soccer Complex. The first time I was wearing a Green Bay Packers shirt and received a good natured ribbing with lots of smiles when I gave it right back.   The food was fresh and homemade. The portions were well above average and prices were very reasonable. My first experience, I had two cups of coffee while seated and they offered one in a styrofoam cup to go on top of that. That is a restaurant that identifies the wants/needs of the customer and surpasses them.  Today I had an enjoyable biscuits and gravy breakfast. It could have been more assertively seasoned, but was delicious nonetheless.  I intended on stopping by on the way home to pick up some bakery items, but my game ran late and they were closed."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendship. My wife and I both love the breakfast sandwiches and more."}
