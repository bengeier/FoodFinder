{"text":"Not a great cafe for an art museum. I expected more but alas coffee was what I wanted and coffee is what I got. The guy working behind the counter didn't seem too enthusiastic about his job. Thankfully, the selection of food and drinks certainly made up for this. There isn't much else to say but if you're in the North Side of Pittsburgh, this may serve as one of the few coffee shops around."}
{"text":"Looking for a pick-me-up after meandering through the galleries at the Warhol Museum, I headed down to the basement to get some coffee from their café.

I was tempted to get food--the grilled cheese looked especially tasty--but I just wanted a quick caffeine fix. I ordered a latte with an extra shot. I figured a triple-shot drink should have been bold enough to power me through the rest of my day. Not so much. This was some of the weakest coffee I've tasted! Even with three shots of espresso, the drink tasted weak and watery. Maybe I've come to expect stronger coffee, but this was a bit of a letdown.

And I caution against visiting around lunchtime--I managed to sneak in right as the lunch rush of school groups started. So unless you're prepared to spend lunch dining with chatty teenagers, get to the café early."}
{"text":"I was expecting this to be lame, but it was fine. The coffee was really good and reasonably priced, the service was super friendly and they had really good tomato soup too!"}
