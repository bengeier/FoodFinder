{"text":"Had lunch here Friday before a soccer game at John Carrol U.  At 2:00 PM, well past lunch hour, this place was packed.

The hot  Pastrami on Rye with Swiss Cheese and Russian dressing was outstanding.  It was well worth $9.40 and was overstuffed with tender, tasty Pastrami. Others in my group enjoyed their sandwiches as well.

TIP:  Consider how hungry you are before ordering soup and sandwich.  They have no cups. Their regular bowl is large and their \"big\" bowl is a meal all by itself."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the, if not THE nastiest restaurant around. If you want good corned beef go to Slyman's. The corned beef at C & L is fatty and undercooked.. just nasty. And the pickles are a standing joke. Hey, nobody *really* eats those, do they? My dad and I have a running joke that some of the pickles from when he was a kid are still in with the newer ones.
But seriously, you'd figure the \"Jewish standard\" for corned beef would at least be halfway decent. But in my opinion It's atrocious. Service is.. don't even go there."}
{"text":"I lost my corned beef and pastrami virginity at Corky & Lenny's, and can't believe I waited so long!  Had been going here off and on for a few years when visiting family, but only had breakfast or the non-deli items.  If I had simply stuck to these sorts of things, I'd probably be giving a two star rating, but oh, the cured meats!

  Corky & Lenny's easily rival legendary delis like Zingerman's in Ann Arbor, but costs you less and give you just as gigantic a pile between two slices as the others.  Not sure what other reviewers are saying about cranky/unpleasant service, because I've had nothing but attentive and pleasant experiences here.  The only crank I've run into is the older lady in the Harry Caray glasses that's always working the register, but c'mon, that's part of the charm!"}
{"text":"We don't go here very often, but when we do, the food is always very good. Their menu has a wide variety of options. 

On our most recent visit, our server was pretty rude and got some of the order wrong. It was disappointing, though not exactly surprising from this place. It's never really been known for its service, just the food. 

The shopping center it's located in (Village Square) has a large, free parking lot, but it can be difficult to find a spot at times. 

I still prefer Corky's over Jack's Deli, so if you're looking for a high-quality Jewish deli, I think Corky & Lenny's is your best option."}
{"text":"C&L's is actually more like a 2.75 in my book, but sadly that option doesn't exist. Aside from the draw of the nicely preserved horseshoe-shaped counter, their matzoh ball soup, cabbage soup and potato pancakes are all wonderful-better than Jack's Deli, in fact. However, basically everything else at Jack's is superior, from the meats to the coleslaw (do not even get me started on C&L's sad excuse for coleslaw), and the prices are better."}
{"text":"It was a chilly day so we stopped in to get some corned beef sandwiches and Mish Mosh soup to go.  It was 4:00 on Friday and there was 4 people ahead of us.  We waited 20 min. just to place our order as people came in behind us who were acquainted with the owner (who stood by the checkout) or some other employee to place their order.  We also noticed a full tub of corned beef brisket sitting out on a cart between the deli and pastry counter exposed to people who were standing in line sneezing and coughing.  

50 minutes total for a to go order of 2 CB's, soup and 2 knishes while the others \"in the know\" who came in behind us were processed and gone.  Rye bread was dry and fell apart while trying to hold the sandwiches, Mish Mosh soup was bland, had no carrots and the knishes appeared overcooked as the crust was tough, appeared slightly burned and the corned beef inside was dry. The owner didn't seem to mind the slow service and the germ exposed food as he was engaged in a b.s. session the whole time. We have been here in the past and it was o.k., but we will just be moving on in the future."}
{"text":"I found a STAPLE in my eggs this morning. When the bill came- they had not taken my eggs off the bill. I told the owner and she said \"well- we remade them.\" They would not take the eggs of my bill. Mgmt is offensive at best. Will never go again."}
{"text":"Drove up to Corky and Lenny's from Columbus this past Saturday.  I used to live in Shaker Heights and I do miss eating a really good corned beef sandwich every once in a while.  It was worth the drive, thoroughly enjoyed it. Our waitress and the rest of the staff were friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Best corned beef sandwich I have ever had.  Sauerkraut balls are delicious.  I highly recommend this deli"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets for Jewish kosher style deli in Ohio. I am Jewish and Ohio is the pits for this style of food, I take trips just to NYC for the deli. I am glad I found this place near Beachwood OH. The sandwiches are huge and very tasty, this place reminds of a real NY style deli. Great job guys. Keep up the good job at Corky and Lenny's Every time I go to Cleveland this is my place to eat."}
{"text":"I'll start off with one of the only positives, they have good bagels. On to the negatives. I ordered a lox omelet and I was quite disappointed. I've never seen lox like this before. It looked like ground salmon. I've never seen anything like this before #sad. Easily the worst lox I've ever had. My friend ordered a turkey burger and it's safe to say he was even more disappointed than I was. It was literally just a turkey burger patty. No bun, no lettuce, no onion, no tomato. Nothing else but a dry pathetic patty. Would never recommend this place to anyone. Oh yeah and I guess there was another positive. It's a good place to people watch..."}
{"text":"I find the reviews of this place very interesting!  Either people love it or hate it!  I enjoy a little Corky here and there!  They bring pickles fresh to every table.  They no longer leave a bucket on the table like the good old days. Great breakfast food.  Tons of sandwiches and Jewish deli food. Known for their soups (no vegetarian soup). Good for families and children!"}
{"text":"When I was a kid my mom would take me here after shopping at beachwood place. This is where I discovered halvah. I love this place. I love the pickles on the table, borscht, and the matzoh ball soup the most. The sandwiches are really big, and the meat is good quality. The deli cases are full of all variety of preserved fish, which I find fantastic."}
{"text":"One word:  Weak.  All-around this was weak.

When we walked on for lunch, around 11:45, the 250-year-old hostess was sitting at a table on the floor eating a sandwich.  She \"greeted\" us with complete disgust, as if we were an interruption to her day.  With a mouth full of food, she waved us over with a two-fingered \"come here!\" walked us over to a table and literally threw the menus down on the table and walked away without a word.  Not a \"hello,\" or a \"enjoy your meal,\" or anything.  She walked back to her table, continued to devour her sandwich until the next guest interrupted her meal.  

Our waitress was friendly and attentive, really on the ball.

Our food was really average.  My co-worker got the corned beef sandwich for $10, while I got the smoked turkey, for around $8.  Both sandwiches were really nothing better than what I could get at the Giant Eagle deli counter.  Just nothing special.

I've been here a couple times over the years and clearly they're banking on local nostalgia, and the office parks within a 5 minute drive for business.  The quality of the product for the price is just not worth it. Especially with the horrible \"greeting\" from the hostess.  

Drive the extra 4-5 minutes and head to Jack's Deli on the other side of Beachwood.  Better food, great service and much more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"As a recent New York transplant, I stumbled upon Corky and Lenny's while looking for something to eat.  The first time I walked in it was around closing time but they were still more than willing to serve me.  The sandwich I ordered was excellent and the service was prompt.  I've been back two more times - once ordering from the deli counter again and once sitting down at the counter.  If I find myself in Beachwood again, I'll be sure to stop there for lunch."}
{"text":"We stop here every other time we're in the area.  Usually order some kind of corned beef or pastrami sandwich plate.  Usually OK, but nothing really to write home about. This time I went with their Wednesday specials: decent split pea soup, but awful \"Hungarian Goulash.\"  It was an overcooked beef stew, and looked and tasted as it had long ago seen better days. Yet they got away with charging $14 for it (it does come with a salad). Dinty Moore's in the can miight be better."}
{"text":"Extremly rude waitress.  Place was filthy.  Could not eat the food after realizing how truly dirty the restraunt was. Kindly talked with manager and they could care less.  Stick a fork in them the legend is dead."}
{"text":"The food is really good.  Corned beef sandwich is very good.  Salad is good.  Service is hit or miss.  Some can be a little on the rude side."}
{"text":"Not so good compared to many other deli's I have been to throughout the country. Had the cabbage soup and a pastrami on rye. Both were bland and tasteless. Even the rye was so so. Most deli's include a pickle or pickles with a sandwich, but not here. They seem to be going through the motions and are living off a reputation from years gone by. Server was great though!!"}
{"text":"If you like AUTHENTIC delicatessens, you have to visit Corky's, great corned beef and awesome atmosphere! Menu is full of variety."}
{"text":"Always a great place to stop by in Cleveland for soup,Sandwich & desert.l'll always drive 30 minutes out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"It was a real treat to visit Corky & Lenny's. I am from Seattle, a city not famous for good Jewish Delis. My husband's family is from the Cleveland area and they've been eating at Corky & Lenny's for years. This past Thanksgiving weekend I experienced Corky & Lenny's for the first time. The restaurant is located in a strip mall - nothing fancy, but the owner, Earl, greeted us at the door and we had a great experience. We ordered matzo ball soup, along with  pastrami and corned beef sandwiches. I LOVED their crunchy kosher pickles. The corned beef was out of this world. Great service, nice people. I will definitely go back next time I am in town. Pictures on my food blog http://apassionateplate.com/pastrami-or-corned-beef-2/"}
{"text":"This place is HORRIFIC. I spent forever looking at the menu trying to find something that sounded remotely appealing, and ad to settle. I have never had such a greasy, poorly prepared meal. On top of the disgusting food, I have to say, the staff was awful. Our waitress was rude and not attentive, and the same goes for the other staff around. 
I felt like the entire place was dirty and cheap; I do not even want to imagine what the kitchen looks like. 

Basically, do not go here if you have any sort of standards."}
{"text":"First off, let me preface this review by telling you I have been told by NUMEROUS people that I make the best Matzo Ball soup (so I will forever be \"chasing the dragon\") AND secondly, perhaps I was UTTERLY disappointed simply because this place was held in such high regards by my Husband and step children and all I kept hearing is \"we have to go to Corky and Lenny's\"...\"you have to get the Sauerkraut Balls\".....\"they have the best corned beef\"...blah, blah, blah. WELL, I DID try the balls and they sucked! I DID try the corned beef and it was right up there with the worst I ever had (very fatty and tough) and don't even get me started on the matzo ball soup! I can't imagine why this place has received so many decent reviews-perhaps it's hard to accept the (fatal) fall from grace that this seemingly once hallowed institution has succumbed to OR perhaps it's that many Ohioans haven't been to a really good NY or LA Jewish deli BUT this native New Yorker can now say she ate at Corky and Lenny's (alongside her husband and step children) and everyone HATED it!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was standard, food sent out in a timely manner. Server was professional n attend as could be w the croud"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. I was recently in the area and just had to have corky and lennys. The food was good but not worth the wait and the service was horrible.  I can't remember the last time I experienced such a lack of professionalism. I must say though the manager was wonderful- but that's where it stops."}
{"text":"I have extremely fond memories of sitting in their Cedar road location as a little girl stuffing myself silly on corned beef, pickles and latkas. Not much has changed as this is my order at Corky and Lenny's every single time I'm still back in town. 

Nostalgia aside, their corned beef is the stuff of dreams. Insanely tender, so thinly sliced and it just melts. Amazing damn stuff. Their latkas are crispy and yet creamy and just the right hint of onion. I've tried so many times to recreate their latkas at home and have never managed to achieve the latka-perfection of Corky and Lenny's. 

The pickles (you have to ask for them now), are classic crock pickles and I have not one bit of shame that on this last visit I dominated that little silver dish and ate every last single pickle by myself (my table-mates can get their own damn pickles). 

I should note that I will sometimes get the corned beef on latkas but I usually order the rueben sandwich with no thousand island, add sour cream and yellow mustard (old school Cleveland May Company style). Then I order 3 latkas on the side, they are always good to take the extra home. I eat half the sandwich (remember I ate the pickles already), and at least a latka and half (maybe two if it's been a long time since I've had them)

I still love Corky and Lenny's with all heart and wish I could transplant them to Milwaukee."}
{"text":"Nobody needs a good sandwich that badly! Went back-to-back Sundays to get breakfast once and sandwiches the other time. Bottom line, the service is bad but the real kicker is that hostess had to get in an argument with a server because her server wasn't serving her personal friends quickly enough. Then my 12-year old had to listen a server call another server an a-hole. Sorry, this schtick doesn't work for me. Won't be going back unless for take-out."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by for breakfast a few days ago after avoiding this place for a couple years. I've no complaints about the food. The eggs ordered were made perfectly (over easy), and the french toast was tasty. And the prices were fair. 
My biggest complaint with Corky & Lenny's is its lack of service. The restaurant was not very busy the morning I stopped by. Waitstaff were apathetic and showed no interest in providing any kind of service. Food came out pretty slow (about 20 minutes after placing the order).The table, silverware, and plates were filthy. One has to wonder how this place ever managed to pass sanitation and health code inspections."}
{"text":"it was cold on aprill 23rd, so a giant tanker of mish mash soup was the perfect way to start lunch

a king size corned beef & swiss - (the server seriously asked if i wanted it on rye - it should only be served on rye) - finished it off right"}
{"text":"Just finished the most bland salad ever!!  $13 for iceberg lettuce and old lunchmeat.  Terrible!  Waitress was great but food was awful."}
{"text":"This was a nice little surprise to find. Parking can understandably be difficult with the strip mall being shared with a TJ Max and Whole Foods. The atmosphere is very pleasant, with extremely friendly staff. When I ordered, the server was knowledgeable and gave suggestions when asked. 

I ordered the hot corned beef sandwich, which was probably the best corned beef I've ever had. The meat was full of flavor and, most importantly, wasn't dry. Our server also didn't disappear once the food arrived and continually checked on us. 

For dessert I ordered the chocolate cream pie, and boy was it delicious. Rich and creamy. 

Overall, I would definitely return and order this food again."}
{"text":"I love Corky & Lenny's easily the best corned beef in town. Pickles great, atmosphere great. They definitly know whey the are doing!"}
{"text":"Excellent large sandwiches. 
Best jewish-style deli in the Cleveland area. Excellent sandwiches with heaping portions of meat. Recently renovated and modernized the interior though it still remains an informal eatery."}
{"text":"The place has fabulous food and fun, courteous staff that make visiting a joy - and eating even better."}
{"text":"I've dropped in here before to get deli and dessert trays for work. Actually got to sit down this evening. Absolutely great little Jewish delicatessen."}
{"text":"Terrible service, rude and slow.  Greek salad was anything but Greek....it was just lettuce some crumbs of feta and canned black olives.  Again, bad service."}
{"text":"I love a good corn beef sandwich and this place definitely had it.  The sandwiches were huge.  You can't find a good deli like this in every city.  The unlimited pickles definitely add a good touch to this place."}
{"text":"Good corned beef sandwich and mushroom barley soup, sandwich was so big I could only eat half. Great place for a quick bite to eat while satiating the need for deli sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm guessing this place run's on nostalgia because it's not the service... This place is about a mile away from my work and I had heard about them before so I decided to check them out.

No one greeted or served me when I came in. I hovered awkwardly around the deli counter. It took 5 minutes for someone to notice for me and take my order: I ordered the Corned Beef Reuben wrap to go, almost 10 dollars for a hefty wrap and a 1/2 cup of cucumber/tomato salad but I figured if the food is good- that's not too bad.

While I was waiting for my food I noticed most of the doors on the deli case were open even though some temperature sensitive stuff: Salmon, mayo based salads, cream cheese were in there. Employee's were all 50+, moving slowly and not changing their gloves in between orders. I.E. Placing chicken salad on bread, mashing it down with gloves then grabbing the whole head of lettuce to put a few leaves on the sandwich. Yuck.
At 15 minutes I had to flag someone down and check that my wrap was actually being made. Finally the lady came out with my wrap and handed it to me, no \"thank you, have a nice day\" nothing.

The corned beef in my reuben was delicious but really wasn't the best I've ever had, the \"famous\" pickles were nothing special and it tasted like they added sugar to the tomato/cucumber salad... I won't be going again. It wasn't awful but for $10 wraps, I can get better service elsewhere..."}
{"text":"First let me say my corned beef and pickle were delicious. My issue isn't with the actual food it's with the staff. Girl checking me out was yelling to someone else how she was going to \"beat someone's ass\". And I saw another staff member leaning on the counter talking to a guy behind it. All the while his arms are actually touching some diners food that is waiting to be delivered and he's  talking mouth-level right into the food. Absolutely last time I go there. Ghetto classless staff."}
{"text":"We have always loved C&L because of the really good deli, the hilarious atmosphere, the incredibly comprehensive menu and the gruff wait staff.  So we will continue to go whenever we are in Cleveland.

That said, why can't these guys sell half sandwiches?"}
{"text":"Corky and Lenny's is a pretty good restaurant. When you walk in, you're greeted by employees cutting fresh meats, and the display of desserts all by the side of the entrance. As you wait in line to get your table (which won't take long. Even with the brunch crowd I've never been waiting for longer than half an hour), you can see all the diners at their tables, and the cute little bar near the front. The tables are nice, and the booths are comfortable. They have a large offering of authentic deli-style foods like corned beef (sooo good), available in sandwiches, melts, and even latkes! The complimentary pickles while you wait are delicious. I got the Caesar salad without tomatoes once, and it was delicious, although there was an excess of cheese and dressing. I did give Corky and Lenny's 4 stars, though, because a few times there have been long waits, or no tables available. Sometimes the staff was inattentive or kind of rude. All in all, Corky and Lenny's is a good deli-style restaurant with very delicious food, but it's not the best."}
{"text":"Stopped here for the very first time, and I was impressed with the atmosphere, friendliness and the food.  Delicious mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"The corned beef is excellent. I do not say that lightly. It is excellent.  Which makes what I'm going to say even more important: the latkas are 10x better. And you can get a corned beef sandwich with the latkas as the bread. The latkas... are better than my mother's. And if she ever sees this, I'm getting a serious beat down. This place reminds me (in the best of ways) of my grandparents old deli."}
{"text":"First time here. Not one complaint. GREAT FOOD AND WONDERFUL STAFF. Try the cheesecake. You won't eat anything else. Lol great family environment.."}
{"text":"Nasty nasty people. Yeah, good deli, great potato pancakes. But it all comes with a huge side order of 'tude. They are not the only gig in town. If you need platters, call Jack's. They are gracious and accommodating.  I called corky's recently to confirm a shiva delivery and they were rude and actually hung up before completing the conversation."}
{"text":"I love this place, I have yet to find a place in Chicago that compares, but no luck.  I attempt to go there when I'm in town to get a bagel & lox to cure my hang-overs."}
{"text":"It had been a few years since we've been here for breakfast- it used to be good. This past weekend we went and were pretty disappointed with the quality of food. I ordered challah French toast which at Jacks Deli is thick and delicious, but here was not discernible from run of the mill French toast. The bf got eggs which were super over cooked and hash browns that were basically mashed potatoes. And for the love of God, that woman who seats people is the most unpleasant human."}
{"text":"I really wish I had been able to sit down at a table and eat lots of stuff all afternoon long. There could be a menu item called \"Jewish girl from Brooklyn Sampler Special\" or something. This is what I would have wanted to try bites of:

Corned beef, pastrami, roast turkey (with all 8 kinds of mustard)
Potato knish
Stuffed derma
Matzo ball soup
Pickles of all varieties
Bagels, lox, whitefish salad

But anyway, that didn't happen. Instead I hopped in for takeout after a dentist appointment down the road. Once again, I almost got sideswiped by an old lady in the parking lot who really shouldn't have been driving. I ordered two sandwiches on rye (turkey and corned beef) and two potato knishes. I grabbed two cans of Dr. Brown's for the nostalgia factor.

My husband went apeshit over the corned beef. I had two problems with the turkey. First, it was that slimy processed deli turkey, not the roast turkey these delis are famous for. Yes, it was my fault for not clarifying, but when I ordered \"turkey\" from the guy who must have been slicing sandwiches for thirty years, I would expect him to say, \"roast turkey or sliced?\" to let me know there were two options. Second, there was lettuce on the sandwich, which i didn't order, and which, when I got home, was soggy from the thousand island dressing. 

The bread was great. The pickle (dill) was crunchy and good, although I prefer sours or half-sours.

The knish was, sadly, a disappointment! Hard, dense, and overall, just difficult to eat.

I'd like to try other parts of my Jew from Brooklyn sampler at a later date, but for now, my preference is Jack's over Corky and Lenny's. What I appreciated more about the deli was the sensory experience walking in, as opposed to the food itself."}
{"text":"Our last visit to Corky and Lenny's was not up to the usual epicurean standards. Both our soft salami and turkey pastrami sandwiches were dry and hard to eat.  We ate half the sandwiches and left. What has changed? My unsweetened iced tea was warm and just ok. Not sure we will stop in after our next Trader Joe's stop."}
{"text":"Major thanks to everyone working tonight!!! Called after they closed because my daughter -sick w/the flu/ was craving their Matzo Ball Soup-hoping they were still open... They waited in the parking lot as we drove to get there -to hand-deliver her soup!!! So appreciated -service and caring like this is so rare these days!!! Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of corned beef in my life. This is the Gates of Divinity of corned beef. It's a great thing to have some cousins in Cleveland who grew up eating at this place. You folks really are spoiled... The chopped liver is really good  too. We northeasterners are deli snobs...and this is my is my favorite deli anywhere in the good ol' USA."}
{"text":"We were in town for a wedding and needed a deli fix.  Yes, the corned beef and tongue sandwich and the cabbage soup  were wonderful.  Yes, the rye bread is to die for.  Yes, the cheesecake is out of this world.  But what tops it all is the service.  This is not one of those in-your-face insult delis.  Our waiter, John, could not have been more eager to make sure we had a good time.  And when I said I was curious about what a sauerkraut ball was, he suggested I stop at the counter on the way out and just buy a single one as a taste.  The counter-man went one better--when he heard we were from Chicago he heated one and gave it to me (it's really more like a riff on a Reuben--corned beef and sauerkraut breaded and fried/baked like a meatball) and sent us home with two slices of mondel bread for good measure.   Good food, fair prices, friendly service--it doesn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Best corned beef in Cleveland.  Hands down, Slyman's sucks.
It compares, if not SURPASSES Canters in LA, and/or Carnegie in NY."}
{"text":"Cory and Lenny's was a last minute lunch idea after shopping at the Whole Foods next door. We got seated right away and sat at the bar area. The staff was all very friendly. One of the managers even came to talk to us and see if we needed anything. The waiter was very nice and was always there in time to fill up our glasses!

The menu had a good variety of items. The pricing was pretty reasonable as well. I got the strawberry almond salad with chicken. It was delish! The chicken was cooked well. My boyfriend got a sandwich, which he also enjoyed. 

The desserts were starring us right in the face and looked absolutely amazing. I opted for the chocolate fudge cake which was heaaaaavy and perfect for any chocolate lover!
The place seems very popular and was pretty busy. It seems like a very local type of place with a special charm!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! The staff is a little rude, but worth putting up with because the food is delicious! I highly recommend the Challah French Toast and the Corned Beef Hash. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The review is for the restaurant. (The food in the market section up front looked like it could be potentially good, but we were here over a recent holiday weekend for breakfast.) 

I was expecting some good, decent solid deli-style food. What we got was eggs that were probably poured from a carton. Everything was bland, blah and undercooked. Nothing was even remotely flavorful. 

Special bonus for the morbidly obese man sitting near the door making fun of us in between huge gasps for air. Yeah, that will make me run back to this joint, for sure. 

It was a one-off that we even went (we're visitors) but I recommend that people run away from this place as if they are on fire. It might work as cheap slop for the over 80 crowd, but anyone with functioning taste buds will want to steer clear."}
{"text":"Hasn't improved much since my last visit a few years ago.  Plus, the place isn't any cleaner.  Bathrooms were bad and it was only 1030AM.  We had breakfast which was acceptable, but nothing great for the price. 

It was nicely crowded on a Saturday AM, and cotton tops abound; reminded me of Florida.  Where does the younger set go?  Maybe Jacks?  

We asked about WiFi and they said we could sneak onto SBUX's signal, which is next door.  Strange thing to say."}
{"text":"Great bagels (made by Biali's) and cream cheese (home made).  Interior is dingy and in need of update."}
{"text":"I have got to say I was greatly disappointed.  

First, we were seated within 2 minutes.  So it was a little crowded but seats to go around.  From there, it went downhill fast.  It took about 20 minutes for someone to come and take our order.  Mind you the whole time we only had the small glasses of water that within 10 minutes were empty...and remained empty the entire time.

Orders were taken and then ... 30 minutes later a Corned beef sandwich and French toast came out.  

So, the French toast was good.  No complaints.  My hot corned beef sandwich came out cold.  Seriously, not even attempted at 'hot'.  Just 2 pieces of dry rye, some dry corned beef and two slices of cheese.  Pitiful.

Bill was put on the edge of the table at the same time the food was dropped off in their drive by kind of way.  No asking is this was the order, or if it looked good or ...anything.  Just tossed to food on to the table and kept on moving.  Not even the same person that took the order (they made a point of telling us this).

So for me, there are a lot of other Deli' around that are better.  This was just a mess and I am not willing to even give a second chance.  It has just been ruined."}
{"text":"Corky's is a clean, medium volume, medium to lower upper quality(food), medium service(Waite staff), very well known deli that's been in the Cleveland area(eastern suburbs) for 50+ years. I've been going here off and on for over 40 years and the quality and service was better in the past. It's a great place to eat once in a while but the cost to quality ratio is simply not in line with the year 2014. sorry. There are just too many restaurants out there today in Cleveland that do it so much better than Corky's. Other than meeting up with old friends that find this establishment more of a habit than for its service or food, I often go elsewhere now..."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Brooklyn, this is definitely a find in Cleveland. Owned and operated by the same family for 57 years, they make their own pastries, roast their own meat and pretty much make everything in house. The breads and pastry's are so good they eve supply the local casino. right off the 271 on Chagrin you have to stop in and try, grab to go or sit in the dining room. Fresh, fun, and like mom made every dish. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Great east-coast style Jewish deli. Great breakfast, deli, etc. Sit at the counter and have a coffee while you read the paper or kibbutz with friends over pastrami sandwiches and latkes. Recommended. 

Wish there was a deli this good in St. Louis."}
{"text":"Always a good meal.  Never a wait to be seated. Deli counter is great, scrumptious deserts."}
{"text":"Great Jewish deli. Excellent corned beef. They also have a fully stocked bar. Breakfast anytime. Convenient location off of I-271. Casual attire. 

I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Simple word.....delicious.

Had the overstuffed 5 with pastrami and corned beef and it was excellent. Having just got off plane it was just the pick me up I needed. Chased it down with chocolate cake from the bakery back in the hotel room. The combination put me right to a state of nirvana before falling asleep.

Only complaint would be in watching the staff fumble around a bit as another customer was trying to order a mixed drink and none of them could figure out a Bacardi and coke."}
{"text":"Went today and got carryout. For some dumb reason, a tuna melt sounded good. So I ordered one on toasted challah bread. Straight up tuna salad and American cheese (which I was actually happy about).  The tuna salad could have used some salt and pepper. It was bland. As always, employees are very friendly.  This place, based on my past dining experiences, is a solid 3 stars.  Nothing standout, nothing great, just pretty ok."}
{"text":"I had a turkey and cheese sandwich from here. The food is overpriced and I would not return. The service from the staff is okay and not very informative about their products. Overall, I would not return not worth the money."}
{"text":"Nice people work here.  The food is classic Jewish (nonkosher) deli.  The noise level is reasonable.  If you get take-out, check your order carefully before you leave, because I've found multiple errors (I order takeout every week.)"}
{"text":"It's a deli...keep that in mind.  You're not coming here for ambiance, atmosphere, or great service.  But they serve one of the best warm corned beef/pastrami sandwich I've ever tasted.  You won't walk away hungry because these sandwiches are overstuffed."}
{"text":"Whoa mama. Just a good local deli serving good local sandwiches to die for. I mean look at the pictures. They are not afraid to give you some meats. 

First time eating here while in Cleveland on business and I was truly satisfied. In and out and it was delicious. 

This is one of those places that the locals know about but don't tell others about. 

Keep it up. I will be back."}
{"text":"During a visit to Cleveland the family and I decided to check this place out. It is located in a strip mall and appears to be a little divey, but don't let that stop you. Immediately upon entering you are blow away by the pastry and deli meat counter.

You can tell that this place is a Cleveland Institution just by the amount of older people either enjoying a meal or just hanging out and catching up with their friends. Most of the wait staff even knew them by name.

My wife and I both went with the # 4 (Hot Corned Beef, Swiss Cheese) sandwich and our daughter got a burger. The sandwiches are so big you could easily share one between two people but, my wife and I aren't the sharing type. LOL!

The corned beef was moist, flavorful, and piled high in between the two pieces of bread. My sandwich was decent but, not all that they were hyped up to be. Something was missing but, I can't put my finger on it. The pickle really made the sandwich that much better though. 

Our waitress was very good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful every time I go.  There was a tiny bit of a wait to sit down, but went rather quick.  I had the hot corned beef sandwich which is so big, and juicy.  With a little mustard it's perfect.  They give you pickles for the table which is wonderful, and so so so tasty!

If you're in Cleveland area, and want a real Jewish deli, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Fake mashed potatoes?  Are you kidding me?  I had the Hungarian style peppers with mashed potatoes. Not only were they instant potatoes there was no flavor except the fake flavor. No salt, nothing. This was my first time at Corky and Lenny's and most likely my last. I've heard several people who brag about how good this place was I just don't see how.
If I ever return I will certainly get something different that does not include mashed potatos."}
{"text":"Our go-to deli (although , sometimes to JACK'S in Cleveland Heights - also excellent) and always very happy with their CB sandwiches and soups.  The servers are experienced and efficient.  The deli counter for carry-out always gets the order spot on, and always fresh, hot (or cold as the case may be) and yummy.  My personal favorite is their Corned Beef Quesadilla - It is to DIE FOR!!   Ask for Kenny and give him a friendly Hello!  He is one of the owners, and has a terrific smile!!"}
{"text":"Used to love to come here as a CWRU student, with my suitemates, my dad and a girlfriend. I called them about a month ago & they seem to still have the same friendly service."}
{"text":"We just stumbled upon this place and we were quite glad we did.  The staff was amazing and very friendly.   OMG! The food!  Hubby had Beef and Latkas Unbelievable I got the beef dip so full of flavor.  Going back to buy the best corned beef to take home.  GREAT PLACE"}
{"text":"If God was made of corned beef, this is what He would taste like.  

They probably have other meals here.  I don't care.  In Heaven, there is an endless conveyor belt of Corky and Lenny's corned beef that allows you to eat forever and never stop."}
{"text":"Corned beef hash and poached eggs for breakfast  were delicious!  Some of the best corned beef hash I've ever had!  I will definitely eat here again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Corey's and Lenny's gets a thumbs up from this former New Yorker. Here are the facts... It's a Jewish Deli. It's in a strip mall. It's one of three Corky's and Lenny's scattered throughout the Cleveland area.

Eh what more can I say? The look, the feel, the taste are all befitting of a Jewish deli. So that means it's brightly lit on the inside and kinda sterile looking, but heck, like I said it's a Jewish deli. The front of the business contains several glass counters of refrigerated food items and beverages for take-out. The rear of the business contains a full service restaurant with a wait staff for dining in.

I'm not particularly a huge fan of Jewish food. I find it kinda plain and sort of bland. But sometimes I do crave a good sandwich or a good heaping mound of meat. On the night I visited I got my heaping mound of meat in the form of hot turkey. It was good and so were the two bowls, not one bowl, of thick gravy that accompanied it. My dining companions also enjoyed their meals as well, which included chopped liver and a pastrami sandwich. Our potato pancakes were enjoyable too. Like most Jewish delis, the amount of food we received could have easily fed twice the amount of people at our table. It made me wonder how much food gets wasted on a daily basis. But I digress.

The menu is a little bit confusing. It's almost got too many items and categories listed on it. But it's misleading because a lot of the items on the menu are repeat items. For example, I think I counted the word turkey on the menu about four times. The differences are the portion sizes and the cooking method (hot or cold).

FYI, at the end of your meal, you pay at the front cash register before you leave. Did I mention it's a Jewish deli ;-)"}
{"text":"I definitely know a good Jewish deli when I see one and this is one to warm the tummy! They serve a hearty bagel not soft and squishy like Einsteins or Panera, but traditional New York Style bagels. 
I ordered one of my favorites, lox and onion omelette that was perfectly cooked and not over salted. Onions were browned and not burnt and hash browns could have been crisper. That was the only disappointment that hash browns could have been done more. Their coffee is plentiful and not too bitter or strong, just right!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! My grandparents know the owners! The food is excellent! This is definitely the best deli that I've been to!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a recent visit. I had a solo lunch and was not disappointed.

I had #12. Those who do not speak the language, this is turkey, corned beef, swiss, lettuce, tomato, and thousand island dressing on rye with a slice also in the middle separating the meat. This is the most decadent of sandwiches and you can thank me after you eat one, or one quarter of one. You should eat the whole one though because then we have a foundation of respect. I also had a small serving of potato salad, delicious. Bonus points for having all the breakfast cereals near the stocked liquor cabinet. Cleveland through and through.

I like the waitresses. My server was nice. One of the waitresses asked if I was okay after I made some facial expression of bloated anxiety. I was okay just really stuffed, no one was hurt."}
{"text":"This place was alright, but really nothing amazing. The food is average, but what really set it apart for me was the supreme lack of service. There are servers and workers buzzing around, but it took me so long to try and flag one of them down for a glass of water! And then another 10 minutes go by before I can make eye contact with someone to take my order and they're like \"let me find your server\". Ugh.

What really got me was that it wasn't even exceptionally busy. 

I had the reuben (I asked for an extra side of sauerkraut), and was charged $17!! A glass of water, a sandwich, and an extra plate of kraut for $17??? The sandwich was like $12 so how is a plate of kraut $5?? Or at least tell me how much it'll cost me so I can make a decision not to get it, then at least I'll know what I'm getting into."}
{"text":"Went to the location at casino. They over charged me. Then wouldn't issue a refund. I felt that they did something to my food. Would not recommend eating at these establishments."}
{"text":"Ta hell with the prices, this is the Jewish deli by which I judge all others.  I grew up eating here, and every time I come back to Ohio, I head in.  

The staff is colorful and the food is how it's done.  

In fact, now that I'm thinking of it Ill need to make a corky's run tomorrow.  I need tongue!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, wide selection"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!

I've been coming here for years. The corned beef and tongue is amazing. I always get deli type food here...Corned beef, pastrami, matzoh ball soup...Mmm! I tried their Borscht over Easter, and it was incredible. I've been craving it since.

I also love those pickles. 

Service is consistent, and quick, without feeling rushed. 

What always hits me when I enter the place is the vibrant energy, and the incredible food smells. I want to sit and dig in! 

The parking lot is typical for Chagrin Road locations, and it is usually challenging to find a space quickly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Cleveland, I am usually very happy here. I called ahead to see if my favorite waitress, Laurie, was there. The woman on the phone answered my question and then swiftly hung up on me. Incredibly rude, in my opinion. 
I decided to come and have my matzoh ball soup, anyway. It is incredible."}
{"text":"We ordered a pastrami sandwich, a corned beef and a combo. Service was fast. The sandwich was impressive. The taste was great. Took home a box with a half of sand which.   We also bought a pound at the deli-counter on the way out.  Overpriced at $19.00 per pound. The pastrami was extremely fat and not as good as the sandwich. I didn't watch him cut the meat. Maybe it was the end of the piece. Still one of our favorite Places.  Puts Manny's in Chicago to shame."}
{"text":"My husband ordered 1/2 lb. of \"off the bone\" turkey to go. That's supposed to be restaurant talk for real, unprocessed turkey. Unwrapped at home, I saw that instead of \"off the bone,\" it was directly off the assembly line, processed with additives, nitrates and all the bad stuff.  Tricking customers is not a very good idea. Word gets around...The hot matzo ball soup was sent home in plastic containers. Plastic containers and hot liquids are a definite no-no, if we care about our health. Google it. C & L's does have cardboard soup containers... The \"health\" salad, which is supposed to be cold slaw without mayo, was dressed in vinegar and sugar. We washed it off....Wish I could find a deli with quality."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  An honest-to-goodness Jewish Deli.  

I had the \"New York\", which was corned beef, slaw, and thousand island on rye.  Potato salad was great.  

A lot of things on the menu looked fabulous.  If I am in the area, I will be returning."}
{"text":"One word \" FANTASTIC\" try there Reuben you won't be disappointed!!!! Juicy not dry I think it's worth the 12$ I paid for it."}
{"text":"I grew up coming here. I've had memorable meals here with so many family members, friends, and other people. It's my favorite corned-beef sandwich on the planet. I love the '70s vibe inside... weird candy for sale at the register, pickles on the table, big comfy chairs, lots of old people.

The potato pancakes and corned beef sandwich is how to do it. Not living in Cleveland, every couple years, when I return, the prices are raised - that bothers me. But I can't lie, with the history of the place, I'll return time after time."}
{"text":"Great Jew delicatessen. The menu is huge and lots of wide open spaces for big parties. Also large deli counter were you can get food to go or deli meats and cheese. Friday night they were really busy and still got a table pretty quick. Very clean and friendly staff and the menu is like 7 pages front and back. If you are craving that old deli vibe this is the place. I got the french dip and mish mash soup and it was perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome deli food! I had the #4 breakfast platter. Of you like bagels and lox its a good selection. My boyfriend had the challah French toast and said it was amazing. I am not from Cleveland, but I will stop in every time I visit."}
{"text":"mmmm. corned beef. 

i work in a place where lunch is provided by blood money, err....i mean pharmaceutical reps, on a very regular basis. corky and lenny's is brought in pretty often.

it's not my favorite but it's decent for what it is. the sandwiches are huge with more meat than anyone really needs. 

they have really good pickles that are made on-site (supposedly). they're strange in that they do not have much of a briney flavor. i love dill pickles and i'm surprised that i actually like these. they're almost bland. but still, they're just... good. hard to explain i guess. 

their side dishes are just like most deli sides. nothing special and most of them creep me out."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for years and came in expecting an East coast quality Jewish deli. I was very disappointed with both the quality of the food and the service. The corned beef was dry, the pastrami was cut too thick and over salted, the tuna salad was bland, and the latkes tasted like they were frozen then fried. All and all, the experience was lackluster and not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Closed a few hours early due to the \"extreme cold and snow\". Everyone else on the block is open!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast joint on our way out of Cleveland and this place had good reviews. The place is LOUD and the stations where they dump they dishes after a customer leaves is right there in the open. The food was okay. Pancakes were nothing to write home about. I guess you might have to go with the popular corned beef in order to give this place 5 stars. I wasn't feeling it."}
{"text":"Now this is Jewish comfort food at its finest! They are serving outstanding food for over 60 years. The staff is friendly the menu has all the classics from matzo ball soup to over stuffed corned beef to delicious smoked fish. If you do not have time to sit and enjoy a meal they do have a deli counter for quick service. 

To start we had their gigantic matzoh ball soup. The broth was very robust and the matzoh ball was super tender. My wife tried their smoked white fish. It was tasty, flakey and just perfect.  I tried their over stuffed corned beef and pastrami reuben. It barely for in my mouth it was so large but not only was it enough for three the meat was very tender and tasty and the house made thousand island put it over the top. If your in the mood for great deli favorites this is definitely the spot."}
{"text":"This deli is just about as good as it gets. The only place that could possibly be better is Katz's in NYC, but fortunately at Corky and Lenny's you don't have to worry about losing your ticket.

I've been here twice and I will probably make it a priority to come here every time I am in Cleveland. The meats are tender, flavorful and sliced perfectly (I've had the corned beef and beef tongue) and the sides are great too. Make absolutely sure you get the pickles. They are only slightly...pickled? They taste more like cucumbers than pickles.

You can also get food to go and I believe you can get deli meats by the pound. They even have a full bar although I have yet to order a drink.

Corky and Lenny's is definitely a must-do if you are in Cleveland and appreciate a good corned beef sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped by Corky's to pick up lunch today. They were very busy, despite that, our food was ready relatively quickly. I had the matzoh ball soup, New Yorker sandwich and my wife surprised me with a Russian tea biscuit. It's been a while since I've had Corky's. I felt the soup was ok, nothing special. The corned beef was a little dry, but passable for the New Yorker. I can't help but compare all Russian tea biscuits to the standard in my head which would be Davis' Bakery.  I thought the one Corky's once again was ok, nothing special. It only made me want to go to Davis' and pick up one. So, all in all, an ok lunch, but far from special."}
{"text":"My Dad brought me here on the way back from the Cleveland airport. We both had reubens, which were HUGE and delicious. I like the feel of this place and loved how busy it was when I was in there, both in the dining area and take-out orders. The pickles they serve are great and I'm hoping to have some shipped to Georgia for my husband. Hope we will return so I can try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great for a deli outside of New York! The sandwiches are large and the corn beef is delicious! However, you have to ask for the pickles, and they seemed that they had not been quite pickled but more in the regular cucumber stage. Lots of sweets to choose from , but no black and white cookies, which was quite a shock for me to see at a deli. Overall, good place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Corky and Lenny's is one of a kind.  No-nonsense but friendly and helpful service, and top-shelf huge deli sandwiches.  I've been a fan of this place for years (since high school) but have only been there a handful of times (especially since I now live 700+ miles away).  But I made a point of stopping in on a recent visit.

Pro:  good meats, soup, huge portions, pickles no longer on the table for who knows how long.  Large beer selection.

Con:  kind of on the pricey side for sandwiches.  But they are HUGE so they're probably priced right for the portion.

I would say you're safe ordering anything from the deli counter. The corned beef on toasted white (yes, I know - I'm not a rye bread eater) was tender, but the flavor not very strong.  I prefer a stronger seasoned beef I guess.

Many may compare this to NY delis, but I like to think of it as a Cleveland place, unique and set apart from mock NY deli wannabes. 

I'm glad it's still open, doing business, and the dining room is like I remember, even though  updated.  Good job, Corky and Lenny's!"}
{"text":"If you just drove by this place you would never think it could be that GOOD!  Located in a little strip mall that never has enough parking is the start of the adventure.  

It is a little on the sensory overload when you first walk in.  There is a deli counter that can order anything from pounds of meat all the way to just a bagel.  There is also a sit down section in the back if you care to dine it.  I took it to go from the deli and had to get the famous corned beef.  It was stacked so high I had to use a fork and knife!

Great flavor and a ton of food for the good price.  Glad I found this place randomly near my hotel as I am will be returning the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Please let me know if there's a better deli in the 216 area. Everything I have tried here is incredible. Do these folks a courtesy and make sure your whole party has arrived before you try to get seated.

The special sodas, the pastrami, the matzo ball soup, the latkes, the reuben...you really should just close your eyes and point to a menu item at random. Get a side of pickles, and contemplate the fact that this place has a wide selection of beer and liquor. A+ in our opinion."}
{"text":"The very best pastrami on rye sandwiches of any deli in the country! I'm not kidding even better than Katz's deli in New York City this stuff rocks! If you want to experience pastrami done right you got to go here they leave the fat on which is the most important part of the flavor!"}
{"text":"The women work very hard and the food is great!  Love the Reuben's with any of the desserts!  I miss this place as we moved 1200 miles away.  Will always stop back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"great place to eat! the corned beef is a good as you get outside of montreal and NYC"}
{"text":"We had the stuffed sandwiches and a large bowl of cabbage soup. They were huge! My corn beef and chopped liver one was delicious. The pastrami and Swiss didn't have so much flavor but was good. We both enjoyed the cabbage soup. There's enough left over for another meal"}
{"text":"Breakfast and corned beef.  That is what Corky and Lenny's is known for.  I also love the matzo ball soup.

If ever sentenced on death row, my wife would order the Eastsider sandwich, which is a really rare roast beef sandwich with the cole slaw, etc right on the giant sandwich. 

Service is a little on the smug side, but it only gives the place character.  When you have as many regulars as Corky's does, you can hardly blame them for assuming you don't need much time with the menu."}
{"text":"Great Jewish deli located just off of I-271.  The reuben was great and the coleslaw was good.  Odd layout but unique.  Service was quick and somewhat courteous.  Definitely a place full of regulars.  When in the area, I wouldn't hesitate to come back here again."}
{"text":"Worked down the street from here in high school.  This was my staple for lunch then.  Make a point to stop in whenever possible when visiting family and friends in Cleveland.  Their stuffed CB sandwiches are the best anywhere.  I'd put them head to head with any NY deli.  Pickles!!!!  Take a Chinese Almond cookie home with you!"}
{"text":"The only legit deli in Cleveland!  The sandwiches are great.  I usually get the beef tongue in rye.  Don't forget to get some of their homemade  pickles!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Corky & Lenny's since I was young. We would also stop here for lunch on our way back home. 

My favorite lunch meat is probably Pastrami, and here they over stuff your sandwich, with LOTS of meat. And what's better than that? I know what's worse than that.. there is NOTHING worse than getting a sandwich with no meat, like at Subway. 

It's in a plaza with Trader Joes and T.J Maxx, so after you fill up on good sandwiches and soups, get your shop on.

Busy plaza  but great area, right of the highway off Chagrin Blvd."}
{"text":"Got takeout becuase the place was packed. The matzaball soup was spot on for someone who was feeling under the weather. Kinishes are delicious and very well priced."}
{"text":"Really excellent deli and cafe. We stopped in for Saturday lunch and definitely indulged. Service was quick even with a busy place. We started with a potato pancake with sour cream and apple sauce on the side. It was large with soft potato with a crispy outside. We both ordered their signature corned beef Ruebens, which came grilled with cheese and sauerkraut and thousand island on the side. The sandwiches were gigantic and were served with a small cup of potato salad. The corned beef was a bit dry but the rye bread is fantastic and overall we enjoyed our meal. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Just outstanding. Traditional Jewish style delis are disappearing, but definitely not endangered in Cleveland. You enter by walking by an abundant deli case, overstuffed ( like the sandwiches) with corned beef, pastrami, salami, potato pancakes, and all the deli you could dream. Mouth starts to water. The menu reads like a short story. So many choices. So many possibilities. We chose fish platters of smoked sable fish and smoked sturgeon. This stuff is hard to find in most cities. The restaurant bustles with activity. Food coming to the tables, conversations, and happy diners. The plates pass by our table and each one leaves me thinking: I wish I had ordered that. I am a fan. I must come back. I leave. Also overstuffed, but really happy."}
{"text":"Great traditional Deli serving very tasty food - my dad likes to take me here whenever we are visiting relatives. I usually get a Matzoh ball soup to start, and then get the platter of Corned Beef and Latkes. So delicious, so filling, and so bad for you!
I haven't tried anything else, and I feel like once you veer into more uncharted territory the quality might fall."}
{"text":"Always the best. Best deli around. I have always if in the area tried to stop. Being from Pittdburgh, it's a treat. The arugula is a must for the ride home and have more for later. They have the best Rubens."}
{"text":"Corky & Lenny's is a very good deli with all of the menu items one would expect. The wait was a bit long (the sign of a busy place, I guess) but worth it. As other people have stated, good delis are hard to come by. Well worth it if you're in the area: their food is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Try the corned beef and latke sandwich. Bring your appetite or be prepared to take some home."}
{"text":"Memories.. Have not been here in umpteen years since I moved away from the CLE.   The hot corned beef sandwich was as great as I remembered.   Would put it up against any NYC corned beef any day of the week."}
{"text":"Come hungry or leave with a meaty sandwich staring you down. 

Corky and Lenny's specializes in stacking towers of meat onto thin slices of bread. Often a toothpick in needed to keep the whole thing from toppling over by the time it reaches the table. I can only speak to the lunch experience, but every sandwich reaches the carnivores bliss point with a perfect mix of flavors. The sides are about average, but no one is there for the sides anyway."}
{"text":"Leonardo da Vinci stated that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. A home stager declutters your home so it is simpler and more sophisticated. Thus we learn that we should not add things that are unnecessary, whether it be writing a term paper, decorating a room, or preparing our food. In today's food scene pierogies are tossed on sandwiches, flowers are added to salads, and cheese rinds are simmered in soups. At times such new ingredients do add a new desirable flavor or texture. Other times they just reflect the chef's desire to be seen as innovative regardless of any respect for tradition. 

What we call classic dishes became so only after talented cooks added or subtracted to the original attempts. They became classics because of wide appeal. The Jewish deli menu is one classic that owes its existence to a unique history. The Eastern European Jews borrowed from the lands where they lived but dietary laws and economics required adaptations. 

Corky and Lenny's serves heritage. Most restaurants have changed their recipes. Menus change to reflect the times with more salads, lower carbs or the fusion of new ingredients with classic recipes. The Jewish deli remains only minimally changed no matter where it is located. 

On my last visit I went with friends. We had no wait as we arrived after the dinner rush. Our server was polite, attentive and patient. He had a ready smile and was not surly as some yelpers described their servers. A deli is not known for ambiance or decor so any criticism is pointless. 

The matzo ball soup was simplicity at its best. Only a flavorful clear broth with one matzo ball that was not gigantic to impress but of the proper size to sit in the bowl as the broth's partner. The broth is not salty, dyed yellow and chemically enhanced as I found at Jack's. 

The corned beef sandwich is not the over-sized sandwich found elsewhere where I have had to remove meat in order to eat it. But an adequate pile of thinly sliced lean meat with only the flavor that identifies corned beef. This is not the corned beef of fillers, water added,  and preservatives sold by Giant Eagle for $10 a pound that one reviewer found as good as what is served at Corky and Lenny's. The rye bread was what rye sandwich bread should be. 

My friends had a Reuben and the latkes with corned beef. When we left not one plate had one crumb. We all agreed Corky and Lenny's is where to go to appreciate traditional deli fare. I recalled the many times in my life I left Corky and Lenny's knowing It will be around and I will be back. I do miss the bowls of thick half sour slices and green tomatoes that used to sit at every table."}
{"text":"It was pastrami week for me last week.  Corned beef week too, and pickles, cole slaw, potato salad, Dr. Brown's, etc.  When I'm in Cleveland I always stop in at Corky and Lenny's and I'm never disappointed.  I can't find this in Seattle, so I go for a sandwich piled high with pastrami or corned beef on rye and a couple of pickles.  Makes my day."}
{"text":"Damn Cleves, way to have a great Jewish deli all up in your 'burbs.Didn't even use the Yelp app to find this spot located next to a Starbucks. 

Hungover for the drive back to NYC, I was fortunate enough to pop up here to pick up a bacon, egg and cheese on a roll. It was a hard choice since this spot has a nice spread - bagels, cream cheeses, lox, meats, the list goes on but ultimately I went with a the staple. Not NYC fast times but about 10 minutes later my heaping mound of eggs with some bacon and cheese arrived in a white roll. Nothing legendary but, it was huge, freshly made and soaked up the booze from the night prior. It also came with a pickle, hey yoooo.

Clearly this is no Cleveland secret. The locals were here coming in for matzah ball soup, bagels and brunch so, I'd say they are doing all right here. Definitely a solid spot. The tribe knows what they're doing."}
{"text":"When you first walk in this place, the front end looks a little cluttered. The food display counter looks like it isn't cleaned often. Once you get in back the decor is a bit more promising. The corned beef however is excelente!! When I come here I usually get their corned beef sandwiches which are so melt in your mouth good! I've tried the matzo ball soup; its good. Other foods on the menu are kinda average, nothing spectacular. But those corned beef sandwiches!  I'm getting hungry just writing this, and I had a huge dinner yesterday, lol! The staff is friendly, the desserts are good. I'm rating Corky and Lenny's 3 stars because the entrance isn't that well put together, and at times the front end looks a little bit dirty. But don't let ANY of that deter you from trying the corned beef! 

This is one spot that you have to try if you are ever near the East side of Cleveland if only for the corned beef sandwiches and matzo ball soup. In fact, ONLY for the corned beef sandwiches. You won't regret it. I think I'll get one for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Corky and Lenny's is an East Side Jewish Deli institution.  I first ate here during the summer of 1977 (mostly with Dore and Miriam) and it's small consequence that I don't get the bucket of pickles.  Here in Northern California, Saul's is small compensation.  Do they serve pastrami on white bread with mayo here?  Just kidding."}
{"text":"Both my friend and I though the service was very good and the food was even better! I ordered the Mish-Mash soup with no rice and 1 stuffed cabbage. My friend got the Mish-Mash soup also. It was very good and was exactly what we were hoping for. We'll return again - this time to hopefully try the Challah French toast!"}
{"text":"This place is known for its Jewish food and boy do they do it right here!
I love their soup, corned beef, cookies and everything in between. The place is a bit busy at times but the wait is worth it. The staff is friendly and the food comes out quick. It's nothing fancy but if you are hungry this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible here. Sat for 10 minutes waiting for a server. Finally got our drink order in and it took another 10 minutest to get our drinks. It was 25 minutes before we were able to place our food order. This is unacceptable for a deli. Had the Philadelphian sandwich and it was okay. Nothing amazing about it. We won't be coming back based on the terrible service."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  It has been in business for years, albeit in another location.  This Chagrin location is easy to find in a small strip mall with Whole Foods on one end. It is just off 271, near TJMaxx,  and is super convenient for a drop in.  Service is smooth and quick.

The menu is home cooking for sure.  Amazing soups and yes, the matzoballs are tasty.  They know their chicken soup.  

Loads of wonderful sanwiches that are so large you can share, if you have a fairly normal appetite.  They have lovely entrees, all sorts of choices from blintzes to chicken to chopped liver. They have their own bakery so the great stuff is right out there to see.  

You will never walk away hungry.  You will feel like you stepped into the past with wait staff that actually talk to you and try to make your life a happy one for the short time you are with them.  Their dill pickles are the real thing.  Breakfasts are amazing.   

Did I say I love this place?  Great bang for the buck and great service."}
{"text":"I would venture to say Corky & Lenny's is the best deli in OH.  My family has been coming to this location since before I was born.  Usually, we get their sandwiches straight from the deli to enjoy at home.  This past time, we decided to dine in.

Unfortunately, the hostess seemed less than capable.  I'm not sure if she is new or what, but there were a ton open seats in the front and she sat us, a group of 6, in the middle of all the booths that were totally filled. People kept on running into our table and space was limited.

Our server, Max, was great.  None of our waters or pops were ever half empty.  He kept us hydrated the whole time and made sure we always had pickles on our table!

The food. Corned beef.  Pastrami. Slaw. If I could afford the calories, I would eat at Corky & Lenny's every time I was I'm in town.  You just can't beat their corned beef!  They do it the right way!  I had the Sammy Kay with corned beef and pastrami with thousand island dressing.  Corned beef and pastrami on rye bread.  Yes, please!"}
{"text":"Most disappointing meal of the decade: a take out lunch at Corky and Lenny deli. What the hell was that?!
You order a bowl of borscht and they give you a jar of Manischewitz abominable borscht (ingredients: water, beers, sugar, salt). Seriously?!That's what passes for a quality Jewish/Eastern European deli these days?! Kreplach didn't have a trace of taste (salt, pepper, anything?!), the dough must have been made at a galoshes factory-leathery and thick, matzo ball could be used as a weapon and made out of lead. Huge, undercooked and tasteless instead of small, feathery and irresistibly delicious. The only semi-saving grace was an order of blintzes but by the time you get to it you are seething with disgust and disbelief.This was crap and fraud. Pure and simple. Not going back. 
 
PSA:
Real borscht recipe

Beef hind shank (optional)
3 medium beets (peeled) 
1 onion (diced) 
5-6 tomatoes (diced)
1/2 cup of celery (diced) 
1.5 or more cup of carrots (diced) 
2-3 medium potatoes (peeled and cubed)-optional
Small to medium white cabbage, sliced 
Generous portion of dill 1/3 of a cup (diced) 
1 can of tomato sauce 
1 skinny can of tomato paste 
Salt or chicken bouillion cubes to taste 
1/2 lemon (squeeze and leave in the pot) 
Sugar to create some sweetness 
Sour cream  

Peel and add beets (whole) to the big pot (2/3 of water). Follow with onions, celery, carrots, potatoes, salt or chicken bouillion cubes, cabbage, lemon, tomato sauce and paste, dill, lemon. Take out cooked beets and cut them in thin strips. Return to the pot. Squeeze lemon and add to the pot (keep the lemon in the pot for no more than 1 day). Add sugar (2-4 tbsp) to create just the right combination of salty, sour and sweet flavor. 

Serve with 1 tsp of sour cream per bowl. 
Toast black (rye) bread, take 1/2 clove of garlic, dunk it in salt and grate it on the sides of the bread. 
Cooking time-1 hour."}
{"text":"Breakfast was a solid three stars for me--but something tells me this would be a 4-5 star review if I would have come for lunch or dinner. 

My personal stand-outs that I tried were the bagel and the corned beef hash. That hash was perfection. I'm not really sure if I've ever had better... and that with an egg and rye toast probably would have been the most epic experience, ever. The coffee was also pretty damn good diner joe. I had the jitters from 1.5 mugs. My western omelet was good, but pretty average. 

The menu is huge, but most of it is lunch and dinner. The staff is nice. If I lived closer I'd probably be here more often, but I am determined to come back to try it for lunch. 

Until then, it's still bookmarked!"}
{"text":"Been going here for over 40 years and am a little disappointed with this visit because they want to charge for everything, .50 for tomato, $2.25 for cole slaw or potato salad which used to come with the sandwich, please. No more pickles on the table, you want them they will bring them for free, one pickle."}
{"text":"I've been going to Corky's since I was just a few months old. It's a great place to go if you like a good Jewish deli. The food is always good, the service is friendly, and despite the long lines they sit you quickly. The only complaint is the price of food, which has risen quite a bit over the past decade."}
{"text":"This is not only a great restaurant but a place of fond memories for me. This has been around for some time and if you go to this location you may meet the owner, a nice lady who will chat with you about the history if has some spare moments.

Great Jewish deli food, where to start. Get corn beef and latkas, with matzo ball soup, just doesn't get any better than that. Ask for a side of pickles for the table and then get some of the coconut cake or cookies from the bakery area for dessert. 

100% Cleveland staple, great place to bring family and friends."}
{"text":"We heard alot about this place when we first moved here, and were very excited to go, only to be really disappointed. There were buckets of pickles on the tables, only they weren't brought out fresh for every customer, they were just left out all day to get warm and rubbery, plus who knows how long they had been out, and how many other people had sat at that table since.

The food was nothing special. My sandwich was room temperature, not warm or cold, and my friend got a reuben quesadilla which was also not warm or cold, just room temp with congealed cheese.

Shortly after this bad experience, they had a salmonella outbreak and were closed for a week. 

I've heard from other people that this place was amazing maybe 10 years ago, and people still visit out of nostalgia, but if it's your first time you might want to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm always tempted to go to Corky & Lenny's when I'm in the Chagrin Boulevard area.  I've loved those huge corned beef sandwiches since I was a kid, when it would be a real treat to make the trip to the east side to eat.  I haven't tried some of the other big names in Cleveland corned beef (i.e., Slyman's), so I'll reserve judgment on any \"best\" tags.  I'll just say that the corned beef sandwiches here are excellent and miles above what you would probably get at an average corned beef sandwich place.

I haven't had much else on the menu besides the corned beef.  The potato salad is pretty good and the matzo ball soup was okay.  Just having chocolate phosphates available is a plus, and I'll take Corky & Lenny's chocolate phosphate over Alvie's (who I don't think even serves them anymore) any day of the week.

I wanted to give Corky & Lenny's four stars (admittedly, this isn't the \"fine dining\" scale), but I dropped it down to three based on service and the overall appearance of the restaurant.  Granted, it's a deli, but I think service could be a little quicker and friendlier, and the restaurant could be a little cleaner.  Some might say that this adds to the character of the eatery, but there is plenty of room for improvement that won't at all change the deli-nature of the restaurant."}
{"text":"My corned beef sandwich (about $12) was plentifully stacked with a tiny side of potato salad...ie, it was very good but nothing special...served on a white plate; pretty basic. We were seated (there were five of us) in a booth adjacent to the restrooms, outside of which were cleaning materials, packing containers, etc, so I asked one of my friends to change places so I wouldn't have the view. Tasty dill pickles (complimentary); decent coffee; pleasant service.  All fine, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Good Old Fashioned Jewish deli in Beachwood? It actually makes sense - but you'd have to visist to understand.. Half sour pickles and tomatoes wait for you as you sit down...My cousin was adamant that this place had the best corn beef - i took his word for it since i'm not a fan but i did have a bagel w/ lox and cream cheese... it was good - the fish seemed fresh, and all my cousins liked their corn beef sandwiches."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Cleveland and was looking for an authentic deli. Look no further! We love Corky and Lenny's! The restaurant is inviting and the staff is attentive. I've never had to wait for a table. The options for food seem endless and pricing is very appropriate. I bring friends and family to this location because I'm proud I've found my new favorite deli."}
{"text":"Delicious corned beef on Rye.  The best I have had in a very long time!  I went back the next day to take a friend and get another one.  The homemade pickles were also amazing!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but it fell flat.  I've been twice now and both times the service was good.  Kudos to our recent server, Chad who was very kind and helpful.  He checked in on us and made sure our glasses were always full.  He made our experience pleasant.

The food on the other hand was sub-par.  The french fries were fresh but weren't salted.  The matzoh ball soup was decently sized, but the matzoh ball itself lacked seasoning and I only had two pieces of carrot in my soup.  The broth was just average, not terribly rich or complex.

The sandwiches are large, as promised.  The Pastrami Reuben and the corned beef sandwiched were good.  The meat is always better warm.  When I had it cold, the sandwich was just too dry.  The sauerkraut helped a bit and was decently seasoned and a good condiment.  The Tuna melt tasted homemade, but again, lacked seasoning and was a little dry.  A little dijon mustard helped on both accounts. 

If you're looking for a quick lunch and decent service, I recommend this place.  Otherwise, I suggest you find an alternative deli for more flavorful food."}
{"text":"East side institution, and in my 13 years of living here, I had yet to visit.  Decided to give it a try for lunch, and was happy I did.

Ordered the corned beef Reuben (I consider it a standard sandwich for a deli), and was impressed.  Tasty, and the portion was just right.  The one complaint is that it is served with a side of potato salad, and while it wasn't bad, I would've liked the option to substitute french fries or home fries.  Not a biggy.

Definitely has that NYC deli feel to it, which is cool.  Also, has a larger menu than Jack's Deli, which is local competition."}
{"text":"Oh snap. I thought I would be clever and try to be the first to review this place, seeing as it's in Cleveland (a seldom Yelped location, if I do say so myself). But I see that Corky's is just too damn good for Yelpers to remain aloof.

So here's the deal. You go here, and you'll get crabby old Jewish Midwestern ladies who probably want to put their cigarettes out in your matzo balls. Enjoy it. The tude is what makes this place unique. Your food will always arrive swiftly and score a 10 on the flavor scale. 

What to get at this legendary Jewish deli? Why, hot corned beef on rye, of course! and latkes. and matzo balls. And you better sink your fingers into the delectable tin dish of full-sour dills they put on your table before  each order. Go figure: most restaurants give you free bread; Corky's piles on the pickles. I guarantee you two things when you come here: your food will be delicious, and you will smell terrible after eating it. But why would you want it any other way? Shalom."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Writing this makes me want to get in my car and get lunch that will be enough for dinner & lunch tomorrow.

Brisket, corn beef, pastrami, etc.  HUGE portions! It is our local Carnegie Deli.  I would recommend this to anyone!

They have a small market at the entrance and a retail area at check out. If you can't be happy here, I don't know what to tell you."}
{"text":"I was in the Cleveland area for a couple months this year for work.  I quickly found C&L's and I went there at least once a week.  I grew-up in New York, but have been in Boston for almost 20 years.  Boston is a great city, but the Deli's suck!  C&L's totally made me feel at home.

The corned beef and pastrami are amazing.  Love the Matzos ball soup and oftentimes had the Chicken Salad sandwich.  A cool try are the Sour Kraut balls (like little reubens) with bits of corned beef.

Go to Corky and Lenny's and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for 25+ years and I don't think there are very many times I didn't have their Beef & Latkes. It's a corned beef sandwich and uses latkes instead of bread. Genius. Delicious. I live in California, but when I'm visiting family I always go out for Corky & Lenny's. Today it was especially good."}
{"text":"We often stay on this side of town when we're in the Cleveland area, and we usually try to hit Corky & Lenny's at least once for breakfast or lunch.
I like the vibe here...lots of regulars and its usually a cheerfully packed house.
Mish mosh soup, the bagel dinner rolls, corned beef hash are among my favorites. This last trip, I had the daily special-a huge plate of chicken paprikash...tasty and more than enough for lunch and dinner (lots of leftovers, so fortunately I have a fridge and a microwave in my room this trip!).
Service is usually fast and attentive. We only get here once or twice a year, but I remember seeing many of the servers from prior trips. And I definitely remember the cashier lady someone else here described as the woman with the Harry Carey glasses!
Today, we had Micky (a little Oriental lady with a big cap and a big smile who I know has been a server here for quite a while). We were seated in Micky's section near a couple of tables of regulars, and she made us feel like one of the treasured regulars as well-joking with us and tucking a couple of extra bagel dinner rolls into our basket when my dining companion looked longingly as she told me they'd come with my entree (he was having a massive corned beef sandwich, but she saw his face and brought the extra rolls for him. You won't go hungry in this place, f'sure.
The woman at the register when I checked out made sure I had a bag and extra napkins for the leftovers I was taking home as she cashed me out and wished me a healthy and happy New Year.
There is a reasonable-sized meat/deli counter in front of the store, along with a small shop for snacks, etc. by the cash register. I've been able to pick up things like bottles of Cleveland ball park mustard here."}
{"text":"My favorite Jewish deli in Cleveland! The corned beef Rueben is the best, I get it every time. Get the matzo ball soup, the broth is ridiculously good. We always smoked white fish, sable, and chopped liver but honestly you can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"I eat here often when home, usually get the Corned Beef, Nova Lox, and Mish Mash. Very nice Kosher Deli appeal, can get very busy at times during lunch and early bird hours. Very good food to hit the spot. You will go home full for sure .

A Kosher mainstay in the Cleveland area, they got a lot of nice choices for all. I really want to try their breakfast one day, looks good as well."}
{"text":"With all due respect to people that love this place, I've never loved this place. I am unbiased. I'm born and raised CLE and have lived north, south, west, east, down in Columbus and on the east coast for 6 years. I've visited Corky and Lenny's a handful of times in the last 25 years and have never loved this place. Besides the high prices, their food is just not that great. Especially their corned beef. I've never been able to figure out why people love this place, unless it's the nostalgia? It's ok but their corn beef  comes from the same vendor that so many other places in CLE buy from.  Oh! and after you eat outside of CLE at a similar deli (and we're not talking NY city here!), you'll see there is absolutely no comparison.  The only item that I'd order from here if I still lived in Beachwood, or was in the area, is the matzo ball/kreplach soup, but I'd get it to go.

Those that know me know that I give an unbiased opinion.  I worked in restaurants for years back in my college days. It's a tough business, however, in order to survive restaurants have to continually adapt and cater to the customer first. Corky's is merely ok, but with rising food prices, service and competition,  they need to do better."}
{"text":"This place has a great product, one that will keep you coming back but the service is slow and unfriendly. I feel almost each time I come in, the people that work there either make me feel like I hadn't or that I'm disrupting their time. Great food but a smile would make me feel more comfortable."}
{"text":"The Corned beef Reuben was the best sandwhich I've ever had in my life.  The meat melted in my mouth it was so buttery.  Never had anything like that.
Also, loved the devoted customers.  It was very family in there. A lot of friendly older generation people that seemed very comfortable there.
Great vibes
and Great pickles too"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years the food is great however the customer service is very very bad The corn beef sandwiches excellent The desserts are excellent as well this location is also very clean and is usually very busy"}
{"text":"LISTEN HERE PEOPLE: THIS IS THE BEST CORNED BEEF I HAVE EVER HAD, AND THIS IS COMING FROM A CORNED BEEF FANATIC!!!! It was so warm and moist and juicy. I was visiting from out of town for a funeral. I found out my friend who had passed worked here so it was a bit sentimental! I came here twice because it was so good. I need to make a special trip out to cleveland again for this delicacy!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT. 
I love splitting half a pastrami, cup of matzo ball soup and eating a ton of pickles !
This place ROCKS!
We always come here when we visit from out of town."}
{"text":"It seems that this place does the least amount as possible to make a plate complete. The salad, it was bagged iceberg mix with 2 pieces of tomato and cucumber with sliced up meat and cheese. 13$. That my friends is the bare minimum. Side of veggies, you guessed it, steamed with no seasoning. I really think this place is living on past reputation, just visit Joe's by Rocky River.

The sandwiches are decent, but the just  the bare minimum."}
{"text":"This place is pretty packed at lunch, but we still managed to get seated pretty quickly.

I went with the hot pastrami and corned beef combination sandwich, which came with a side of cole slaw. I can't really complain about the sandwich, overstuffed several inches high with meat. But the cole slaw was pretty terrible, and I didn't really touch it after my first bite. I suppose the previous reviewers were right about sticking to the sandwiches.

Anyway, this place is located in a strip mall just off the interstate. It's not too obvious from the road, but it's on the same corner as the Whole Foods. Best of luck pushing through the traffic to find a parking space."}
{"text":"There's a lot of great food in Cleveland, and there are certainly a lot of great delis...and there is a lot of good corned beef. 

Everyone here knows the top spots. In my opinion Corky and Lenny's is top 5. It's an institution that has been around for a very long time. You can get all of your deli favorites, great service, and sometimes with a side of attitude if you like. 

Maybe I'm a little biased because this is the spot where I was introduced to the big corned beef sandwich as a kid, and returned to in high school and college with my boys when grabbing a bite after a long day. A little biased, but not much. These guys have earned their position among Cleveland's best."}
{"text":"Only been here once for breakfast. Very busy place. Breakfast was ok. Seemed like plenty of people were there for the front store. I will try it again."}
{"text":"Corned Beef. Where is the beef!!!!!???? and the price for a sandwich...oy vey"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but super pricy! I was shocked at how steep the costs are here. $2 for a can of pop! $11 for lox bagel - no sides. I'm not sure it was entirely worth it.
However, the service was good and they had a great kosher for Passover menu for my bf. My to-go kugel was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Nice deli food and lots of it. Potato pancakes were wonderful. Matzah ball soup delicious. Corned beef pastrami and chopped liver very tasty."}
{"text":"This place feels authentic. I have been there three times now, once for breakfast, once with colleagues for lunch and then again for snack. My favorite here is the chicken salad sandwich. 
I stopped going there as two of the three times I have been there, I have had run-ins with semi-racist individuals. The first time it was another patron sitting next to me at the breakfast bar and the other time, it was the guy preparing my sandwich.
I would go there again, but not by myself."}
{"text":"I ordered the stuffed cabbage and mashed potatoes, salad, and a small bowl of mushroom barley soup, and challah. Stuffed cabbage was adequate, not flavorful. Needed seasonings other than salt. The potatoes are INSTANT potatoes and they taste like they came right out of the box, hot water was added to the flakes and served. So disappointed that this deli uses instant potatoes. The mushroom barley soup was tasty, albeit salty, and I could only eat half of the small bowl because of the salt. The challah was day old, or maybe they had grabbed a piece they were going to use to make French toast because it was dry and tasteless and the crust was hard. I had banana cream pie for dessert. There was a quarter inch of banana cream filling in the bottom and 4 inches of cream topping. I used to live in the Akron Cleveland area, grew up eating here (the original location) but moved away in the late 80s. I was excited to return to this restaurant when I came back to visit family. My family said they never need to take anyone to eat here again. The food just isn't tasty anymore. What kind of reputable restaurant uses INSTANT potatoes!"}
{"text":"Maybe one extra stare to account for the great memories of lunches here with me grandfather when I was a wee tot. At the time in South Euclid. Went back recently for a family reunion. 

No half-sours on the table? WTF? 

Breakfast was okay. Just watching the Friday morning dynamic with old guys kibbitzing and power breakfasts all around. All the while recalling my grandpa across the table, big ol corned beef in front of him, and a giant nasty cigar afterward in the new Riveria with all the windows up and AC a-blastin. Bliss!"}
{"text":"I felt as though I had died and gone back to New York City! 

The most incredible corned beef on rye-I like mine very lean and you can order it that way at this wonderful deli restaurant. We had appetizers- a meat knish (divine) and chopped liver (lovely) and of course, cherry cheesecake for dessert. Naturally, most of this food went into boxes for another meal. but we were so excited to find so much wonderful food, we couldn't resist ordering nearly everything! Service was good and we didn't feel rushed. 

We had a little trouble finding the place with our Google navigator, and it is in a very busy strip mall, so parking was a challenge, but that is the only negative. Highly recommend to anyone seeking an experience similar to a good New York deli."}
{"text":"Nothing quite like a stacked high corned beef sandwich and a bowl of Matzoh Ball soup!"}
{"text":"Real deli food is nearly impossible to find in most cities. I guess it's because it's so labor intensive and actually requires knowledge and skill; most places would rather just buy cold cuts off the Sysco truck, hire the first person who walks in and call them a \"sandwich artist.\"

Corky & Lenny's is the real Renoir. I grew up in Solon and have lived in Michigan, Georgia, upstate NY and now California. Good luck finding food like this in any of these places. 

The extensive menu here is made from scratch and you can taste it with every bite. The corned beef is otherworldly. Ask for it \"juicy\" and it arrives with a little more fat -- a special treat. You really can't miss with any of the sky-high sandwiches. 

The key to a good Jewish deli sandwich is rye bread. I don't know where Corky & Lenny's sources its bread, but it's damn good. 

The homemade dill pickles are free; you have to try them. There's even pickled green tomatoes thrown in for good measure. 

I stop here EVERY time I visit family in Cleveland. My last visit a week ago was my first in more than two years, yet I still see familiar faces as many of the employees are lifers. And most importantly, the food quality has remained high and remarkably consistent. I hope this continues. It truly is a special place offering a quality of food that's nearly impossible to find in many communities. It deserves your respect!"}
{"text":"This was always a stop on my list when I come to the Cleveland area, but I visited not long ago and was extremely disappointed.  The waitress was extremely pushy even though the place was empty.  Corned beef was very dry and tough.  The waitress left the check with my food and never returned.  I think this is one restauramt that will be taken off my list. 

Slymans here I come"}
{"text":"WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?
Generous portions of delicious food!
Not only is the food great, but so is the people watching.
I wish that I lived closer to Corky and Lenny's, I'd have a chance to eat everything on their menu. IT'S A CLEVELAND LANDMARK."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful corned beef, Reuben's, pickles and matzah soup. Definitely worth a try! Friendly wait staff, full deli and desserts"}
{"text":"Great old school Jewish deli!  Love the food and the staff."}
{"text":"Perfect. Old school breakfAst coffee etc it has been there forever and you can tell why. Good food friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm sure this locations sandwiches are a lot better than the one downtown at the horseshoe. The location downtown is destroying Corky and Lenny's name. They are not using the same quality of meats and  the sandwiches are not getting made correctly . Such a bummer I don't know why they would want to do this it should be the same everywhere"}
{"text":"The food was amazing the service on the other hand could have been better and the waitress could have had a smile on her face and maybe I wouldn't have felt like I was eating a plate full of her anger!"}
{"text":"CORNED BEEF COMA!

Flight delay = Happy BF and GF when brunch is at Corky &Lenny's!

The BF has been talking my ear off about the corned beef here and how heavenly it is.  It was an obvious decision when stranded in Cleveland for an additional 6+ hours due to a \"missing plane part\".  

This place is so unassuming, located in a strip mall.  It's a lot bigger in size then the outside lets on.  Seat yourself in the big cafeteria like room.  Service is authentic, albeit a little on the slow side.  The warmth in our waitresses smile forgave the slow service.

The menu is large and was a bit overwhelming for me, a bit out of my norm.  Not a lot of Jewish Deli's in CO.  I was in a breakfast mood and not feeling like ordering corned beef - I know, it's a sin!  Luckily the BF was ordering the corned beef sandwich so I knew I would be able to try at least a little of his.  The Challah French toast spoke to me and I did exactly what it told me, ordered it!  I needed an order of latkes, potato is all you have to say and I'm all in.  

The corned beef is, in a word, delectable.  It was moist, flavorful, and was piled high in between two scrumptious latkes.  The corned beef paired well with the all important, Stadium Mustard, a Cleveland tradition I hear.  I found myself sinking each bite of corned beef into the pool of Stadium Mustard on my plate.  I want my own squeeze bottle to pair with everything I eat, my new ketchup.  My Challah French toast was good, not nearly as memorable as the corned beef.  The corned beef in any combination should be ordered for breakfast, lunch, or dinner - no exceptions.  

*I'm kicking myself for not reading Yelp reviews sooner or I would have known to ask for pickles.  I'm a new pickle lover and needed some of these in my life.  I'm heartbroken over missing these famous pickles.  Next visit for sure."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. The best deli in Cleveland by far. Consistent quality and service. Great pickles and all the tasty usuals like matzo ball soup, kishka, corned beef and potato pancakes. This is literally the food  grew up with as a young Jew in Cleveland, so I might be a bit biased."}
{"text":"Our waitress was attentive and kind. The food was not impressive at all. I had the \"leanest\" version of their Rueben and it was very greasy and heavy. The pickles were good, however."}
{"text":"I can't seem to catch the \"this place is an institution\" wave but I've never been a great surfer.  Either way, Corky & Lenny's is the epitome of A-OK.

There is better corned beef in this city, and I'm not even talking about Slyman's.  But, if you are looking for a very authentic Jewish deli experience, this is the place to go.

It's like being in New York.  Abrupt, spotty service, authentic Jewish deli food, no real ambiance.  In a word, exactly what you expect and want.

I hate the pickles, but I realie that puts me in the minority.  There's a weird flavor about them that most people go nuts for, so if you're looking for a good pickle joint, don't let my review dissuade you.  It's a personal taste thing.

Their corned beef hash is of the mushy variety.  Some restaurants do the chunky, drier variety (Inn On Coventry for instance), and some basically just dump the can of Hormel on a flat top and make it crispy (ain't nothin' wrong with that).  Corky & Lenny's does neither.  Theirs is definitely not from a can, but it's very fine, like it was pulsed in a food processor.  But my god is it rich and delicious.  And a bagel here is legit.  It's not like a Panera bagel as fine and dandy as those are.  It's got a coarser texture to it, a thicker crust, and wonderful flavor.  

The coffee is in the bottom 25% of all restaurant coffee I've had which is almost all restaurant coffee available.  Fortunately, the coffee renaissance of the 2000s means that you have to be in the bottom 10% for it to be undrinkable.  

An easy place to make a regular stopping place, Corky & Lenny's is nothing special objectively speaking, but it is definitely an experience that I enjoy!"}
{"text":"Um, YUMMMMM!!!!!!!!!! What else can I really say?

I was craving a sandwich and asked my parents if they wanted to come here for lunch. I've never been, but have been wanting to try it for quite some time. Let's just say, it will be hard to stay away from Corky & Lenny's....

I started off with the mazto ball soup. I was generous enough to share half of it, just to ensure I'd have enough room left to enjoy my sandwich! The soup was really good; the broth was perfect, as was the texture of the matzo ball- this was no bomb by any means. Light and fluffy with just the right amount of firmness.

Next came the sandwich. My mom and I decided to split the corned beef Reuben. On my first visit, I had to order what they are known for! The sandwich was absolutely delicious. It had the perfect ratio of meat to sauerkraut, with the added touch of cheese. The dressing was served on the side, which was great since Rubens are usually drowning in it. The corned beef was some of the best I've had- not dry at all, and only a little bit of fat I had to take off. I could have easily devoured the entire thing on my own, but just the half with the soup was just enough to fill me up. 

Oh, and let's not forget the pickles. Mmmm....pickles. They were the perfect compliment to my sandwich, and I may have eaten more than my fair share requiring the need to ask for a few more so others could enjoy them!

I will be returning here for a repeat when I come back to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Bagels, corned beef hash and Challah French toast. I've been here several times based on recommendation from family. It's pretty good. They have some variety to their bagels so you won't go wrong with whatever your preferences. 
Corned Beef hash is served with a poached egg on top of a slab of shredded corned beef and hash brown. I have my egg done easy so the yolk runs deep into the meat and potatoes. Yum
Their coffee is your usual cafeteria type and kinda bland.
The morning staff are generally very pleasant, attentive and good for recommendations. I've had one encounter that was very subpar but just that one time.
Definitely, one of those must have at least once a year type places."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good memories of this place, and a recent visit lived up to my expectations. They have a huge menu, but I tend to zero in on deli favorites like matzoh ball soup, Reuben sandwiches, and latkes. Pickles are still complimentary, but now are provided just on request, and they're well worth asking for.

It's not like this place doesn't have any flaws, but it has none I care about when I'm heeding the call of the corned beef. It's a Cleveland treasure."}
{"text":"My husband grew up eating at this local institution. I did not. Therefore, I have no ties to this place or fond memories that may adversely affect this review.

With that said-I don't plan on going back here.

We've eaten here a few times over the course of the past few years when visiting his hometown and never once have I felt that I've eaten anything other than a pedestrian dish.
The waitstaff is pleasant and always very welcoming, that's pretty much where the smiles cease for me. This past time eating here was so lackluster that even my husband with his fond memories in tow complained about his omelette not being made \"with love\". He even went as far to remark that his toast was the best thing served to him there in awhile. His omelette was noticeably bland-looking and he said it was \"tasteless\" and \"drab\". I stuck with some oatmeal and a side of toast-I figured I couldn't go wrong there.

It's a sad day when you order oatmeal in an attempt to eat something that you're sure won't disappoint your tastebuds. I know oatmeal has no taste-but better to expect it up front than to be disappointed after your first bite."}
{"text":"I came here because I was roadtripping with my dad, and when I asked my brother's wife whose family is from Cleveland, what one restaurant I should hit up for a unique meal, the answer was Corky and Lenny's.  When I looked the place up on the internet on my own, and saw a photograph of a sandwich stuffed to the heavens with succulent meat, I knew that this was certainly the place to visit.

My dad was a little confused that GPS seemed to take us directly to Corky and Lenny's instead of Progressive Field, but that's just how important it was to me for us to have a good meal.  Five hours of driving, bee-lining straight for a Jewish deli four states over.

This particular location is in a pretty typical commercial shopping center, shared with like a Whole Foods and I think a TJ Maxx or something like that.  So from the exterior, it's probably easy to miss a place like this, but clearly the locals are in the know based on how busy the place was when I went, even at an odd time between lunch and dinner.

Entering the place, at first, it looks like just a deli, where you approach a counter and pick and choose from a large variety of baked goods, and pay for them at the counter, where there are tons of other sundries available for purchase.  But then you turn the corner, and it's a huge dining room that constitutes the restaurant portion of the place, and my ultimate culinary destination.  The place was well busy, but still had room for two more for my dad and I to be seated immediately.

Service was prompt and polite, and I get the impression that some of the servers have been doing this for a while, based on how familiar they seemed with other guests.  Instead of dwelling too hard on the menu, I simply pointed at the picture on the cover of the menu, a huge sandwich stuffed with turkey and corned beef, as what my dad and I both wanted (#12).

The food also came out pretty quickly, and after a long car trip, there was no hesitation to dig right on in.  The bread was flavorful, and they didn't drown the lettuce and tomato in Thousand island dressing.  And I think I've been eating poor corned beef my entire life, because Corky and Lenny's corned beef, actually tasted like, well, beef.  And not some overly salty concoction that could almost be mistaken for pastrami on a bad day.

Despite the server's playfully-mocking \"good luck\" when she brought the sandwiches, I destroyed mine without much problem.  Not to say it was no easy feat, it's just that I was hungry, and I'm a pig.  It was wonderfully delicious from first bite to last, and my mouth is watering just recollecting the experience.

Lunch for two and including a tip is easy to clear for like $30, which in my opinion isn't bad at all.  A place like Corky and Lenny's really makes me realize that there's no Jewish delis in Atlanta that come even remotely close to the similar quality, and that it looks like travel is necessary in order to even seek a good sandwich.

I can't say that I'll be back any time soon, as for odd reasons, Cleveland has been a difficult destination for me in terms of baseball park pursuits, but those who live in the area are truly lucky and privileged to have this place available."}
{"text":"Best corned beef around. Been a family tradition almost sice they opened...corned beef lean, warm rye. Stadium mustard. Uh huh! You say Katz's or Carnegie in NYC? Zingerman's in Ann Arbor? Nate-n-Al's or Factors' in LA? I say Corky and Lenny's in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I've been popping into Corky and Lenny's for better than 10 years now. They sell enormous and tasty sandwiches in a nice spot on the East Side. I particularly enjoy the hard salami sandwiches with swiss and mustard which is easily 4 inches thick. 

Homemade pickles and latkes are also worth a try!"}
{"text":"I ate here on a trip to Cleveland, ordered the combo pastrami and corned beef sandwich.  The pastrami was brown and all grizzle.  I have never been served such bad food in a restaurant, they should be ashamed of themselves for trying to take advantage of paying customers."}
{"text":"Good food but the service was slow, massive error with the bill, and the hostess was a demon queen who was anything but friendly."}
{"text":"Not the Corky's I knew as a kid.

the food is ok and the place is dated and kind of tacky.  As a kid the family used to go here often.  Now I only go if someone invites me and wans to have a business meeting.  It sure would be nice if they updated the place and adjusted to prices to reflect the value offered."}
{"text":"This place made me SO happy. They have all the Jewish deli food that I can't find in the Bay Area.
Chopped liver, sable, mish mash (matzo ball, noodles, & kreplach.)
The list goes on and on.

Prices were much more reasonable than in L.A. or NY. 
Although, the food was (mostly) just as incredible. 

Three of us shared the big bowl of mish mash. 
I had sable and a bagel . Sable is one of my favorite things, and it's impossible to find where I live.

My dad had the 3 little tootsies, (which he remembered having there 30 years ago)
My hubby had a pastrami and corned beef, (don't recall the exact name of the sandwich.)

We also tried a few different rugelach. These fell short, they were good, but not nearly as good as others I've had.

I will definitely come back if I'm in the area again.

I loved this place so much, I'm still thinking about it over a week later."}
{"text":"All I'll say is this
Gloria ( I don't care if she is an owner)
should not be in the resteraunt business
because she has terrible customer service.
She is rude & unprofessional .
If it wasn't for the food , I would never give them my $$$$."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly, terrific service.  Others have complained about poor, surly service, but I have never experienced it.  The service received today was as good as any in the area."}
{"text":"Not really sure what people mean about slow service. Stopped in for a late lunch on St. Patrick's after a long chilly drive. We were seated immediately and our waitress ( dressed in green- everyone was) came over in about a minute. The place was really busy but we got our sandwiches in  about 10 minutes and our drinks immediately. We even had dessert . My husband loved his cheesecake and I had an eclair which the waitress said was made in house. Yummy."}
{"text":"3/13/18 Had smoked white fish. Good taste, but portion too small. Wife had huge mound of salmon cream cheese on bagel. She thought it was too salty. I liked it, but wouldn't order it. Overall not our best meals there, but still love this place. 
- Rob's rating on Zomato: 4.5."}
{"text":"Good food.  Nice severs.  Nasty hostess!    It appears she has been there for years.  But that does not make it right to treat people poorly.   Been going to Corkys for years.  Her tone and attitude drove  us right out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"NYC style with NYC prices. 
First thing you notice when you leave NY, NJ, MA is the sloooow service. This isn't even south of the Mason Dixon. What's with the 5 minutes to slice half a pound of deli take out? And you want pastrami, corned beef and potato salad to go, and a pickle too, you might as well pull up a chair, you're gonna be there awhile. In most NY delis, if you're not checked out three minutes after arriving they'll be kicking you out the door. 
Yeah it's good. Kosher style with kosher prices. But too slow. I won't hurry back."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Cleveland, Corky and Lenny's was the first choice for Jewish comfort food. Since I left in 1984, each and every time I visit Cleveland, this is one of two places I try to visit. The corned beef is second to none in the US and is piled high. You can say that about nearly all of their sandwiches. Additionally, the matzo ball soup is also very good. To wrap things up, I also love their cheesecake. This is a NY style cheesecake that rivals any. So why only three stars? In those few instances where I've veered off the sandwich path to oder one of their meals, I've always been disappointed. 

So stick with the sandwiches, forget the sides (you don't get the name side for no reason) and gulp down the cheesecake and you won't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a badly needed pastrami fix, and I was not disappointed.
As usual, my sandwich was perfect. 
I was a bit disappointed that a pickle was not included though...
What's up with that??"}
{"text":"Popular east side establishment.  Corned beef sandwich, turkey reuben and matzoh ball soup was decent.   Decent sized menu.  Gets crowded at times.  They have typical desserts when you walk in.  Pricing is reasonable but not cheap."}
{"text":"My meal was overwhelmed with gravy, and was relatively bland. On the other hand, my wife was over the moon about her Corned Beef, and the matzoh ball soup was really, really tasty.  

I finished hers!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. I'm pretty sure the residents of the Cleveland area who know about this place know how amazing this place is. (Thus why my mother brought us in for our last lunch). It's a Jewish deli with freshly cut meats and cheese. Pickles galore. Everything was so fresh! I had the New Yorker which if i recall had roast beef, not a big roast beef person or even ham for that matter. I'm strictly turkey or salami but this sandwich was amazing! 

It's been a few days since my visit and it's been in the back of my head to write this review it was that amazing!"}
{"text":"What the heck happened?! Ended up here for lunch today, around 11:30. Keeping in mind my last experience, I expected this to be a tasty deli lunch experience. Ummmm jokes on me I guess. Everybody's food was SO BLAND. You know how the best food is the restaurant food that taste homemade, but honestly you know you could never compare if you actually made it at home? That is what I wanted, but did not get. ARGHHHH. 

My brisket wrap did not have any horseradish despite the menu saying it would. I choked on the meat it was so dry. And the chicken salad was mostly egg salad. IF I WANTED EGG SALAD I WOULD ORDER EGG OK?!??? The marinated mushroom was just a chewy mass. Like they just whipped it out of the bunch that they marinated and put it on some bread. Not even grilled. So disappointed!!!

I am still giving two stars because it was fresh, just not good. So learn to work with the quality and you'll be killing the deli game. 

p.s. Sauerkraut balls were good, but probably only because they were fried. They were made with mostly corn beef anyways, not sauerkraut. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been at Corky and Lenny's in years, thought we would try it as Slymans eastside did not open till 9AM (bright idea there) on Saturday.
Great service and food was hot and served quickly.  The staff at the checkout and bakery were very helpful and friendly. 
I wish the menu was a little more extensive - but hey, I'm not local."}
{"text":"I had been to this unremarkable deli once before. My first visit was so unmemorable that upon looking back I couldn't even remember what I had ordered. And to be honest, I had nearly forgotten of this establishment's existence -- a bland storefront tucked away in an even blander strip mall. 

A recent Saturday brunch craving took over me and I decided to give Corky & Lenny's another shot. 

Upon walking past the deli counter to the restaurant area, we were forced to seat ourselves, despite the \"Wait to be Seated\" sign. The hostess merely gestured to an empty table off in the distance that hadn't yet been wiped off and tiredly handed us our menus. 

We sat down and our waitress, instead of greeting us, reached over and grabbed the caddy of jams and jellies from our table and gave it to the booth behind us. Ummm hello, to you, too?

I'm not going to knock the food, because it wasn't bad. Not great, but not bad. I actually enjoyed my challah french toast. But the service! What a disaster. 

So our food had just come out and not five minutes and maybe ten bites into our meal, and the waitress puts the check on our table. I felt like she was trying to rush us out - even though there were plenty of empty tables and no one waiting. 

On top of that, she overcharged us for a side of hash browns - $3.25 instead of $2.95. The reason for this? \"You have to order eggs for the cheaper price.\" Umm where on the menu does it say this? I checked Corky & Lenny's \"Side Orders\" section on their online menu and nowhere does it mention that eggs need to be purchased to get the posted \"Side Order\" hash brown price of $2.95. Maybe this restaurant operates on \"alternative facts\"? Regardless, I can't seem to explain the discrepancy. 

I find myself wishing I had truly forgotten all about this place and saved myself the disappointment and frustration of a second visit."}
{"text":"I was glad to have a recommendation from a pal who lives in Cleveland to go to this place!  I use to live in NYC two blocks from the 2nd St. deli (which I am told is no longer there) and ate there often.

True NY jewish style deli for what I had, CORNED BEEF, piled high (I ordered the king size sandwich)  on rye.

I cant vouch for anything else they have and they have it all, knishes, smoked fish, pastrami you name it.

I'm glad I'm in town for the week cause I'll be back"}
{"text":"This is pretty much a typical deli.  The food is delicious, but the service is spotty.  I actually got the completely wrong sandwich and didn't realize until after I ate it which sounds silly.  I wanted the turkey and pastrami sandwich and just got turkey, and it was delicious, but still annoying.  I also ordered cottage fries that never came but after finishing the sandwich I didn't want them anyways.  I felt confused the whole time I was there, I don't think the food is made in the kitchen just behind the deli counter?  Really good pastries too.  I'll have to give it another try."}
{"text":"Great split pea soup and corned beef sandwich always awesome.  Make sure to get the pickles and order the fries"}
{"text":"went more than once a week as a kid. 
you have to know what to order. 
and when you do you will give it 5 stars. 
this isn't a fancy restaurant. 
its a deli. 
and its amazing."}
{"text":"Great place, but the person making the sandwich will make it a good place or a terrific place. Second time here and got the Clevelander. The girl that made it last week was hands down better then the guy who made it today. She went the extra mile, he just went through the motions."}
{"text":"You can call me un-american if you like, but to be honest I really don't like many traditional deli style restaurants.  I won't go into detail why, but I would say that certainly had impact on my experience here as well.

We stumbled upon this place - almost quite literally.  We were browsing around in the shopping plaza that it is in and basically just walked into the door because we were so hungry.  I had no idea what the place was or what kind of reviews it had (which is rare for me).  It was very crowded during lunch...no surprise there.  We sat at the bar area because it would have been significantly longer wait for a table.  

I ordered The Cevelander sandwich.  Obviously it was gigantic and it was satisfying no question.  It did not blow me away really - I felt like it was just a big sandwich.

Sitting at the bar area; however, we did not get very good service.  It was slow, and almost dismissive.  It really wasn't THAT crowded where the service should have suffered this much.  

Maybe my next experience here will be better...I mean my wife loved this place.  She was talking about it still days later.  Or maybe my deli aversion will prevail."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches with super tender and flavorful meats.  Had the half corned beef, half pastrami sandwich on rye with the ballpark mustard.  Best corned beef I've ever had!  I will definitely eat there again when I'm in the area.
Service is some of the best I've ever experienced.  Very friendly and helpful with any questions you have.

Pickles must be an acquired taste..."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a meeting and this was my first visit--almost a pilgrimage to sit at a table, get some pickles and await a corned beef sandwich as good/better than anything else available in the USA.  The formula is tried and true, the place was bustling at 2 PM in the afternoon and it did not disappoint. Go, enjoy and hope it does not change."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best deli west of the Hudson. I've been stopping at Corky & Lenny's in my travels for many years, and I always leave blissfully happy.  You can either eat in or get take-out. The menu has evolved over the years to include many, possibly too many, items, but the staples remain as wonderful as ever.  The Reuben is piled high with corned beef and very Swiss-cheesy.  One slight complaint: The beef is not as lean as it used to be - a different supplier, maybe?  The Matzo Ball Soup is a magnificent cure for whatever ails you, even a bad mood. The pickles? Don't even get me started on them. Crunchy. Fat.  The best you will ever, ever have.  A bagel with lox?  Yes, it's a bit pricey, but it comes on a deep pillow of cream cheese, a huge portion of lox, topped with (if you want) tomatoes, a big scoop of capers and a fat slice of onion.  Then we get to the bakery. Cookies the size of Cleveland.  Cream puffs.  Strudel.  Kugel.  Cream pies.  Service has always been fast and friendly.  At the deli counter, I always end up chatting with the other customers. Stay open forever, Corky & Lenny's!"}
{"text":"This place was actually closed a few years ago by the health department due to cleanliness.  We stopped patronizing Corky and Lennys and now eat at, 5th Ave Deli at SOM and Mayfield.  Much better food, cleaner and a much friendlier staff"}
{"text":"This place is always packed during lunch. Like, ridiculously packed.

My coworker took me here for lunch and we made it before the insane wait started. My chicken salad wrap was pretty good, but I'll pass on the pasta salad side next time. The most annoying part was the busboy cart constantly passing us as we were finishing our lunch. It was like Jaws was circling us waiting for us to get up. I can understand wanting to turn tables, but don't make it so obvious.

It took quite a while for us to actually pay for our meal, since the line for paying was long as well.

Like I said, the place is good. Would I wait over 10-15 minutes for a table? Not likely."}
{"text":"very good Jewish deli on Cleveland's east side with everything from beeftongue to corned beef to cheeseburgers.  I especially like the latkas and corned beef."}
{"text":"Went at lunch time. Placed an to go order via phone. Service was great. Food was so so. I enjoyed the pickle more than the sandwich. Potatoes salad was good. Sandwich wasn't as big as I expected. Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful selection.  Fresh, homemade items.  Delicious flavors.  Kind, generous staff."}
{"text":"Had a corned beef and pastrami sandwich. I could barely eat 1/2 it was so huge! Corned beef is some of the best ever. You can order to go and grab some other deli treats like blintzes. On the way out, I just noticed they sell homemade potato pancake batter and other things from the restaurant."}
{"text":"It takes a serious lack of service and quality for me to give such a negative review.  
I am not impressed at all by this place, for a few reasons.
The service was slow, slow, S L O W and the atmosphere was so noisy you couldn't hear yourself think. The general vibe given off by the staff was, \"This job sucks and I can't wait until I can leave.\"  The most cordial employee was the gentleman who brought us glasses of water.
The waitress was mediocre; we ordered our sandwiches (corned beef and roast beef) and waited thirty minutes for them (30 minutes to slap two cold sandwiches together.). The bread was unremarkable, and the corned beef had a fair amount of fat chunks in it (so you're not getting pricier extra lean meat). These sandwiches, 2 soft drinks and a little basket of potato chips were most certainly NOT worth the $30 check!  This place offers nothing that justifies the price.
Jack's deli and 5th Avenue Deli are much better quality and the prices are much better as well.   The service and food are both fantastic at these places, so much so that when you come to C&L you feel like someone took all your money and gave you an empty plate.
The icing on the proverbial cake was when we went to the counter to pay...the cashier was stand-offish and rude; I paid with my cc and when she retuned it to me she FLUNG IT ON THE COUNTER and walked away.  No greeting, no asking about the food, no thank you for dining with us.
Think before you give this place your money, as there are better delis around!
Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I have to confess something.  When I first made it down to Cleveland and started hearing about how much pride Ohioans had when it came to corned beef, it must be the state meat or something.  So I decided to try it and C & L's was my first.  You could say they stole my CB virginity and I liked it.  I was a fan from that very day and love that stuff, more of the reuben variety but regardless.   

So I went with the CB and my friend had the veggie sandwich.  She did not particularly like hers because of the 6 ounces of cream cheese they put on this thing.  After some deconstructing and reconstructing, it turned out much better.  I also tried the Matzo ball soup.  I have to say the Matzo was good but not as good as Manhattan Deli's.  The sandwich was really good but since I've traveled to places like Slyman's and Croagh Patricks for CB, my rating for C & L's has slightly dropped.

The place has huge potential for a lot of foot traffic and did the day I went, very busy.  But I think with places like B-Spot opening up, not sure if Corky's will be my first choice anymore.  I will still recommend it though, so get over there and try it, maybe I just caught them on a bad day.  They have a big menu and lots of offerings."}
{"text":"Corky & Lenny's is a favorite from my childhood and I've bragged about it in the past but there definitely are some recent blemishes to an otherwise great reputation.

First and most importantly: the corned beef.  The last couple of times I've gone it's been a bit dry.  Still good, but not great.  Additionally, the past couple of times I've ordered some derivative of a hot corned beef sandwich and the sandwich comes out lukewarm at best.

A complaint I've frequently heard is about the service.  In the past, this didn't seem too big of an issue to me but it's recently been hard to push aside.  Overall, the servers tend to be pretty aloof and at times, downright rude.  Also, orders arrive with parts of the order missing which is irritating.  

Overall, Corky & Lenny's is still a GOOD deli but I'm not sure I'd push anyone to go out of their way to stop by."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment!!  This was always the place to be and be seen. Moved from the area many years ago, but come back to visit family every year. This last visit the other day for lunch was such an awful experience. 
It seems each year the place declines a little bit more.
The servers used to be so pleasant and efficient; now you're lucky if you get a greeting and a smile, rather than a dirty look and a growl,  if you ask for something, that they forgot to bring. The food was below par. My potato pancakes were like hockey pucks. You could barely cut them with a knife and when you did,  they were undercooked inside. My husband's chopped liver was dark and mushy...later we were told it was beef liver not chicken....I don't know of any delicatessen that sells chopped beef liver  (seems sacrilegious). They used to put pickles and rolls on the table; now you have  to ask for everything and be charged for it. This is a perfect example of \"you can't go home again\". Do yourself a favor and eat at Jack's, just a few minutes away....far superior and they have kept the integrity of what a deli should be."}
{"text":"My friend David took me to lunch earlier this week, claiming Corky & Lenny's was one of the best delis in Cleveland. He was 100% correct. I ordered the Beachwood sandwich (brisket) which came with some delicious potato salad on the side. They have the infamous Cleveland Indians ballpark mustard on every table, which tasted great on the sandwich. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Old School Jewish Deli - big menu, big sandwiches but big prices. lots of seating, and a staff thats never thrilled to see you. if you have a problem with your order they will do their best to pretend to care."}
{"text":"Generous portions, fresh ingredients, superior service and amazing atmosphere make C and L the place to eat for east side foodies"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch while in town for work--- by far the worst service and most chaotic place I have ever been in. The man at the front seating guests barely looked at me when I spoke to him and when I left he was standing directly in the place of people needing to pay their bill and never once moved or said excuse me. I had to bump into another guest to get through. Then while eating my salad a bus boy came over and starting moving my table while I was mid bite to make room for others. I would have gladly moved but can you ask me first. All in all very disappointing and very expensive for what you are given."}
{"text":"First of all, I love me some deli!   Second of all, I love a dish here so much, it is the only one I have ever eaten.  So, yep, there isn't too much depth to this review.  The dish is the Challah French Toast.  The only thing that could make it better is real maple syrup (why do so many places give packets of \"breakfast syrup\" here?)  I dig their pickles too!  I need to try their Reuben, Potato Latkas, and matzo ball soup

My hubs, on the other hand, does not like this place.  He doesn't like the layout and noisiness, the always crowded parking lot, and not so great location of the stripmall.  Then again, he doesn't have a thing for delis like me.

We agree that service is straight forward.  They are busy and they are not gonna kiss your ass. But they get the job done and keep your coffee mug filled (coffee is eh, but you aren't there for their coffee).  Pricing also seems about right.  Not bargain basement, but city deli, prices.

If you like delis, definitely give them a try, but be aware that they are probably crazy busy and for good reason."}
{"text":"When I was young this place was the place to go for deli on the east side. One of the remaining original owners still ran it and was always there. Unfortunately he passed on and one of the former owners kids runs the business. He Should not be allowed to run a restaurant let alone a business. This place is a disaster and makes some places featured on Kitchen Nightmares look like fine dining establishments. In an attempt to cover up a health and sanitation violation with their fish years ago they closed to remodel and hopefully make everyone forget that they could have almost killed someone. Unfortunately after reopening nothing changed. The former sassy but good servers are gone (died or retired... they were old when I was young) the servers they have now probably could not even get a job at McDonald's. They are slow. The food is a joke. Rubbery, dry, over cooked, bland are a few words to describe it. The only reason corkys is still around is the east siders refuse to let it die. The blue hairs remember it in its hey day. Its hey day was before I was born. I'm 29 folks. Just remember that. Please do not go hear. I worry for your health if you do."}
{"text":"In the past we use to go here every other week during the summer (when my mother in law is in town) last summer we went there and were disappointed.  The size/quality of the sandwiches seemed to go down and the prices went up.  We tried again a month or so later and had the same disappointment.  We will be on the look out for a new corn beef place this coming summer."}
{"text":"Food is great service is ok!!   But they have this old ass rude ass hostess there, for the second time that has given me attitude.   The first time I keep my mouth shut. But this time I went off on her. Retire you bitch u give this great food establishment a bad concept!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch today at around 2pm. The place was pretty empty. I opted to sit at the counter as I was eating alone. My waitress came over right away and was pleasant. I said I was visiting from out of town and asked what was good. She directed me to the sandwiches page of the menu. I had The Philadelphian which was pastrami, cole slaw and thousand island dressing. I'm a born and bred New Yorker and take Pastrami seriously. My sandwich was good. I love a pastrami that is fatty but not too fatty.  Extra lean pastrami is an oxymoron to me. The only con regarding the pastrami was that it wasn't very salty.  The potato salad was good too. My server was attentive. She dropped the check off before I was finished but told me she was not rushing me in any way and I felt that she meant it. I would come back here. My only issue was really a geographic one. They had yellow mustard and stadium mustard. Apparently stadium mustard is a Cleveland thing. I like spicy NY Jewish deli mustard with lots of horseradish. I missed it on my sandwich."}
{"text":"A bit quirky and sometimes a bit slow, but we have never had a bad meal there in years! Not ever. 

When my wife did find it necessary to complain they took care of it by comping the meal and being good at business.
 
If you want to enjoy the place restaurant that is known not only around town but around the country for its food then Corky and Lenny's is the place."}
{"text":"There are just those days we're you're in need some good corned beef and latkes to make you feel happy. On those days, Corky and Lenny's is my go to. 

I have the same order every time I go there: an order of latkes, a rueben sandwich and coffee. I know, not too adventurous, but the heart wants what it wants. 

The atmosphere inside isn't super fancy, but it gets the job done. Every time I've been there's been a steady stream of customers, but my service has been fast and reliable."}
{"text":"Love Corky and Lenny's so much.  Theirs is what a pastrami sandwich should be.   The sandwiches are ENORMOUS.  Somehow I find a way to eat it all.  (I usually eat half for lunch, put the rest away, then an hour later realize I'm kidding myself and scarf the rest down).   The bread is super bread.  Somehow it doesn't get soggy even when you leave your leftovers sitting around in the fridge till the next day.  

The only thing I don't like are the pickles.  They're kind of weird and a little flavorless.  I can forgive them for that though."}
{"text":"The best Ruben I have ever had but a little over priced, I would have come a couple more times while I was staying at the hotel across the street for a couple weeks but it was too expensive. Service was alright."}
{"text":"I just had arrived in to Cleveland and it was cold and raining. I happened to be sick at the same time. I went to Corky and Lenny's and i had matzo ball soup and a great Cornbeef sandwich with cole slaw. it was really good and i enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was little and my favorite thing was always the knishes and the gravy. The only thing is that they are now so tiny. I wish the cedar store was still open"}
{"text":"Corky & Lenny's is an Eastern Cleveland institution, credibly \"New York style,\" while at the same time being \"Cleveland style.\"  Tomato and lettuce on a corned beef sandwich might loose some style-points in Manhattan, but at C&L's it's simply part of the experience.  Their sandwiches are very large (not huge), contain a good quality of meat and are, at $9-11, fairly priced.  Most offer cheese as either part of the sandwich combo or as an option; another localism.

Authentic to the style, C&L's offers deli-style smoked fish, and their smoked whitefish is often what drew me here (or to the now-defunct Cedar Rd. location) during my college years.  Their chicken in a pot is decent, as well.

Service has that true-to-form grumpy exterior/soft heart which has become an icon of New York delis.  Make the effort to connect in a genuine way and you'll find warmth and personality."}
{"text":"Not a good experience tonight.  The waitress charged us for a fountain drink we did not get.  I got water, my husband got ice tea.  We asked her to take the fountain drink off and she brought the bill back with a charge for 2 ice teas.  The teas are small, and she brought another for my husband when we were almost done, and he still had tea, which we did not ask for.  Besides, I never heard of anyone charging for refills.

 So when she brought the bill the second time she had 2 teas now instead of 1.  I did not see it until we were walking to the front.  I told the cashier, and she called the waitress twice, as she never came up.  The manager came over, was nice, took it off....gave me a ten percent coupon.....told me to take it off this order.  The cashier, did not take it off the order, told me to use it next time. I said no, I want to use it this time.  She got huffy....thought she had to redo the whole bill, she only needed to apply it, 3 seconds.....
Really.....their wait staff is never great....pretty rude generally, but really.....not sure I want to go back for more of this.....Been going there 40 some years....."}
{"text":"I for one did not expect to enjoy Corky and Lenny's as much as I did -- by far, one of the best places on the East Side for any time of day. 

My boyfriend and I heard about it from various friends, and decided that we should try it. Typical for both of us, we wanted to try a little bit of everything. The first time that we went, and the second time we went, we got the same things, however, they were still as delicious as the first time. This review will mix both visits. 

The concept is simple, you walk up and wait in line to be seated. We first went on a Tuesday, and we did not have to wait as long, and the second time we went was on a Saturday, and we waited maybe 5 minutes. The restaurant is a very decent size, and the staff is nonstop working. When we got there, we were immediately greeted and people were always working with a smile. 

Once we got seated, we had to go through a very extensive menu. They have everything a typical Jewish Deli would have, plus more. Being anemic, I am always looking for a good burger, and I think I have found one of my favorites. I really don't like \"fancy\" burgers with a million toppings, but I do look for good flavor in the burger, which this by far has. Their fries were crispy, but their macaroni salad was amazing. I am always looking for an amazing macaroni salad, and this by far exceeded my expectations. My boyfriend who isn't the biggest fan of macaroni salad loved it as well. 

My boyfriend started with the \"mishmash\" soup which is a mix of noodles, rice, a meat dumpling, and of course Matzo Ball. This is more than enough for one person for a meal, so for both of us, this was a great starter. The broth was so flavorful, but still not overpowering or too salty. My favorite had to be the meat dumpling followed up by the matzo ball. He then got a Ruben, which is apparently the most popular menu item. I don't like corn beef, so I didn't try it, but he said \"5/5 - would recommend\". 

Finally, dessert -- I cannot stress how wonderful the desserts were. THe first time we went, we got an eclair and the second time a cream puff. They both are MASSIVE. Most definitely for two people. Sadly, I could not have a lot of either, but of what I tasted, it was one of the best fillings I have had of either. Again, would recommend. 

Lastly, the service. I would compare this service to something I would receive at a high end restaurant. Highly knowledgeable staff, everybody working with a smile, and just over all good service. I never had to ask for my drink to be refilled, did not feel that I was being rushed, and when something was not going as planned (for example, the dessert took a bit longer to come out, even though it was not a problem) the sever (Chad) apologized to us! It was not their fault, but they still took the time to make sure we understood what was going on. 

5/5 would recommend to anybody wanting a good place for any meal. Perfect meal every time."}
{"text":"The food here is great if you know what to get.  First and foremost, Corky's is a deli, so don't expect to have a great steak or anything too fancy.  Stick with the deli sandwiches (corned beef, pastrami, turkey, etc.), the breakfast fare or, my personal favorite, beef and latkes, and everything should be enjoyable.  To drink, I highly recommend the chocolate phosphate or a simple cup of coffee.  Corky's used to have a reputation for having really crotchety waitresses, but it seems they've mellowed out as the original waitresses from the Cedar Center location have either died off or quit.  Before you leave, make sure to snag a halvah, bottle of great soda or jar of pickles across from the cash register."}
{"text":"Oh how my memories were fulfilled by eating at Corky and Lenny's. Although it has been 45 years, all was the same. Mrs. Corky still the gem that she has always been. She shared the menu with me to overnight to AZ so I can eat like a queen at home. My tongue sandwich on rye bread melted like butter in my mouth. Couldn't stop at that, also got the chopped liver. Oh boy, nothing even close at an Arizona deli. Words can't describe!"}
{"text":"This is the deli of my youth and thus the one I compare all delis to. It's tough though because when I come home for a visit it's typically during major (usually Jewish holidays) so the entire world is there waiting. Salivating for their matzo ball soup and corned beef sandwich.

If you dare to brave the lines (or are lucky enough to live in the area) then I would highly recommend a few of their traditional menu items - the matzo ball soup, the corned beef and latkes, the blintzes or the matzo brie. Make sure to grab some treats from the bakery (russian tea biscuits or black and white cookies) before you hit the road."}
{"text":"We come to Corky and Lenny's every time we visit Cleveland.  Miss D. compares the Modern-ish decor to a Vegas buffet.  Waitresses and hostesses, backed up by a prompt kitchen staff, combine a knowing, \"take charge\" attitude with efficiency.    

You can't go wrong with lean corned beef with yellow mustard on rye, regular size.   If you eat lunch at noon, you won't be hungry until 7:30 p.m.  Ask for it \"lean.\"   If you go for the king-sized corned beef sandwich for lunch, you're done eating for the day.  

Miss D. favors the corned beef Reuben, also on rye, toasted, with sauerkraut and melted swiss.  She rated hers an \"A+.\"  Her chicken noodle soup (chicken broth only) likewise was excellent.   One time in the past she ordered goulash she wasn't crazy about.  Stick with the core items.

The staff no longer leaves buckets full of pickles at the tables, probably for health reasons.  Fine with us.  They bring each table its own small chilled tray of pickles, which they re-fill. The deli counter displays appetizing cold cuts and cheeses, plus they have coolers of beverages and other needed goodies.

{"text":"Just a cool little deli.  We stopped in for breakfast.  Seems like a nice family owned/run restaurant.  Wait staff was very nice.

Challah French Toast and Pancakes.  Excellent.

We couldn't pass up the cookies on the way out.  Sugar cookie, homemade rugulah, and a almond cookie with a big piece of chocolate in the middle.  They all were excellent.  The homemade rugulah could be the best since my grandma's."}
{"text":"Solidly ok. The highlight is the service - efficient, friendly, and accommodating. Prices are also reasonable. Some menu items are quite good (mish mash soup) while others aren't anything special (for example: basic ingredients not top grade, many sandwiches have too high ratio of meat to other ingredients). Not the best deli in the world, but won't wholly disappoint."}
{"text":"Well, not much has changed since my first visit to Corky & Lenny's about a year ago. This time, probably due to the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, the place was packed when we arrived for a quick dinner, and we were lucky to get a booth for the five of us without waiting.

Everyone else ordered the exact same thing as last time (matzo ball soup or mish mash soup), but I decided that an egg white omelet with mushrooms was the way to go this time. It was a totally acceptable, typical diner omelet, mushrooms sauteed well and wrapped within the omelet. I spruced it up with the hot sauce that our server brought over upon request. I do enjoy the pickles they bring to the table, especially the pickled tomatoes. Water refills were a bit hard to come by, but it was still packed when we left so perhaps they were just a bit too busy."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying, there are few things I enjoy more than a good pastrami sandwich. After hearing friends hype Corky and Lenny's for the longest time I found myself hungry and in the area. My girlfriend and I ordered a couple of sandwiches to go (I got the pastrami). They were busy, but it seemed like we waited forever. The service was certainly nothing to note. When we got home, I was beyond excited to tear into my meal. I was left very unsatisfied. To me, the pastrami was dry and flavorless. There was nothing really good about the sandwich. I had been told that Corky and Lenny's is on par with Slyman's... they are not. Slyman's is far superior. There are much better option in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. Owners rude and don't care. Very dirty restaurant. I know this place has been around for years but no way near what it used to be. I will never go back. Sad because used to be so great."}
{"text":"This is one of Cleveland's best delis. You can order either overstuffed sandwiches or regular sandwiches. I like that at lunch time they offer a half soup and half sandwich special. I tried the matzo ball soup and the corned beef on rye. Both were delicious.
I learned that their cheesecake is homemade so I tried a slice of strawberry covered cheesecake. It was a nice size and very filling. I thought that was the best part of the meal.

Along with the restaurant they offer take out as well as various meats, side dishes, as well as baked breads and pastries.

The only downside was having to wait too long between courses. I would imagine that it is because they are always crowded. It's the next best thing to eating in New York."}
{"text":"Looking on Yelp for a place for dinner close by, I found this place.
There were quite a bit of different options to chose from, and I really want the breakfast wrap, but I decided I'd come back some morning for that, so I tried the fried shrimp this time.
The chocolate shake sounded too good to pass up also :-)
The shrimp were tender with the breading just the right amount of crunchy.  The baked potato was hot and flaky, just the way I like it.
Staff were what you'd normally expect in a diner.  Took care of my needs, but seemed to be a little bit rushed.
Yeah, I'll be back for that breakfast wrap."}
{"text":"I ate here after flying into Hopkins and driving down to the Beachwood/Bedford/Twinsburg area for business . . . I was mighty hungry and had a lot of work to do that day, too. The pastrami with cream cheese was, oddly enough, one of the very best sandwiches I've ever had and the service was prompt, the prices more than fair. I actually use Corky & Lenny's as my yardstick for quality of other delis and they've never been bettered by anyone else thus far, even in NYC itself. 

Also, I have to say everyone I encountered in this part of Ohio was very friendly and helpful, from the hotel to this deli to a small soccer store I stopped in . . . everyone was just very nice and coming from the South, I have pretty high standards of customer service. Turns out, we Southerners despite stereotypes have nothing on the friendly folk of Ohio."}
{"text":"Corky and Lenny's is a great sandwich place that has take out and deli options for mini market type fare. You can order and take away or sit at a table for service. The sandwiches are huge and the pickles are to die for. This place isn't fancy and service can be rushed and curt but prices are fair and deli meats are great."}
{"text":"One of the stand-outs from my days in Cleveland. 
Solid deli food, friendly experience and unreal blintzes. They were both my first forray into blintzes and the exclusive constituents of my blintz experience for at least 3 years so they've effectively set the bar, and set it high they have. 
Sandwiches are monstrous, a Great Lakes variation on Katz's.  Corned beef is the best in thieveland far and away and likely the best between New York and Chicago.
 If you're on the east side, this is The definitive deli."}
{"text":"I've been going to Corky's my entire life. I love the matzo ball soup, tuna melt, hot turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy, and of course the pickles. This is where I go for comfort food!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best deli's I've been too.  My husband and I both went classic Corned Beef and I was amazed at the flavor and size of my sandwhich.  Well what you pay for!  I'm not a dill pickle fan, but they were fresh and you could tell they were homemade.

Small but quaint deli/restaurant with plenty of seating.  Clean and neat and friendly service.  Parking is a pain even though they are located in a shopping center with a lot of spaces.  This place is popular!  Not located at the most ideal of intersections, but you don't wait too long to get in or out of the area."}
{"text":"The place is homey and friendly. The staff is very nice, quick, and efficient. 

However, the menu is way too long. Took us a long time to read through, understand the difference between the various sandwiches and entrees.
It is also pretty pricey. Over $10 for a deli sandwich is more than I like to spend for lunch, for example.
I did like the free pickles (you need to ask for them), but the rest of it was just Ok.
I might go back just to try some of the Jewish cuisine items."}
{"text":"Love the food
Love Kenny
Love the jell rings 
The food is always amazing and the place is clean. The cashiers are friendly and the food is fresh. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"MY experience with Corky and Lenny's was good really because of the service. When I walked in, people were happy to greet me and I got seated promptly. My server was cool and she made the environment fun for me. We ordered promptly and was offered their signature pickles to snack on. I enjoyed the buzz in the resetaurant from the families to the grandpa taking his grandaughter out for a chocolate phosphate for the first time.

I got a half soup (Matzo Ball) and half sandwich (Corned Beef). The Matzo Ball soup was flimsy, a giant brick of matzo ball in the middle of clear broth with not very many vegetables. Eating the matzo ball was like eating a dense sponge, i've had better. My corned beef sandwich was good but no frills, literally corned beef between two slices of bread. I think I would come back just to try something else on the menu but for me the environment made the meal, not the food."}
{"text":"Been coming here my whole life. In my opinion the best deli in Cleveland. Sandwiches just keep getting bigger as well. Great corned beef and matzo ball soup. Id take Slymans and Corkys any day of the week."}
{"text":"Best deli around! I honestly love everything there, I can't even begin to pick. They treat you like family there and everything is always fresh and fast. The corned beef is unreal. Make sure you ask for pickles!!"}
{"text":"Best deli in America. Anyone who says otherwise is just a hater."}
{"text":"Fantastic deli. Best Matzo ball I've ever had. The Rugalah was super yummy too. Not really a big meat eater, so the sandwiches were lost on me. Love the surly wait staff too, it adds to the feel. Glad to find out they ship!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.   I grew up in Cleveland and remember this deli as being so delish!  Guess you can't go back to your childhood.   
Pickles: not very crunchy, salty brine only.
Matzo ball soup:  Very heavy matzo balls and broth had no flavor.
Brisket of beef:  The gravy was so salty that it could not be eaten.

After I got the mazto ball soup, I told the waiter it was not very good.  I only had about 3 bites and had ordered the large bowl with the 2 matzo balls.  Matzo balls were heavy and broth was REALLY bland.   I can make better matzo ball soup out of a box at home!

When we got to the register, we told the cashier that the food was not all that good.   Her response \"Why didn't you send it back?\"   We said we just wanted to mention it on the way out and were not looking for a refund.  (To be noted, the server did not deduct the soup and overcharged for the brisket sandwich and not the platter, it was only a $1)

The cashier called the manager who offered us some discount cards since she had already sent the CC through.  We don't live in the area, so we turned down the cards.    I think the manager felt bad, because we are pretty nice folks despite the bad food.   Anyway, next time we get back to Cleveland, maybe I will go back to Sands Delicatessan (if it is still around) and see if it is still how I remember it...."}
