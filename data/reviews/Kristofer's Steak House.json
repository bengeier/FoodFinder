{"text":"Overpriced for the quality, but I couldn't walk past the place even one more time without finding out.  Got that out of my system."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for work (seriously) and went to dinner at Kristofer's.
I ordered surf and turf (~$60), and lobster was ok, and they screwed my steak THREE TIMES!!!  This place suppose to be upscale, but felt cheap.  I don't know, felt expensive for no reason.  Thank GOD my company paid for the meal.  I think big mac would've tasted better.  Only reason i gave it two stars is when they messed up my steak for third time, they gave me free drinks."}
{"text":"Must try DESSERT first! Thats probably the only good thing here. The food was mediocre and according to the people I was with, the steaks were bland and not the right cut or cook.  Their food is not worthed! For a supposed upscale dimly lit dinning, this place is bland. Don't waste your time or money here... except for their dessert! Which you can always get to GO."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We ordered a bottle of wine and the cork broke as they were opening it.  So the manager bought us a $80 bottle of wine on her.  She was super nice.  We ordered fried zucchini as an appetizer and it was amazing.  This is the one of the few places that I have ever been to that cooked my steak perfect, Med Rare warm on the inside.  The crab was wonderful and the desert, forget about it.  We loved it so much that we decided to eat here two nights in a row.  Wonderful, expensive but wonderful."}
