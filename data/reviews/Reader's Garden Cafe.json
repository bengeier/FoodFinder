{"text":"Born and raised in Calgary but having gotten used to living in The Okanagan - this hidden gem is a very pleasant surprise nestled in the inner city! With its charm and rustic feel, the experience feels like a weekend getaway rather than just a meal. One can tell that both the food AND service is about quality & not quantity; but yet you leave on a full stomach! Now really...isn't that what it should be about? :-)"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this existed until recently and tried it out today. The rating is 5 for location, views and atmosphere being in a fabulous garden overlooking the city on a hilltop. We were concerned about service and the food as there seems to be very mixed reviews. Service was actually pretty good, considering there was only one server for the entire restaurant and the owner which helped her out. Food was not bad but nothing to write home about. We had the classic benedicts served on a scone and the Hugo cocktails. Would rate 3 for food and drink. Restaurant decor itself is dated but had a certain charm to it. The dishes are a little pricey but understand it is necessary given the prime location. Wouldn't return for a meal but would revisit for a nice walk around the garden.   The accessibility is not great for wheelchairs or those that have mobility difficulties. You park at the bottom of the hill and walk up to the cafe (look for the signs to direct you to the cafe). The footpath are stone stairs through the garden and are decently steep. Wheelchair access is on the side on gravel path but still steep."}
{"text":"Situated next to the beautiful Readers garden (and a cemetary on the other side), this historic landmark has some really wonderful food. Local and as organic as it comes."}
{"text":"This is a Historic place to bring your best friend, your grandma, or a group of ladies for an afternoon with a view of downtown and the Saddledome. The walk up to the house is spectacular as you wind your way through indigenous plants, wild flowers and trees indigenous to Southern Alberta and the Calgary area. The house is a replica of one that stood on that site back in 1912 and was owned by the Reader family whose father was a parks superintendent. The hours for the cafe are from 11-3 pm Thursday - Sunday.  I have been two times now and both were very different based on the service. If it's too hot for tea, I suggest a pitcher of Sangria which is made fresh to order. Follow with the Blackcurrant Sumac Scones which come with clotted cream and house preserves. The salmon eggs Benedict were fantastic! They were so good, I had them the second time around.  It's best to make a reservation and outdoor seating is first come first served. If you have any mobility issues, call ahead and you can drive up to the front door instead of walking from down in the parking lot. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Calgary since 1986, and yet I only recently discovered this place on the hilltop of Readers Garden. It's a beautifully restored heritage estate home that feels utterly secluded from the bustle of the city below. I ordered the free range buttermilk chicken sandwich with the featured soup of the day--delicious and filling, with fresh, high quality local ingredients put together with care."}
{"text":"Today was a beautiful fall day... all the leaves are turning yellow and orange!  A perfect afternoon to go visit this garden paradise in Calgary!  This was always a place I've wanted to visit and I'm glad my husband & I visited it!  It's such a beautiful calm place and I will have to come back and see it in the spring as well as summer to see various flowers blooming!  There were many rock paths leading up and around various garden areas.  The jagged rock steps may be difficult for those who do not have sturdy balance and you have to be careful not to trip or stumble in some areas.  But I enjoyed our walk around as well as my husband!  The cafe was closing so we did not have afternoon coffee here but there were several customers enjoying themselves earlier inside!  A very beautiful garden setting and many people taking garden photos .  A nice place for wedding or engagement pictures or forest like setting.  There are little waterfalls, a wooden pagoda, lovely wooden bridge , unique tree shapes and a beautiful stone wall for photo taking.  Go check out this lovely place and you will love it!  Fall is so beautiful in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with family members from out of town. The food was generally ok, they forgot my toast and didn't bring it until after we were finished.   The customer service was poor,  we overhead the chef swearing and at one point he was arguing with customers who were waiting for their food. I wouldn't eat there again.   Not sure what the other reviews are about but I would take them with a grain of salt."}
