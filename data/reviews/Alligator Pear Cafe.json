{"text":"Interesting lattes. The barista/owner is a chef who creates these custom blends of syrup for the lattes such as PB&J, Apple Pie, etc. I wasn't in the mood for a latte but got a coffee with a shot of the shortbread syrup and it was amazing. Looking forward to going back for a latte."}

{"text":"They draw you in with the Peanut Butter and Jelly latte sign, but then you see the cafe owner has created over 50 types of \"weird lattes\" as she describes them...including cookie dough and banana bread.  The latte was amazing - real peanut butter! $4  It's in a furniture store, The Design Republic, which doesn't mind if you hang out at their tables and do some work on your computer or just sip your latte. They will give you an internet password if you ask for it, which eventually works....  The owner is also incredibly nice and laughs happily when you chat with her."}
