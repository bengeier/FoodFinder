{"text":"It's nothing fancy, but the food is always good and the service is often exceptional. Regulars get treated like family."}
{"text":"They pre-make their food and what you are getting is reheated and can be up to a few days old. they don't temp check their food and what you get isn't always warm. they often get our orders wrong. Their workers gossip about costumers and about each other. the staff texts while they should be serving and you can hear fighting from the kitchen on occasion about personal stuff. They have favorites among the customers and if you aren't a regular then they don't give you as well of service as they could.  They hardly clean the bathrooms and the tables aren't always sanitary wiped off after others eat at it. once when i ate here, some lady came in with a plastic bread twist cooked into her pizza. I do not suggest eating here. it is unprofessional and not clean."}
{"text":"Hunners Deli is one of those hidden gems(hidden gems, I said, please kick me). I never paid much attention to it going in and out of the Lemon Tree. But one day I stopped in and got some pizza. mm damn it was good. They even deliver to Oakdale and, AND, THEY SELL MILK!!! I Love Milk, if you know me, you know a gallon a day is easy. to get Pizza and Milk delivered is great. I think they might sell cigarettes too, wonder if they deliver those? hmm
My only negative is that 3 outta 5 times that I ordered the exact same thing , the prices were different. (-1)"}
