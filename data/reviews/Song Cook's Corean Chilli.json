{"text":"This restaurant specializes in Korean-style Chinese cuisine, i.e., jja jang myun and jjam pong.    I had the jjam pong (spicy seafood noodle soup, $5-something?) twice and it was OK, not great. The broth lacks the soul-satisfying depth I expect from this dish. Instead, it's super spicy and will leave an unintentional lipliner of burn around your mouth. The noodles also need some perk; they're too flaccid for my liking. The good part of the soup is that it's brimming with fresh squid, mussels, and baby shrimp. It's got more seafood than a feed bucket for Shamu.   On another visit I had the jja jang myun ($5.75). If you watch Korean dramas, these are the noodles in brown sauce some homely girl is always slurping down at midnight while pining for her Prince Charming. Based on the Chinese zha jiang mian, the dish looks like spaghetti Bolognese made with black bean sauce instead of tomato sauce. The sauce here is thin and runny, and heavy on the ginger. Unfortunately, every once in a while, I get a craving for this dish but I don't know of any other restaurant on Bloor that serves jja jang myun.  The service is better than what I expect at cheapo Korean joints and this is the reason for the third star. The waitresses come by the table often to refill the side dishes and cups of barley tea. And, once, when the S.O. told the server he was really hungry, she scored him an extra big portion gratis.   As an added dining bonus, you can watch the latest K-Pop stars on the Korean television programs displayed throughout the restaurant. Without it, I wouldn't have found out about the tune called \"Mazeltov\" by Ze:A. Here are some of the choice lyrics:  Latin girl, Mexican girl, American girl Japan girl, Korean girl The thumping heart doesn't stop. yeh yeh yeh mirror mirror mirror.  Mazeltov, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday Mazeltov, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday  See the vid here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MnRBpktyWA"}
{"text":"We go to the mississauga location pretty often and have tried a lot of their offerings.  Their food is always yummy, good portion and priced appropriately.  There's also a lot of seatings so you never have to wait too long.  The only negative is their restaurant name confusion.. there's around 3 \"names\" on their door.. which one is it?  All, or most of their dishes we've tried there are very delicious and in good sized portions.  We usually go there for their famous Black Bean Noodles but this time around, we opted for something new: Marinated Bulgogi (Beef) Hotpot for 2, which comes with the full stew cooked at your table with two rice bowls.    The broth was so flavourful! In addition to the bulgogi, the obvious ingredient, there were glass noodles, bok choy, mushrooms, red peppers, sliced rice cakes and zucchini.  After it's been cooking for a while, we asked for extra broth.  We also got spicy calamari.  There's pieces of steamed calamari, sliced onion, green onion, carrots, and zucchini in a spicy sauce, served on a sizzling hot plate.  DELICIOUS!  Their Mugunji Pork Ribs, which is aged Kimchi stew with pork ribs.  This is also cooked at your table with mushrooms, green onions, sliced rice cakes and various veggies alongside the pork in the spicy stew.  This is delicious in cold weather with some steamed rice.    Other popular dishes here that we've had previously: - Kan Jajang (special black bean noodles).  Instead of their regularblack bean sauce, the noodles come separate with their fresh black beach sauce, which is cooked again with onion and zucchini (this is a good option for vegetarians as regular BB noodles have meat in it)  - Marinated Steamed Beef Ribs: Beef short ribs with potato and carrot in a delicious sauce.  This is a perfect side dish to any entree you order.  - Seafood Black Bean Noodles: Same as a regular BB, but with seafood - this is a share size.  - BB noodles with Sweet & Sour Pork Combo: Perfect for those days where you want a little of everything.  Half portion of regular BB noodles with half portion of tang-soo-yuk (deepfried pork strips in sweet & sour sauce)"}
{"text":"So glad that there's a Song Cook's downtown! Their uptown location is arguably one of the best places to get Korean food. I think they only recently brought in their full menu.  We went there recently to try out their hot pot and got the kimchi mandu one. I don't usually like dumplings but it was really good- had a nice pork flavour. The broth was also good and isn't too spicy. It was also packed with ingredients.   Their menu in general is great. They have a lot of combos for individuals and groups that are really affordable.  The service was also excellent. We interacted with two people there and they were both very friendly and attentive. We didn't wait too long for our food and the waitress had absolutely no problem with my partner asking for banchan refills.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you want good Korean food in the city!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars - I've been coming here a few times every now and then when I'm in the area and the food is always pretty good. Lately, I've noticed that some of the portion sizes are getting smaller - not sure why.  Recently I ordered their pork bone soup and the amount of meat that I got was really negligible compared to before and compared to other places. I usually get full after I finish the dish and the rice but I was still hungry afterwards - I filled myself up with the side dishes. I also tried the soondaegook (blood sausage soup) which was a huge disappointment and really different than other places. It was served in an almost transparent broth - which is much different that what I'm used to as I believe it is typically served in a red spicy broth flavoured with the gochujang. Maybe it was made differently here or it was a different style, but either way, it wasn't really appetizing. There was also only like 4 pieces of the blood sausage in the broth too.   This place has other great dishes though. I really like the jajangmyeon and the great affordable lunch deals! Maybe I won't come back here for the dishes I talked about above but I would definitely come back here for some of their other dishes."}
