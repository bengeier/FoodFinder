{"text":"Wishing there were more locations -- but in Henderson @ Green Valley Parkway, you'll find wonderful food, juices, and ambiance with many vegan and gluten free options that do not sacrifice on taste. I send all my clients there!"}
{"text":"This place is an okay lunch stop.
Prices are fair for what you get.
Its clean and bright
Decor is cheerful.
Mom had the veggie burger was a little overcooked and dry but its just a burger.
I had the vegetable wrap it was good.
We didnt care for the hibiscus iced tea.
Grilled artichoke  appetizer wasnt cooked enough.
It is a quick lunch spot in the District 
Not a five star restaurant so we were overall fine with a $35
Lunch."}
{"text":"The food here is actually pretty good. 

They lost a star because of the to-go orders. Unfortunately, my to-go order wasn't correct (I didn't get an add-on that I paid for). I had to drive back to the restaurant to get it fixed which was a bit of a hassle. The point of to-go order is fast in and fast out. 

My advice if you order to take-out: check your food there before you leave. It sucks that the customers have to check the restaurant's work but it's better than driving all the way back once getting home."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Second time in a week that coffee is terrible. First time, no flavor, just water. Today cold. I informed a lady and she said she would prepare a fresh pot. After 20 mins, when I finished eating, I asked for my coffee and the response was that I would have to wait, for a fresh pot to be brewed. As ridiculous as it sounds, I said I would wait and coffee came with no flavor at all... Hot though."}
{"text":"This place is very clean. The menu didnt impress me. There was nothing special. I dont think i will go back."}
{"text":"The food was good...once it finally all arrived. Our appetizer arrived literally 30 seconds before 2 of our 4 entrees. Unfortunately the other 2 entrees did not arrive for another 20 minutes. Additionally, the beer that someone in my party ordered was out, but the front did not know. He was notified about 10 minutes after we sat down, after another server had brought the other drinks and assured us that his beer was on the way.  The concept is good; it is a healthy eating restaurant with a trendy menu and decor theme. However, the operations on the day we went were severely lacking."}
{"text":"Entering life kitchen feel great. And honestly a bit on the sterile. Kinda like a hospital. Not very cozy. Unless you bring a companion I got here at 5 o'clock and they lacked the accoutrements for four things that my party ordered. Which wasn't a big problem however they weren't able to offer me a solution or accommodate me otherwise. We were forced to order other things off the menu and since this was my first time was a little disconcerting.  I ordered the grass fed burger and fish tacos. It is quite tasty however a party 3 cost me 85 dollars. Probably won't be coming back here due to cost effectiveness"}
{"text":"(I go here a lot!) Corn chowder is seriously mind blowing!! Fish tacos are good, nothing special. The salmon is really good, but the tomato purée is a little weird. Brussel sprouts are delicious! Sweet potato fries are awesome. Chips and guac are not worth the price. \"Art's unfried chicken\" is one of the best items on the menu!! Don't pass it up! Also, the edamame hummus: Divine! Service is ALWAYS friendly. Love the outdoor seating. Love the 3 water options. MUCH BETTER than greens & proteins; Healthy food that actually tastes good!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was great! Service was good, the restaurant looks very upscale and modern love it! I had the California Chicken Sandwich, delicious! Also had their pomegranate ginger lemonade, they let you sample it before trying it ! And usually I'm not a fan of ginger but it isn't that noticeable which is great! They also have great breakfast options, will come back !"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, definitely a positive! The portions were good sized, but seemed pre-made. My husband and I enjoy a healthy lifestyle, but the food was a disappointment. The sweet potato fries were cold and soggy. I ordered the pizzadilla and it was ok, nothing special. My husbands burger seemed like it can from a supermarket pre made bag and was cold. I may come back in a few months to see if it improves, but was not thrilled."}
{"text":"Good location with a wholefood nearby... There were few choices for breakfast. It's healthy but tastes not that yummy"}
{"text":"Tried the \"Edamame\" Hummus Plate and I added quotation marks because there was snap peas instead of edamame. Not sure if this was a mistake or if it's actually served that way, but they're both completely different. Besides that, the plate had other vegetables and I liked the freshness of the hummus. 

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. It was kinda small and it only came with 3 slices of an orange, so if you eat a lot, I suggest you order something to go with it. I was glad that there wasn't too much lettuce. There was a decent amount of each ingredient to make this wrap flavorful. 

My boyfriend ordered the Chicken, Mushroom, Spinach Penne. We both thought it tasted ok. The flavor was like any other pasta with these ingredients, nothing too special. 

He also ordered the Cucumber Mint Water. He liked it, but to me, the cucumber flavor was too overwhelming. I didn't really taste a hint of mint at all. 

I want to come back to try the other foods but the only thing that's stopping me is the price, so maybe when I have extra money to splurge."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing!! I suggested the parm sweet potato fries.  You can thank me later :)"}
{"text":"The delicious breakfast was only exceeded by the exceptional service! I highly recommend trying the zucchini carrot muffin and the buttermilk pancakes with Greek yogurt and fruit. Yummy goodness!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and was very impressed. I ordered the sweet chili tacos and cucumber mint water. The tacos were probably the best I've ever had and the water was so refreshing. My meal was about $15, which I think is excellent when you consider I could spend $10 on myself at Del Taco in a heartbeat. I also liked that the food portion was just right. I didn't leave feeling like a food coma was about to set in."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious!! We went vegan for all 4 of us. Quiona crunch wrap well worth it and matched well with veggie corn chowder. Little weird front end but I recommend grabbing one of 4 styles of menus then sitting down. It's simple. Just
Order at the counter and they'll bring it to you. Sparkling, ambient and chilled water all self serve. Easy once we figured it out. A new favorite place to eat!!!

I saw some negative reviews from comfort
Food nuts which I think is funny because the LYFE name should have been a hint the restaurant is gonna help with a longer life by eating healthier. 

Menus are:
Gluten free
Vegan/vegetarian
Everyone else
Wine and beer"}
{"text":"Food was salty. Not really a place to spend $$. I think greens and proteins is a better choice. My order was messed up so I ended up getting my appetizer last."}
{"text":"All I have to say is garlic parm sweet potato fries! Yum!!! I love lyfe! Although I feel their breakfast is better than the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Well, first and foremost, the food has an extremely bland taste. We ordered the hummus, buffalo chicken wrap and penne pasta. 75% into eating the wrap I came across a long, thick string in my mouth in which I thought was an onion or something.  I pulled it out and turns out it was a piece of fabric string, most likely from the chef's shirts being that it was the same color as their outfits. Now, I proceed to tell a food runner about the string and he takes it from me and says, \" I'll take care of it.\" 10/15 minutes later the runner is nowhere to be found and I had to catch him on the way back from the bathroom and asked what he was going to do about the situation. He replied, \"well would you like me to refire it again? I'll get a manager...\" So instead of asking me this right away, he walked away and forgot about me. So I see him tell the manager about my situation who is polishing silver. About 7 minutes later she decides to put down the silverware and come talk to us about what happened instead of with urgency upon hearing the news from the runner. Nice to know the silverware was of more importance than my dilemma. Yeah I'm never coming back here..."}
{"text":"Food is consistent but staff is not. Sometimes their lack luster attitudes make the experience not so great, but their food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food but horrendous service.  The waiters seem to walk around randomly to guess to whom to give the food.  I ordered dinner online and paid at store. They then lost the order and asked 'what did you get again'.  Bad management."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I haven't been to Lyfe Kitchen in a couple of years. I used to live this place! The first thing we noticed upon entering is that they no longer have the seperate menus for vegan/vegetarian, etc... they also got rid of most of the Gardein on the menu except for a couple of items with beefless tibs. True you can get tofu but not good. Most of the food did not seem very fresh. We were so disappointed we looked it up and sure enough the place was taken over by the Carlisle Corp and the CEO changed. Sadly they seem to have lost their way from the original mission. Given all the great vegan options in the area we won't be returning here."}
{"text":"This place has good healthy food. I would recommend to anyone looking for fast,easy and healthy food. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great selection of healthy options.  I had the avocado and chicken breast sandwich.  It was very tasty and low cal.  Def will be back."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend came for breakfast. I got the the breakfast burrito and she had the yogurt we both had a ginger mint water and shared a carrot zucchini muffin, everything was great the flavor in food really exploded... Really good simple healthy food"}
{"text":"Excelente!!! La comida increíble, el lugar muy limpio , buenas opciones , súper sano, servicio agradable , buena ubicación , buen estacionamiento"}
{"text":"This place was alright.  The lemonade was good but it didn't taste freshly squeezed. I ordered a chicken avocado sandwich.  It was super small and dry. There was hardly any avocado on the sandwich. Everything tasted so bland.  I felt like I needed to add some kind of sauce or anything just to make the sandwich okay.  The best part of the meal was the chips with salsa.  I recommend just getting that if you come here. Would I come here again?  I wouldn't come here again. It's really pricey for the little portions that they serve.  I give this place 1 star."}
{"text":"I'm visiting and moving to the area in Sept and my aunt has been wanting to try it. We decided to come in for lunch before we headed across the street to do some shopping. My mom and aunt both ordered the Mahi tacos with iced tea and I ordered the grass-fed burger with cheese and a side order of sweet potatoes fries, with a ginger pomegranate lemonade. All entrees come with a kale and carrot salad with a simple olive oil/lemon juice dressing. 

I tried their tacos and they had a lot of flavor. The sweet potatoes were baked to the perfect consistency and served with an agave ketchup...delish! The burger was served on an oat bun and normally I don't eat bread like that but it was so delicious! The side salad was a little blah but I didn't mind it too much. My lemonade had the perfect blend of ginger and pomegranate! 

The only downside to the experience was the noise level in the place. It was so loud it was hard to hear my mom and aunt who were sitting across the table. I'll definitely go back but I think I will just do take-out instead!"}
{"text":"Best fresh food in town! Love this place  
Healthy vegan and oraganic options.. 
along with a tons of flavor... try one of their infused waters!! Super yummy especially on a hot day"}
{"text":"Being originally from California I'm always looking for new healthy option places. This place is great! Amazing food and atmosphere the managers were present and the service was awesome! I had the fish tacos but I'll be back for breakfast I'm sure! Cute outdoor seating as well!"}
{"text":"My 2 star rating is an average of the 5 star staff, and (sorry to say) the 1 star food.  I have only been to this one location, so I can't tell if the menu problems are simply with execution, or if the ingredient lists need help as well.  Firstly, we dine with our nine year old, who is a foodie just like her folks, but has a less tolerant palate!  

The decor and style of the resteraunt is beautiful...very farm-to-table chic...I could adopt the decor and take it all home. 

While the ordering process is straight forward, I was painfully aware that I was paying for lease location, probably not food quality.

Once our meals arrived,  everything I tried was very, very peppery...not spicy and savory, just loads of black pepper.  My daughter had the kids \"not fried\" chicken fingers. They arrived at the tqble \"blackened\" on one side from a salamander reheat. Our daughter explained that they were too spicy, so I had to give them a taste. When I did, I immediately spit my bite out into my napkin....my bad, but just not going to swallow and burn all night.

The BBQ chicken flatbread was also burnt, crisper than a saltine cracker, and extremely spicy. Given that Lyfe makes their own sauces, they could balance the vinegar and savory notes in the BBQ with something other than salt and pepper, pepper, pepper.

On several positive notes, the sweet potato fries and homemade ketsup are great, despite more salamander char than expected, and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the Mahi tacos. Another plus (believe it or not) is that the sparkling water dispenser is often broken, so Pelligrino is complementary on those occasions.

My takeaways from this experience are: Lyfe kitchen is a great concept, with either poorly trained or poorly executing chef staff, or the recipes are in serious need of help.  This location is probably suffering financially and forced to limit the freshness of product by reheating kids meal elements. The substitution of baking for frying means they have to turn up the broiler to get food to the table in reasonable times -- so expect burnt ends (and some middles.) 

Knowing all this, I would choose wisely from the menu, likely selecting a caprese salad and sweet potato fries if I ever return....or if they are not shuttered in the next 18 months."}
{"text":"It was really great when it first opened but the last few times it wasn't great. The drinks are good. I got a special with eggs and avocado and it was too heavy and greasy, especially for a healthy place!"}
{"text":"Thai curry bowl was refreshing & delicious. Happy hour pint of beer & a bodini for desert."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Wednesday at 1 p.m. and the place was full of nine to fiver's on lunch break and families or moms with their kids. Upon entry, a rack of four menus are labeled and organized into columns; gluten free, vegan/ vegetarian, everything and wine/ beer. 

For someone who is used to having a few vegan options on a regular menu, an entire veggie menu took a few minutes to take in. It was so busy I assured a handful of hungry regulars looking to pass by I was not in line yet. I narrowed it down to the vegan kale Caesar salad with Gardein chick'n strips and the tofu tacos... the chipotle aioli and marinated tofu steered me to the tacos. 

I placed my order of tacos and my date had to clarify the non-vegan nature of his order because the cashier assumed he was vegan too. We added the chunky guacamole, a vanilla milkshake and lemonade. I asked for water as well, but my date observed the self serve H20 station after we had sat down. There were water options as well; room temperature, cold and sparkling.  

We walked outside and the misters were in full mist mode. Yellow umbrellas provided  shade and complimented the bright nature of the decor. The guacamole came to the table on a wooden serving plate with house baked tortillas. It was good, but nothing special. My date found it bland. 

Our beverages came shortly after. The milkshake was more of a smoothie concoction, it contained bananas, soy milk and dates. Again, it was good but not special. The lemonade was delicious, it simply tasted like lemon.

The entrees arrived and the reality of the calorie and sodium counts on the menu set in. For those watching their calorie intake, two tacos and a side salad for less than 500 calories is great but I feel the price should be lower for the amount of food on the plate. 

The tacos were filled with a variety of crisp veggies, aioli, tofu and avocado. In that order. They were fresh and filling, but the tofu was a bit bland and the overall combination of ingredients was not memorable. 

I will try this place again though. It has a cool ambiance, immaculate cleanliness and the fact that every dish is less than 600 calories is impressive.  That vegan kale chick'n Caesar is calling me."}
{"text":"This place was okay, totally did not live up to the hype of all the other reviews. Let me first start off with my order:
I ordered the corn chowder, no problem there.
I wanted to get the scaloppini chicken dish, which I was told went by a different name now (art something) and cost $1 more than the menu stated. Fine... Annoying, but okay.
I also wanted a banilla shake (I had a sore throat and thought it'd be nice) well they were all out. Someone I was with also wanted a salad that was supposed to have kale in it, but I guess they were all out of kale (really guys?).
So then for the actual taste of the food:
Corn chowder - this was really delicious. Came out first and got me really excited for the main course.
The art (chick'n scaloppini thing): maybe just a really bad choice, but this was not great. The Brussels sprouts were undercooked and somewhat tough. The gardein scaloppini was cooked well, but completely flavorless. I guess I could have dipped it into the mediocre sauces, but that wouldn't help much.

So other than that, the place was pretty clean and had a nice layout. The food was healthier than most around I think, so that's a plus. I'm pretty sure I won't return though."}
{"text":"I ordered quinoa wrap.i really like it: tasty and fresh. The smoothie is also good. I ordered kale banana smoothie. Really like the lemon flavor"}
{"text":"Ultimately, this restaurant came down to the fact that a vegan and vegetarian options restaurant was needed in Henderson, apart from Go Raw Cafe on Eastern and Windmill. 
I found the space to be very nice and open, and the staff to be generally helpful. That is, the first time I went. That first day I had the Chick'n pasta with Spinach and Mushrooms, which was alright. It didn't have too much flavor, and I really crave flavor being a vegetarian and not eating processed foods. Honestly, it just needed some salt and pepper, which it ended up receiving. My friend had the quinoa wrap along with a Banilla Shake. The wrap was flavorless, and with the spicy sauce on the side, it only gave the wrap a kick but was unable to bring out the flavor within the wrap itself. The shake was good, with a very strong banana flavor as expected.  This time, I would've given it 3 1/2 stars. 

Now, for the second visit. My friend and I, again, went to try something different. We had the crunchy chips and guac, along with the margherita flatbread. The chips and guac came out in about 10 minutes, which was fine because I felt that meant they were preparing it fresh. Once we started eating, we both looked at each other and realized the chips were EXTREMELY hard and very difficult to chew. In fact, I bit into a chip and cut the inside of my mouth, true story. The guacamole and salsa that were served with it were OK, but again lacked flavor. The flatbread was OK but again, NO FLAVOR. I feel like this restaurant just doesn't season anything. I understand they use natural ingredients to flavor their food but this is ridiculous. Put some salt and pepper on the food prior to serving please. We finally had the chocolate Bundino which had a chocolate sort of pudding/mousse on top of pomegranate chia seeds. It was......interesting? It tasted ok but it was just a very strange combination of textures that was off pu(dd)ing. Also, once we asked a question about the food, the staff seemed to have no idea what was going on.  Overall, I would've given this visit 2 stars, only because the flatbread was alright.

Although this restaurant did not deliver, I'm giving it three stars. I feel that it still has some promise. They need to refine some recipes and clearly get their act together. I suppose they're making certain things well, however, due the the large amount of people in the establishment..."}
{"text":"I will say I've only been their once but I would seriously consider going back. The food is decent but the value is not there. I had arts untried chicken which was good. The veggies were really good underneath it. However, the artichoke was way over priced and just not worth it. The sweet potato fries were good but again, they were over priced for what you get. At the end of the day I do expect to pay a little bit more for the food but I just don't really see the value.

Hopefully Vegas will attract more healthy alternatives that are affordable so people can eat healthy at a value."}
{"text":"When you walk in you think damn this place is gonna be to healthy and no flavor because of how neat and clean and organic looking it is but this place is so damn tasty it should be labeled fast food they really know what they are doing I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and sweet potato fries this is my 2nd time here and I will totally be returning"}
{"text":"Being pescatarian, having vegan friends, this was the perfect spot for my friends reunion last weekend. The selection of food was amazing, the mimosas were great and the choice of water selection was super neat! Highly recommended. Will be back."}
{"text":"Finally went out to try this place and it turned out to be just ok. The service was pretty decent. The cashier was friendly. We ordered the chicken avocado sandwiches? and the Farmhouse burger which is grass fed beef with cheddar (cheese is extra). Also ordered the sweet potatoes? fries with garlic parmesan. Total came out to $24.06, which is roughly what my Whole Foods lunch came out to as well. For the price and the impression of the store I would expecting lots of flavor and better portions. I got more bread than protein and I would say the chicken and beef was average. You're better off getting organic groceries and making it yourself for the price point. Is it a better option than your average fast food joint? Sure, but it won't be my first choice for good to go. May give this place another try for the Mahi Fish Taco, but not in a rush to do so."}
{"text":"Service and great. The food is delicious! Located in a very nice area. Been here quite a few times and has never disappointed. Busy but never to busy. Food comes out in a timely manner and they have bottomless mimosas for there brunch so sometimes that is hard to pass up!"}
{"text":"All the good reviews that I have read about this restaurant are true. The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. I have never seen such good customer service. Thank you Jojo for the great food experience!"}
{"text":"Shades of McDonald's. I have been to this location a few times and overall it has a good concept and the food is palatable. LK boasts: Healthy. Local. Sustainable. Healthy? Depends who you ask. Local? CA and well beyond; including internationally!? Sustainability? Quinoa from Peru and Bolivia. Upon, our recent visit, we saw from a distance, a gentleman sitting outside at a table WITHOUT his shirt on. As we are not anywhere near a beach, this is tacky and unhygienic. We debated even eating here just on this alone. Disturbed but, hungry, we decided to enter and order. I brought up the fact that there was a fellow customer dining sans shirt but, the cashier said \"I don't know him!\". OK!? No concern or further action taken on behalf of ANY of the staff. 2 stars because I want to support their intuitive but, I have reached out to their corporate office with these concerns and been ignored."}
{"text":"Many organic healthy options. Totally love their orange chia drink! Live the GF tacos!!
Last time I went there the menus were being changed and I loved having all those choices!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast & the manager had a family emergency, so the opening/set up was a little delayed (20min). To compensate, we were given a discount on our breakfast! The wait wasn't even that long, and we weren't inconvenienced too much, but needless to say, service was amazing. Even though they were delayed, the food was delicious! We were even offered an additional side for free, but we'd ordered more than enough to eat. The staff was very personable and friendly! Definitely returning :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan or know what gmo is, but like the food here, also has some nice beers on tap.
Always friendly and helpful staff"}
{"text":"Their menu is so good and full of options. Moreover, I ordered the spices tofu lettuce wraps and it was too spicy for me. They took it back and gave me one without the spicy sauce, no questions asked. We came during brunch as well and they ran out of champagne, so they comped me a beer while we waited for more champagne to arrive. They did everything to make sure we had a pleasant experience. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast lunch or dinner.  The food is fresh with simple twist of good cooking.  Clean and friendly staff.  I had the chicken curry dish with wheat berries instead of rice.  Loved the chewiness of the wheat berries and the curry was excellent.  My husband had the grass fed beef hamburger which was very good.  Most definitely we will return."}
{"text":"Great healthy options with modern decor. Similar format to a number of new restaurants - order and pay up front, self serve filtered sparkling or flat water - with attentive table service. Portions on the smaller side but solid food preparation and presentation."}
{"text":"The 1 star down is only bc it's a little pricey. This place just opened about a month ago and I'm very happy it did. Vegas doesn't have many healthy restaurants that you can go to so I really appreciate the few we do! I had the roasted salmon it's was pretty good and healthy and had a yummy sauce that made the dish. I also tried the hibiscus beet water. The venue is adorable and looks alive with bright colored walls and real flowers every day on each table. Patio seating, booths, and window seating! They also have a vegan menu and gluten free menu! I will be  coming back to try more items on menu :)"}
{"text":"Refreshing cucumber mint water and delicious food ! My go to is the farmers salad but I add grilled salmon and avocado ! The garlic Parmesan sweet potato fries are AMAZING"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. I had a to-go order. I waited and waited at the to-go counter and was completely ignored. I had to go stand in the regular line to pick up my food. Was a waste of time."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! The food was very fresh, delicious, and healthy. The atmosphere and staff were present as well. I would recommend to anyone looking for a low-key healthy place to grab a bite. Perfect place for vegan/ vegetarian..they do have meat options though."}
{"text":"Lyfe kitchen always disappoints. It's unfortunate because it could be really good. Asked for no cheese in omelette, got cheese. Brought my girlfriend wrong order and I was done before she even got hers. Probably last time eating here."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, fresh, clean. Luv the different menus. Prices are very reasonable. Will return."}
{"text":"We ordered OJ but it was out. We attempted to order fish tacos but they were out of the ingredients. We settled in and said okay let's order a Cafe Latee and enjoy the location but they were.. you guessed it out. My fiancé was sure the Yelp reviews were good so I skimmed through them and they were all fish tacos. We will never know. Figured I would try something simple so I ordered the chicken avo sandwich. It was 2.5 out of 5. Watery due to the runny aoile and thick tomato. The chicken was well cooked and the bun was okay. Overall very mediocre experience. I would not come here again unless I had to accommodate a vegan friend. Reviews are very misleading. As I always say try it for yourself! 

Good luck and happy new year!"}
{"text":"Every time i visit Vegas i eat here. Its such a bright, fresh, earth loving place!!! Everything i have eaten here is delicious. Super vegetarian and vegan friendly. Good coffees and refreshing waters. I swear walking out of here i feel full but Light! Mmm mmmm"}
{"text":"My Daughter & I love this place.  They have creative, healthy & tasty food & juices.  We live on the other side of town but will make it a point to stop when in Henderson."}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant and I love the water station in the back. The only complaint I have is that the portions are a bit small for the price. I ordered the chicken and the texture of the crust was rough and tough."}
{"text":"I ordered green salad with Parmesan chicken. The cahier was very helpful, the food portion was big, just needed more seasoning. I just wish they have sugar free dessert option."}
{"text":"Healthy options. Nice environment. Reasonable prices. Had the spinach frittata and chipotle potato hash. Both very good. Wish we had more healthy options like this around town."}
{"text":"THis is another of the endless (Concept) chains around the SW and LA. The food sucks. It is NOT high quality at all, rather all pre packaged commisary garbage
and the prep is highly automated. I watched the kitchen while my food was made. I was very similar to a Quiznos pizza joint. THe kale salad was all frills and little substance. Kale needs to be cooked to get the nutrients out of it. Same as spinach.
My fish tacos here were kind of wet and soggy and I have had better ones at any other place I have ordered them. The fresh water was good. And it was filtered and chilled. But thats the only good thing about this place. Everyone in LA tries to come up with yet another concept to rake in the money but few are doing quality. Do us a favor.
If you cant do a real handmade good job with light casual then stay the hell out of the food business. PLEASE...."}
{"text":"The blackened Mahi was by far the best sandwich I've ever had. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for healthy fast food options."}
{"text":"Very fresh tasting, and light portions. I don't worry about vegan or gluten-free but they are respected for just that"}
{"text":"I don't mind paying $10 for a good burger, but these guys have a tiny 4oz $10 grass fed burger that comes from a frozen patty. Really? Get real guys"}
{"text":"Only eaten here once (only because I live on the other side of town) and freaking loved it. I'm a vegetarian (the boyfriend and daughter are not) and most restaurants we go to have very little to offer vegetarians other than a salad, or if I'm lucky, a veggie burger. 

Absolutely WONDERFUL selection of food, that tastes fresh and amazing!! The combinations seem as if a master chef had created them. Love the decor, and was really clean inside. Staff was friendly. I REALLY wish they would open one near Mountain's Edge (home)   :)"}
{"text":"Lyfe is amazing. I love their quinoa crunch bowl and corn chowder. So nice to have a spot to eat healthy while on the go. This isn't the cheapest place but you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Quality is inconsistent. Initially,  well liked, colorful presentation, friendly service.  Then fast forward 2-months from opening--and I get a frozen carrot muffin (not fresh), and soupy-consistency on the Thai curry bowl (which was once so hearty and perfectly prepared)."}
{"text":"I have been to Lyfe Kitchen several times and have enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere at every visit. So happy they opened in Henderson. They have kind and (professional) employees, and most importantly, really amazing food."}
{"text":"The burger was good..their menu has something for everyone. At first I was thinking the place is a little too yuppie for me. I'm a simple guy, so \"local\" and \"sustainable\" marketing messages are overused in my opinion.  This is Las Vegas, there is nothing local and sustainable about this town.

One odd thing...they use a Cajun like spice on the chicken fingers from the kids meal.  I can understand adding something a little different for adults. My 6 year old wasn't too pleased... I took a bite and noticed that the chicken fingers had a touch of heat.  I found that a bit odd. If you have kids, you'll understand what I am saying. 

But that being said we will be back."}
{"text":"Arrived for late breakfast/ lunch. At 10:30 could only get breakfasts. Good just average. Atmosphere was fast foodie. 
Coffee was good , but could only get 1 cup. Would of liked another ."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm at this place everyday! Breakfast, lunch and dinner...the food is great and always consistent. I normally order the Thai Curry Bowl with Tofu, the Spinach, Mushroom and Penne pasta dish (I sub for Gardein Chicken) or the Quinoa Crunch Wrap. These are great for lunch or dinner. For breakfast, you can't beat the Morning Tofu Wrap or the Egg & Turkey Sausage Sandwich which I sub out the turkey for the Gardein Sausage. This is the ultimate breakfast sandwich!!! The staff is nice and always prompt. Don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. Order taker was inconsiderate to food allergies with my mom about substitute sides even after she allowed me to do so prior to my moms order. Then my daughters chicken and fries showed up burnt and cold. I have enjoyed previous visits when the place first opened but see it has quickly went downhill."}
{"text":"The food is fine. I really like the salads. They're just soooo sloooow. There's absolutely no sense of urgency. As if they're surprised to have people there. They have this great idea they just don't have the culture to carry it out."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! Sometimes you want to indulge in good food, but then you regret eating all the fattening and unhealthy foods in the world. This place allows you to make healthy food decisions and you leave the restaurant not regretting a thing. They offer vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and everything to ensure that everyone in your party can enjoy. Let's start with the drinks, my party tried the Cucumber Mint Lyfe Water, the Orange Ginger Chia Lyfe Water, the Mango Cucumber Lime Smoothie, and the Classic Lemonade. All the drinks were very unique in ingredients, refreshing, and delicious, you have to try them all!!! Next the appetizer, we had the Grilled Artichokes and these were hard to eat because I've never ate Artichokes before, but they were still very delicious. For soups, we tried the Squash Lemongrass and it was excellent, it is a very good choice for anyone who likes squash. Unfortunately, we did not try any salads, but I'm sure it will not be a disappointment the next time i go. For sandwiches and burgers, we tried the Grass-Fed Burger and the Pizzadillawich, personally, if you go here, try something besides the burger, not that it's not delicious, but that you'd miss out on all the unique dishes, and as for the PIzzadillawich, it was so worth it! Lastly, I chose the Chicken, Mushroom and Spinach Penne. I chose to do the vegan option and got this dish with the Gardein Chick'n and it was not a disappointment at all, it tasted just like chicken! This is a visually appealing restaurant that has a contemporary design and the food had great presentation."}
{"text":"LYFE Kitchen is a great restaurant for a date or for catching up with a friend. It has a casual and relaxing setting, perfect for setting the atmosphere.

The farmhouse burger was a good choice. The burger is juicy and flavorful. The portion is small so don't expect a filling entree. It came with sweet potato fries which complements the burger well. The vegetables used as the burger filling was fresh and clean and added nice texture to the burger. Overall I'd order the burger again.

The blackened ahi sandwich was also a good entree. The fish didn't stand out too much, but I was a fan of the avocado used in the sandwich. Again, it's not too filling, but the sweet potato fries fill out the portion.

There's no wait staff so you have to serve yourself water. The restaurant is clean and the tables are spaced out well so you're not feeling like you're cramped up with the other patrons.

I recommend LYFE kitchen for anyone looking for a good place to study or hang out with friends."}
{"text":"On my way to the office I decided to stop in to see what they had to offer. I was excited because I'm a super fan of any new health conscious eating establishment.  Being a vegetarian has definitely limited my options over the year and I long for variety!   It was lunch time and it was a mad house.  I ordered a kale Caesar to go.  I must've waited at least 20 min for such a simple item, but again it was lunch time so I was patient.  When I finally arrived at my office, which was about 15 min from there, I realized there was no dressing on my salad.  Imagine the mini food melt down I was having after that wait!  I immediately called fuming and the manager did a fabulous job of taming my rage level.  He asked if he could send someone to my office with the right salad because he didn't want to ruin my lunch.  He also asked if I wanted an add on like veggie chicken on the house.  How could I be mad? They arrived in less than 20 min with the order and extra dressing.  Now that's how to handle a crappy situation and keep em coming back!  The salad was good but the Customer service was great :)"}
{"text":"LYFE Kitchen (LK) has grown on me. In the past year I've been back a number of times and each time enjoyed my experience more than the last. 

CON/PRO: I am not a fan of \"slick\" looking health food restaurants. I realize that I carry some hippy expectation of earthy meets raw meets community. But that's my own bias and I needed a few visits for me to get past what LK is NOT and to appreciate LK for what it is. Had I written a review after my first visit, I am sure I would have been complaining about the chain-feel to the place. There is a pushiness and an aggressive efficiency that makes me feel rushed when I'm there. But after looking for a healthy (ish) place to go catch up with friends, LK was one of the few places in town that fit all of our criteria. 

Some folks will be drawn to the obvious attempts to cultivate a hipster vibe--I am not. Are they using the herbs in the entry area? I hope so. But I appreciate what they are doing at LK. It's clean and well run. And while limited, they have food options that let you feel good about yourself when you are leaving. 

THE FOOD: Here is the primary issue. The food is just ok. The options sound tantalizing, but the execution lacks flavor and.....options.

We chose LK for breakfast since I am not eating animal protein and needed a place that I could eat along side friends looking for lighter (while not vegan) fare. I ordered a deconstructed Morning Veggie Wrap Vegan Breakfast Brunch. It's the ONLY vegan option on a very small breakfast menu and I tweaked it with: with no tortilla, no daiya cheddar or avocado, add extra arugula. And it was solid. But considering I had to modify the dish and it offered no flavors that an inexperienced chef couldn't pull together, I was a little disappointed. And I am ready to start citing west coast restaurants that don't offer a passable \"salsa fresca\". Work on that LK.

But like so many places in town, this spot isn't primarily for eating. This is a place that offers a lovely modern ambiance ad a peaceful location to order something more healthy than not. And sip on tea and catch up with friends. This is not a place to come to really have an experience with food. 

But it's solid. And now that I know about the breakfast/brunch option, if I need a place off the 215 to eat with friends, I will likely be back."}
{"text":"I've dined at Lyfe kitchen many times and it's very disappointing that they have absolutely nothing on the menu that's organic. The food is just average. I did a yelp search and they came up under organic - I'm not sure why?!"}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere of LYFE Kitchen...bright, airy and beautifully decorated. I also liked how they offered an area with water and sparkling water, which was a first for me. If they had ice there, it would've been perfect since the waters were room temperature. However, I didn't enjoy my steak and potato dish. It didn't have much flavor and was very dry and tough although it was cooked medium. The portion was also very small and not worth the $18, consisting of a small cut of meat with a few dice-cut potatoes and cherry tomatoes. The corn chowder soup wasn't bad, though, with some nice choice of vegetables inside. I didn't care for how it was served to me though. It was served from behind and when I unknowingly turned around the person delivering almost hit me in the face with it, surprising me. Overall, I wasn't impressed other than how it looked and left hungry and stopped at Taco Bell on my way home."}
{"text":"This place has potential to be amazing, but sadly it fell very short of that. It's nice to have a place that offers so many types of food for gluten free, vegan, etc. I've gone a few times and every time the staff is extremely disorganized and they forget part of my order. Tracking someone down to help me is near impossible. The food is average, some stuff is fairly bland. And the portion sizes are insanely small for the high price you pay. You will leave hungry here, so pack a snack!!"}
{"text":"I like the quinoa crunch wrap and the baked sweet potato fries, here. To drink, the cucumber mint water. I've also had the 'un-fried chicken', which was nice with lots of oven roasted vegetables. Not a fan of the atmosphere inside, but it's nice to sit outside on the patio. Even my picky teen likes the food here, which is saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Food was 10/10 good and healthy. Came here with a few friends because Jojo recommended it and it did not disappoint. I feel like if there was restaurant in Whole Foods it would be called Lyfe Kitchen. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a place like this in Vegas. They offer three types of menus which are: Everything, Gluten Free & Vegan/Vegetarian. If you are calorie counting this is the place for you. If you aren't used to these portions you will be hungry when you leave.

I have eaten here several times and each time the food is prepared differently. I have eaten the Tofu Scramble Wrap which I love. However, the last time I ordered it, it was drenched in oil. I ordered it to go and did not have time to get a new one (this one took 10 mins to prepare). I don't want food drenched in oil, dripping out of my food when trying to be healthy. I ordered chips and guac and the artichoke to go. While eating the salsa with the chips and guac there was a piece of hair in the salsa. I called and they were apologetic and gave me a free appetizer next time. The next time I ordered the Kale Cesar to go and got home with no dressing. By all the disappointments it wasn't even worth calling because I keep going back so it's my own dang fault! 

Now, on to the waters! Delicious ideas BUT they use tap water. I cannot drink tap water with healthy ingredients! Completely defeats the purpose. When I saw the girl making my Ginger Chia Water and saw her go to the sink I asked if they use tap water. She said \"yeah like any other restaurant.\" This isn't supposed to be like any other restaurant.

While waiting for my food for to go orders on each occasion another customer had been complaining about the coffee being too cold, and something wrong with an order. One of the managers looks miserable and non approachable. 

This place could be great if they worked out these kinks and had consistency.  

Overall, the concept is great, everything is pricey and the food is hit or miss. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a great location! Their drinks, such as the pomegranate ginger, is sooo delicious! I love how Lyfe has supported our local community!"}
{"text":"My first time eating here. The service was great. I ordered sweet potato fries, salmon, and water with ginger mint chia seeds. Total cost, about $21.00 including tax.  Although my fries were slightly burnt and the salmon was a little over cooked, the food had great flavor. I enjoyed the clean relaxing atmosphere and yes, they provided plenty of highchairs."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. We were greeted promptly by the cashier.  I ordered the Chicken Kale Soup and Barramundi Noodle Bowl.  Service was prompt and both dishes were flavorful and low calorie, yet the portions were ample, 

My bf ordered the corn chowder and fish tacos and enjoyed both.  We definitely plan on returning to Lyfe Kitchen again. 

Dinner for two was $40, including beverages, which is very reasonable IMO."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! I ordered the kale Caesar salad and chicken buffalo strips. My sister had the pizzadillawich. We both thought they were so yummy! The kids pasta was eh. Pretty bland. 

The only complaint was it took my friends food 25 minutes to come out! So we were already done eating by the time her food came out!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Ordered through UberEats, fast delivery, and food was so tasty! Ordered a variety of items. Got the edamame hummus to start, the little breads it came with were delicious! And the veggies were fresh. Corn chowder soup had a good consistency and very flavorful. The unfried chicken had a good tenderness to it and nice texture on the breading. The squash and Brussel sprouts side dish was on point! Kale and cranberry salad had a nice touch with the pickled onions and good balance with the vinaigrette. Sweet potato fries cooked to perfection, very tasty with the aioli. I will get this again for sure, soon! And it's healthy! And i like that they use biodegradable togo boxes and cutlery!! Yes!!"}
{"text":"Decided I would pick up dinner to go and needed a healthy option-this place delivered!  Not sure why so many people had bad reviews I loved this place!

You come in and pick whatever type of menu you would like to eat from i.e. vegan, vegetarian etc and order.  Placed the to go order for the brussel sprouts & squash, quinoa crunch wrap, artichokes, and the tal grain bowl (all off the vegan menu) sit at the counter and your order is ready to go in 15 minutes!

My husband and I loved everything and felt it had good really good flavor especially the artichokes and brussel sprouts.  Yes it is pricey but good clean unprocessed healthy food costs more!

Will definitely be back! My only wish is that the is one in the southwest part of town!"}
{"text":"We used Lyfe kitchen as a caterer for our wedding at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. We had been looking for something tasty, and healthy. And in a sea of just.. uggg.. expensive crap... we came across they Lyfe site and got excited.

We contacted them, and they were very attentive, responsive, and friendly. They were just starting their catering arm, but told us they would be on top of it.

The day of they delivered it to us.. we took it up... and  we were shocked by how good the food was! All of the guests were raving about it. The Grain bowl, the steak, and the chicken with Brussel sprouts were the stand out hits.  ALL the food was great!

(also, their Pom-ginger lemondae makes a great mixer, just add whiskey or vodka.

This place is great... We fed 60 people for only 900 dollars, (with 4 pans still full left over.) The food is healthy, tasty, and inexpensive. So if you need catering for a wedding / event that is GOOD.. try them out!"}
{"text":"The food is extraordinary the atmosphere is soothing and the people were welcoming and very friendly. I could eat there everyday if I could. I just had an amazing time sitting indoors as well as outdoors."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today with a friend and both of our selections were delicious! I ordered the Quinoa Crunch Wrap & my friend ordered the Barramundi Noodle Bowl.  I cannot recall the name of the LYFE water I chose, but it had a spiced apple flavor and was delicious! The staff was attentive, friendly and professional. 
I am excited to go back and try another menu item. 
Only concern I have is the restaurant space is very large and it wasn't busy enough at prime lunch time to fill it.  Hope they are profitable enough to keep such a large space open."}
{"text":"Being located in the district comes with certain expectations. It better be nice, it better be good AND you are probably going to pay a little more.

LYFE Kitchen meets all 3 criteria. 

The wife and I have come here a couple of times now. The food is good and healthy. There are ample choices however unlike some other places they dont have calories listed. They have a nice selection of items though. I liked the burger choices. 

Also, they give you an option of sparkling, ambient and ice water! Perfect for me and perfect for her!"}
{"text":"I rarely get out to Henderson and was very excited to try this place.  I really wanted to love it but after our experience, it was a major disappointment.  The food itself isn't bad, though the portions are small and they use \"gardein,\" which is fine but once again, the portions are small for the price and it's sliced very thin.  I did enjoy the veggies that came with the scallopini - at least what I ate of them.  The first time my dish was brought out, we found a white hair underneath the scallopini.  We called the manager over, he picked up the hair, held it up to the light, looked at it then looked at me and kind of smirked! He then started walking away with the plate then stopped and asked if we wanted another one, which we did - hair isn't pleasant in food but hey, it happens.  When the second dish was brought out, he told us, \"I checked it, no hair.\"  So I proceeded to eat again and low and behold, ANOTHER WHITE HAIR.  We called over a food runner and she picked up the hair, rolled it between her fingers, and let it fall to the floor.  She then said she would tell, \"Jerry.\"  We saw her speak to someone other than the person who took away our dish the first time but he never approached us.  The first manager came back to us, apologized and said he checked everyone and couldn't find anyone with that kind of hair (I'm thinking it could have been someone who prepped earlier in the day since it was in the veggies both times).  He then offered us a gift card for the amount of the dish.  By now, I had lost my appetite and knew that I would not be coming back here.  We told him no thank you and that was that. He made no other effort to address the issue or even save the reputation of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow so bummed. 
Went in and got a fish taco after young lady at the counter said they were the resturants most popular diah.
It was yumm.
and then I got violently iLL, about 2 hours later. ( I did not have breakfast so that the fish taco was all I had in my belly).

Called to let them know they should pull the fish dish, no answer.
I wrote to them, but it said via Yelp they don't respond to messages...so how to warn the shop and other customers???  This is the only way sadly...

Such a nice place, clean and great menu. It was my first visit, and probably my last."}
{"text":"We love LYFE Kitchen and the staff is great as well!! It's suppe adorable and we literally come here once or twice a day.. the only complaint is that the cookies have gotten smaller and they are still the same price."}
{"text":"I like the feel of the place: clean and earthy. The seats inside are comfortable - they've mastered the lounge-looking seating but you don't feel like you're sinking in your seat or on a couch trying to eat your meal. I really like places with great outdoor seating as well, which they have.

I ordered the curry dish, which had great sauce flavor, but something about it was dry. I didn't feel quite satisfied with my order, but I'm convinced I ordered incorrectly for what I was hungry for at the time. My girlfriend ordered the fish noodle bowl and had to ask for more noodles because - I swear - there were about 5 on her plate, ha! She felt misled because they have pictures near the register to show you how the plates look, and it wasn't what she received. Her tastebuds were still happy with her order, though.

I will definitely try it again and hopefully update my rating, but for now, it's just a \"meh.\""}
{"text":"FOOD is GREAT, service is . Waited 20 min on a pick up order for a small vegetarian item that didn't include side or anything, plus they didn't include any utensils or napkins. If you have time, this place is great. If you're short on time, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"I went to Lyfe Kitchen for the first time today and placed an order to go. They asked us to have a seat and they would call our name. We waited-and waited-and waited. After the people that ordered after us were eating I asked about our order and WOW--it's right here! I'm sure it had been sitting there for at least 5 minutes. No apologies! It was lukewarm but fabulous! Seriously, some of the best food I've had! Next time, I'll eat in! BTW-there were only about 8 people in the restaurant. They weren't busy and we sat right in front of the counter."}
{"text":"This place was a favorite of mine, back when I lived in LA. I was so happy to see that they have a location close to where I live now. The Mahi mahi tacos are out of this world, and I love the chia water! There are so many things I want to try there... everything looks and sounds so good. 
Definitely a favorite spot to eat!"}
{"text":"LYFE Kitchen is very good and I love their Maui Maui tacos and sweet potato fries. Last week I ate their Art's un fried chicken and the kale and cranberry salad! Stuffed and so delish. It is a great place to have lunch. It can be a bit pricey at times. I love the very social and positive environment. The tea is fabulous and so is their amazing water! I love to have a healthy alternative that is yummy too!"}
{"text":"The food was really good, small portions and over priced.
8 Chips n guacamole with a Table Spoon of salsa was like 8 BUCKS? 
Wine by the half craft for a decent Cab was 24 BUCKS,I think thats a half bottle?
I got 3 pieces of Artichoke and some good dip for 10 BUCKS?
Then we had dinners that weren't as over priced but still expensive for standing in line ordering your own food. 
Im sure the quality of food is really good, but i won't be able to go back until they take food stamps.
(I don't really get food stamps)"}
{"text":"Terrible service! The first time I came I had a good experience but there wasn't one single person in the restaurant except for me and the workers. Today there were a total of five people eating there other than me and they messed up three times just on my simple order. I also overheard them apologizing to a girl sitting next to me about not bringing her order out correctly. After finishing my soup and being at the restaurant for 45 minutes without having my meal I just asked for a refund.  

So I order a burger with fries and soup. The first time I came here the soup came out right away and then the burger came out later. You know, the way that its supposed to be done. The five people in there must've really thrown the staff off or the idea I'm leaning more toward is that they're too lax and just didn't care to pay attention. After waiting more than 20 minutes and not getting my soup yet I walked up to the cashier and said \"I hope you guys aren't going to bring me everything all at once.\" The cashier said \"oh let me be sure they don't\", and walked back into the kitchen. 10 minutes later a waiter comes out with my soup and burger. Lol. I sent the burger back and asked him to please make me a new one that will come out when my soup is done. Then I finished my soup waited 10 minutes looking around wondering what was going on and finally had to get up and ask the manager where my burger was. I waited another five minutes and then I was over it. I don't care if the food tastes good, it's the principle. There's 100 places around here that taste good too and I'm not going to give my money to a place that has bad service. When I told the lady that appeared to be the assistant manager what happened she didn't really appear to care as she kept scrubbing the table in front of me and looking down at it rather than looking at me. Her body language was saying \"just go get your refund and get out of here\" lol. Really though.  There is a lady that appears to be the actual manager as I've seen her there before doing paper work and she was very nice. 

Unfortunately an apology isn't enough to make me want to give them my money again. No Lyfe kitchen for me. Hopefully that nice manager gets a little more assertive and snaps her crew into shape."}
{"text":"I'm from Santa Monica California, finally there's a place I can eat really good food and good for you. Santa Monica is full of wonderful vegan organic restaurant's. Went there yesterday with my husband we enjoyed everything we got, kale Caesar, chicken sandwich, unfried chicken and the chocolate mousse dessert, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious and healthy. I had the gluten-free burger and the sweet potato fries are to die for. Also love the hibiscus beat drink really refreshing. I must eat at!!"}
{"text":"Good place for your clean diet! A healthful people joint for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome local find in Henderson.  Not a ton of vegan options, but they are clearly marked, and many can be modified to be vegan.  The server was also a brand new vegan and excited to be there. 

I ordered the veggie burger with daiya and a side salad.  I had to wait a bit to eat later and reheat, so the food suffered a little, but it was still one of the best veggie burgers I've had anywhere (and I don't say that lightly).  

The place was nice and quiet, and service was quick. I don't plan to return to Henderson in a hurry, but if I do, I'll come here"}
{"text":"WHAT A SURPRISE! Had lunch here after voting on Tuesday and everything was quite, QUITE DEEEELISH! The restaurant is much larger than I expected, comfortable seating, nice floor layout/design.
    We ordered at the counter, then the servers deliver your order directly to your table~
 the grilled artichoke, sautéed squash & Brussel sprouts, (I don't care for Brussel sprouts, but the squash was very food!) mushroom & goat cheese flatbread plus a chicken wrap. Everything was just wonderful from the aioli dip for the artichoke, to the balsamic drizzle on the flatbread all just perfect. They do offer lots of kale, quinoa, gluten free & vegetarian options for those folks~
    Breakfast  looks very good also based on the menu. 
    Go by you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Lyfe kitchen is a great concept but I have to say the service is always slow and the staff seem pretty zoned out. I had the penne with mushroom, spinach & pesto- it was okay. Good enough for the day after drinking. A bit too salty. Had to spit out a couple of gristle/chewy chicken pieces. The Brussels & sweet potato w honey mustard are great! My friend had the breakfast wrap which is amazing (we both love it). I do love the water station, temperate or cold flat and cold seltzer (small bubbles too- not the big ones). The line to order food can be a bit long & the menu posted on the wall is not detailed. Otherwise You have to try and grab a menu from the counter which is rough when there is a line."}
{"text":"Very creative healthy menu, enjoyed the food and ambience of this Restaurant- would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Wow what a place for the healthy eater. Just love this restaurant. I highly recommend this place it is a must see and experience."}
{"text":"Always great food and service. Just need them to build one in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"This was first Tim e going to Lyfe Kitchen. As we walked in I didn't know what to expect but it was a very casual restaurant where you come in and order your food, sit and have your food brought to you. The food was AMAZING. Very flavorful and fresh. I had the chicken parmigiana sandwich with chips and salsa. I could of ate the chips and salsa all day they were so GOOD! the drink were great as well. I love try out healthy food spots and this might be on my top 1 places in Las Vegas. Great for a good lunch or dinner. Also they do have a kids menu and my daughter ate well. Grilled cheese, broccoli and edamame with oranges as well."}

{"text":"Had lunch at LYFE Kitchen yesterday - prior to going I checked out Yelp (cause that's how I roll!) and was prepared for the worse... Much to my surprise and happiness this place was wonderful! Great vibe, super clean, casual but inviting.

My 2 girlfriends and I arrived right at noon, there were a few people in line ahead of us, but not too busy- the counter service was outstanding! We found a table outside got situated with the water (serve yourself, 3 types - from a cool tap thingy... cold, sparkling and room temp). 

Our food came out pretty quick! I would say in less than 10 minutes-which is absolutely acceptable!

The food was delicious! I had the antipasto salad-the portion was perfect! My one gf had a GF flat bread, she was so excited to have a crispy GF bread plus so many GF options!!! My other friend had the margarita flat bread - both raved about taste and the portions were the right size - definitely not too small like so many reviewers complained about!! I paid $18 for my salad and one of the flatbreads... not bad considering the quality of the food. 

There are so many great options on the menu - can't wait to try something else - I'm a fan!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LYFE. this is my favorite restaurant in Henderson, BY FAR. I love it so much that I think it actually hurts me to read poor reviews about lyfe.

ambiance: LOVE. clean. bright. airy. modern. comfortable. perfect for work lunch, brunch with the girls, casual date. 
 
edamame hummus: i don't tend to like edamame hummus in general but decent.

sweet corn chowder: delicious. sweet and creamy, yet not too heavy. 

quinoa crunch bowl: healthy, crunchy goodness. i find that a lot of healthy foods often taste like individual raw ingredients thrown together but the flavors in the quinoa crunch bowl marry quite nicely

fish tacos: who doesn't love fish tacos? delicious. especially love the chayote slaw. adds a nice crunch and freshness

art's unfried chicken: LOVE. very filling. super healthy considering how it tastes. even love all the sides that come with it. excellent healthy alternative when you're craving something greasy

thai curry bowl: good. solid, but not terribly special, either

barramundi noodle bowl: I LOVE THIS DISH SO MUCH. i do think the \"noodle\" part of the description is misleading because it only comes with a couple strands of soba which don't add anything to the dish. the kimchi broth is actually quite good. yes, it's very watered down compared to an authentic kimchi stew but imparts enough flavor to give it the comfort food feel. always hits the spot. the barramundi has always been perfectly executed-light and buttery. 

chocolate budino: ok. this i don't love. the pomegranate chia seeds don't really go with the chocolate budino. and the budino tastes like chocolate jello pudding cups. not a fan. 

the prices aren't low but not unreasonable considering its location/venue/food. 

i love lyfe. hope we get more places like this in henderson!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.  Very clean and open.  Extremely professional and nice staff, and the food was great!  I had the edamame hummus and veggie plate and the fish tacos with a mint cucumber water.  Very fresh and great tasting food.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in at 6:45 pm, brought a friend & kids who hadn't tried LYFE before and I had suggested she try my 2 favorites- baked sweet potato fries and the corn chowder. Friend places order at the counter for those among a smoothie and cookies for her kid and pays. She was then told they were out of smoothies, and sweet potato fries and all other fries, and the chocolate chip cookies by a staffer. Then I order corn chowder and the Margherita flatbread. As the food arrives the runner tells me they are out of corn chowder. (After I paid?). Hard to believe for an early dinner service they were out of all fries, smoothies, cookies and now soup? We were disappointed for the kids and our experience."}
{"text":"Love that there is a clean, fresh and actually healthy fast food option in Henderson! The food is like I would make at home- maybe not the most flavorful, but its clean and good for you which is what counts!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, it's no longer around. Corporate needs to open a spot in Vegas. Open a location in Summerlin"}
{"text":"Seriously shocked, appalled, and  disappointed. 

I ordered a \"berry bowl\" for my staff from the catering menu ($35) and the staff was very kind and willing to help get my order done quickly which I very much appreciated. 

Upon opening the bowl, there were orange wedges and grapes beneath which were some strawberries, blackberries and a few blueberries and then three whole unpeeled unopened bananas. I found this to be distasteful, unsanitary, and embarrassing.  I would expect this from a low end grocer not from here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time with family for dinner and was not disappointed.  After placing our order, we chose to dine outside on the balmy Nevada evening.  The pomegranate ginger lemonade was absolutely delicious!  I had turkey meatloaf with quinoa, and it was so moist and flavorful (I skipped the topping.)  It was served alongside some freshly sautéed green beans, and a fabulous mashed cauliflower which put ordinary mashed potatoes to shame.  Healthy and delicious--what's not to love?"}
{"text":"I love this spot.

It's hard to find solid, healthy options that have plenty of options for everyone. LYFE has vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, and non- options, and everything I've tried is excellent. The vegan and veggie options are delicious enough to satisfy the carnivores as well. 

My personal favorites are the tacos (listed as fish, but available vegan w/ tofu, my go-to option) and the quinoa crunch bowl. Both are extremely flavorful, satisfying, and healthy. I also love their drinks. 

Every time I've been in, it's been fairly quiet, so I've always had a positive experience with the service. I've never had to wait very long at all for my items. You order at the counter and take a seat, and someone brings your items out to you. 

Great option for those who prefer healthier dining, or even those who don't!"}
{"text":"I dont always give 5 stars but when I do.. this place was fantastic.

It was clean and modern on the interior.
They have an elf you can find for a cookie.
They also offer check in freebies.
The cashier was very helpful and knew we were new there so she explained the menu to us. I went with a grilled chicken salad and was pleasantly surprised.
They also have a cucumber water that was yummy 

My ingredients in my salads were top notch. Living in the desert fresh veggies can be hit or
Miss and these were amazing life what I get in Hawaii or Tahiti. The chicken was grilled perfectly with spices and everything else was fresh fresh fresh.
There was a dressing that came with it but i used lemon instead and it really brought out all of the flavors nicely.

Try it you wont be sorry!"}
{"text":"LYFE is awesome! Seriously, I love that someone took a vegan / vegetarian idea and made it accessible to everyone. It is unique, fun, vibe-y, and really yummy. 

I've had the stir fry, the curry, and one of the flat breads. - all SUPER scrumptious! The atmosphere is fun. You order at the counter and then they bring out your food to your table. Water is self serve on a tap and you can choose from sparkling (although broken when I was there) ambient temperature or chilled. I love ambient and so this was a cool find! 

The chairs are comfortable, the patio is enjoyable and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. The restrooms are clean and the staff is super friendly and helpful! 

All the ingredients are of top notch quality and you can definitely taste that when you're eating! They even have beer and wine on tap! What's not to love about this place! 

I love coming here for lunch after golfing in the morning. It's such a great spot with AWESOME food. Check it out!! You wont regret it!"}
{"text":"We got here at 7:40pm, and ordered the Chicken, Mushroom, Spinach and Penne, and the Corn Chowder. I received my CMSP in about 10 minutes, it was pretty good, probably not worth the price but I liked it. My girlfriend waited for the CC but after 20 minutes it still didn't show, so I went to the counter to ask, the cashier said just one moment, she left and never came back. I went back to the table so my food wouldn't get cold. Another 10 minutes later and still no CC, I asked a server walking by and he said he would check. He didn't come back. A few minutes later another server walked by and he said he would check. About 5 minutes later a manager came to our table to explain that they were out of CC so they had to make more, and that it would be out in a few minutes, she gave us a Cucumber Mint Water for the wait. Neither of us liked it very much. We waited an entire hour from ordering for her CC to finally show up. My girlfriend liked the CC. Overall, the concept of this place is awesome, we need more healthy choices throughout the valley, and the food is pretty good. They just need to figure a way to server better and maybe they would have got a 4-star review from me."}
{"text":"Yes the portions are small and yes the kale salad tastes like... Kale salad.  But the buffalo chicken wrap was incredible.  I felt full but not stuffed after eating and the meal itself was good.  I would recommend this place, especially since the kids menu was also pretty great and my son loved what he ate."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food was great and the service was fast. I love the decor and the environment. Lots of options for gluten free, vegan and for everyone else. All the dishes are excellent."}
{"text":"This may be small, but it was a big deal to us. We arrived on a cold, cloudy rainy Saturday at  4:30 pm. We came for 1 thing (along with other meal choices). We both wanted their vegan sweet corn chowder made with cashew milk. They were out! We left ... disappointed.

It would seem to me that on a perfect \"hot soup day\", some better planning could have been performed.

Not the best."}
{"text":"Located in the same shopping center as Whole Foods, next to Settebello -- you can't miss it!

Pretty busy, modern, comfortable feel when you walk in.

Items ordered :
- Hibiscus Beet LYFE Juice : hibiscus-y, beet-y palette cleanser!
- Quinoa Crunch Wrap : small, but very filling! Quinoa, crunch veggies, avocado, edamame, and hummus wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla. Comes with their hot sauce on the side, adds the kick without really adding the burn! 

I ordered to-go, but it was a quick and painless wait. Also the employees were very helpful and patient with me because we thought they served breakfast all day, come to find out breakfast ends at 11am and had to re-ask my coworker what she wanted. 

Like the fresh, healthy, gluten-free, vegetarian concept! 
Lots to choose from the menu so def will have to make a trip back if I'm needing a healthy fix! A-OK in my books!"}
{"text":"Man I love this place.. The atmosphere is cool. Food is delicious. If you're in Henderson give them a try. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"There is LYFE in the District! I stopped in for a girls lunch at LYFE.  I had heard many things about it and was excited to give them a try.  

You walk into a bright and open dining area.  Everything was so clean and airy.  They even have their fresh herbs growing near the registers. There are several menus by the front.  I like how they split up menus for those who want gluten free or vegan.  Otherwise there is an 'Everything' menu which is great for me.  Service was very professional, polite and friendly.  I appreciated the fact of employees coming by during our meal to check on how things were.  :-)

I chose the fish tacos and sweet corn chowder.  The tacos were filled with grilled mani, chayote slaw, avocado, cilantro, chipotle aioli surrounded by corn tortillas.  The fresh salsa on the side had a wonderful flavor that really complimented the tacos.  The corn chowder was so delicious!  I loved every bite and it came in a big bowl. I would definitely get that again.

Overall this is a great place for healthy eating in the District area.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"First time at this place. I ordered the Mahi fish tacos and they were delicious. The service was outstanding. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere. The employees were very friendly. The location is also in a good place. I will definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time today. We weren't sure what to expect as it is known as a \"healthy restaurant\". I have to say we were blown away by the food. We swapped out the kale and carrot salad for a simple side salad with Cesar dressing and it was the best dressing I've ever had! I don't think I've ever liked a salad until now. I had the fish tacos and he had the grass fed burger. Both came out quick and were delicious. We will become regulars here soon and plan on taking my mother-in-law who has a gluten allergy because of the options. The only negative is the price, but for the quality of the food it should be expected."}
{"text":"First of all, the place is easy to find and plenty of parking.  There was a variety of selections on the menu.  The food was delicious and I loved the infused cucumber mint water!  The people are friendly and helpful.  I loved how clean and bright the place was.  Plenty of tables and the place seems to be very popular.  Lots of people came in for lunchtime."}
{"text":"Tuesday 7/11

I placed an order at 10am for 10:25am pickup on Yelp's Eat24 and it was confirmed.

I show up at Lyfe Kitchen at 10:25am and found the doors to be locked. There are employees inside but no sign and no one answering any questions. 

10 minutes later, I get a call from Eat24 and they said they finally got in contact with Lyfe Kitchen Management and they said the breakfast menu/hours have been discontinued. 

Note to management: this was not the best way to handle the change. Next time, please inform your partners ahead of time. And, have an employee or sign our front apologizing to guests or at least explaining what's going on."}
{"text":"So sad, the only thing I really liked here was their quinoa buttermilk with blueberries pancakes and the last visit I was left wondering if they changed the recipe. There wasn't much quinoa in it.  That's the problem here, consistency. Also gone was the Hibiscus Beet LYFE water... boo. The place was pretty dead too. Like the Lyfe was sucked out of it. 

Fast forward three months later.
Came by for breakfast but guess what? Not only do they not serve breakfast anymore during the week, they open later now at 11am.

My last review I did say this place was really two stars, saving grace was their breakfast hours but now that's 86'd, I'm moving on from here. Bye!"}
{"text":"I love the looks of the restaurant inside and out. Herb garden is an added cool bonus. This place has lots of employees working at once, it seems like they have a system down. You walk in and order your food and sit down and wait for them to deliver it to you. 

On to the food, the first time I went I got the Quinoa Crunch Bowl. I ate it at the restaurant and was very impressed with the salad. It had perfect flavors that all went together so well and I would have given this place 5 stars. I loved the dressing, everything about this salad was just what I love. 

I went back once and ordered the same thing and got it to go and it was missing arugula from the salad and they replaced it with some other lettuce. Wish they would have told me because it sucked with romaine. Not the same! In addition, I added on salmon. Ohhh so sad salmon, it was cut up into a canned tuna like size, crisped and cooked so much that it tasted like salmon jerky bits on top of the salad. It was so bad that I had to go back and show them my salad and how pathetic it looked. When you hear grilled salmon, you think a piece (one piece not broken up bits) or a nice grilled salmon. If it was salmon chunks that were overcooked and sitting out all day, I wish I would have known. 

I decided to give it one more chance. I really loved that bowl and wanted it to be good as the first time, got it to go and it was in a different packaging which the top would not stay closed and one fast sudden stop at a red light and my salad fell and it was all over the floor of my car!! So much for good packaging for to go orders :( sad me!

Finally the last straw was eating there with my hubby. He got a burger which was very small and the side portion of fruit was hmmm toddler size? Very small. Of course I got my favorite salad and it had a fly on it. Enough said."}
{"text":"Obsessed. Clean healthy meals that are flavorful ! Fast service for dine in. Fresh. Love the Mahi taco, quinoa crunch bowl, garlic parm sweet potato fries and their lyfe waters. Basically everything is bomb. The end."}
{"text":"Went with a friend to sample dishes from this new establishment.  I had the garlic cheese sweet potato - arrived warm, soggy, and greasy. Dipping sauce was tasty. 
Then I had their Kale Caesars salad - arrived cool, crisp and tasteless. Dressing was not to my liking. To another palate, the blandness of the dressing might be fine. Salad itself had a mix if broccoli florets, lettuce stems, kale leaves, and since I included chicken. Chicken was skinless, breast, cubed, grilled and dry.
I also ordered the chicken wd penne and mushrooms and spinach.  Again,  it is a sauce my palate is not used to. So for me, it was bland and flavorless. Recipes probably used the vegan version of mayonnaise or cream. 
If one eats enough of this type of cuisine,  the palate will get used to it.
But for me,  I shall not be returning. 
My friend's fish tacos were tasty. Dressing on the side salad was tart and clean tasting. The salsa was also seasoned differently,  but good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this for a really long time. 
The decor is really nice. And the bathrooms are super clean. That was the best part. That's it. 
$45 for a sub-par food. Was, disappointing. To say the least. My mom's burger was not seasoned. The sweet potato fries were bland and soggy (sorry, even tho they were baked. They shouldn't be soggy). 
My flat bread with mushrooms and goat was ok. The unfried chicken my daughter had was bland and sad. And my 5 yr old had a flat bread pizza and eat the first bite and left everything on the plate but the fruit. 
My mom liked the ginger pom lemonade. But i hated my regular lemonade 
I wanted to love this place, so i didnt say a word. But as soon as we got to the car, both my mom and my daughter said they are not coming back."}
{"text":"The place itself is beautiful.  Nice modern decor with a feel of natural! They even have their own indoor garden! - then the menu is awesome.....they have all kinds of options for vegans, and people with allergies like myself.........huge GF menu!.
I ordered a GF grass fed burger with baked garlic parmesan sweet potato fries and a ginger mint chia water that was mmmm AMAZING! - I REALLY enjoyed my meal, it was tasty and healthy and very reasonably priced.  It will definitely be one of my favorite places in town from now on! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Love lyfe!! Really good food and pretty good price for a health food type place. The inside of the restaurant is really trendy, you order at the counter seat yourself and then they bring you your food. 

They have separate gluten free and vegan menus. I think every meal is under 600 calories so the portions aren't huge, might not be enough for some men but if you want something a little heartier go with a burger or the chicken avocado sandwich is REALLY good. 

I really love the chicken dish with butternut squash, whatever the sauce is is superb! Also love the ginger mint chia water.

Staff is super friendly and accommodating, service is quick!"}
{"text":"This place was super cute, the staff was very friendly. I love how they have sparkling, ambient, and chilled water on tap and you can serve yourself. I had the power greens salad with roasted salmon and it was divine!!"}
{"text":"Clean interior.  Healthy menu.  Menu items are rather pricey.  I like the play on words.  LYFE stands for Love Your Food Everyday.  Sweet Corn Chowder and Chicken, Mushroom, & Spinach Penne, with a glass of Cucumber Mint water was what I ordered.  The Cucumber Mint water was very refreshing.  Food was a little slow coming out, but once it did, my unhappiness with the speed of service disappeared.  The chowder was absolutely delicious and my pasta dish was on point!  I will definitely be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"My friends are vegetarians and simply rave about this place. We've eaten lunch here with them on several occasions. Each time I order fish tacos. You get two tacos for 10 bucks . You can add a third for another $2.50 .  For me,  two are filling enough for lunch . They are excellent. The fish is succulent. The veggies in the taco with the fish are tasty. It comes with a salsa on the side that adds a bit of spice if you want it. As a side I got the garlic parmesan sweet potato fries. Unfortunately they were brought to my table cold. However that didn't stop me from eating every last one of them and loving it. 
The ambience is a typical Lyfe kitchen setting .  Very clean.  A large screen TV on the wall .  Self-service water  with an option for  sparkling water  if you like . 
It's hard to comment about the service since this is basically a self service restaurant. You walk up to the counter and order when you first come into the restaurant. A waiter will come and bring you the food when it's ready. And they do come and clean your dirty dishes when you're done eating. For a self service restaurant, the service is as good as can be expected. No complaints here.
A very enjoyable lunch for under $15. Such a deal!"}
{"text":"A bright, sun-filled dining room with an herb garden, cozy patio seating, AND a healthy menu?! They even include calorie counts, gluten free, and vegan options. What's not to love? Read on, y'all.

QUINOA CRUNCH WRAP, $9 and half the size of a standard water bottle. That was a bit irritating. Took my first bite and pulled out a gigantic piece of broccoli that took up a third of the filling. Flavors, after that point, were tasty, and I really enjoyed the fireman's spicy sauce, but... at $9, I'd have to talk myself into getting it again.
Added on a $4 side of roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet potato, some of my favorite vegetables. They were beautiful. But had no flavor, aside from the crunch of roasting. Maybe I'm spoiled by the honey-sriracha and heavy-handed garlic versions I make at home, but these had no seasoning whatsoever. There was a visible hollandaise-looking sauce on the dish, but it was flavorless.

 For a $14 lunch, I was full and I actually really liked the flavors of the wrap...but they need to hang out with my friends Salt & Pepa a little bit more. Wish the location was closer to me, I'd be interested in giving their fish tacos a try."}
{"text":"This place has the best options if you're looking for tasty healthy food! They add a twist to ordinary food that makes the food appealing and delicious. I've been to other places and this place has the best menu by far. One of my favorites is their Edamame Dip (they've taken this off the menu but you can still order it)."}
{"text":"Not happy and impressed with the customer service. The lady who took our order was not friendly. She was very stoic and did not give any kind of emotions when I told her it is our first time to eat at their establishment. We were expecting to get change back after we paid but she made us feel as though we should have not wanted our change back and leave it as tip. Again, as a customer, I would like to make that decision of leaving a tip or not. This is not a place where a waiter took our orders from our table. It's a pay-first-and-order-first-before-you-sit- then- have-your-food-delivered  style restaurant. The food is mediocre. The breakfast burrito that I ordered, I could have made at home with better ingredients and garnishes. They did not even provide us with a spoon to stir our coffees. We had to use a knife to do that. They did not bring the creamer as well, we had to ask for it! The service lacked. It is not polished and thorough. I have eaten in establishments that are less la-di-da than this with stellar service but this place under delivered what they had the community expect. This is not a place that I will recommend to out of town visitors and even to locals for a uniquely great dining experience."}
{"text":"You walk in and have 4 different menus: everyone, gluten-free, vegan/vegetarian, alcohol/drinks, you pick your menu, look at what you want and order and pay. You go pick your seat either in the aesthetically appealing modern/ dining area or outside on a nice patio. Then they bring you your drinks, water is self serve on a water bar, and then they bring out your food.

Had the grass-fed steak and potatoes with grilled onions and a side salad and camomile tea. Superb!! The steak was juicy and amazing, the potatoes and grilled onions were perfect! The side salad had a lemon something dressing so I didn't really like the dressing to much but it was a beautiful salad. 

The service was as you expected for this type of 'restaurant' which was fine and they were really nice. If I could critique anything is that I only had enough water for one cup of tea... 

I love this place! Definitely recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Well dont come here if you are in a hurry cauae it takes forever.  I ordered a quick vegie rice dish and half hour later and still nothing.  Probably because i ordered to go and didnt leave a tip.  People came in after me and ordered and had their doos first.   Not going back to this place.  Not customer friendly."}
{"text":"Very nice place, food looks good and also taste good but not great. It's a bit bland but prefer this healthier alternative  to the usual lunch spots around town."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Always fresh and delicious. Only reason 4 stars is because sometimes the service is very lax and the food come out on the colder side because they aren't on top of it."}
{"text":"I will definitely be eating here again. The food was a little expensive but man it was worth it. I came in after work to pick up some to go and it was fast and yummy. I am excited to try some other menu items!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I even have discovered foods that as a kid I hated but now as an adult love.  It is all in how food is prepared.  Have never had a bad thing. Love the waters, Brussel sprouts, wraps etc.. gets a but busy during peak times, but I even had my food to go once and ate outside at a nearby park.. Try this place.. it is great"}
{"text":"I love this place. There's something on the menu for everyone. Offering a gluten free, vegan and regular menu that shows the caloric content of each item, you can feel healthy ordering anything on the menu. 

My personal favorite item is the quinoa crunch bowl with tofu. It sounds light but I can't finish that thing if my life depended on it. And that's how all the items on the menus are. Everything will fill and satisfy without over filling. 

Not to mention the food is great."}
{"text":"Very good and healthy food. Nice comfy environment with friendly employees. I had the accent grains stir fry and it was very good, along with the hummus plate, quesadilla, and the buffalo chicken wrap. Everything that we had was very good."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great staff! I dine there every chance I get and always bring my friends and family."}
{"text":"I took my food to go. Service was great. Food was delicious. I got the tacos and my fiancé got the crispy chicken. Overall a nice spot would go back. Only criticism is for their portions are too small for the price of their food."}
{"text":"Love coming here. One of my two favorite spots with a Manager named David who's simply a Gem! Service here is professional prompt and clean! They ran out of an item and David went thru a lot to make it happen for the meal. Fantastic!! Five stars on food service and pricing. Make the trip and come eat here"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with eating at LYFE! They have Daily specials and a menu that caters to various diets. They have regular, vegan, and gluten free choices. 

We love the unfried vegan buffalo wings. I enjoy the vegan chicken sandwich, salads, and the quinoa bowl. The chia waters are a delicious drink!  My wife loves the  banana kale smoothie.

FYI, they have wine and beer as well. My wife has had the salmon here and she loves it! 

If you have dietary restrictions for anyone in your party, this is the place to go.  Great menu variety, adult beverages, and vegan dessert!"}
{"text":"What happened? I ordered the salmon tomato roasted plate. The salmon came with a sauce that tasted like tomato paste or soup, and hard vegetables. The salmon was great, but when I first had this dish I fell in love with it. The salmon was cooked perfectly, the sauce tasted homemade, and I had grilled vegetables. I basically paid $15 to eat one piece of salmon, not a meal. I use to love this place because price wise for healthy food, it's not that bad. Last time I had the vegan breakfast wrap is was just ok as well and it use to be awesome. O well...."}
{"text":"Yum, shakalaka! 
I have been here 4 times now and its slowly making its way into a regular stand by place when I just don't feel like cooking. 

For me it meets the 3 main reasons I  going anywhere to eat: 
The food tastes good. Check
Makes something I won't bother with at home. Check
Is healthy. Check

Once I got a hang of the ordering system I really liked this place."}
{"text":"1st time here and how great is this place? Where do I begin, a terrific staff and clever set up.Still and sparkling water on tap, we all loved that. Outdoor seating with umbrellas and misters , another plus, and the menu was a unique offering of many delights. Non fried chicken strips, hummus plate, kale Ceasars that we added Mahi to, awesome. The young lady that brought our food was so pleasant,  I did not get her name but she had dark hair and aqua blue eyes, great smile too. We came in after the gym, see you again soon."}
{"text":"stopped in the minute I spotted the place. fake chicken burger was fabulous. Fish tacos were a bit over baring  .  Salad was a waste of time. cucumber, mint water was very good. However there were no prices so the total was a shock! Not sure I'll go back"}
{"text":"A little pricey but totally worth it. The food is always delicious and makes you feel good after eating it. The staff are friendly and the setting is great. One of our favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! It's hard to find good Vegan food and this is amazing! There were so many choices that looked good I couldn't decide. My friend got the flatbread pizza which was very good and I had the quinoa crunch wrap and artichokes for starters.  My friend was disappointed there was no soda which I thought was a good thing!  We'll definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Love LYFE Kitchen! A friend and I were meeting here for lunch and found out they permanently CLOSED this location as of today. I was just here the other day. So bummed."}
{"text":"Healthy, fresh, and reasonably priced. I always make this a stop when I come to Henderson!!"}
{"text":"Please don't tell me to wait 10 minutes to order lunch I find it annoying! luckily there's a whole foods in the same shopping center. Bad experience especially when you have your mind set on something! Thanks Lyfe kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"Wow...Great choices for all the people who have a hard time eating out. Lyfe kitchen has a great atmosphere, friendly people + excellent food! With separate menus for vegan, gluten free & everyone else! Great place for the entire family. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this place. A little expensive, but usually worth it. Favorite are the sweet potato fries, the quinoa crunch wrap and the turkey burger.  Only complaint is that I did an online order and had someone pick it up for me because I was supposed to stay in bed all day,  and they didn't give me my drinks. Paid $6.00 for two lemonades I didn't receive."}
{"text":"I love this place! We go probably once a week and I'm never disappointed. There food is healthy and the portions are a good size. I've tried a bunch of different things here and there isn't a dish I don't like! The employees are also great, they are helpful and have great customer service. Customer service is one of the things that keeps me going back!! Good job Lyfe Kitchen!"}
{"text":"I order delivery through uber eats quite often. It's always delicious. This time I opted to try to curry noddles... oh my goodness! From the presentation all the way to the last bite it was phen"}
{"text":"Came here last week for dinner and was quite disappointed.  When we placed the order I asked how long an order of chicken fingers takes to cook. We have a toddler who was very hungry. We were told not long since they weren't busy. Well our food came out but no chicken fingers for the baby!!!!  After around 20 minutes I went in to check and they still weren't ready. They finally came a few minutes later. Very annoying. We probably would've just gone to whole foods for something quick if they were honest."}
{"text":"Quinoa crunch bowl is perfection. My mouth waters just at the thought of it. Refreshing atmosphere and friendly customer service. Please open a location in Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is beautiful and well done, very fresh. The menu options are really well portioned and healthy. There are plenty vegetarian and gluten free options.

I have been here numerous times and have tried very hard to like it. The main downfall is the logistical issues with food service and breakfast/lunch hours. Breakfast stops sharply at 11, despite the person in front of you taking 20 minutes to order a juice. So if you're in line, be prepared with multiple options. Sometimes the management walks the queue with updates on what they are out of. Lately it's been eggs and potatoes, despite these being ingredients in many menu items. It's very disappointing.

Customer service folks are super nice and well uninformed, but they lack the resources to succeed since kitchen to table service is slow and the electronic table markers do not work. Servers pace the whole restaurant with your food, asking random guests what their number or order was.

I want this beautiful place to work, but you need a lot of patience and time to go here."}
{"text":"I was super happy to try this place.  There is a great feel when you walk in the door and the menu screams \"healthy but ALSO tasty\".
Fish tacos with a side of brussel sprouts and sweet potatoes.  Silly me thinking I would need a side dish.  The tacos were plenty on their own but the veggies were so good I couldn't help myself.  I generally only like brussle sprouts if they are crispy-like almost charred crispy but all be damned if there's weren't the tastiest I have had.  I don't know how they prepared them-steamed maybe? But there was no crunch and all of the flavour.  The sweet potatoes were super good too.  It was so much food that my friend polished it off for me.  
My twin ordered the steak salad and wasn't as pleased.  The steak was good but some of the salad filler was a little weird texturally and we couldn't quite figure out what it was.  
I'm excited to go back and try breakfast.  Definitely going to make this a stop when I am in the Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is fresh with flavor.   Drinks are refreshing.  Vegan and vegetarian menu has a solid selection.  Great decor, which gives a wonderful feel to the experience."}
{"text":"The orange ginger chia water is delish! I ordered the salmon it was very juicy! My boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken burger with avocado, lets just say i kept taking bites randomly when he wasn't looking. Cant wait to try new things."}
{"text":"All the food I've gotten here has been amazing, the flavors are incredible. I've not been disappointed with anything I've tried. The service However, could use some help. It's more like the girls are all here to hang out with each other rather than serve customers. I'm always ignored when I come in, and stand at the counter for at least two minutes or more before someone even acknowledges or tried to help. They know very little about the menu and the way things are made, or what they're made with, and that's frustrating if you have a strict nutrition plan. There is one lady in particular who is just flat out rude, But the food is still good so we'll just stick with ordering take-out!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here since last summer... every time I had gone back then left me a bit...unimpressed. Lyfe Kitchen has good food and a pretty good quality of ingredients. The cafe is always clean. But, no one there seems to care about the food they are serving. The staff is mostly young girls that seem to care more about fashion, their eye make up, and who is making the starbucks run vs giving good, sincere, professional service. The service really is lacking. 
I did notice the menu had more vegan options and I ordered the black bean burger and the chocolate mousse parfait. Both were good. I'd [possibly return occasionally for a change up in the meals out rotation  but the place doesn't have my heart..."}
{"text":"The food is super healthy and very very good, so good we've been here 4 times this week for lunch.
Today I had a server by the name of \"Sara\" who went the extra mile and brought a side of fruit to make up for something I wasn't fond of. Thanks Sara !"}
{"text":".. BLOWN. AWAY.

I've been dying to try restaurants around the valley with exceptional vegan/vegetarian options and I finally have been able to do so tonight!

Lyfe has an amazing selection to suit EVERYONES needs .. offering several different vegan/vegetarian/gluten free dishes.. NOT TO MENTION - A MUCH HEALTHIER OPTION THAN MOST PLACES WILL OFFER!!

My boyfriend had the tofu tacos w/ side of chips and salsa
- Tacos were delicious - amazing flavor .. the sauce on them was so good &tofu was great!!
- Salsa was okay - chips were flavored &great but mostly broken up pieces and not many at all.

I had the curried rice noodles - packed with tons of veggies and a nice spicy kick .. needed a little extra S+P but other than that - awesome dish!!

We also shared the brussels and squash - whatever sauce that came with them was also outstanding and I loved the roasted flavor from the veggies!!

Great atmosphere - comfy booths and even had the Yankee game on .. YUP - I'LL BE BACK!!

Thank you LYFE for a HEALTHY meal!"}

I have been here three times and have tried different dishes and they were so good, fresh and so healthy for you, it is vegetarian friendly and u get that good feeling in your stomach when you walk out. The staff are friendly and I have not had one bad customer service and as u can see from my other reviews that I am all about customer service first and then the food of course, so trust me on this one."}
{"text":"loved finding this on a 107 degree day.. they have lots of refreshing beverage/smoothie options... AND a sparkling water dispenser on tap (includes room temp water and vegas water) it was a goldmine finding this to refill my water bottle! I mean, its not glacier fresh but 30% better than vegas water on tap...which I could not drink... bllah!

back to the menu, it reminds me of veggie grill but healthier.. I shared a mahi mahi salad, kale smoothie and a side of brussels/squash with the hubs.

nice and light and they have wifi and lots of tables. Very clean, nutritious and highly recommend going to whole foods next door for some fruit/coffee for the road!"}
{"text":"The sauces are my favorite here. They're full of natural flavor and not heavy. Best for lunch in my opinion. It' s quality food so you don't feel heavy going to back to the office after lunch. YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! 

Located in the same center as Whole Foods at the District. They have plenty of healthy vegetarian (and carnivore) options! My favorite is the roasted brussel sprouts & butternut squash side! The sauce is so yummy, and I've had it multiple times now! The edamame hummus, crispy chicken, and quinoa crunch salad are also good! They have weekend brunch and surprisingly good black coffee. I definitely recommend this place, especially if you're looking for healthy food, don't want to sacrifice on taste, and great service!"}
{"text":"A big fan of the chicken avocado sandwich. Barre3 is across the parking lot, so I come here after every workout to make myself fee better/healthier. I like that they have the calories listed, but I really dislike that all the 'meals' are individual - you always have to order sides separately. No combo options (my reason for 3 stars)"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I typically eat more \"junky\" foods but trying to turn over a new leaf! AND they have entrées that are healthy but still taste good!  I love the QUINOA CRUNCH BOWL and the FLATBREADS are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Today I was at whole foods market and decided to give this place a try for lunch. 

The appearance to the place is really cool. Decorated clean and modern. I enjoyed the \"herb garden\" in the middle. Literally tons of fresh herbs that you could (although I don't recommend) pick off and eat. 

The cashiers were super friendly and helpful. Some of the other team members seemed to be a little pissed off. Overall, the people I spoke directly with were great.

I got a to go order of a crunch bowl with tofu. I also got a mint cucumber lyfe water. 
The water was refreshing. I'd probably get a different one if I go again though, it wasn't like super spactacular. The bowl I got was good. The tofu was delish. The hummus and quinoa was really fresh and tasty. Lots of fresh veggies. The hot sauce that comes with it though...I found it a little strange. It just had an odd flavor and I didn't feel it went well with the salad. I'm glad I decided not to pour it over the entire thing.

Overall, a good experience. I'll be back to try more stuff.)5"}
{"text":"Okay, I love this place, it always helps that I can walk to it, it also helps the two people I have introduced to it, loved it as well.

Farmhouse Burger - for those times you want a burger and do not want to regret it an hour later. ;) I've had this delivered to my house (I know I was super lazy) and I've eaten it in the restaurant. Its just as good either way!
- whole wheat ciabatta, great meat and you can have cheddar, vegan, goat or mozzarella cheese on it. I went with goat, nom!

Oh and the Garlic Parmesan Fries (Sweet Potato) are a fantastic addition to the burger.

Previous trips I've had the Roasted Mushroom and Goat Cheese Flatbread, which had a tone of flavor, and the Edamame Hummus Plate which was perfect for sharing and snacking, delicious and fresh.

I also always go for their Cucumber and Mint water, very refreshing."}
{"text":"Great food!

Vegas has been in desperate need of a restaurant like this forever. Thank god it has finally arrived."}
{"text":"All the food was ok but the service was not good at all.

This was our first time trying Lyfe Kitchen so we ordered the \"Classic Breakfast\", \"Spinach & Avocado Frittata\" \"Quinoa Buttermilk Pancakes\" and coffee.

Frittata lacked flavor and needed salt. The home fries were soggy. Classic Breakfast was a small portion. Pancakes were delicious tho!

We sat on the patio and no one checked on our table AT ALL the entire meal. I mentioned this to the girl behind the counter TWO different times I brought my coffee cup up for a refill.

We sat chatting for a about 30min, drinking coffee with dirty dishes on the table. I was really curious to see if anyone, at any point, would clear the table. No one ever showed up.

Won't be back because of the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC food! This place is fast, healthy, convenient and the edamame hummus is amazing! Just GO!"}
{"text":"Another great spot for my Recovery Meal after a day at the Lake training or out in Henderson. I heard few mix reviews about LYFE but as in reading never judge book by its cover or get your own opinion before passing judgement My first impression was love the interior design has positive zen vibe. Then the first thing stands out (the oversize forks inside and outside) you see the fresh herbs display rows not just one and thinking healthy/organic restaurant. The colors very earth tomes all around especially with the one guess artwork green hill vast open landscape. Cool wall. Surprise once you looking at the menus (right not all healthy have gluten free, vegetarian, and regular) not all catered hardcore healthy but universal. I like that option! One thing that found interesting for the better or worst not sure since am caffeine addict. They do not serve soda......Thankfully recovery meal so perfectly good with water. Water is Awesome! Who serves water on TAP and all in nice water station area that think just for servers. They have cold, like warm, and sparkling water all on tap. They have lemons on the side  can add. The fresh lemonade was phenomenal! I tried my friend hibiscus beet lemonade was off the charts, and the ginger pomegranate not so much little tart for me. They also have regular lemonade. I like bold statement that say all things healthy and even step up with beverage not soda fountain or nothing. I wonder if get dirty look if you brings in your own soda. Lol!

It was my first time ordered two dishes. The edamame hummus and vegetables. BY far the best Hummus had in long time. The best thing about it is not made with traditional chix peas but mostly edamame beans. I always been fan of edamame beans. It side dish always look forward on AYCE sushi nights. I never thought about it for Hummus. The consistency was unreal off the charts, the seasonings they put in it brought it all together, and not even started on the vegetables served with it. OMG. Not only do not get cheated on this dish. The amount of vegetables from the broccoli, radish, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, edamame, and pita triangles (long think ones). Not only covered the whole huge round plate. Every single vegetable is SOOO on point! It taste fresh like from farmers market, the radish and cucumbers not fan of raw both crispy and nice snap/bite every one, both the broccoli and radish not same but color bright green nothing brown or old about it, and the pita triangles toasted perfect plus well seasoned on one side. Not vegetarian but this dish will make you ONE. I could ordered two orders be in total vegetarian bliss.

The crispy garden chick'n sandwich. I thought was solid sandwich. Nothing really wow me except the oatmeal bun. That was WoW for me. The side salad that came with the sandwich was fabulous. I like the thought of refreshing salad for lunch with sandwich. It decent little portion and the dressing some kind of vinaigrette was tasty. 

The service was good. You go up to the counter order and then they bring the food out. 

I see myself coming back here more often with more training days out at the Lake or near the Multi Generation Center. I love the diversity of the menu. I look forward the next tasty sample off the menu."}
{"text":"Some vegan friends brought me to this restaurant.  I have thee most unhealthy eating habits ever and would not choose this style of food. 

Fish tacos in a wheat wrap.  Very clean fresh crunchy.  Comes with a side of salad.  It was overall good. Very light.  I am a really skinny and petite girl, I was still hungry after eating this. 

The cucumber mint was so refreshing liked it a lot. 

I would suggest this to those who are health conscious or looking for something light and healthy.  Clean restaurant happy interior.  The gentleman who was wiping down tables and keeping everything tidy was super friendly and chit chatting with many patrons.  Very nice."}
{"text":"Great food - great atmosphere- great service. They offer a nice allergy - friendly and healthy yet delicious menu even the kiddos or your picky teen will enjoy! You have to try the Sweet Potato Fries! Don't forget to read the Lyfe Quotes! The outdoor patio dining area is clean and quaint. 
Thank you!"}
{"text":"I give Lyfe kitchen 1 star and quite frankly I am over this place. Compared to Greens & Protiens and Protein House I am very disappointed. The idea of healthy food to go is basically how I eat everyday as I am a business owner always on the go. I will say I loved the Ginger Mint Lemon Chia Water but they serve it in a lil 10 oz cup for like 4-5$ ? I asked if they had bigger to-go cups and they said they don't have them? I also tried to order breakfast and they told me breakfast was over 10 minutes ago. ? This place has a full kitchen & they should serve breakfast all day....? I drove 20 minutes to eat breakfast there and it was over ?? What is this McDonalds ?? Carls Jr.? Ridiculous... If they have a breakfast menu they should serve it all day In order to satisfy all customers... I ordered lunch instead I got the Quinoa Crunch Bowl and my boyfriend went for there Signature \"Unfried Chicken\" and we both were very unimpressed. I was told by the cashier these were there two most popular menu items ? They were bland and tasted like no love was put into the dishes. THIS PLACE SUCKS .... Don't fall for the Hype it's a rip off with shitty food!"}
{"text":"Organic and just makes you feel so good about anything you eat or drink there. They have vegan and gluten-free menus as well as menu for the omnivorous - who eat everything. Their ice water is actually a reverse osmosis filtered tasty water that some strip restaurants charge for and serve bottled. And it is free here - self serving instead of the nasty Las Vegas tap... There's plenty of choices for food and drink items, including freshly made ginger teas, smoothies, veggie burgers from scratch, wheat pastas, lots of kale options, there's meat menu items too...Tried only the veggie burger, sweet potato fries (amazing btw) and kids pasta with marinara last time but will be back to try other items as well... Great location by the whole foods too! This should be called the whole restaurant :))"}
{"text":"After my previous review I was quickly contacted by Lyfe Kitchen.  Within the next few days I was directly contacted by the manager of this store.  That alone shows that there are many individuals within this company that truly cares about customer service and what Lyfe Kitchen represents.  Although this was my first time at a Lyfe Kitchen and the experience wasn't what I had expected, I have to remember that one rotten bad egg shouldn't spoil the rest.  The rest of the staff that day were very genuine and kind, and overall cared about service.  It was the day after Thanksgiving, where many of us get to spend it with our families, but they were working, which I can commend them for.  Although the manager wanted to bring me and a guest back for a complimentary meal, I would rather have that go towards someone that might need it more, especially during this time of year, which is a great time to give back.  Having him reach out to me really showed me respect and how much they value their patrons.  I will definitely be coming back here in the near future, thank you!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp so I decided to give it a shot. Came in on a Tuesday afternoon and the restaurant was very cute and spacious. It had a patio and the inside where you can sit. We started ordering and the cashier was very nice. Keep in mind this place is self seated but they do bring you the food with the number that they gave you. The food was delicious! Their lemonade drinks was very good and more on the healthier side. We left with a happy stomach. Most likely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I was going to post a negative review but then the manager made my negative experience very positive. I go to Lyfe all the time. Good good. Great if you are gluten dairy feee."}
{"text":"My friend and I brought our daughters here.  We all loved it.  The pizzadillawich is a must have its available in gluten free and vegetarian which was awesome for me.  The kids loved the vegetarian chicken strips and the cheese pizza.  So yummy."}
{"text":"I come here weekly mainly during lunches, and it is  one of my favorite stops. The menu has a variety of health conscious ensembles. Salads are amazing. Quality, clean, & staff is on point. My only suggestion is to increase Organic selections. (The sweet potato \"fries\" are not fried in oil, they are oven baked -tasty-healthy )"}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite place to eat in Henderson. I would highly recommend this place for a healthy meal that will fill you up, taste great, and actually not cost that much.  Check this place out, it's really cool inside (vertical herb garden, etc.) and they have rich people water on tap! for free!"}
{"text":"Glad we came ... good healthy food ... good portions.. had burgers, chicken sandwich  (gluten free) quesadillas, soup, coffee  ... delicious!!!! Prices are what they are for eating healthy"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it more stars at this moment because it looks like a really nice place to sit down and eat.  I ordered food to go and it took about 20 minutes or so to get my food. When I got my food it was not what I expected. The taste if the food was very good yet the portion size was more than lacking.  I ordered the margarita flatbread, salmon meal in the gluten free
Menu and lemonade (that came with
Mint which I didn't know).  The flatbread looks more like an appetizer at $8 plus.  The salmon was a long lean piece if salmon with lots if this sauce and onions but just a tiny portion of broccoli.  It left both my husband and I still hungry. The lemonade was refreshing yet he didn't like that it had tons a mint.  Also they forgot to offer us cutlery and napkins for our to go order.  I am sure they can do better as they just opened recently.  I'll try going another time and eat at the restaurant to review the dining in experience."}
{"text":"Well I am healthy and like healthy cool stuff! I had the Grilled artichokes and they where under cooked ! 10 bucks for a few good bites! I put the rest in the microwave for 2 minutes and it was a lot more tender! But 10 bucks ? My friend had the chicken black bean bowl and she said it was good: I also tried the Buffalo chicken strips not fried ! And with a pickle it was really good but very small plate for 6.99! At least put it on a salad : I will go back : Maybe?"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that is healthier than most, it is also tastier than most. Flavor is not sacrificed for the health benefits at Lyfe. I absolutely love this place. Tons of gluten-free and vegan options as well! And my favorite part has to be the beers on tap. They seem to constantly be rotating the taps with new beers, so it's always interesting. I highly recommend this place for any meal of the day. Very affordable too!"}
{"text":"Food an service were excellent. I've been looking for healthy alternatives when eating out. I had found some but the service was not great. LYFE kitchen is set up very well for traffic flow and every employee I encountered was polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Tighten up, Management. Nothing worse than a great idea, a clean facility, and decent to good food ruined by very poor and disappointing service...

Breakfast this morning with a large party. Around 20 minutes after ordering, my simple oatmeal had still not arrived, while others who had ordered egg dishes etc were already eating. This was because they had run out of oatmeal. How can you wait twenty minutes after running out to come tell us it will be another ten minutes before more is ready? That is not how a dialed breakfast spot runs. They should have told us in a reasonable time so we could switch our order if we didn't feel like waiting a half hour for a bowl of oatmeal.

Getting our drinks was a major challenge, too. Clueless wait staff totally unaware what we had ordered.

Please cut this nonsense out already and learn how to execute proper service people."}
{"text":"The stars are for the food.  The order process is long and orders take forever after being placed. I have been here several time day and night and it never changes. Service is bad as well last time I came I waited in line so long I left, the girl at the register has to take phone orders as well as guest orders. My visit prior to that they brought out my girls food, and then mine 30 minutes later after I asked about it. 

It seems to start at the top. Usually the managers are just standing around socializing with the staff, I have witnessed this on several occasions. 

The only thing bringing me back is the food."}
{"text":"Let me start with my conclusion:  mediocre value

Our food was good enough and it seemed like quality ingredients, but the portions were very small and the prep seemed a little amateurish.

I did enjoy my salmon dish and my wife did enjoy her chicken pasta...and we both agreed they were good...nothing to write home about, nothing to complain about.  But considering the prices and proximity to Cheesecake Factory...there really is no choice. Flavor on both dishes was a little bland.

The staff seemed like naturalists and hippies, generally speaking.  Not judging them on those counts, just saying :-). So YMMV on the vibe depending on what you're into.

We will probably go back in a month or so and see if things improved.

Oh yeah...the $9 tiny artichoke dish...that pissed me off because that was delicious and tiny...if it was $3 that would have been fair."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place or awhile. Atmosphere is a 4, food is a 3, service is a 3. Price is high for what you get. Lunch parking is difficult.  Great for people on special diets. If wanting to eat in the neighborhood, PF Changs is cheaper with better food."}
{"text":"Another consistent LYFE Kitchen location!  Friendly service, nice atmosphere and delicious food.  I enjoyed the unfried chicken with brussel sprouts, cranberries and sweet potatoes with an orange mint chia water...so perfectly delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of those exceptions where I write a review after one visit, because I was just that impressed! Finally, another healthy place open for dinner! Oh wait, and a healthy place I can take the kids to, DOUBLE WIN!! I am so happy Vegas, (well mostly Henderson) is finally catching on to this health craze! About time! 
LYFE stands for Love Your Food Every day. I could easily if I was lucky enough to eat here daily. 
They have fresh green juice, and multiple types of infused waters. Also lemonade and tea that were both literally the BEST I have ever had. The black tea I could get addicted to! 
Between my boyfriend and myself, we ordered grilled artichokes, corn chowder, fish tacos, and chicken and mushroom penne. 
NOTE: every menu item has the ingredients listed, as well as the calorie count. There IS NOT a dish over 600 calories. 
Other than it did not completely fill me up, I was 100% satisfied! Flavors, textures, price and portion was all spot on!!!! Not to mention the service was ideal! Great people, serving great food. I was exceptionally happy. Tons of options for picky eaters. Gluten free, and vegan, totally available! They want you to love your food, and show you that it's possible to do while still eating right. 
Well done LYFE Kitchen, I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Always a great healthy experience here. The food is healthy and very tasty. The have different menus for different eating styles. The best thing is their waters. Try it, you wont regret it!!"}
{"text":"The owner truly understands the concept of \"real food.\" It's great to see trends setters like LYFE Kitchen set the stage for others to follow suit."}
{"text":"Third and last time here. I ordered the goat cheese and mushroom flatbread and it was covered in onions which is NOT listed on the menu. I don't understand why restaurants don't list CRUCIAL ingredients like onions that many people offensive. When the guy delivered the flatbread, I asked if onions was listed on the menu and I missed it, he said yes it's on the menu. So I had to get up and go look at the menu and NO it's not listed. They made me a new one without onions, but based on my previous mediocre experience here, it's not worth coming here."}
{"text":"Second time here...once for breakfast (which was the bomb!). Having their seared tuna salad. I'm eating keto right now...this thing is perfect with a substitute of lemon vinaigrette dressing! In heaven. The tuna is delicious,  greens fresh, cashews crunchy. I'll be baaaack!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential but it flat lines quite a bit. Upon entering it's quite a lovely set up, clean, open and compliments well with the health conscious agenda they have going on. Upon ordering, the cashier was daft and literally stared off into space while we waited to order and repeatedly tried to get his attention (we had to say, \"sir?\" 3x before getting a response.) I ordered a flatbread pizza, my uncle a chicken sandwich and my aunt the unfried chicken, we also ordered the guacamole as an appetizer. At the time the food was good and we didn't have to wait long to get it, but later that evening I got sick and I later found out my uncle did too. I'm not sure if it's something they cook with that we may have had an allergy to or we might have caught a bug (I don't think we caught a bug, but I'm also not ruling it out.) In conclusion, I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"We're highly sensitive to gluten cross contamination, so this was an excellent find. Great ambience and vast selection of gluten-free options (non-GF is more the exception here). The curried noodles were a little heavy on the veggies and a bit dry for my liking (was hoping for a heavier sauce, where this was more like buttered noodles with some straight Indian curry mixed in), but still a great blend of flavors and texture. The flatbread margherita (added grilled chicken) was a delicious opener, with a very tasty red sauce comparable to that of some of the more family-run Italian restaurants we've visited in New York and Florence."}
{"text":"Delicious. Healthy. Quick. I have been here a few times, and today I had the wahoo fish tacos with chips and salsa. So good!  I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"The food was good; and I would have left 4 stars, but a snot nosed little girl food runner made a snide comment about me ordering goat cheese on my burger as a man. The little things make a difference..."}
{"text":"Prompt service! Great outdoor  seating with misters and heaters !
Food is great with all the accommodations of vegan, vegetarian and gluten free!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a hipster / yuppie hangout. I'm not really into that kind of food. But I gave it a shot. I didn't die from the kale and the weird iced tea. I would probably go back if I'm with people that really want to go there. But is never go alone."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. Great location and atmosphere, but last time there were issues with the service, and this time it's about the food. 
I ordered the Italian Flatbread Sandwich - it was listed on their special board as grilled vegetables and goat cheese between their flatbread. Sounded tasty and like many other vegetable sandwiches I have tried. Only problem it wasn't. The vegetables were mostly peppers and onions with a little bit of eggplant. It appeared to have been sautéed on a flat top and not grilled. A bit oily. There also was no goat cheese, but after my last experience I did not want to question it. The best though was their Chicken & Kale soup. Great spicy flavor, with chicken and root vegetables, but NO kale. They topped it with a few fresh spinach leaves. Not sure if that was supposed to fool me about not having any kale, because I have never had it served that way before. For a place that promotes itself on serving healthy options, your guests know what they are eating. So instead of saying it's Chicken & Kale soup, just say Chicken & Vegetable.. 
The food at the Lyfe Kitchen in Denver was fantastic. I hope this location can up their game and deliver the same great flavor."}
{"text":"I have to say one of the reasons I am giving this place 2 stars is because they do cater to people that have food allergies and intolerances. I recently had my first experience at LYFE Kitchen and to say I was unimpressed was an understatement. Our family met up and it was a safer place to eat being I have a sibling who has to watch her diet carefully for the sake of her infant son. The food was sub par at best- half our table ordered the grass fed beef burger. It came out like a hockey puck. After bringing it to their attention we got some song and dance about the health codes and it was cooked at the minimum required by law. If their patties werent so thin I could understand but all their burgers are cooked on a conveyor belt and they informed us they couldn't set the time for less. In other words, all burgers will come out overdone, dry and tasteless. It's a good thing they put onions and pickles all over it- that was all I tasted all night long. Their attitude was as poor as the burgers they served. Other family members had flatbreads which came out luke warm, & after being sent back they STILL came out cold. Do yourself a favor and find another healthy \"kitchen\" to eat. Rachels Kitchen is WAY better and they are friendly without attitudes. Thanks but one and done."}
{"text":"Food was horrible, very bland with no taste and way overpriced.  I got the burger and it was one of the worst ones I have ever had.  I really wish I took a picture to show how bad it looked.  Also beware as they don't server soda.   I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Eaten here several times since moving to Henderson and if you're vegetarian love their tofu tacos and Margherita flat bread with this basil aioli on the side. 

The staff is very friendly too and love their drinks like the Annie Palmer and cucumber water ."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend have started to eat healthy & decided to try this place out. We were very satisfied, I ordered the farmhouse burger with garlic sweet potato fries definitely recommend it. We also ordered the unfried buffalo strips nice & juicy i must say. My girlfriend got the buffalo chicken wrap  & for dessert we had the gluten free cookie. To drink we had the hibiscus. Everything was very good & seasoned right I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Life kitchen has pretty tasty healthy food.  I love that the menu lists ALL the ingredients and the calorie count.  There are options for everyone's dietary  restrictions or preferences.  There is no taste being sacrificed when it comes to healthy eating here.  The untried buffalo wings were so tasty and a perfect dinner started to share with friends.  A little bit of heat, and a great over all flavor and texture.  There teas are yummy and the quinoa hummus bowl was amazing."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying I LOVE this place, but today I was not satisfied with my order. The kale caesar salad with grilled mahi was very bland so I was disappointed. Something was missing... maybe not enough to the dressing."}
{"text":"When walking in the layout is very clean and inviting. They have different types of menu's that you can choose from. I chose the GF - Gluten Free menu. I ordered sweet corn chowder and Grilled Chicken.

The food is healthy and good. I was very surprised."}
{"text":"Beautiful place to eat...had to start off with that info.  Wonderfully styled and designed space. With this location being directly across the street from Green Valley Casino, I'm guessing they will get good traffic.  The first thing I noticed is that their menus are separated by your desire of cuisine (Everything, Gluten Free, or Vegan and Vegetarian).  I decided to see what was on the V&V menu.

Ordered the Crispy Gardein Chick'n with baked garlic sweet potato fries, and a cucumber mint Lyfe water.  I like how the system is setup, where you are given a locator...and they come and find you.  When I saw the disc, I was like okay here go...its gonna start lighting up and buzzing and vibrating all over the place...then I have to run up to get my food.  Complete opposite.  First came my water.  I must say that this was the best tasting infused water I've ever tried in life! So delicious and refreshing!  I would go there just to have a couple waters! 

Love the layout of the restaurant.  Since its an open kitchen concept, you can watch the cooks creating your dish.  Thats really cool, since it takes out all of the guesswork on whats really going on behind the normal double doors.

Now onto the entree.  The crispy chick'n sandwich is delicious.  Never had a vegan sandwich that actually tasted like a sandwich with regular meat in it..until now.  Oatmeal bun was a nice touch.  The salad was very fresh and tasty. Sweet potato fries didn't have too much garlic so it would overwhelm the flavor of the potato. The aioli that came with the fries was so good that if they bottle it? I'm buying it.

Lovely decor, cool seats, nice layout, with guilt free food?  I will be here often."}
{"text":"Looked like a cool place to have some healthy food. Reminded me of a VERY overpriced Panera Bread place for some reason. Food was small portioned and unremarkable. I ordered a hamburger lol that I stopped eating after a while. My wife liked here spicy soup but thought it was pretty small. And her Cesar salad with grilled chicken was small and forgettable. Wanted to like it more but don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Clean and modern, this Resteraunt doesn't only have great tasting food, but it has great taste in decor! 

The organic decor and fresh herb tri later center wall offer a fresh dining experience like non you have had before. The slate and granite counter tops are clean and so if the air which definitely makes you feel like your food is fresh picked from the farm! 

My arts un-fried chicken was cooked perfect! The cashew cream was rich and decadent and the brussle sprouts were spot on! I have never ordered anything here that wasn't perfectly presented and cooked! 

Since I eat clean and Paleo/zone it's important to have a dining experience where I know no added sugars, fats and flavors will be hidden from My knowledge and that my son can eat organic as well! I love this place! 

Although a little pricey it's worth it! Especially if you work out, love to live or do crossfit! I highly suggest this Resteraunt!"}
{"text":"Went here with my dad and sister and honestly, this was the worst dining experience I have ever come across. For starters, I ordered a smoothie which was given to me with half of it down the outside of the glass (which after, realized it was given to me by the manager). After waiting for a straight 45 MINUTES, we finally got our food which was not worth the wait either. My sister got the black bean burger , which eventually fell apart after 3 min of eating it, and also got fries which we cold. In result, we notified the staff that the fries were cold and were told we were to get another batch (which never came). In the end, after complaining to 2 staff about our problems, we were not fully satisfied. Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"I was at this location during a visit with family, and my comment is based on the service. The staff were very accommodating for the finicky preschooler in our party - and I appreciate that. The menu is the same as the one in my city, so I ordered my favorite - the gluten free burger."}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience! Their food is delicious. I have tried almost everything on the menu. My favorite is the Farmhouse Burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had! They have a wide variety of healthy and sustainable foods. This isn't just a restaurant for health nuts. The diverse menu caters to people of all different palates. The Lyfe Waters are amazing. Orange Ginger Chia would be my recommendation for those who want to give them a try. After every meal I am satisfied-they fill me up yet I'm not overly full. The staff is friend, pleasant and willing to go out of their way to make your experience memorable."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly.  The food is always delicious and healthy.  The restaurant is always clean :) I feel great whenever I leave with a belly full of tasty food that is good for me"}
{"text":"Lyfe Kitchen has an awesome gluten free and vegan menu and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, worth a shot if you're nearby. Wouldn't go out of my way, however. Service is nice. The location is clean."}
{"text":"I hope the blender works so I can get to my class ;) I thing the smoothies should be bigger. $5 for a 10 oz smoothie isn't enough to fill you up.I hope the blender works so I can get to my class ;) Now if the glass they are about to fill was twice as big. They threw away the additional four ounces in the blender :(. It may be organic, but what about the excess waste on our environment. #WhatsTheEnvironmentalFootprintOfThisPlace"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  They are very accommodating when it comes to dietary restrictions and food allergies.  The food is healthy and delicious.  The tofu veggie wrap and quinoa pancakes are amazing.  Fiancé loves their chicken avocado sandwich on their oatmeal bread.  They also have endless sparkling water on tap!  Score!

The downfall would be time-service and cleanliness.  It takes 10 minutes before the coffee comes out to the table; luke-warm coffee, might I add.  If you are on a 30 minute - hour lunch break, don't even bother.  If you plan on ordering take-out, the hostess will notify you it'll take 25 minutes.  Dining at the restaurant takes on average 25 minutes for the food...  Which is probably a good thing since everything made fresh-to-order, but it's not a good place for a quick lunch break...

Sometimes the tables look clean, but when you touch it, there's crumbs and and like a lint/dirt residue (if you sit outside).  The orange seats outside are starting to look brown...

Either way, I will still continue to eat here.  Can't eat healthy without having a little dirt to go with it."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I had the power green salad, cucumber mint water, and the vegan cookies. It was exquisite. Unfortunately, the cashier wasn't friendly and actually came off racist. She was older, working today and yesterday. There was a possibility I got the wrong intake until I was proven right again today. Yesterday was takeout making me wait 25 min for a salad, called the wrong name, didn't check up on me and didn't even apologize after I asked if my order was ready (it was sitting right in front).  To top it off they forgot to add the chicken to my salad. Both days I noticed I was not treated the same as the people in front of me as well as behind me. I can't believe places like this still exist. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Okay...okay,I am going to have to say this place is pretty legit...meaning it is a go to for Vegans,like McDonalds is to carnivores. You can never going wrong coming to this establishment,and if your  looking for a Vegan option,you pretty much know what the menu has to offer. It has a great ambience...very comfortable and great for meetings with coworkers, I would have to say this place could be considered a vegan Starbucks in a way...lol...I hope you guys are feeling my analogies on this review. The veggie burger and the quinoa salad is a very decent choice,it is deafly worth checking out and possibly making this place a go 2 spot...WOULD I EVER GO BACK??? \"ABSOLUTELY\" I will probably go Tomorrow."}
{"text":"Visiting Henderson Nevada we had lunch at LYFE Kitchen! Wow I was not expecting such fresh, delicious, fast service and reasonable prices! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't get your order to go with fries. The fries always end up soggy. I've been here a couple of times... Probably will stop going. I think the tacos are yummy but I got something else 2 different times and did not enjoy the meal. I brought my best friend here and she hated her food. Never wants to go back... The service is always sort of shitty... My friend thinks the cashier who was working the day we went back in June was a bitch. 

Giving it 2 stars since I liked my meal 1 time."}
{"text":"What a great place! The food is delicious and super healthy. I love that they have different options for whatever your diet is. They have 3 menus: everything, vegan and gluten free. They also serve wine/beer. Their coffee is really good and I LOVE that they have raw sugar and stevia -- not a Splenda or Equal in sight!! I had the spinach and avocado frittata and instead of the chipotle potato hash, I got a side of turkey sausage which was really yummy (I did have a bite of the potato hash though and it was really good). I also highly recommend the pumpkin pie latte while it's still in season!"}
{"text":"This place has a great menu that's broken down according to dietary restrictions and lifestyle choices.  I like that a lot, as it made it easy for someone like me with gluten sensitivity to order with confidence.  I had seabass in a kimchi broth and a side of marinated kale.  It was delicious and filling, not to mention low-cal, low-carb, and high protein.  Definitely recommend checking out LYFE kitchen!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed by anything here upon entering you are presented a menu which you read while standing in line. This is not a good idea for elderly folk. I prefer to sit when I read the menu. The staff seemed as though they all just left a pep meeting way too much  smiling it all seemed fake I ordered the fish tacos I received 2 appetizer sized tacos with perfectly cut rectangle pieces of fish, which were also quite bland tasting. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich it came on a oatmeal bun which was dry as.. Well you know, she said it crumbled apart in her mouth. Leaving most of it on the plate, not a good sign considering we were there on the second day they were open. The district manager explained my fish was dry possibly because \"the flavor may have come off before cooking as the fish was pre-seasoned."}
{"text":"Lots of variety; extensive gluten free menu. Lots of healthy options to choose from and I love that you can go through their dietary catalog and see each menu item and a break down of their nutrition.  Only downside was that I got an entree and a side and was still a little hungry after."}
{"text":"This place needs more LYFE. LYFE = Seasoning + Service. 

LYFE Kitchen looks like a healthy style L.A. eatery. Bright colors, clean dining area, with an open kitchen concept. But there's a few things that this place really needs to step up... 

First, The Service: I came here with my girlfriend. We ordered food and drinks, got a number, and sat down. We sat for awhile waiting for our food and watched as our drinks were placed on the bar. After about a minute, I started wondering was anyone going to bring these over, or do I need to get them? This confusion is warranted as this is a very much a \"self serve\" type place. With no servers really walking the dining room floor I couldn't ask anyone to get my drinks and wasn't sure if they were even mine. I mean a beer and a cucumber water isn't exactly a random order. Our food arrived and I asked about our drinks, the server looked perplexed, went back to the bar, and realized where these two lonely beverages belonged. Food, then the drinks? \"Hello... Hellooooo... I need some condiments, anyone?\" Servers only seemed to appear when food was ready for the tables. I could have used some hot sauce, ova here! In the section below you'll see why. 

Second, The Food: The food was ok. Underseasoned and to be honest very boring. I know what you're thinking, healthy food isn't as mind blowing as carne asada fries or a glimmering cheese filled deep dish pizza, but tasty and exciting healthy food does exist! I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, with roasted tomatoes, avocado, romaine, red onions and aioli, on an oatmeal bun. After three bites, the sandwich falls apart and you're left with a sloppy mess of chicken and avocado on your fingers. I had to finish this meal with a fork. The chicken was cooked properly, and the veggies were fresh, but it lacked salt, pepper or anything to spice it up and the aioli was almost non-existent. Thank the beer gods for the shining gleam of happiness, a Ballast Point Calico brew. Love me some southern Cali suds. 

I usually go back to a place after I've had a so-so meal, just to verify my experience. I will be going back to LYFE kitchen, but probably not for a long while.  

Someone breath some LYFE into this place!"}
{"text":"A great atmosphere to have business meetings or just hang out with friends. 

Super healthy meals and drinks. I got the Kale Salad and absolutely loved it. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Healthy eats at its best. The space is clean, minimalistic, hip and mad cool. The decor is very nice. The food is moderately priced and quality is good. I've been here several times and it's usually my go to for healthy good food. I was really craving the Quinoa Bowl or wanted to try the Mushroom Penne Pasta but we were here early and breakfast food was the only option until 11am. I'm ok with that too as I'm a big fan of breakfast. 

Ordered the Spinach and Avocado Frittata for myself and kid's size pancake for my cute little brunch date. The Frittata was ridiculously fluffy and tasty. The salsa was a nice touch. I also asked for a side of hot sauce and their hot sauce is awesome. I asked a staff member what hot sauce they use and she said \"Firemen's Hot Sauce\". I'll have to find this for my hot sauce collection.

The kid's pancakes came with two large pancakes, a side of yogurt and maple syrup. The pancakes were nice and light. The bonus is it's healthy and my kid didn't know the difference. The portion was huge for a child and he only at half of one pancake, we took the rest home. It was definitely a fair price for the kid's meal at $4. I find it hard to pay $8-12 for a kid's meal that they won't even finish. So the pricing for kids is great here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for a delicious, healthy lunch. The quinoa crunch bowl with tofu is AMAZING! Great breakdown of vegan and gluten-free items, but also plenty of choices for the omnivores. Another plus is the water bar, where they have sparkling water on tap along with regular (non-bubbly) water. 

Their web site makes it easy and convenient to order for pickup, too."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went there for my first time yesterday. The salad I got was so fresh and tasted awesome. Their complimentary water station is probably the best idea ever...every restaurant should follow suit. Their pricing is really reasonable too for what you get. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"In need of a healthy, yummy meal? Lyfe Kitchen is my favorite! 
The sweet potato fries are something you definitely have to try, add a budino while you're at it!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see the various menus one of which caters to us non animal eaters! YAY!
I have enjoyed the garden burger with kale side salad both times I have been here. I like the open air feel of the place. It is very bright with the tall windows. It can get very loud when it is busy which shows that there are a bunch of happy eaters. 
The price is just right to pay for fresh ingredients. The employees bring your food to your table and check on you throughout your meal and clear your dishes so you can enjoy chatting with your friends without a table full of dirty dishes. There are purse/bag holders at each table so make sure to use those if necessary. Both times my order came out in a timely manner. Again, I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes for freshness. 
I did notice a few of the female employees whose hair was worn very loose. I would like to see: hats, hairnets, something to keep their long hair, ponytails, and bangs as far away from the food as possible."}
{"text":"Weather your #paleo, #glutenfree , #vegan or just want great #healthy you can't go wrong with Lyfe delicious and healthy food."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this spot out since BEFORE it was even ready to open and I was NOT disappointed. I am Vegan so when restaurants that are earth conscious develop I'm all over it. I came in around 10:15am browsing the vegan options and ordered the Quinoa Crunch Wrap, and was told they only serve breakfast until 11am. As I looked at the breakfast menu I saw they only have ONE vegan entree and about 5-6 other non vegan options. And that was kinda disappointing . I was excited to try the sweet potato fries as well as the guac and chips but couldn't. I think to be more caring to others diets there should be an equal selection for vegans especially if you only serve certain foods during certain hours. So I settled with the Morning Veggie Wrap and it was so damn good! Even the salsa. It was so good I got a little bummed at the small size of it lol. The staff seemed pretty nice. Mostly young women, and one offered the Greek yogurt to me after I said \"you only have one vegan option for breakfast?\" Maybe the staff should get a clear picture on what vegan and vegetarian is, I find that many people don't know even when working in places that serve it because they just simply haven't been educated on it. Which is ok. But not when you're in front of customers.

 I noticed it was very clean as well. I love how they have plants and herbs growing in the middle of the restaurant and u can see them. It really sets the right vibe in there. Needless to say, I will definitely be coming back. I also grabbed the Banana Date smoothie. Very very delicious as well. Can't wait to try other options!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"We have been here like 5 times. Every single time it has been on point and delicious. Their vegan and vegetarian menu is the best we've ever had. Ever. Period. In any city we've been in. Including the Wynn. For vegans, try the everything. But mostly try the Chipotle hash Browns, breakfast burrito, banilla shake and tofu tacos. You will be happy. Like. Super happy. Like. 

I never knew what lyfe was until I found this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! We've been a few times and it never ever has disappointed. 

The menu... Seriously, 4 separate menus?! Yes! Gluten free, vegan, beer and wine, and an everything menu. Something for literally... Everybody. Being vegan and having an entire menu to order off of is rare in this town, So I get overly excited and want to order one of everything. 

The decor... I love the ambiance and bright colors and live plants. They have a cool little water station as well which is convenient, still, sparkling, and I believe room temp but I'm not totally sure. 

The food... Oh my gosh! We love the quinoa crunch bowl. Never ever has it not been totally amazing. Try it because it's so good. We have tried the sweet potato fries, Brussel sprouts and squash, marinated kale, chocolate budino, banana coconut budino, and the chocolate chip cookie. I can honestly say not one thing was bad. I could literally eat here every day and it would never get old. Well seasoned, nothing is too sweet or salty, and it is always consistent. Oh the coffee...organic and free refills! 

The service is always pleasant and knowledgable. Order at the counter and they give you a number for your table with a little buzzer looking thing. It's very easy and simple. 

The only complaint I have... They need another location. I live in Summerlin so this is quite a drive for me, especially because I want it all the time!! Oh and being open until 11 wouldn't be so bad either, since it's Vegas and lots of us work the night schedule:)"}
{"text":"Best gluten free brownie. Good gluten free buns for sandwiches. Loved the chicken & avocado sandwich. Sweet potato fries were soggy, only downside."}
{"text":"This place you will love if you like Native Foods Cafe, The Veggie Grill, and any kind of independent vegan or vegetarian restaurant. Lyfe kitchen is a franchise or chain but it's more like a franchise because of how clean and nice each and every location is. They are all very careful to accommodate every type of eater and to have something for everyone. I love it!

You might have to accommodate some preferences on your dishes but either way it shouldn't be much. Most of their dishes are filling, satisfying, AND healthy! A hard combination to come by but lyfe kitchen fits and accepts the challenge."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.   Food was great,  service was a bit slow... probably not a place to go if you are in a rush unless you order to pickup. Hoping they will open one in summerlin soon."}
{"text":"Great concept for a restaurant. My husband and I are vegan and being vegan you struggle with eating out with other people. Not a problem here. Three different menus; eat anything, gluten free, and vegan. They focus on fresh food too. The vegan chicken is great. Pizza is good too. The desserts are the only thing that falls short. Don't bother wasting your money."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place for fresh healthy food options. You can't go wrong with the fish tacos, kale salad or sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Ordered sprouts/squash and also edamame humus plate. Yes these are snacks but they were definitely tasty. Great place if you forgot your lunch at home and you don't want that fast food option. I've been to a couple of healthier spots in hendo but none that I like until I came here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I got the breakfast tacos and they were delicious! Tacos with so much flavor :). Love the cholula! To drink I got the lemonade....it was perfect not too sweet like other places. I really love the location and vibe of this spot. They even have outdoor seating. Ill definitely be visiting again to try some more of the menu."}
{"text":"Second time back here the first time my experience fell short of what I expected that being said it's been a while since I have dined here, this time though I felt welcomed and taken care of the food was great and the service was wonderful thank you Cameron for everything! I will definitely be back sooner this time around."}
{"text":"I've been to Lyfe kitchen twice for lunch and enjoyed the food.  I tried the fish tacos and some vegetarian buffalo bites which sounded weird but were extremely delicious.  On my second visit I brought my 7 and 9 year olds who loved the caesar and kale salad and baked chicken strips.  The healthy food options were a hit.  I had the pizzadilla which sooooo good.  I do have to say the portions were a bit small so if you're looking for a hearty meal, order two.  Prices were reasonable for the quality and style of food and the atmosphere was very modern.  The only negative I can share is that once the food was dropped off, the staff were MIA.  I guess that is part of the style but it would be nice to have the check on us once in a while."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great.  That's really all I can say about this place.  I was HANGRY after a long morning of apartment hunting and the last apartment I had looked at was right next to this establishment, so my best friend and I decided to quench my hunger and check out my soon to be new local eatery.  I love the bright and cheery atmosphere you are greeted with.  The place is decorated in bright colors and huge windows fill the place with LOTS of natural light. I loved that about this place.  

The menu is kind of overwhelming on your first visit.  There are just so many options and you want to read the details about them to make sure you're getting something you like.  I felt a little rush with a line forming behind me, so I decided to keep it simple and get a turkey burger and sweet potato fries and a lemonade.  The lemonade was definitely extremely refreshing on a scorching Vegas afternoon!  the sweet potato fries were...alright.  Potatoes any style are my favorite food and these quenched my hunger but didn't exactly satisfy my taste buds.  They were slightly soggy and I really need my fries to have a nice crisp.  The burger was also just alright.  It was your typical turkey burger.  Nothing too special about it.  I'm not completely striking this place off my radar.  Since I will be living right next to this restaurant, it will definitely be a nice pitstop on my way home from work on nights I don't feel like cooking and want a healthy alternative, but it probably won't be the kind of place that I'll be running to to get my last meal when the apocalypse happens.  (Yes, I said when, not if... because it will happen.)"}
{"text":"This was our favorite place to eat in Henderson until they just recently changed their menu. They no longer offer RICE... lol... it must be mixed with quinoa. So if you don't like quinoa you're out of luck!! Haha. And the only bread they have now is ciabatta which is very fattening. No more wraps :( I count my macros/calories religiously and cannot afford to eat ciabatta bread!! I wish they cared more about their fitness minded customers. Sadly we won't be back."}
{"text":"The veggie burger here is really great. My reason for the 3 stars....? I expect a place with these prices and their food philosophy to have staff that is knowledgeable  of their menu. It is very frustrating to ask basic questions like is this \"soy-free\"? And to have the front line employees be clueless. And it seems to be a chore to find out answers. I am very disappointed by this attitude. I've eaten here 3x so its habitual. I will compliment them on getting my delivery order right (pattiy, lettuce, onion no sauces or condiments) lol. I love the veggie burger, but am not sure if I am getting the correct answers about its contents. Each time, different responses. So, I'm a little suspect. The only reason I have ordered the same item over and over is that they are using the Hillary's vegan burgers in their restaurants so I KNOW what's in those...the bun is suspect.   including the gluten free bun and the sides very iffy on those FROZEN potatoes they are using (contains dextrose which gives us clean eaters a side-eye). But when I don't feel like cooking.... I'll get the veggie burger on lettuce leaf as a quick protein pick up. Maybe someone will see this post and get me some answers. I would love to try some of the other items that may indeed be clean...My advice is to ASK...and then verify by having them get the book with ingredients listed....if they feel like doing so."}
{"text":"Not only was the food great, but the service was awesome as well! The manager David knew that it was our first time there, so after our lunch he sent over some dessert which was equally as good as the meal was! He really made us feel welcome and I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"A well engineered 'slight-of-hand'... breakfast is pretty decent.. all the rest of the menu is 'filler.' Like a chicken-wrap where maybe there was a sliver of the bird, but your taste buds are sayin 'all-salad.' And a glass of 'Simi cabernet' that ain't nothin like any Simi-cab you've had before (color more like a light pinot). Add it all up 2 wines, 2 entrees and the tab comes to $42... ain't no-way worth it."}
{"text":"All the food I tried was disappointing and flavorless. I ordered the dish they are \"known for\" the unfried chicken and the chicken penne. Because the unfried chicken is placed on top of the cashew cream it was slightly soggy. The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked. The chicken penne was even more bland than the unfried chicken. The presentation was sloppy and unappetizing. I was surprised the sauce was advertised as a cream sauce because it was watery. The vegetables were all different sizes which makes me question the knife skills of the prep cook. The pasta was so over cooked that I had trouble picking it up with my fork.

Overall, the food here is poorly executed and under seasoned."}
{"text":"First off I am giving an extra star for clean, modern interior along with good service. Got the grass-fed burger and hibiscus iced tea. Burger came with a small kale side salad that was tasty. The meal was a perfect portion and I left feeling satisfied. The burger was juicy and overall a tasty lunch. The bun was a little hard as previously mentioned in other reviews. I think the reason for this is that it appears to be toasted with butter. I will definitely be back again to try some options. Wish they added an organic/non-gmo menu to their menu options and I would be there 3-4x a week!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good food. I ordered the chicken mushroom and spinach penne. The scary part was that I found a bone in one of the pieces of chicken! Be more careful next time!"}
{"text":"Quinoa Crunch Wrap...drop the mic...done!  So good and addictive.  Add some sweet potato fries (well done) and it's game over."}
{"text":"Really good food!  Wish we had known that we had to specify vegan.  We wanted to try vegan food and ordered later to find what we had was not vegan and we had to ask for it.  That aside it was excellent food and it's a good thing we're not vegan !"}
{"text":"great for vegans, vegetarians and omnitarians?
there are options and options
i recommend quinoa bowl with salmon!"}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times. Not sure why people rate it less than 4 stars. Either way they have vegan, vegetarian, and normal menus. Very flavorful. The quinoa pancakes are a great healthy choice to breakfast.  Corn chowder is very good. My wife gets the vegan burger and says it's the best tasting vegan burger she has had. I love fresh healthy ingredients and this place has exactly that."}
{"text":"Great concept ,great location but sadly poor food quality and options.3types of meats.Small portions.Poor Stuff.High prices for what you get.Vegas is the spot for healthy kitchens and unfortunately LYFE can't compete with any of the Protein places in town.No return for me"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and the new vegan vietnamese lettuce wraps were to die for.

The water situation was weird though... I carry a bottle with me so I was happy to find they have a self service tap but it is broken. The three choices are chilled water, room temp water and sparkling but all delivered room temp water. They need to fix that, and install an ice machine.

Also I ordered two things with garlic in the name which were conspicuously garlic free. At about $20 per person I think ice water and seasoning are reasonable expectations."}
{"text":"Great food. Please be aware dog hair could be floating around while the dog also sniffs your food at eye level.  Not attractive for those screaming kids that were deathly afraid of dogs. Uggg"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now and always order the same thing. The Kale Caesar Salad with chicken is amazing. All my girlfriends love it, and even my boyfriend liked it! He ordered the Buffalo Chicken  Wrap. This is a wonderful healthy option and a good addition to The District."}
{"text":"So the menu is limited but what they have is good.  I had the frittata with potatoes and it was really good!  The turkey sausage was too heavy on the sage I would not order it again.  I liked that they had sparkling water on tap so that was a big plus!  We also tried the Greek yogurt which was really good. The only downer was that my husband said the coffee was awful.  Overall I would be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times- both dine in and pick-up and I totally love it. Great options for healthier eating with LOTS of flavor. I'm a huge fan of the edamame hummus! Customer service has always been pretty stellar."}
{"text":"We love this place! They have so many gluten free options and everything is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Some of the best fish tacos I've had! Although the portions are very small for the price the food is good!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested we have lunch here.  It was fantastic.  I had the unfried buffalo wings and sweet potato fries.  Both were good.  I tried my friend's quinoa crunch bowl and her daughter's banana date smoothie.  Both were delicious.  I thought the prices were fair, and the atmosphere open and welcoming."}
{"text":"IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES, PLEASE PAY ATTENTION.

My husband is allergic to onion. We made it clear when we ordered. It's on the receipt (see picture).

When his plate came, it was full of onions. Full.

He brought it back to them. They remade the scramble but just slid the old egg back into the new plate - even though it had been slathered in onions.

This is dangerous and extremely sloppy. Very careful, fellow foodies."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent everytime i come here. I usually get the crispy chicken with brussels and butternut squash.. the first time the Chicken was raw, the next time it was perfect, the next time the butternut squash was undercooked, the next time the brussels were way overcooked. Take my word and fix the problem. 
PS: I am a Chef."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food.  I tried the baked chips and guacamole, black bean chicken bowl and farmers market salad.  All flavorful and combined well with baked sweet potato fries.  The cost was a little expensive but I expected that.  It was too bright and warm the evening I went. The outdoor seating area needs a shade canopy or trees to cut the glare."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from this restaurant, The staff was very courteous but the salad was not good. I ordered the Farmer's Market Salad for $12.95 with Grilled Chicken, 
The grilled chicken was so dry it was hard and the salad portion was more for a side salad, 
The salad components were fresh but it was very disappointing as a first timer here. 
Dont think I will try lunch here in the future when there are many more options steps away."}
{"text":"I've been trying to get the Boyfriend to try this place since it opened. He's not really a fan of ordering before you sit down, so the first time we ended up leaving before ordering. Tonight we wanted takeout, so we decided to finally try it. We ordered the Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese Flatbread, and two orders of the  fish tacos. I substituted the Simple Green salad for the Marinated kale side with my tacos. It came without the Lemmon dressing, so basically just some lettuce and three tomato halves. I wasn't expecting much for a side salad, but I was really excited to try the lemon vinaigrette. Fail. 

Fish tacos were ok. I could see ordering them again, but $9.99 seems a little high. Two small tacos but they
 tasted good. The Boyfriend's side of Marinated kale was actually pretty good although it didn't look like there was any kale in it (probably why I liked it) 

The Bf's Flatbread was OK also. The food tastes good & fresh but for $30 neither of us was really full... Also it just really bothers me when I order takeout and they forget something. Of course we were out of dressing at home. Dry salad = blah! 

Maybe I'll give this place another try, but I'm not in a huge rush."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! A coworker told me about and we drove all the way from Summerlin. Food was delicious, atmosphere was nice and service was great too! Will deff return"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Kids food was brought out after adults were pretty much done eating. No soda, but they have beer & wine. Nice clean place with pretty good food."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish tacos - was a decent amount of food and the thing that got me most was that they were healthy yet delicious. 

Had a couple of the sweet potato fries with the garlic and Parmesan. AMAZING!

Can't wait to try more stuff on their menu everything looks amazing and healthy!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The staff is wonderful and friendly.  They are also very helpful with the menu.  I met the manager, and he was amazing!  Me and my friend were very impressed with how personable we were treated.  The food here is always fresh, healthy and delicious!  I have zero complaints because I've never been disappointed any of the times I've visited!"}
{"text":"We came here with the beckoning of five stars in good ratings. However, we ran into quite a few problems. I ordered a market salad and my partner ordered a vegetarian bowl which came with tofu. She specifically asked for the tofu on the side to give to me since she is deathly allergic to soy. When our meals came, my salad was fresh but I had to go on a search mission just to find the three cubes of roasted butternut squash and the three roasted brussels sprouts thrown in my bowl of chopped up lettuce. My partner got her bowl and a little plate of tofu. Her bowl was so incredibly dressed that the veggies in the bowl were sopping wet with a one note chili sauce AND it had about four chunks of tofu in it. We thought maybe they just picked the tofu out after they cooked the plate. I had to return it to the kitchen. The cook behind the counter recommended she try the vegetarian lettuce wraps. But thank God when they came, The waiter knew that the mock meat filling was made from tofu again. We were not happy. My partner decided not to eat anything, and I gave her the rest of my sparse salad. I went up to the cashier and the manager came over. She was incredibly apologetic and nice. She promised she was going to train her cooks on soy products  and reimbursed me the entire meal. She also gave me a cucumber mint kale cooler drink which was very refreshing. The whole meal left me in a quandary of whether I would return or not. The drink was amazing but the food was not up to what I had hoped. I guess I would come back and give them another go especially because the manager saved the day. My partner on the other hand I'm not so sure she might have been left a little gun shy."}
{"text":"One of my faves on this side of town. Plenty of vegan choices, but good for any lifestyle. I love the vegan roasted veggie tacos. My kids, who are not vegan, love the margarita flat bread and sweet potato fries. So happy that they have beer too :)"}
{"text":"What an absolutely lovely little spot! Restaurants like these are just what Vegas needs. People need to know they can serve more than just overpriced steakhouses and celebrity chef eateries. This is a small franchise with a focus on quality ingredients and healthy entree arrangements. They are better known for their vegetarian options-- two of which we tried. The veggie burger may look plain but is packed with flavor from the aoili. The organic tofu tacos are phenomenal-- easily the best veggie tacos I have ever had. The meat options include grass fed steak, which I will simply have to try next time. Lovely chic decor, friendly accommodating staff and sparkling water on tap! Need I say more??"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very health oriented. Fresh fruits and organic veggies are in rare form. Creative dishes but limited breakfast menu. I much prefer lunch. It has outside patio dining and is located across from The District in Green Valley. Certainly would go back for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to Lyfe at least five times. None of those visits has resulted in a satisfactory meal. It's a beautiful space, conveniently located and the service is great. They have a killer water machine from which you can get ambient water, cold water and sparkling water. I give them 2 stars for the above.

I can't give them any stars for the food. Nothing I have tasted there has been remotely good. Even the sweet potato fries. I bake better ones at home in my toaster oven. The vegetable sides are offensive, the pastas are a joke and the appetizers are very underwhelming. Basically, you don't come here for a great, tasty meal. You come here to eat under 500 calories which you can probably do in lots of other places with a more palatable outcome. 

Also, it's horribly expensive. So I would avoid. No sixth visit for me. Fool me five times..."}
{"text":"Great place to get good, healthy food. We need more places like this in Las Vegas. The portions are just right and there is a lot of care and thought behind the food. I had the tofu wrap and the cucumber-mint water and they were all great. The atmosphere has a super clean and modern feel. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place!  I've been on a whole-foods plant-based diet for the past 14 months and sometimes it's challenging to find someplace to satisfy my needs in addition to the desires of others.  This place can satisfy anyone!  It's so good that I went there 4 times in 3 days, every time ordering something new to me.  I've now gone 7 times in the past few weeks.  Here are my favorite meals in order (all were very good or better): garden burger (I've had many over the years and this one tops the list as THE best), quinoa crunch wrap, tofu tacos, vegan thai red curry bowl, chile-ginger stir fry, and vegan crispy scallopini.  My sister and uncle also loved the garden burger - my uncle getting it all 4 times he's been there.  My sister and dad both loved their sweet corn chowder, ordering it multiple times too.  I only wish there was a Lyfe Kitchen closer to my home in NorCal..."}
{"text":"Wow this place is so freaking good! I heard it was but yesterday I went there for lunch and got the lettus wraps and the flavoring was awesome! Also the seats in the place were very comfortable which is rare for a lunch place. Highly suggest you try this place :)"}
{"text":"I actually would stop in here again.  I ordered the fish tacos and grabbed napkins, cutlery and water from the self serve center console.  In a bit a woman approached the table and asked if I needed a fork (I already had one)  what is odd about this is this is not a table service place and she was not asking anyone else.  No name badge or uniform.. Later she was behind the counter staring (glaring) directly at me not breaking her gaze.  I don't even know if she worked in here.  It just felt very strange.  I will update next visit or write a new review."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we came here for a late lunch. Once we walked in we were not greeted or even acknowledged by the man or woman standing at the front. We sat off to the side and went over the menu to decide what we wanted to order. When we were ready we stood at the cash register and again we were not acknowledged by Gaven. Instead he stood there, looked at us standing at the cash register (ready to order), but continued to do whatever he was doing and not take our order. So we just stood there for a minute, and didn't even ask if we were ready to order, but once he realized we were all he said was \"I can take you over there\" (pointing at the other register). So we ordered and then took our number and sat down. Probably about 10 minutes after sitting and waiting for our food, Gaven decided to finally bring out our drinks by slamming them on the table and walking away. 

Cool, way to make an even better impression. Waited 10 minutes more and looked at our receipt because I wanted to know his name to write this review (LOL). Then we realized he actually rang in an order wrong so we had to go back to the front and get that fixed. We ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and he rang in a seasonal salad with Parmesan chicken. Likeeee what? When did the word \"Salad\" even come out of my mouth????? (Confused face emoji here)

Got our food and everything was BLEH. Got the farm burger, dry as hell. The Thai wraps were alright, and the Parmesan crusted chicken was nothing memorable. 

I will not be coming back, nooooo thank you!"}
{"text":"A convenient restaurant with gluten-free, vegan and vegetarian, as well as everything selections.  My hubby typically likes the healthy items while I..well, whatever I feel like eating.  The burger is actually pretty good here.  Half of the burger is enough for me.  I liked the side salad that comes with my burger.

I've also tried the roasted mushroom and goat cheese flatbread.  I was probably expecting more out of this than served, but it was ok.  My hubby usually gets the chicken and avocado sandwich and as simple as it sounds, it was packed with flavors.

I also enjoyed the hibiscus beet here.  The combination worked so well.  The fresh lemonade is also refreshing.

Overall, we like LYFE Kitchen, but the to-go service is sketchy.  My hubby ordered food to go and his food was sitting at the counter for half an hour before they realized it was his order."}
{"text":"3 fish tacos & kale and berry salad ? Pale ale beer.. Im good . so nice outside on the patio.. Everything was great..."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite fast casual restaurants and the food is fantastic.  While the portions are not enormous they are filling and exceedingly tasty and HEALTHY!  Of special note is the free, on tap, sparkling water that is free to every guest.  Finest ingredients and you cannot beat Art's Fried Chicken (which is not fried) and it's amazing sides.  I've had half the menu and never been disappointed.  It's right by Whole Foods and across the street from the Cheesecake Factory in the DISTRICT SHOPPING CENTER AREA.  Multiple thumbs up for indoor and outdoor seating year round!\"}
{"text":"This might be one of my favorite lunch spots in Vegas. It's fast, but not fast food. You order at the counter and they bring the food right out to your table. 

All of the food is fresh and great quality. My favorite is the grilled chicken avocado sandwich on a glutton free bun. I also like their sweet potato fries which are actually somewhat healthy for you because they are baked. Then the banana kale smoothie is really good and tastes very fresh. 

I wouldn't recommend for dinner unless you're just in a hurry or want something chill. This place is more of a lunch spot."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both times the food was good. The sweet potato fries are delish and the unfried buffalo chicken strips were very flavorful and didn't leave me feeling guilty afterwards. The classic breakfast is small so I would avoid that if you're really hungry, but the spinach and avocado frittata was very good! The chipotle potato hash is topped with onions, which I wish I would have known bc I hate onions. We saw another table order the quinoa pancakes and they looked amazing....might have to try those next time!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I was in town for 4 days and ate here 3 of the 4. Fish tacos - awesome!  Blueberry pancakes - very different and I loved them. I had them twice. My most favorite was the simple mint cucumber water. This place is simple with a great menu. Nothing greasy that makes you feel awful after you eat it!!  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"My first time. Clean and nice atmosphere. 
In my concept they can improve in service. No friendly staff, I mean I never felt welcome by anybody at the cashier or servers. They are not rude it's just they don't smile or say hello.  
The quality of the food is good. The way how the served the food is not the best. First came the soup. Then minutes later my husband's dish.  Ten minutes later my kale cranberry salad. Then minutes or maybe 15 minutes later my sweet fries. By the way they were Cold and  saggy. 
I called the server because in my kale salad there was not kale only lettuce. He explained that probably the person who made the salad did not pick up enough kale which it does not make sense because the menu stated kale and cranberry, not mix greens. 
In the station for water there is not ice. You have to go back to the cashier and ask for it 

Not sure coming back."}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been and again I had the roasted brussels sprouts and squash from the Vegan menu even though I eat everything.  It was SO good the last time I didn't even think of ordering anything else!  OMG. You have to try it!  Low in calories and fills you up, even though it is listed as an appetizer.  My friend had a salad with Quinoa and hummus with Chipotle sauce that was awesome.  LOVE this place!  Will try something else next time...maybe!  (I can't get those veggies out of my mind)..."}
{"text":"The minute I Walked thru the dOOR I knew this was the place for me! Vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian AND...Meat LOVERS friendly. The menu is extensive and   includes just  about everyone. I am Partial to restaurants with open  Kitchens. They will be automatically more conscious of food preparation sanitation. Next time I will post food pictures. I ordered the corn chowder (dairy free) and Kale cranberry salad. Sooo good. I like chowder but the cream doesn't work for me. They are located randomly around the country, so check cities. Prices are very moderate. Lunch was under $10. Also, the dining area is inviting, comfy, and they have a patio with umbrellas and mister."}
{"text":"The Art's unfried chicken was a big disappointment from my other visits there.  It was not crispy or as tasty as I remember it to be!"}
{"text":"I came here because I read the great reviews on it and happened it be in the area....

When I walked in the place had a very good vibe. We were greeted by a nice woman working behind the counter. It's the type of place where you order and then you seat yourself. I ordered the \"veggie salad\". It was nicely tossed. It had tomatoes and Mozzarella Cheese with a light vinaigrette dressing. I also ordered the \"chicken mushroom, spinach penne\" . It was pretty good. The penne was a little bland but it is on the healthier side so I couldn't complain.  I was really excited to try the artichokes and found out they are not on the menu anymore :-(
When asked, the employees said \"cooking of the artichokes were too inconsistent. Sometimes they would come out too charred and sometimes not charred enough so we had to remove them from the menu\".  I ended up adding the Brussel sprouts and squash as a side. It comes with a sweet mustard sauce on top that is very unique and mouthwatering. 
Lyfe Kitchen is nice and clean. It is decorated very modern and trendy! When you walk in there is a partition of fresh herbs! I was amused by it. I really like the service of the employees and how helpful they were. I would recommend this place to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical going here since \"healthy\" food & restaurants typically aren't my first preference.. Lol

But, the food was really tasty & I didn't feel overstuffed after finishing my meal. The portion size was good & sufficient. Prices were also reasonable. The setting is also very chill & earthy. 

I'd come back here if I'm in the area again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"It is definitely a healthy healthy place to be. If that's what you want I'm sure you'll like it. Though, for me it had small portion size and was a little too natural, I want a little more flavor with my meal. I had the fish tacos and they weren't bad, boyfriend hated the buffalo wrap"}
{"text":"I attended the Complimentary Tasting Event and was very pleased with my meal. Since then I have came twice and both visits have been great. I have had the Salmon, the sweet chile chicken tacos and the California burger and very happy with my selections, all delicious meals. Their beverage selections are great and natural, not the usual sugary sodas. Looking forward to going for breakfast this week!"}
{"text":"Life Kitchen sits in the compact but very busy Whole Foods shopping center on the east side of Green Valley Pkwy from The District.  Sometimes parking can be a bit of a challenge.

I really should expand my horizons and try other things on the menu, but both times I found myself getting the Buffalo Chicken Wrap w/ a side of the garlic parmesan sweet potato \"fries\" (baked not fried).  The fries are wonderful with loads of garlic and flavor the way I like.  The wrap is also great.  This place tends a little higher on the price, but only a little and I do think the quality of the food is worth it.  You can keep your bill slightly lower by passing on a drink and sticking with one of the fresh water options that they serve on a really cool tap.  Otherwise, they do have some really good and fresh drink options (they call \"Lyfe Waters\"), and they have a beer and wine selection (which I haven't yet sampled as I'm usually dropping on my lunch break).

The ambience of the place is bright and warm.  A very cool atmosphere.  And the service has been really good both times I've visited.  As a couple other reviewers have noted, they give you one of those table buzzers for your food which you end up not using as they bring everything to the table for you.

Since this is a lunch place for me, it's priced a little high for me to drop in too often, but I'm looking forward to the next time I get to go.  I definitely recommend for anyone looking to eat cleaner or just looking for something interesting."}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of \"good for you food\" but Lyfe changed my mind. The roasted Brussels sprouts and squash is amazing!"}
{"text":"Holy Crap this is pretty good healthy food!

I've eaten here like seven times now. I can say unequivocally that adjusted for \"healthiness\" this food is outstanding. It is 100% true you're going to get smaller portions than at a normal restaurant, and that this food will be less greasy, less savory, and different from what you expect. But it's still good!

The burger get s a bit of a wheat-grain flavor from it's bun but it's still good. They include a side salad with a lot of dishes that tastes either limey or salty depending on the day, it's hit or miss if you'll like it. The breakfast burrito is smallish but great, also relatively inexpensive (~6.00) the pancakes are similarly \"grain-flavored\" but are still excellent relative to their calories. The beer selection is masterfully chosen and has no business being that great.

Really, every restaurant should serve food like this."}
{"text":"I was excited to step foot into Lyfe and found myself here twice in one week to try out their offerings. The space is clean, modern and open. There is a decent amount of seating including an outdoor area. Several menus are offered: Wine & Beer, Vegan & Vegetarian, Gluten Free, and an Everything option. You place your order at the counter, pay, and served the food at your table. 

Orders:
Cucumber Mint Lyfe Water - Refreshing w/small hints of mint and a heavy flavor of cucumber since it's made w/cucumber juice. Also has agave and lime which I didn't really taste. 

Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese Flatbread - Consists of roasted criminis, caramelized onions, goat cheese, balsalmic, and chives. Approx. 8 small pieces which is good for an appetizer for 2 or a perfect meal for 1. Crispy crust was bonus! Available as a gluten free dish.

Pizzanini - Decked out in grilled yellow/red bell peppers, onions, yay for goat cheese! mozzarella, and basil stuffed inside what looked like a thinner version of a pita (which had a nice exterior crunch and was soft inside). Comes w/pomodoro sauce. I love anything pizza... proof in the flatbread option above. There is a lovely hint of sweetness in this dish from the vegetables and the goat cheese just smooths everything all out. A+ from me. You can also add chicken to this and get it gluten free.

Lastly, the Spicy Chicken and Quinoa Soup (w/cilantro & lime). This was an absolute all star dish! It reminded me so much of a Vietnamese dish called \"canh chua\" or \"sour soup.\" It has the best blend of sweet and sour flavors and also had a nice kick to it. So be prepared for some fire. There are a few veggies in this dish, but unfortunately the one that I remember is the potato.  With my lacking memory, I can say with good faith that this was a stellar soup! 

Notes:
Does anybody else notice that there is a high content of sodium in most of their selections? I questioned the cashier about this and the response was that most food has natural sodium and additionally they cook with a specific blend of spices that does contain salt. I'm not an expert in this area, but would love to be enlightened here. That wasn't a sufficient answer.

Customer Service was strange here. I had a few questions, nothing extreme. I inquired about the sodium and asked for recommendations. The cashier cut me off in the middle of speaking and asked the customer behind me if she was ready to order. I wasn't asked if I would mind waiting or given the chance to respond to the current situation. It was a poor choice in my opinion. I also noticed that the other employees appeared stern and unfriendly. A bit unusual? I'd say so.

So in closing, it's nice to see the efforts/initiatives here and know that depending on the day, I can select the food that is most appropriate for my mood from one simple location. It's a lovely place to meet up with friends and get away from the kitchen. I'll be back in hopes that some of my concerns will be sorted out. Wish me luck!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I was a bit skeptical because I am not a vegan or vegetarian or restricted to any strange diet. I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night, and they were a bit busy but I was surprised the wait went by fast, and the food also arrived very quickly! 
I had the chicken spinach mushroom penne which was amazing! We also ordered the baked sweet potato fries and my boyfriend had the grass fed burger which he loved. Half way through or meal the manager was walking around making sure everyone was enjoying their meals..
Overall a great place. Great service and great food! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Quinoa crunch bowl!!! I could eat that every day. 
Just wish they had more dessert options! Bring back the budinos!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my go to spots when I first moved to the area back in January, but I've found myself going less and less in the last few months.

The space itself is beautiful, everything is modern and clean and offers good ambience for your dining experience. There's an outdoor patio with misters that work in overtime if you feel like braving the Vegas heat. 

My issue isn't really with any of that or the staff, but more so the food. I'm vegan and find that I can rack up quite a bill attempting to get a satisfying meal at this spot. It also feels like every time I go their portions get smaller. Their infused waters are still bomb though.

Dunno if I'll really be back much, but hey thanks for being there for me when I didn't know of any good vegan spots."}
{"text":"Yum!  Healthy stuff made fresh when you order it?!  My kind'a place! 

Stopped in for lunch on a Friday evening after a busy day of looking at properties.  I was starving and ready to do some damage. 

So when you get here you walk up to the counter - review the large menu (or the handheld detailed menu) and place your order.  You then take the number to your table where the staff will deliver it to you when it's done about 5-10 minutes later.  

The gal behind the counter who greeted us was so friendly and sweet.  She answered my questions with ease and good grace and helped make suggestions based what I wanted. 

In the end, we ordered a ton of stuff.  Fresh lemonade, ginger chia water, a bowl of corn chowder, a buffalo chicken wrap (avocado, black beans, corn, chayote, Romaine, and Greek yogurt ranch), a side of roasted brussels and squash and the unfried buffalo chicken strips (YUM). 

All of it was good - especially the chicken wrap and the unfried buffalo strips which were a pleasant and really delicious surprise.  

Idid not enjoy the chai water I chose but the fresh lemonade was delicious.  A much better choice - hey - you can't win them all!  For me it was just the texture of the chai seeds in the drink that I hated I think.... 

Either way - this place had good food, great service, and an excellent healthy menu in a great location by Whole Foods at The District shops.  Win!"}
{"text":"Healthy food is great, but to me it is hard to make \"health\" food delicious sometimes. Lyfe Kitchen does a good job of making it taste great!

Came here the other day for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant was awesome! I ordered the roasted mushroom and goat cheese flatbread and thought it was great. Also, I recommend the ginger mint chia water (or something like that...lol). It too was good.

The prices were definitely reasonable too, which is something that is also hard to find at \"health food joints\".

Looking for somewhere to catch a healthy meal for a decent price? Definitely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"We were looking for a vegetarian food place after the US National Usana Celebration.

Decor: Place looks very clean. I like the water dispenser, ambiant, chilled or sparkling. We were eating outside where the was beautiful palm trees on a Nevada sunset. 

Food: I just had a farmhouse burger with sweet potatoe fries. I don't know how I was able to record when I was nine years old burger when burger were more tastier. That was the kind of feeling I was able to remember. The sweet potoate fries wasn't nothing to remember but the burger was awesome!

Service: was on point and delivered fairly quickly. 

Price: It wasn't bang for buck but it is delicious for a 12 dollar burger. A little over priced for my taste. 

Notes:
Ample parking space
Lots of tables
They have TVS for watching the game. The NBA playoffs were tuned in at the time. 


Verdict: I would come back here once in a blue moon. Come on by to try it out!"}
{"text":"I love all of the vegan options, the flavorful water and the entire restaurant is beautiful. It's light, airy, the quotes on the wall are such a neat addition. We got the artichoke appetizer and I got a tofu salad bowl.   Also ordered some buffalo chicken salad, pumpkin chia pudding and the curry bowl. Everyone enjoyed their food but it was a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Cool. Modern. Urban. I really enjoy this place. The food is healthy, super fresh, and very tasty. Classy atmosphere with a casual, home-like feel. Fast and efficient yet it doesn't feel like a fast-food place. The spaghetti sauce is too spicy for kids but overall a family favorite."}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken Strips and Sweet potato fries are the business !!!
Highly recommend! 
So happy Lyfe Kitchen is in Vegas now."}
{"text":"LYFE Kitchen markets itself as having great gluten-free options. I don't have Celiac disease, but I do have some kind of intolerance. I ate there a little over a year ago and ordered a gluten-free flat bread. Unfortunately, I got very sick from it -- the way I get sick when I accidentally eat something I didn't realize had flour in it. The experience led me to believe they don't take their customers' gluten-free requests seriously. I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"OMG...this place is so good. The turkey burger is awesome, I mean really, beyond words good. The margerita flat bread with shrimp is out of the world good...and want to eat it all day long. Even the tea is good! The food is packed with flavor and it is so good for you. One of my family's new favorite places. Totally recommended."}
{"text":"As a newly diagnosed celiac sufferer, I was excited to try breakfast here.  The most over cooked eggs I have ever experienced.  It was absolutely inedible. Even though I ordered from the gluten free menu and stated that I was celiac, I still was exposed and have been suffering from a gluten exposure."}
{"text":"I got the farmhouse burger and the chipotle hash. First off, the wait took 20 minutes on a Friday at 1pm. Then I was served a REALLY dry beef patty. It was obviously previously frozen, but man the dryness was unbearable. It was like biting into sand, not pleasant. Now for the hash, it tasted good but I was expecting something other than plain potatoes topped with a chipotle sauce for 2.50$. I have to say I'm pretty disappointed in this place and I am far from picky."}
{"text":"This place is great because its very healthy and has a variety of non-gmo and gluten free food. The juices are really good and very tasty.  Everything I have had so far has been very good and full of flavor. The carrot muffins are also my favorite. I used to go to Rachael's Cafe across the street but this place is way better. Rachel's Cafe lacks the flavor and the service is bad."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian,  the fact that they have an entire vegetarian (as well as gluten-free) menu,  i, hands-down, had to try it.  I ordered the tofu \"fish\" tacos that were absolutely AMAZING!  Bursting with flavor,  and not like anything i had ever tasted before. Everything was fresh and crisp,  and plate presentation was very nice. It was very clean,  with attention to detail. I'm sad that it is so far out of the way from where i live :( i well definitely return, regardless of distance."}
{"text":"The portion you get at Lyfe are very small for what they're priced at. The plating and decor are very nice, but the food is nothing to write home about. Every time I've gone, the servers have been very nice, and quite helpful. You're paying more for the location and relaxed modern atmosphere, not for the food."}
{"text":"Great food! The food is healthy and so flavorful! Also, the atmosphere is clean and fun!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are outstanding! Delicious, organic food. Easy to get gluten-free. This is my favorite post-Camp Rhino lunch spot."}
{"text":"Vegetarian and Vegan options make LYFE worth trying if you fall in that category but there are hang ups if you are a carnivore

I believe that if you fall into that non meat eater category, this is a place that you would definitely enjoy.  It does have a large menu that caters to the gluten fee nuts, the vegans/vegetarians as well as a menu for the rest of us.  However, the items I had on the \"rest of us\" menu didn't leave me tasting for more.   I thought the seasonal special (Chicken and Black Bean Bowl) that I had was just...ok.  The chicken wasn't anything special and with a few pieces of avocados, jalapeños, and peppers didn't really turn this into something I would order again.  I'm ok with spicy which this was but give me some taste to go with all that spice!  We tried the guacamole and chips as well but again nothing blew me away.  Chips were on super crunch mode and very hard.  The Guacamole tasted the same and was on par with Chipotle.  My wife had the fish tacos that she let me try and just wasn't a fan.  It has a bit of that fish after taste which I do not like.   Good, fresh fish tacos shouldn't have that taste in my opinion.  Along with 1 drink (hibiscus iced tea which was very good) our two entrees and app, ran about 33 bucks which is a bit on the pricey end for me.   

Conclusion - probably wouldn't eat here again on my own but when my vegetarian boss comes to town and we're looking for a lunch time spot, I'll probably bring him by just for the vegetarian offerings alone."}
{"text":"Best thing is the super cool vibe inside. Décor is clean, nice big patio, and there's a huge 'living wall' herb garden right at the entrance.
Also cool: lots of healthy options, and even on the not-so-healthy ones, you can get the full nutritional facts, which I really appreciate. I had a thai-ish curry dish that was pretty good and my kids split some chicken strips which were decent. 
The beer/wine list is kinda cool, and I also liked the wide selection of iced teas.
Main complaint: price. Most of the entrees are in the teens, which is kinda high for lunch or fast casual or both.
I'll never bring my husband here, but for the healthy choices alone, I'll come back with my kids some time when we want to splurge."}
{"text":"Yes, eat here!

I love the separate menus.  This restaurant is perfect for the group of people that includes vegetarians, vegans, carnivores, someone who is gluten-sensitive, and the really picky eater who has to special order everything.

Food tastes great, looks beautiful and makes me feel great!  

The flavored waters are refreshing and so tasty.  Much better than soda!

We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Meh. This place was okay. The food was dry, the price was definitely not worth it. Portions were small, and the coffee was bland. There were a lot of people in line though, so I guess they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"What happened to freshly prepared, real ingredients? Now the food is frozen, processed, lacking in flavor, coked by mindless staff who don't  care anymore about the lack of quality from opening, the dumbing down of the concept or that service is non-existent.  No guests during what used to be lines put the door mean Lyfe will be closed soon.  Sad because at opening it was great."}
{"text":"-Awesome food and the friendly staff.
-Very wide options on the menu.
-Order to table is very soon.
-Lots of parking space.
-Nice seating outside."}
{"text":"I am IMPRESSED 

Such a beautiful place and concept. The food is very fresh, they have a little bit of everything.
I tried the black bean burger with arugula salad and the grilled fish tacos. They both were to die for. Unfortunately they have this location only. Wish they can open another one in SW area"}
{"text":"Walked in, very clean restaurant. Customer was A+, did a take out order. Didn't wait long at all! I had the quesadilla (pepper and mozzarella cheese) came with salsa, yogurt sour cream and some other sauce. Was delicious! And also had the garlic Parmesan sweet potato fries and a parm lemonade iced water :) definitely going back to try new things!"}
{"text":"Great food and location! They have excellent and VERY delicious vegan and vegetarian options. I would give 5 stars if it weren't so pricey. Lol My partner and I are now vegan and was very excited to see their menu and photos other Yelpers have posted. If you're looking for healthy and delicious options, check this place out! Totally worth it."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! It is like a breath of fresh air! 
I only wish we had something like this on my side of town!"}
{"text":"Super fresh food you can feel good about eating. Highly recommend the quinoa crunch wrap and the red curry!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I will not be able to rate the food as I was not able to taste it. I drove by this restaurant and unsure of the hours, checked the website as it was nearing 9:00pm. The website did not list the closing hours, just the opening date and time. As this is a new restaurant, I thought it would be worth checking out. I walked in the doors at 9:02pm and noticed that it was still quite busy with many tables seated. The gentlemen at the counter advised that the restaurant closed at 9:00pm. I mentioned that I checked the website and the also that the door did not list the closing hours, just the opening time. His response was to recite the opening and closing hours for the remainder of the week. I asked if I could just order a salad to go and I wouldn't require anything to be cooked. He proceeded to tell me that the kitchen had actually closed early and they couldn't make anything......further contradicting his statement of a 9:00pm closing time. He then asked if I would like to take a to go menu? I didn't want a to go menu, I just wanted a bed of lettuce and dressing, which apparently is as difficult to accommodate for a new business as a clearly stated closing time. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Lyfe is okay, nothing to rave about. 

Between Lyfe, Daily Kitchen, Greens & Proteins, Fix8 Fitness Cafe and Protein House I would rank Lyfe on the bottom out of the healthy cafes. There isn't anything that stands out on the menu. 

Its in a great location, thats about it."}
{"text":"Lemonade is sour, service is ok, portions are small, price is high and chicken sandwich is good"}
{"text":"While driving home yesterday, I spotted a new place.  This place seemed to just POP up!  Went home and grabbed the wife for some healthy grub.  When we arrived we were greeted by a nice guy who introduced us to the menu and told us that the place just opened that afternoon.  He recommended a few things off of the menu and we went up to order.

At the counter, I ordered the steak, tomatoes, and potatoes and my wife ordered the veggie burger.  There were a few hiccups at the counter, but that could be expected being a brand new restaurant.  No worries for us.  The waitress told us that there was an \"grand opening party\" going on and that we could sit anywhere we could find a seat.  

The steak, tomatoes, and potatoes and the veggie burger were great.  Saying all that, there was one issue, the restaurant was incredibly hot, and probably because the there were so many people there.  The food was delicious, so it made up for it.  Near the end of the meal, a waitress asked if we wanted dessert.  We had the chocolate cookie, which was warm and delicious.

{"text":"We've been wanting to try Lyfe Kitchen since opened a few months ago. Today we finally went and I must say I am pleasantly surprised. The modern, clean lines and green feeling is a nice setting. The service was very good, super friendly. 
I ordered a quinoa salad bowl, a big scoop of quinoa, cucumber slices, halved cherry tomatoes, radishes, slices of buttery avocado, a handful or arugula, and a side of a yummy tomato vinaigrette. My hubby got the spicy chipotle chicken bowl, a thick, spicy black bean soup topped with grilled chicken slices and veggies, he said it was delicious, but he could have ordered another as the serving size he felt was too small for him. However, I must put in a disclaimer that he is a big eater and his idea of portions is much larger than the regular person. My daughter got a hamburger with a wheat bun with a side salad and baked sweet potato fries. We each ordered the ginger-mint water which I loved. Fresh mint leaves and strawberries slices and chai seeds floating in a tasty, refreshing drink was delicious!  Overall, quite pleased with our dining experience today. Total bill was $39 and change."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here and it's different than i remember. They used to have a menu for vegetarian,    chicken and beef now it is just one smaller condensed one. 
I ordered the farmhouse burger and butternut squash soup.  I thought the soup good and a value but the burger was not. They have 3 different kinds of water and free, just self service.
 I was filled up for a couple of hours but for $17.50 i could have gotten more even at Whole Foods."}
{"text":"This place was alright,  I was a little disappointed because right when I walked in I thought \"wow, this place looks gorgeous. The food has to be good.\" The first thing that caught my eyes were the assorted herbs and plants near the entrance that complimented the already fresh,  clean,  and open look of it; however, I should know better to judge a restaurant on its looks.  Once we were seated,  we got our drinks first and I decided to try the orange juice,  ginger,  and Chia seed Lyfe water which was absolutely delicious.  I enjoyed the gelatinous texture the Chia seeds leave off when they're submerged in liquid,  and it didn't taste like your typical drink. A perfect refreshment for a hot summers day in Vegas if you ask me. I ordered the antipasto which was... Alright.  The woman who took our order mentioned that it was really good,  so I had high expectations. Sadly,  it was not all that great. I think I would have enjoyed it more if it were more of a traditional Italian salad with more olive oil perhaps or balsamic vinegar; it was basically missing some extra flavor.  We also ordered some sweet potato fries which were surprisingly tasty.  Although I've had better sweet potatoes fries,  and these were particularly soggy and not crunchy.  The sauce for the fries made up for it and was actually very good. Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to go  back to lyfe  kitchen since it's so far from me and the food didn't leave me with a huge smile of satisfaction.  However,  I would give this place another chance and try out their other dishes if I happen to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Why haven't I reviewed Lyfe Kitchen yet?! I've been a handful of times and tried various items on their menu. Everything is excellent! I love the atmosphere. And by the way, thank you for the sparkling water on tap."}
{"text":"Lyfe kitchen was amazing. Had plenty of gluten free/ vegan options and the taste is pretty phenomenal!! Wish they had one closer to home!!"}
{"text":"Fail. Both times. I love the idea behind the restaurant as I've recently tried to be more health conscious with my eating habits, but unfortunately Lyfe Kitchen has disappointed both times I've tried it. 

The first time, I ordered their chicken breast with brussels sprouts. Sadly the chicken was SO bland; it was horribly underwhelming. However the brussels sprouts saved the dish and were the only things on the plate that I ended up eating. 

I went into the second visit optimistic that I would have a better experience. This time, due to time constraints, we opted to take our order to go. The Spicy Vietnamese Lettuce Wraps sounded like a sure thing: beefless tips, crispy lettuce, and Thai basil...it sounded as if it would be \"The Redeemer\". To my utter disappointment, when I got home I learned that they packaged the \"crispy lettuce\" already served with the beefless mix atop of it, thus the wraps were soggy and depressing. I mean really, who packages lettuce wraps togo already assembled? I would highly suggest that they rethink this tactic. The actual beefless mix was much tastier than the chicken, but the integrity of the dish was ruined for me due to the soggy lettuce. It wasn't a wrap, it was a dud. 

It saddens me that I was disappointed yet again. The ambience is welcoming and the descriptions of the food sound appetizing, but unfortunately in my experiences they fell short of my expectations. I still would encourage you to try it for yourself, perhaps whatever you order will be more satisfying?! I probably won't be giving this place another try, but I suppose I should never say never."}
{"text":"Every dish is under 600 calories? Whaaaat?! That is insane. 
The food is healthy, but be mindful as the cashier told me, \"We cook with organic ingredients as much as possible.\" So, for those of you who are organic food purists (which I am not), it is something to keep in mind. 

Grass-fed burger- 3.5 star. It's good for grass-fed burger. It's not \"The\" best burger, but delicious for what I hear grass fed meat tends to be less flavorful (?) and dry. We can't win 'em all. 

Sweet potato fries - 2 star. It was soggy, limp, kinda like the super oily, dead fries that you sometimes find at Mc Donald's. These are supposed to be baked, and apparently, they were super crispy when my partner had tried them last. Not when I tried them... :( 

Fish tacos - 5 star. The cashier told me it's the most popular dish, and people come back for it. So, the fatty that I am, ordered this as a \"kids menu\" (one taco only) just to try it on the side. WOW. I've NEVER liked fish tacos. This was the highlight of my night. The crunchy veggies on top add a nice contrast and texture. And, since my side was sweet potato garlic fries which came with a garlic aioli, I dipped my tacos in the sauce, thinking it was originally for the tacos. Well, it turns out the original fish tacos do not come with this sauce. They could maybe add this to their menu, but oh wait, that would tip the caloric intake to probably over 600 calories with their regular menu that comes with 2 of these tacos. I dunno. It was delicious though. And, I wonder if it was the combo of the garlic aioli with the tacos that made it amazing. 

Refillable sparkling water for free? It's such a healthy alliterative to drinking sodas. Love that they have it. 

I will definitely be back for the fish tacos. Can I add garlic aioli on the side?"}
{"text":"Do you ever get that \"I'm going to regret eating this later- I need to eat in more- I need to stop ordering out\" feeling when you walk into a restaurant? LYFE Kitchen will NOT give you that. The restaurant (which is across from Whole Foods) is bright, uplifting and clean. The menu is simple, the portions relatively small and nothing will give you that heavy stomach feeling. 
Order the sweet potato fries with garlic!!!!!! It's less than $5 and you will not regret it. 
I didn't see many outlets, but LYFE Kitchen could be a nice place to study. 
Order food at the counter and they will bring it to you- Enjoy your meal! :)"}
{"text":"Everything is made fresh. 1st time I came my order was wrong and the young lady that took my order was not very welcoming but as I wanted a young lady was making the lemonade's with all fresh ingredients and was very nice explain the ingredients and its purposes to me so it really made me want to try other things . This 2nd go around different girl took my order very pleasant and knowledgeable on their menu. Loved the food!"}
{"text":"Really nice. We've had the quinoa salad and the artichoke dish, and they were both delicious. The banana and ate smoothie was great! Nice spot, great environment."}
{"text":"A restaurant that targets its customers seeking healthy eats does a good job providing signs depicting clean food; however, their food clearly does not reflect healthy eats.  Now based on one dish alone might not be fair to the restaurant but all of your foods should hold the same standard.

I got the morning tofu wrap and figured that this would probably be one of the healthier options on their breakfast menu.  The food runner comes up to my table saying \"here\" but i didn't move and waited until he placed it himself.  The food was extremely oily as illustrated on the photos I took of it.  Portions were tiny and about the size of my credit card per half.  Although I can't slam the place on the taste of the food (which was actually not bad) I felt like i could go to chipotle and spend the same amount but get more food that is equally as bad/oily. 

The decor is beautiful.  The main area to eat is very wide, spacious and open.  This restaurant offers complimentary water of three variants but I found the sparkling to be quite nice (comparable to perrier). 

Overall: Portion size, questionable healthiness of the food really test whether I will return."}
{"text":"This is the last vestige of the perfect restaurants. Order at the bar, but with service at the table; a hybrid. Food is consistently delicious. Service is quick and always with a smile. Healthy and unique dishes that won't break the bank. They have a free tap of regular, mineral or carbonated water. Rewards program. Even beer & wine. Live this place."}
{"text":"Amazing. Found this on Yelp and am so glad that we stopped here! After a few days in Vegas with unhealthy food, this place is heaven (to me). 

Loved the design, open concept, modern look. 

Got the chia mint ginger water - awesome. Will make that at home!
Other than that, we had the quinoa bowl (yummy and so good for you!) farmhouse burger (really, really good), the Italian flatbread (seems to be a calzone, really. That one was good, could use more spices) and as sides the brussel sprouts and squash (amazing), kale cranberry salad (very good), and the sweet potato fries (all right). 

Tried the vegan chocolate chip cookies since everyone was raving about them. They were amazing and tasted like regular chocolate chip cookies to me so that must be a good sign (I'm not vegan). 

Oh, and two more things that stood out:
- organic coffee for $2, free refills, and they have almond milk 
- they have a 'water bar' where there is sparking and regular water on tap AND you can choose between cold and room temperature water. Say what?!? Impressive. 

Pleas make a LYFE kitchen come to San Diego. Now!"}
{"text":"Healthy food is not easy to find.  Healthy, tasty food is even more difficult.  Healthy, tasty AND reasonable is almost impossible.  You get all three at LYFE Kitchen.  I don't recall the name of what I had but I have had it a few times.  It is a veggie roll up with a Seracchi sauce.  Excellent"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine. I really like the simplicity in their food but the flavors are great. Yes it feels healthy but you feel great and super satisfied after. I really like the quinoa crunch bowl.  Lots of freak crunch veggies and the salad dressing is so yummy.  I believe it's a chipotle dressing.  Their fish tacos are crunchy and so satisfying too. I've also had their curry. Not the biggest fan though.  I wished it came with some quinoa or rice so it's more filling. Overall you should give this place a try!"}
{"text":"A \"healthy\" cafe , that has great tasting food and reasonable prices.
The staff were friendly, fun and very helpful my 1st time in when I was trying to decide what to get.
They have a ton of options if you have dietary restrictions..  

If you like spicy... Try the Spicy Kale & Chicken Soup!  Very good.

The do sell wine and beer, with a few local craft beers in tap

It reminds me alot of The Laughing Planet Cafe in the Pacific Northwest.

A great lunch spot, near the District Area."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan nor do I care much about gluten free. As a regular foodie, I do like the whole ambient of the restaurant. There's patio seating. 

My tofu tacos were pretty delicious. Food tastes really fresh!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with family. Nice place, great food,wine on tap! What!!?? YES! Wine on tap! 
I had the hummus and the salad but with a large group many dishes were tried and no one was unhappy. 
Definitely try this place. Parking is easy."}
{"text":"Ok so, yes I actually went into a health food restaurant and not at gunpoint. That being said, I am not sure how to review this place, I guess the flatbread I had, was ok, but maybe a bit expensive for what it was. So if healthy is your thing perhaps give it a try. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Love the margherita pizza, especially during happy hour when it is discounted.  Just wish they didn't discontinue their kale & cranberry salad.  That was the best!  Other salads are very bland."}
{"text":"When I first heard about LYFE Kitchen, I was hoping it would be like True Food Kitchen (multiple locations throughout the country), a sit down place with a focus on healthy tasting food. Boy was I let down here.

This is an order at the counter place, so it's more casual and akin to Greens and Proteins. 

We got there around 7pm on a weekend. There were only two other tables besides us. 

The allergen signage on the menu is great. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of entrée options.

My partner and I split a GF flatbread, the salmon and red curry bowl.
I wanted soup, but they were out of both the corn  chowder and seasonal soup. Why were they out of soup on a prime weekend dinnertime??

The flatbread was OK, it could have used more sauce. The salmon was dry and under seasoned, and the curry was small for the price point. 
 
Our other two dining companions both said that these were things easily and better made at home. Agreed!

One of the few things I liked was the sparkling water on tap. That pretty much saved the meal and overall experience."}
{"text":"The vibe of this place, I love! The food was okay. It is nice that there is a healthy option like this in the area with the ambience of the restaurant itself. They have a lot of options, so I will go back and try something else. The cashier was super helpful and gave a ton of suggestions which was nice. They have a cool water station, and very nice indoor and outdoor seating options. Definitely worth a try! In the coveted Green Valley shopping center also."}
{"text":"I love a restaurant that can provide healthy food that is actually tasty and makes me want to enjoy it. The interior of the restaurant is very colorful, bright, and inviting. 

Another major bonus is that they post calories so that I can order within my diet quickly. No more playing with My Fitness Pal in the car for 10 minutes before I can go in and order. I also ate here with a friend that has many diet restrictions and she can enjoy the food here without worrying. The cashier was also very helpful when she was ordering.

I've been here a couple of times for lunch. On first visit I had the buffalo chicken wrap. Oddly, the only flavor missing was buffalo flavor so don't expect it to have that taste. Other than that the blend of flavors was good and the wrap was very filling. On my second visit I started with ginger pomegranate lemonade that definitely packed some ginger flavor so I really enjoyed it. I tried the Art's Unfried Chicken that was served with brussel sprouts, butternut squash, and cranberries. The chicken was okay, but not that flavorful and there wasn't much of the sauce on the dish. The vegetable blend was pretty good, but the butternut squash was pretty hard like it wasn't roasted long enough. I also tried the chocolate chip cookie which was good, but not that flavorful or great.

Overall, the food items I've had were pretty good, but not the best. I'll continue coming here because I think the food is good enough for health food. I'd also definitely recommend this place to someone with food allergies or restrictions since that is something they specialize in."}
{"text":"They meet a variety of health needs. Gluten free to vegan. I ordered the fish tacos which were recommended by a friend.  Generous portion of fish and a delicious creamy sauce that was served with a mixed green salad.  My friend ordered a chicken mushroom penne that a had a mushroom greens infused sauce. In addition, they had sparkling and flat water. The ambiance is that of a place you might see on Seattle or Northern California."}
{"text":"The service was bizarre. On a Friday night at 7 pm, the line was out the door, and there was only one person taking orders at the counter. We were in line for about 20 minutes, and we only ordered drinks. Took another 15 minutes for drinks to come to the table. They seemed super busy, which I understand, but I still don't like waiting that long for drinks. 

The floor wait/bust staff are great...kudos to them. They are constantly running around filling requests. If you can catch one of them, they might even take an order and bring you a receipt to pay later, which is a great option!

I ordered the Caesar Salad with their grilled lime-tofu (you can add any protein to anything). They said they were out of romaine, which was fine with me because they offered to substitute with kale. Bonus! However, when my meal came, there was no kale on it...let down. Salad was good, but small. The helping of tofu was generous; the tofu is lightly baked and I think marinated in their lime dressing.  

I love the idea of place, but I think on weekends they need more people working the order counter. I plan on coming back and giving this place another try."}
{"text":"I love the concept but the food was just average, the drinks took forever to come out, and I had to go home and eat a second lunch b/c the portions were so small, I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Super cute place with really good quality food. You can come here and feel good about what you're eating. The people were very nice and the ambience is really light and colorful and happy. The specialty beverages and waters are really good. I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since it opened. It has vegan and gluten free separate menus. The food tastes great (I usually order 2 entrees) and the service is just as good. I highly recomend it!!!!"}
{"text":"great concept!  In the heart of Green Valley, in the same center as Whole Foods and Settebello.  If you are looking for a healthy alternative then try some of their food and drinks.  My personal faves are the fish tacos (w/xtra salsa), grilled chicken sandwich, margarita pizza, and their drinks are awesome too.  Nice, clean, spacious, and nicely decorated.  Great place for a quick healthy meal."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is absolutely incredible! Healthy eats for an affordable price and excellent service. Try the buffalo chicken wrap as well as the orange ginger lyfe water... Dummy fire!!!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and all but it's hard to find anything on the menu that even sounds halfway appealing. Settled on just getting a fresh squeezed lemonade with pomegranate and ginger and boy they don't skip on the ginger at all. Not gonna lie might have been the first time in my life I didn't like a lemon adequate which is really saying something. Probably won't be coming back in just because I don't tend to enjoy hipster trendy places like this that overcharge for basic foods but if you are into that kind of stuff I guess you could try it just not worth it to me at all."}
{"text":"Healthy AND Delicious. Need I say more? The staff is super friendly and the menu has everything that you want, whether your are GF, Veggie or eat whatever. They even have a few good beers on tap. Great atmosphere, great food. Exactly the type of place that needed to move to Henderson. I will be back."}
{"text":"I don't normally enjoy ordering in so when I do I try to be as healthy as possible. New to the area and finally found something we can have delivered - that's healthy! 

Fairly priced for health food - we all know it can get up there. We ordered the Mahi Mahi sand which and burger with the Parmesan garlic fries (so, so, good). Ordered through BiteSquad FYI they do not deliver!

Tasted great, didn't feel like I digested a giant greaseball and delivered in an adequate amount of time. I may have found an excuse not to cook dinner :)"}
{"text":"New obsession. Such delicious tasting food and it is all relatively healthier. I have came here once before for lunch and loved it then. I came in for breakfast today and UGH so freaking good! I had a kale banana smoothie which I'm obsessed with. I had avocado and spinach frittata, also very flavorful and filling. I will be coming here a lot more often now."}
{"text":"Hey Lyfe Kitchen, Ikea called, they want their furniture back. I kid, I kid! The food was enjoyable....lighter fare that I didn't regret in the afternoon. I got the thai curry, which was good, and it had vegetables, so my wife will be proud of me. I'll probably try the fish tacos next time......and there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery, the food is good, the 3 stars are for the lack of desire to keep the food intact.

We got two orders of sweet chili tacos.  They do not use any mechanism to keep the Tacos intact during delivery, (toothpick or something), instead it looked like the just payed 3 tortillas on the bottom of the container overlapping each other and dumped the rest of the ingredients all over them.

Like I said the food was good just the presentation was very poor and it made for a huge mess of eating with a fork or trying to put them back together.

I would order from them again but next time pick it up so I can check them before I leave the store."}
{"text":"Great experience. Nice place with three different menus -- vegan, gluten-free, and \"everything.\" Friendly and non-pretentious. Ordering is done from a counter, very similar to that of a fast good place, but food is brought to your table once it's prepared.

A nice break from all the \"standard fare\" around the casino areas."}
{"text":"I had the art's unfried chicken, it was very delicious. Also tasted seasonal chicken and kale soup. Great food, friendly environment."}
{"text":"Order in lunch from LYFE time to time and the food is always solid.  Have had both the Farmhouse Burger and the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Sandwich.  Both with Sweet Potato Fries.  My absolute favorite item from their menu is the cucumber mint water.  Fantastic and refreshing on a hot day! If you're looking for a savory yet lower calorie and healthier option, LYFE Kitchen is a nice change of pace compared to most quick serve joints.  For a heath food option, the price is also really reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Friday. I actually come here pretty frequently when I want to eat something, but not feel sleepy or fat and gross.

Environment: I really like the natural lighting this place brings. Everyone that goes here looks like they just came from Pilates or yoga, which really makes you feel good about yourself too. This place makes a good spot to eat and chat with friends, maybe about your new exercise plan, or to catch up on some work you may have fallen behind on.

Service: everyone here is super friendly. I really liked our waitress, I came here on Friday with a pretty large party and she really did her best to get all of our food out on time. Some of the foods that took longer, she would bring my friends their sides like sweet potato fries so they can behind munching a little early. She also got me my water even though I was a few steps from the fountain. 

Drinks: they have a variety of healthy mocktail drinks which I have tried all of and felt rejuvenated from (could just be in my head). They also have a water fountain that allows you to select sparkling, ambient and cold water. (Hint: if you want to lose weight, drink sparkling water, makes you full)

Food: everything here is super healthy. They have a variety of options. I have had their pasta, which was good, but the turkey ball was a little dry. Their fried chicken with Brussels sprouts are also very good, but I wouldn't say it taste better than a greasy chicken. Their tuna tacos also taste really good, and had a perfect light sear and complexion to it. 

Overall, I really like this spot for its overall healthiness. They have vegan options, delicious healthy drinks, and pretty good food as well. When you've been eating bad all week or feeling like you should work on getting a nice bod and clearer skin, this is the perfect spot to get your grub on!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place. I am really glad I did! I ordered unfried buffalo strips and a goat cheese and mushroom flat bread. Both were delicious! I am an avid classic ranch dipper when I have chicken but their sauce was super good.  I will definitely be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Third time was not the charm unfortunately. It was 2 pm on a Sunday; not very crowded. Ordered at the register with a 20% tip. Waited a very long time for server to bring ice teas. Mine spilled as I slid it across the uneven edges of the two tables butted together. I had to get up in search of napkins. The drinks arrived just before the food. Not good timing for thirsty customers. The unfried Buffalo chicken strips were lukewarm, and they forgot my order of garlic Parmesan potato fries. When those finally arrived, they were room temperature and bathed in puddling oil.  Maybe the manager or cook had the day off. This place will have to live up to its self-proclaimed excellence by providing more consistent food and service."}
{"text":"Looking forward to coming here every time we are in LV/Henderson. Amazing food all day and excellent service. A treat every time."}
{"text":"I live nearby and have ordered Uber Eats delivery from here before and the food has always been very good so my girlfriend and I decided to visit for lunch.  It was about 2:30 and there was only one other couple in the entire place.  Our sandwiches took over 15 minutes to come out, I was just about to get up and ask what happened to them when they came.  I got the chicken avocado sandwich.  A few bites in I wondered where the avocado was so I took it apart.  The picture makes it look even bigger than it was, which was not even the size of my pinky finger.  Absolutely pathetic.  My girlfriend said her panini was VERY oily.  We won't be coming back.  Where was the manager when our order was over 15 minutes in?  There's too many dining choices in this area for this place to be sub-par."}
{"text":"My regular breakfast joint! Great food and great service."}
{"text":"Love this healthy food restaurant in Henderson.  They have a water bar that offers 3 variations; small quirk, but I love the detail.  Their coffee is great, and they have unique healthy options that cater to those wishing to feel good after their meal.  I think it's safe to say anyone can find something they like on their menu."}
{"text":"Beautiful place and great location! 
We were headed to Whole Foods to get food to take out but saw this, yelped it, & gave it a try. 
First thing that I saw was the outside tables with umbrellas which was a plus. Went in and was amazed by the decoration. I love how they have live herbs in the center. The menu lets you know the food is Vegan, Gluten Free, & if it contains nuts.

We ordered Classic Breakfast and Spinach & Avocado Frittata! It was a great choice to try this place out. First bite was awesome on our palates! 
Coming back to this place again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Since I've discovered this place, I find myself wanting to go there regularly. I always order more than one dish but I never feel leaving full and disgusted with myself. It's kind of amazing how that works. The Quinoa pancakes with blueberries is a must. They are light but there is no compromise on the flavor. Love them. The Breakfast Burrito is another favorite which I find myself wanting regularly these days. You can't go wrong here . . ."}
{"text":"Really wanted to give this place 4 or 5 stars, but maybe I had high expectations for it.  I ordered the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and grass fed beef burger. Both were just ok. The chicken and the burger was dry and honestly tasted like from frozen to grill. The sweet potato fries were more edible. I don't mind paying more for healthy fast food, but what I ordered  was not fresh tasting at all. The bread was wheat, but even that was dry and crumbly. I might come back to try something else in the menu, but will not be in a rush to do so. There's a Whole Foods in the same parking lot, so I ended up going there and getting some ready made hot food to go."}
{"text":"The food was so disappointing. I had the BBQ chicken flat bread and my bf had a grilled chicken avocado sandwich. We ate it quickly to not waste food and money. We just left there and drove to El Pollo Loco so we can be satisfied  with our food. Eff this place. SkinnyFats is way better and cheaper!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a try for dinner and we weren't disappointed. Unless there has been a change to their menus I am not certain how the prices could be a surprise since they were printed clearly on the menus. The prices range from about 8.00-15.00 for sandwiches and entrees, which was less expensive than I had been expecting.

I had the roasted mushroom and goat cheese flatbread which was excellent. The whole wheat crust was amazing and the goat cheese and balsamic were not overwhelming. My husband had the grilled chicken and avocado sandwich which he declared to be delicious. The service was top notch but that is to be expected from a new restaurant. If I have one complaint it would be that the restaurant was a little warm. It didn't bother me as much as my husband but I do think they could greatly benefit from either stronger sun shades or fans."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but this place gets more dysfunctional and food less and less tasty at each visit. Wish they would get it together! I love the concept and ingredients!!! Brussels sprouts side and sweet potato fries were downright gross this past visit. Sprouts were under cooked and bland and sweet potato fries limp and cold. :("}
{"text":"Had BQQ chicken salad. Food is always fresh , staff is always friendly . Reasonably priced fresh ingredients . My go to for breakfast and lunch ."}
{"text":"Great place!  Love the food and the atmosphere.  Whoever owns this place is pretty smart to place it in front of a Whole Foods.  

I ordered Art's Unfried Chicken.  I know there's a lot of reviews on this dish, but I'll break it down:

1) Veggies:  Roasted Butternut Squash and Brussel Sprouts - DELICIOUS!  Perfectly cooked, especially the squash.  It's finished with a dijon vinaigrette that is a perfect complement to the veggies.

2) Cashew Cream Sauce:  I could eat a bowl of the stuff.  It almost has a savory creamed corn type of flavor.  I loved dipping my chicken in it.  

3) Chicken: Crispy, tender and juicy!  You can't really ask for much more. 

I'm definitely looking forward to exploring more of the menu.

My only little warning which was not a factor in my rating was the water station.  You have three taps to choose from.  I chose the chilled sparking, but my warning is to be gentle.  The water comes out of that tap fast and powerful."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! I don't understand why people are complaining about the portions. It's perfect and it's called portion control. Some of Us Americans are eating way too much than we should that's why America has the highest obesity in the world... This is a perfect healthy place to dine :)"}
{"text":"I had been in Kingman all week and unless you eat garbage you will starve so when I got back to Vegas I found this place and was so glad I did!
Great location, very spacious, open and folks were 9 out of a 10 friendly.
After reviewing all pics posted I went with the crunchy quinoa wrap and sweet potato fries to go. 
The food was delicious, fries were a tad burnt.
I didn't give them 5 stars for two reasons, I had to ask for the chipotle sauce for the fries, it was not offered, and then they gave me vinegar dip.... Luckily the cashier caught it, and the bathrooms need a good clean, they weren't busy so maybe put them on bathroom duty? 
When I come back to town I will be back!"}
{"text":"Lyfe kitchen is amazing! I have been here several times now and it never disappoints! Food is awesome and the service is great! The manager Dave goes above and beyond to make sure you have the best dining experience! He's the man! I definitely recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried it yet!"}
{"text":"Can I give this place a zero? They were out of all beers on tap except for one - which they didn't advise us if until AFTER we paid. So we settle for a shitty beer. Then my kale and cranberry salad arrives with 75% romaine. Really? That's how you cut costs! The manager was inexplicably unapologetic -says \"well there is some kale in your salad\". Will never return. No loss here!!"}
{"text":"First time at Lyfe. 

Pros - had the grassfed burger it tasted great . Didn't have all the preservatives and other crap other burgers are made with (Mando burger from Good Burger) haha
Very clean place ,friendly staff, and nice ambience. Lots of menu options for healthy eating. Pricing was fair 

Cons-  came off as \"kinda\" Hollywood. Their was some saddity , uppity, snobby people in there. I saw some botched plastic surgery patients In there. I swear a guy sitting right next to my table looked like \"Bruce Jenner\" . I decided to have a beer with my healthy burger because well I CAN DAMNIT ! But a few patrons gave me the odd look because it wasn't 12pm yet haha  



Either way,  great experience I'll give them a second chance."}
{"text":"I tried this location by suggestion and I'm glad I finally went. When you eat out sometimes you feel like crap because you feel heavy and gross but not this place. 

Corner location on opposite side of Green Valley and District. You order your food and seat yourself. They give you a number to place on your table. I don't know if they are functional but the numbers are like those puck looking things that restaurants give you and if it vibrates and/or lights up your order is ready. Well it doesn't do the whole vibrate light thing and so when the ppl bring your food it's kind of hard for them to see if you are the correct number cause it's a flat thing sitting on the top of your table 

Well anyway onto the food. I had the Mahi tacos. I enjoyed them. They had some of the chipotle sauce which gave it a little kick. It was a nice size piece of fish and 2 was perfect for me. My friend had the chicken mushroom spinach penne. Hers was good and just clean flavors to taste each item not in heavy sauce. I would get it if I want more comfort food pasta. We shared the garlic sweet potato fries which I recommend. They were flavorful but I usually like fries a little more crispy. I'm sure the extra crispy is more fatty anyway so I would keep it the original way. We also got a cucumber water which was refreshing. 

Nice for a light healthy tasting and feeling dinner. My hunger was satiated with the portions I had. They have patio seating and I saw one tv. Also they had white flowers with blue dyed water so cute thing they are doing to show the flowers soaking up the colors. 

I would eat here again. I hear their breakfast is good so maybe next time!!"}
{"text":"Food is average. Nothing exciting at all about it. Service is below par. Great location. I think the challenge with the food is you can stamp things organic and still load them up with sugar and salt and processed carbs etc. this is where these guys fail for me."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place , kitchen staff super fast. Cashiers are extremely friendly and helpful. I had the quinoa salad it was just OMG!! Highly recommend this please"}
{"text":"I had a garden burger and it was really good. I don't care for the little green side salad that comes with it. I love the clean and chill atmosphere. The staff was very friendly. I would return at some point. I think they are on the pricey side. My burger was $8.79 and I wish it included sweet potato fries. I like that they don't have soda here so they definitely stick to healthier choices."}
{"text":"stopped by here and ordered take out. instead of of a chicken wrap, they gave me a quinoa wrap...so i paid extra for something i didn't even want. not only that, this location is 30 mins out from where we were headed so it was too late to even bring it back. lame."}
{"text":"So I am a regular LYFE Kitchen customer, here in Henderson and in Culver City.  I'm a big fan, appreciate having a healthy, quality place for food when I'm in town. But today I got a Farmhouse Burger and a market salad.  Burger was excellent as always.  Market wassooo small I would have felt ripped off at half the price; but at $9 a handful of greens, one Brussels sprout, 4 or 5 chunks of butternut squash with their excellent dressing left feeling used at best.
If you know better, do better!"}
{"text":"Really like the feel of the place. Cool contempo styling. The food portions are small compared to other spots but then again this is Vegas lol. I have tried a number of items here and its all pretty good. Not a bad option for healthy ish food in Green Valley Ranch."}
{"text":"I love this place. Super healthy options with a lot of variety. I love their breakfast the most! You have a repeat customer for life."}
{"text":"Such a breath of fresh air! I love the food here, tried the fish tacos and the vegan burger. Very friendly staff, and they cater to you--I was going up for a water and utensils, and someone offered to get it for me (: feels good to be pampered!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place for many reasons and I give this place a very solid three stars:

a. Location - How can you beat such a perfect location in the District of Green Valley with decent parking, plenty of seating in and out?  It is a really great location.

b. Menu - They have five menus? Gluten?  Veggie? Eat Everything, Alcoholic Mess? and if you like Seasonal foods,  you name it, they have it. That is so cool.

c. Prices - Reasonable.  Not cheap, reasonable. You're not paying for Whole Foods type of pricing.

d. Portions - Ahhh, the reason why everything here is so low in calories. The portions are very controlled. Some of you will like that and some of you will feel malnourished. It is all up to your perspectiive.

e. The Food - 

Ravioli - I think you get 5 pieces of Ravioli that is great in presentation and unremarkable in taste. Overall very edible, the sausage is a vegetarian option and the wife enjoyed it. She does also like top ramen noodles.....

Fish Tacos - My son ordered this and you get two pieces of taco with Mahi. Also edible, and good tasting. 

Kale Caesar Salad - Added salmon to this for additional protein.  My daughter enjoyed it and I found it to be okay. The salmon was good although I am not sure how it was cooked. .Seemed to be lightly fried or have a bit of a crust on it.

Grass Fed Steak - I ordered this and for 17.99.  I was okay with it.  There is nothing fantastic about the taste of grass fed beef. The entire dish was decent in taste, not great in texture and tenderness, but certainly edible.  The only issue is that it disappeared rather quickly. I think that this may have been a 4 ounce steak prior to cooking and somehow it ended up being 2-3 ounces. That is great for a Martini, but for a steak.....

Garlic Parmesan Sweet Potato Fries  - Loved it!

f.  Serve yourself - You order from the cashier, they give you a locator and you sit down. You can help yourself to water or sparkling water and utensils and etc.  I like this a lot and you control your refills.  The servers will bring you out the food and their service and awareness is certainly 5 stars to me!

Why is this a three star?  Well, this is a SOLID three star. It is more like 3.5 star.  Love the menu and presentation.  Just that the taste of the food was okay and the only issue is that they kept opening the door to the patio and left it open for long periods of time.  I don't like flies bothering me while eating and that fly was absolutely annoying.

GK says, check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. The menu sounds delicious. The food was very fresh but did not pack a punch of flavor. The cucumber mint water and sweet potato fries were very good. The quinoa crunch wrap was mostly lettuce and I saw very little quinoa. The corn chowder was good, but it's not something I'd crave and go back there for. This place wasn't bad, it just didn't leave a lasting impression."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday, 12/24 to be exact. Restaurant itself is pretty big they also have patio seating. You walk up to the counter and place your order and they bring you your food. Since it was a Sunday, they had their weekend brunch menu available. My boyfriend & I ordered mimosas, blueberry quinoa pancakes and the breakfast burrito sub tofu for egg. The cashier asked if we wanted to splurge for a $20 bottle of champagne and a carafe of OJ. If I didn't have to drive to California after, we would've been up for the deal.
When the food came out, the pancakes were beautiful and the burrito was colorful. The pancakes were DELICIOUS. Yup, they were heavenly. Texture wasn't grainy which is what I expected since they are made out of quinoa. The burrito was okay, nothing out of the ordinary for a veggie breakfast burrito, but we will definitely be back for those pancakes!"}
{"text":"Love this place it's both healthy and delicious with a casual laid back atmosphere. Food is amazing! I have never had anything that didn't taste delicious."}
{"text":"Ok. I've gone twice. I'm fine paying their expensive prices because the food is good. My problem is lack of consistency. The first time I went the lemonade had mint leaves in it, second time it didn't. First time the brownie gelato dessert was in a martini glass with a huge square brownie cut into triangles. The second time it was tiny and was a brownie bite and they'd added mint to it. First time? The pork tenderloin (listed as having a cumin-coffee rub) wasn't spicy. Second time it was pretty spicy. Good food. Nice atmosphere. My roommate orders a lot from uber eats for delivery. The food is always good but again....they need to be consistent. The first time I went, someone I was with (who is gluten free) asked if the cookies were gf. The waitress said yes and she'd bring some. Well, she never returned. So we went up to ask and was told 'yea, they're not gluten free she didn't mean to say that but instead of coming to tell you she just wasn't going to go back to your table cause she thought you guys were done'......wait. What? Also, you have to ask staff to take away dishes from your table because they all must have some kind of vision impairment that makes them blind to dirty plates."}
{"text":"Awesome gluten and dairy-free menu choices. The sweet potato fries are to die for and I hate sweet potatoes! Lol Beautious and clean patio for outdoor dining. Great staff. And fun \"LYFE Quotes\" on the walls to keep you entertained on the way to the restroom. ;)"}
{"text":"Fresh outta the gym and feeling body cocky enough to finally start a healthy diet? Come here!!! 

Food is on the pricier side but it tasted clean and fresh! I still felt pretty body cocky walking out of this joint even after a meal! 

The side of Brussels sprouts were mustardy-delicious! I would've never thought that cranberries, yams, Brussels sprouts, and a mustard sauce would compliment each other so smoothly! Learn something new everyday, with each culinary dish! 

Service was a little bland, the cashier didn't really seem to care, he had that \"I'm just going to do my job and not care to interact with anyone\" type of attitude, which is fine! Small talk is outta the question then I guess."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed both of my visits to Lyfe Kitchen.  The cater to health-minded people of several dietary preferences including vegan and gluten-free. The decor is bright, cheery and fresh. A partition of fresh grown herbs are the first thing that catches the eye;  a promise of the fresh, healthy ingredients to come when your dish arrives. The crunchy quinoa salad and the antipasto salads were my selections on my two visits. Both were appealing to the eye and the pallette. Classic and surprising vegetables were featured in each satisfying salad. Service was prompt and friendly.  Great place to meet for business or with friends. I look forward to diving into the menu again and on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Gluten free menu is extensive and very tasty. Price point is a little expensive but worth it.  They have sparkling water on tap for free. Restaurant is clean and the staff is very efficient.  I suggest the gluten free bbq chicken pizza."}
{"text":"This was so refreshing! Loved it I had the pizzadillawich and a cucumber mint life water:) so good the salad with my dish was a little sour but went great with the dish. My husband said his pasta, the chicnken mushroom and spinach penne had everything he loves in it. Lunch was great!"}
{"text":"The concept is great. I love the idea of healthy eating.  The ingredients are fresh, calorie conscious and friendly for vegan, vegetarian and gluten free diets.
Nothing I have tried here is mind blowing.  Actually, everything I have had here is meh, but I do appreciate the effort of putting forth healthy choice meals.  Here's a breakdown of what I've tried:
- Quinoa buttermilk pancakes w/ blueberries
- Potato hash 
- Buffalo chicken wrap
- Garden burger
- Baked sweet potato garlic parmesan fries
- Ginger pomegranate lemonade
- Orange ginger chia LYFE water
The food was bland. The buffalo did not resemble or taste like it was supposed to. More southwestern or tex mex-ish. The side kale salad was way too lemon-y. I really wanted to try the beet lyfe water, but they were out. I would probably reorder the sweet potato fries and the orange ginger chia lyfe water."}
{"text":"After a weekend of eating Vegas food Lyfe kitchen was just what the doctor ordered.  Every item at this eatery is fresh and prepared with excellence.  From fresh juices, healthy breakfast options and an even better lunch menu we thought the two meals we ate were among some of our favorites in a weekend that involved too much eating.  

The classic breakfast and breakfast wrap with potatoes were a great way to start the day. The chicken breast and Buffalo wrap were a delicious lunch.  Plenty of vegan options if that floats your boat and an added bonus was the chilled and mineral water on tap."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have no complaints I live really close so it's convenient. The crunch bowl salad is awesome I add chicken to it. There veggie burger awesome! There drink waters are great too. Haven't tried there breakfast items but can't wait to try there spinach frittata"}
{"text":"Awesome healthy lunch spot! Totally worth checking out if you're in town. Almost everyone eating here just came from working out. Infused drinks with fresh meals!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time with my cousins. They have a menu for nearly everyone's dietary needs; whether you're vegan or gluten free, they've got you covered! I had the fish tacos which were absolutely delicious! I also had the garlic sweet potato fries and the mango cucumber line smoothie...it was all great! The sweet potato fries came with this spicy chipotle aioli sauce which was just perf! Since all of us got something different we were all able to try a little bit of everyone's food. What I liked most about the food is that there seemed to be a ting a spicyness to the dishes which was pleasantly surprising because I'm a girl who loves a little kick to her food! The dining area is really light and fresh with lovely decor and comfortable seating. They also have a nice patio area with plenty of musters for those hot Vegas days. This place is just all around great! I will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Lyfe kitchen is located in Henderson district in between whole foods and the Cheesecake Factory. I wanted a healthy Saturday morning breakfast that would cost under 10.00. I waited in line briefly to order food I greeted by the friendly cashier. I ordered the quinoa pancakes with berries and Greek yogurt I was asked by the cashier if I wanted blueberries inside the cakes as well as on top. The cashier didn't inform me hi I assumed having blueberries inside the pancakes would be extra it was .99 extra no big deal. Blueberries and blackberries and Greek yogurt topped the cakes. I also had the ginger mint chia water. Both items were excellent."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience here. It was my first time here with two others and we waited 45 mins for our food. When we received it, my fries were cold and very mediocre for paying $2.50 extra for them and everyone else's food was average for the price and the wait. We complained to a couple of employees and they simply just apologized for the wait and didn't do anything else about it. We then complained to the manager and she also apologized and asked if there was anything she could do for us but I don't think we will go back there again."}
{"text":"The food is fresh
The place is clean
The staff is good
The place is empty on a Sunday morning
Why?
The place is a rip off.
I ordered an omelet it came with 1 slice of toast.
I asked for the other slice and they charged me $2.17 for 1 slice of bread.
REALLY???? WTF!
Im in the food business 25 years.
Now i know why the place is empty on a Sunday. And rightfully so.
I cannot wait to see these doors close.
Maybe a better business will come in and will be more of a better use to the community."}
{"text":"Wow... I'm surprised to see some not so spectacular reviews... I love this place. The decor works for me and everything I've had is delish. Service is always on point. Make sure you get the orange chia water. Its soooo yummy. Now granted I've only had 2 appetizers (they're so good I was never able to get anything else) they are amazing. The gardein lettuce wraps and the Brussel sprouts & squash. So good & vegan"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The portions are a good size, I got the Farmer's Market salad with chicken, and enjoyed it. The food and decor both are fresh and clean. They have a water station where you have an option for cold, room temp, or sparkling which was a nice touch. I would definitely go back. Very friendly service!"}
{"text":"Perfect location, fresh food, maybe-a-little-too-small-of-portions.

Just outside of the Henderson Whole Foods, LYFE Kitchen is the ideal restaurant to be found. Before going on our weekly shopping trip today, we decided to walk a few steps over to grab a bite to eat. I ordered the vegan thai curry bowl and a hibiscus tea while my beau ordered the grass-fed burger and a cafe mocha. 

The drinks: to die for. I found the hibiscus tea extremely flavorful and refreshing, and he found the cafe mocha tasty and (as he was hoping) energizing. The meals: small portions, decent flavor. My vegan thai curry bowl tasted great but was a little more spicy than I was prepared for. It also could have stood for more wheatberries and a little more tofu, as well, rather than so many filler vegetables. His grass-fed burger was good and had a slight hickory flavor. 

At the conclusion of the meal, though, we were still kind of hungry and were left wishing there was more food on each plate. I was also left with two questions: Is the tofu organic? What about the grass-fed beef? If not, then I don't see the point of coming to a restaurant that is marketed as health-conscious to eat conventionally grown soy and meat - yuck!

We may return to try a couple of the other menu items, but next time it won't be when we're super hungry!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place.  it's the closest thing to Paleo I have found.  The food is pretty good, healthy and quick.  A winning combination.

I will definitely return until I've tried everything on the menu that's GF, then I'll start again!

Why they don't have GF pasta is a mystery.  Owners if you are reading this Jovial brand is THE best GF pasta out there.  Get some!"}
{"text":"Used to be good. After a few years of frequenting, the quality of food has decreased dramatically as of last year. This year, even worse. Friendly staff, albeit short on staff or knowledgeable staff, the rare knowledgeable staff does not make up for their consistent inconsistent deliverables. Carry-out has repeatedly been the worst in declining quality (ie. taste & correct order). I have faith they can pull themselves together again"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to sit down with friends and have a little something something. Food is okay. There is a whole foods place next door that has better chow in their food court. So if you feel like showing off and pretending your healthy to eat in one of Hendersons  A+ area this is the place brah!"}
{"text":"Cool ambience, inside is really open and clean. I liked the herbs wall and cute wooden tables. My fiancé and I had the mint cucumber water, margherita pizza, chunky guacamole, farmers market salad and grain bowl. The pizza was nice and light, guacamole and salsa were really good (not the chips it came with though), the salad looked nice and summer-y with black berries, candied walnuts, goat cheese and arugula. The balsamic vinaigrette was not over bearing on the salad. The grain bowl had a nice spice to it. The menu has prices and also indicates that veggies are undercooked to be nice and crunchy texture. Overall, we enjoyed the meal and great hospitality. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Wow so bummed. 
Went in and got a fish taco after young lady at the counter said they were the resturants most popular diah.
It was yumm.
and then I got violently iLL, about 2 hours later. ( I did not have breakfast so that the fish taco was all I had in my belly).

Called to let them know they should pull the fish dish, no answer.
I wrote to them, but it said via Yelp they don't respond to messages...so how to warn the shop and other customers???  This is the only way sadly...

Such a nice place, clean and great menu. It was my first visit, and probably my last."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after going to my insurance agency.

I tried the egg sandwich and ginger pomegranate lemonade. 

Love the food. Love the interior. 
Love the music choice!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Seventh time today was a freebie taste test Facebook offer. We grabbed at it without hesitation and were not disappointed! Two of us tried the salmon, butternut squash dish and I had the Parmesan crusted chicken platter. All were delicious and quite colorful. Thank you Lyfe Kitchen Corp. for a great FREE meal. Looking forward to frequenting your restaurant again soon."}
{"text":"bomb.com healthy fresh yummy food, with gluten free options. yay!"}
{"text":"I have ordered here several times, although annoyingly inconsistent in quality, they are still awesome! And when ordering online or by phone - CHECK YOUR ORDER when you pick it up. I have left too hastily and realized they forgot not one, but a few items. 
They are very friendly here and the manager is very good to her customers. My gf loves this place because it serves all the weird leaves, roots, sprouts, tubers and healthy ingredients she eats. I, on the other hand, love their organic burger! I get a double patty with cheddar. It is amazing. I highly recommend the scrumptiously delicious Parmesan Sweet Potato Fries. They are so good served fresh. Packed with parmesan and buttery flavor. Beware...You only get like 10 fries...so restrain yourself and eat slowly or they will disappear very quickly. The desserts are actually very good...just too small for my liking. Trust me, try one. But get two. Thats my motto here...'Try one, but get two'"}
{"text":"They have the most delicious chicken Chipada sandwich with pesto avocado sauce delicious salads love the place love the ambience"}
{"text":"Everything was lovely at this restaurant. The first visit I had the hummus appetizer and the lettuce wraps, not too bad but nothing amazing. The second visit I had their vegan burger, it was good, but nothing amazing.

I love that they offer vegan options and I love that they offer organic options. Try their chia seed fruit infused water, it's very refreshing. The best thing about this restaurant are their vegan cookies, oh my gosh, they are so delicious and freshly baked.

YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 STARS, but I can't. Let me start by saying the salad/soup/sandwiches and hibiscus iced tea tasted great. I really was surprised on how nice the atmosphere was. We needed a spot like this in Vegas desperately. We are also desperate for a place like this in the Summerlin area. 

But it doesn't matter how great your food is for me if your staff serving the food looks very dirty with dirty fingernails literally touching the arugula in the my salad while taking it off his serving tray, and then serving my boyfriends coffee while holding the rim of the glass. He also proceeded to wipe his nose all of his hands after sitting down our food. It was a big turn off. It's strange because another girl that was serving the drinks/food came out with gloves on serving everything, so I'm not sure why this guy did not have gloves on, but he definitely should have, it was gross. 

I will definitely come back to try your place again, but please have the servers be more sanitary I don't want to get sick."}
{"text":"I have ordered take-out from Lyfe Kitchen several times, but this was my first experience in the restaurant. The location is awesome!--walking distance to Whole Foods, Pilates, and GVR.  It is very neat and clean with large windows! The staff is very attentive and knowledgable. They even have quality water that is complimentary. i love the healthy and delicious food options! We ordered the corn chowder, quinoa crunch bowl, and back bean burger. Everything was phenomenal! We will be back very soon!"}

- Light food. Expensive pricing. 
- Taste-less entrees: Buffalo chicken wrap and penne. STAY AWAY. Penne entree should be placed in the soup section. Disgusting!

- Garden burger was flavorful and crunchy. Enjoyed.
- Cups looked recycled. There is this weird line as if they fused 2 together.

{"text":"I've had the fish tacos... Really good, and the kale Cesar salad with salmon... Really really good! I love that it's super healthy and the calories are on the menu. The only reason it didn't get a 5 is because there's no soda! It's a little over-priced too but I'll eat here when I feel like being very healthy."}
{"text":"LYFE is all about perspective. How you view it can be positive or negative depending on what you value. I've been on a feasting spree on my recent vacation and it's time to get back on track. 

I happen to enjoy LYFE a lot. They have nutritious food that are at the same time delicious. I've convinced my sister to come here with me and for her to say \"if all healthy meals taste like that, it would be easy to eat healthy all the time.\" For her to say that is a bold statement since she loves fast/junk food. Healthy food doesn't have to be expensive nor does it have to taste like torture or cardboard.

Grilled Artichokes:
Comes with aioli. Simple seasonings but grilling makes anything taste better. 5/5

Baked Garlic Parmesan Sweet Potato Fries:
I don't find joy in eating sweet potato. I can't fool myself by thinking sweet potato fries are better than regular fries. Plus, the flatulence after? No, thank you! However, these made me look at sweet potato differently. They are soooo good. Garlicky and has some grated Parmesan which is nice with the sweetness of the orange tubers. 5/5

Art's Unfried Chicken:
Comes with butternut squash, Brussels sprouts, cranberries, cashew cream and Dijon vinaigrette. The chicken has a nice crunchy crust to it and the meat itself is tender and isn't dry. The different colors, textures and flavors make this dish so vibrant. 5/5

Quinoa Crunch Bowl with Salmon:
Greens, quinoa, chipotle sauce, edamame hummus and cubes of salmon. The slight heat from the chipotle was a nice contrast from the cool edamame hummus. 4/5

Kale Banana Smoothie:
I didn't read the part where it says it has ginger in it. As soon as took a big sip, all I could taste was ginger! I read the menu again: \"raw kale, ginger, banana, cucumber, apple and lemon\"...oh, that's why! It's actually not bad - at least it doesn't taste like a freshly mowed lawn. 4/5

They cater to those with specific dietary needs and those who eat anything. They have separate menus for those who eat gluten-free, everything, vegan, etcetera. The place has a positive vibe to it with its modern decor, open spaces, flowers, artwork and quotes painted on the walls."}
{"text":"Lyfe kitchen located in the district (Whole Foods & settebellos side) is clean, healthy, sustained eating.  It's a walk up counter and order.  They bring the food to your table and have gluten free options on the bread.  Ordered the California sandwich on gf bread, arugula side salad, sweet potato fries with Parmesan, Baja fish tacos, chips & salsa, and the host recommended the ginger pomegranate lemonade.   The lemonade was very tart and woke up my senses.  It was delicious.  Sweet potato fries with the spicy dipping sauce was good.  Chips and salsa as well.  The California chicken sandwich was good.  The gluten free bread was good but bun was massive so only ate the bottom bun.  The Baja fish taco was nice as well but the portion was a little ok the small side.  The total meal was $32.  It was clean eating, portion size was decent except for the fish tacos.  For the price it should have came with 3 tacos.  But overall it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Sometimes a weekend getaway to Vegas is necessary. But then sometimes, Vegas is too much to handle and you gotta get away from the strip. So in our escape to Henderson, I discovered a Lyfe Kitchen.

I already frequent Lyfe Kitchen in LA. So why go to something familiar in another city? After a disappointing buffet experience on the strip, I wasn't up for a culinary gamble. I knew Lyfe Kitchen would be a safe bet.

Upon walking in, I grabbed the Vegan & Vegetarian menu for myself and handed the Everything menu to the meateater BF. The Quinoa Crunch Wrap caught my interest while the BF ordered something called Pizzadillawich. He also got us an order of the Baked Sweet Potato Fries. Let me start by saying, I've had many a sweet potato fry. But I think I can safely say that this was one of my favorites. It had a hint of garlic which made it so addicting. Yum! http://bit.ly/1G5ldO7

My Quinoa Crunch Wrap totally hit the spot! Filled with quinoa tabbouleh, veggies, lots of avocado, and edamame hummus. It also came with hot sauce and a side of salad. So good! http://bit.ly/1wPPwlG

We also got the Vegan Unfried Buffalo Gardein Chick'n Strips. It pretty much seemed like gardein chick'n tossed in buffalo sauce. Not really my fave and I wish it had a crispier crust. I've had better at Veggie Grill in LA but at least Lyfe Kitchen's still tastes good (I've also had worse at a place in Burbank that shall remain unnamed). The saving grace for this dish was the side of sliced sweet pickles. http://bit.ly/13qY4qc

I liked two out of the three vegan dishes we ordered and the BF seemed to enjoy his Pizzadillawich. I think that's worth 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"Plenty of healthy choices for everyone. Vegetarian, gluten free and \"meat eaters\" too. Salads are fresh and good juice mixes. Champagne and wine also available. 

Wish they had a frequent diner reward plan. 

Patio with misters available."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this spot but I left the location extremely disappointed. I'm an easy-going guy who usually doesn't complain, but the service was slow, the staff was unfriendly, and the food was mediocre.

I also found it perplexing this place doesn't serve soda even though it offers coffee, tea, beer, wine, juices and smoothies. I'm sure it's because \"Lyfe Kitchen\" hails itself as a healthy dining option, but how do you offer beer and wine but not soda? 

The self-serve water station also lacks an ice machine and simply offers a small bucket of ice that only had 3 ice cubes inside during my visit. This isn't Europe, people! We Americans like our ice -- especially here in Vegas when it's 110 degrees outside... 

And while I'm no food and beverage expert, wouldn't this community ice bucket be a health code violation? What's there to prevent some sick guy from using his dirty hand to grab some ice directly from the bucket? 

Of larger importance than the lack of soda or ice, however, was the disappointing food... I shared a bunch of different items with three others and we had an issue with almost everything we ordered, starting with the sweet potato garlic Parmesan fries. They were limp, mushy, greasy and literally laying in a puddle of garlic oil. With that amount of oil, I highly doubt the fries contained the actual calorie count advertised on the menu.

The Buffalo chicken wrap also had no \"kick\" whatsoever and it was easily the blandest Buffalo wrap I've ever tasted. The staff also failed to ask us how we wanted the grass-fed burger cooked -- so it ended up being boring AND overcooked -- and the ingredients of the quinoa crunch wrap weren't evenly distributed. As a result, one bite would be all quinoa tabbouleh, the next bite would be all vegetables, etc.

I might give \"Lyfe Kitchen\" one more try, but everyone in my group agreed that it's no \"Greens & Proteins.\""}
{"text":"I'd heard such rave reviews before I came here, so I had some expectations built up.  For my taste, the serving sizes were a little small.  I had the veggie burger, which was good, but wasn't mind-blowing.  I like the location, so I'll likely be back with friends, and I'll try other foods, but as of this moment, it's not my favorite vegetarian-friendly place in town."}
{"text":"Having food allergies is no fun!  When I find a spot the truly caters to my needs it gives me a sense of peace knowing I can eat without being ill for 3 days following the meal.  This spot has a lot of options and caters to many dietary needs.  The food is fresh and the employees were really friendly and helpful.  The food was a little pricey but that's what you pay for when you have organic choices.  The food didn't blow my mind, it wasn't the best food I've ever had but it was good and appetizing.  I really enjoyed the flavor infused waters.  The place has a neat design element as well.  I had the tacos and the were delicious.  I would return and suggest others give it a try as well."}
{"text":"This place is DIRTY! Every table that we attempted to sit at was filthy. My silverware left little to be desired, but I might be being overly critical since I'm getting the dirty vibe.

The food was okay. I love that it's healthy and enjoyed the quinoa pancakes.

They have fresh o.j. and several different wines but no champagne! What's fresh o.j. without champagne?!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars but there was a tiny issue, my chicken,  mushroom and spinach penne that i took to go had no pasta in it. It was delicious though. I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager Eric and he totally made it right. Thank you Eric."}
{"text":"I love everything's about this place.  
Note, it is healthy and delicious food. 
If you are looking for hearty, greasy traditional food- this is NOT for you. 
I love their sweet potato fries with their lunch dishes and their breakfast is yum. Try their pancakes and skillet.  
They could have a few more selections and you definitely pay more to eat healthy but I love going here."}
{"text":"Cucumber infused Water is Fantastic!!! The fish tacos were Excellent as well & Not Breaded which keeps it Clean & simple. Nice fast delivery to table & good atmosphere :) I'll be back for sure ! 

Approx: $10 tacos
Water :$3.75"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! When I hear a place is healthy, I think Oh No! Its probably tasteless or tastes like weeds and tree bark. I was wrong.
We got their food for a catered school (University) lunch.
Started with some KALE CAESAR SALAD, that by itself was enough to go back. But I also tried the QUINOA CRUNCH WRAP and the GRILLED CHICKEN & AVOCADO WRAP and  MARGHERITA PASTA with huge chunks of mozzarella. Everything was flavorful and delicious. There was nothing weird about any of the food.
Prices are a bit high but your paying for quality, fresh product. I would recommend trying this place even if your not the health conscious type."}
{"text":"Healthy cucumber mint water is a lovely beverage option. Eggplant curry was pretty tasty but they need to expand the vegetarian menu. The fact that I even ordered that option is a little bit disappointing because that's the type of dish you can get at any Thai place. I hope they will add some more enticing veggie dishes soon. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"We had to-go lunch: I had the vegan untried buffalo chicken strips, edamame/hummus/veggie/crisps and both types of the budino. 

I didn't care for the chicken at all and the chocolate budino was awful. The other 2 ladies liked the chicken but we were in total agreement about the chocolate desert. However, the banana budino was super yummy! The flavor/texture reminded me of arroz com leche with banana goodness mixed in. It was absolutely delightful :) 

While the veggies were yummy and fresh and the hummus was good; the smokey paprika golden flax seed crisps stole the light :) 

Absolute must: banana budino and the veggie/hummus/crisp platter"}
{"text":"Im really disappointed with this place.  After seeing the menu and the location it was in, I was really excited to try it. But I soon found that the portion sizes are small and expense. I get that healthy eating is expensive but $9.50 for a burger, and an extra $2 for a side of (burnt) fries? I dunno, the good was good but I spent $30 on a burger for myself, a burger for my fiancé (with an extra patty), and a lemonade we shared. I wasn't really impressed and I won't be back. However, the staff was really nice and quick with the food, but that just isn't enough to draw me back."}
{"text":"I loved this place but in the past few months it has really gone down hill and the menu is ever shrinking. If you have allergies DO NOT EAT HERE! My past three meals have contained mystery ingredients not listed on the menu like today a zucchini muffin full of carrots and raisins or previously breakfast potatoes covered in flavored mayonnaise. Oh and mint chia water with strawberries. I don't have many food allergies but this could be life threatening to not disclose ingredients to customers. The food is tasty you just play ingredient roulette."}
{"text":"This is a great healthy spot to try if you're in the Henderson area!

I tried the Fish tacos which were super fresh and delicious - they were made with corn tortillas and I ordered a side of steamed broccoli and snap peas which was a great compliment!

I would say their menu is very similar to Greens and Proteins with the ability to choose proteins, greens, and a side and mix and match. I like that they also have brunch options also.

The staff was friendly and the restaurant and facility was super clean overall!"}
{"text":"I was eagerly awaiting LYFE to open up. We need healthy places in Vegas desperately. Their menu is huge, healthy, flavorful, and appeals to all different cuisines and \"level\" of healthy eating. A vegan can eat next to a little kid here and that's amazing... and it's not that expensive! I LOVE life at LYFE Kitchen. For such a variety on the menu, all the food we've tried is delicious. More locations please!

Only problem, which is why I knocked off a star, is how long it takes to get the food. Third time I was there I ordered the avocado breakfast fritatta (could be butchering the spelling on that one, sorry) with only two other people in the restaurant and it look around 20 minutes to come out. It's taken fairly long to get my food during other times as well.

But keep up the good work LYFE!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to town and found this place the best in the area. I recommend the curry dish, BBQ flat bread and of course the date banana shake! Organic ingredients, pleasant ambiance and outside seating is lovely!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of true foods. Vegan friendly, organic and fresh. Yessssss. 

We literally came here twice in a row cause we love it so much. The ginger chia infuse water was so refreshing. I'm obsessed with the hummus with vegetables. It was so good. Didn't care too much about the lettuce wrap because I think they over cook the mock meat and added sauce to cover up how dry it was.  

OMGGGGG. MUST GET THE VEGAN CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE!!!!!"}
{"text":"love this place(: very atmospheric and you when you come here you have to get thr garlic sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"First time coming to Lyfe Kitchen today. My son has food allergies and all of their food is ok for him to eat. This is the reason we came. Food was super fresh. Service was good. Place was clean. People were nice. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I wanted to try LYFE Kitchen for a very long time, but it took me more than one year to convince my fiancé to try this place. In general, he is rather open minded towards healthy and vegetarian options. 

The other day I finally dragged him to LYFE Kitchen and I have to admit that he was right: The restaurant itself is cute and the patio area is a plus. I am even OK with ordering my food at the cashier desk like at McDonalds, but the food quality is the problem. Everything is prepared without love. There is no seasoning, no sauces nor any other flavor. The buns are dry. 

This kind of restaurants actually prove the anti-vegans right that healthy vegan food is not good and not worth trying. I was really hoping that this would be a place where I could bring my non-vegetarian friends and show them how good meatless healthy food can be! Bummer!

Ok, I give 1 star for the health-conscious idea + 1 star for the food + 1 star for the restaurant design.
But I recommend the fantastic Gardein Menu at Yardhouse instead!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had lunch the other day. I had the Fresh Market Salad and the Garlic Parm Sweet Potato fries.  He had the burger with fries.  

PRO's - prices are very reasonable. Portions are great and all the food is very fresh.  Appearance of the eatery is airy and brights

CON's - never heard of it.  Advertise more.  The room temperature was quite chilly.

Will we go back again?  Yes, we will.  Looking forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Love love love LOVE Lyft kitchen! Great food that is tasty and on the healthier side. You're greeted by a beautiful fresh herb wall near the entrance. Floor to ceiling windows create great natural lighting throughout the restaurant. And my favorite part about the decor, fresh flowers on each table. Try the quinoa crunch wrap or the curry. Just tried their new sweet potato and kale soup last night and it was so good!"}
{"text":"First time here and I enjoyed my meal. I had the farmhouse burger with garlic Parmesan sweet potato fries. Very tasty burger and the kale salad goes perfect with the burger. 
Very comfortable place to eat and enjoy a healthier option than most. 
Will return sooner than later"}
{"text":"I will say, this place is really clean and streamed lined. They have an okay menu and the atmosphere is hip I guess. I wasn't impressed and to be honest I don't have much to say other than they got my order wrong and when I brought it up to the servers attention, she kind of just meh. Offered to take the salad back with extreme hesitance. I bought a cup of coffee which tasted like run-off water from a previously brewed batch. You guys need to brew better coffee. I'm also tired of these places charging $15 dollars per person to dine. 5 Star fine dining I'll pay that per dish or more. Not a place I will be  returning."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and it's one of my favorite healthy food places to go to around my house. Love the location, across from GVR. 

I got the fresh squeezed pomegranate lemonade and the mahi fish tacos the first time I went. The second time I got the veggie burger. Both delicious! 

It's clean, bright and has modern decor. When you walk in there is a \"herb garden\" in the middle which I thought was a nice touch. 

Pros: all of their salads can be made gluten free or vegan upon request, the calories for each dish is displayed on their menu so they are easy to find, they do have a breakfast menu that is served daily until 11 am, sparklingly water on tap, and the service was good

Cons: the location is a bit tucked away and I didn't hear about this place from anyone I just happened to see it and walk in

Will I come back? Yes! Can't wait to try more dishes"}
{"text":"Awesome! Like it a lot. If you are vegan/vegetarian or planning to be you should totally eat here!"}
{"text":"I eat vegan and was so excited about this new restaurant. I had the quinoa crunch wrap and was underwhelmed. The distribution of ingredients was uneven and therefore, half the wrap was quite bland while the other half gushed out the flavorful hummus spread. I prefer the felafel vegan wraps at Zikis on the other side of the 215 freeway. Or load up on the salad bar at Whole Foods ($2 off per lb every Wednesday). My quinoa wrap was overpriced considering the serving size. Also, the vibe of the restaurant seemed a bit pretentious!"}
{"text":"Good, healthy food with generous portions. (One caveat: most dishes are a bit high in sodium, and no low-sodium choices offered.) Once you place your order, it takes 10-15 minutes for preparation.

One thing I really like is the self-serve water fountain, which has carbonated water, just like Perrier (IMHO)! Plain water available too.

Dislikes: tables close together and no carpeting makes for a VERY noisy space. When it's crowded, e.g., lunchtime, the ordering line moves slowly and the noise level is extreme. Also, as a fish lover, I find not enough fish choices on the menu; the main one is salmon. (Why, oh why, did they take the barramundi off the menu? It was so good!)

Prices are a bit high but not out of sight. I go there a couple times a month when I'm in Henderson and usually enjoy it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here last Sunday.

You stand to order, and they deliver to the table.

I ordered the \"Fried\" Chicken (it's not really fried here), with brussel sprouts and squash. ($13)

Comes to the table with a load of brussel sprouts, but no squash?

I ask the waiter: 'What happened to my squash?\"  \"I love squash!\"

He responds, \"They were out, \" and starts to walk away.

I grab him and tell him that I was Not told that when I ordered!

I was really looking forward to the squash--it was a  perfect combo.

He let me pick the baked sweet potato fries as a substitute. 
All fries should be prepared this way--they were excellent--not greasy.

I would return here for this meal again.

It's such a pleasant surrounding and atmosphere.
Very relaxing.

Easy large parking lot shared with Whole Paycheck."}
{"text":"I love coming here with the kiddos. Good food and kid friendly. they also have a pretty neat point program - you get the app and sign up and every $100 spent here gives you back a free entree.
Everything we had was good."}
{"text":"Every since they opened this has been one of my go to's. I love that they have sparkling water on tap! sparkling water... for free? You can't go wrong with that. The food is always good and there is basically something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"The food here is hit or miss. I've had some items like the burger and kale cesar salad which were really good. I've also had food from here that was not so great. They really lack flavor on a lot of their foods. I would say this place is average. I've had plenty of healthy food that was very flavorful but this place kind of makes you think all healthy food sucks. I think it is a great place to go if you are vegan since they have a ton of vegan options but other than that, I'd just stick to going to your favorite restaurant and ordering on the light menu."}
{"text":"Terrible service on a quiet Saturday morning. Half of our 5 person party was done eating by the time the rest got their food. Which only happened after we got up to ask where it was. Asked for an extra plate. Didn't come until we got up to ask. On top of it all, food completely tasteless. Don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"For the healthy eaters out there this is one a few locations that caters to you.  Food was good but not great.  Fresh but still with that hint that big business was lurking in a shadow.  We ordered the veg burger and tacos.  Each was unique, possessing an original flavor.  

Would definitely go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"It is a fabulous idea and I love the quotes on the wall. The customer service was good. The food was boring and had no flavor. I enjoyed eating outside on the patio."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot after the gym or for a guilt free girls lunch. 

There are plenty of options and most of the items can be modified to suit your dietary needs.   I actually had an allergy test done last year and had a whole list of items I couldn't have for the time being and the girl behind the counter went through each and every item (in a handy binder) that was in what I wanted to order. 

The food quality is always pretty good as well.   My mom even likes coming here with me and she's so picky!   

Now they have brunch on the weekends until 2pm and that is super tasty as well.   

Definitely order any item on the menu but I highly recommend the bowls and salads.   Very delicious!  They also have great sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Vegetarian-friendly with an amazing atmosphere. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I would like to see more out of this restaurant . Less salads and \"easy out\" low cal menu options. Give me something I can sink my teeth into- also please put a menu box at the door- even with paper menus- people need to be able to look at the menu in line (and the box with them in it is too far forward and always empty) or just put a menu board up! The water station is fun and trendy- the atmosphere is hip and cool- I had the salmon and corn soup- bothe highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I found this for lunch during a business trip. Unhealthy Business meals no more. I had the fish tacos and a great kale smoothie. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes flavor and nutrition."}
{"text":"LYFE Kitchen is typical california cuisine.  I had the Fish Tacos, and they were quite enjoyable.  I'm not usually as big of a fan as Fish Tacos as my friend, Mr. Booth (Mr. Booth LOVES Fish Tacos).  They were served with 2 tacos and a very small salad.  I think that the menu said it was about 400 calories, so it left me a little big hungry still.  For the price of $13, it was a bit expensive.

I also had an orange ginger drink that was good, but the jelly inside was a little bit weird.  A coworker of mine had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with avocado, which he really enjoyed.  I think that I may try that next.

LYFE kitchen will be a repeat, but not too often of a repeat.  It's probably really about 3.5 stars, but we'll round up for the good service."}
{"text":"I ate there today And I am so bloated from the foot I ate ... Doesn't feel good ... Very friendly people and some of the food was good some not ... Restaurant is comfy and nicely setup ... Not sure if I will go there again ... Flatbread was great ... Hummus was good ... Vegetables that came with it were tasteless ... Entree Thai Red Curry bowl is just terrible .. The entire bowl tastes the same ... Like something you can buy pre cooked ... Don't eat that ..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Lyfe kitchen and I was anticipating some good food. I was hungry and ordered the chicken sandwich. I took a few bites and thought it was a little chewy. By the third or fourth bite I found the chicken undercooked. I took the plate up to the counter to discreetly tell them it was undercooked and they offered me something else off of menu but by that time my stomach was churning so I said I didn't want anything else. The worker just said sorry but did not offer to refund or gift card my meal. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to Lyfe Kitchen twice and ordered the exact same thing each time. Because I'm trying to intake less carbs, I order the salmon and the asparagus, no rice or pasta. First time, I got a huge piece of salmon, perfectly cooked, with an aioli on the side. The asparagus was huge, plentiful, and perfectly cooked. My second experience was not quite as enjoyable. Salmon was both smaller and noticeably dry. The asparagus was less charred and more burnt, leaving a really bitter taste in my mouth. After trying one piece I asked them to remake it, and what they brought out wasn't much better. I'm really disappointed by the lack of consistency.

The picture is comparing the asparagus from the first and second visits. The above picture is of the remade dish, not the original one I received."}
{"text":"Ordered all our food off GF menu.  Food was good but not great.  Portions small and pricey, but I guess that is normal for \"healthier\" food.  Kids were still hungry after eating their GF margherita flatbread.  Husband said fish tacos were ok.  My GF Pizzadilla Wich was good and pretty filling.  Would not come back here with the kids.  Like the concept and ambience but too expensive for families.  Good lunch date place."}
{"text":"Awesome service tonight and always! Came in with my best friends and mom and was told they didn't have a specific dish for my friend after ordering. They were able to offer another option, comped lemonade and gelato for dessert. HIGHLY recommend the bbq shrimp tacos! 10/10!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple times. 
The food has always been great. Like the concept there and their healthy meals are worth it. 

Should try the burgers and the flatbreads- they are delicious! 

The only minus I can give is the long waiting time due to the waiting line. Once you ordered you get your order pretty fast. 

I am satisfied and will stay a customer!"}
{"text":"Happy happy happy hour!!!! Mon-Fri 4-6pm.

I've always wanted to try this place out and I finally got to. They have fresh and organic food on their menu. Lots of different choices to pick from. I ended up getting the happy hour margarita flatbread for $5. It's was sooooooo delicious. Hot, crispy, and flavorful! I also got the fresh squeezed lemonade. I wish I got the pomegranate one but I'm going to have to try that next time. 

The service was pretty good. The guy who kept checking up on me was pretty funny. He even gave me a whole cup of lemonade to go. I really enjoyed the ambiance and setting inside. I've read that it gets super busy and I'm glad that when I went there was only a few parties inside. Definitely want to go back and try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today to give it a try. To sum it up: Way overpriced, small portions, super slow service. 

Arrived about 11:00 and it wasn't very busy. We ordered chips & guacamole, fish tacos and the chicken sandwich. It was just under $30 with no drinks.

As other reviews mention you order at a counter like your at a fast food place. We waited and waited for the food. It wasn't busy in there but took way too long for what we ordered. 

 The guacamole was pretty good but the chips were very hard. It was $6.95 for the same size you get at Chipotle for half the cost.

The fish tacos were just one piece of fish on a corn tortilla with some cabbage thrown on top. $9.99. The chicken sandwich was ok and said it came with a side salad. It was a couple pieces of greens with hardly any dressing.  Was not impressed with Lyfe kitchen at all."}
{"text":"When I heard about this place, the emphasis was on how healthy the food is. Sounded good to me...  I arrived to find a bright, well lit, contemporary space...  My thought was that if Apple designed a restaurant, this is what it would look like. 

The menus are hung on the wall to the left as you walk in. Separate menus for Vegan, Gluten Free and Eat Everything...  I'm an \"Eat Everything\" guy...

I was torn between the Fish Tacos and the Chicken and Black Bean Bowl with jalapeños and after consulting the cashier, selected the Chicken Bowl and a \"water\" that had fresh blackberries, strawberries, lemon, mint, etc. 

I expected good, but what I received was really great, bordering on perfection. The chicken was grilled and tender, the black beans were a mix of whole and puréed beans with rich, earthy and full flavored, almost like a soup. Fresh, ripe avocado, jalapeños, peppers and onion were well integrated and beautifully balanced with just the right amount of spice. Just the right amount of grated cheddar finished this beautiful dish off. 

Simply said, this is the best lunch that I've had at anywhere near this price and with my total bill at $15...  Wow. 

I can't wait to come back..."}
{"text":"Didn't care for it. The black bean burger was dry. The cashew curry rice noodles were very sour. First time there. Won't be back. Two stars for my daughter who liked her burger."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite spot! I love that a lot of their ingredients are organic and I also like that they have a carbonated water fountain over there that you can choose to get or the filtered water. One of my favorite things is that they have this tall tower that they grow fresh herbs in look so fresh! 
My favorite thing to order there is there salad so amazing! I love to add salmon and grilled shrimp to that. All the toppings and ingredients they add to the salad makes it over the top and the dressing is quite tasty too. I also enjoy their desserts that they have especially the chocolate mousse! It even has a chocolate chip cookie on top yummy yummy!
Not to mention they have some pretty tasty fruit drinks there. Their tacos were not bad. Customer service is alright. The seatings are plentiful, the place is open and bright. They even have a point system where you receive points and get free food items like appetizers desserts or tacos. Which I enjoy that they do that because I come so often."}
{"text":"I had read and heard many mixed reviews about Lyfe Kitchen, but I came to try them for myself.

The restaurant is modern and clean. I enjoy the entire concept of this restaurant. Healthy food, that is inventive, yet still tasty.

My friends and I were able to sample a good amount of items and enjoyed just about everything we ordered. 

The food was fresh and I, for one, found everything to be delicious and that was the consensus around the table. They were able to maintain the health benefits and low calorie integrity of all the food without sacrificing flavor, which I was impressed by. My friend raved about the buffalo chicken, and even put in a second order because it was so good.

My chia and cucumber drink was really great and I look forward to coming back and trying the assortment of all the different smoothies and drinks they have available.

They have several menus catering to different dietary needs and programs, which is helpful. I look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!!!!! Patio seating, vegan options, gluten free options, and reasonably priced. Gardein products are amazing!! Can't even taste the difference! Tried the Gardein chicken wings....awesome!! And the buffalo Gardein chicken wrap......even more awesome! So excited to go back and try more!!"}
{"text":"I call this type of food \"LA food\" - healthyish, with gluten-free / vegan / organic / whatever items available on the menu. I might still end up ordering something fried in trans fats, but I love the idea of having the option of something allegedly healthy. Nothing is healthier than making a dressing-free salad at home, but sometimes life gets crazy. 

In any case, I came here around 10.30 after having some maintenance done over at Sola Salons. I ordered the fish tacos for takeaway to have as lunch later. After I waited for a few minutes, the cashier / hostess told me she had totally spaced and that they weren't serving lunch yet. They were making my tacos, but it would just be a few extra minutes. I appreciate that they made them anyway, instead of asking me to order something else.

TBH, I ate the tacos right before an exam and I stress blackout, so I can't really remember much about them, but I'm sure they were good. Service was fast and friendly, the place was clean and bright, and I'm assuming for now the food was good. 

My guy friends tend to have a \"where's the beef?\" and \"what? it's so small\" experience  when they come here, but for a small eater like me, portions are perfectly .. proportioned."}
{"text":"Delicious food, the service is fast, but is not fast food, it's very tasty and they have a healthy menu, from vegan to fish and chicken.
I have been there twice so far and ordered different things each, so far my experience is good and I will definitely will continue going"}
