{"text":"On another business trip to Calgary I got to stay in the international hotel.  The 4th Avenue Cafe is located in the hotel basement.  It features some wall sized photos of Calgary in the 1950s and clean contemporary seating.

Walking in, I was greeted by the maitre'd who bore a striking resemblance to Oddjob from the movie Goldfinger.  He also serves all of the OJ and coffee.

Having eaten there for four breakfasts I had:
- Western Scramble - scrambled eggs with a bunch of good stuff and smothered in cheese yummy!
- Johnny cakes - pancakes served with cream and berries except my crime never showed up
- Regular French Toast the best meal that I had there
- Eggs Benedict - pretty good

Overall it was a decent restaurant.  I was ok with the food!  The pluses were the convenient location and the friendly staff."}

{"text":"I tried out the 4th Avenue Cafe @ the International Hotel during The Big Taste.  There was 3 course fixe-prixe menu only during The Big Taste event.  The menu was prepared with a South-East Asian flair.  Reminds me of home....

First course was Lobster Bisque - delicious and smooth.

Second course was a choice of Chicken Wings in a fish sacue or Papaya Salad with Panko Crusted Prawns - I chose the Papaya Salad - Quite a light lunch with a nicely tossed salad of grated carrots, cilantro, grated jicama, grated cucumbers in a nice sweet vinagrette with lots of crunchy chunky peanuts.  Found the peanuts a little too chunky.  The prawns were nicely done.  My friend had the chicken wings and it was battered with a sesame oil and fish sace poured on top of the wings so it's a little sticky.  Also good!

Third course - Mango Cake with a dollop of Taro (Ube) icecream and a Pandan Cigar.  The Pandan Cigar is a little roll-up of wafer made with pandan or the essence of screwpine leaves.  That brought me back to home...

Other than The Big Taste event, I could see other people eating from the Cafe's Menu and it had a lot of variety like burgers and fries, sandwiches, soups, stir-fry on rice."}
{"text":"Free breakfast! It was just OK. Good enough to get us going for the day. If we had to pay, we would not have eaten here.
The beverages were self serve. This place is geared for the business traveler who wants to get up and go. There were ipads along the walls to get news and what not.
The kids thought the pancake machine was cool, but not very tasty."}
{"text":"This is a great hotel restaurant.  The food is simple and fresh.  The beef dip is the best in Calgary!  Ever since the flood they have renovated and it looks great."}
