{"text":"Ok...so I'm from NY and took a last minute two night trip to Montreal with my 8 year old son. After a long afternoon of swimming, my son was hungry. He had taken a shower and put on his pajamas and basically said we needed to get something delivered. I searched Yelp for easily 30 minutes reading through reviews and finding a place that was open on a Sunday night in January. Came across Zestos pizza - mixed reviews - but didn't care because my son is 8 he wanted pizza and he was cranky - and they delivered....FOR FREE to my hotel. So i called them up and this guy answered and he was so ridiculously nice - I mean - I'm not used to that - coming from NY and all. He was nice and helpful with the menu, didn't rush me or anything - I kind of wished I had gone in just so I could show him the smile he put on my face! 

Ordered a small 10\" pie, garlic bread (with mozz.) and onion rings (per my son's request) and of course poutine because I can't leave without trying it. Aside from the fact that this was a ridiculous amount of food and we didn't even eat half of  it- the delivery was quick and the woman who delivered was equally as friendly as the guy who took the order! All these nice people! I don't want to leave! 

The pizza was really good...it's nothing compared to NY pizza but it comes in at a close second. I loved the crust - it was earthy and cooked perfectly. The pizza had a slight hint of rosemary and I liked that very much. The food was still hot when it arrived and came with everything we would need (plates, utensils, condiments, etc.) Their servings are quite generous so avoid over ordering as I did because now we're just going to have food to reheat over the next day or two when we're back home. Overall, I would recommend this place hands down. Prices were good, food was good and the service was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I was visiting town, and after reading YELP, decided that this could be a good idea. I was wrong. The pizza showed up cold, with little sauce, and hardly any topings. I paid for spinach to be added to my pizza and saw 4 pieces of spinach on the whole pizza. I could also count the pieces of pineapple on my hawaiian pizza. It was disappointing beyond belief, both for the price, and considering what I read here."}
{"text":"Just got my pie...ordered a Spicy Mexican pizza, which included hot peppers, ground beef onions and cheese. No hot peppers to be found. Nothing Mexican about this. Crust a bit overcooked, but overall not a bad pie, just not what was advertised.

On the plus side, the order was promised in 30 mins, and they delivered on that."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for delivery pizza kind of food at about 9:30PM while staying that the Marriot Chateau Champlain and found Zestos here on yelp. The woman who took our order was very abrupt, but it's Thanksgiving weekend so they might be really busy.

The delivery was surprisingly fast. My wife just got onion soup and some apple pie and I ordered Sous-Marin Deluxe (steak and cheese sub with onions, peppers, pepperoni, mushrooms, and melted cheese). She thought her food was decent while I was underwhelmed. The order may have been mixed up since my sub was missing pepperoni and mushrooms but had lettuce and tomatoes. It was cooked well, but we found the food a little more greasy than we were expecting.

Overall they completely met the need we had, the food arrived very fast, and it was good quality. The mistake could be related to the speed at which the order was taken or a slight language slip."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken poutine for delivery and was very good.  They forgot the cutlery and got my drinks mixed up however they did come back and correct the mistake. Kudos for service!"}
{"text":"Quand je n'ai pas envie de cuisiner et que je décide de me laisser aller à un plaisir coupable, je commande une pizza chez Zestos. Et ce, depuis vingt ans. Une pizza égale à elle-même, sans mauvaise surprise. Les glucides et les calories sont toujours au rendez-vous. La pizza de chez Zestos est excellente, mais de grâce, n'en parlez pas à mon médecin !"}
{"text":"Good for late night junk food delivery.  Salad's pretty decent, too."}
{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni pizza to be delivered to our hotel room.  It came quickly.  Cost was around $20 Canadian.  It was hot and good even if a little bland.  The ingredients were fresh and if I am not mistaken the cheese was whole milk mozzarella."}
{"text":"Damn good pizza at 2am. 

The Hotel Omni advertises for them, so I tried them out from inside my hotel room, to which they delivered late late at night. It was very good pizza... awesome cheese, slightly bland sauce, awesome crust. The pepperoni mushroom pepper combo was a good deal too. Thanks Zestos."}
{"text":"Great pizza after a long day of traveling. Delivery service was not the fastest, but totally worth the wait. I loved the crisp crust."}
