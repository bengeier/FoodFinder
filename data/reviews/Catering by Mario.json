{"text":"Had the baked ziti and salad with berries.  Came with a basket of bread and butter. Sopped up the extra sauce with the soft Italian bread.  Everything was delicious including the raspberry sorbet. Nice friendly service too."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've wanted to write a review even before my food arrived. Why? This place gets full points for its interiors. An oversized dresser at the entrance gives it a homely feel. Its got a cosy,European cafe vibe,plenty of light and a spiral staircase for upstairs seating as well. Nestled amidst a boring stretch of office buildings,I would have never known of this place if not for someone reccomending it. I got the Italian sausage sandwich which came with a side salad. It was so yum, just like nonna would make it. They also offer catering so I've already got them bookmarked! Definite must try place."}
{"text":"Little hidden gem in the midst of an industrial/office area. 

This place is pretty good.

The good - their sandwiches are delicious. Bread to meat proportions are perfect. We got takeout here. The best part is that you can order online and pay at the restaurant instead of calling to pre order. 

The bad - we ordered online and order was punched in correct, however the toppings that were requested weren't there. 

Despite the lack of toppings on my sandwich, it still tasted good, but could've been even better.

I'd give them another shot.

If you pay in cash, you'll get a discount."}

The event went well, and he took care of everything and all his staff and food went according to plan. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Nestled in the office wasteland of Hwy 7 and Leslie lies an incredible Italian place that I kind of want to keep to myself. There you will find incredible food and friendly folks.

My coworker brought me here for some much needed chicken parmesan therapy. Their chicken parm is served on a crusty bun and is jam packed with flavour. It has easily pushed California Sandwiches out of the number 1 spot for me. The sandwich here has less meat, but the meat is way more flavourful and fulfilling. 

Service is friendly and well paced. They seem to only serve regulars, as they seemed to be on a first name basis with everyone that came in (we were sitting at the counter). There is also a small, sunny dining room for those who don't want to do take out.

This place is a menace to my health. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My friend works around the area and used to get take-out here.  Highly recommended by her and so here I am : )
Nice cozy place and it was packed during lunch.  We sat at the bar and Mario was there.  He introduced us to his wife and his two sons.  It's sure a family business : )
We ordered Tuscan bean soup, Caesar salad and Gomitelli al Forno.  Mario gave us extra bread and taught us an Italian word \" scarpetta\", which means, mop up the sauce of the plate with the bread.  We did scarpetta our plate : )   It was as clean as it has just finished a hot bath in a dish washer :p
We ended our meal with velvet cake and coffee.  Yummmm

** Forgot the pix coz too busy in \"scarpetta\"  and chit chat with Mario.  Will sure make it up another time! **
** Mario told us he teaches.  We can form our group and go there to learn how to cook great Italian food. **
** This place is located in a commercial complex.  Easy to miss! **
^^ Great food with reasonable price.  $40 for two ^^
@@ They serve lunch only. Monday to Friday @@"}
{"text":"I agree, Mario's Paninoteca or Catering By Mario's deserves 10 stars.  I passed by this place for a few years and then had a disappointing meatball sandwich elsewhere and thought I might get a better one here. Boy, was I right. I ate lunch there for literally every day for the next year. Sandwiches, pastas, salads, soups, specials: they are all fresh and delicious.

I like family run businesses and this one should win a \"Food Oscar\". Service is impeccable, and they treat everyone like they are part of Mario's family. This is not a chain and not chain-restaurant food.

They are happy to customise any dish and want their customers to be happy and return. And boy, do they return.  Lunch time is full of regulars. I often refer to it as the \"Italian Cheers\".

On Thursdays, they serve an upscale special lunch, which are so amazing, I get a couple to take home for dinner.

Try it for yourself. You will be glad you did!!!! Buon Appetito."}
{"text":"Dropped by here once when I was looking for some good Italian by my work place. I am not a fan of the Alice Fazooli's etc. I find most restaurants make terrible Italian so I ventured into the industrial mall to find good Italian. It was a quite interesting setup upon my first venture, they have kept it to an Italian influenced d√©cor and have a second floor. I arrived  a bit before lunch and was able to get my order quickly. The place filled up very quickly. It is quite popular. Food passed my standards. Staff was quite friendly. I will be back!"}
