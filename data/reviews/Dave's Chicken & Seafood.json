{"text":"This place is gone now and it seems like good riddance...bye bye greasy chicken. Apparently this \"review\" is too short. This place is now a cheque cashing loan place or will be very soon, just what the neighbourhood needed. To sum up no more Dave's Chicken, it is not there anymore.  Thank you

P.S. Dave's Chicken has closed. Thank you"}
{"text":"Hopefully this will be considered a fair review.  Some recent Yelpers have been using the Scarlett Road location entry to review other Dave's locations and this isn't fair.  It is my experience that not all Dave's are equal.

I was motivated to review the Scarlett Road location after reading poor reviews.  I have eaten at the Westdale Mall location twice and both times it was a good experience.  

Today, I visited the Scarlett Road location.  It is a rather small establishment and appeared quite clean.  I ordered a 3-piece combo with a combination of mild and spicy chicken, mashed pototoes, coleslaw, biscuit and soft drink.  At just over $9 including tax, this represents the best value (considering two side dishes AND biscuit) of any fried chicken quick-service restaurant.  The mild piece of chicken was rather bland and after eating it, I was relieved that the balance of my meal was \"spicy\".  Nevertheless, it was well cooked with good texture.  The spicy pieces were darker in colour with a more intense spice blend of sage and perhaps, paprika, rather than cayenne to give it some heat.  It was okay but somewhat more oily than average on the underside as it sat in the paper basket awaiting consumption.  The mashed potato portion was small, but rather tasty as well as a welcome non-fried alternative to fries.  The coleslaw was standard and the biscuit was fluffy - similar to Popeyes.  Unfortunately, the service, although fairly fast, wasn't particularly friendly.  The woman who served me seemed to be a position of some authority but I barely got a \"hello\" and certainly no \"thank you\" when the transaction was complete.  As a new business aspiring for repeat business, this is unfortunate.

Overall, if dining alone, this restaurant represents good value.  Stick with spicy chicken and perhaps use a napkin to blot out excess oil from individual pieces.  For a superior Dave's experience, try the Mississauga location at Westdale Mall.  Service is more friendly and the chicken seemed tastier and less greasy."}
{"text":"Came here because it seems that all chicken places around are closing

Terrible gravy, chicken skin, coleslaw, and worst of all it took them 30 mins to make it

Wish we could rate fractions of stars like 0.1"}
{"text":"Came here while waiting for my dog to get groomed down the street; hence why I had to eat in the restaurant. It's really small... Only three tables. As I looked at the menu I couldn't help but think it mirrors a more costly version of Popeyes. I ordered the fish and chips; it came to around fifteen bucks for the combo. I got two very bland pieces of fish, a small amount of fries, a well done biscuit and a small drink. 

This was the first and last time I'm ever eating at a Dave's. For this price I could have got an actual meal that I enjoyed. Including a small size drink with a combo that big is just penny pinching. The coleslaw was literally scooped from the ziggys coleslaw at the grocery store. The batter had zero seasoning and when I asked for a lemon, he brought out an end piece wrapped in Saran Wrap from the back. These people are nice to speak to but their prices don't reflect their food quality or their proportions. Let me stick to ordering real fish and chips for the same price."}
{"text":"its sucks place really so bad food and customer service  i never thought theres placed like daves chicken im wondering how those people they can run a store as well as the chicken with tons of oil"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times and always get a hello from the lady on cash and she is always smiling and as well the young ladies cooking pop there head through the window and say hello ... Now a few times I have ordered the 2 piece meal and was able to make some changes to the meat and they have never had a prob with it and the chicken is always so good and fresh.. Other times I ordered the fish sandwich and poutine and was also awesome and worth the money.... I think this is a great place to eat"}
{"text":"Yuck!! We ordered delivery a week ago! I really wanted this place to be my new fried chicken place since it's in the neighbourhood, but all I got was gravy that was thinner than soup, chicken that had no flavour other than salt, and lots of salt! And the Mac salad wasn't even homemade! Take  out menu was put in garbage so I can forget this whole ordeal!"}
