{"text":"Worst service ever! Went here a few weeks ago about an hour and a halfway before they closed and got treated horribly ! I asked if we could get an appetizer and our writer replies with \"we'll what do you want? The kitchens closing soon\" we got up and left right then. Also had a hair in my water. Never coming here again !!"}
{"text":"The customer service is crap but I don't even care because the food is so delicious.  I drive past 6 other Chinese food places and cross 3 cities to go here instead of what's closer."}
{"text":"Great for deliveries. 
If you are looking for fresh, good quality Chinese food for delivery, this is your place. Customer service in the restaurant isn't great, but the the quality of the food is top notch. We love the shrimp fried rice and the orange chicken is all white meat (we get it every time)."}
{"text":"I've been going to Grand China ever since I moved to Mayfield my sophomore year of high school. Though I don't live close there now, I'd still make the drive to get their food.
The woman knows me so well she knows what I want the second I step in the door.
The sesame chicken combination! She says.
Damn straight.
I love their rice as well, and a chinese place needs to have good rice. 
Overall, its not just one of those shoddy backlit sign places. Its not redundant.
It has character, and so do the people working there.
Give it a try, and give them some well deserved business."}
{"text":"Can't say enough how much we love this place AND more importantly the people. Every time we come the food and the service is amazing. I love the General Tso Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, Lemon Chicken (although I make it spicy once it gets to the table), String Bean Beef. My husband loves Mandarin Garlic Chicken, Tomato Beef, Kung Pao Chicken, Pepper Steak, Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Pork. Honestly there isn't anything we've tried we haven't liked."}
{"text":"I have ordered both take out and dined in, never any issues and always yummy! Cream cheese wontons"}
{"text":"Not very good. I wouldn't go back because nothing really tasted that good. Dishes lacked flavor and spice.  My shrimp tasted like dirt- which is kinda scary a a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't hold my chinese food to a high standard, but I tend to  judge it exclusively on the quality of the crab rangoon. I had high hopes that this might be my Las Vegas chinese take out restaurant, sadly, I was extremely disappointed. There was barely any filling in the crab rangoon, and what I had left was deep fried crunchy puffs. No cream cheese. No crab. It ruined my dinner. 

I might be forgiving if the General Tso's chicken was yummy, saucy, guilty pleasure goodness, but it kind of reminded me of the the frozen General Tso's chicken you can buy at the grocery store and bake in your oven. 

As a final bonus disappointment, they do not have brown rice as an option. 

I will continue to search for my local chinese go to spot."}
{"text":"The sweet chinese lady with the thich accent is always friendly. 

Today, we got honey walnut shrimp. For some reason I thought it was too oily and I didn't eat much of it. Egg drop soup is always good. I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Henderson and they suggested we meet here.  Our large party of 13 was seated quickly.  We all ordered for our families and theyn were happy to seperate our checks for us.  Although, we ask that after ordering and that ws super confusing for the waitress.  After getting the orders straigtened out we enjoyed our soup and appetizers.  Our meals were served quickly but not all at the same time.  One person in our party waited for 15 minutes for here meal.  THe food was fresh and served hot.  Everyone was pleased with their choices and left very full.  The prices were very reasonable.  I WOULD RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"I love this place for casual Chinese food. We usually order lunch menu for to-go and nothing really disappoints me. They all taste good. However, their service is terrible. Everytime I visit here, a very unfriendly male waiter in his 50's takes my order. I was very unhappy when he didn't come to take my order for more than 5 minutes even the restaurant had only two customers."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the valley,friendly fast service, amazing atmosphere. Go here you will enjoy it immensely."}
{"text":"Ordered a large shrimp fried rice for about $8 and got a container full of rice any MAYBE 10 pieces of ship . Ordered a SMALL ORANGE CHICKEN and she charges me $7, it came in a tiny white styrofoam  container , it was enough for THREE BITES . I asked her where is that price on the menu, she said the small wasn't on the menu ... So you are making up prices as you go along?? Also large paper steak for $10 got a container full of green pepper and onions , maybe 5 pieces of steak . So disappointed . Called back she said \"next time we will put more\" no . I'm not ever coming back . ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place and have been several times! Everything comes out quick weather it is to go or dine in. The same woman is always waiting tables and seems to usually be the only one doing so, still she is prompt and polite! The menu is rather large and includes combination dinners that come with soup, an entree, an egg roll, and a crab Rangoon for 8.95 or 9.95! The food is what you would expect from an Americanized Chinese restaurant but everything is always tasty and hot. I am sure we will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Ok I see there are ratings of 5 stars, must have been from the employees family,,I was surprised at the service & the food. It was Saturday night 6:30 and the place was empty, should have been the first clue, the one man seats us, brings our drink order and takes our dinner order, Mongolian beef for my companion and Cashew Shrinp for me, Soup, egg roll & Crab rangoon ok but meal comes,,,,,Shrimp with nuts,he said as he set it down,,,,peanuts are not cashews! My companions beef was good he told me but my plate was tasteless if not dissappointing. I WILL NOT GO AGAIN, very unhappy with this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not one for negative reviews, but this place was underwhelming. First off I have to give props to the lady at the front... She is the only reason they get 2 stars. The food tasted like stale water and chemicals... All of it... The black pepper steak was \"ok\" at best... Several pieces of \"orange chicken\" didn't have chicken in them. I could continue but it was a waste of $50 and time cause now we have to find dinner again... Don't go!"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome for delivery, fast and good prices!

The spicy dishes have just the right amount of heat.  Kung pao is always good.  Nice to have a family business nearby."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!!!!! When I called; the lady taking orders asked me my telephone number 4 times, then when she asked what was my order I proceeded to order she began to talk over and offer items on the menu that I never even mentioned, then she asked me for my address 6 times. It took over an hour for the food to get here (which should have only been a 6 min drive), then as soon as the food got to me the deliverer man gave me the receipt and immediately began to tell me I giving him a tip? I didn't even get to pay for the food; and this jerk is telling me I'm going to give him a tip, who the hell does that???  When the lady over the phone gave me my total she told me my total was $32.80, however when the deliverer guy gave me the receipt I saw they ran my card for $43.54? I asked him why they ran my card for $10 more than my total he told me to call and he had nothing to do with that. I called in pissed and this time there was a man who answered, he pretended not to speak English and then had the nerve to hang up the phone on me (of course this want be the end of that). And to get to the food part.....the food was very greasy and had no flavor to it period, the shrimp egg foo young had absolutely no shrimp in it? I also asked the lady who took my order to please make sure there was sweet and sour sauce in the bag, of course there was no sweet and sour sauce. And not to mention one of the items was not what I ordered. Please do not ever eat here!! The service is horrible, the food is horrible, and you will get totally ripped off!"}
{"text":"This was our 1st time ordering from Grand China. We ordered online so there was no reason for the order to be wrong but it was. It also took 1 and 1/4 hours for delivery. When I called to get updates on delivery I could not understand the woman on the phone-very poor English. The good news was that their shrimp rolls and won ton soup were good."}
{"text":"This place is a a joke. Picture of lemon fish shows a fish, what you get are pieces of fish deep fried.  Singapore noodles is said to be spicy, it was just bland. No spice at all. Fried rice was steamed rice with catsup added and a couple of peas put on top. And I mean a couple, 2!

Oh yeah!! The lemon sauce they give you for the fish is basically lemon colored sugar. 

I ordered delivery. Spent $50 plus tip and it was a waste of good money. Should have got a pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Both times the food was delicious.  We ordered Moo Goo Gai Pan, and Mandarin Chicken.  The Moo Goo sauce was flavorful and the vegetables tasty.  The Mandarin Chicken was perfect.   Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside with just the right amount of sweetness in the sauce.  Careful when you order the egg drop soup.  A bowl will feed 4 people.  The waitress did try to warn me.  It was delicous though. Pork fried rice has just those little bits of sweet/savory pork that I find so essential in fried rice.  So many places nowadays just put a litlle eggs and onions in the fried rice. Theirs was full of the good stuff.  Very friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Just brought home some shrimp egg foo young, pork fried rice and wonton soup. Spent $28. WORST CHINESE FOOD I'VE EVER HAD !!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm originally from New York so I know what chinese food is supposed to tase like. This was horrible !!!!!"}
{"text":"I went in expecting a four star restaurant but i was sorely disappointed. The food while properly cooked and seemed appetizing but was bland and they seemingly did not understand how to make our food spicy and they did not have a spicy sauce to add of the top. 

However the Mandarin gourmet garlic was a delight. The garlic sauce atop the chicken was very tasty though the chicken was a little dry. I would get something with the garlic sauce because that seemed to be the only item with lots of flavor. Also the service was very slow because there was only one server for the entire restaurant so be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"The FOOD is good.  The rest of my experience was mainly disappointing.  Ordered four entrées and one was incorrect.  Their online menu does not match what they offer.  WIth four entrées delivered only included one container of rice and two fortune cookies with $40 order.  HOW CHEAP!  I was also overcharged about $7 and was not given a receipt with the order.  I attempted to give them one more try and also explain the previous problems and was told that they don't have a manager and the lady on the phone would not listen to what I was saying.  She was only interested in interrupting and talking over me.  They have lost a good customer that like their food."}
{"text":"I searched for a good Chinese restaurant & on goggle this place had 3.8 stars & some comments about rudeness & greasy food.  We had a party of 7 and we did not experience anything like that.  The waitress was very nice and accommodating.  She even charged my cell phone!  2 of us got a combo plate which for $10 had appetizers, soup, and entrée.  The rest of us ordered meals:  Lemon Pork, Shrimp Chow Mein, Walnut Shrimp, Fried Rice, Chicken and Vegetables.  The food was good and plentiful.  And it averaged $13/person so very reasonable.  The waitress made sure that our beverages were kept full and she kept asking if everything was okay. Extremely positive experience with the food, the atmosphere, and the service.  When I'm back in the area I will certainly go again!"}
{"text":"I ordered items to be delivered. Placed my order at 6:40.. was quoted 45 mins. At 7:40pm after being bugged by my son I called and was told the driver left already with my order - which was already an hour past when I ordered.. 8pm rolled around still no food.. needless to say 8:20pm I got my food. After making 3 phone calls inquiring about the delivery. As angry as I am about the service .. the food is great! We had Kung pow chicken, beef broccoli, white rice & chicken chow mein & everything was delicious. For my troubles I was offered 20% off my next bill but honestly.. have no plans ordering delivery from there again if the wait is almost 2 hours."}
{"text":"No flavor. Does not even taste like Chinese food. The sauce has loads of sugar. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Now, let me say the veggie egg foo  young was AWESOME! The veggie mu shu was great, but I think I saw a chicken piece in it. Shrimp fried rice was great. Now to the part as to why 3 stars if the food ordered was so good: Honesty. I ordered some \"Crab Rangoon wontons\".  This is when crab and cream cheese are placed inside Wonton wrap and fried up. The first bite, I knew it was not crab. Sure enough, they used that imitation meat.They did not taste good,because they did not utilize the right product....real crab. $10 literally in the trash.  They should disclose \"made with imitation crab meat. Honesty is the best policy"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place has a monopoly on Chinese food take-out in this area....There used to be a few others around but this place has actually swooped up all of their phone numbers as well..so be careful about where you think you are calling. I called to order from the chinese place in Golden Gate and apparently the call got redirected to here. Was a bit of a surprise..the other place had closed. 
ANYWAY, the food is meh...nothing special. Even though I called in my order ahead of time, I still waited for a while in the gross lobby. Also watched the \"cooks\" microwave several large slabs of raw beef...that was interesting. Lastly, I'm not trying to be mean but the woman who answers the phone is literally incomprehensible. She got out order completely wrong and never asks for a name or phone number...I could not understand a word she was saying...and I'm pretty well versed in accents (science community). I will not say I won't order from here again because out of desperation, I probably will...but it really isn't very good."}
{"text":"Orange beef was very dry and wasn't fresh at all. Kids meal sweet and sour chicken was tasteless. Shrimp in lobster sauce was good though, but not enough to overcome the bad. They were also out of most Of the beer choices when we were there."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I come here every time I am in town. I always receive excellent service and great food!"}
{"text":"You want something that will make you feel better when you are down and out with a \"cold\"? Their WonTon soup! I get it every time someone in the house isn't feeling well. My kids even ask for it when they are sick. Try it!"}
{"text":"This place has hidden gems on the menu! The only problem is that you have to sift through 5 pages of mediocre food to find them! My friends and I got 5 items : Pot Stickers, Beef & Broccoli, House Fried Rice, Pulled Pork Peking, and General Tso's,

Pot Stickers: Good. These have been the best pot stickers I've had in LV so far. They were well cooked, not at all greasy, and the sauce was good. But still no where near the best I've had. 
         P.S. Can we please stop serving pot stickers on a bed of shredded lettuce! It's not fancy... it's sad!!!

Beef & Broccoli: Average. But what made it average was the beef! The sauce was great, which made the broccoli great! However the beef had a weird flavor that none of us liked.

House Fried Rice: Average. This is another one of my \"it is what it is\" moments. Its fried rice, not great, not bad, just fried rice.

Pulled Pork Peking: Good... I think. This one is odd... but good... but odd... but good... but still odd. First of all, It's not PULLED pork. It's chunks of pork, which isn't bad, just not what was expected. Regardless, the dish had great flavor, but in my opinion, and my friend's as well, the dish was overly sweet. I would however order this again... I think...

General Tso's Chicken: Great!! Ah, the pièce de résistance! The diamond in the rough! This was by far the BEST general tso's chicken, actually the best Chinese food item period, that I've had in LV! One of but not the best general tso's I've had anywhere! This item will hands down guarantee my return business! 

Oh, I almost forgot! The white rice was dry, just like every other Chinese place out here (I've yet to understand why) and the service was ok."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food is where this is going to take you! Love the service and the selection! It is a low price spot to make it worth your life!"}
{"text":"I love this place-it's my go to for take out, especially after a long day of work and I don't feel like cooking. We've been coming here for years and the quality has remained consistent. The ladies who work there are also the sweetest after-they always ask about my family and work and it's just a really comfortable experience!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese in Henderson.  The chicken curry is my favorite dish.  I crave the stuff.  It is also hard to pass up the salt and pepper wings.  Every dish is just as good as the last and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the GC for the past two years.  Never a bad experience.  Once they see you a few times the staff seems excited to see you.

Once they ran out of cream for my thai tea.  They actually left the restaurant went across the parking lot and picked some up at the grocery store.

Lot's of items to choose from on the menu served hot and fresh."}
{"text":"They're only getting two stars only because the servers were very friendly and very attentive with continuously filling water glasses etc. but I was very disappointed in this restaurant because the name caught my eye and we were very hungry for Chinese food and wanted to try this place out. It seems as though there is just no good Chinese food in this area like they have in the Northeastern United States. But anyway please don't order the chicken teriyaki bowl because it tastes nothing-- and I mean NOTHING-- like teriyaki at all whatsoever. It tasted like soggy egg-batter nasty luke-warm chicken. For an appetizer we ordered the Pu Pu platter and it was like microwaved frozen dinner Leanne Wu type stuff you would find at the frozen foods section at any supermarket. The shrimp was very soggy and like it was totally microwaved ... So horrible and disappointing...and the  \"egg rolls\" were SO NOT not egg rolls,  more like microwaved spring rolls with hardly any filling; basically just like what you'd buy in big bags at Costco. Just a waste of money, so disappointing--but I do hear that the lunch specials are really good (according to the Yelp reviews) so if I ever decide to ever try it again it will definitely be around lunch and definitely not dinner time. Plus it was dead, one other table, they didn't look too pleased either. Just a sad experience. I would have given 1 star but since the server was friendly... you get the idea. If I ever go for lunch I will post a review to let you know how the experience was but for now don't even waste your time because it's not like the American Chinese food you get other parts of the country. Just gross, soggy, bland tasteless nasty food."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, great food, good location.

They pack everything well, especially if you end up ordering a family dinner.

I did have to remove one star for the crab rangoons. They are much too sweet. Sweetest I've ever had. They were like an over-sweet dessert.

Everything else was amazing. I especially enjoyed the sweet and sour pork."}
{"text":"Love the chinese food here.  Very tasty and have great lunch specials.  There are chinese restaurants closer to us, but I always drive to this one because it is so good."}
{"text":"At first, I was really skeptical of a place serving BOTH Chinese food AND Vietnamese food and located in the far southwest part of town.  My boyfriend kindly reminded me that I am a product of a family of two cultures (Chinese and Vietnamese), too, and bomb pho definitely exists at home... ok ok, back to the review of the FOOD.

In we went, and this review is only based off of the few Vietnamese items that we tried.
1.  Pho Tai - Slices of beef noodle soup.  Not too bad but could also be better.  Broth had a nice beefy flavor base.  The plate of greens on the side looked fresh but amount was not impressive.  I can understand that because being on this side of town, you wouldn't expect the crowd to want a load of greens anyway.
2.  Com Thit Nuong - Charbroiled thinly sliced marinated pork and rice. Visually, the pork was nicely charred but upon chewing it, I realized it was wayyy dry.  A healthy dunk of the nouc cham/fish sauce on the side fixed that.  
3.  Cafe Sua Da - Vietnamese iced coffee.  This tasted quite strange to me.  It had the flavor essence of some sort of coffee liqueur.  Very weird.

Conclusion:  I think that if you are stuck on the southwest side of town with no time to make it to Chinatown area for better Vietnamese pho, Grand China can get you by.  

I think I need to go back another time to see how the Ameri-nese Cuisine (Americanized Chinese Food) is.  Will report back once that happens

p.s. Our server was very nice and efficient during our Monday lunch time adventure.  Poor girl had to work the front, back, take orders and bus the tables, so I'd definitely cut her some slack.  However, her fellow co-worker (a.k.a homeboy with the asian popstar hair and get up) needed to step up a little more help the chick out."}
{"text":"Great prices. We come here often and also get delivery. There's usually only one person working which can be a hassle if you're in a hurry but I don't mind. They give great service and pay extra attention to my kids and get us in and out fed and happy. Portion sizes are generous and I always leave with leftovers."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place wouldn't be good, but much to my dismay the orange chicken was surprisingly tasty (the portions are minuscule, though).  That's too bad, because this place is all the way across town for me, and now I feel compelled to return.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Great spot. The service is fast. If you're looking for a quick Chinese takeout,  this place is the way to go."}
{"text":"Did take-out. Ordered shrimp fried rice. Reasonable portion for the price. Tasted ok. Nothing stellar, but not bad. Similar in taste to the frozen product sold at the nearby Von's. The service staff was polite and efficient."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The meal plan is always good...they make it extra spicy for me and I love it.  The wonton soup is some of the best I have EVER had and the food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars if just for the food. Delicious! Especially for the sweet and sour chicken. 
Waitress was hard to understand and couldn't understand what I wanted and that I was okay with paying $2 more for fried rice. If I wasn't okay, I would have not agreed on it. She should just worry about the food and not trying to save me money. It ended up being a 5 minute semi argument over the 2 dollars.
Aside from the service, every meal is amazing and large portions."}
{"text":"Good food...nice staff they customized the soup,  spring rolls and chow mein was good"}
{"text":"Their stuffs pretty good :) removed one star though because they decreased the amount wings they have per order and upped the price a bit. I was utterly upset. The salt and pepper chicken wings are to die for though. They're huge!"}
{"text":"Tasty food with good price! 

Pros:
- Open at 10:00 AM (we need to catch a flight and this is one close enough to the airport (15 Min. drive) and open early
- Tasty food
- Good price
- easy parking

Cons:
- Some vegetabel are not as fresh as they should be"}
{"text":"Lived in Henderson since 87' and tried lots of Chinese Restaurants. This is the BEST?Great value, prompt service, .
So it's been a year since I discovered Grand China .
I'm sorry to say someone is skimping on Spring Roll filling. Sauces seem watered down. 
I hope things change for the better."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp and so glad I did. It's a nice change of pace from all the regular fast food that populates areas. It is easy to locate, easy access, and not too far from my office. 

The staff is very friendly and attentive while providing great and efficient service. I like their lunch special combo menu. Portion sizes are great and match the price well.

The egg drop soup has always been good, with consistent flavors. The lunch specials come with your entree, fried rice, soup,an egg roll and a soda. I'm always full when I leave and sometimes even have leftovers."}
{"text":"I have tried them a few times and always good I usually get the shrimp egg foo young and egg rolls it's really hard to find good Chinese food there a million different places but I've finally found one that I like in this area"}
{"text":"Been here about three times and order delivery a few times, never been disappointed the food has always been hot and an abundance we can always make a few meals out of one dinner when we get the family meal. Their food is always good and they do not use MSG which I am allergic to"}
{"text":"Having just read Christine's review I thought that I'd throw in my two cents.  My wife and I like the food at Grand China very much and we go there about once every two weeks.  However, it is true that the restaurant is often sparsely populated.  I suspect that this is due to three things.  First, it looks like their business is in large part carry-out and delivery.  Second, there are a number of other Chinese restaurants up and down Rainbow; so the competition must be pretty fierce.  Finally, the current rough economic situation may be playing a part as well.  Christine indicated that the waiter did not seem particularly happy to see her party.  However, that has not been my experience there.  It is true, though, that Chinese folks are not known for being demonstrably affectionate.  Perhaps Christine's experience might have arisen from a cultural misunderstanding.  In terms of the food and experience at Grand China, the restaurant has a moderately sized dining room which appears to seat about 50.  Oddly, they have placed a partition at the front of the restaurant so that you can't really see out from the dining room or in from the street.  I don't know what the purpose of this might be other than maybe to keep the people picking up their carry-out from discomfiting the dine-in guests.  Regardless, it is a little weird.  For my taste the food at Grand China is clearly a cut above what you'd find in most Chinese places in town.  We especially like the potstickers, which are large and generous.  We also like the lightly and perfectly fried Rangoon-style cream cheese wontons.  Another great item is the Moo-Shu Pork.  Oh, and by the way, here's a local's tip: Grand China runs a lot of coupons in the local paper, the Review-Journal.  Thus, if you look in the Southwest View section on Tuesdays, the Taste section on Wednesdays or the Neon section (towards the back) on Fridays, you may find a couple of fairly decent coupons (free soup or half off entree)  for this place."}
{"text":"Dining area very clean. Fancy decor, quiet, comfortable booth and table seating, large and uncrowded dining area. Good lunch specials on most days, General Tao chicken is crispy with good sauce.  Mongolian Beef and Egg Foo Young is very good. Hot and sour soup in the best around. Large menu with many options including basic smoothies. Bottled beer is available. Service is always good and consistent, just like their food. Looks like they do a lot of carry-out and deliveries. Me so hungry."}
{"text":"You are going to find anything better.  All there dishes are good! I really love the Salt and Pepper Wings! There orange chicken, mushu, shrimp dishes, etc... all have been excellent so far!  I have tried over 1/3 of their dishes and all have been delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been to Grand China a few times in the past five years. This is an overall review. 

Lunch special, yes. Anything else, no. Up-charges and a la carte makes it expensive for the lack of quality. It's not bad, but it's not great, either. 

I've had rather abrupt service from the front desk host/manager as well as younger high-school/college girls that aren't all that interested in what they are doing. Their way or the highway seems to be the motto. Take it, or leave it. Next time, I'll leave it. 

The sweet and sour chicken delivery was ok, it was good that the sauce came in a separate container so that the chicken would not get as soggy. They took their sweet time to deliver, though, and it was a bit annoying, because even without the sauce on it, it wasn't crispy anymore. They are less than a mile from my house. 

My biggest sadness relates to things I've seen before regarding this business. Expensive for what I received. I 'upgraded' my rice so that it was supposed to be fried rice. There were no carrots, peas, or egg bits at all. It was completely a waste of money. Very disappointing.

I called to discuss this, and the manager said 'that's the way it is'. Very rude, very unhelpful. I'm not likely to try again unless, like I said, it was for the lunch specials only."}
{"text":"This place is right up the street from our home and our friends recommended this place. Our first visit (the pictures attached our from them) we ordered the food to go. It was good and so we decided to go back a few weeks later and dine in this time. The food was just as good and the service was excellent. Will definiltely be back again."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over two years. Today was the worst meal my family had here.
Lettuce was brown, egg rolls were like someone put them in the microwave. General's chicken tasted like it was burnt. Most of the food was barely warm. I truly hope they fix these problems, or start looking for new place to eat Chinese food."}
{"text":"Wow !
I'm from southern California and was in the area. I'm totally impressed.
They have the BEST salt & pepper fish I ever had. And I eat that alot back home in Costa mesa, California.
Spicy and great..."}
{"text":"I was really surprised how good the food was Really fresh!!! Fried rice amazing!!! Wonton soup wow!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. The same old, everything-flavored oil was used to fry the tempura, egg roles and wontons. As a result it all looked and tasted the same (dark from the oil and a horrible mixed flavor that probably came from the hundreds or thousands of meals fried in that exact same frier without changing it) and so needless to say was super gross. The breading on the honey walnut shrimp was not crispy and the sauce wasn't appetizing either - it was sort of slimy and bland. No sweet sauce was provided for the fried stuff which I thought was just weird - I might have been able to choke down the food instead of throwing it away if I'd had some better sauce. Even the rice was poor quality - short grain and not sticky.

Don't eat here. I only ordered from here because the hotel gave me a menu... I guess it is kind of a small market for food delivery in this area? Anyway I should have checked Yelp first... my bad I suppose. :]"}
{"text":"The best Chinese takeout in the Mayfield area by far. The service is fast and friendly and the food is reasonably priced. The lunch special is a particularly good deal."}
{"text":"I love this place! We first wanted to go to another restaurant but it was closed so we started driving around the area and found Grand China.  It was a delight to have lunch here.

I was extremely happy with the service they provided.  The old chinese man was super cool! He was very polite and made sure our drinks never was empty.  This place is so kid friendly! The waiter spoke with my kids and even gave them quarters to get toys from the vending machine.  They have extra fortune cookies because he noticed the kids devoured the cookies.

Now to the food...the food was also great.  Duck is what surprised me the most.  This has to be one of the most tasteful ducks i had.  It was so juicy and the flavors was amazing.  The duck skin was nice and crispy.  The kids enjoyed the crispy chicken and the Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodles had everything in it.

If I'm ever in the area again i will definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"We love the Grand China.  After searching for sometime after moving here from Chicago, we finally found a good Chinese restaurant in the desert. The egg fried rice is my favorite along with the sesame chicken. The chicken has always been cooked to perfection, never dry. My boyfriend loves the Mongolian beef. We've also tried the Kung pao and garlic chicken. All excellent choices. The mixed egg drop and wonton soup is especially good from here. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"As a general rule of thumb I'm pretty lenient on Chinese restaurants, especially the ones with great service. Mostly because I've never been to China and I'm not Chinese so I have never felt I had the authority to articulate why one place is better than the next.
But...I'm going to go ahead and just say this place sucks it. I don't know what it is about the Southwest side of town but it's like there is a vacuum here where decent cheap Chinese food just can't exist.

Here's the BAD:
Fried Rice...doesn't this usually have a few items in it other than rice?
General Tso's chicken...I don't usually order this but i just had a taste for sesame chicken one day, and settled for this.
I think the secret recipe for this dish is sweet and sour sauce and KC masterpiece.
Mongolian beef...This is not supposed to be that spicy and the sauce wasn't even cooked in to the meat. It was like they cooked the meat in the wok for 30 seconds leaving it too tender but also sinewy and the sauce was tossed on as an after thought. Also the whole order was made up of about 9 giant pieces. I felt like I was eating an entire flank steak with chop stix.
Service...Hey guy, can I get a little help?...I can't choke down your crap without a drink refill. And \"yes, I WAS done with that crap, but next time ASK to make sure.

The Good(Acceptable):
The lady that works here is an absolute sweetheart.
The lunch specials are a great price and unlike most places you will be full when you leave.
The little kid who sometimes runs to the front door brandishing a transformer, and stares at you as you are leaving.

If you have to eat it (as I sometimes do) get it to go. I'm sure there is something on the menu worth $6-7. So I'll let you all know if I find something."}
{"text":"Finally something comparable to the east coast style Chinese food. I'm from NJ and this is the only good Chinese I've had so far. I had the classic General Tsao's chicken. Mmm mmm good. The egg rolls and cream cheese wonton are awesome!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 2 star, but I am going to give it a 3 because the food was very good, fresh tasting and the waitress was very sweet. When my grandmother and I came in we had to wait about 5 mins. until the lady in the back noticed we where there she was in the kitchen doing something. She sat us down and took our order she had a happy attitude twards us

Genera t'so chicken- big peices and nice and fresh tasting and the meat was all white not brown like sometimes when places try to cut corners.

Bbq pork lo mein- I asked for white rice on both of these and this one came with fried rice witch I didn't want. I told her and she said she was very sorry the chicken came with white rice. She said she was going to bring more white rice but It was okay we really didn't need it. 

All and all the lunch prices are good it lasts until 4pm witch is a nice change from most places. And the staff is nice, on the way out she said your new I never seen your face here before; I thought that was kind of cute she noticed :)."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food on this side of Henderson! And they DELIVER! Try the Sizzling 3 Delight... It's sheer goodness!"}
{"text":"Solid chinese american fare.  Place is very clean and service is very good.  Stopped for lunch and they have a good menu with the usual favorites and good prices. Probably not worth driving to but definitely worth it if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been to Grand China quite a few times and normally it is good food, good service and great prices so I decided to take my brother and his wife there for his birthday dinner. HUGE mistake. We got there and the server asked us if it was for here or to-go and we said here. She ask us to wait a minute and proceeded to walk across the dining room. Then she literally yelled \"you, here\" and walked away. Shortly after that we noticed that people from the dining room were going into the dining room and bringing out food and bottles of wine. We thought, they must be the owners. After about 10 mins she takes or drink order and it is promptly brought over. Then we waited. While we were waiting we noticed still people that didn't work there were going in and out of the kitchen every time with more food and the party they were with went from a single 8 top to two 8 tops and a few additions chairs added. We also noticed that she had taken every single persons order that had come in after us. So after being there for 30 mins and only having water we were about to leave and frankly should have because it only got worse. She came over we ordered a side of steamed rice 3 entrées and a side order of egg rolls. After waiting another 30mins and people still going in and out of the kitchen I ask about the egg rolls which we saw these random people carry out to their table a few times and she said they'll be right out. 5mins later she brings out 2 entrées. That weren't even close to hot. 10 mins go by more people go in and out of then kitchen and she literally tosses the egg rolls on the table, I tried to ask about the other items we ordered And was ignored. After another 15 mins of more people going in and out of the kitchen  and everyone else in dining room had their orders I finally gave up as I sat and watched my brother and his wife eat. I asked her to cancel the remaining orders and then she proceeded to tell me that it was almost ready (mind you we are talking about steamed rice and pad Thai) I mentioned the people that were strolling in and out of the kitchen and then she began to yell at me say that was here family and she actually asked them to get their own food and said they were here first. I when I disputed ( seeing as we watched over half of them come in while we were waiting for our orders to be taken) that she basically called me a liar.an asked her to cancel the remaining orders. Then she wouldn't get us our bill so we had to ask the hostes. Who might I add was very nice and also informed us that our server was the manager. 

I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that out of the 6 separate people we saw going in and out of the kit grabbing food and bottles of wine didn't have health cards or tams cards. Overall I was completely disgusted. My brother birthday dinner was a complete nightmare! 

During our 3 hours there we watched them carry out 14 different orders and 3 bottles of wine and 7 appetizers. 

I will never go back, neither will any of my friends family and their friends."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and can walk here so decided to try it. Server was very nice and welcomed us to the neighborhood. Food does not have MSG - we asked to have it prepared MSG free. Service was quick and items we ordered were flavorful. We will be here again!"}
{"text":"Service is practically nonexistent. We went for lunch and the only server was on the phone. Restaurant is empty except for 2 other tables. We sat ourselves and got menus ourselves. Food is salty and not up to standard of any average Chinese restaurant. This will be our first and last visit. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Good service. Good egg rolls. Terrible food. I watched the lady pull a bag out of the fridge dump the contents into a wok and cook them. It seems like they are using dehydrated/vacuum prepackaged food when cooked in a wok it brings it back to life Not fresh at all. Not worth your time"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food since I lived in New York City! Won Ton Soup is perfect for a winter flu! Get a bowl!"}
{"text":"Never been a bad meal here.. They deliver very promptly when you place your order. Very good and friendly staff and it's always clean..."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with my food here.  The service can be hit or miss, depending on who is serving, but if you are looking for a vast selection of Asian entree's at an affordable price, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials!  I work nearby, and they have excellent lunch deals that include the price of the beverage.  Their hot & sour soup ranks way up there, and the Mongolian Beef is also top notch."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! That's the only way I can describe Grand China in Henderson.
My friend and I had  lunch here for about the fifth time and it never disappoints. She had the sweet-and-sour fish, a dish I never thought I would ever order or like. It was absolutely delicious. Large chunks of tender thick cod Covered in a delicious sweet and sour sauce that was neither too sweet as some are, nor too sour.  I ordered the Szechuan beef and that too was perfect but could have been a little spicier, next time I'll ask for extra spicy.  We started with a cup of hot and sour soup that was perfectly done and very flavorful.
Can't say enough about this place .... The food is always excellent and so is the service."}
{"text":"An hour wait for delivery- rude staff- order online so you don't have to talk to them, foods okay but the staff will leave you with a foul taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"Fast Fast Fast.  If you are in a hurry or have just worked up a monster appetite, these guys can help you out.  This restaurant is located pretty close to my house and I don't think it is really a destination kind of place, but if you are looking for quality chinese food classics and a reasonable price in a hurry, this is where you need to go.  They have a solid lunch and dinner menu.  The decor is typical strip shopping center with chinese flair, but the service is quick and friendly.  I have also ordered to-go and delivery and the quality has been consistant."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service friendly staff. Stopped by today and dined in with my wife and two year old son. Ordered shrimp fried rice which was excellent with good flavor. My wife ordered the general Tso chicken which came out piping hot and was delicious. Lastly we ordered the peppered steak which I thought was phenomenal it was spicy and the veggies were cooked just right. Spent a little over $40 bucks and that included 20% tip and drinks. There aren't to many good Chinese food places in Vegas so I will be back."}
{"text":"I am not from Henderson, I was visiting Las Vegas and staying with friends in Henderson.  On a Saturday night I decided that it had been far too long since I last had some Chinese food and searched Yelp for somewhere to satiate my palate.  Pickings were slim in Henderson, but I came across Grand China, specifically the location on Horizon Ridge Parkway, the reviews looked good, and I decided this would be where I could get my Chinese fix.  After being seated, I noticed the menu's were very large and heavy (like heavy, heavy!)  I love crab rangoons and was pleasantly surprised to find them on the menu.  I ordered the dinner special with general tso's chicken, hot and sour soup, and fried rice.  Imagine my surprise when the first bite of the general's chicken landed on my tongue and my taste buds immediately delivered the news to my brain: THIS IS EXCELLENT!  I couldn't believe it, this was some of the best general tso's chicken I have had in years.  The spiciness was perfectly balanced with a hint of sweetness.  The chicken was breaded and cooked perfectly.  Eating this food I knew that I would be back for more.

The next day I came back and had the entree portion of general tso's chicken (a larger portion than the dinner special) along with steamed rice and the fried wontons instead of the crab rangoon.  Again, the general's chicken was amazing, the fried wontons were much better than the rangoons (you get more pieces and it's cheaper!).

My only regret is that I live 400 miles away in California and I wont be able to visit on a regular basis.  But, mark my words, when I come back to Las Vegas, this will be one of the first places I go."}
{"text":"Below average for sure. The only thing memorable about thing place was how much of a rush our server was in to get us to order our lunch.

Pei Wei box dinners from walmart are tastier. The wife got four pieces of shrimp in the Szechuan shrimp. My orange chicken seemed to have been frozen-fried and doused in a molasses and marmalade mix - yuck. The fried rice had 2 peas a one carrot chunk in it.

Not even if I was starving would I come back!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is okay, not as flavorful as I'd hoped. Most of the people working there just seemed bored. It was kind of awkward. 

I usually just order food to-go from there, haven't experienced much inside, so decided to check it out. They had some sort of war history show on the TV, seeing death and destruction doesn't make things very appetizing. They were playing karaoke music (without any lyrics or anyone singing) so it was interesting to hear \"My Heart Will Go On\" on an electronic keyboard. And my fortune cookie had no fortune in it! (how unfortunate)

Other than that, it was just an \"okay\" experience. Service was okay, food was okay, but I've had better."}
{"text":"Terrible !! I ordered food online and this is the first & last time I'll order food from this restaurant. I had paid online for this order. The delivery guy came and started asking for cash. When I mentioned I paid online, he said \"that's not possible?\". Then we spent another 15 mins resolving the issue with the owner. Finally, I thought I'll enjoy my food. I ordered \"Chicken Egg Foo Yung\". It's a Chinese omelet. The egg was burnt and dark brown in color. There was hardly any chicken in it. I started to eat but it was so bad that I threw it in the trash bag and made my own omelette. Frustrating !!

Please try some other Chinese restaurant. Grand China is not worth the money."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! My husband and I ate here today for the first time. Very impressed. Nice dinning room, great quick lunch service. I had beef broccoli and my husband had sweet and sour chicken. The lunch special came with egg rolls, friend rice and soup. We got 8 cream cheese wontons and just ordered water. Bill was under $20!! The beef and chick were so tender and perfectly cooked. Really, really good. I'll crave this place everyday!"}
{"text":"A great traditional neighborhood Chinese restaurant! We walked in with a party of 10 at 8:30pm on Christmas Day and they provided fast and friendly service, and delicious and fresh food. We ordered the Canton family dinner and the portion sizes were substantial."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST service I have ever had.  Ordered sesame chicken and was told I would receive it in 25 minutes.  I called 4 times after it passed 40 minutes (the lady just kept hanging up after quickly saying they were busy), and it FINALLY arrived 1.5hrs later.  He wouldn't give me a discount and the food was luke warm.  Not even good quality food.  I didn't even get a fortune in my cookie!"}
{"text":"Good service and pretty good food. It's been here for awhile now so it has a decent following. The house fried rice and egg drop soup is good. It's a nice cheap Chinese restaurant with good service"}
{"text":"Upon entering we were greeted quickly. Our server was polite and friendly. We ordered the appetizer egg rolls which we good. Our main course was chow mein (vegetable), sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, sesame chicken. All dishes were served very hot. Food was very delicious. We will come back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have mentioned this before, but I'm a New York Jew. I also have \"Chinese Food\" listed as my religion in my facebook profile. And I love this place.

The potstickers suck and the BBQ pork is kind of bad, but the entrees come in delectable, massive portions. If you can finish an app and an entree here, they should give you your meal free.

The food here is a step up from China A GoGo. It's not $100 a plate gourmet food, but it's definitely more well prepared than most other places. The service is good, the prices are fair, and this is by far my favorite Chinese spot in Vegas at the moment."}
{"text":"Delivery order - hot and sour soup, chicken with garlic sauce. Soup was mostly broth. Chicken was like it had been pressed through a pasta press. Fried rice was OK. Request for hot sauce was forgotten. Woman who answered the phone was barely intelligible."}
{"text":"Never had their seafood or fried chicken, but the chinese food here is alright. A little on the fried/greasy side, but sometimes that's what you need."}
{"text":"So the food is alright. Nothing special, nothing bad. The reason I'm even writing a review is because the delivery charge is kind of ridiculous. I know now a days delivery charges are the \"thing to do\" but they tried charging me $4 to go about 5 miles. Little over the top if you ask me."}
{"text":"This has been my go to Chinese food for the past 10 years! Chinatown is very far from my home but the food here is just as authentic as my favorite Chinese restaurants on spring mountain. The staff has become like family and we look forward to seeing them every time we eat in. Their lunch specials and dinner specials are a great deal and everything on the menu is so tasty. So happy to have found a Chinese restaurant Less than 5 minutes away. Excellent food and great service."}
{"text":"My cousin was in the mood for greasy egg-rolls. I just moved to the neighborhood and I looked up this place. I had slim pickens, it was this place or another one. I went with this one and it was decent enough. I got a veggie lomein and it was good. Not lick smackin good, but good. Definitely had some flavor. Some places are so boring and bland. I also got an order of the fried wontons. They had potential. No crab, which is awesome for me. They were crunchy, but not enough cheese. Not even close. So it was mostly fried dough with a touch of cheese. My cousin LOVED his egg rolls. They were exactly what he wanted. The chinese mustard in the packages they give you are terrible, however, the stuff they have in the back, is delicious. I mean, yummy! I love the way your nose feels when you eat it. It was very very good. Service, to be expected at Chinese restaurant. Not mean, but not talkative and friendly. Prices were decent as well."}
{"text":"I remembered this place as pretty good last time we visited, so I didnt bother to check yelp before visiting. 

Big mistake. 

If Id read shawn j's review before we were seated Id've gone elsewhere. 

What to add to his very thorough review?
Several things:

1. We were seated for nearly 15 minutes before we were offered drinks, yet the two, count 'em, TWO, teenaged girls behind the counter didn't bother to help us even though they were doing absolutely nothing. 

2. When our waitress finally came to our table the first thing she did was start removing silverware and placemats. I found this to be rude and slightly gross - I don't want silverware on my table that other people could've touched. 

3. My soup spoon looked like it hadn't been washed. How she missed that I don't know. Which begs the question: What else might have been dirty at our table?

4. One of The meals (a combo meal, like shawn the aforementioned reviewer) looked and tasted like it had sat in a pot all day. The combo meals were all items that looked like they were ordered a lot. So they probably make a big batch and ladle it out all day. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, folks, its a duck. By the end of the day when we came in, it was gross. The flower soup looked equally disgusting. I didn't try it. The other two meals were ok. 

5. It was impossible to find a waitress to help us at any given time during the meal. 

6. My kids drinks were served in take out food containers with holes poked in the lids. My kids are small and they had a hard time with this. Plus it was just tacky. 

$42 for a meal we thought was bad. 

Will not return - and will be sure to check yelp next time BEFORE i go someplace I havent been in a while."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the food here. Wonton, & Egg Flower Soup are our favorites. 
The PuPu Platter is terrific,  sesame chicken, BBQ pork,  Mongolian Beef,  all good. 
The service could use work,  depending on the server - you will feel very rushed. We prefer to just do take out,so no worries there."}
{"text":"After reading all of these reviews I'm highly disappointed in what people call good food. This food was beyond below average. I ordered shrimp Kung pao and 8 winglets. 

The shrimp Kung pao was upsetting because I only received about 3 shrimp. Then to add insult to injury the food was just nasty. I have ordered this dish from DC to ohio to Atlanta to San Antonio to Houston. And this was the worst one ever. 

The wings were so small I thought I would die from still being hungry. 

This place was a big let down. You all need to reevaluate what you consider good food."}
{"text":"I love the food here, I go here almost all the time, I've never had the delivery from here BC I live too far but I'm always satisfied with the food. But a tip would be if you get a meal that includes sauce, take it on the side BC that way you can control the amount you put on your food. Because with food like the lemon chicken they drench it with lemon sauce and if youre like me you'd rather have a hint of the sauce rather than sauce and a hint of chicken."}
{"text":"First couple of visits the food was delicious. Last visit the chicken wings were all pink inside the coating. Now I'm afraid to return. So sad. It was good."}
{"text":"Awesome menu. Even better food. Very cozy. Never a problem to get us seated. Customer service is good. Prices are comparable to other Chinese takeout. The sesame chicken is out of this world! Full recommendation."}
{"text":"Truly great service. However, the grub lacked luster all around. Granted I had takeout both times but it is unlikely I would go back. :("}
{"text":"Just had our Sunday brunch... really enjoyed it! Our waiter Lily and the entire staff really take care of us. We enjoy their great food and service."}
{"text":"Been ordering here for awhile. Always semi decent service and great food. Not today! I got delivery, tipped a huge amount and when I opened the bag and it wasn't right, called to get a credit. Not only did she argue about what the sent, she repeatedly put me on hold while taking new orders before resolving the issue. She told me I didn't know what I was looking at. I told her like 10x it was chicken and steamed veggies, NOT chop suey. She said it had white sauce, I said no that's water. She said that's the flavor  um no it's water lady. She REFUSED to credit me and finally asked \"what's your problem\"?  My problem is you're a rude jerk and you shouldn't be serving customers. Never again. Please check all your items before you leave and don't expect any help or reimbursement when they mess up. Oh and I'm calling the BBB too. This place is unreal how shitty they treat people. I sincerely hope they go out of business. Seriously the worst service!!!"}
{"text":"Very good little Chinese Restaurant in Black Mountain.  I'm from the east coast and finally found a Chinese Restaurant on this side of town that I like.  :)  Moo Shu is great!  I only wish that they would make me fried rice without egg for the lunch special.  I would go there more often if they would.  (Hint, Hint)

Good neighborhood Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place sux for sure.  They are feeding mini mouse!  Small portions are for rats.  It's a rip off!"}
{"text":"Grand China is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants to eat good Chinese food! The staff are always so very friendly, if you need help with an menu item they are always good to explain it to you. If you don't have time to stay and eat they offer take out and delivery services to accommodate your busy schedule. The cooks prepare your food fresh with precision, the taste of the food is very tasty and delicious. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a Good Chinese restaurant for the family."}
{"text":"Grand China's lunch specials are my BFF. They make kung pao veggies for me, and it's like a taste of comfort not known since I was in the womb (or so I imagine.) it's always perfect, always quick, always hot and delicious. Oh... I love it so.

The service is great, my water is never empty and the servers don't bug you but they're always around if you need anything."}
{"text":"Ive been going to Grand China for about 4 or 5 years now. Not once have I had a bad experience. When I do eat inside the restaurant, Ive always had quick friendly service. Their lunch specials are anywhere from $5-$7. They include soup, egg roll, wonton and whichever entree you pick with fried rice. Definitely worth it. The dinner specials are about $2-$3 more than the lunch specials but they also come with some extras. No matter what you get, you will usually get more than what you pay for, especially if you stick with the lunch and dinner specials. The service is very consistent between the 3 restaurants I visit."}
{"text":"Great chinese food on this side of town (my FIL lives on this side of Henderson), at reasonable prices. We've ordered takeout before, many times, and have dined here as well (some years now). So, I finally decided to write up my review.   

On our most recent visit, last weekend, the three of us ordered dinner combination dinners (soup, fried rice, entree, crab rangoon, and chicken egg roll) and one in our group ordered the sizzling meats platter (though I'm not so sure of the actual name). I agree with Joe D. about the right amount of spiciness in the Kung Pao dish (I typically like it medium spicy, but my husband's mild with his spice-meter). We really liked the chicken egg roll (flavorful) and the crab rangoon (what's not to like?). My husband had the Pork Chow Mein- he thought it was good, except it was kinda on the fatty side (so he cut it off and put it to the side of his plate). Portions are large, so I took the rest home (plus I had to save some room for dessert at my FIL's house later).   

The server was nice (dressed in black pants, and white shirt, kinda like casino black and whites) and was quick to tend to our needs- drinks were refilled and she checked on us several times throughout dinner. The food came to our table relatively quickly. My FIL was jokingly telling her to change the name of the Pupu Platter, as it sounded unappealing to him (he's a New Yorker, he's got a lightning fast wit). She took it  good-heartedly, casually joking back and laughing.  

Inside is very elegant (not your typical chinese restaurant) and spacious (it looks small when looking from the outside), and the booths have gambling themed fabric. The walls feature tasteful nudes of Chinese women- large framed prints (kinda risque since most chinese places are more conservative)."}
{"text":"This place has a new name.  TastyChina.  If I recall, Grand China was shut down by the health department and sold. The place looks exactly the same.  We didn't see any health issues, but we didn't go into the kitchen.  Food is still as good as with old name/owners.  Service is good and attentive.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is decent.  Lunch prices are cheap but dinner is the same as most places.  The lobby is in really bad shape; they could spend a couple hours cleaning it and spend $200 on new chairs, and it would be much better."}
{"text":"RIP OFF!!!!! Prices online are not correct and the management/owner does not accept the online prices... I paid $12 more than posted on line,,,, and to add to it my order was wrong!!  NEVER EVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. This is our favorite Chinese food restaurant, we tropically get our order to go and the food is always fresh and the service is always prompt. The staff is friendly and always accommodating. I recommend the food here all the time the portions are large and my favorite is the beef and broccoli and the orange chicken is amazing! It's not too sweet or overly breaded and the won ton soup is really good too. This place always hits the spot."}
{"text":"This place is about 2 miles from my house.  Lunch was horrible here. I have tried take out for dinner and after couple of times, it felt like the oil used was stale and food made me sick.   Eh...not going there again."}
{"text":"this is solely based on the waitstaff and overall restaurant experience, not the food.  I will start by saying, the food was great - WHEN we got it OR if it came.

apparently, there was a waiter on his 2nd day and there is no training for the job.  we ordered 7 dishes and received 2 and kept waiting, only to ask where the rest of our food was and the new waiter stated that everything was already delivered to us.  when I told him, that's not anywhere close to what we ordered, I told him to look at his notepad where he listed our order and he said ...\"Oh, I didn't order those...\"  that was FRUSTRATING!  we waited, patiently, but our order wasn't even placed.  when I stated I wanted to just pay what we did get and leave, the owner came by and said \"no, you will get your food and you will pay for everything.\" I stated that it's already been 45 min and they didn't start cooking yet.. no way that I will have my family, including a 2 year old, wait even longer.  

the owner kept insisting that it's the waiter's 2nd day...and I don't know what she was hoping to get out of it from me except to stay, but that wasn't worth it.  I paid what I owed, and she was angry, but no reason for me to stay."}
{"text":"Yay!!! i dont have to go to Panda when I'm felling lazy to drive anymore this place is delicious. had the Mongolian beef  and it had lots of meat and it was soft and tender. My waitress was really nice to suggested all the favorites.  

The reason I'm am not giving them 5 starts is because my soup was a little cold when i got it. i had the hot and sour soup which was pretty good just not wasn't warm enough."}
{"text":"The food is decent.  Not bad not great. The service is poor. The teenagers at the front were brats and rolled her eyes when i made a simple request. I ordered a chicken dish and substituted the meat for tofu and they charged me $2+ Really?! Tofu is cheaper! This place is only close to my house. That's why I ate here. I've given this place a few shots but It's not good."}
{"text":"Many yelpers know I love all cuisine Asian, but Chinese is never really high on my list, especially Americanized Chinese food.  However, I had been to Grand China before and remembered it was okay, so I owed someone a lunch who worked at this intersection and told him to meet me here.

Immediately, I was giddy with excitement over the lunch specials, which range from $5.50 to $6.95 and include entree, rice, soup, eggroll, and drink!  Can't beat that.  The food was good in portion size and tasted fine.  I would just rather be eating Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, or Indian even if it costs more.  Nevertheless, when I got the check and it was $13 for 2 people, initially I thought it was a mistake.  This place is so cheap that it is worth going to with people who like Chinese food and want to eat lunch in Henderson."}
{"text":"I had the orange chicken lunch special and it was some of the best orange chicken and rice I have had. It was so light, crispy, and authentic. It was cheap and great service too!! Definitely worth checking out and I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"After hiking out in the Sloan Canyon National Recreation Area, Grand China was my post hike lunch. I had used the Von's Shopping Center as the trailhead to access the Henderson trails leading into Sloan Canyon. Not too far from Von's but closer to BW3 is Grand China. I'd catch their lunch special. 

  The Grand China lunch special is a hot deal. Literally!  For $6.50 you get a choice of entree, either hot & sour or egg drop soup, fried rice, egg roll, and a beverage. You have to get there before 4.

  The restaurant is more of the cozy than take out Chinese restaurant. It is a full service restaurant.  From the time I walked in to when I left, the service was good. 

  I ordered the beef chow mein lunch combination with hot and sour soup. The hot and sour soup was hot and delicious. I am of the opinion that soup is their strength. A yelper and friend complimented my picture of the hot and sour soup saying it looks delicious. Terri. R stated in her review that the soup was good. Plus 1 for me. This encourages me to return to try their wonton soup. The soup was the strong point of the lunch. That does not mean the beef chow mein and fried rice were weak. Not the least. As a matter of fact the beef chow mein was good. But! The beef chow mein was not as good as The Lotus in downtown Henderson and the food was not as good as some of the local Chinese restaurants I dined in. 

  In conclusion, Grand China is not the best Chinese restaurant in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. It is a good Chinese restaurant that features a reasonable lunch special."}

I have been going here for years now, and do not let the size of this place drive you off, the food is really best I have had around this area. Do not hesitate and try them out!"}
{"text":"The fortune cookie says: Your food is going to suck. Everyone deserves a second chance (I've reviewed Great China once before) so after not eating all day tonight my wife and I ordered a large order of food from Grand China. I got Kung Pao Chicken, she had Orange Chicken. We went with the combo meal and had egg flower soup and hot and sour soup. We also ordered beef on a stick, crab rangoons and pot stickers. $42.00 worth of food. If my debit card could talk it would be saying WTH were you thinking? Oh wait, you weren't thinking. Let's get into why it wants to scream at me. 

The Good: 
The Kung Pao Chicken had more than 2 peppers in it. 
The second young woman who finally took my payment caught a lot of guys attention as she walked around. People watching as they drooled over her made the wait for the food fly by. 

The Bad: 
I started to get helped by one older lady but she dropped me in mid conversation to let the other woman that everyone was staring at help me. 
Unmemorable rice. As in Uncle Ben's 90 second microwave and serve rice tastes better. 
Egg Flower Soup: Take Henderson municipal water. Add some tiny chunks of carrots. Add 1 tablespoon of egg stuff. Heat in microwave. Dump into styrofoam container, send it out the door. 
The potstickers didn't totally suck but they were ho-hum. The dipping sauce for them was edible, but blah. 

The Ugly: 
The Orange Chicken had way too much breading on it. 
The menu says that the Orange Chicken is spicy. Player puhleeze, about the only thing \"spicy\" on it was the dash of black pepper it had. 
Don't call it Crab Rangoon if it doesn't have crab in it you can see much less taste. 
Hot and Sour soup was too hot and not enough sour. It was unbalanced. 
The eggrolls were way too greasy. 
The extra crunchy noodles were super greasy. 

And then there's a special mention for the Beef on a Stick. Take the most flavorless cuts of beef imagineable, add a nice waxy texture to it, heat it, slam a stick through it and stick it in the styrofoam box. BLEECH. My wife ended up putting it in the dog bowl and our dog even refused to touch it. I'm not writing that to make a cute review, I'm simply stating facts. 

In short the second time around this place has made it to my Absolutely Not list. I understand some fried foods can be greasy. But I've had a lot of Chinese food and I know that within 2 miles of this place you can find several establishments where the food doesn't look like it's dripping in Crisco. 

1 star. Only because I have to. And 90 min later the beef on a stick is still in the dog bowl."}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese Restaurant in Henderson. They offer dine in, take out and delivery. The food is consistently delicious and when we have a special order they get it right. We love the kung pao chicken and Mongolian beef, the egg fried rice is my kids favorite along with the chicken Lo  mein. The service is friendly and the prices add good."}
{"text":"First off, this menu on Yelp is fake. The restaurant didn't put this menu up, and they don't have a website with a menu either. They got one of our orders wrong, forgot an order, forgot utensils, and the chicken curry tasted like it was wasabi/spicy mustard sauce that burned the hell out of my nostrils. They did get the food to us within 40 mins, but we are still quite disappointed."}
{"text":"When I wanna splurge on Chinese food I go here every time. Standard Chinese food, so good and the heart burn is worth it later! Lol! Their salt and pepper chicken wings are my favorite here, seasoned to perfection and are so massive!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant a la carte. What I love the best is that they deliver and not a lot of places deliver to my house since I live way out in the bonny parts of Henderson or pretty much Boulder City. The staff is awesome, super nice and I can not say that about a lot of Chinese restaurant, staff seems grouchy everywhere else...I still do not know why. Their chicken broccoli is phenomenal. It is packed with huge pieces of chicken and large fresh broccoli heads cooked to perfection. I always order mine extra spicy and it's still not super spicy but it's 10 times better. Their cheese wontons I love because they are not packed with imitation mix crab or a mouth full of onions. I usually eat mine as dessert with the side of sweet and sour they provide on the side. The chow mein (pork, chicken or beef) is always on point. The noodles are never dry or hard and they taste like they were charbroiled YUMM! The other day I ordered the General Tso chicken and I was very impressed. The chicken was not at all soggy and the sauce was a little bit better then what most people are used to with the Orange chicken, which they also prepare. I still recommend the Tso chicken."}
{"text":"Sweet and sour chicken was decent. About the same as you'd get anywhere else. I thought the fried rice was above average. There are other reviews that mention the woman that answers the phone is rude and unintelligible. Her accent was thick and she was definitely no nonsense, but I don't find her any different from most Chinese places."}
{"text":"Good food and large portions. My son and I ordered and we both are taking to go boxes. He had lemon chicken and I had kung pao chicken. We have been coming here for years with the entire family and always enjoy it."}
{"text":"I tried this place out two years ago when they served the same kind of food other Grand China restaurant. The food was okay, nothing good or special, just like Panda Express. Anyway, a few months ago, I saw an ad in asian newspaper that they expanded their menu and included alot more vietnamese items. We have been visiting a few times and tried different items. Pho is definitely not good, but not horrible bad like Pho Hoang down the road. Noodle soups are the best (vegas standard), the broth is very flavorful. Their combination fried rice is pretty good too. For those who live in SouthWest, this place would save you some driving to Chinatown. Basically, if you think Panda Express is an awesome place, you may not like their new menu. But if you are so used to authentic chinese or vietnamese food, I would definitely recommend it. By the way, when we visited this place the first time, the place was empty, which normally is not a good sign. But after a few visits, I realized that their location (dark surrounding at night) and lack of advertisement are the cause of their slow business. The waitress that works there is very nice."}
{"text":"I thought  the price was a little high but then i picked up the to go box. You get a ton of food and it  is exceptional! 
I ordered the chow fun  with veggies,  full of flavor, not salty, no msg.
I think I have found my new favorite dish! 
Friendly staff, talked with the cashier while waiting for my order.
Good food, good prices, good people."}
{"text":"What a surprise.  I wasn't happy with the typical Chinese American fare that I was normally going to, China a Go Go as their service level dropped considerably and the food was no longer as tasty as I like.  So, I yelped about any new places and decided to try Grand China.  NICE!

1.  Drove - I drove 8 miles from my home to check this place out.

2.  Parking - Strip Mall, no worries, easy parking. Easy to find on the corner of Horizon and Horizon near the Albertsons.

3.  Service - OK, now I went there at about 3:00 pm on a Saturday, so this was not rush hour, and I could sense that the people here take personal pride and personal ownership in working here. This is their place.

4.  Food - This is the real deal and this is why I give them a five.

a.  Cheap Filler - Not too much cheap filler. Normally you will find celery and carrots and bean sprouts as the cheap filler in most Chinese American take out places, not here.  They use the right amount of onion, bell pepper and carrot.

b.  Curry Chicken - Nice kick, just the right amount of spices and the chicken was very tender. To me that means the right chef cutting the chicken in the right manner and using the right high heat to capture the juice and keep the chicken moist. Nice.

c.  String Beans and Chicken - I like this dish because it has black bean sauce.  The best part is that they used real chinese long string bean, and not the stuff you find at the neighborhood markets. Chinese long string beans have a different texture and taste.  Very nice.

d.  Dry Chow Fun Noodles with Beef.  this was perfect in my opinion. Most people will order Chow Mein as it is very popular dish.  Chow Fun is nearly identical, except the noodle of the \"fun\" is about 1/2 inch wide and thin, almost like a fettucini noodle. but thinner. This type of noodle captures the taste in a different way than chow mein due to its large thin surface. A lot of the taste gets on the noodle.  This noodle can also break up or get soggy if not cooked right. This dish was awesome. My mistake was ordering only one order, and not two. My kids ate a lot of it.

e.  Orange Chicken - I have to admit I have been known to buy this yes, at Panda Express, and really don't like it when it has such a thick layer of the flour coating. It is like a small amount of chicken, large amount of flour coating crust and too oily. Here at Grand China, the orange chicken for you all will be very authentic. There is NOT flour coating. This is the real deal.  Very, Very nice. large pieces of chicken with the right seasoning. You can taste the difference between this one and the other stuff they serve at most other places.  Very, Very nice.

5.  Since I did take out here, I did not have an opportunity to check out the bathroom here.  This is always important in an authentic chinese restaurant as the best of them in LV have the worst toilets............ More to come on that when I go back.  But, isn't it odd how the best have the worst?

6.  Ambiance - This is a larger Chinese restaurant with plenty of tables. They have spent time and money to use quality material and decor, not the cheap stuff. This is a place that is more upscale than any other dine in or take out place in Henderson. Almost a real restaurant. When I walked in, it did not even seem like it was take out.  Good for dates, get togethers, larger parties.

7.  Where's the fish - only thing missing was one of the aquariums with the fish (that you would eat) swimming in it.  If you see any chinese restaurant with this, you know that they are focused on serving the chinese crowd with the real deal.....

GK says, this place for Chinese American is pretty authentic for what they offer!  Go for it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before, each visit has been very good. This last time we went there after some deliberation of what we were in the mood for. The thought of Grand China made perfect sense. Service here is always friendly. This time I was particularly pleased with our server who helped us save money by selecting the combo plate rather than the family dinner, and she offered an easy addition to one of the dishes I wanted but didn't have any vegetables in it. The experience for these dinner meals is so wonderful. First you receive delicious crunchies with sweet/sour sauce for dipping, then you get your choice of soup. Then your meal with fried rice, entree of choice, an egg roll and a rangoon. C'est magnifique. I don't love a lot of Chinese food places, but this one is I will keep coming back to."}
{"text":"great fresh food. Hot and sour soup - out of the world. Prices are good. I am a customer for years and coming back for more."}
{"text":"My girlfriend loves Chinese food, so needless to say I've ended up at a lot of Chinese restaurants around town. A Grand China location recently opened up not far from my home, so we decided to go check it out.

I've seen it all in this town as far as Chinese restaurants go - the good, the bad, and the ugly alike. After those mixed bags, Grand China comes as a breath of fresh air. The service is great, the food every bit as good as that of places twice as expensive, and the staff friendly and courteous. 

The atmosphere in the restaurant is fantastic. It is a well-decorated restaurant, and while it doesn't scream \"high class\", it is definitely better than a lot of the \"hole in the wall\" places around town. The restaurant usually isn't jam-packed, so excess noise isn't a problem.

There is a wide variety of food items on the menu as well. And unlike a lot of restaurants, they actually have descriptions of their items in the menu, as well as pictures for many of the items. They are also more than happy to take simple requests (leaving something out of an item you don't like, making an item less spicy if you like it that way, etc.) And, perhaps most importantly, the food here is actually very good!

Prices are right in the middle of the road. My average dinner here with my girlfriend costs HALF what I'd pay for similar food at certain other restaurants - and it is just as good. 

The staff are extremely friendly and always provide excellent service, even when things are a bit on the crowded side. I've been going here with my girlfriend and family for over a year now, and I am recognized every time I go in. And when my family isn't with me and it's just me and the gf, they even have the courtesy to ask how the family has been. Very nice folks.

I only omitted a fifth star because there have been a few times when my order has been messed up. However, as I stated previously, these people are very friendly and always willing to rectify any mistake they may make. 

Grand China is a great Chinese restaurant. I've been going here for over a year, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. I haven't eaten at any of the other locations around the Vegas Valley, but if they are as good as this one, and you have one in your area, what are you waiting for?

Food: B+
Service: B-

{"text":"Hey Patrick, the Ann & Simmons location closed down. Do your research next time!

The food is amazing, I just wish I lived closer to this place.

I love their cheese rangoons, fried tofu, sesame chicken, orange chicken, mongolian beef, everything is AWESOME!

Stay away from Panda Express and their expensive prices and just come here! :-)"}
{"text":"Food was good , but brought out at different times. My husband was almost done with his meal by the time I got my food. They forgot the appetizers we ordered."}
{"text":"Came in at noon so I knew they would be busy. Like other reviews it seems like they only have one waiter. I came for take out so I placed my order and they said 10 minutes for soup, chicken lo mein, and general tso's chicken. Yea this is all for me to last throughout the day. To me Chinese take out is sick comfort food and I feel like death so its time to try a new place.

I understand going into a place to order take out May found silly, but if their website worked I would have saved the trouble, ordered ahead, and probably waited 20 minutes to come in.

After waiting 25 minutes I received my food. It was ok, but I will never get take out from here again. Flagging down someone to order was painful. 

Another reason why I won't order from here again is because I had to order each item separately to get it. When you order the Lunch Special that comes with soup and a soda, to go you don't get the soup or drink. That's half the meal! Why am I paying the same amount and not getting everything? Just plain stupid."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and have gone to a few chinese places that really disappointed us. We went here once because we didn't want to wait for the line at another restaurant and it was wonderful all around. The staff is exceptional, like every customer is their family. The food is amazing and very fresh, not at all overly salty. All in all they gained regular customers from their awesome service and food!"}
{"text":"W O W ... 24 years in Vegas and we finally found a place that serves up Chinese food that we are accustomed to being from New England! As soon as we walked in the aromas alone billowing through the room was very inviting! Even the decor was what you would expect back east! We got a PuPu platter, Wor wonton soup and shrimp with lobster sauce that were all to die for! Found this place by accident on Next Door with people looking for a Chinese Food place and am thrilled! Can't wait to bring the in laws! No msg, not greasy at all and my husband who has a sensitive stomach had no problem! Happy Dance I now have my New England New Years Eve tradition back"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and it was just not pleasing to my taste.  It seemed like I was eating something i picked up in the freezer section and microwaved myself.  I had egg foo young. I hadn't been in a few years.   Now I know why"}
{"text":"I have to say, the more I think about it, Grand China is one of the best Chinese restaurants I have been to in a looooong time.  I can't say there is anything I have tried that I haven't liked.  The service has never been anything less than stellar.  Furthermore, and this is the big one, I actually CRAVE the food at Grand China.  I get a real hankerin' for the wonton soup and mongolian beef, and that's saying something because I wouldn't say I'm really partial to Chinese food in general.  I can't help it.  I just love Grand China.  For whatever reason, this place has become a serious guilty pleasure of mine."}
{"text":"We come here a lot when we want Chinese and cringe at the idea of Panda Express but don't want to drive to the buffet on Eastern. It is very comfortable and quiet. We go in the late afternoon and it is usually empty then. 
 The lunch specials are a good deal, soup, meal choice and a drink for 5.50 through 6.95 range. We love their won ton soup ( It's a dollar upcharge).
 They don't skimp on things, we get cashew chicken a lot and there is a lot of chicken and cashews  it's not loaded with celery.. and they use good mushrooms not canned ones. They don't seem to cut too many corners. But the appetizers are kinda pricey for the amount of food or the quality you get. The beef skewers were not too great (pounded thin), the pot stickers are yummy (not excellent but good) but were expensive in my opinion.
 That being said I suspect they cook on the idea of being more health conscious on a lot of dishes so for many people that could mean bland. And the dishes that are greasy, Hong Kong noodles, lemon chicken ..are just that greasy.  
 Service is slow but they seem to cook it fresh, we have never been served old junk so thats good. Also nice ladies run the place.
 Nice cheap lunch place in a pinch. I think of it as a better upgraded more comfy Panda express...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are really sad that this place is closed. We tried it after driving by and seeing it, and would order it for take out half the time, or dine in the other half. It was clean, well priced, and good authentic Chinese (I can't stand Americanized Asian food). The lunch specials were inexpensive and we never had a problem there, but the place was always a ghost town every time we went. Bad location? Not really, it's very visible and on major streets with high traffic. I don't know what the problem was but I am sad to see it go. Time to try other Chinese places I've had bookmarked then. =("}
{"text":"Very good food... Looking for good Chinese food this is the perfect place to go... The prices are a little high, but it is worth it. I am not big on eating out but Chinese food is one thing that I will splurge to eat one every other month..."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Grand China a few times and have yet to be let down.  Food for 6 (with a bunch of left overs) came out to about 70$, delivery included.  The only thing that kept it from getting that fifth star is that the Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Lo Mein were a bit light on the meat.  In my experience, Chinese food runs the gambit and even with those 2 dishes being a bit light on the meat, the quality was excellent, the portions were nice sized, and every last dish was quite tasty.  My in-laws are very picky about their Chinese food and this is one of their favs."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was pleased.  I came in and was seated and also served quickly by a very nice waitress. I was unaware that this was a sit down style restaurant but they also have takeout and delivery if that suits your needs better. They brought my appetizer and entreé at the same time which was a little odd but no major problem. I ordered the egg rolls and sweet and sour chicken just to play it safe my first time and, though I thought the egg rolls were delicious, the sweet and sour chicken was not really doin' it for me. I'm not the most experienced Chinese foodie, but I felt like they were just masking not-so-great fried chicken balls with sweet and sour sauce. Seems more like a fast food restaurant move and I guess I was expecting more out of an actual restaurant.  Overall, great service,  not the greatest food, at least my first go round. I will be back to try other things from the menu!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese place that's close by. They're the only ones that have cream cheese wontons!  Great food and great service. They're always super nice when we pick up. We've never dined in before but as far as take out and delivery go. They're really great!"}
{"text":"Wow, this restaurant is not up to par lately. I am speaking of food quality. I wanted a more healthy choice a decided to order won ton soup for lunch. What a huge disappointment! It was so unlike what I was used to getting in years past. It was packaged as if it were fresh (broth separated from the won tons and vegetables) but it was all mush. 

The bbq pork tasted bland like it had been boiled forever; absolutely no taste.There was no bok choy, no water chestnuts, not even green onions! There was merely wilted, browning chinese cabbage and broken up won tons. It was like I was eating leftover chinese food and so not worth my money. 

If you are searching for a good chinese restaurant in Las Vegas, keep looking as this place is sadly going downhill!"}
{"text":"Score!  Our local Chinese food restaurant is a total win!  Terrific service, comfortable and well-lit dining room with nice music in the background, and very good food.  Only complaint is that the fried rice seemed a little bland.  The egg rolls were delicious.  Will be back for both dine-in and take out!"}
{"text":"Discovered this restaurant about 5 yrs ago, It's close by. Have dined there probably 30 times.  Have had only 1 negative experience. Lunch or dinner food is always consistent and good. Service is great, friendly and competent. Very quick on the beverage refills!!  They have recently added Teriyaki bowls, chicken and beef. Very reasonable and filling. 
If you want some good chinese food and in the NW area give this a try."}
{"text":"Great food!  Always great service, and freshly made food!  Love the atmosphere, a must go-to spot for black mountain people!!"}
{"text":"I Yelped some Chinese food in Henderson near my job and Grand China popped up with some good reviews.  The lunch specials were mentioned a lot, so I ventured over to give it a whirl.  For a Monday at 11:30am, the place was empty except for myself and two gentlemen whom I recognized as employees of the city, too.  I quickly decided on the Cashew Shrimp lunch special for $6.95, which included a drink, soup, and the entree.  The egg drop soup that I chose was served quickly and piping hot.  Minutes later, my entree arrived and this is when the Yelper in me kicked in because I started counting how many shrimp I got: four.  They weren't tiny, but they weren't huge, either.  There were lots of vegetables to go with the shrimp and also a side of plain fried rice; I should have asked for white rice if I was thinking about it.  All in all, it was a decent meal for the price, plus the place is clean and service is fast."}
{"text":"Love this place, it is the perfect hole in the wall chinese place. China Tom the waiter is super nice, and the food is good. My favs so far are the House Chow Main, and Mongolian Beef. Yes it is slow in the dining room, But you have to take into consideration most of their business is take-out. So don't let that stop you."}
{"text":"Probably not the best chinese in town. But its rediculously cheap chinese food, large portioned and a good variety."}
{"text":"I came upon this place on a reference from a friend. I'm glad I did! Upon entering the Restaraunt, the decor is distinctly eastern, which is nice. The staff seats you quickly, and even though I was obtaining a to-go order, I was offered a table.

I ordered the chicken fried rice, the chicken chow-mein, orange chicken, and some wanton soup. The fried rice was cooked to perfection, and the vegetables still had some bite to them (read: NOT mushy). The chow-mein was really good, and the orange chicken is some of the best I had ever had. The wonton soup was quite good, and I even ate some as leftovers the next day. 

The woman who assisted me with my order was polite and offered good suggestions as to their menu. I would definitely recommend this place as a good Chinese Restaraunt, and I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time in a year of deliveries.
They were very welcoming and attentive. Food was great as usual."}
{"text":"Service was rude felt rushed no one in the restaurant had 3 shrimps in my Szechwan shrimp.  Lunch special. Food tasted like frozen chinese TV dinner.   Dry and salty
Do not recommend this place at all.   You buy and they don't come back to ask how anything is.  Which tells me that they already know!"}
{"text":"Just like NY! I'm in Summerlin and will drive to Grand China for dinner."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Food was mediocre at best. Not much flavor. I had the beef with mushrooms but there were hardly any mushrooms in it. Lots of other veggies in my dish tho. My sister had orange chicken and had only 2 bites. Said it wasn't good and asked if I wanted some but I passed after seeing the grimace on her face."}
{"text":"Had their Hong Kong style pan fried noodles and fried wontons. Not the best I've ever had but still very tasty. Also, they're a good value for the amount of food you get. Very friendly staff as well. A solid four stars."}
{"text":"Been to Grand China a few times now and overall, they have been pretty solid every time. They have a great selection of lunch specials one can choose from available M-F which is great since I just work down the street. The prices for a lunch special are better then me spending the same amount at the local McDonald's and I get served a solid Chinese meal. 

Haven't been during dinner time so I can not really speak for that. However, I have ordered a few dinner entree's before during the lunch hour and must say that the food was just as good as during lunch."}
{"text":"It's all about the Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings. 

Period. End. Of. Story.

They offer ten wings at a great price of around $7.00. The wings on the regular menu are listed under appetizer but TRUST me. This is a meal.

These chicken wings are are too die for. They are covered and bathed in this amazing batter of wheat flour (I finally asked because it is sooo freaking good) and fried to perfection.

They always come out piping hot, crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside. They are always seasoned perfectly and topped with sauteed onions and jalapenos. The smell of their awesomeness lures you in. You eat one and your tongue just starts slapping your mouth around because it is going crazy with flavors. (True story, this happened to me.)

I normally like to dip my chicken wings in something, whether it is ranch, sambal or sriracha. But these my fellow yelpers, need nothing but to be savored as is. 

They have other \"flavors\" but nothing compares to the salt and pepper that they offer.

I am also a fan of their beef dried chow fun. It's always fresh and just good. I always order the stir fry broccoli for my son and they always cook it how he likes it. I just ask to have it slightly well done. They are always willing to accommodate and the server, he is the best when it comes to kids. He is always giving away some kind of toys from the vending machine. Another true story, I took my son's Asian card away from him because he wouldn't eat rice, but how somehow this man got my boy to eat rice. Me and my hunny's jaws hit the table because we could not believe it. That man has got the right touch when it comes to kids. So they are definitely family and kid friendly in this place which is a HUGE PLUS! 

I can't attest for many items on the menu because we come simply for the salt and pepper chicken wings and chow fun. But I do not steer you wrong with these salt and pepper chicken wings. This is a definite must try.

Don't let the interior set you back, it's a little divey."}
{"text":"No! I cannot recommend Grand China anymore! I must have just been being optimistic the other times. It is not clean in there! They had food sitting in cardboard boxes like that would have held cereal boxes at aldi - they had egg rolls just sitting in old boxes like that. 

Even a worse sin than unsanitary conditions is the slowness. I order while at work and then go to pick it up. No matter when I order the food they don't seem to start it until I get there! I waited 35 minutes until I even left to pick it up - still had to wait 15 minutes. They overcooked the egg foo yung while spending forever on the phone - taking money doing whatever - all the while not washing hands. 

No thanks Grand China!"}
{"text":"We are picky.  All we can say is wow.  Great food and great value.  You gotta try it."}
{"text":"I stopped by to order some food from Grand China. Their delivery driver was parked in the handicap ramp and i simply asked him to move his vehicle so someone with a wheelchair could get through. He would not move and then taunted me to call the police. When i started to call the police i noticed he had a DOG in his delivery vehicle and was delivering chinese food for Grand China with an animal in his car that was close to and had access to the food being delivered. When i went back in and confronted the owners they lied to me and said they sent him away. As i was about to leave the same guy came back in and was given another delivery to take to a customer with his dog. I told the owners shame on them and i have put a claim with the health department. I will NEVER order out from Grand China again as they do not care how their food is delivered.......YUK!!!!"}
