{"text":"Food tasted below average, cafeteria quality food would be a compliment. Also was overpriced and the server was very rude. There aren't many other places nearby but if you are on your way to Vegas save yourself and wait until you're in Boulder to find something better."}
{"text":"This was not at all what we were expecting based on the previous reviews.  Food & service was just okay.  Tasted like cafeteria food, at best.  It served the purpose since we were starving after driving to the Hoover Dam, but save your time & money and pack extra snacks instead."}
{"text":"Prejudiced people here. Don't waste your time. They would not serve me and my family as we stopped through. They told us the place was crowded and there was only 6 couples in the restaurant. We ended up eating from a small stand next door instead of making more of a deal. We were told that they had done that to all people of color that stopped by to eat."}
{"text":"The breakfast is OK warning the water taste like it came out of Hoover dam or lake mead the coffee well I've had better it's the water they have a water problem here other than that free Wi-Fi"}
{"text":"Great restaurant inside the hotel, casino just outside of little Hoover Dam. Nice and clean, friendly and helpful staff. Great food choices. We had Reuben sandwich and Lamb burger, both were hot, tasty and fresh, the fries here are thick cut and taste amazing."}
{"text":"I was getting hungry and craving a prime rib but found out it isn't available until 2pm. I can understand that, I was just craving it so much! Instead, I ordered the barbecue burger with potatoes. Everything was super delicious and filling. I couldn't even finish the burger! The iced tea actually tastes like tea which made me happy it was fresh. I thought it was good quality for the price. It's a cozy, quiet place inside the Hoover Dam Lodge."}
{"text":"After staying 2 nights in the hotel, my family of 3 decided to get breakfast before we headed out (9am). 
We were seated quickly by a young hostess and given menus. There were about 6 other tables currently occupied. We saw 3 servers and what appeared to be a manager. 
The menus were filthy and food encrusted. We made our breakfast choices in under 5 min and sat and waited to have our order taken. We watched as about 4 more tables were seated. Then we watched as those tables were spoken to and orders taken. The wait staff and manager actually walked by our menu clad table more than 4 times each, looked directly at us and kept walking. We were seated at a table directly in the center of the restaurant. 
After 15 minutes of being completely ignored, we got up and left. When we told the hostess we were leaving because we were ignored, her only response was \"oh, sorry.\"
Service was way better when the place was the Hacienda Hotel. Since hotel was only mediocre, highly doubt we'll be back for a second impression."}
{"text":"Staying a night here at Hoover Dam Lodge, and decided to take the family out to dinner, after driving to Boulder we decided to come back to HDL and try Big Horn Cafe I am so happy we decided to come here. The wife and my daughter ordered the prime rib, I ordered rhe Philly cheesesteak and my son ordered the chicken tenders. My son is a self proclaimed chicken tender expert and he could not stop raving about them, my philly cheesesteak was good but what made the philly steak and the tenders above the rest were the fries, my son and I  could not stop telling the wife about how good they are ( and no I didnt share) my wife and daughter both loved the prime rib, next time I come back I am definitely staying at HDL and damn skippy I am eating at Big Horn Cafe"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here. The homemade curly fries that came with my yummy chicken Caesar wrap were amazing. Hubby's Cobb Salad with chicken was also excellent. Definitely will stop again when in the Hoover dam area!"}
{"text":"On our way to Grand Canyon National Park we stopped at the Hoover Dam Lodge for a Helicopter tour of Hoover Dam.  After the tour we walked into the Bighorn Cafe and we were not disappointed. The hospitality was outstanding. The premises were very clean. The breakfast was delicious. Two 8oz NY Strips/eggs/hashbrowns/toast/French toast/juice/coffee all for less than $40! The coffee was great too! The Bighorn Cafe helped kick off a great day of touring.  I would recommend this as a MUST stop for anyone traveling from Las Vegas to Hoover Dam and/or Grand Canyon National Park."}
{"text":"Service does not compliment the overpriced food. If you pay 27.00 for 2 breakfasts as I did this morning, the food should be fast, and you should have your beverage refilled.
Neither of these happened for us, and they were not even busy.
This was my second time there, same both times. Won't be a third."}
{"text":"This Cafe' is located inside the Hoover Dam Lodge.  Although the lodge itself is very nice with pleasant front desk staff, the food at this place is Not Good!!!  My husband and I wanted to order our Anniversary dinner over the phone.  (Not Room Service, just Order)  They would not accommodate that.  I went down to order what we wanted and when I got back up to the room with it, the \"Maple Glazed\" pork chop was NOT glazed whatsoever, nor maple flavored.  It was Very bland and Very thin.  The mashed potatoes tasted like box mashed potatoes and everything was cold.  My husband wanted the Chicken Fetticini Alfredo.  Not only cold as well, but was nothing but a box of noodles.  Hardly any sauce to speak of at all and there were 2 very thin slices of chicken on top of it.  I do not recommend this place to anyone, and especially to anyone hungry or prefers hot food."}
{"text":"While spending a night at The Hoover Dam Lodge our family ate dinner here (being that it is the only sit-down option for families).  The atmosphere is casual.  The service was good.  The food was average American fare: burgers, sandwiches, steak, chicken, etc.  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Expensive, terrible hash browns and philly. Hotel is ok but to eat, go to Boulder City."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away near the Hoover Dam. Inside we go a bit nervous and were considering leaving. Glad we didn't. For freshly made on site corned beef, we only paid $22 for me and my wife to get a meal. The prices were great considering Vegas. I got the corned beef hash which was good. The service was...meh to on the weaker side. Good spot for the price and worth going if you hit up the Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"This place is fine! We stopped for lunch after Hoover Dam. Prices were good, our sandwiches satisfying and the service was great. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service from Melynda!! Highly recommend! Food was so good I forget a before picture. Worth the trip!"}
