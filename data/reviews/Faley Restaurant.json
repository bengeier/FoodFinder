{"text":"I've been coming here for 15 years and counting. What is there really to complain about? The food is ridiculously cheap, you get a large amount of food at a very fast speed! If you're looking for upscale gourmet food, perhaps go somewhere else. But if you're looking to fill the hunger gap at a low price AND get your moneys worth then come on down! Dry chili chicken/beef, Special chicken, Satay chicken, Hakka chow mein, are all great choices. My favorite is their crispy beef. Really spicy, sweet, crispy. With steamed rice so not to mess with the flavour, yes please."}
{"text":"Got take out, dine in lobby is pretty small definitely not good for big groups. Ordered the chilli chicken dry lunch special. Cheap and good.. the review saying it's the best Hakka in GTA must be on something."}
{"text":"The Best Hakka place in Rexdale , good food, good prices , the bad ?? closed on tuesdays"}
{"text":"Craving Hakka? Try this joint, it is affordable, tasty & quantity is big. I ordered General Tao with steam rice for around ~8$! They serve a large amount of food and its worth every penny. The General Tao chicken was so flavourful and it has a kick of spice to it. It is not however a spicy diah overall, good balance. I was craving Hakka and wanted take-out. I saw this place and i went in the restaurent to get a general feel and i was satisfied. Clean and good service. Overall, excellent alternative to chinese and great food with good price. Try it urself and thank me later!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. I ve never written a review? but today I decided that my fellow yelpers deserved this so they wouldn't go through the same experience that I did. I ordered a chilli chicken which is something I usually get at hakka restaurants with no fail. However today as I was eating the chicken it was hard and tasted like old chicken. Cutting into the chicken I had, I knew for sure it had to be microwaved old chicken. I would have left with a mediocre review at worst  but the bad experience continued. They then brought out my partners meal, something that on the menu was named Thai spicy chicken. When it came out, it looked terrible. It was smothered in red sauce. Sauce that was so thick and so much on the plate that it started to leak off of the plate. It was so thick that it hit the edge and hung off of the plate for about 15 mins as we ate, slowly dripping it never actually touched the table but instead hung there. It was as if they had dumped a box of cornstarch into the meal. Our waiter never came back. We suspected it was because he saw the meal was completely untouched and didn't want to deal with it. At the end of the meal after we had sat there for a while with no attention the waiter finally approached us with lukewarm water. We asked for the bill and a waiter came to us and asked if we wanted to take the food home. We said no and that we didn't enjoy the meal. She replied with well that's what you ordered you will pay. She next said she would speak with her manager. Which followed up with her dropping off the bill with said meal on the order without a word. We walked to cash and asked for the manager who apparently replied with there is no manager here. Don't eat here. You won't enjoy it."}
{"text":"I can never get sick of Faleys. Amazing food, prices are reasonable and the service is the best!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Faleys that hasn't already been said. This place is fantastic. Best value for dollar. Way better than other Hakka restaurants that change a premium. Love this place. Been going here for over 10 years."}
{"text":"I have taken take away couple of times but never dined in. I have waited inside for food to be ready, the ambience looks nice and quiet and clean place. The food is Halal. I have tried chicken Fried rice which were okay but I liked chicken wings most which crispy and hot. The combo with chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and 4 wings for $7.50 is a good deal with reasonable serving for one."}
{"text":"Great place, like the Manchurian chicken. Portions are good, good environment to sit down and eat with friends. Been in that Rexdale plaza for quite a long time now."}
{"text":"Their food is really awesome. I have yet to find a Hakka restaurant that can beat them. I would question the bad reviews on here.   I have never been disappointed with the food. Plenty of friends and family have gotten hooked on Faleys after trying their dishes. Huge portions and great value.  The interior of the restaurant is truly nothing special - this is totally true. I always opt for take-out - and take out is always steaming hot.. which is really nice. Don't let the location or decor scare you. The food speaks for itself.   The staff is always friendly.   Def. a fave."}
{"text":"Best Part : Food tastes great, and the price is good too. Hot and sour soup is awesome  Weird part: I had General Tao, and it tasted the same as Chilli chicken.I think they use the same type of sauce for a lot of their foods ."}
{"text":"I went with my family during lunch time and we had the lunch specials. Service was really quick, fresh and arrived piping hot. Very filling portions with cold iced tea that helped balance the spicyness. I decided to try the Szechuan Beef on Rice and it was pretty good but just didn't have the wow effect. It was bright red and didn't look too appetizing and the beef was lacking flavor. We also ordered the Chilli Beef on Rice and Manchurian Beef on Rice. And we all agreed that the Chilli beef on rice was the best. So I recommend choosing the chilli beef/chicken/shrimp on rice when visiting! But besides that, it was clean, nice servers, and an overall good experience."}
{"text":"They use plates with a large blue Amtrack logo. Steamed rice was old and dry. Food is just reheated.  Too salty."}
{"text":"Well, this place is right around the corner from me and after reading the reviews, which seems to be a love it or leave it for most people, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately though I'm in the leave it category. I guess I should start by saying that my mom picked this up after we had talked about trying it and she got general Tao and some sort of noodles which she knows I like but being unfamiliar with the \"wet or dry\" options given, she got wet.  I'm thinking the dry would have been much better but my problem is with the actual chicken pieces. Though the flavour was nice after trying 3 or so pieces, I gave up. I'm not sure if the skin was left on or if it was just all dark fatty \" meat\" but trust me., every piece was like that ..just made up of fat. There was only a tiny bite of good meat in any of the pieces and to find it you had to cut up each piece and go searching through the soggy breaded fat. Like I said, maybe we ordered the wrong thing and I'd definitely try the dry option for anything next time but I don't think there'll be a next time for me."}
{"text":"In all fairness I havent eaten much Hakka,  however I have been here several times and have never left dissatisfied.  Recently my wife and I took her parents and brother and we ate like it was our last meal. Szechuan chicken,  chilli chicken, vegetarian noodles, chicken and shrimp noodles, some vegetarian breaded ball with sauce(??)and soup appetizer.  More than enough food for the five of us to feel shame and including the beer for dad was less than $60. Considering we all tried something new that night and were all stuffed - I felt like we robbed the place.  The wait staff was patient while brother asked numerous questions and even made suggestions. We were checked on several times and table maintained and refreshed without once having to look for a server.    Yes the decor is unpretentious and humble but the service is quick and discreet and the food is on your table promptly and still steaming!!"}
{"text":"We were originally not even going to go to Faley's; there's another Hakka restaurant down the road that had much stronger reviews on other sites, but at 7.30 pm on a Friday night the parking lot had tumbleweeds so we followed our instinct and didn't go in. I was apprehensive about going to Faley's just down the street 'cause I'd read some almost disgusting reviews, but once we got there I felt an immediate sense of relief to find the place was packed. We even ran into a friend of my boyfriend's whom he hadn't seen for 15 years, leaving with a bag of takeout.   Considering how busy it was, we were attended just fine. The waiters bring the plates out as soon as they are hot and ready, instead of being lazy and waiting to take a table order out in one (although to be fair, ours did feel like it'd been sitting under the heat lamp for a minute--my pet hate.)  We ordered the Chilli Chicken (dry), Pineapple chicken, Fali fried rice and Manchurian vegetables. The chilli chicken was great with the green chillies but not spicy enough. We assumed it would be hot because there was a red pepper symbol next to it on the menu, but I think we might've got shorted because it was very, very mild. I was eating green chillies by the spoonful trying to up the heat and it just wasn't happening. When I asked the waitress at the end if you could get the food hotter, she said you can go up to suicidal. That's my only complain about this place; our spicy food wasn't actually very spicy. It was the whole reason we wanted to go for Hakka that night.    Anyway, if it had been spicy enough, the pineapple chicken would've been the perfect accompaniment. It would be far too overwhelmingly sweet as your main, but makes for a perfect saucy side to share, especially if you are eating spicy other dishes. Look for the big, soft chunks of fresh pineapple! The fried rice was also probably the best I've ever had, very smokey and flavorsome. The Manchurian vegetables had an interesting cilantro tasting sauce like I've never experienced, but I'm just not a fan of the chunks of onion and green pepper cut like that, so that's just my personal bias.   Anyway, I was excited to have found a new restaurant I would happily go to again. Next time we go though, we will be ordering extra spicy!"}
{"text":"Great food great service. Not a lot of variety all the foods kinda taste the same but great value for the buck. I am a regular now at least once a week for sure.  Lunch and Dinner specials are great prices and yummy, with big portions.  Chilli Chicken FTW!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Chili Chicken on steam rice combo. My favourite!  You can order dry or with gravy.  You can even order with gravy with no hot peppers (for those that can't handle the hot 'n spicy!)  They give large portions and charge reasonably.  About $8.50 per combo meal.  Great place!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you'll crave!   Atmosphere: Small restaurant that is well furnished and modern with it's nods to Chinese and Indian influence. Very clean and relaxed atmosphere with Indian movies in the background.  Service: This a the second location the first being in Rexdale. and now this one. They kept in in the family as this is owned by a relative. They are quick and can adjust dishes the way you want with the staff being fluent in English and other languages.   Food: The food is Halal and serves a Chinese/Indian Fusion. So it meets the spicy yet salty and savory cravings. The chili chicken and Manchurian chicken can be breaded, saucy, dry all equally good! If you have sweet cravings get the Ginger beef."}
{"text":"Food was cold. Delivered really quickly which leads me to believe  that it may be under a heat lamp. Also service needs improvement as waitress  did not know if we had ordered yet. Prefer chilli chicken in Mississauga  still for the price and the taste."}
{"text":"Excellent Manchurian Fish! The chilli chicken is good too. Fast service, clean place, debit and cash for payment. No credit cards."}
{"text":"I found the fried rice and chow mein bland, no flavour to it really. Some rice or chow mein, you can eat it plain and there's still flavour, not theirs though. The bombay shrimp was good, but the portion was small. It was flavourful and spicy, but too much onion and pepper verses shrimp portion. Not an over the top flavourful hakka joint."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner over the weekend with the wife. It's in the same plaza as bamiyan but thought I'd try something new. Unfortunately I won't be going back as there are far better hakka places nearby with better food for the same price.  The place is pretty small but well kept. I got the general tao chicken with white rice and wife got Manchurian chicken with noodles. The food came fairly quickly and was quite sizeable definitely good volume for the price.   Unfortunately I did not like the food. As soon as my wife got the Manchurian she immediately said it doesn't look right as in she was expecting a reddish colour but got  a brownish colour. Then we both tasted it and it started like a curry with alight hint of tandoori rather than Manchurian. She didn't finish it as it wasn't what she was expecting.   My general tao was also off. It was very watered down. Also it definitely  didn't taste like general tao more so like a watered down chili chicken. So ya we wanted to order a crispy beef to go but ended up cancelling.   Now I'm hoping this was a one off cause I've heard good things about this place and so I'd come back in the future if others wanted to go however I myself won t be going back as there are much better hakka places in Scarborough"}
{"text":"Two stars is generous.  Bland Chili chicken with gravy. Pakora was mooshy and mealy. Noodle dish overlooked and dry. Danforth dragon is far better. This place is not worth ur time."}
{"text":"I grew up eating with these people.. I can say the restaurant is like a family to me. Staff are incredible , they are polite, generous , kind and everything more!!! Now I live up north and I come all the way to rexdale for this good!! LOVE it.. Is a bit small but hey it's a gem in the stone , please open up one close to me ..... Love the hot and sour soup!!!!? Yammmiiiii"}
{"text":"This is a small place but very busy with dine in and take outs.  The chili chicken and shrimp pakora were tasty."}
{"text":"The best Chilli Chicken in Toronto, I rest my case!  Faley, a family owned, Hakka Chinese restaurant is a wonderful little joint that serves quick, good portioned Chinese cuisine favorites.  Lunch special is where it's at, prices range from $6~8  Hot tea during the winter and cold tea during the summer!  How nice...  Service is always quick and attentive, they know me as Bob, but there can be a bit of line-up during the lunch hour rush.  The best dish is the Chilli Chicken. It comes on top of rice, this crispy full of flavor chilli chicken with stir-fried, caramelized onions. mmmmmmmmm~  If you want to taste what I just described above, ya gotta tell em to go \"DRY\"  Otherwise, your dish will be swimming in the sauces.  All at the same time there is always a wicked Bollywood movie playing in the background, non-stop!!  Kind of awesome if you ask me...  My other favorite is the Ginger Chicken, it comes with Ginger stir fried with chicken, with onions and green pepper. Now be generous and give yourself half sauce for this dish!  If you are around the neighbourhood, go for Faley's!  Bob out!"}
{"text":"I am giving two star because, Faley used to be better, at least the Rexdale location where I went first. The food is so so. It is family owned and operated and everyone is pretty friendly.   The good part is all their chicken dishes can be ordered not breaded and fried, but you got to it right there will it's hot and your are hungry.   And that's that :-)."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and it never disappoints. The service is amazing and the food will leave you thinking about it for days to come. The huge portions make the best leftovers!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for lunch at around 11:45 AM, and decided to try one of their Lunch specials, which looks pretty good.  I decided to try General Tao chicken, one of their spicy dishes, and I find it pretty A-OK. It is spicy but really good. There was just too much gravy in the food in my opinion. I wish the gravy only covered half of the plate, but it has made the chicken very soggy.  My friend got the Chilli Chicken, which I should have ordered, because I find it much better tasting than General Tao, but I guess I will try that next time I go here.  This restaurant gets pretty packed especially during lunch, so make sure you arrive around 11:30 - 11:45. Even arriving at 11:45AM, we had to wait at least half an hour for our food.  I would go back to try their Chilli Chicken next time.   Review 4 of 100"}
{"text":"Faley's is a solid, small spot for great Hakka food. We came here for dinner on a weekday and the place was packed.    We ordered vegetarian fried rice, chicken fried rice, Hakka chow mein, Manchurian beef, special garlic chicken, chili paneer for five guys and we were all stuffed. There was still enough to take home even! It came out to $12 total per person, which is a bargain for that much food.  I am Hakka myself and enjoyed the food thoroughly. Faley's food has a very homestyle taste to it which is a great thing. Their fried rice is not oily at all, and overall their hakka food, in general, is not as oily or salty as many other places. This is a huge positive as this tends to be a common complaint of many Hakka restaurants. Ironically some comments here have indicated the food as flavourless. I don't find that the case. The faley's special garlic chicken was the best dish of the night, you can't go wrong with garlic! The chow mein was also tasty and full of 'toppings' which included shrimp, beef, and chicken. The ratio of noodles to toppings is quite impressive, they don't skimp out on ingredients here.  Service is good, I can tell the owners care and will make sure you have a good experience here. They will talk to guests and make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Really good Hakkah Chinese food - (Hakkah is halal Chinese food) - the noodles was really fresh and tasty, chicken was awesome like always. I love going to this place every time I'm in that part of Toronto (Rexdale). Also, the prices are good too."}
{"text":"Faley's is the best Hakka Chinese food I've ever had. \"Hakka\" is basically Chinese food with a strong Indian influence, yielding spicy, bold flavours. Nowhere are they more bold than in the \"Chili Chicken (Dry)\" with Fried Rice. It's probably my favourite dish in the entire city of Toronto.   I give this place 4 stars because the service is hit or miss. As someone who's been a customer for the past 10 years, I've had a wide range of experiences. Portions have also slowly reduced over the years. I still think that it's a pretty good value for money though.  A lot of restaurants have opened in this same plaza advertising \"hakka\" chinese food (including a chain called Salt and Pepper). I've tried them all and none of them compare."}
{"text":"Went with the guys from the office to Faley, their regular place, and found it to be pretty bad. Fried rice is a favorite of mine and there were things in it that were unidentifiable. Probably nothing that didn't belong there, but if it doesn't look like anything I've ever seen, then what the heck is it???  The taste wasn't that good. There was something about it that seemed \"off.\" And then the unidentified food objects! No thanks."}
{"text":"great dry spicy squid, all their food is consistently great,busy plaza you have to often fight for parking depending on time of day.good hakka food.not a big place,good service from what i assume are the owners."}
{"text":"This place has been my go to spot for Hakka. I have tried many other places in the city and none of them come close to Faley. If you want the best Chinese Hakka in town, Faley is the place to go. Great prices and huge portions."}
{"text":"I tried to give it a four star but i only go for the chilli chicken . But even thats hit or miss.there are some ppl at my work that faithfu to this place. Maybe i ll try something else on the menu and update the post"}
{"text":"Been here a three times. It's a small restaurant. Seats about 30. Usually quite busy in the evening. First time, I ordered the Faley chicken - it was so so. Second time chicken wings, fried rice and beef and with broccoli combination - meal was so so as well. The chicken wings bit oily. Third time I ordered the chilly chicken dry with rice and it was delicious. Perfectly done. Price is quite reasonable and portion good. Service was attrantive as well."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to check this place out as its on my way home. Today I decided to drop by. It's a small restaurant with about 7 tables and a capacity of 30 people.   I decided to order their Chill Chicken dinner after after the waiter told me it was their most popular dish. The gave me option of having it dry or with sauce. I decided to go with the sauce.   The chill chicken was not bad. Not really spicy (normally I eat very spicy), and quantity to chicken was well worth the price.   The guys beside my table ordered the Pakora Chicken - looked really good. Probably order that next time.  Service was attentive, with the waiter filling the glass of water every time before it got empty."}
{"text":"Who decides to go on a foodie adventure between clients? Well that would be me.  Hanging around Thorncliffe Park gives people the opportunity to have the foods of many different cultures at your disposal as well as unique fusions.  I chose this place tonight as it has been on my bookmarked list for as long as I can recall. It's a quaint restaurant that has a warm and inviting atmosphere. About 15 tables fill the small storefront .  I didn't look too far down the menu before deciding on the 'chicken with broccoli on a bed of rice' thinking immediately that it covered all the necessities of a meal. Chicken was juicy and the sauce went very well on the sticky rice. The broccoli was crisp, if not a little too crisp. Portion was enough for two people who are very hungry.  Was a little too intimidated by that little hot pepper to try their specialty of chilli chicken but really enjoyed both my meal and the experience.  Good for: Chinese food/fusion, small groups, and a quiet place to work."}
{"text":"We ordered food from here on recommendations of our friends in the East York Area. It's a small ok space, serves Halal Hakka Chinese Food. I have to say in comparison to the other Hakka places, this is less expensive. Also they have only Cash or Debit and on Cash they give additional 10% discount. So we ordered Chilli Chicken Gravy, Chicken Hakka Chowmein, Chicken Schewan Fried Rice and Dry Bombay Chicken.  The food tasted ok with the rice being a little raw, the gravy wasn't upto the mark, was more bland and not spicy as it should be, the most disappointing to me was the Chowmein, don't know where they got the noodles from, but also that it had the distinctive smell of inferior quality oil. Bombay Chicken were strips of chicken and no doubt they were very good.  Didn't get a good feeling about the Chowmein and the throat felt upset.  Expecting the reviews to be good, we were overall not happy. Hands Down, Royal Jasmine in Mississauga is the best when it comes to Hakka Chinese.  You can have Faley's when you've ran out of luck and this seems a viable option."}
{"text":"The fried rice is okay. Crispy beef is kind of dry, not the best. The curry beef is more like an indian curry than a chinese curry if that's what you're expecting. It is also pretty spicy (even though we said mild). I haven't tried much but from what I did, I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best Hakka in GTA... special chicken, chilli beef & chicken pakora my go to's. Also a great hot & sour soup. Lunch special is so cheap I feel bad sometimes lol."}
{"text":"I am very surprised with the poor reviews because this restaurant is amazing!  My friend and her husband have been going there for years and always rave about it. Since our office relocated up by the airport, a few of my colleagues decided to try it for lunch. Three of us ordered from the lunch menu specials (Beef with Ginger & Scallion, Chicken with Black Bean Sauce and Shrimp with Lobster Sauce) and all of it was incredible. The specials were about $6.50 and, no word of a lie, one dish was enough for two people. My other colleague ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein and it was cooked (crispy) to perfection. All the dishes came out fresh and piping hot.  I have tried so many Hakka restaurants throughout the years and I have to genuinely say that this is one of the best. I would rank it up with Yeuh Tung (behind City Hall), which is one of Toronto's originals."}
{"text":"This is a great Hakka spot in Etobicoke. I have been going here for several months now and I have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and they the food is great. Make sure you are hungry or bring someone to share with as the plates are fulling.   I had the General Tso chicken today which is one of my go to meals here. The other ones are the chilli chicken and the Faleys chicken special. I ordered it on white rice with gravy and I like saucy meals and as always they didn't disappoint me. The chicken was tender and the sauce was amazing.   Note that the first time you order will be a little confusing as there are main mixing options, but asked the waiter what options they have and they will help."}
{"text":"Still, I think some of the best Hakka joints in Toronto are east of Yonge St. Add this to the growing list. You're coming for the food and not the ambiance.   Anyone mid-town, Danforth area that's feenin for Hakka.. this is the closest spot. I know there's one down the street, but I haven't been there since my first visit years ago and I wasn't impressed. Faley, does the trick.   If you came across my review and don't know what Hakka cuisine is.. it's Chinese pimped with spices/chili's.   Chinese Canadian spots (a few left) it's about the Sweet & Sour Chicken Balls...  Most Chinese restaurants serve General Tao Chicken - sweet with a lil spice..  But the norm at Hakka spots is Chili Chicken - breaded chicken w/ chili"}
{"text":"This restaurant appears to be a Family owned spot in Rexdale. Place is tiny but was very busy when we were there. Here's the lowdown.... * House made egg-rolls good but not great * Chicken/Shrimp Szechuan Noodles were good but to al-dente for my taste. The flavour was kinda bland too * Broccoli in Ouster Sauce-very tasty & steaming hot to-boot! * Crispy Beef...this is in a catagory all by itself!! It was hot & spicy & crispy & beyond delicious!! I'd go back to this spot for the Crispy Beef alone!! So if this is your addiction...this is the place to go for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"One of our favourites. We love the dry chili chicken....the onions are delicious and the chilis make it just right! Hubby likes the steamed rice. I prefer the fried rice. The chicken pakoras are also amazing. Perfect spice."}
{"text":"Been to a few Hakka restaurants, and I always compare to faleys. Still the best in my opinion their chilli chicken is the best!"}
{"text":"I've been here before so naturally I chose this for my birthday dinner with friends.  And MAN was it ever disappointing, almost insulting! We had a reservation for a group of 8 people and they were cribbing about not having everyone there even though 4 of us were there.  There were all 8 of us in half an hour of our reservation time. While the food was good enough and service timely, the waiter seemed like he'd rather die than serve us.  On top of that was the manager's attitude.  He was upset about the fact that we were there for an hour and a half.  REALLY??? It's not like we're getting free samples.  We did for the dinner and tipped as well so why the attitude and impatience? There were 8 of us of course and six of us paid $15.50.  So that's $93 for an hour and a half...I'd say they earned as much as a programmer does.  And yes, I'm referring to the Rexdale location. The Thorncliffe location is MUCH MUCH better in terms of service and attitude. The food was okay this time. I could tell chicken and beef and shrimp apart but the chicken didnt have to taste like it was half cooked only. Also, why the deuce is the crispy beef sweet? It wasn't on the desert menu so why sweeten the beef? My friend got food poisoning the next day because of the chicken.  Also, this isn't their fault but my fortune cookie came with a fortune that was more of a question rather than a statement. HUH??? Again, not their fault but when the dominoes are falling they all come down with a resounding crash don't they? NOT returning here AGAIN! Gonna give that other new Hakka restaurant in the same plaza a chance. They were better."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Can be a hit or miss on some days. Friendly staff! Place is almost always busy, but take out quality is decent like any other place."}
{"text":"Still in the search for good Hakka Chinese in Toronto, came across Faley Restaurant. Food was great! From the chicken manchurian to the Faley special fried rice I would recommend their calamari and bombay-style fish."}
{"text":"I've come to this Faley location on and off since it opened and considering that other indo-chinese fusion places in the immediate area are constantly packed, these guys are better. The place is always clean, I never have any trouble seating a group of friends plus the staff are always accommodating and friendly.   Firstly, the portion sizes are HUGE, and I've found that each meat dish has more volume for the same price. If you have trouble with spicy food, this might not be the best place to come to, as a brief look at the menu will show  3/4 of the items have little chili symbols indicating that it's spicy. I've also found that their service is very quick, roughly 5-10 minutes for most entrees and take out, so most likely some things are precooked/marinated.  The only issue I have is that they do charge extra for rice, it's not much, but it's just a different policy compared to let's say Hakka Garden. Either way, I've been a very big fan of these guys even when they only had one venue in Rexdale, and I will continue to regularly visit.  Recommendations:  -Chili Chicken -Sweet Corn and Crab Soup -Manchurian Fish"}
{"text":"my friends and i got. takeouts and we went here as a recommendation from a friend. 5 dishes for a total of 52$ - very affordable with huge portions, however, taste definitely needs an improvement   Hakka noodles - good but similar to all the other noodles I've tried. think Shanghai noodles with less flavour  Crispy beef - by far the best crispy beef i've had! huge portion and tasted amazing! not too crispy and dry which i think is a good thing. the flavour was on point - a hint of sweetness but retained its savoury side   Shrimp pakora - dry but fairly tastety. full shrimps rolled up in a dough-ball and baked. had a hint of spice to it  Mapo tofu - was disappointed with this dish. in my opinion, it didn't have any flavour and bland although it looked good  Chilli chicken (gravy) - not spicy at all and again, the flavour was not there"}
{"text":"Food was not flavouful.    I ordered the general tao chicken. Did not taste like General tao.  Was bland.  Their chicken spring roll was huge, which is rare but tasteless.  I will give em another try with a different dish to be fair."}
{"text":"I drive 20 minutes to pick up my order. Well worth my drive every time. Manchurian beef on noodles is my favorite. Also General Tao chicken on noodles. Good food, great service. I have been a customer for almost 2 years, and always enjoy the food, and the portions. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Same company as the one in thorncliffe. Very unsatisfying. I got the usual Chilli Chicken on rice and it was tasteless. Although the portion was fair. They obviously don't got the same touch as the other location or they just didn't add all ingredients. I don't think I'll ever be back.   Service 3/5  Food 2/5"}
{"text":"You know I love my chili chicken on rice with gravy. Sometimes it comes out with hardly any flavor but it's a hit or miss with faleys.   One of the owners is really rude.  But chili chicken still hits the spot"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep it short and simple Best food ever!!! Hands down can't get any better! The owners are so nice as well they make sure that your satisfied!"}
{"text":"Several years have passed and my husband continues to enjoy this restaurant while I continue to be confused. The food sucks every time I am asked to \"give them another chance\""}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I'm not a huge fan of this place.   I've eaten at many Hakka restaurants, and believe me when I say that Faley's food is nothing special. It's either too salty, too oily, or just too bland at times.   The place is usually packed though, which surprises me. The decor is very mediocre, and looks like your average Chinese restaurant.   Service is good though, which is what earned the two stars. There was a woman who possibly owned the restaurant who was very friendly.   Otherwise, this place is overpriced and nothing special. If you want seriously tasty and well portioned Hakka cuisine, check out Hakka No 1 at Keele/Lawrence."}
{"text":"A small restaurant located in a small strip plaza, that if you weren't specifically looking for it, you would never know they existed.  When I go to Hakka places, I always order chilli chicken.  I made the mistake or ordering chilli chicken wet (with gravy) once before at another restaurant, dislike.  So I made sure to order it dry this time.  So good!  Had good garlic, onion, and of course green chilli flavour.  Perfect when eaten with plain white rice. Friend ordered Manchurian chicken.  She didn't like it so much.  She ordered it wet (with gravy).  We were trying to figure out what the difference between chilli chicken and Manchurian chicken was, because both dishes tasted so similar.  In the end we couldn't' figure it out. Since we went for lunch on a weekday, these were lunch specials.  I can't remember for sure, but I think it was around $7 each.  For the amount of food, thats a great price.  Too bad I live so far away."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for lunch. Its located in a stip plaza with parking out front, little difficult to get to as the entrance is located on the side street. This place was quite busy during the lunch rush.  I ordered the Szechuan chicken lunch special. Egg roll was the usual deep fried pre-historically frozen and unremarkable. The flavor of the food was very good and I found the portion size quite generous.   The down side was the numerous pieces of cartilage and fat that I usually find part of the hakka experience was more than usual.  Overall, great prices, large portions but quality on the lesser side."}
{"text":"Food is amazing here! Chicken fried rice and pad tai are my top two favourites. Food is delicious unlike alot of the other chinese food places in Toronto. Only downside here is the location. Very hard to find parking, and a bit sketchy area."}
{"text":"One of best hakka places. Been to many Hakka place but their Crispy Beef and Bombay Chicken is the best I have had."}
{"text":"Great Hakka, great prices, massive portions. Not sad at all that I'll be eating my leftovers for a week! The Chilli chicken (extra gravy!) and noodles were amaaaaazing."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special, all these rave reviews about this being the best Hakka Chinese restaurant are BULL.  The Chilli Chicken tasted bland and way too much spice. If you want real Chinese Hakka and better I would try Hakka No 1 they dont disappoint!"}
