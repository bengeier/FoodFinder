{"text":"The variety of food that they offer is surprising. 
Lunch, snack and dessert... food is good, definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love how it's completely runned by the seeing impaired. The ordering process is not that normal and you have to patient. But everything from cleaning cooking and cash handling is handled by the staff. And any money generated goes back to the community."}
{"text":"Simple menu but sufficient for a healthy, inexpensive, lunch or afternoon tea.  I've tried the daily lunch special ( usually rice with meat and veggies, low fat low salt but surprisingly tasty), Hong Kong styled milk tea, curry fish balls and homemade cookies, all prepared by visually impaired staff.  Service is a bit slow but acceptable.  The staff are very friendly.  This small café is located inside the Gibson Centre, without any eye-catching outdoor signs or displays."}
{"text":"Cute community centre cafe right inside the 105 Gibson Centre ran by nice aunties and uncles. The food here is always quite good. Love their fish ball curried!"}
{"text":"When I come, I get the mango pomelo drink/dessert, sans ice. It's a very generous portion for $3-4, and it's very fresh. I've had times where I've actually craved it. Probably the best mango pomelo drink/dessert I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"I had the curry chicken with rice (daily special, it was a Sat) and a turkey sandwich. The curry chicken was surprisingly delicious, tender chicken with the right level of spice along with a good amount of veggies (broccoli and bok choy). A great portion size for lunch. The turkey sandwich ($3.50) was a simple coldcut + processed cheese + tomato + lettuce in a toasted bun. In combination, it makes a good sandwich. The extra detail of the toasted grain bun gave each bite texture. Each meal comes with cantonese milk tea, which is creamy and has a strong tea flavor.

This cafe is tucked at the center of the Gibson 105 Community Center. In fact, it takes up a wide hallway space beside the gym so there is plenty of foot traffic in the area. There are about half a dozen two-ppl tables and a couple 4-ppl tables lining the wall. The open kitchen, cashier and a small stage occupy the opposite wall. Most importantly, this little operation gives VIP (visually impaired person) to work and interact with public customers. The ordering process isn't that different as a customer. You order with the VIP cashier, they tally your order mentally and check it with you verbally, and you place your money in a tray for them to collect. Keep an ear out and they will call out your order when it's ready. Straight forward and easy to navigate."}
{"text":"VIP here has double meaning; very important person and visually impaired person; and the café here runs by them.  I came here passed noon on a weekday and their daily special had been sold out.  I had instant noodle with curry fish ball instead, plus milk tea and mango cheese cake.  The fish ball is pretty good, milk tea is rich and cheese cake is delish.  There are just a few tables along the hallway across from the café. They don't make too many daily special in a day.  Go either early or call ahead.  Great friendly service!  One of the staff came over to chit chat.  She told me that most of the staffs there can only see a blurry \"E\" on the first line of the eye chart, but they are all very independent.  A volunteer with normal vision works with them in every shift.  The foods here are tastier coz they are prepared by VIP.  Come and support them!!"}
{"text":"Something I love about this place is that the food is \"home cooked\" (the daily specials). They're different each week and often quite nice, balanced meals with some unique ingredients like squid, olive meatloaf, pumpkin, pomelo.... These are some of the feature ingredients that I've seen recently.
The portions are quite nice and they come with a drink!!!! I LOVE THE MILK TEA HERE. so addicting.
Something I dislike is that the food they serve each day is limited and sells out quickly. My suggestion is to order/reserve your meal when they open at 11 and then wait 1 hr until they serve it. When I come at 12:30 sharp, they are sold out ...
Also the cheesecake looks delicious. Haven't tried it myself yet though.

Don't forget the proceeds go to charity!

Feb 20/18: lemongrass pork chop with bok choy
Rice was super soggy but I enjoyed the flavour of the pork. It wasn't too salty or fatty. The Choy was also plain/lightly seasoned to how I like."}
{"text":"Concept:
This is a small cafe hidden inside a community centre. It is ran by visually impaired individuals which makes it so special. It's great that this cafe offers visually impaired persons with an opportunity to work and to interact with others. I would definitely suggest coming to visit this place for a good cause, rather than looking for quality eats. 

Food (2 stars):
Their HK style milk tea was rich in flavour, but their food was nothing special (or kind of lacking) to be honest. Reminded me of street food in Hong Kong, or anywhere in South East Asia. It's very inexpensive, which is always good! 

Service: 
Not complaining, but the service is a little slow so you have to be patient. There's not a lot of space to sit, or maybe it was just very packed the day I went haha. I ended up having to just eat while standing. Definitely come visit on a day where you're not in a rush!"}
{"text":"This cafe is operated by VIP (visually impaired persons). The staff is friendly. Service could be a bit slower than usual but that's to be expected since the staff are visually impaired. The HK tea is good and so are the snacks (cookies, pastries, etc)."}
{"text":"4 Star for the Concept - 3 Star for the food

Cultural Cafe has my full support at what they trying to establish. Giving VIP (visually impaired person) a chance to work in a normal cafe setting. 

Located in Gibon Centre with ample parking and seating area. 

Their daily rice bowl offering for $5.50 tax in is quite a bargain. Nothing gourmet but more like everyday home cooking. My Curry Fish Ball + Beef Ball ($2) is so so but I did not expect much and I felt like I was supporting a good cause.

Give them a try if you are in the area. I wish more projects likes Cultural Cafe around to help the unfortunate opportunities to have different working experience."}
