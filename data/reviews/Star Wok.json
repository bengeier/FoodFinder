{"text":"This place is really good, great prices and food I've ordered from here at least 15 times and the only thing in my experience that is lacking is the beef it's ok but it could be better besides that everything else is great"}
{"text":"Biggest Egg Rolls I've ever seen and they are extremely delish!! The chicken fried rice is awesome!! Highly recommended. I'll no longer order from \"Rice to You\" this place is great and now my go to place for Chinese."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in a pinch. I wasn't mobile and was here on business. Delivery was fast and food was great. Egg rolls were amazing. Needed more chicken. Don't know if I saw any but the flavor made me forget the lack of chicken.   Dumplings were great and tried the house pan fried noodles. Couldn't be happier. If the egg rolls had more meat they would have 5 stars. Still great and will eat here again."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area. Tried this place out for the first time with their delivery service. Overall awesome service! Quality of the food was great, price was very reasonable as well, especially considering the portions received.   We ordered the chicken fried rice, General Tao's Chicken, and eggrolls. Everything was excellent; however,  the egg rolls were primarily cabbage. That being said, the eggrolls were crunchy and the cabbage tasted good. Will be ordering again in the future!"}
{"text":"Great prices and the food was prepared quickly for us to pick up. It was still very hot when we got it despite being held up by traffic. The guy helping me was super polite and made sure we had forks, and the plates they gave us were a very nice addition.   Unfortunately, the food was not great. We had 3 entrees and got a side of fried rice with each entree. I've never had fried rice before that had nothing in it: there were no eggs, no meat of any kind, no vegetables. The rice itself tasted funky, totally bland with an aftertaste like maybe the rice was old.   The General Tso's and sweet & sour pork were both totally bland without the sauce. The sweet & sour pork was a little over done, but the veggies for the could have been cooked longer, they were practically raw.   The best part of our meal was the cashew chicken. The sauce had good flavor, veggies were almost perfect and the chicken was tender. But it wasn't good enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. New to area and know good chinese food. Decent prices. Ordered egg rolls, general tso chicken, crab wontons and fried rice. Fried rice was a deep dark color that looked like it was cooked with too much soy sauce. I was wrong. The rice tasted great! The egg roll was large and crispy and packed with cabbage and a little meat but the cabbage was seasoned well and the egg roll tasted great also. Crab wontons were great. General tso chicken was was the only thing that was good not great. Wifes entree was very good also. will definately be ordering from them again. Glad I finally found some good chinese food. I only give 5 stars for amazing food. Great gets 4."}
{"text":"Just ordered got my delivery got back to the truck an wow this is beautiful y'all ain't stingy with the sweet an sour sauce the sesame chicken looks bomb the noodles smell mad fresh!! I'm about to get fat I recommend and Trucker that does not want to eat subway An gotta taste for Chinese hit this place up!!"}
{"text":"Delicious delicous delicous! Friendly staff, and very generous portions on every order. I don't live in Arizona but I do travel to the state at least 3-5 times a year and when I do I stop by here to fulfill my chinese food cravings. 4.5-5 stars for great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"Hey ! very good .... found this place just walked in there. Very simple place , made the order and bam they jumped on to it , watched them cooked on their Wok's . Good portion of food and food is hot . Now I usually take home when we don't want to cook , it takes me 3 minute drive and food is hot to eat. Try it out..."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time asked for Chicken chop suey they gave me chicken lo mein. The sweet n sour had a metallic after taste. Don't think I will order again. :("}
{"text":"You should be able to give 0 stars!  I ordered egg foo young, General Tso chicken and chicken chop suey at 3:17pm and was told 10 minutes. I got caught in traffic and didn't arrive until 15 minutes later at approximately 3:32pm. He, cashier, asked my name and then said it was coming right up. 3:40pm still no food- and he asks me my name Again! No food ready but asked if I could pay now. I asked him if my order had even been started. But I'm pretty sure you guessed correctly.......it had not- he was unapologetic, offered nothing in lieu of my time, not an egg roll, not a won ton- just a complimentary look of indifference. I love good food but I work hard for my money and nothing leaves a bad taste in my mouth like paying for bad service! I can get my Chinese food fix somewhere else where the customers are treated with respect."}
{"text":"Fast service and polite service! Food was hot and delicious and they even remember that I asked for no ice in my drink! Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"I am a truck driver & was stuck in the shop so I ordered delivery & was pleased with my order.  The driver was very nice & friendly!  The egg rolls were very good.  The cashew chicken was ok.  I also got an order of veggies & they were as expected.  I was so full I decided to save the soup for tomorrow!  I would order from here again when in town."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Rice is dry, veggies over cooked, Taos chicken was so disgusting my pet wouldn't even touch it. My wife had veggies and it looked liked someone had pre-chewed it for her. The sight of the food was just completely unappealing. NEVER ordering food from here again."}
{"text":"It's always my favorite Chinese place to order from I'm pretty sure the owner knows me well and he makes it just right as soon as he hears my phone number now that's love"}
{"text":"Love Star Wok! The pot stickers are just like what my wife makes and are amazing. The egg rolls are huge and very tasty! I about didn't have room for my main entree but it too was amazing!"}
{"text":"Everything was great... I devoured the food. We got combs and I was totally impressed."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the past eight years and they have the best Chinese food in the West Valley.  They have the best Chicken Fried Rice, not to mention their Singapore Noodle Bowl and Spicy Prawns are excellent. If you are looking for a heartier meal, the Egg Foo Yung (chicken or shrimp), will more than satisfy an appetite.  There is another good thing about the restaurant...the service. You can call ahead and everything takes 5-10 minutes to prepare. They are friendly and always welcoming.  Finally, the restaurant is sandwiched between a barber shop and an ice cream parlor...hey, get a fresh haircut, a great Chinese meal and top it off with dessert!"}
{"text":"Great prices. Beyond great food. Friendly staff. COOKED TO ORDER 5 FEET FROM YOUR FACE. hello!?!? Tell me where you can get all these great things all under one roof?!? 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for delivery in my area and this was the only one that came up. First time eating at Star Wok.  The overall taste of everything was satisfying.  Ordered Vegetable Egg Foo Young (bummed it didn't come with any vegetables), sweet n sour chicken (came with 2 small pieces of bell pepper), egg rolls (huge!), and the sesame chicken kids meal (comes with a drink). So how can veggie egg foo young cost the same as ones with meat, yet all it comes with is the sauce and 3 large egg patties??  Should cost a little less since nothing comes with it (topping-wise). But it tasted good. The sesame chicken for the kids meal, well, let's just say we won't order it again.  From taste to look, just didn't even bother feeding it to the kiddos.  The drink? Apparently the Sprite box was out because all we got was ice and soda water.  We most likely will give it another whirl, but I can tell it'll just be for specific items.  Plus, they deliver for $1.50, better than some other spot wanted $9!"}
{"text":"I tried this place about 7 years ago and have been coming back ever since.  The people are always nice, the food is always good, and they give you huge portions so it's worth the price(although it's not expensive) even now, living pretty far from here, I go out of my way to get it once in awhile, like today.  Totally worth the drive. Another plus, they're so sweet to my kid."}
{"text":"I was actually Very Surprised at This Experience. The Food was Piping Hot, Very TASTY, My Order Was Very Fulfilling and Hit The Spot !!! When I am Driving thru States in My Truck its nor very often that I gamble w my food choices n my stomach.  But I had a taste for Chinese Food and Star Wok Nailed it !!! The Timing Was Fast and The Food Was Great and Everything that I needed was in my bag. ( soy sauce, chili sauce, plates, knives n forks and My Fortune Cookies ) . Thank You Star Wok. You Shall Most Definitely Be My Go To Spot For Chinese Food in AZ."}
{"text":"One word: AMAZING! The food we have gotten from there has always been hot, perfectly cooked, and exactly what I'm looking for in terms of flavor. The egg rolls by far surpass every other place I have been to in Phoenix, the fried rice has never been dry, and the veggies are always crisp and never soggy or gross. I have tried their chicken, beef, and pork and have never been dissatisfied. Just a great place to eat. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've had delivery from here 3 times now and the food is always delicious and the delivery is always super fast! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"It's actually not a very good place all said. Their steamed rice was already stale. I ordered the Orange Spare Ribs, Snow Pea Chicken, Steamed Vegetable, Iced Tea, BBQ Pork Slices, and Salt & Pepper Spare Rib.  The Snow Pea Chicken is the safest, and most delicious item but it's as boring as it is anywhere else.   The Orange Spare ribs are delicious, but the butchery job on these is poor and there is a lot of bone shards and gristle. Very hard to eat compared to good quality spare rib.  Steamed vegetable were old tasting.   Iced tea is actually raspberry super sweet fake iced tea.  Pork Slices were dry but edible, may turn them in to fried rice with the stale rice.  And finally, the salt & Pepper Spare Ribs were just gross. I am sad I wasted the most money on them because they are disgusting.  I suspect this is the type of place to stick to basic pork and chicken dishes."}
{"text":"I was looking for a different take out place for Chinese food and found this place near my home. The rating looked great so I had to try. When I walked in the restaurant was small but clean and the staff was helpful and kind. I got the meal combo which includes one entree, drinks, egg roll & side. I chose the Orange chicken & half low mein/ fried rice. I would define the food as average sloppy Chinese. I left two stars instead 3 because I wouldn't eat that again. Orange chicken had good flavor but lacked crispy consistency and rice & lo mein were boring and sloppy. Good service poor quality food for my taste."}
{"text":"Good enough for when I want food quick and don't want to cook.   The wonton soup is pretty good, and the pan fried dumplings are wonderful. My husband loves the beef lo mein. The one thing I judge all Chinese places on is the sesame chicken though...theirs is sickeningly sweet. It's  nice and crunchy which is fantastic, but I think the sauce is 90% sugar. I had some left over one night so I put it in the fridge. The next day the sauce was rock hard instead of a thick sauce or gel consistency. It was as if someone embedded chicken chunks in to rock candy.  So: if sweet is your thing, get the sesame chicken. If you want prompt and friendly service, go here.   I will continue to order from them and just avoid the chicken :)"}
{"text":"The best delivery Chinese food around. Their portions are great and their staff is friendly. My goto whenever I want Singapore noodles. Plus they have kids menu which was the first I've seen at a place like this. Always recommend."}
{"text":"Unlike panda express this place cooks to order which is a good thing in my opinion. The combo with honey chicken, kung pao chicken, and white rice was very good."}
{"text":"I love their food it's amazing it's perfect especially for the late night when you're too tired to drive but still hungry and they deliver they have the best Chinese food I've ever had and it's not to exspensive"}
{"text":"Small little place, but is best for takeout when we don't want to cook. The food is good, way better than Panda Express! I always believe Chinese food needs to be cooked by Chinese people not Mexican. Will definately order again when we visit AZ!  Added bonus with the guy name Tony who took my order, he was very friendly and made sure we had enough. Thanks for you great service tony!"}
{"text":"I get Star Wok when I am at work as I can't leave for lunch. If I forget my lunch (which is all the time) I can count on Star Wok to get me good food fast."}
{"text":"Place is great and price is very fair and made fresh every time I've ordered. Homemade egg rolls are large and tasty the portions are good and very filling."}
{"text":"Great food A couple of tables  Very nice people If your eating in and don't like plastic byos. Bring your own silverware which isn't a big deal when you think about.   Noodles. Awesome vegetables delicious  Excellent choice  Support family owned businesses"}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get house noodles and house rice. Only one time the food has been off.  Yesterday I ordered again the usual, and I asked for sweet and sour and chili sauces, I got an earful about next time I order make sure to ask for them so that they are in the bag. All this because I asked for a small bag for my sauces and he refused to get me a small bag instead he took 5 min to undo the maze of a knot he had tied on the bag. All the while he is going on in his native tounge I think he was telling me how much he appreciated my business, finally got my sauces in the bag and I asked him to not tie the bag. Are you sitting down he tied the bag double knot. Beside that great food. I still love that place just chill sauce nazi"}
{"text":"This place has good food and good prices.  Egg rolls could be better but not a deal breaker for me.  Lots of my coworkers also order from this place."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed my Mongolian beef!! Very delicious and was not shorted on the meat. Was delivered within a reasonable time frame and still hot."}
{"text":"might be the worst chinese food I've ever had! spent nearly $40 on delivery.   so dissapointed. how can you possibly screw up orange chicken? you did...... soggy, flavorless mush.   I guess your answer to fried rice is to just drown white rice in soy.    can't believe you have any repeat customers? how are you even open for business. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE"}
{"text":"Very mediocre.  Cool people.  Just not that good.  I will dig deeper in the future on the ratings.  Other people seem to like this.  Try a real place like Chous kitchen"}
{"text":"Star Wok are my dudes. Great food, better prices and everyone that works there is super nice. They really value their customers. I've been ordering from them for several years. Glad to see them doing well."}
{"text":"Well, food is good, but I'm missing some of my order.  I ordered online, grubhub supposedly was delivering (guy never said he was grubhub.  Looked more like one of the guys from resteraunt), never got a receipt so now I cant prove what I ordered.  Missing a shrimp walnut entree and fried noodles.  Otherwise food was good, no hot mustard sauce either.  Sorry, I would give more stars for the food, but I dont like doing business when no receipt comes and half the order is not there"}
{"text":"Great singapore noodles, large portions, will take-out from here again"}
{"text":"Just disappointed, ordered mongolian beef and orange chicken and egg roll. First, mongolian beef. Taste burnt and u can tell it is not fresh. Orange chicken, taste so good! BUT its not fresh. And egg roll. It is big!! And taste amazing!! Fresh and crispy!! But the main dish is so disappointed :( i love the taste honestly. It is good combo with rice coz i love rice and i eat everythng with rice. I stopped eating coz the chicken and beef is so chewy and like a rubber. I will try another menu next time."}
{"text":"I ordered food through the Yelp app for the first time and I am extremely impressed!!! I got my food within 20 minutes and got everything I ordered minus the hot sauce but hey, The food was fresh! Hot! Delicious! And FAST!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here 2 nights ago and the food was great. I ordered the fried chicken and pork short ribs in orange sauce. The fried chicken was a little bit dry but still tasty. Their rice was actually the weakest point of the meal because it was really dry.   The delivery came about 5 mins late and the driver apologized immediately. I'm assuming he got lost in my neighborhood, which was no big deal. I found it charming that he seemed to sweat the 5 mins more than I did.   Overall though, I would order from here again.   Pros: Good serving sizes, good price, tasty food.  Cons: Long wait time for the delivery (60 mins from order time to delivery time), dry rice."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here, and it was their first night open! It was delivered in a half hour piping hot. Delivery man was very friendly. I got the Mongolian beef and it really was the best I've had. Egg roll was crispy and delicious. My daughter said the orange chicken was \"the bomb\". I will order from here again the price was right . Star wok 11"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good!! Good service, and my order was made very fast! I called another place and they didn't want to deliver.  It was only 3 miles away. It was cool, I walked to this place. No delivery, no tip. HA!! Revisit for sure."}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from the 3 times now, within 1 month!  We love this place.  I have got my grandparents and parents hooked too!  Good portions and very tasty.  Our favorite is the Mongolian beef, yum!"}
{"text":"Want friendly service, good prices, safe location? Don't stop,keep going! Located in a strip mall near a smoke shop and a QT many unsavory characters milling around. Recently moved nearby and explained that I like Chinese food and need a go to place for my fix. I ordered the lunch special take-out. Thinking they would like my return business, they would make my order especially robust. WRONG! Upon opening, found egg rolls missing, small scoop of fried rice and lo mien and 2 small pieces of beef with broccoli and as a bonus...all cold and bland. Also missing, fork, napkins, condiments and the traditional fortune cookie. No drink order. Total, almost $9! WOW. No wonder it's always empty of customers. Too bad! :-("}
