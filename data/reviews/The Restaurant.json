{"text":"Place is amazing historical really beautiful food top of the line. Next time you ever stop by please have Windy recommend you the best meal on the Manu plus the price is affordable"}
{"text":"Great place with friendly service. Food has alway been very good. When ever we have a stay-cation we stay and eat at this charming hotel."}
{"text":"What should have been a pleasant Sunday morning breakfast was turned into a negative experience when waitress asked us to leave so she could seat another party. We were shocked but left. We had been there about 30 mins and were finishing coffee. She said another party had been waiting 20 mins for seat. Wonder if this is their policy! Will never go back."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch. Service was good and our server sweet. Unfortunately the food was below average. I had the Eggs Benedict and the hollandaise was surprisingly decent and egg cooked pretty well. The rest wasn't very good. The home potatoes were soft on the outside and minimally warm. The English muffin barely toasted. My husband had a basic breakfast that he stated was average. Everything was lukewarm.   The positives are it is a lovely hotel built in the 30s and the ambiance is lovely. You can do the Boulder City walking tour from the hotel. It is about 1 mile and if you bring your cell phone with a QR app you can read about the points of interest in this historic neighborhood. It is a nice addition to just having breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent place to have a meal and a fresh salad! I had the Monte Cristo and my friend had the grilled cheese and salad! The salad bar was very fresh! Loved the cucumber dressing! The ambiance is historic and don't miss the museum upstairs."}
{"text":"First time to visit this restaurant for breakfast with another couple.  Got right in and was seated which was nice.  Food is nothing to rave at, basic breakfast fair.... Once we had finished eating we were drinking our coffee when the waitress walks over a says\" You'll have to leave we need your table\". We had been seated a total of 45 minutes.......we all had a shocked look on our face to say the least.  We did leave at that point but noticed other tables open. While in the lobby the waitress came to the front desk so I asked if it was their policy to ask people to leave, she said well there was a party of six waiting and we needed your table........ This is not a good business practice I can assure you.  We are not tourists to Boulder City so this is how they treat locals.....will never go back and I would advise anyone thinking of eating there to find any place else.  There are two good places on the main street and they let you finish your coffee.  I left a message for the manager about what happened.....Lovely Boulder City....."}
{"text":"In this day and age what decent restaurant refuses an alternate for carbohydrate? My dining partner quite sweetly asked for sliced tomatoes or for the waitresses suggestion in lieu of toast. Flat out refused!!!   There was no offer of an extra egg or even some lettuce! No effort on the waitresses part what so ever! Not even a \"let me ask our manager!!!! Nada blip.... Nuttin!  I'm sure if the next table ordered Extra Toast they would get charged for it...  Coffee was just coffee! Their Orange juice tasted like the fresh squeezed elixir I buy at Whole Foods on special occasions!!!  Corned beef was rich and yummy!  Chicken fried steak surprises me each time I've had it! Breeding still crispy under a thick ladle full of piping hot gravy! Lip smacking good!"}
{"text":"We had incredible service and a fabulous breakfast.  I think they make the bestest corn beef hash I have ever had!   Loved the waitress!  She was 10 point 10 in personality and service~ This place is a must if you are in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Loved the sweetness of the little Hotel Cafe but good was bland. My daughter and I had 2 different lunch meals and neither were very good."}
{"text":"I don't know why some people don't like it here based on previous reviews because everything (service, food, and ambiance) were great. My friend had the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant, and I had the tuna melt. Their soup and salad bar was well stocked and had fresh ingredients which is rare to find at most salad bars. Friendly service and large portions on food that's actually good quality. Bathrooms are clean and the restaurant and hotel look like it's maintained well. Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"First time here and love this hidden gem. Everything is so fresh and made from scratch. And $5 mimosas to top it off.  Ill def be a regular here"}
{"text":"Breakfast is included when you're a guest at the hotel. I chose to make my own omlete - avocado and mushroom. I think I got a whole avocado! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service located in historic downtown Boulder. Very inexpensive and good food. What more can you ask for. Inside Boulder Dam Hotel"}
{"text":"We have breakfast here every weekend. The food is really good and Maria is the best server!"}
{"text":"Well I can only rate this based on the things I ordered  Unfortunately the soup, bloody Mary, and chicken bacon wrap I ordered were quite unimpressive. Bloody Mary was not up to par and for a bacon wrap you'd expect a bit more bacon, and the soup was just plain almost right from the can. It was more of a lettuce wrap then anything.  Maybe the other items on the menu are better. The customer service was good though."}
{"text":"Free breakfast for hotel guests, which is why we were here. The coffee is... not... good... at.... all. I've had horrible coffee, try to cover the taste with cream and sugar. I still couldn't drink it. I don't know what kind of coffee they're brewing, my guess is Folgers. Anyway, coffee aside, the breakfast was okay. I had an omelette. My husband had the biscuits and gravy. Neither were rave worthy. They were not bad. Kinda the Denny's feeling going on. My recommendation is to stick with orange juice (not coffee) and order simple, eggs, bacon and toast. I don't think I would have been disappointed going that route.  Update: day 2- went with the simple breakfast (eggs, bacon, hash browns) skipped the coffee and had OJ instead. Much better experience than yesterday."}
{"text":"I do not get to come up here very often, so it is a treat when I can.  When I was a kid, my parents would bring up here on special occasion lunches I.e last day of school, birthdays etc. For many years, the Hotel was closed. It has had its share of open years and closed years during its long history. We have been lucky, because the Hotel has been open for many years and it is a great experience.  It is only open breakfast to lunch. There is a good selection of options, but not enough to cause problems. I usually order breakfast items. I really enjoy the Eggs Benedict but the build your own omelet  is also very good. Do yourself a favor and order the salsa along with your omelet."}
{"text":"Service started out great but towards the end of breakfast still visiting with another couple  told  to leave they needed the table...there was no line so I don't get it We won't be back"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed....I've been here before and their chicken pot pie was amazing. But this time it was awful I feel so bad that I made him drive an hour out of our way because I wanted a chicken pot pie. Customer service is good love the fact that we can sit outside and eat.... the food just isn't that good. Ooooo we also had Bloody Mary's that we didn't finish :("}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. My wife and I were just wondering around Boulder City. We were hungry. This is the first place we saw that looked welcoming. Outdoor seating. Salad bar. Good choices on the menu. I asked the waitress what customers thought of the fish n chips. I was surprised to see this on the menu in this desert town. But, she said people loved them. I ordered them and she was right. Amazing to get such top notch fish n chips anywhere."}
{"text":"THE RESTAURANT OF BOULDER DAM HOTEL     I enjoy dining in charming restaurants that are unique or historical serving decent food. Recently before Lake Mead adventures,  I have stepped back in time to delight in having breakfast in the Restaurant.     The Restaurant is the eatery of the historic Boulder Dam Hotel. It is a historic landmark listed on the Register of Historic Places dating back to 1933. To give you an idea of its historic significance, they built it eight years prior to the Elite Rancho, which was the first luxury hotel built on the Strip. Famous guests that visited it include Bette Davis, Shirley Temple, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and Will Rogers. In recent times, when I had breakfast here, I was most likely seeing the exact dining room that the above celebrities saw. As soon as I entered the Boulder Dam Hotel from historic Arizona Street, and made a left by registration into the Restaurant,  history overloaded the scences. I wasn't in Vegas anymore.     This restaurant preserved in time is a sun room in the corner of the Boulder Dam Hotel. And this sunroom is two separate rooms that get a lot of sun that form an L around the kitchen. Both times that I had breakfast here, the custom was to seat yourself.    The Restaurant focuses on breakfast and lunch. Recently they have reopened a few hours for dinner on certain days of the week. The first time I dined here, I had the BLT. It was inferior to The Coffee Cup and Mel's Diner. They were very stingy with the beacon to the point that I felt like I was eating an LT. I ordered it on sourdough bread but they served it on toast. The steak fries that came with it were quality. If it wasn't for the historic environment, I most likely would of passed over the follow-up visit for the Coffee Cup. But what a Big Dam Breakfast. This is what I had on the second visit. It was breakfast overload served on two plates. It included two large buttermilk pancakes, two scrambled eggs (you could choose the type), slices of beacon (you could get sausages), house potatoes with rosemary (you could get hash browns), and fruit. Now this was quality and quantity. They served water with the meal. And the coffee was allright. The average breakfast bill is between $10 to $15.    Just like in historical times, progress was on the slow side. Service was on the slow, yet friendly side. Plus the Waitress was on top of the coffee refills. Considering the Boulder Dam Hotel is a preserved building, it isn't a surprise that a walk to the restroom is outside the restaurant and across the small and quaint lobby.    History does not have to end when you pay the bill. Upstairs from the Restaurant is the Boulder City and Hoover Dam Museum. It is $2 well-spent on a quick history of Hoover Dam and Boulder City.    I recommend experiencing the Restaurant for its historical, unique environment and Big Dam Breakfast. It is a nice stop-off on the way to Hoover Dam, Lake Mead National Park, or Arizona. You live once!"}
{"text":"Finally Boulder City has another wonderful option for dining downtown. We have enjoyed The Restaurant inside the Boulder Dam Hotel for years for breakfast and lunch - it never disappoints. We have especially appreciated the very friendly and attentive service of the staff and the consistent attractive presentation of their tasty food.  This is the best value in Boulder City for a full plate of nicely presented, delicious home-style food in a lovely and gracious setting. I had the turkey dinner, my husband had the battered fish. The portions for dinners were more than generous AND they include soup and salad bar! My soup was a hearty, homemade potato and the other option was chicken noodle. The salad bar is clean, nicely appointed with excellent, moist corn bread, plus many choices of dressing. The wines by the glass were a reasonable $4 - how can you beat that?  We were too full to peruse the dessert options, but I must say we were delighted and impressed with our dining experience! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with family. We came after the breakfast rush.    Surprisingly delicious made-to-order breakfast items:  pancakes, eggs, bacon, fruits, coffee, milk, juice.  All Fresh. Attentive and helpful staff.   Relaxing and quiet ambiance.  My family had a lovely dining experience."}
{"text":"Aside from the atmosphere that is engulfed in historical significance, I felt like the food was made right from the freezer. So incredibly overpriced."}
{"text":"If you are passing through Boulder City, you must stop here for breakfast or lunch!  First, this place is historical hotel... totally cool! Our group of 7 sat in the sunroom. It was charming. The waitress was very friendly.  My dad was in the mood for breakfast and ordered the Chicken Fried Steak, eggs and potatoes. It was huge!!! He totally loved it and he is a very picky person!  My mom ordered the Cuban Sandwich with the fajita chicken soup. She really enjoyed her meal.  My husband also ordered the Cuban but he got sweet potato fries. The fries came with a spicy apricot dipping sauce. He said it was delicious! Both Cuban's came with a large dill pickle. I ordered the Monte Cristo with the Fiesta Chicken Soup. My sandwich was HUGE... I literally had to smoosh it to even take a bite.  My kids had the eggs with cinnamon toast breakfast... and let me tell you.... they are very picky eaters. They cleared their plates!! Our entire group was extremely satisfied with our food. If we ever drive through here again, we will stop in and eat here!  They had large portions for way good prices!"}
{"text":"I just experienced something so so incredibly audacious and tacky from this place of business I honestly do not know where to begin.     On the afternoon of Sunday March 25, 2018 I had a planned recreational trip for antiques with a male friend. I recommend Boulder City as THE place for antiques compared to my experiences in Las Vegas so we made the long winded journey from Vegas this day. The time was 1:20 PM. My friend had made mention to me if his hunger and I agreed with him we should eat. He spotted The Boulder Hotel sign resterant and it closed at 2pm. I told him I had read on a theBoulder City website it had a ton of history along with it being nationally recognized.     Both of us walked thru the doors and saw the place was very full. There were some unbussed tables, okay fine. We stood at what looked like a hostess stand. The funny thing was no one, not one of the staff members greeted us. Not a waitress, a hostess, a busser, a manager...NO ONE. Also when we were standing for the 3-4 minutes  at the hostess stand a middle aged lady came out and looked at us funny, like we were not suppose to be there or it was a crime. I had to administer a conversation as to the fact we would like to get seated. She answered back well we are not seating anyone else because we basically ran out of food. Her words not mine and it wasn't even closing time. If she and the restaurant workers were smart you would have had the common sense to put up a sign not only on the resterant doors but in the exterior of the hotel.     The ungreaceful lady was even weirder as me and my make friend were walking out of THE RESTERANT as we decided to go to a real dinning establishment that actually served food. She was clumsily hovering over and behind us as we decided to just walk out at the doors and give us excuses why the do not have food. That was odd and uncalled for."}
{"text":"I'd love to say they are still going strong but the last few times we have been there the food was truly awful. The service has gone downhill too.. Not bad but not as stellar as before. Just an FYI."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here because it came included with staying the night at the hotel.  It was a GREAT breakfast for being an add on to the room.  I had an omelette made to order, hash browns and toast.  The homemade salsa that was brought out was very good as well."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Homemade corned beef hash is the best. The home made chicken fried steak is also good. Everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"Walked in, the sign said \"seat yourself\".  There was a lot of open tables for four but there were five of us.  We found a table for eight.  It was dirty and had reserve signs.  The VERY RUDE WAITRESS said \"I just have to wipe the table\".  I said what about the reserved sign?  She jerked the signs off and walked away.  We waited by the table for about 5 minutes while she walked around waiting on other tables.  (Never smiling at anyone she was waiting on) No one else came over to wipe the tables.  No wonder there were lots of open tables!!!!!  Should have been my first clue.  We had to wait 45 minutes at the next place a block away!! It's not hard to make a breakfast place good if you have good service.  I suggest this place get some better servers or at least a couple that can smile.  The three I passed on the way in and out didn't.  Or at least a hostess with a smile."}
{"text":"Absolutly great breakfast!  We stayed at the boulder dam hotel and had breakfast here.  I had the biscuits and gravy and it was great.  Eggs Benedict is also a good choice."}
